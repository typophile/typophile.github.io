body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nfirst post here - I'm delighted to see so many famous names hanging
  around :)\r\n\r\nOn to my humble request...\r\nAs a typophiliac, semantics-obsessed
  scientist I frequently typeset texts containing various scientific terms and notations.
  Whenever publishing guidelines are not strict, I usually opt for some pretty typeface
  I deem suitable. However, the choice appears rather limited due to a few characters
  absent from many, many fonts, even the most expensive or carefully crafted ones:
  a few greek letters, a superscript \"+\". Remember your high school chemistry lectures
  and these awful equations? (CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O = Ca2+ + 2 HCO3) Remember the Czernobyl
  disaster and its bunch of alpha, beta and gamma rays? Well... most typefaces cannot
  accurately convey this information.\r\n\r\nI hear you say \"just use the 'superscript'
  'subscript' functions in your word processor\" and \"type a, b, g and switch to
  Symbol font\". Unfortunately, that's not how things should work, for both practical
  and ethical reasons. Practical: a 'g' is a 'g' is NOT a 'gamma'. Copy-paste between
  various apps that don't care about fonts, you end up with hard-to-decipher sentences
  where one can not distinguish between what was a greek letter and what is a latin
  letter. Let your text be indexed by Google or whatever scientific tool you use,
  everything is stored as plain text - your pretty 'gamma G' is actually some meaningless
  'GG'. From a more \"philosophical\" viewpoint, characters that look exactly similar
  may have very different <em>meanings</em>, hence the need for specific rules and
  notations (e.g. in Unicode) - 'hyphen' is not 'minus' is not 'dash', <em>semantically</em>.
  A superscript '+' in a formula is not just a '+' above baseline; it conveys a very
  different kind of information (one is a logical operator, the other a symbol for
  ions). Even to a trained chemist, <em>d13C(CO32-+Ca2++14C6)2</em> asks for misreading.\r\n\r\nI
  know designing a good typeface is a lot of work. Let's not ask for every font out
  there to support polytonic greek and the full unicode charset. But... everytime
  you neglect a superscript '-' or '+', everytime you omit those few greek letters
  used routinely by scientists worldwide (alpha beta gamma delta epsilon...), you
  make your pretty baby look less cute to a small but interesting part of the publishing
  community... ;)\r\nNothing could excite me more than Hypatia Sans Pro (or any other
  great Adobe typeface) getting the 'sups+' it deserves... (Solace: Canada Type just
  released Aragon ST,  it's next on my shopping list!)\r\n\r\n<em>Off-topic</em>:
  anybody having experience with upgrade policies at Adobe? I recently bought the
  Italics pack to complement Hypatia Sans Pro, and I end up with much newer versions
  (2.072?) than the old Hypatia upright weights that once came as a goodie from Adobe
  (1.008). According to the readme files, many quirks were fixed inbetween. I haven't
  noticed striking discrepancies yet but I'm worried mixing both packages could lead
  to visual glitches. Still, couldn't find any info about discount upgrade paths for
  fonts at Adobe.com. Agreed, I'm dreaming aloud :)\r\n\r\nCheers"

    a trustworthy list for \"math/science language support\"? If not this thread would
    be one place we could construct one. \r\n\r\nWhat is implied by the ellipsis after
    \"alpha beta gamma delta epsilon...\"?"

    subset of what Cambria Math offers, different people will want different subset

    Times/Calibri/whatever common font you find will be way better than using the
    Symbol font as it's at least encoded correctly.\r\n\r\n[Disclaimer: I'm not a

  body: "This is an area that I am looking into at the moment. I have added some of
    those features into fonts myself, to support content that requires correct Unicode
    support and the OpenType features to implement it.\r\n\r\nAre you aware of/do
    you use, [[http://www.mathjax.org/|MathJax]]? It takes advantage of the [[http://www.stixfonts.org/|STIX
    fonts]] and was created to address the need for math and scientific communities
    publishing content on the web.\r\n\r\n[[https://github.com/khaledhosny/xits-math|XITS]]
    is a project which aims to create an OpenType implementation of the STIX fonts.\r\n\r\nRoss
    Mills, who did a lot of the engineering work on Cambria Math has also produced,
    [[http://www.tiro.com/Maxwell/Maxwell_beta_1.5_spec.pdf|Maxwell (this link leads
    to a PDF display or download depending on your browser)]].\r\n\r\nThere is also
    an open source font called, [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/Asana-Math/|Asana
    Math]] designed to address the same need for typesetting within MS Word 2007/2010
    as Cambria Math. It also works with XeTeX.\r\n\r\nImplementing the features and
    support that you require is definitely something that individuals and small groups
    are mindful of but doing it well can be extremely time consuming and difficult,
    which means that it is unlikely to see widespread adoption."

  body: "OK,\r\nsorry for the delayed reply.\r\n\r\nFirst let me say  \"math\" writing
    is a separate issue. As someone already mentioned, it is a very narrow niche that
    relies on an inordinate amount of weird glyphs (no offense!); furthermore, having
    a dedicated font comprising both scientific and common glyphs is largely unnecessary
    for math, given how publications in this field usually typeset equations 'out
    of the text'.\r\n\r\nI went combing my bibliographic database for normal science
    articles (in the field of natural and physical sciences) issued in both mainstream
    (~Science, Nature...) and highly-specialized journals (Acta Geologica Sinica).
    It seems the range of characters needed for run-in sentences is way lower than
    with maths. Roughly: a range of lowercase greek letters (alpha beta gamma delta
    epsilon seem the most common), subscript/superscript numbers and usual mathematical
    operators (\u208A\u208B\u208C\u208D\u208E\u207A\u207B\u207C\u207D\u207E\u207F),
    permil, and extended-latin glyphs (to account for east-european and turkish names...
    however foreign localities and names using exotic alphabets are almost invariably
    latinized - no need for cyrillic or simplified chinese glyphs!). I'll gladly dig
    into other scientific-non-mathematic fields e.g. medical biology and the such,
    to check if additional glyphs are routinely used.\r\n\r\nSome composite - and
    largely non-sensical - example:\r\n<cite>In this study, \u2078\u2077Sr/\u2078\u2076Sr
    ratios were calculated for samples of Mn\u2074\u207A-rich carbonates according
    to the method by Chlup\xE1\u010D et al. (1989). In addition, a \u03B4\xB9\u2078O
    signal of 5.3\xB10.07\u2030 for the phosphate fraction was measured by \u03B3-diffractometry
    for samples of average composition (X\u207F\u207AY\xB2\u207F)\u2082(CO\u2083)\u2082.</cite>\r\nImpossible
    to type that sentence \"semantically\" using e.g. the widespread and highly functional
    Myriad... for lack of a superscript plus.\r\n\r\nI agree that \"Times & Cambria
    & Helvetica & Lucida Sans Unicode & Comic Sans\" ought to be enough for anybody
    in the academia. Still I wonder whether these typefaces are used and abused because
    they're the top of the crop, or because nothing else is there to overthrow them...
    ;) Please bear in mind that communication is at the very heart of science, and
    increasingly so - scientific communication and popularization is now taught at
    universities, and includes how to use infographics etc.\r\n\r\nBy the way, many
    science [e]books/textbooks but the driest ones use a surprising diversity of font
    combinations. I've already noticed Berkeley, Frutiger, Dante, Myriad, Warnock
    among others... a bit more fanciful than old boring Times, yet legible and serious
    enough for serious matters. The Proceedings volume of the last conference I attended
    had a <em>pretty</em> cover featuring some Stempel Garamond. No heart attack in
    the audience... none that I know of ;)\r\n\r\nedit: just got me a weight of Aragon
    ST (new typeface intended for scientific writing), and it appears to have all
    the glyphs I need. However their encoding is a bit... strange (relying on stylistic
    sets and Co.). Richler looks great, but lacks that damn sups+."
