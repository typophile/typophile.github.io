body: "I am designing this typeface, it's my first attempt at a flushed out font.
  I had a general question on consitant widths - Specifically, on the contrast areas
  when compairing the caps and lc letters. Should these two widths be the same?\r\n\r\nHere
  is a partial preview of the font\r\n(see image with orange arrows)"

  body: The consistency in widths, I think, is unnecessary. <em>IF</em> the letters
    combine well together.

  body: "Hi, Emel.\r\n\r\nI have found that uppercase stem widths should be a little
    wider than lowercase. And I think maybe also in the contrast areas. But you will
    have to judge by eye how much difference in thickness is best. \r\nI think the
    difference in your example is too big, but that's just my opinion.\r\n\r\nmksg\r\n "
