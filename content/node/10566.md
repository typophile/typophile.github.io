  body: I agree, I&#39;ve been waiting for this for EVER. Does anyone know if the
    fractions are tabular or proportionally spaced? Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but don&#39;t
    all kinds of numbers need to be proprtionally spaced for setting in text, even
    fractions? <BR> <BR>By the way Jamie, I hope you&#39;re kidding about that Judy
    Garland CD. It&#39;s rubbish!

  body: They are both gorgeous, IMHO, and I will have to keep looking at them both.
    I&#39;ll willingly ponder aloud the idea that Mercury and Farnham could be used
    together. Perhaps using Farnham for the display purposes and Mercury for other?
    While they are both, IMHO, serious versions of the style, I can see that the H&amp;FJ
    version maintains a more serious stance, while the Farnham appears to be a little
    more effervescent. I wouldn&#39;t say which is best. Too many different things.
    Mercury offers a serious multiple-use typeface with enough style--along the lines
    of Requiem for instance--which can perform beyond the printed page. Farnham on
    the other hand does have some traits of a workhorse, but also has a willingness
    to show-off. I do like the serifs a lot on Farnham. I also love that it has swash
    characters but wonder why they only offer a Display Swash in regular. Well, I&#39;m
    going to see if I can&#39;t find downloadable PDFs and keep staring, I mean of
    course after I work.
