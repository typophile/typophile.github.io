  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We&#39;ve got a flash project that we are trying to squeeze every cpu cycle out of. <BR>Obviously the best way to do this and get any form or decent quality, is to go with bitmaps, rather than vectors in low-quality mode. <BR>So we&#39;re looking to test the performance of greyscale fonts in Flash in low-quailty mode. <BR>If this works out I guess we&#39;ll have to investigate the next steps of building such a font, although after reading previous posts in this forum it might be a lot less painful to us if we outsouce it. <BR> <BR>So... we&#39;re looking for a demo greyscal bitmap font to be tested in flash MX 2004. <BR> <BR>Any offers ?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hold on. The Ultrafonts stuff is still outlines: they&#39;re pixelfonts, outline fonts designed to render out crisp anti-aliased type &#40;the best stuff to read onscreen&#41; at a single point size. I doubt they will render out faster &#40;although their lack of curves <i>might</i> make a slight difference&#41;. So I think Robert might be talking about one of the relatively new features of Flash: the ability to render out an internal actual bitmap font &#40;from an outline font&#41; and then use that instead; the problem is I think that doesn&#39;t work with grayscale - although I think it might depend on platform -not sure though. <BR> <BR>And a side question: what point size are you looking for? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm... was a bit worried about that. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re basically trying to get away from using vector fonts &#40;outlines fonts with or without &#39;clever&#39; hinting&#41;. <BR> <BR>Nor are we too worried about &#39;tiny&#39; fonts, but rather more traditional &#34;Arial&#39; derivatives at 12px, 14px and 18px. So there is no real worry about &#39;blurry&#39; visuals at very small font sizes. <BR> <BR>We are ONLY worried about performance issues. <BR> <BR>Ideally we would like to use &#39;low-quality&#39; mode fonts in flash and have the nice anti-aliased edges of &#39;high-quality&#39; mode. <BR> <BR>The only way I can see this happening, is if there is a bitmap font... the trick is... does flash support greyscale bitmap fonts or not... <BR> <BR>...if it does, all I really want to be able to do is convert a standard outline font into a greyscale one and use it in Flash. <BR> <BR>...if it doesn&#39;t, then there are 2 ways forward. <BR>1. Use standard 1 bit fonts during high calculation areas, and then use high quality mode for notifications and interaction. &#42;ugh&#42; <BR>2. Use a bitmap based lookup graphic element table and chain &#39;words&#39; together. Just requires more programming I guess, and kerning goes right out the window. Then for the interactive areas, I would then switch to standard fonts in high quality mode. &#42;not so ugh, just more work&#42; <BR> <BR>I guess it all really depends on how thoroughly flash has embraced the relatively not-so-new TTF specification. &#42;heh&#42; <BR> <BR>Any further light ? <BR> <BR>Rob.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mana comes in 13&#42; and 16 PPEM - you can see them on the Ultrafonts site. It&#39;s probably not too expensive for you to buy them just to test; and if they don&#39;t work you might find a use for them in the future. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which actually has an Arial air to it, at least in the Regular lowercase. <BR> <BR>I think a decent fallback would be to use a 1-bit font, which I&#39;m pretty sure that new Flash feature can handle. But hopefully you can get grayscale to work. <BR> <BR>Do let us know what happens! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;ve had a quick look at Mana on Ultrafonts. <BR>Unfortunately if you right click and choose &#39;quality- low&#39; in the flash player, we go straight back to the beginning, and the fonts become very aliased. <BR> <BR>Is there no such thing as a font that contains no outline data, but only bitmap data ? <BR>Greyscale if possible ? <BR> <BR>All I&#39;m really looking for is a test greyscale bitmap ttf font to play with. It doesn&#39;t even have to have real glyphs in it. We&#39;re only interested in seeing if it works in Flash, and if there is any performance boost over standard outline fonts. <BR> <BR>Can anyone send us a &#39;demo&#39; greyscale bitmap ttf font to test ? <BR> <BR>Rob.</div>

Ultrafonts technology is the better solution actually available for greyscale fonts custom type design with a crossplatform ttf solution. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR> <BR>Miguel Hern</div>
