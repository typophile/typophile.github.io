body: I think it would be more convenient to have a string of links to the different
  forums across the bottom or top of each page ( GENERAL DISCUSSIONS  /  DESIGN  /
  TYPE ID BOARD  ... )  here in Typophile, so we could go directly to the discussions
  we're looking for without clicking "FORUMS" each time...

  body: Are you using using RSS, Chuck? I think you'll find it very helpful in tracking
    all new threads and new posts in specific discussions. Thanks to RSS, I rarely
    ever need to visit the home page or the Forums page.

  body: at the risk of sounding "out of the loop," i'm not even sure i know what RSS
    is... when i select the Typophile RSS link to the right, i always get a page of
    code...

  body: You need an RSS reader, though most modern browsers can handle it now. What
    browser/platform are you using?

  body: "well, i'm using what i believe is the latest version of safari on a mac.\r\n\r\ni
    should probably know more about RSS than i do. but even having said that, would
    it be difficult for typophile to show the forum links as a list or row on the
    pages?"

  body: "I don't know. I have no control of the site features or design. Even if there
    were links I think RSS is the best way to read Typophile, so I highly recommend
    you give it a go. Safari can subscribe to RSS. Check out the app's Help on the
    topic. Then subscribe to any feeds you want to follow. \r\n\r\nYou can follow
    your participated threads without RSS by clicking the \"track\" link on your profile
    page."
