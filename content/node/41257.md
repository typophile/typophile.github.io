  body: "Thanks, Thomas.\r\nYeah, I love Belwe, too. I\u2019m glad to have a project
    here where it actually fits.\r\n\r\nClearface, Korinna and Cheltenham look too
    - ehm - ITCish for my taste. Candida is too similar. I\u2019d like to have some
    contrast, but also harmony. I think it should be rather a serif, but sans suggestions
    are welcome as well."

  body: "Well, I kept the Belwe titles/heads and used Scala for text.\r\nI tried about
    everything from above but nothing really worked for me.\r\nI\u2019m still not
    sure if Scala is the best choice but there comes the time when you have to make
    a decision ;-)"
