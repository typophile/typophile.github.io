body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am currently writing a book on typography in France,
  and I am looking for any and every information you might have available on Evert
  Bloemsma and the typeface FF Cocon. I've been on his website archive, but the visuals
  are long gone (especially the 1969 alitalia logo, which I just can't find)... I
  saw that there seems to be some really interesting stuff, such as sketches and early
  versions, on one of the fiffteen exhibition panels, but I can't find these in a
  good resolution. So... Any information about the genesis of the type and any visual
  documents would be extremely appreciated, as well as biographical informations about
  the late Evert Bloemsma - what I have is quite thin.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDavid R\r\n\r\nps:
  I am in the process of finishing the book and will be heavily looking for visual
  or informative contributions in the next few month, do not be surprised if I post
  some requests here and there... "

  body: I know that Martin Majoor (FF Scala and more ...) has been a friend of Evert
    Bloemsma. Perhaps you should contact him. He lives in Arnheim (NL) and Warsaw
    (PL). Or perhaps you should contact Erik Spiekermann.

  body: "Hey David, I\u2019m interested in Evert\u2019s work, too. What I found so
    far are chapters from <cite>Dutch Type</cite> (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=sR9g5xPPJVQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dutch+Type&sig=g7pNTJ9wKGj2aKpEFv_jNYwtdPw\">available
    in full-text at Google Books</a>) and <cite>Made with FontFont</cite> (<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/made-with-fontfont/\">announcement</a>,
    <a href=\"http://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/26/made-with-fontfont/\">review</a>).
    There\u2019s also the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14636?\">wiki page about
    FF Legato</a> here on Typophile that links to the <cite><a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/ff%20-%20legato_about.pdf\">About
    FF Legato</a></cite> PDF. Me and Joe enquired briefly about Evert to Luc(as) de
    Groot in Brighton, but he doesn\u2019t seem to know much more than we do. Jan
    Middendorp, the author of <cite>Dutch Type</cite> might be the person to get in
    touch with about it. I also read that Evert used to publish a lot of articles
    about his theories in type design, but I can\u2019t find any (or I\u2019m not
    looking in the right places, as I don\u2019t speak any Dutch).\r\n\r\nSince you\u2019re
    working on typography in France, I would suggest you take a close look at FF Balance
    as well if you haven\u2019t already, because it stems from Bloemsma\u2019s fascination
    with Roger Excoffon\u2019s work on Antique Olive.\r\n\r\nDo let us know. Cheers!\r\n"

  body: "verbosus:\r\n\r\nthanks for all the tips, i'm going to take a look at all
    these things.\r\n\r\nI took a look at FF Balance, of course, but i chose to mainly
    speak about cocon for it is a very successful typeface and it is really one of
    a kind, but getting info about it is tricky. i can't understand why nobody thought
    of saving evert's website while it was online...\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\ni'll
    keep you informed,\r\n\r\ndavid r"
