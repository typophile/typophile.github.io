  I'm being interviewed this afternoon between 3 and 4 pm for <a href=\"http://www.radio1.be/radio1_master/programmas/neo/r1_neo_home/index.html\">Neon</a>,
  a program on <a href=\"http://www.radio1.be/\">Radio 1</a> (Belgian national radio),
  about 50 years of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI hope I don't screw up! :^P\r\n\r\nBTW I'll
  be proudly wearing my \"Who needs Helvetica?\" Hattenbach T-shirt. Figures..."
