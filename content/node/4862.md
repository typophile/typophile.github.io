  body: J -- First you start out with the text of the card, then you sketch out possibilities
    either by hand or by computer printout on approximations of various card stock.
    The typeface will suggest itself if you work at it long and hard enough. That
    is, if you really study each face for the characteristics that will make your
    solution succeed.
