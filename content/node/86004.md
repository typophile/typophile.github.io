  on my personal logo. I'm using Futura at the moment for the 'Jessica Chapman' text,
  but I would prefer to use a less common typeface. The main reason I chose to use
  Futura was because I felt the simplistic shape of the Futura 'J' complemented my
  custom-made J. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jesslogo_5021.jpg]"

  body: 'I like how simple your logo. I see a problem with one of your curves in the
    logo, looks a bit pixeled but if you fixed that small issue it would be perfect. '
