  your help.\r\nasd 2818 just doesn't seem to be a popular choice amongst collectors
  - so there is no scanned cover out there right now.\r\n\"wtf's\" results therefore
  were rather \"wtf!##\"\r\n;)\r\n\r\nperhaps a few hints on he font:\r\nto me it
  has something trajanesque (i went through tagged search on wtf but couldn't get
  a match)\r\ncapital_y is half-palm\r\ncipher_2 has a unique (closed?) curl\r\nup-
  and downward serifs are rather pointy\r\nsidewards serifs - very hard to tell whether
  they are a little curved or this is the  result of bad photo-resolution\r\nsmall
  letters are rather wide - small_a is very nicely shaped, perhaps leaning a bit to
  the left; small_t has an interesting downward serif on the cross-bar\r\n\r\nthank
  you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/1111_6431.JPG]"

    to an old style antiqua/humanist?\r\n\r\ni absolutely get the similarities with
    some of the schneidler letters which you proposed.\r\nall in all i am not convinced
    though - the dissimilarities are too striking in the end\r\n(i don't have any
    bauer specimen book to compare to admittedly)\r\n\r\nrecording is from '70 (production
    no later than '72)\r\ndesign for hmv and angel identical (GB)\r\n\r\nwhat do you
    make of the ciphers btw?"

  body: 'The curved serifs seem to be sonme sort of a Schneider like Don said but
    it does not fit any I can find. The Y seems to be the key but can not find one
    like it with the other letters having curved serifs. '

  body: "The photolettering/filmtype firms had first class lettering artists who redrew
    many of the classic fonts. Sometimes as formal fonts, but more often as not they
    were custom projects for record labels, book covers etc. Most of these creations
    have not been digitized. Circa 1970 was at the peak of this process.\r\nDon"

    the only legit digital version available is the all-caps handtooled Augustea Open
    (http://www.myfonts.com/search/name%3A%28augustea+open%29).\r\nThe font in the

  body: I looked at Nova Augustea  and even just Augustea samples the other day but
    while the Y is close it is those curved "fishtail" serifs that do not fit. I also
    checked several other Butti/Novarese designs but nothing close - this has to be
    out somewhere, will look more.

    little nap - and here we are with bold results!\r\n\r\nthe small letters hint
    very much towards nova augustea.\r\ni'd love to award the title of problem solver
    - but am not sure what typophile etiquette says: first come first serve OR original
    font priority over digital match?\r\nboth kthomps5 and riccard0 came up with great
    info!\r\nthanks to don & bob for research as well!\r\ni slowly get an idea what
    photolettering was about - i do imagine they took nova augustea and blended it
    by overlay with the schneidler serifs - would that be roughly right, don?\r\n\r\nhave
    a round of thank-you-typophile-trivial-pursuit:\r\n\r\nwhich type setter by profession
    was elected president of his country by popular vote?"
