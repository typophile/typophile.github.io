  body: Actually, there are at least 2 different typefaces. I can see 2 different
    /E ([[http://typophile.com/files/w7_3558.jpg|here]] and [[http://typophile.com/files/w4_4242.jpg|here]]),
    /M ([[http://typophile.com/files/w7_3558.jpg|here]] and [[http://typophile.com/files/w4_4242.jpg|here]])
    and /R ([[http://typophile.com/files/w4_4242.jpg|here]] and [[http://typophile.com/files/w3_5919.jpg|here]])
    and I don't know any font with such a [[http://typophile.com/files/w6_5083.jpg|double-sided
    /G crossbar]]. Have you look at everything I listed?

  body: "Actually, the more I look at it the more I think it's a customization of
    existing typefaces. Nothing is really consistent:\r\n- \"WTAPS\": /S should be
    \"slab-serifed\" too but it's not, making me thinking they could have started
    with some \"[[http://typophile.com/node/99935#comment-539470|United Sans]]-like\",
    manually adding slab-serifs\r\n- \"LIMA\" VS. \"WTAPS\": nothing matches (different
    weight, different /A...). \"LIMA\" is actually matching many \"NBA\" font from
    Eriq Jaffe's collection I've already pointed to.\r\n- /76 counter: also inconsistent
    with both \"WTAPS\" and \"LIMA\" designs. Counter can't be square but hexagonal/faceted
    if had to match \"WTAPS\" or /7 would have been bottom serifed to match \"LIMA\"."
