  one set of configurations works best for sans serif and another for serif fonts?
  Is there one universal setting? Or is it just trial and error until one finds their

    as possible &#40;ie, Minimum, Optimum and Maximum Char space set to either the
    same or a teeny bit different -- like -0.5, 0, 0.5&#41;; <BR> <BR>With most typefaces,
    Optimum word space can come down significantly &#40;like to 85 or 90%&#41;. Char
    space can often come down too &#40;like -3, -2.5, -2&#41;; <BR> <BR>Auto hyphenation
    off -- best do it manually. <BR> <BR>ymmv, obviously. <BR> <BR>R'
