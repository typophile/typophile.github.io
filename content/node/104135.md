  I wonder what fonts or fonts have the comb over ampersand shown on the Saks & Company
  street level lettering?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AmpersandSaks&Company_5225.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "So this stumps the typophiles?\r\nPresumably this lettering style dates to
    when the store was  designed by department store specialists Starrett & Van Vleck
    and built in 1922-24? The bronze letters may be more recent but the ampersand
    matches the style of the large letters over the entrance.\r\nSee <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilio_guerra/4956479090/\">photo
    of front entrance</a>, with architecural information.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon"

    design squares is missing. Perhaps suggestive of a company that may be ready for
    takeover.\r\nDon"
