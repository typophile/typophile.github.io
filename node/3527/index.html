		<div class="commentbody">To help on one of your fonts to get you started is fine, I think, but really, this is your assignment, and I think you should do it yourself. I'm not going to be a completely wet blanket about it, though: I'll give you the link to <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/">Brands of the World</a>, a site with thousands of worldwide company logos. Spend some time sifting through there, and I'm sure you'll find examples of the fonts you're looking for. <BR> <BR>This has been advice of the &quot;give Mikey a fish and he'll eat for a day, teach Mikey to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime&quot; variety. It's given with the utmost respect for the challenges you face as a student. <BR> <BR>Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Let me also add &ndash; and I know this is totally unhelpful &ndash; that I do sympathize with you, as I think it's an utterly ridiculous assignment. Better, I think, to have the assignment be more like what we do here everyday, i.e., taking a sample and identifying the type. Your assignment is the other way around, and I just don't see the value of it. It's kind of like a wild goose chase. <BR> <BR>That said, it's your assignment, and therefore it's your responsibility. If you can, however, choose a different instructor next time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I strongly agree with Chesh that it's not our job to do your homework, primarily because you don't learn anything except how to ask for help (sometimes not a bad thing to do either). <BR> <BR>If your assignment is to find logos (or advertisements?) that use  a certain list of typefaces, that is a bogus way to do it, but I'm not your instructor.  <BR> <BR>If the assignment is to identify 50 different typefaces used in ads, then you need a decent set of font samples (i.e. a good font book would be nice), and then start flipping through lots of magazines with plenty of advertising, like Fashion and Travel magazines. <BR> <BR>If you were a real font fanatic, like some of us, you would already have had a folder of ads ripped from magazines with font names written on them. <BR> <BR>Welcome to the wild world of Font Spotting! <BR> <BR></div>
