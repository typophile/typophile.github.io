body: "Hello All, \r\nHoping I might get some helpful advice on kerning this type.
  I'm looking at the two Xs as well as the L and S as potential starting places.  As
  it stands the leg of the L is slightly shortened to reduce the amount of negative
  space between the L and S. The  + sign aligns with the center of the H. \r\n\r\nMy
  original intent was to keep the type in a tight rectangular shape. Looking at it
  now I'm not sure what the best strategy would  be\_\u2013  tighten the space (possibly
  overlap the two X's) or instead increase the amount of space around the other letterforms
  for balance. Perhaps the leading is an issue as well.\r\n\r\nAny insights or tips
  would be appreciated. "

    drawing your own to fill more of the space? \r\n\r\nAlso, have you tried aligning
    the <strong>F</strong> with the median position of the <strong>W</strong>'s left
    slope, rather than with its utmost tip?"
