  (Portugal) and this year is all dedicated to typography. My teacher gave me this
  exercice to do for tuesday: to create an alfabet with different typefaces that must
  content fonts from different \xE9poces, authors and fisionomies. I've been searching
  about the earliest typefaces used since the Gutenberg invented the letterpress and
  I couldn't find the 1st font ever used. Do you have any idea of what it can be?\r\n\r\nThanks
  \r\n\r\nMafalda :)"

  body: This is usually referred to as the 42-line Bible type, i.e the type used in
    Gutenberg's first folio Bible, which had 42 lines of text per page.

  body: Making an alphabet with type designs from all the different eras is pretty
    much doomed to failure by the way.  Ask your teacher why since repetition and
    homogenization are so vital to type design how in the world can they expect you
    to come up with anything good.

  body: Walden Font has what looks like a decent implementation as well; it seems
    you can only buy it in a set with their other gothic faces, but it's USD$60 for
    the lot, which is pretty reasonable (and some of the others are quite nice-looking).

    It's available at Typoasis.\r\n\r\nOther versions not mentioned above include

    the thread what <em>you</em> mean by font. For example, if you mean something
    close to \u201Cthe oldest instance of mark-making used to communicate with a fixed
    set of glyphs\u201D then we can go <strong>thousands</strong> of years before
    Gutenberg.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disc_3807.JPG]\r\n<em>Figure
    1</em>: Something for you to Google.\r\n\r\nAnd for the record, the Chinese invented
    a movable type system like Gutenberg\u2019s about 100 years sooner.\r\n\r\nAlready,
    we have departed from Latin glyphs to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram#Logographic_systems\">logograms</a>.\r\n\r\nBefore
    you go any further, define what you mean by font.\r\n\r\nAnd if you are going
    to use a forum to assist you in your research, be sure to cite and reference it
    in your paper. The proper way to do this (according to the American Psychological
