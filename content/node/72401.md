  contains vehicular lane movement arrows used in standard traffic engineering reports.
  Before I venture into creating such a font, does anyone know of any existing fonts
  that are contained in the attached graphics.\r\n\r\nBasically there are six arrows
  per cardinal compass direction (north, south, east, west)creating a total of twenty
  four separate arrows. The six arrows per direction are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Left
  Only\r\n2) Shared Left-Through\r\n3) Through Only\r\n4) Shared Left-Through-Right\r\n5)
  Shared Through-Right\r\n6) Right Only\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample graphic.\r\n\r\nThank
  you much,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    as Adobe Illustrator, allow any graphic to be saved as a Symbol. That ought to
    give much more flexibility (i.e., when extending lines and such).\r\n\r\nYour
    sample sure looks like something that's been drawn with a fully-capable vector
    package."

  body: "We are currently using Autocad to prepare our graphics. The graphics are
    prepared manually. I'm working to automate these using excel formulas. Software
    input and output for capacity analysis are integers. My goal is to have excel
    read the numbers associated with the myraid combinations of lane movements are
    various intersections.\r\n\r\nFor example the input 1, 1, 1 represents one dedicated
    through lane, one dedicated left-turn lane and one dedicated right-turn lane.
    I want to turn this into a left arrow, though arrow, and right arrow."

    both the end product is not professional looking. The ESRI MUTCD font set does
    not have all the arrow movements. "

    one thing.\r\nThe other thing is if you want to do computing with them. I guess
    you would need a kind of encoding the arrows as characters so that a computer
    can process them in a logical/mathematical manner.  "

  body: "Who would I use to create the fonts, and what are the costs?\r\n\r\nThe \"computing\"
    logic is simply built into the Excel formulas. For example if the formula reads
    \"1\" for the left-turn lane then it would result in the ASCII character that
    yield the correct arrow within the new font. The cell is simply formated to use
    the new font. So let's say the left-turn arrow is \"t\" in the new font, then
    the result of the formula would place a \"t\" within the cell. The cell would
    be formated with the new font and yield the arrow symbol."

  body: "...one more thought.\r\n\r\nThe Excel worksheet also uses the formula function
    \"=concatenate()\" that has the ability to create a text string from multiple
    cell values. In this way I intend to create the string of arrows that represent
    any lane designation at an intersection."

  body: I would look at using Excel's Shapes as an overlay, these can be auto-generated
    through a macro. This will allow you greater flexibility of layout than trying
    to create a custom font.

  body: I have a feeling you're missing a combination... (7) shared left-right (no
    through) (as on the attached pdf diagrams 1-4).

  body: matesrates - I'm intrigued by your suggestion. Can you provide a reference
    site or tutorial that would fully explain how a macro would automatically generate
    and manipulate the location of graphic images (ie shapes) based upon numerical
    data in cells.

  body: Nick Job - Thank you! You are correct, the shared left-right lane arrow in
    each of the cardinal directions would also be necessary. That would make a total
    of twenty eight (28) separate symbols.
