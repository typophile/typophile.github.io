  My THESIS is creating \"a designers guide\" to vision related problems. Specifically,
  Central/Peripheral blurriness. In the end I am creating a typeface for this. I am
  familiar with the AIGA article but I could use more help.\r\n\r\nThankyou,\r\nPrakash

    something similar with Dyslexia and I assume there are going to be some parralels
    in both of our research....although I must admit this is more than a semester
    long project."

  body: Prakash Nair, as I commented on the AIGA article, my Italian colleague Luciano
    Perondi is working on the subject, he founded a research team - http://progetto-exp.org
    - you might find useful to contact him.

  body: "Hi Prakash,\r\nI hope you found the info you needed. This project got quite
    complex to be honest, and I ended up conducting sample research at local elementary
    schools in the Detroit area in order to get sufficient data. If you would like,
    I can send you copies of any of the research I compiled.\r\n\r\nThe first round
    of the project lasted about 10 months, and I have recently picked it back up again.
    For round two, I am focusing on kinesthetic feedback rather than typography however."

  body: I just did some research on low vision.  Check out the nation blind organisations
    like CNIB (canada) RNIB (uk).  the canadian site offers a 'clear print guide'
    with some results from their research.  Verdana, is the way to go acording to
    them.

    serifed type either.\r\n\r\n<em>I am creating a typeface for this.</em>\r\n\r\nWhile
    on principle I wouldn't want to discourage novices from designing type for the
    reading-challenged (two words: Louis Braille), I don't believe that their efforts
    will be any better than any standard typeface by an experienced designer, in fact,
    much less effective.\r\n\r\nSure, it's great that some publishers are using such
    types, but it says more about committment and empowerment than pure functionality.\r\n\r\nFrom
    both a scientific and design process standpoint, it would make more sense to analyze
    exisiting typefaces for their suitability for the reading-challenged, and then
    base one's typeface design on that knowledge, rather than working from abstract
    principles such as \"disambiguation of shapes\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
