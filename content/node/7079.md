  am working on a huge project.   <BR>The main components are worksheets to collect
  personal information. Some journals, calendars and instruction materials will also
  need created. <BR>This require a very friendly easy to read combination of typefaces.
  Something that anyone between the ages of 30 to 60 would be comforatable with. <BR>It
  is for a product geared towards women. <BR> <BR>Franklin Gothic is my definite san
  serif choice.  <BR> <BR>I was thinking leawood for the serif because of its legibility
  and the fact that it has a very &#34;pretty&#34; italic. But now I am second guessing
  that choice.  <BR> <BR>I would love to know what all you think! <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance  <BR> <BR>Cathy
