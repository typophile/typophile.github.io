  please tell me in what typeface family does the \"Coffee\" in this candy logo fit
  better? I really like it, it conveys a sense of elegance and modernity, though I'm
  not sure if it's technically a modern font. The \"Brazilian\" is interesting too,
  but since it's in italics I dn't hae a hint of its family.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
