  got this error message when I tried to export the file. I would gladly buy it somewhere
  (don't know where to find it as a purchase font, but even then, I don't know if
  it will embed.)\r\nCould  there be something I'm doing that prevents if from embedding?\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKR Floral Color Me 2 :   This font could not be embedded due
  to licensing restrictioins in the font. A substitute font will be used if it supports
  the glyphs unsed in the restricted font. The PDF will not be created if the glyphs
  cannot be represented. Will not produce a PDF/X compliant file."

  body: "Unusual that a free font has licensing restrictions! Probably InDesign is
    playing it safe because a permission flag is missing. Contact the designer. Or,
    since it's a pi font so you're probably not using it for a lot of \"text\", just
    convert it to outlines.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Not sure how to do that."
