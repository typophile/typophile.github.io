  Sans/PMN Caecilia combination. <em>Casual</em> is the keyword; nothing \"too appealing\",
  \"too distinctive\". Don't think \"display\", think more in the \"handwritten\"
  direction. \r\n\r\nI'm far from being a \"script guy\" \u2026 ideas?\r\n\r\nT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for replying, \r\n\r\nFresco Script is \"too Fresco\" \r\nBrisa is
    too \"wellness hotel\"\r\nErik Righthand is too \"Poster, too black\"\r\n\r\nI
    know script is a highly subjective thing, that's why it might be so difficult
    to find s.th. right \u2013\r\n\r\nOk it's time for a new expanding definition;\r\nA
    handwriting dutch thing with a more informal character.\r\nSomething like Lucida
    Casual in a handwritten style :)\r\n"
