  body: It&#39;s a bit ridiculous to talk about &#39;fonts&#39; when you are looking
    at some sort of metal castings.  The point is that not EVERYTHING is from a computer
    font. There was lettering for hundreds of years without digital fonts, and obviously
    every form of lettering has not been digitized. So much lettering was done by
    hand, and will never be re-created. <BR> <BR>Chris, it would be nice if you would
    give us a break, and post one image at a time per thread, and try to consider
    whether asking about a &#39;font&#39; for manufactured lettering is a reasonable
    request. <BR> <BR>Can I ask what your reason is for these shotgun style ID requests?

    hour? You&#39;d learn a lot more about type and lettering that way. <BR>Asking
    a forum on the web is faster, true, but the time you save is the difference between
    real knowledge and trivia.

  body: I have been looking through typeface sample books and have identified around
    30 typefaces using this method. The reason for the use of the forum is that there
    is a greater wealth of knowledge than a few books can provide.  <BR> <BR>People
    bring their own experiences, influences etc in the identification of a specific
    typeface which then leads me back to typeface specimen books. I am not loosing
    out on using a forum I am infact learning more.

  body: Hi Chris, sorry about the tenseness of some replies. We&#39;ve  <BR>experienced
    an exponential growth since 2003, and since  <BR>the MyFonts forums closed down
    a couple of months ago  <BR>traffic increased even more. Add to this the Board
    software  <BR>which behaves erratically and which ate two year&#39;s worth of  <BR>archives
    we used to rely on as reference material plus recent  <BR>postings with multiple
    IDs per thread... it tends to get a bit much. <BR> <BR>Also, your identification
    request might annoyed some of us  <BR>as obviously it&#39;s quite unrealistic
    to expect them to be matched  <BR>with typefaces. Lettering on metal pipes, stone
    engraving,  <BR>traffic signs and so on all use custom made character sets  <BR>that
    are specifically produced for the medium they&#39;re intended  <BR>for. The medium
    and technical restrictions determine the shapes, <BR>so it&#39;s very hard to
    come up with equivalents in type. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not saying this to justify
    some of the above &#40;over&#41;reactions;  <BR>I only want to put them into context.

  body: OK people, I&#39;ve sent private e-mails to both Chris and Mike as the  <BR>situation
    threatened got out of hand. Let&#39;s get one thing straight.  <BR>You already
    might&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m taking a more pro-active  <BR>stance in policing
    this Board. This means I <i>will not</i> tolerate childish  <BR>nor rude behaviour,
    but also that I expect everyone to be courteous,  <BR>even when dealing with what
    some of us might perceive as  <BR>unrealistic ID requests. Nobody <i>forces</i>
    anyone to contribute, so  <BR>if you feel the conversation is about to turn sour,
    I&#39;d rather you  <BR>simply abstain from posting, unless it&#39;s really waranted.
    <BR> <BR>In this particular instance I feel Mike and maybe Christopher as  <BR>well
    overreacted a bit, as nothing in the original post seemed  <BR>abusive to me.
    I can understand their reaction, but I don&#39;t agree. <BR> <BR>As for Chris,
    you&#39;re getting a second chance, don&#39;t expect to get  <BR>a third. <BR>
    <BR>Case closed.

  body: Yves - There are a few issues that seem to come up repeatedly - ie multiple
    IDs in one request, requests without samples linked or attached, requests for
    freebies, attachments in the wrong format, and &#40;this one really bugs me&#41;
    threads titled &#34;Please help!&#34;  or &#34;Can you ID this font?&#34; instead
    of referring to the content. I&#39;m sure there are other issues I&#39;m forgetting.
    My point is, is there a way in the site header to try to make these points in
    a slightly more emphatic way - or at least to direct newbies to the FAQ before
    they go ahead and post?

    Also, I can confer with Joe&#39;n&#39;Jared to see what&#39;s  <BR>possible with

    inputting a generic <BR>topic title, mass porn spamming if the attachments aren&#39;t

    border=0>  <BR> <BR>Chris, Franz is right, and your argumentation is totally front
    to back. <BR>On a forum entitled Type Identification Board, identifying type and  <BR>helping
    people is <i>ALL WE DO</i>, so naming the threads &#34;Please help!&#34;  <BR>or
    &#34;Can you ID this font?&#34; seems pretty superfluous, don&#39;t you think?
    <BR> <BR>Furthermore, please keep in mind that we already helped you  <BR>several
    times. <i>Nobody&#39;s</i> getting paid for this, and -- apart from the  <BR>little
    slips, granted -- everybody&#39;s been very forthcoming, so chill... <BR>We might
    bitch and moan, but you had your faces identified, innit?
