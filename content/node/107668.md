    the serifs are rounded."

  body: "There are some Garamond's with rounded serifs. Here is Garamond Classico
    Bold (Linotype) at 80% width:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GaramondClassicoBoldWidth80Pct_6695.jpg]\r\nWith
    some editing, particularly R and A, this might serve as an approximate match."

  body: To me, they probably started with a Garamond Condensed (Bold or not) and manually
    emboldened and rounded it by adding an outline stroke, possibly explaining the
    /A rounded top...

  body: "Couldn't get this procedure  to work.\r\nThe only way I can see is to do
    it by hand. Here is Scangraphic's Garamond No. 2 Condensed Medium, original shown
    in black, rounded in red:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GaramondNo2CondensedMedSB_6247.jpg]\r\nTime
    consuming. Either they put some effort in the logo, or used another font.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks guys, I think I can safely assume this is something custom or not digitalised
    then.
