body: "I am doing some research into what makes a font good, in a technical and somewhat
  aesthetic sense. Stuff I am looking for is akin to Leslie Cabarga\u2019s explanations
  of well-drawn letters in <em>The Logo, Font, and Lettering Bible</em> and Bringhurt\u2019s
  explanations of good kerning in <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>. When
  I am researching this stuff I tend to turn up a whole lot of articles lamenting
  the collapse of the typesetting industry and reviews of specific fonts, but outside
  of what is contained in the popular design and typography textbooks, I am not finding
  much that would help designers recognize good fonts on their own. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any suggestions for good research directions or specific articles I can read
  on the subject?"

  body: "Paul, I have a lot of that stuff\u2014and thus another problem. Much of what
    I turn up is geared toward type designers, typophiles, and typomaniacs, thus it
    dwells on esoterica. My task is to create an oral presentation geared to a more
    general audience, something akin to the NYT article on Clearview, but without
    being so specific. Perhaps I should just focus on boiling the esoterica down into
    something people who don\u2019t care so much can understand..."

  body: "do some original research. put together a small questionnaire send it to
    people you trust will give you good, solid answers. maybe ask someone at TDC what
    qualities they look for when giving out their award. Ask some prestigious foundries
    what they look for in typeface submissions. Ask some folks at Adobe and Microsoft
    and some of the larger foundries what type of quality assurance tests their faces
    must pass... &c.\r\n\r\nPut together some of your own thoughts on the subject,
    i'm sure you have some valid opinions on these things."
