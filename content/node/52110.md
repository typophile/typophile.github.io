  body: "to be totally frank here: I think you're over-working it.\r\n\r\nI think
    the whole 'dimensional and shiny' think really detracts from your mark, as does
    the tag-line.\r\n\r\nWhat about a slightly bigger logo (probably 1.5 the height
    of the text) and just like this:\r\n\r\nBlack outline, solid blue fill, and the
    worm either as it is, or as a white silhouette\r\n\r\nand for the text, don't
    do the highlight because it's just detracting from legibility.  try a solid black,
    and a solid blue.\r\n\r\nNow, on a logical standpoint, I believe the <em>com</em>
    owns the period, not the <em>sworms</em>.  (black)sworms(blue begins).com\r\n\r\nNext,
    the first thing I noticed with your tagline was that it read like this to me:
    <em>Community of creaming</em>.  I'm not sure what kind of community this is,
    but softening the <em>s</em> and the <em>worms</em> made me just skip them entirely.\r\n\r\nI
    don't find that the font of the tagline matches the font of the signature, but
    when you do update it, what if the entire tagline was blue (to make it less dominant
    than the signature)\r\n\r\nI'd like to see an updated version with these changes
    at least, there's certainly a lot more than could be done with it and it <em>does</em>
    have potential, but you've gotta be open-minded and trust us here - this is what
    we're passionate about and we wouldn't misguide you.\r\n\r\nbest of luck!"

  body: on second thought, just the blue shape without the black outline, and a white
    silhouette worm might be even stronger than with the black outline - certainly
    cleaner, try a version like that too and see what you think!

    think this portrays your concept a bit better. You still have the worm, but since
    your site is all about \"discussion,\" I've made the \"o\" character double as
    a speech bubble, which the worm is positioned right under.\r\n\r\nIt's simple,
    clean and overall, looks a lot better in my opinion. If you'd like to use it,
    we'll talk."
