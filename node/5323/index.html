  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">last night i was sitting with my pal, talking about all kinda things and sketching together, and i said to him - 'isnt it wierd that typographers i know are apathic about graffiti? because me personaly, i think graffiti is a peak in typography and caligraphy's history. people all around the world are exploring letters in amazingly innovative ways, and its an artform of the masses.. so men and women of all ages, and all sorts of social backgrounds, are writing. i know that when i think of a typography utopia.. its something very much like whats going on in graffiti today. and even though sometimes graffiti is very diffrent from type, it remains an incredibly exciting thing - its a movement of more-or-less neo-typographers and calligraphy masters. if i was a type designer, i think it would make very happy to know that in my area kids are working hard to improve their letters. more so, to know that great calligraphers live and work in my lifetime'. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what do you guys think about graffiti? do you see it as something thats a part of the history of typography or calligraphy? do you write graffiti?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">nick, i found the diffrence between calligraphy and graffiti quite non-existing on several occasions. most of the time i find the two mixing into each other. if you write in someone's sketchbook, for example, thats both calligraphy and graffiti, its a point were the two meet and blend into each other. most of the time i just see my typographic experiments leaking and mixing with my graffiti sketchs, or vice-versa, until i cant tell which is which. its true that graffiti uses diffrent tool then calligraphy.. thus forcing you to use your whole arm. but even though the technique's an importent thing to learn its not the real issue. the really importent thing is how you write, how beautiful and original are your letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bj, i havnt read that book. does it have pictures of ESPO's (aka Stephen Powers) work inside?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he's considered by many a lousy writer because he only did blockbusters, no bombing or complex pieces. his work is plainly typographic in comparison to the general nyc graffiti trends and traditions.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I appreciate your skepticism, it helps to decvelop this conversation further. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you raise some good points, first of all, your correct graffiti is not typography, not yet, at least in any quality form. It is absolutely a form of contemporary calligraphy however. A very established and probably much more practiced form than most traditional calligraphy styles today. And within this world of contemporary graffiti (which is less than 50 years old) different cities (in the states) established different styles. Most writers within a city will have a similiar style ie) my reference to blackletter earlier. This is what intrigues me, the developments of scripts that have geographical characteristics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for point A) peoples familiarity and expectations: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most graffiti writers are primarily writing their nicknames (a nom de plume) which is usually a 4-6 letter word or acronym or just a rediculous group of letters that the artist thinks look good together. It's not always a pop cultural reference, which means that there is not always an in to deciphering it based on hip hop lingo. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Conversely, it's easy to be innovative when you don't have to be legible &ndash; and that devalues the quality of innovation.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is a very good point, however I think that there is room for an evolution in craft, and applying the rules developed for modernist typography is hardly fair to apply to art forms developing independent of that. There are certainly great things to take from the modernist or classicists but in this case I find that these traditions can be limiting, and the new forms worth pursuing . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been looking to the development of type based upon calligraphy, to draw corelations. I have been reading Tracy, Chappel, and Bringhurst, and found a good book called Calligraphic Type Design in the Digital Age, which focus' on Zapf. If anyone has any suggestions of authors who look at the development of typography from a calligraphic standpoint, please share. I'd greatly appraciate it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->C</div>

Its the free play in scale and dimension that makes it hard to look at it in a similiar light as historic calligraphy, but when they are measured and rythmic on purpose, it creates a new thing, a hybrid of graffiti and calligraphy.
