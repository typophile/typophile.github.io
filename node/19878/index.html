<div class=commentbody>My handwriting downright sucks! It is unreadable to anyone but me. Once upon a time I was a decent caligrapher though. It didn't rub off on my handwriting which continues to deteriorate as I age. A few years ago I took a stab at doing a typeface based on my handwriting. In order to make it readable I had to make many changes. It read reasonably well after much revision but I would not use it as a writing model for school kids by any means.

<div class=commentbody>Because handwriting today is not for public use. Everything we do for others we type, therefore, there is no need for neatness. The further I went through school and work, the faster I had to write taking notes or whatever. Speed kills. The other end of it is that perhaps type design, in some way, makes up for this difficiency--kinda like the Napoleon complex.

<div class=commentbody>FYI -- Not all designers have poor penmanship.
<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/mistral/ target=new>Mistral</a>, by Roger Excoffon, 1953
<em>"Mistral is a loose running script based directly on the handwriting of its designer, Roger Excoffon. His goal was to create a typeface with a true handwritten style, but in this case, the writing looks as though it were done with a brush or heavy felt tip."</em>

<div class=commentbody>> "based directly on the handwriting of its designer"
It would be more accurate to say "on <strong>a</strong> handwriting of its designer", since
the development of Mistral involved like a dozen distinct possible styles.

<div class=commentbody>Inlcude me among the type designers with lousy handwriting. In my case, it is largely due to not being taught the correct way to hold a pen at my first school. I briefly went to a school that included penmanship in the curriculum, when I was nine, but by then the damage was done and despite a number of efforts I have never been able to get used to holding a pen correctly and writing with my arm rather than with my fingers.</div>

ChrisL: Where are your fonts available? I'm a big fan of Now Sans (and now Chrishand).
An aside question: What was the first typeface that you can remember imitating in your handwriting/lettering?
For me, it was University Roman (it was the '80s, after all...)

<div class=commentbody>My handwriting is horrendous is most situations where speed is required. I'm also a lefty, which contributes. I've taken to writing in small caps to keep my letterforms distinct. If I don't, my handwriting would become like my mother's which is one step away from looking like seismographic charting. However, if I can slow myself slightly and write on a surface like a notepad, my writing quickly shapes up.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If my handwriting were ever digitized it would have to be Open Type because there is very little rhyme or reason to which letters I connect up. Sort of a roman/cursive hybrid. Just trying to be different I guess... but it was always important to me that my handwriting be both good and distinctive because my mom's is. Altho mine looks nothing like hers.

<div class=commentbody>If I see this about 95% of the typedesigners have a lousy handwriting (incl. me). The alphabet is based on the handwriting, so this thread is a compliment to most type designers. They are able to make good fonts without having a good handwriting themselves.
I think the guys from Underware must have a very good handwriting. In there fonts you practically see the handwriting. (Have a look at the Typeradio.org-banner on the upper right side of this website.)

<div class=commentbody>My writing varies depending on the pen.
The Handsome face (next to bottom) was actually "written" in Fontographer with a Wacom stylus. Handsome Pro (bottom) gets a bit more pseudo-spontaneity, with OpenType contextual alternates, but I still have a few more levels to go in mimicking the real thing.

<div class=commentbody>Guys, it's no use writing a sample for this thread - it has to be done spontaneously.
Further to this: a while ago it hit me that to make typography feel like handwriting, it's not enough to make things irregular, it's not even enough to make things contextual; you need to reproduce the most basic element of handwriting: mistakes! Bad spelling, crossed-out stuff, messy linebreaks, the works. It probably can't even be done by a font. Except maybe by Amy!

Or you could instead say that it's simply a result of
"the alphabet is based on handwriting" being false.

ah yes, my next project. ;)
despite the magic of opentype, i'd argue that handwriting fonts simply can't do what handwriting does...basically, handwriting fonts are simulacrum of handwriting.
if we look to graphology, the best way to get a sample of someone's handwriting is to take it from something previously written, to really capture the unconscious forms that occur when we're taken off guard. </div>

The thing is, OpenType scripts have concentrated on capturing the beauty of formal calligraphy.
If the same amount of genius that went into Zapfino Extra Pro or Caflisch Pro were to be put into mimicing "ordinary" writing, then we'd see some different results. A few people have done "first generation" attempts, such as myself and Christian (Dear Sarah), but there are subsequent generations of OT scripts to come that will be truly scary in their ability to fool the Turing Testees.</div>

I actually think that the need to have variant glyphs (at least beyond 3 or 4 = the range of the fovea) is over-rated; I don't think our short-term memory of specific letter shapes survives across fixations. On the other hand, to repeat, a bigger factor is the overall texture of a setting: it would be very hard to give it a convincing divergence.

<div class=commentbody>I think our handwriting skills depends of how much we actually use it. When I was a kid, in the hand-writing classes in school, my teachers didn't know what to give me for homework since I easily completed the basic hand-writing-methods. It came very natural to me during those early years in life, and I really loved it.
But today... haha forget about it! I never use it – so when I once a year try to write something, it looks really terrible.
Same with art/drawing classes, I got a really good grade in it, but today I can only produce illustrations with the help of Adobe Illustrator.
I guess I am "vectorified" for life.</div>

Let me share an insight concerning a common word possessing uncommon rhetorical magic: "really". Formally it's supposed to <cite>reinforce</cite> things, but in practice it can actually throw a wrench in the absolutism, and nobody can complain. Add it to a statement that needs diluting but you don't want to dilute, and it will save the day. And if it's too late, just add something like "Not really." immediately after the offending statement, stand back, and admire the rhetorical alchemy.
So for example: "Nobody really writes any more."
Or: "Nobody writes any more. Not really."

BTW, here's a sample of some of the best

<div class=commentbody>Here's my two cents:
My father for all I knew when I was a kid always printed in all caps. He is an engineer and had spent so much time doing technical drawings by hand, that well, it came naturally and was necessary.
Skip to another subject entirely: Christmas. We would get these elaborately wrapped presents in crazy-coloured tissue paper with scrawls all over them, signed from Santa. It took several years -- long after I stopped believing in Santa -- for me to realize it was my father's actual cursive handwriting -- I had assumed one of my parents was faking a flourishy handwriting. But there was a real reason he never ever wrote in cursive.... (He occasionally performs the same task for my kids because my handwriting, no matter how badly I scrawl, is still recognizable as mine.)

<div class=commentbody>Hehe. Yes, he did. My kids' Santa occasionally dabbles in French, though. You *can* teach an old dog new tricks!
It'd be interesting to revisit my dad's printing, especially what he actually wrote on the plans/drawings. I remember finding it extraordinarily even and consistent.

<div class=commentbody>My handwriting's unjustifiable, but my calligraphy is good, and I imagine that's the case for quite a few type designers. Good type isn't chirographic, but once you know your arm and your wrist and your fingers and your pen ($10 from a discount store I travel 200 miles to visit) <em>neither is good calligraphy</em>.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>It's not chirographic in the sense that it doesn't lead to the geometric relationship between exterior and interior outlines which one sees in reductively chirographic type. For one thing, of course, pen nibs are 3D objects rather than 2D moving fronts. More important is that the nib can - and in hardcore calligraphy, as opposed to Get Well Soon calligraphy, will - be rotated slightly, pressure will vary greatly, and angle from page as baseline to pen will vary to an extent depending on the degree of rasping roughness that one wants to get out of it. That the imperatives of the muscles and the visual system working together will also make straights and curves far from straight or simply bezier-ish also counteracts the perceiving eye's readiness to chunk away a form as merely the expression of a geometry.
That black occupies less area than white in most calligraphy does not in itself make the calligraphy less notanic. (Is that the accepted adjective?)</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>OK I got you all beat here.
I destroyed my handwriting in HS when I had to 'write pages' as punishment.
So I adopted a scribble style that is barely legible, but just readable enough to pass as writing.
+6 months I can't figure my own handwriting. Worse, I don't really care about spelling anymore as long as I get the idea on the paper. Sometime as long as I think i have most of the word down, I'll just wobble the rest off. Kind of a shorthand.
In addition I change my mind all the time about how I draw out a letter , look at the word 'each' (top right) I used 2 different lowercase 'a's for the same word. Sometimes I switch to ALL CAPS IN THE MIDDE OF A SENTENCE FOR NO REASON. My wife is watching me closely for other signs of schizophrenia.
I guess I look at type in 2 forms 1. Communication 2.Design. I've perfectly designed many misspelled words in my time. Cients LOVE it.
Well I'll let you be the judge:
P.S. The only reason this is spelled right is because I used spell check. In the original version I got punnishment wrong as well as ledgible. Also schitophrenia in the edit.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HndWrtng_5626.jpg]
LOL I forgot my handwriting is PERFECT for writing down a 'hot work' contacts email addy at a party. I wonder why they think I never email them??</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sl-sample_4080.jpg]
I love handwriting, and I think it's a shame the nature of our modern lives means we can't use it more than we do. I always loved reading about the work of handwriting analysts and discovering what they could tell about a person from their handwriting.
Although I've never had great handwriting, as a fiercely proud left-hander I've always taken great pride in each and every smudge across my page. Primary school teachers tried to get me to hold the pen "properly" but I never listened. Although now my hand curls around from above so much that I'm almost a pseudo-right-hander. :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Patricia - Oh yes, I missed that one. Do you have a preference for uppercase, or do you find you just use it when you need to? I wonder why we prefer one to the other? When I was a teenager I spent far, far too many hours searching for the style of signature that would capture the very essence of my being (important task, no?), and for a while I had an uppercase version that I liked. Can't remember why it fell into disfavour. Redoing it now, I kind of like it more than what I eventually settled on. :-)
