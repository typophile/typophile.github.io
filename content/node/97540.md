body: "Hi all. Here we go again.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface suggestion for
  logo/corporate-identity for a program that helps institutions in developing countries
  improve their ability to train/educate their agronomists and agricultural professionals.\r\n\r\nAnd
  if that aint enough, the customer likes Century Gothic. So I'm looking for geometrically-round
  (optically-corrected) /o/ and single-story /a/, with an option for an /i/ with a
  circular dot. True small caps would be a big plus.\r\n\r\nSome adjectives: modernizing,
  innovating, professional education, higher education, agriculture, organic.\r\n\r\nI
  came up dry, on my own. That's why I'm back to the well! Thanks, in advance, for
  your insights/suggestions."

    strategies with the host-country institutions, but they're nowhere near that savvy
    about their visual identity."

    to me very much at odds with professional and higher education environments."

  body: "That's a very wide spectrum of countries so I have to concede that it would
    be better to standardize. But Karl is right, and I'd add that a monocular \"a\"
    seriously reduces readability (assuming you'll use the font for a decent amount
    of text).\r\n\r\nMy main question now is: do they want to look like they're a
    bringing solution from outside (specifically the West) or do they want to appear
    more sensitive to local cultures? If it's the latter that's one more srtike against
    something like Century Gothic.\r\n\r\nIt's always hard to convince a client that
    their personal visual taste might be detrimental to the objective at hand, but
    intelligent clients can handle it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'll have leeway on the single-storey /a/, at the end of the day. But this
    will almost certainly NOT be used for web-text or print-body-text, in any way/shape/form.
    So, dump the /a/ requirement. And a square-dot on the /i/ can always be replaced
    with a circle, if it gets used for a logo.\r\n\r\nI use Relay personally. I like
    how it looks back on Metro and art deco without being too obvious. I'm a little
    concerned about using it for this though: this should look forward.\r\n\r\nCentury
    Gothic screams \"the West,\" eh? If so, that's indeed another strike. Agronomists
    and educators in our Host Countries (i.e., the non-US-countries listed) should
    see it and say \"yes, they help us make our institutions better, I want to use
    them again.\" Sensitivity to local culture is, in theory at least, baked into
    everything this organization does."

    to make them the same height as the /n/n/o/v/ ...the /o/v/ will have ambiguity
    as to whether they're cap or miniscule... the dot on the /i/ will be the only
    thing outside the \"box\" of the bodies of the letters. I'll try the /A/T/E/ in
    a different color because it stands for \"Agricultural Training and Education.\"
    (Where \"innov\" stands for \"Innovation for...\")\r\n\r\nSomething with enough
    personality that it stands out.\r\n\r\nBah, just do your best. Obviously, I'm
    interested in your thoughts on this problem."

    yes, quite anti-geometric (even if it involves genetically-modified foods :-).
    Maybe something with no straight lines (which makes me think of Bloemsma's work,
    yet again). And/or if the tittle will indeed be standing out, maybe make it the
    focus of the agro factor; the obvious thing would be making it look like a seed
    or a sprout, or a droplet.\r\n\r\nTake a look at Panoptica too.\r\n\r\nBTW what

  body: "I looked at H&FJ's whole library. Archer almost made it for me, but I was
    concerned that the slab serif would have old-timey connotations for some. Whitney
    really sent me. But ultimately, the subtle beauty of it was going to be lost on
    the customer. \"It just looks like you typed out the word.\" So, with sadness,
    I dumped that line of inquiry.\r\n\r\nYour Hess Gothic Round is gorgeous, Nick.
    If they insist on looking like an industrialized, imperialistic Western Power
    -- but friendlier! -- I'll steer that way.\r\n\r\nI've tried an Avance treatment,
    still in draft form. I really like how the letters have a bit of an unfamiliar
    look to me (a Westerner thru and thru), but the serifs seem to drive the motion
    forward. Good, subtle symbolism in a face that's not ostentatious, but not \"plain.\"
    We'll see how it flies."
