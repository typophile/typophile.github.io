body: "The example I'm trying to learn FontForge with is a very simplistic font, not
  the actual font I want to create. I figured it is best to try to learn with something
  with extremely simplistic glyphs. So no need to critique this font itself, it's
  just practice and learning.\r\n\r\nHere is the concept that I am attempting to learn
  with:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg611/AliceWonder32/AlicePC_zps24ac0ba5.png\"
  width=\"600\">\r\n\r\nI created an SVG file that is 1000 x 1000 with the ascender
  guide at y=200, decender guide at y=800, baseline at y=684, x height guide at y=287.
  For this practice font, ascender and cap height are the same (as they are with,
  say, Helvetica)\r\n\r\nPNG rendition of my Letter A imposed over the guide:\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg611/AliceWonder32/template_zps800eff5d.png\"
  width=\"600\">\r\n\r\nThe SVG path to create the A -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;path d=\"M340.5,664\r\n
  \        l              0      -435\r\n         l             29       -29\r\n         l
  \           290         0\r\n         l              0       464\r\n         l            -72.5
  \      0\r\n         l              0   -239.25\r\n         l           -174         0\r\n
  \        l              0    239.25\r\n         l            -72.5       0\r\n         \"/&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe
  result of importing it into fontforge:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i1246.photobucket.com/albums/gg611/AliceWonder32/ScreenshotA_zps914a3ed2.png\">\r\n\r\nIs
  that correct? It seems that fontforge doesn't know what my baseline is or my cap
  height, and I guess that makes sense because there is nothing in the SVG to specify
  that. Is there someplace in fontforge where I can specify the baseline, x-height,
  and cap-height?\r\n\r\nLooking at the fontforge import, it does Y coordinates reverse
  from SVG and it looks like it would have the baseline at 140, possibly 136 (which
  would be 800 - my SVG baseline of 664)\r\n\r\nTo do the least amount of work after
  import, should I use SVG coordinates of y=800 for my baseline or is that something
  I can configure in FontForge?\r\n\r\nThank you for any tips."

  body: "OK - it does look like I need to set the baseline at y=800 in the SVG file
    and it looks like the initial M command in an SVG path, assuming that I start
    drawing the glyph in the left most position, should be left side bearing.\r\n\r\nI
    have to read more about left side bearing, I always assumed spacing between letters
    was done a different way, I guess the left and right side bearing are initial
    spacing before justification?\r\n\r\nI need to read more about that.\r\n\r\nAnd
    it looks like the width of the SVG file needs to be left-side-bearing + bounding
    box width + right side bearing.\r\n\r\nI'm still trying to figure out how to get
    the ascender and descender properly identified by FontForge."

  body: I could perhaps just use y=0 in the SVG as the ascender guide, but I have
    seen some fonts where for whatever reason a few glyphs do stretch slightly above
    or below what is clearly the ascender or descender line, so I'm not sure I want
    y=0 as the ascender. I guess that's probably not the end of the world to have
    part of a curve cross y=0 in the SVG, but I'd prefer not to.

  body: "Clearly there's something I'm not understanding.\r\n\r\nPlaying with various
    fonts, choosing a size so the baseline is 800 units below the ascender, the decender
    is usually more than 200 units below the baseline.\r\n\r\nSo there must be some
    way of letting fontforge know what the ascender, baseline, and decender lines
    are in a SVG that is 1000 units in height."

  body: "Sorry to ramble on but what would be nice is if I could always set my ascender
    at y=20 and decender at y=980 and then set the baseline, xheight, and cap-height
    somewhere in-between.\r\n\r\nThat would allow all my glyphs to have a bounding
    box within 1000 x 1000 even if a glyph or two has legitimate need to exceed the
    ascender/decender a tad.\r\n\r\nSome kind of xml metadata tag in the SVG file
    to define where the ascender,decender, and baseline are to fontforge on import
    would be in my mind the easiest way to do that."

  body: "I think you may need more info about ascender and descender settings. Hint:
    descender is always a negative number in normal fonts.\r\n\r\nThere is an image
    here [[http://fontforge.org/overview.html | FontForge Documentation]] that should
    give you a lot of insight on Baseline, Ascender and Descender.\r\n\r\nOther than
    that, read all of the FontForge documentation, or find a good book or website
    on the subject, such as this one [[http://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/22/so-you-want-to-create-a-font-part-1/

  body: "On the side, why are you creating your initial outlines in an SVG file?\r\n\r\nOf
    course, sometimes you will have outlines in some other format and need to bring
    them into your font editor. But if that's not the case, and you are drawing them
    from scratch right now, you may have a MUCH easier time of it drawing the outlines
    in your font editor instead. Just a thought!"
