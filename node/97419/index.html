But you don't have to go with a crazy-expressive type. Try this:

And I would lose the bubbles. A nice beaker (better than that one) would be plenty.

I agree with hrant that you should change the font. Helvetica looks dated & corporate.</div>

I get the concept, but it isn't clever enough for me to go past a one-to-one understanding of it. In other words, it is called 'beaker' and you have an image of a beaker. Too obvious perhaps? Could the beaker also contain some imagery that suggested media? I am thinking hip and clever, not corny.</div>

Replacing a letter with a similarly shaped object is often too obvious and not a compelling solution. Try some brainstorming strategies and get inspired and creative. It is worth it.  One thing that pops out to me is the similarity between the graduations on a beaker and many media related things (sprocket holes, timelines, music score, pixel grid, etc.) Here are some possible sources of inspiration:

Generally I prefer simplicity in a logo, but the beaker area looked dull and it was a suggestion off the top of my head. It's more visually interesting now, although it now has details that won't hold up in small sizes. 

To be honest, when I'm designing a logo, most of the ideas I have don't pan out. That's the nature of the process. You try lots of things, reject most of them, refine some, tear out your hair, and days/weeks later you finally come up with something good. Maybe.</div>

1) Thanks for the input! I am listening Mr. FontMan Lol

2) The beaker- Ok now you think the beaker has too much detail? is it the highlights or the liquid that is filling it? I see what you mean though if we made the image smaller the detail would get lost. 

3) The Font- I will try other fonts but I'm trying to figure out if Handwriting or the thicker font's look best. I will probably end up trying to find a similar one on Dafonts or something like that

4) Imagery- I thought the beaker as the A was cool...no? I see the examples you gave and a suggestion would be to put the beaker at the beginning but I'm having a hard time (no matter where the dern beaker goes) finding away to connect media in the theme.

		<div class="commentbody">Try to avoid Dafont - it's 99% crap (and that's a conservative estimate). The few dollars you save will cost you later, not least in terms of conveying an inferior image of your company. You can easily find an affordable font that does the job right; you might even find something you can also use for setting text, not just the logo.

I personally think the "A" as a beaker works. But nice beakers aren't all straight lines - they're straight lines joined by soft curves.
http://eventcamptwincities.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/beaker_icon-007.png
Find a font like that, and when you replace the "A" with a nice beaker it'll click just right.

Having liquid in the beaker: if you can make the water line express the horizontal bar of an "A" that would be great.

		<div class="commentbody">Ashley some details in the beakers (especially the bubble reflections) are way too small. Reduce the logo to postage-stamp size and see what happens. Elements need to be bold enough that they'll still be visible when the logo is small (like on a business card, small web ad, etc.).

Regarding the font, I'm glad that you're trying alternatives, but I almost feel like you're shooting in the dark. You might want to consider bringing in an outside graphic designer to help out. If you find a local one maybe you can barter a trade of services or something if the budget is tight.</div>

What part of this logo, to you, says 'hip'?

As it is, it feels very literal, which isn't maybe the 'hip' you were going after. 

As others have stated, the use of a beaker/lab is nothing new in this industry, either. That may or may not be a concern. 

I think attempts at separating the icon from the wordmark are a good idea, but I"m not seeing much thought put into the typeface choices. Seems random, at best. </div>

Think about how many great things throughout history started in a beaker. Beaker1Media is a Multi-Media Production Company started by a group of talented, bored, under-utilized young people. We are big thinkers and go-getters. From video to graphics, from photography, to social media, we have a specialist on board, poised to help you create something great!

		<div class="commentbody">OK, so maybe you need to really embrace the beaker idea with this project. Go back to your basic ingredients, experiment, mix it up. Big thinkers and go-getters should be great at this. Ideas are your lab kit. It is your opportunity to show off how creative and great your process can be. I still don't know why it is not Beaker 2 or Beaker 42, or why not just beaker. Really define what you want people to think when they experience your branding: fun or serious, youthful or experienced, edgy or reliable, flashy or subtle, emotional or rational, etc. Get in the lab with those carefully considered ingredients and start experimenting with keywords, imagery, type styles, word mapping, free association, doodles, photos, mood boards, and any other strategy that you can come up with to generate some material to manipulate and evaluate. This is the ideation phase of the experiment. The goal is to get as many different ideas as you can, and not care if they are refined or look good at all. It will take a good amount of work and lots of unusable ideas, but you will end up with some good ideas, and a strong basis for execution. Then you can turn on the computer.</div>

If they are decorations, do you think the logo still works if these are removed?

Have a look through these - http://www.identityworks.com/reviews/index.htm - and try and see what they've got in common, and why none of your options would be a good fit for the list. Once you figure that out, try and sketch something that would compare favorably to the linked list, and then go from there.

		<div class="commentbody">It still seems like you are trying to combine a beaker with the number 1 but without a really good reason to do so in terms of the message this sends. It could work if the message is largely conveyed by a highly refined execution. In other words, it would be an example of the quality of your illustration skills. Lacking either a smart concept or a compelling execution, it doesn't become a strong enough brand mark. Here is my quick take on what a solid execution might look like: Beaker graduations + number 1 + Negative space B =
