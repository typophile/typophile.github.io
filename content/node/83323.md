body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've been wondering where the term 'Dingbats' came from. I
  know that earlier (BC - Before Computers) the technical term was printers ornament.
  What called for this sudden and well, abrupt jump? Any clues?"

  body: I'm fairly sure it started with Zapf Dingbats, as the whimsical name ITC chose
    for the font. The word "dingbat" was originally one of those words for arbitrary
    unnamed objects like "doohickey" and "thingamabob".

  body: The OED says that the term entered the English Language in the mid-1800s,
    source uncertain, to describe a miscellany of objects in general. The OED further
    states that the term was applied to a miscellany of type in the early Twentieth
    Century.
