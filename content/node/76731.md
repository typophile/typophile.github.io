body: "I was recently contacted by an art director working for \"Promotion and Branding\"
  at TOYA, in Poland.\r\n\r\nThey bought the entire family of \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax
  Pro]] and needed certain Polish glyphs for a TOYA brochure they were creating.\r\n\r\nIn
  order to accommodate them, I got busy creating all the accented characters they
  required and then just decided to do them all.\r\n\r\nIt took a while, but I have
  just now updated all 18 \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax
  Pro]] weights and styles with a full compliment of \"Eastern European\" character
  sets.\r\n\r\nEwa Kowalczyk was kind enough to sent me a PDF of the final brochure
  they created using \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax
  Pro]], which I am happy to share with everyone here at the \"Type Forum\".\r\n\r\nIt
  is indeed rewarding to see your fonts being used.\r\n\r\nEwa said everyone involved
  with the project was delighted with the new look and feel of the brochure, which
  has a fresh, clean and modern look to it.\r\n\r\nI agree. Thank you Ewa."
