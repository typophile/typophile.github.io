  body: "Wow.\r\nThis is quite delicious.\r\n\r\n> 8 Hours each glyphs.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a bit uncanny that this seems to be a sort of\r\nmagic number. The punchcutters
    of yesteryear\r\nused to average about 8 hours per character, and\r\nwhenever
    I get serious about doing my best that's\r\nthe number I arrive at myself! This
    has been true\r\nwhether I've made outline or (grayscale) pixelfonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
