Google&#39;s your friend? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#34;robofog&#34; gets just relevant hits in Google, the third being Just van Rossum&#39;s and Erik van Blokland&#39;s page:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.letterror.com/code/old/robofog/" target="_blank">http://www.letterror.com/code/old/robofog/</a> <BR> <BR>&#34;RoboFog <BR>RoboFog is our own tool for font production. An updated version of Fontographer 3.5 welded on top of the Python programming language makes a scriptable typedesign tool. Designers can program the functionality they need themselves.  <BR> <BR>Development for RoboFog has stopped. The Fontographer code was too old to be ported to OSX. Also the requirements for a good font editor went up. In the mean time we&#39;ve focussed our development effort into RoboFab, a toolkit for scripting and programming with fonts and glyphs, inside and outside of FontLab. &#34; <BR> <BR>The 6th hit:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFog" target="_blank">http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFog</a> <BR> <BR>&#34;RoboFog <BR>RoboFog is a version of Fontographer 3.5 that embeds a Python interpreter. RoboFog was developed by Just van Rossum, Petr van Blokland and Erik van Blokland. It is more or less discontinued, although we fix bugs for those still using it. It&#39;s based on very old source code, and while it has served its purpose well, we&#39;ve reached the limits of what we can do with it. For example it can&#39;t properly support larger character sets, unicode or new font formats. It&#39;s a classic MacOS app and won&#39;t be ported to MacOSX. These days there is FontLab, and for all its quirks, it is much more powerful than RoboFog could ever be. Our RoboFab project should make Python scripting for FontLab more comfortable. &#34; <BR> <BR>Finally, the 4th hit delivers the resolution:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.letterror.com/code/robofab/intro.html" target="_blank">http://www.letterror.com/code/robofab/intro.html</a> <BR> <BR>&#34;RoboFab Intro <BR>RoboFab is a library of Python code for manipulation and storage of font and glyph related data. RoboFab implements a new font file format, the Unified Font Objects or .ufo for short. UFO is a format for font sources &#40;similar to something like .fog or .vfb&#41; except that UFO is XML based &#40;see Glyph Interchange Format&#41;, readable, well documented and easily extended to contain different kinds of data. &#40;...&#41;  <BR> <BR>What RoboFab is not.. <BR>Not entirely RoboFog MkII <BR>RoboFab is not a port of RoboFog to OSX, nor is it a complete font editor with interfaces, font and glyph windows etc. It is a toolkit that you can use to build your tools with. You can start by using RoboFab to make scripting in FontLab easier. But you can also use RoboFab to build elaborate tools &#40;for instance MetricsMachine&#41; that read and write UFO fonts and work on the data. Other RoboFab based tools are under construction. &#34; <BR> <BR>I hope this helps.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Three Italic fonts die together in a bad <BR>book design and go to Typo-Heaven. <BR> <BR>When they get there, St. Peter Karow says, <BR>&#34;We only have one rule here in Typo-Heaven: <BR>Don&#39;t step on the Dutch!&#34; <BR> <BR>So they enter heaven, and sure enough, <BR>there are Dutch all over the place. <BR>It is almost impossible not to step on a Dutch, <BR>and although they try their best to avoid them, <BR>the first Italic accidentally steps on one. <BR> <BR>Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest Roman <BR>she ever saw. St. Peter put them together <BR>in a suitcase and says, &#34;Your punishment <BR>for stepping on a Dutch is to spend eternity <BR>chained to this ugly Roman!&#34; <BR> <BR>The next day, the second Italic steps accidentally <BR>on a Dutch and along comes St. Peter, who doesn&#39;t <BR>miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly Roman. <BR>He chains them together with the same admonishment <BR>as for the first Italic. <BR> <BR>The third Italic has observed all this and, <BR>not wanting to be chained for all eternity <BR>to an ugly Roman, is very, VERY careful where she steps. <BR>She manages to go postscript months without stepping <BR>on any Dutch. <BR> <BR>One day St. Peter comes up to her with the most handsome <BR>Roman she has ever laid eyes on. St. Peter chains them <BR>together without Word. <BR> <BR>The happy Italic says to the Roman, &#34;I wonder what I did <BR>to deserve being chained to you for all eternity?&#34; <BR> <BR>The Roman says, &#34;Well, I don&#39;t know about you, <BR>but I stepped on a Dutch!&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Copyright &#40;c&#41; Alessandro Segalini, 2004. <BR> <BR></div>
