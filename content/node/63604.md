  Slab]] is an extension of the original [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/chennai/|Chennai]].
  Chennai Slab is a simplified slab serif with over sixty OpenType alternates. These
  alternates include alternates for the ball terminals, unique simplified alternates
  and more traditional capital forms. Use Chennai Slab when you need a fun and versatile
  slab serif. The sans-serif Chennai makes a great complement. Six weights are available.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/artwork?id=32257&subdir=original|Sample
