  body: "Not sure why you need to match this, but I scanned through the 300-font Handwritten
    Font ClickArt collection and this wasn't there. Your next best bet is to look
    at Handwritten fonts in the free Dafont.com collection, or skim through Part 11
    of my Script Font ID Guide.  \r\n\r\nOur usual advice is find something similar
    and use that, because this might be a one-off custom font done with someone's
    own printing. You can make fonts like this for almost nothing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
