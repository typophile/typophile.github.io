body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nThe release of my first serious typeface is still too
  far away to start thinking about marketing, but I just want to get a rough idea
  of what I can expect.\r\n\r\n1. What are the ranges of sales figures for a well
  designed commercial font? \r\n2. If you're a typedesigner, how large is the part
  of your income from single weights compared to typefamilies?\r\n3. Do cheap fonts
  sell better? Around where is the market equilibrium?\r\n\r\nHonestly, I have no
  idea at all. Just a rough idea is much appreciated. I know that prices and sales
  can vary hugely, depending on trends, size of Character Set, and the range of weights.
  So, for the sake of clearness, let's say, a well designed humanist sans serif with
  12 styles and a Complete Latin Character Set.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJasper"

    large amount generating a healthy income, whereas others that you'd hope to be
    popular are not and shift hardly any units.\r\n\r\n2. Don't know.\r\n\r\n3. I
    wouldn't go down the cheap route if I were you. From what I've seen of your stuff
    you are producing original non-derivative quality products."

    but in short - experiment with pricing to converge to your optimal routine price
    point, then run periodic sales, deep discount events and special discounts for
    selected customer groups. That''s about it :)'

  body: "Pan-European would include Greek and Cyrillic, rather different than \"Complete
    Latin\" (whatever that might mean).\r\n\r\nThe range of $$ values of sales is
    immense. Fonts are kind of like books or movies in this regard. Most do not make
    enough money to justify the time spent making them. A few give a decent return,
    and a very few are runaway hits and make a fair bit of money.\r\n\r\nBesides pricing
    and font quality, how you distribute and promote the fonts is also very important.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "@james montalbano: No, that's too much. I'm not sure how much languege support
    I'll include to be honest. Is there some kind of market standard for that?\r\nI
    will include Cyrillic and Greek, be it after original release.\r\nFor now: Western
    European, Central European, Blatic, Turkish and Romanian. That's just Basic Latin,
    Latin 1 supplement and Latin Extended A, right?\r\n\r\nThanks guys!"
