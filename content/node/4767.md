body: Hello all, <BR> <BR>Any ideas on these two? The Ghostbusters logo was created
  in 1984. The type seems very familiar but frustratingly I haven&#39;t been able
  to find it. The type is distinctive by the spur on the G. I can&#39;t tell if the
  type below &#40;&#34;collector&#39;s series&#34;&#41; is the same family or different
  typeface altogether &#40;maybe another Norvarese?&#41;. That too is familiar, but
  my eyes or my brain are too tired now. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/silverado-rr/"
  target="_blank">Silverado</a> from Red Rooster seems close &#40;including the spur&#41;,
  but Silverado was created after 1984. RR says Silverado was based on Eldorado, but
  they had to change the name since linotype had a dissimilar type by the same name.
  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-symbol/" target="_blank">ITC
  Symbol</a> is also similar, as is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/memo/"
  target="_blank">Memo</a>, but both don&#39;t have the spur on the G.  <BR> <BR>As
  for the type in used for autamata <i>&#40;another good CD, btw&#41;</i>, I haven&#39;t
  a clue.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35877.jpg"

    in  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/friz-quadrata/friz-quadrata/testdrive.html?s=COLLECTOR%27S%20SERIES&amp;p=48"

    logo. <BR> <BR>&#34;automata&#34; is very close to Mark&#39;s <a href="http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximasans.html"

    target="_blank">ITC Quorum</a>, but like most of my first thoughts, it wasn&#39;t
    right.

    target="_blank">Columna Solid</a> are similar, but, considering when it&#39;s
    from, this may very well have been custom. I scoured my film font books from that
    period and found nothing else that came close.

  body: I checked with Michael C. Gross, one of the associate producers of Ghostbusters
    who also designed the &#34;no ghosts&#34; logo, and he doesn&#39;t remember. He
    said that Columbia Pictures&#39; agency did the type treatment. He also said he
    doesn&#39;t think it was custom. Mystery unsolved.

    Flange</a> was another likely candidate I came up with, together  <BR>with the
    aforementionned ITC Quorum, but no match.

  body: Wow, lots has happened since I was last here. Among the information gleened
    is that Mark is well connected with Hollywood legends <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I believe Mr. Gross is quoted in a Premiere magazine article
    about the 20th anniversary of Ghostbusters, which is what got me looking at  Ghosbusters
    again. Small world, idinit?  Thanks for all the effort Mark, not to mention everyone
    else. Not custom, aye? Mystery unsolved indeed! <BR>

  body: Hmm, well, I just happened to be acquainted with Michael through some odd
    channels &#40;I&#39;m a big fan of his work as art director at <i>National Lampoon</i>
    magazine in the early &#39;70s&#41;. In spite of what he said, I still think it
    most likely that it was custom lettering.

  body: I actually think it might be custom too. Here&#39;s a french movie poster
    &#40;I presume released around that same time&#41; and they used a different but
    similarly styled font &#40;likey one of the ones mentioned above &#40;Flange or
    Quorum?&#41;. The R&#39;s are different from the one in the logo. While not the
    nail in the coffin for a custom logo, it certainly is evidentiary.  <BR> <BR><img
