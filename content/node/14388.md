  when I 'fell over' the 'w' in what would become this character set.\r\n\r\nI remembered
  the way Andrew used negative space in his font \"Pug', even going so far as to split
  the lc characters from their stems in an effort to balance out their color. so i
  tried something like that here.\r\n\r\nit's an interesting little study, for a font
  four pixels high."

    but it should appear as the second attachment in the original post.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the minus family. Such as it is, being so small. I think the unicases
    are kind of fun."

  body: I decided to see if I could extend <A HREF="http://typophile.com/node/7832">Fourmat</A>
    to the entire ASCII character set the other day. I am curious to see what the
    differences and similarities would be if you did the same for Minus.

  body: "isn't it amazing how different two designs can be at only four pixels high?\r\n\r\ni'm
    going to flesh out the minus family a little later. my typical work flow involves
    putting a font down for quite a while sometimes, before coming back to it to try
    and publish it.\r\n\r\ni am usually able to hone the design a little better that
    way."
