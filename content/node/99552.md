body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nHow do I globally shift the baseline position in FL? Currently,
  it seem that when I shift the baseline in a glyphs windows, the change is applied
  only locally to that particular glyph. Also I don't see any option to modify the
  baseline position in the font metrics.\r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: "Technically speaking, the baseline can't be shifted \u2014  notice that even
    when you move it in the glyph window, it stays at 0 and simply shifts the glyph
    itself. You can achieve the same effect on multiple glyphs with <code>Tools >
    Action</code> (the very first one under Contour), or using the Transformation
    panel with the glyphs selected in the Font window. (Note: the Shift command in
    Transformation panel doesn't shift hints or masks, so if your glyphs have either
    of those, use the Action tool.)"

  body: So, let's say I wanna move down each glyph 12 units (when I imported from
    Illustrator the zero point didn't match the baseline in FL), I apply the mentioned
    action and that's all? It will work on diacritics and components as well?
