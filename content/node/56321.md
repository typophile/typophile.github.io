body: "To the great dismay of many, the Typophile.com listing in Wikipedia was removed.\r\n\r\nI
  put it back.\r\n\r\nThe reason it was removed was because the original wasn't good
  enough, and looked like something created by Punchcut, which it probably was.\r\n\r\nSo,
  for the sake of Typophile.com's integrity, I created a new listing. (Actually, I
  created two listings. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typophile| Typophile disambiguation
  page]] and the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typophile_(Internet_Forum)|Typophile
  (Internet Forum)]] page.\r\n\r\nTo prevent any further disruptions, I encourage
  all to cite all relevant <em>external</em> links and citations to the Typophile
  page.\r\n\r\nIf you are a type designer/foundry with their own website, external
  links can be used as sources for a new paragraph listing Typophile.com as a resource
  for type designers and foundries.\r\n\r\nIf you are an opentype font/application
  developer, external links that show Typophile as a resource for that work should
  be listed as a separate paragraph as well.\r\n\r\nWhat would also be helpful is
  a [[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Interwiki_map|full Interwiki integration]]
  with the [[typowiki]] hosted here.\r\n\r\nI'll post further ideas as they happen
  to come to me.\r\n"

    Jedi were spending too much time here instead of independently researching the
    essays.

  body: Sii, is there any official "Microsoft love" that is/can be pointed at Typophile?
    I could find stuff in the archives referencing off hand Typophile, but nothing
    directly about it being a resource for Opentype developers, etc. Could you help
    me find something about that?

    in the font developer resource pages Michelle can add some links.\r\n\r\nWe do
    have plenty of \"news links\" here... \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/\r\n\r\n...type
    \"typophile\" in the search box at the bottom of the page for results.\r\n"

  body: "That was the specific page that I was expecting some sort of direct link,
    but it's obviously not there. A static link, I mean. I know that misc links to
    specific threads float through there regularly.\r\n\r\nWikipedia doesn't like
    links that come from directories, since most directories don't have any sense
    to them and most often do not point to specific web sites as authoritative on
    the relevant subject. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that you have a link referencing
    Typophile from that main links page, a simple one, but a more authoritative recommendation
    on the font developer overview page next to the Opentype List reference, or on
    the Type Developer Links page, that specifically mention Typophile's forums as
    a good place for questions concerning font development, etc."

    on Friday afternoon, just in case it broke the site for the whole weekend... :-)
