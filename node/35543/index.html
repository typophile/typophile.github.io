  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Is it right for a webdesigner to tell the graphic designer to make sure they create a logo that they can slap onto a coloured background for the website? I want opinions because I feel it is not appropriate as I think it looses the logo&rsquo;s quality and its essence and throws the real purpose of it out of the window as the web designer would like it white on his coloured background. Geez, am I in the wrong or he? What are your opinions? Is he being lazy and not wanting to work around the logo on the website and making it harder for me to come up with something for the logo or is he purely right? Thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The logo has to perform in any realistic scenario. Clearly it is going to need to be reversed.</p>
<p>Say, for instance, in the future the company sponsors an event. The event host wants to include all the sponsor logos on the bottom of a brochure. That logo may need to be reversed. It may need to be really small.</p>
<p>It is very common to reverse a mark. I would say that if a mark was designed that couldn&rsquo;t be reversed the designer would have needed to strongly advise the client about the issue before they made their selection.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is usual (essential) that a logo works in many environments, which would include a white out version. If an identity existed before the website then the web designer should take this into account before designing the site. So although he might not be entirely right it is your responsibility take into consideration that most logos will eventually have to work in a less than ideal environment. And viewing it as right and wrong won’t help in the long-run you should co-operate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Logos have to be used for all purposes. (I know two others have said that already.)</p>
<p>An example is the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp) who spent the better part of a million dollars to come up with an animated logo that looked wonderful in the TV commercials. Then they tried using it in their printed media, and had a great deal of trouble getting the animation to work well.</p>
<p>In the end, the logo was simplified considerably, and now works well in print and animated.</p>
<p>Not as big a fiasco as NBCs, but still notable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some good things to keep in mind when doing a logo are:</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a spot colour and CMYK, make sure you do a straight 4 colour version as well.
Make a 2 colour version, if you use a pantone colour
Make a reversed (white) version and set your Illustrator file to &lsquo;view outlines&rsquo; or set it on a dark background so people can see it when they open the file
A 1 colour version (generally black), sometimes it&rsquo;s ok to go with different shades of black to show different areas, but be careful if you do so.
make RGB versions of the above coloured and 1 colour logos.
Include the correct values for PMS, CMYK and RGB in the standards guide</p>
<p>Make sure the logo will scan and fax well.
Check legibility at small sizes – it might be worth it to create a second version for use when scaled under a specific dimension. 
Set a minimum size in inches and pixels tho logo can be scaled down to, to ensure the best possible representation. 
Create a guide for the amount of space left around the logo.</p>

<p>Similarly, I like to envision the logo embroidered on a shirt. If it has small spidery lines, or other fine details, it probably won&rsquo;t work very well. Unless it&rsquo;s a logo for a black metal band.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Also consider the use(s) of the logo - you might want variants. For example if it&rsquo;s a stacked logo you might need to do an all-on-one-line version. Try to anticipate every use the logo might have so that you can - as best as possible - prepare guidelines for it. If you leave matters to chance your client or their web designer may do something you don&rsquo;t like.</div>
