  body: 'Michelangelo, in the metal version, has a U with a stem, which the text here
    doesn&#39;t. Zapf has changed Palatino over the years, making it less mannered.
    This might be an earlier version than the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/roman/testdrive.html?s=GLADIATOR&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">current one</a>. '

  body: You&#39;re right, William. It looks like a cross between &#34;foundry&#34;
    Palatino and Michelangelo. Here are some <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/palatino2.html">earlier
    Palatino samples</a>. I haven&#39;t found an online sample of Michelangelo yet.

  body: OK, here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/090172000.html">link
    to Michelangelo</a>, but it doesn&#39;t help me any. The U, R, and P are different
    for sure -- I haven&#39;t examined it closely, but there are still a lot of similarities.
