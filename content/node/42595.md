  <em>Futura</em>. Both <em>Twentieth Century</em> and <em>Spartan</em>\u2014where
  can I find studies on the histories of these faces? Just HOW much of them is directly
  related to <em>Futura</em> and how much is mere well-intentioned emulation? \r\n\r\nAll
  this to say, I'm considering completely RE-NAMING the faces <em>Futura</em>? We
  have some sizes of <em>Futura</em>, some of <em>Spartan</em>, and some <em>Twentieth
  Century</em>. It would be nice to homogenize them, but I only want to do that if
  the others truly are imitations of Renner's design. Just how different are they? "

  body: "In the case of Spartan (Linotype version), the main differences are the lowercase
    'a', which had both a one-story and two-story design; the left quote marks were
    available either rotated 180\xB0 or mirrored from the right hand variety, and
    the question mark is of a more usual design, instead of the backward 'S' design
    in the original.\r\n\r\nThe ATF version of Spartan is the same, except it has
    only the one-story 'a' and only mirrored quote marks."

    It's a discussion about geometric sans like Futura, and Paul Hunt talks a little
    about Twentieth Century. He's the one to re-digitize it for the Lanston Type Company.
    \r\n\r\nThey ARE different faces, and I personally feel that you should keep the
    names accurately."

  body: 'No, you''re right. It''s "vs." if they are competing. "v." if it is a comparison.
    I think. Anyway, I was typing haphazardly. My main question is: "Would it be blasphemy
    to call <em>Twentieth Century</em> <em>Futura</em> instead?"'

  body: "Sii, are you being facetious? I got the impression (no pun intended) that
    Keoxa is talking about several cases of metal type. You can label the drawers
    whatever you want.\r\n\r\nSpartan (Lino & ATF) and Twentieth Century (Monotype)
    are for all intents and purposes copies of Futura, according to McGrew.\r\n\r\nKeoxa,
    you can read a little bit about them in <cite>American Metal Typefaces of the
    Twentieth Century</cite> by Mac McGrew -- highly recommended if you're involved
    in letterpress.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kentlew is correct. These are lead letters I'm talking about, not the \"re-digitized\"
    versions or any other. Thanks for the book recommendation, I'll scour those pages
    for details. \r\n\r\nI want to know how different they are, and perhaps I should
    just print my own samples, scan them and digitally compare them. Because, depending
    on the foundry, there are PLENTY of variations in typefaces like <em>Caslon</em>
    and <em>Garamond</em>, and it is up to us to determine which ones are most faithful
    and useful. Nevertheless, we're still able to call them by there common names.
    I'm suggesting that the names <em>Spartan</em>, and <em>Twentieth Century</em>
    are more corporate safeguards than honorable names for the type, so I'd like to
    keep it real in my pressroom. "

  body: "McGrew describes the differences. They are not many. He does not consider
    them significant. You might have to decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you compared
    the same sizes of all three, you might notice the differences. But mixing one
    size of Spartan on a page with a different size of Twentieth Century, for example,
    would probably not show up any appreciable variances. Especially if you consider
    that there are sometimes subtle differences between different sizes of the same
    nominal typeface in metal anyway.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if it was me, I'd probably
    keep the different drawers labeled according to the different fonts to retain
    the info about the original provenance, but perhaps arrange the drawers in the
    same cabinet acknowledging that the different sizes can essentially stand in for
    each other.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"
