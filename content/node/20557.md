body: "One of the most successful and engaging type review lessons I conduct in the
  classroom is playing Type Jeopardy. I start off by teaching first year students
  the history of type, and following up with short activites. Although I adore history
  and everything about it, not every student shares my exuberance. Naturally, my slides
  are filled with colourful photographs and I tell interesting stories about how art
  and type is influenced by the time and place in which it is created. \r\n\r\nAfter
  the first class, subsequent classes begin with a review in the form of Type Jeopardy.
  I have categories to choose from (based on the previous class lesson). An early
  review week might consist of these categories: Movements and Eras; Terminology;
  Notable People; Type Styles; and Odds 'n' Sods. There is always a final question,
  as well.\r\n\r\nSo, as an example, under \"Terminology\", the questions might be:\r\n100
  \ The first letter or text is set as a larger or decorative letter used to introdue
  a section of type\r\n200  Letters slanted to the right, distinct from Roman letters
  in their form, used for emphasis\r\n300  Parts of lowercase letters that project
  above and below the boundaries of Capital letters\r\n400  Connected letters or overlapped
  letters that scribes often made when handwriting, to save space\r\n500  The Gothic
  lettering style was also referred to as this\r\n\r\nFinal Question: A publisher's
  emblem or inscription usually placed at the end of a book, giving facts about its
  publication is called what?\r\n\r\nI break the class up into groups of 5 or 6 and
  they are allowed to collaborate. Each group has a group name and their scores are
  recorded on the blackboard, and added up in the end. One person from each group
  is given a bicycle horn to squeak when the group has an answer. Naturally, they
  have to state the answer in the form of a question. The winning group gets candy
  or dollar store prizes. It is truly amazing to see how hard they'll work for the
  prizes.\r\n\r\nDo you have any successful and interesting teaching/learning methods?
  Please feel free to share them!"

    game i remember playing. Some teachers would just ask questions and throw candy
    to the winners. \r\n\r\nUhm we played hang man in english... you could do hang
    man with type terms.\r\n\r\nOr charades with type terms. Any of those games that
    you have to act out or use other words for to describe the term. You could come
    up with a set of terms and also a set of terms they can't say to describe it,
    so if the term is \"Capital\" they can't say large or uppercase or big, etc.\r\n\r\n"

    drawing of sorts. Like you could draw out hanging punctuation, ascenders, descenders
    - parts of letters. And the hangman idea is good too - thanks for the input!\r\n\r\nNorbert:
    All you have to do is get a virtual candy fund happenning for virtual candy. I
    can almost see the candy dingbat now! : )"

  body: "Flash cards were always a good way to learn I think. So like personal jeapordy
    put a definition on one side and they gotta get the word. But you can do it with
    a partner so it goes quicker. \r\n\r\nOr you could have one word on one side that
    relates to the word on the other side and they gotta guess what the other word
    is. Simple would be Uppercase/lowercase, kern/letterspace, kern/leading, or kern/squooshed,
    etc. That way they gotta know all the possabilities to get the right one. (just
    don't make tests like this because then they might come looking for me :P)"

  body: Flash cards, eh? Interesting. I like the "get everyone involved in the classroom
    together" idea better but this is an interesting side step too. I can remember
    doing the flash card thing in elementary school, with math questions. Two lines
    of students and the teacher holding up the cards at the front. If you missed the
    answer, you went 'round to the back of the line you were standing in. The winner
    stayed on for as long as he/she could. That might work even better. Great help,
    Jesse - thanks!

  body: "I was just called yesterday by Montserrat College of Art, located north of
    Boston. They asked if I was interested in taking over the Typography I course
    and that I would have latitude in revising the existing curriculum. (That is,
    if I pass muster with their Dean!)\r\n\r\nSeems that previously, one of the intructors
    focused on technical aspects and the one before that on creative aspects of typography.\r\n\r\nI
    happen to believe both are integral, as it always has been historically... advancements
    in printing, metalurgy, photography, computers directly effect the shape and use
    of type, while it is up to the creatives to harness that power.\r\n\r\nOddly enough,
    Montserrat is the school that invited Hrant to speak and staged his <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18990\"
    target=\"new\">A Line of Type</a> exhibit this past April."

  body: "Amy Conger (at CCSF) once gave me the great bit of advice that an ice-breaker
    during the first class session can make a big difference. My ploy involved the
    strong parallel between shoe design/making and type design, and I asked the students
    to come up to the board and write entries in two columns: their ideal shoe; and
    the type of shoe they actually typically wear. The point being to distinguish
    between display fonts and text fonts. Plus I stepped out of the classroom as they
    were doing this, so they would be more comfortable, being anonymous. It worked
    like a charm: the apprehensive expressions at the start of the class immediately
    turned into involved smirks. (On the other hand, if most of the students were
    men it might not have worked as well. :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
