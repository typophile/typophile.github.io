  Sir\" note. Also, what is the classification of the main font? And the one at the
  bottom that reads \"Frederick Warne & Co.\"--that is a Tuscan, affirmative? \r\n\r\nAs
  always, thank you!!\r\n\r\n"

    The old specimen books; MS&J, ATF/Pacific Blue, Daystrom etc. online at Archive.org,
    give excellent images of most of the letters. They miss a few, but the on-line
    patent -- despite its crappy image quality from the scan of a bad microfilm --
    gives a clear idea of how Ihlenburg designed the remaining capitals.\r\nDon"

    designer has to speak like a lawyer.\r\n\r\n---start quote---\r\n[Cut scanned
    image of crappy quality microfilm specimen and assorted introductory stuff]\r\nUNITED
    STATES PATENT OFFICE.\r\n\r\nHERMAN IHLENBURG, OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA,
    ASSIGNOR TO THE MACKELLAR, SMITHS & JORDAN COMPANY, OF SAME PLACE.\r\n\r\nDESIGN
    FOR TYPE.\r\n\r\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Design No. 16,294, dated September
    29, 1885.\r\n\r\nApplicaiion filed March 16, 1885.\r\nTo all whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nBe
    it known that I, HERMAN IHLENBURG, (assigner to the MACKELLAR, SMITHS & JORDAN
    COMPANY,) of the city and county of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have invented
    and produced a new and original Design for a Font of Printing Type, of which the
    following is a specification.\r\n\r\nThe nature of my design is clearly shown
    in the accompanying typographic impression, to which reference is made; and it
    consists of a text letter of the back-hand class, the upper and lower parts of
    said letter being heavier than the rest of the letter.\r\n\r\nThe upper portions
    of the B, E, F, G, K, P, R, S, T, Y, X, and Z are curved as shownthe B, P, R,
    and Z upon the left, as shown, the rest of the letters upon the right, as shown.
    The upper termination of the E, F, H, K, M, N, U, V, W, X, and Y upon the left
    is curved as shown. The upper right-hand termination of the H, L, M, N, U, V,
    and W is curved as shown. The upper right termination of the C is followed by
    the inclined line with dot termination. The lower right-hand termination of the
    G is met by the short curved line. The central termination of the E and F consists
    of the short curved line with dot termination. The I, K, M, R, and Y are extended
    below the line, as shown.\r\n\r\nHaving now described my invention, I claim --\r\nThe
    design for a font of printing type of the back-hand text class, the upper and
    lower portions of the letters being,` heavier than the rest of the same, the upper
    portions of the B, E, F, G, K, P, R, S, T, Y, X, and Z curved as shown, the B,
    P, R, and Z upon the left, the rest of the letters upon the right, the upper termination
    of the E, F, H, K, M, N, U, Y, W, X, and Y upon the left, curved as shown, the
    upper right-hand termination of the H, L, M, N, U,V, and W curved as shown, the
    upper right-hand termination of the C followed by the inclined line with dot termination,
    the lower right-hand termination of the G met by the short curved line the central
    termination of the E and F consisting of the short curved line with dot termination,
    and the I, K, M, R, and Y extended below the line, as shown.\r\n\r\nHERMAN IHLENBURG.\r\nIn
    presence of \r\nG. F. HUCH, \r\nHERMAN METUS.\r\n\r\n--- end quote --\r\nIf this
    makes any sense to you and you can visualize the letters, fame and fortune awaits
    you in your career as a patent lawyer!\r\nAfter applying every trick I know to
    enhance and edit the patent image this was the best I could cobble together. It
    lacks all of the nuances of the penmanship, but at least has the basic letter-forms
    that match the legalese.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/D16294SM_3630.jpg]\r\nEnjoy
    the game!\r\nDon"

  body: "I actually digitized this as a personal exercise some time ago. One of my
    first attempts at both making a font and at revival. You will therefore forgive
    any amateur errors. The spacing/kerning needs some work, but  it is quite some
    time since this has been forgotten and gathering dust. If Nick is going to do
    it, it will no doubt be better by far than anything I can achieve and I will leave
    it up to him.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pencraft_ai_6642.png]"

  body: "Hi Andrew. Nick has done wonderful work in the past but I am not certain
    when we might see something new from him. AFAIK the last font he released was
    in 2012 -- at least that's the last one at Myfonts.\r\nSo, as the old adage goes
    \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\" \r\nClearly you feel that your
    digital version is less finished than you would prefer. If this is something you
    were preparing for sale as a commercial font, I can understand your hesitation
    to make it available to the public. But if, as you say, you \"digitized this as
    a personal exercise,\" could you be willing to share it with people who love old
    fonts, perhaps by releasing a Beta Version at Dafont?\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks, Don. Encouraged by your post I think I'll take another look at this
    and see what needs to be done to get it close to something releasable. It may
    not be as bad as I think and I did put quite a bit of work into it. The Original
    swash caps were 36 or 24-point sorts, mortized to fit 18 or 12-point regular lower-case.
    I designed my Swash caps to be used at 150% of the regular font (so 18-point for
    12-point type). I'm not sure most of the people downloading fonts from DaFont
    will grok that, but I couldn't see another way to do it without making the x-height
    ridiculously small.\r\n\r\n@malbright - if you're looking for something similar
    in the meantime, you may wish to check out [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/evita/std/|Evita]],

  body: "Hi Andrew, happy you are willing to consider going forward with this. I appreciate
    the technical problems. As for the people downloading from Dafont, they range
    from the kid looking for something to plaster on a smartphone screen, to searchers
    for unusual technical treatments, like the ones who haunt this page :) BTW tiny
    x height works fine in script fonts -- including Penman 1885 -- when it is printed
    on paper at a reasonable size. This issue only arises when you use the mortised
    swash caps. The regular caps have a very common ratio to the x-height. \r\nWhatever
    you put in your BETA, it would be a vast improvement over having almost nothing
    digital that is representative of this unique style of typeface.\r\nDon\r\n"
