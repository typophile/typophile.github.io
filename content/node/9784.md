body: what would be the advantages/drawbacks of placing oldstyle figures as the default
  figure style in an OT font? i&#39;m trying to decide whether i should do it  or
  not.

  body: My only concern is convention or just plain habit.  Even though you may find
    oldstyle the one you would most often use, people are accustomed to seeing lining
    figures as the default and your way might confuse them.  If they have standard
    style sheets with lining figures used in tables, they can change only the font
    in the style sheet and get the expected result.  If they use your font, they don&#39;t
    get what they expect.

  body: Figure style is a big part of the personality of a typeface. If you think
    oldstyle figures are the ones most in keeping with the style of your font, I&#39;d
    go ahead and make them the default. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s OpenType, so people can
    change the figure style to suit their preferences. The only real disadvantage
    is that only the Adobe apps make it easy to select figure style right now, so
    people who want to use lining figures might curse you, but that goes both ways.

  body: Paul, <BR> <BR>I think Chris mentions the major concern -- people are used
    to seeing lining figures.  Minor concerns are what would happen when users attempted
    to typeset math, and what would happen with tabular figures.  If it&#39;s an OpenType
    font, and you include the other figure types, users could just choose what they
    want.  When I convert my OpenType fonts into TeX fonts, I always use onum for
    the default fonts because it&#39;s what I want.  But I also make lining &#34;versions&#34;
    because I&#39;ll be using those in mathematical expressions. <BR> <BR>Forrest,
    <BR> <BR>TeX and friends can use figure styles &#40;or any other OpenType feature&#41;
    without any problem.  I use &#39;otftotfm&#39; to make a variety of different
    Type 1 fonts that I use in my TeX documents &#40;one with lining figures, one
    with discretionary ligatures, etc.&#41;.  In fact, I&#39;d imagine you could use
    the same tool on any platform to extract whatever Type 1 variants you want.  It&#39;s
    not quite as convenient as choosing the feature from a menu in InDesign, but it&#39;s
    also not a huge problem. <BR> <BR>Chris Swingley, Fairbanks Alaska
