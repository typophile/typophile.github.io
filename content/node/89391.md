  body: Almost thought it was a Futura Condensed until i saw the M, and other ones
    like Base 9 has similarities. Not something I have or know that has all it's attributes.
    If it's just for a headline, possible to alter a Futura type in Outlines to get
    what your looking for.

  body: "Looks like a (rather strained) exponent of the New Clumsy Vintage \xE6sthetic.
    I don't know what exactly it is, but it's quite possible that it's a typeface.
    I'd guess a recent one, I'd surmise from a small [European] foundry and/or a young
    designer. Sorry I can't be of more help."
