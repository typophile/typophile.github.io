  body: ' Hi, <BR> <BR>I am also trying to find the &#34;e&#34; &#40;estimated&#41;
    symbol that is used on European packaging. I have looked at the unicode site Hrant
    posted and found it under &#39;letterlike symbols&#39;. Now all I want to know
    is if I can use any latin &#34;e&#34; as that symbol or is there a specific keystroke
    sequence to produce it? Key Caps isnt giving me any joy. <BR> <BR>Martin, are
    they still using the Drachmer or have they switched to Euro? &#40;sorry, from

    that they are still accepting the currency! At least I&#39;ll have some change
    when I go over next ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I found that estimated symbol on myfonts.

  body: Bren, I think there might be no specific location for the &#34;estimated&#34;
    symbol. That&#39;s probably because it is considered more of a symbol/logo than
    a glyph. The only place were you can find it is in specific logo- and symbolfonts,
    and its location varies. <BR> <BR>And I must disagree with your opinion about
    the &#34;euro&#34;, there are some fine designs in currently issued typefaces.
    It&#39;s very similar in concept to the dollar or yen-sign. You just have to stay
    away as far as possible from the official geometric Euro &#34;logotype&#34; as
    found in Adobe Euro Sans... ugh. <BR> <BR>If you wanna find out which currencies
    became obsolete, check <A HREF="http://www.xe.net/currency/" TARGET="_blank">
    The Universal Currency Converter&#40;tm&#41;</A>. When you select one of those
    currencies, it gives you a warning.
