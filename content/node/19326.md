  Pro</a> as copy in a book I am writing about school yearbooks.\r\n\r\nBecause the
  book also has magazine style sections, I'm trying to find sans serifs which work
  well with Chaparral.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using <a href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/31.html\">Expressway</a>
  by Ray Larabie, but I always get the feeling they clash a little.\r\n\r\n-> Any
  suggestions on what sans work well with Chaparral?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall look I
  am trying to achieve is 'fresh', 'reservedly exciting', and 'confident'.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your drips of knowledge.\r\n"

    well with Chaparral. The x-height and weights match up well. I also like Neutraface
    display drafting as a titling font with Chaparral.
