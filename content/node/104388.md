    the printer is careful, but newspapers are usually printed on a web press (a big
    roll of paper that's not cut apart until after it's printed) and the emphasis
    is on speed rather than quality, so you might want to avoid tiny reversed-out
    type until you're sure the printer is really doing a quality job with good color
    registration.

  body: "I think your third new layout shows most promise. I assume it'll have variants
    with more conventional headlines? Headline-in-picture looks very professional,
    but it's restricted to top newspapers for a reason: it's difficult to do convincingly
    and requires the right picture material to work. (I've worked as a page editor
    at one of Sweden's biggest newspapers, trust me on this.)\r\n\r\nThings in general
    you'll want to consider, that are more or less problematic accross the different
    layouts at the moment:\r\n\r\n* Establishing a clear hierarchy of articles and
    headline styles. A messy layout with articles of different length and different
    headline size placed willy-nilly is more difficult to read and orientate yourself
    in. If you're going for (for instance) a bigger-font-size one-column headline
    (which seems to be the case here), make sure it's consistently applied as such,
    is clearly delimited from other headline styles, and perhaps if possible always
    has the exact same font size, number of lines, and position on the page.\r\n\r\n*
    Establishing a clear demarcation if what articles belong together and which don't.
    A hairline-width line between articles on different topics (and the absence of
    one where the two are on the same topic) is one helpful way of doing this, or
    it can be achieved with clever picture placement, colour boxes... (PS. Why are
    your lines generally this thickness? It's probably a personal preference, but
    most newspapers at least here tend to have thinner lines, or intentionally chunkier
    ones. :))\r\n\r\n* Establishing a set of clearly navigable page layouts/grids.
    There's a reason most five-column-design tabloid-size newspapers have 3+2 and/or
    4+1 layouts (one or two columns divided off, consistently, on every page or every
    alternate page) \u2013 it makes reading and article hierarchy all the easier.
    Another classic is having (consistent-height) small articles running along the
    bottom of pages. These same columns and bottom articles can also be used for side
    content on feature pages. (Clearly, this does not apply to the front page, but
    having a consistent layout idea helps there, too.)  One thing it definitely makes
    easier \u2013 which I see you're having problems with \u2013 is getting elements
    to line up visually. If something on a page sticks up a centimeter above something
    else, you're probably doing it wrong. \r\n\r\n* Use consistent spacing between
    elements as far as possible. One example: those writer bylines! In every layout,
    they're floating all over the place, sometimes far from the headline, sometimes
    far from the body copy. Stuff like this needs to be consistent, or it looks messy.\r\n\r\n*
    Give stuff room to breathe! If there's anything that looks unprofessional at first
    glance in your layouts (which otherwise are frankly very well done for high-school
    level) it's the way things are occasionally squeezed into too-tight containers,
    tracked too tightly, line-spaced too tightly. For instance, all of your colour
    boxes (that are a great way of establishing hierarchy) have the text simply running
    too close to their edges \u2013 you sould narrow the text column inside to give
    at least a milimeter or two more margin, it'll make them instantly more readable.
    And in general: Good use of white space is one thing that truly sets apart professional
    products."

  body: "I am the creative director of a large newspaper that is currently going through
    a redesign. We have decided on Coranto 2 for body text and Coranto 2 Headline
    for (obviously) headlines.\r\n\r\nImmediately, there are some really problematic
    things that I see with your design that can be fixed relatively easily, depending
    on how good of an eye you have for these things.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I think Coranto
    2 is set too large for the body type \u2013 but maybe just by a few tenths of
    a point. Certainly the leading is too tight. It definitely needs to go up. I'm
    not sure if you read it, but the post just above your return to this thread details
    a problem that is caused by your leading. Definitely have a read into that.\r\n\r\nThe
    widths of the teaser boxes seem to have been chosen arbitrarily. That's not good
    at all. Given that there are four boxes in the space of four columns, it looks
    very jarring to not see them match up with the columns. If you had a different
    number \u2013 say three or five \u2014 then you could work with it, but not like
    that. \r\n\r\nThe way you have that photo of the woman in a sash and the way it
    doesn't match up with the column is also very jarring. Having the credits running
    on the side is not a justification for not running the image the full column width.
    It just looks wrong.\r\n\r\nFinally, the \"Sabio: One band, one sound\" piece
    also looks wrong because the text box doesn't fit the width of the column, and
    it looks like you've done it this way just so it can have a line running down
    the right. I would get rid of it.\r\n\r\nI am on a panel of judges of a secondary
    school newspaper and magazine design competition, and these are the things that
    I would pick out as problematic things.\r\n\r\nBut the reasons I would pick out
    these things, especially the way you've overlooked really core typographic features
    like adequate leading, is because design is not how it looks. It's not that veneer
    and those pretty font choices, but how it functions as a newspaper for the reader.
    Design is how it works!\r\n\r\nYou need to go back to basics and look at it from
    that point of view: you are designing things in such a way so as for them to have
    a function that benefits the reader.\r\n\r\n(Also, I am not sure I like the way
    the \"T\" runs into the \"h\" in the masthead \u2013 it draws too much attention
    onto an unimportant word in the title. I also feel like the kerning around the
    \"O\" in \"Pioneer\" is too tight.)\r\n"
