  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, <BR> <BR>I thought I'd give myself a good grounding the classics, so I'm reading up on Tschichold's work and Geoffrey Dowding's &quot;Finer Points&quot;.  I was wondering: does anyone here use the ampersand in body text to improve spacing and lines, and if so, when, where and why? <BR> <BR>Many thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think this used to be acceptable practice a long time ago. The most recent example I know of (there must be more though) is Eric Gill's heavy use of the ampersand in his wonderful &quot;Essay on Typography&quot; - although I don't know if it was for spacing, color, or what. <BR> <BR>I myself use the ampersand, but very rarely in formal text, basically for things like &quot;cut &amp; paste&quot;, or sometimes to group things in a complex sentence, like this: &quot;&hellip; for which Perrin drew, and had engraved &amp; cast his Augustaux capitals.&quot; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fine book work my arse. Book are meant to be read. Splitting 'Five' and 'hundred copies' like this is just a barrier to understanding, and neither of the two uses of an ampersand in this dog's breakfast can be justified grammatically. Does anyone really still believe that typographic masturbation like this is fit work for a grown man? <BR> <BR>Back in the real world, those of us for whom legibility and ease of use is of rather more concern know that ampersands should never be used as a substitute for 'and' in the run of text (or, for that matter, headlines), except where they form part of an organisation's name (ie Marks &amp; Spencer, P&amp;O) or an accepted abbreviation (like 'b&amp;b').  <BR> <BR>What may have been acceptable common practice in Eric Gill's day (putting full points between initials, using 'tho' for 'though', overenthusiastic dog-worrying) isn't any more.  <BR> <BR>And, at the risk of offending Hrant too, I think that rewriting a sentence to make it comprehensible is always better than inserting ampersands.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm sure Gerald will correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the 2 ampersands in his wine glass there for spacing reasons? I.e., to make the lines fall in a fairly smooth contour while having reasonably even spacing among the words? Seems to me like that's something more than mere wanking. <BR> <BR>And this is perhaps a nit-picky and non-productive comment, but I wouldn't say that an ampersand is poor <i>grammar</i> so much as poor <i>usage</i>. Or at least non-standard usage. It's not the use of the word &quot;and&quot; that's in question in any of these instances &ndash; it's how you write it.</div>

I'm not sure I agree with the use of the phrase grammatically correct. Perhaps typographically correct would be better, but even then &hellip; Well, the ampersand as we know it today comes in all beautiful varieties and not only in the curvy and curly variety. Perhaps more type designers, now that opentype gives us gazillion character options, should give us an &quot;et&quot; that is a little more transparent so we can use it once again in long settings of text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wouldn't have guessed that the ampersand had common use in running English typeset text. I use the ampersand for anything I want to join into a unit, a sort of verbal/visual ligature between words. It also makes more compact headlines, making for a quicker 'hit'. Also, this technique has, in my opinion, been co-opted by companies and commerce. <BR> <BR>Thus, I would write: <BR>&quot;Bed &amp; Breakfast&quot; <BR>&quot;Bartles &amp; James&quot; <BR>&quot;Barnes &amp; Noble&quot; <BR>&quot;it's raining cats and dogs&quot; <BR>&quot;I use both ampersands and words&quot; <BR> <BR>I think David Foster Wallace actually uses ampersands in some sentences to specifically imbue something with a sponsored, branded feel. <BR> <BR>From a practical perspective, I would never be able to convince a typical client that an ampersand is acceptable, and I don't think I could provide a convincing argument to reverse their opinion. It may not affect the texture of the page, but an unexplained ampersand in modern text will most likely jar the reader. My concerns with the ampersand are less typographic and more editorial/reader oriented.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I feel these rules were set in place for a reason, if not then why are they their. I live in smallish city where labor work is king, and I see so many grammatical errors in advertising and basic written communications - its like I am living in a city of preschoolers. I think this is due in part the importance education played within the lives of these people and also in part to the lack of focus people like designers and writers place on the end results of not educating people etc&hellip; The syntax for ampersand may not be as important as some grammar rules, but if we as designers do not know or follow the rules and demonstrate or educate those who are unaware, we will only perpetuate the dumb asses who somehow think they&rsquo;re being creative by spelling words the way they want or breaking grammar rules.. if this keeps up where will the simple rules go that define the English language? At some point my job as a graphic designer - communicating messages will become even more difficult in having to deal with the dumb-arse&rsquo;s who insists on his/her dumb-arse English skills. Damn it now I&rsquo;m angry for no reason! Designers and writers are in a position to educate the dumb-arses and I try to do my best here&hellip; hopefully you do too! : ) peace</div>
