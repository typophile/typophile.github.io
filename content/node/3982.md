  <BR>My group of student started to design a typeface together 3 weeks ago. We hope
  to finish a final font around the end of May. Each friday, I post online couple
  of comments and bunch of images reporting where they are now. Click on the efojalict
  image to access to the current stage. Or start with that first one: <BR><a href="http://perso.ensad.fr/%7eensadtypo/travaux/cookerblack.html"

  <BR> <BR>Despite its in French, English comments are welcome via the &#34;commentez&#34;
  link. <BR> <BR><a href="http://erik.letterror.com/cgi-python/tm/cooker" target="_blank">http://erik.letterror.com/cgi-python/tm/cooker</a>
  <BR>The subject started his life with the Erik van Blokland TypeCooker &#40;thanks
  to this list for the announce of it&#41;, so, naturally the working name was Cooker
  Black. <BR>'

  body: '&#62; not very sharp specially on web. <BR> <BR>I guess you mean that it
    looks bad on the computer screen? This is a tricky issue even with Latin. You
    either have to learn how to &#34;Hint&#34; your fonts &#40;an extra step in font
    design where you add &#34;guidelines&#34; for low-resolution rendering to look
    better&#41;, or turn on anti-aliasing for all sizes and live with the resultant
    blurriness. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR>That&#39;s some nice stuff on there. I can see that although my French is
    really bad. I started sketching on 29-02-04 on a font with the same inner form
    like yours. Nice to see that a good idea is braught to paper. ;-&#41; I will be
    watching your updates. Keep them coming. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>
