  the days before The Internet was a household word, when private online networks
  were all the rage. Back when David Lynch was making tv shows. In those prehistoric
  times, I used to spend a substantial part of my free time on CompuServe&#39;s Desktop
  Publishing Forum. Somewhere in the mid-nineties, I was lured away by the internet
  and never looked back. <BR> <BR>The forum continued on without me. Yesterday, I
  received a note from Kathleen Tinkle saying that it has recently detached itself
  from the mothership and set down on the vast &#40;and hopefully more favorable&#41;
  frontier of the World Wide Web &#40;<a href="http://desktoppublishingforum.com/"

  an good luck to Kathleen and her cohorts. I&#39;m not really &#34;doing DTP&#34;
  anymore, but I&#39;m going to check it out and encourage others to do so as well.
  I hear some of them like to talk about type.'
