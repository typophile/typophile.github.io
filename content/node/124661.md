  font for years and used it fairly often, however when we redid our computer system,
  my father didn't set up any of the old fonts I had gathered over time. I found some
  of them, and set them up, but I couldn't find this one, and I can't remember what
  it's called. I have been trying to remember for a week. I have used all of the automatic
  font identification sites I could find, and they didn't come up with anything helpful.
  :P I don't know any information about the font, and I don't have many samples of
  it left, but I would recognize the name if I ever saw it. "
