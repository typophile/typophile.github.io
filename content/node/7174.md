  a historical type specimen for my typography class. <BR> <BR>Thanks!"

    Didot, Pierre l\u2019a\xEEn\xE9 Didot and Firmin Didot cut \u2013 what were the

  body: In old time, a typeface never got a name such we use now. We call Garamond,
    Bodoni, Baskerville to refer to a particular style ow their creators/designers/cutters.
    <BR> <BR>Typefaces used name following their sizes, cut, but it was a generic
    name not related to the style. <BR> <BR>So, in a print shop, around 1789 for example
    in France, the Mignone size can be a Fournier &#40;how we call it now&#41; when
    the Cicero can be a Garamond &#40;how we call it now&#41;. <BR> <BR>And if you
    cross the street, and went to another print shop, well, perhaps this one is more
    up to date, and their you will found for same sizes, some earlier cut of a Didot...

  body: Rod, in short, I don&#39;t know the answer to your question. <BR> <BR>But,
    the Didot family cut <b>many</b> typefaces &#40;most of which were probably named
    by their <i>size</i> instead of their <i>styles,</i> as JFP said above&#41;. If
    you went to a Didot press to have your stuff printed, you got it printed in &#34;their&#34;
    typefaces. If you went somewhere else &#40;esp. I guess, in Holland&#41;, you
    would get the typefaces that that printer used. I don&#39;t think that you could
    just walk into a printing office in the 1700s and say, &#34;I really dig John
    Baskerville&#39;s types, can you print my book in that instead of Caslon&#39;s?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Bodoni in Parma used his own typefaces as well, which appear similar
    &#40;relatively&#41; to Didot family typefaces. But Giambattista Bodoni&#39;s
    typefaces were not Didot typefaces, and Didot family typefaces were not made by
    G. Bodoni, even though later historians grouped them all under the heading &#34;Didones.&#34;
    Confusing enough? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what Ralph is hinting at. &#40;Can
    you elaborate, Ralph? Didot-made typefaces were never called Bodoni typefaces
    while the Didots were alive, as far as I know.&#41;

  body: What we know as Bodoni, historically followed what the Didot Family did. From
    what I remember from that lecture &#40;given by James Mosley&#41; Giambattista
    Bodoni was hired in Parma to create something similar to what was happening in
    Paris at the time. Some people had left Paris but still wanted to feel a part
    of what was happening. Even then people were aware of what we call today, trends.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;I&#39;d love for this to be fleshed out as I lost my notes&#41;

  body: 'Tiffany, without looking at any books, what I recall is something like that:
    <BR> <BR>Bodoni intentions was to meet Baskerville in England but stopped in Paris
    due to sikness. Anyway, before this trip his first types were much influenced
    by Fournier -- then, by Baskerville &#43; Didot, its perhaps why Bodonis types
    are more flourished and round than the stricts Didots. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Didot
    was influenced by Baskerville when Bell, Austin were influenced by Didot! :-&#41;
    Well, type history is complex. <BR> <BR>&#34;Didones&#34; is simply Did&#40;ot&#41;
    &#43; &#40;Bo&#41;doni, like Garaldes is Gara&#40;mond&#41; &#43; Alde. <BR> <BR>The
    concept of different style of typefaces probably appeared during the 19th century,
    period during which Caslon started a second career, Sans and Fat faces appaered
    and period which, people like Perrin and Jannet started to cut sort of revivals
    of old faces.'

  body: Just a note to this. I recently picked up a copy of Specimen de Caracteres
    of Typographie Firmin-Didot et cie that dates from the early 1920s. The specimen
    catalog has the Didot and Poetique Didot showings. Interestingly, unlike Anglo-American
    specimen books the name of the type size precedes the typeface name. While not
    as caught up with the typographic revival, as typical of Spain and Italy as well
    during this time period, some really nice vignettes!!!
