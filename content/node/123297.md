  some brush lettering for a friend, and can't seem to get an even weight through
  the whole mark. I think it's the \"r\"s? Does the \"y\" look too upright? That last
  \"s\" is super weird, right? Any suggestions on how to fix anything would be much
  appreciated! I'm finding that you have to make a lot of very purposeful decisions
  in Illustrator that you wouldn't notice while drawing everything an inch high in
  pen.\r\nThanks so much!\r\nJenna"

    be nice \u2014\_the Es and Rs \u2014 so it doesn't look like a word just set in
    a font, I think you'd want more of a handwritten look. Also do you really need
    the apostrophe at the end? I'm not a grammar expert but it looks a bit odd in
    a single word by itself."

  body: "@JamesM Thanks for the feedback, that's so true! I must have gone a little
    crazy trying to make everything look slick and lost some of the original sketch
    along the way.\r\n\r\nHere's where I am now\u2014I'm trying to talk the client
    out of the berries at the bottom, as it's already going on the label for homemade
    jam. Maybe having a less rigid baseline might help a little, too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: Oof, forgot to mention it's a cute retired couple who make jam together, and
    they wanted their last name as the possessive to "homemade." Apostrophes at the
    end do look weird, though!

  body: "With \"homemade\" added the apostrophe makes sense. (I presume their name
    ends with an S, otherwise the apostrophe would come between the Y and S.)\r\n\r\nI
    don't care for the berries either.  One consideration is that when the logo is
    small, the berries become a blur. Probably not a factor on the label, but a logo
    needs to work in a small size.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berry_5523.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    hope they're not going to pay with with jam. ;)"

  body: Anthony has a good idea. Berries come in different shapes so maybe with the
    right berry it could work. But I think you'd need to make it work as a silhouette,
    as surface details would be lost in small sizes.

  body: Consider increasing the space between e/b/e/r. The e/b pair feels tight now
    that you've made the eye of the first 'e' larger. Conversely, the new shape of
    the second 'r' makes the r/y spacing feel a bit open.

  body: "I would consider losing the \"ears\" at the top of the \"e\"s. I assume you
    put it in as it reflects the one in the \"o\", but an \"e\" is not drawn like
    an \"o\", with the stroke rising and then reversing counterclockwise to complete
    the letter. I think the overall logotype would look a little cleaner and less
    busy if you take them on the out on the \"e\"s.\r\n\r\nI agree that the berry
    should come off the logotype. It looks very odd having this little detailed drawing
    dangling off this bold smooth flowing text. I think using it as an apostrophe
    would be lovely, if you can find a way of abstracting it a bit so it's more a
    shape than an illustration.\r\n\r\nThe \"homemade\" font is bugging me. It looks
    very severe and static compared to the type above it. I get the retro feel that
    you're going for, and I think it's appropriate, it just needs a bit more warmth
    to it. Maybe going from black to bold would soften it a bit?"
