<p>I would make this of the statement above: some people have said that Myriad is a rip-off of Frutiger. AF doesn&rsquo;t think that it is. Personally I agree with him.</p>

<p>A ploy to sell the print version? Or maybe an attempt to emulate it?</p>
<p>Fortuantely their CSS allows you to maximize the type size using your browser, making it somewhat more readable.</p>

<p><cite>It’s the design of everything ELSE that’s really scary.</cite></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s implying that <cite>people</cite> are actually designing things. It&rsquo;s my opinion that <strong>machines</strong> are doing most of the design these days. Most classmates/teachers/workmates/etc seem to be Photoshop Gurus, but there really isn&rsquo;t any design involved.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, the translation of that quote is a little odd. I don&rsquo;t take it to necessarily mean that AF is okay with Myriad. It would be nice to know what he intended to say there.</p>
<p>I think Myriad owes much of its identity to its multiple master origin; its design reflects the requirements and capabilities of that technology. I also think that the merits of its design have been proven by how frequently it is seen lately (despite MM going away). Apple and Wells Fargo are two significant examples, but I see it used everywhere these days &ndash; much more than I did ten years ago. The fact that it is used for so many prominent applications confirms to me that it has made its own place in the typographic milieu. (Reinforcing that thought: I often see the italic used by itself, too.)</p>
<p>Robert has told me many times that the collaboration with Carol was a crucial aspect to its design. Robert&rsquo;s own designs usually bear his personal fingerprint, and the back-and-forth with Carol for Myriad helped keep the design tempered and utilitarian, which was obviously the point from the beginning.</p>

<p>The context indicates that AF was speaking of Slimbach in a favorable way, i.e., the next Frutiger.</p>
<p>Who says they weren&rsquo;t speaking English and the Czech version isn&rsquo;t the translation? There isn&rsquo;t a Czech version of the article on the webpage. (Although, the little .jpegs at the bottom of the page show that the print edition was indeed at least also translated into Czech.)</p>
<p>It would make more sense since the intended final languages are Czech and English. If both parties spoke English, that means you would only have to translate <cite>once</cite>, instead of twice if AF doesn&rsquo;t speak Czech.</p>

<p>what does &ldquo;except the unnecessary doubt&rdquo; mean? If he&rsquo;s saying Robert&rsquo;s work is good, why state an exception for Myriad?

<p>I think it more likely that it is somewhat broken English from a non-native speaker. A translator would put it into smooth English from either German or French. In any case the message seems to be that he doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with Slimbach&rsquo;s Myriad.</p>
<p>Of course Myriad was influenced by Frutiger, but so have been a hundred others. Frutiger evidently recognizes that Myriad has enough of a different look to be part of the normal process of designers&ndash;in all fields&ndash;being strongly influenced by others, both past and present, but taking their ideas and making something significantly different.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I don&rsquo;t think that any of the faces strongly influenced by Frutiger, the typeface, are as good as the original, including Myriad.</p>
<p>Myriad&rsquo;s condensed version is somewhat of a different animal. I believe I remember reading on Typophile that it was done before there was the condensed version of Frutiger&ndash;which appears in Frutiger Next. And I remember reading that Slimbach drew the condensed and Twombly the regular, and then they revised each other&rsquo;s work. To me the lighter terminals on Myriad mean that the condensed version actually works better than the regular.</p>
<p>Just checking on screen the Frutiger Next Condensed and Myriad Condensed, I actually like the Myriad Condensed better.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I agree with you about Myriad Condensed, it&rsquo;s a very useful face, and the fitting is brilliant. When I was art directing, I used the Condensed a lot (great for sidebars and captions), but never the regular scaling.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Adrian&rsquo;s &ldquo;unnecessary doubt&rdquo; could also be interpreted as him saying that Myriad is unnecessarily close to Frutiger (the typeface), creating doubt as to whether it&rsquo;s plagiarism. That would be a subtle ethical nuance, like saying some people might consider it dubious, and perhaps he doesn&rsquo;t want to point a finger at a fellow designer, because no one is innocent and can do brilliant original designs all the time (including AF).</p>
<p>So, there is outright plagiarism, and &ldquo;too close for comfort&rdquo;, which is tolerable, but one should try and avoid it if possible.</p>

But as you say, he might have toned down his criticism.
One reason &ndash; as I said, no one is innocent, and even he has done some derivative designs.
Two, he might realize that having his eponymous face become a genre is pretty cool, right up there with Garamond and Bodoni.</div>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re being superfluously provocative. I&rsquo;m not seeing the &ldquo;revisionism&rdquo; in anything I said. Robert and Carol did indeed collaborate on Myriad, and I do believe that collaboration had a substantial impact on its design. If you dispute that, ask Robert yourself.</p>

<p>Um, yeah, you seem to want to make some big soap opera out of it, but I think you&rsquo;re letting your imagination get away from you. If it&rsquo;s more exciting for you to project all this controversy and drama onto the matter, then have fun with that. I don&rsquo;t see the relevance.</p>
