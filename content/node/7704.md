  from his version of Pliny&#39;s Historia Naturalis. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have
  the complete character set. <BR> <BR>So far, two universities &#40;Liverpool &amp;
  Glasgow&#41; with copies of the Jenson Pliny have let me down regarding requests
  for high-resolution photographs. Does anyone know of an institution that might be
  more helpful? I fully expect to pay through the nose. I just don&#39;t want to be
  fobbed off with excuses.

  body: Maybe the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University? When I was at RISD,
    we used to see books there all the time, and they had an extensive collection.
    Maybe being so close to an art school will make them more liberal with photographs.

  body: I will check with the John Carter Brown Library. Thanks, Dan. And yes, Tiffany,
    I checked Octavo. They have some wonderful stuff, but their catalogue is not very
    extensive yet.

    I&#39;d give my firstborn child &#40;if I had one, which I don&#39;t&#41; for
    one. I suggested to the University of Liverpool that they should make and market
    a digital copy of theirs, but they apparently have only one staff photographer,
    and she is busy with other projects at the moment. <BR> <BR>&#34;there&#39;s an
    article that might interest you: it&#39;s called &#34;Photographic Enlargements
    of Type Forms&#34; by Philip Gaskell, in the Journal of the Printing Historical
    Society, #7, 1971, pp 51-53, with 12 plates. One of the plates is from the De
    Evangelica of 1470; it shows about 60 letters, at just over 1&#34; em height.
    Want a scan? &#34; <BR> <BR>Do you have a scan available? I&#39;d love to see
    that, but I don&#39;t want to put you out.'
