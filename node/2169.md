  body: 'The numerals in the Javal book are full-lining: not very nice. <BR>With that
    small x-height, I think hybrid nums would be better. <BR> <BR>BTW, I haven&#39;t
    forgotten that - I&#39;m closing in on it from two fronts: I&#39;m reading up
    on late-19th century French type, and waiting for Amelia at RIT to peruse the
    Deberny specimens they have. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
