body: "One of the type designs I am working on is a revival of Eagle Bold, an ATF
  typeface attributed to Morris Benton in 1933. It\u2019s going to be a simple version
  and won\u2019t be named Eagle to prevent confusion with revivals already on the
  market. I expect to have it ready to go by the end of the month and am trying to
  decide if I need to license anything from whomever owns the remainders of ATF.\r\n\r\nFrom
  my point of view there is no need to license anything. I\u2019m not planning to
  use the name Eagle, so there don\u2019t appear to be any trademark issues. From
  what I can tell the original letters were designed for the NRA\u2014a US Government
  agency\u2014in 1933, which I <em>think</em> would put the rights into the public
  domain if copyrights had ever existed for type in the US, and Benton adapted Coiner\u2019s
  design, so it doesn\u2019t appear that I have any ethical obligation to work out
  a license with the current owners of ATF. \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: "A strong tradition among both legitimate European and American type designers
    is to reinterpret an older design, and produce a new original work, free of royalty.\r\n\r\nHere,
    however, the goal is an authentic revival, not an original design.\r\n\r\nThe
    difference here though is the fact that you are not calling it by the original
    name. \r\n\r\nYou add that as the design was created for the US goverment, the
    work then is public domain. This is likely the case, but all really depends upon
    the terms of the licensing agreement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, much time has passed,
    over 50 years, and no design ownership exists in secular law (although in Jewish
    law, schus hamechaber or hayotzrim can exist for generations).\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    a revival or a replica of an older classical work has its own merit. As a result,
    you have certain intellectual property rights for 10 or 15 years at least."

    necessarily true. Our government has a funny way of looking at things sometimes.
    In the late 60s or early 70s, for instance, they copyrighted every US postage
    stamp design dating all the way back to 1847.\r\n\r\nIt isn't too likely that
    they would raise much of a fuss about it though, so go for it."

    this point I need to loosen up the spacing and find the version of the font that
    had some kerning done\u2014I may have saved over it. I\u2019m also debating how
    to handle some of the pointy terminals that don\u2019t come to a hard point in
    my metal specimen. I think I\u2019ll switch them over sharp points as Coiner drew
    them. I might head over to the Library of Congress and sift through their NRA
    ephemera for more ideas to bring over from the hand-lettered stuff.\r\n\r\nBecause
    I see this as having little commercial value my plan is to release it (and my
    Fry\u2019s) under a Creative Commons like license. This will at least make it
    useful as a web font once the @font-face train pulls into some more stations,
    and hopefully be a decent self-promotion. What I want is a license that allows
    designers to use it without limits, but does not allow redistribution for profit. "
