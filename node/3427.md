body: I am currently doing design for a new womens weekly. As I have used GillSans
  troughout it &#40;had to choose something from Bitstream basic set of fonts <IMG
  SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0>&#40;
  &#41; I figured, to keep it simple, I could use it in masthead as well. However,
  the planned name of the mag is &#39;Marta&#39;, and the rt combination in Gill is
  as bad as it can get. So I tried to improve it. Does it look convincing? <BR> <BR>Before
  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27786.jpg" alt="">
  <BR> <BR>After <BR> <BR>And just how one gets access to start a new thread in the
  Design section?

  body: The change to the _lowercase r_ seems subtle enough, but the changes to the
    _lowercase t_ aren&#39;t quite right, althought I&#39;ve always wondered about
    the _lowercase t_ that is part of the font.  Maybe a little wider? Perhaps you
    could modify the _cap M_ too ... a little narrower?

  body: Try making the &#34;r&#34; beak and the &#34;t&#34; crossbar a single stroke
    or maybe slicing the &#34;r&#34; beak with the &#34;t&#34; diagonal that connects
    the stem with the crossbar on the top.

  body: Maija, since its a one word logo try crashing the letters together and where
    they overlap knockout the letter forms. This would make it a graphic and not type.
    It might be more interesting than redesigning the two characters.

  body: Gill Sans&#39;s ugliness &#40;I agree, Randy&#41; comes in large part from
    that &#34;a&#34;. Maija, I&#39;d say make a monocular &#34;a&#34; for the logo.
    Also, I like your new &#34;t&#34;, but the original &#34;r&#34; was better. Lastly,
    the &#34;M&#34; is too big and heavy - so you could try simply scaling it down
    a bit. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    in your mouth. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Kyle, a pity indeed, but I don&#39;t have syntax <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> All in all, I needed a sans family with many variations
    to use for many purposes &#40;regular, bold, xtrabold, condensed etc&#41; and
    had to choose basically from helvetica, frutiger, franklin, gill, eurostile, futura
    and zurich. as the first three are already terribly overused in our local press,
    and the latter three don&#39;t quite convey feeling of a womens magazine, I went
    for gill. Purchasing any new typefaces wasn&#39;t considered at all.  <BR> <BR>Hector,
    I really didn&#39;t want a beak on the r, as it makes it seem more like Manta
    &#40;which has a completely different meaning in our language :D &#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>I need a very clear, clean, simple masthead, as the mag is targeted to an
    average medium-low income woman of 25-55, city AND country &#40;hey, we have only
    about 1.5 mln women in total here &#40;including newborn babies&#41;, have to
    grab what we can&#41;, so I can&#39;t use anything any of them would consider
    &#39;modern&#39; or &#39;extreme&#39; or &#39;repelling&#39; or whatever. But
    I still want it to be well done. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I tried to follow Hrant&#39;s
    directions and here is what I came up with. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27978.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I liked the serifs of the &#39;a&#39;, as without them the &#39;a&#39;
    looked too &#39;futura&#39; type geometric, so I decided to leave them. Also the
    old &#39;r&#39; is back and the &#39;t&#39; is slashed to match the angle of the
    &#39;r&#39; &#40;mh.. still haven&#39;t learned the names of all those various
    letter parts <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
    BORDER=0> &#41;. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for advice <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'I like it. The tail on the &#34;a&#34; is great! Just the outside countour
    is shaky: bring the top&amp;bottom apexes to the right - flatten out the curves.
    <BR> <BR>Two more things: <BR>- The &#34;M&#34; is still too dark. <BR>- There&#39;s
    a huge gap between the &#34;r&#34; and &#34;t&#34;. In a sans there&#39;s not
    too much you can do, but try: making the &#34;r&#34; narrower; and giving the
    whole more letterspacing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Well this is much better, those lc &#34;a&#34; look very femmenine and handsome.
    I am wondering what if the &#34;M&#34; middle strokes touched the floor.
