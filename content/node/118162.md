  mix of features from Gotham (uniform widths) and Neutraface (pointed apexes), but
  obviously neither of those typefaces. Middle bars on \u2018E\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019
  are unusually long. "

    and /F crossbars, can't find anything to match it so may be customized for this
    feature only? Some alternatives for the moment: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mtt/milano|Milano
    MTT]], some [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/M-B_Creative|M-B Creative]], [[http://www.railfonts.com/cgi-bin/font_shop/fontshop.cgi?ACTION=enter&thispage=page10.html|CityOf]],

  body: I knew it was remembering something else... If this screen capture comes from
    Snowpiercer title sequence, here's the [[http://typophile.com/node/115652|previous
    discussion]] on the topic. Unfortunately, nobody identified it. My best guess
    [[http://www.dafont.com/telegrafico.font|Telegrafico]] with a custom /S (borrowed
    elsewhere? Akzidenz-Grotesk?).

    right. The hyphen was also from elsewhere as Telegrafico doesn\u2019t have one."
