body: Is it possible to create your own oblique font using the &#39;shear&#39; tool
  in illustrator? I am buying some helveticas for my PC from fonts.com and wonder
  if I need to buy the normal set as well as the oblique set in order to have an italic
  version to compliment the regular set.  <BR> <BR>If I buy the upright helvetica
  then apply a 6 degree shear using the transform tool in illustrator, will I end
  up with exactly the same font as helvetica oblique?  <BR> <BR>When they create an
  oblique version of a font is there some kind of compression or extension added as
  well as an angular tilt? <BR> <BR>Let me know if being cheap will comeback to haunt
  me later on..

  body: 'A mechanical oblique is deficient in two ways: <BR>1&#41; Its stroke contrast
    distribution is warped: the relationship between the horizontal and vertical parts
    of the letters is unnatural &#40;or at least unconventional&#41;. <BR>2&#41; Its
    structures are not sufficiently cursive, for example in the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;g&#34;.
    Some people think this is critical, others think it&#39;s not but it&#39;s still
    nice to have structural differences between the roman and italic, to help their
    differentiation when the latter is used for emphasis in a body of the former.
    <BR> <BR>The more you shear, the more #1 &#40;and maybe #2&#41; becomes an issue.
    I&#39;ve made a font with a ~3.58 degree shear, and it required minimal correction.
    Your 6 degrees is probably borderline. <BR> <BR>But the less you shear, the more
    #2 become important &#40;for differentiation&#41;. <BR> <BR>I guess saving money
    by making your own fake italics can make sense, but know that it&#39;s a compromise,
    not just in terms of craft quality but also function: a Helvetica slanted by only
    6 degrees will not function well in a body of the original upright font &#40;unless
    you also use a different weight, or less likely a [slightly] different size&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another idea: don&#39;t use italics. Let saving money be the
    trigger, but make ideology your justification, and use gentle weight gradations
    for emphasis instead - it&#39;s purer. Check out Typo magazine to see how that&#39;s

  body: Generally I agree with Hrant that mechanical obliques are deficient. However,
    in the case of Helvetica it should be noted that the usual Type 1 Helvetica package
    actually uses the slant function of Type 1 to make the italics, so you are actually
    paying for the same upright font twice, once with the slant set to the italic
    angle and once with it not.

  body: Yes, 12 degrees. <BR> <BR>When I was working on Helvetica Linotype, I had
    to make my own italics, because the Type 1 source data didn&#39;t exist. I corrected
    the curves slightly, but didn&#39;t want to differ too much from the sloped roman
    with which everyone was familiar.

  body: Thanks guys. I used Hrant&#39;s sugestion of emphasis through bolds and it
    worked really well. Thanks guys!
