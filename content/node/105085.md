body: "I am getting sick of FontExplorer, it keeps crashing on me. I don't know if
  the reason for the crashes are because I'm running a 64-bit OS (Windows 7 Professional)
  or not but it's become fairly annoying. So I'd like to switch to something else
  but I don't really know where to start. I did a Google search and there's been a
  whole crop of them that have popped up, which is amazing to me because I remember
  5 years ago Windows users would sell their souls for a good type management program.
  I haven't really been able to find any solid reviews of any of them, however, and
  a search through the archives has also turned up nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat do you folks
  use these days for type management programs? "
