    is an obvious reissue sometime later.\r\n\r\nHere's the full cover:\r\nhttp://manybooks.net/original_covers/f/fortc/fortc2247222472-8.jpg\r\n\r\nThe

    during the era of the Soviet Union. I think the Czechs were far more likely to
    be open to experimentation in letterforms and gutsy about implementing them. Veronika
    Burian gave an inspiring presentation at TypeCon '07 showing some very innovative
    examples of Czech work.\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/1225352194/in/photostream/\r\n\r\nChrisL"
