body: "i am in the process of designing a preparedness/survival manual intended to
  be a post-9/11, post-katrina guide for urbanites and suburbanites. the publisher
  would like this book to appeal to hipsters and families alike.\r\n\r\neach chapter
  contains numerous topic headings, which i have set in solex bold, 16pt.\r\n\r\ni
  really like the way this font looks in all caps, but when it is used for the sub-heads,
  it doesn't quite work.\r\nall caps is too overbearing and title case seems to be
  lacking something. perhaps there are ease-of-legibility problems with each.\r\n\r\nadditionally,
  i am using solex in the body copy as my bold font (which happens numerous times)
  and for picture captions.\r\n\r\n\r\ni would like a similarly condensed looking
  font that i can use for headers and will also work nicely for the sub-headers set
  in a smaller point size.\r\n\r\ni have attached 3 spreads for reference. let me
  know if it would be helpful to see additional pages or pages containing illustrations.\r\n\r\nalso,
  i am going to reduce the size of the bracket dingbats 10 pts or so.\r\n\r\nthanks
  very much for any insight you can provide.\r\n\r\ngregg"

  body: I would suggest looking at a new font for your body copy, and using the bold
    weight of that font (instead of solex) within the body copy and for your subheads.
    I don't know if you're stuck with Helvetica, but it doesn't do much for the page
    in my opinion.

    body: "yeah, i know what you mean.\r\n\r\ni chose helvetica because i was looking
      at various kinds of manuals and guidebooks for reference and wanted something
      very no-nonsense that perhaps made reference to those \"under-designed\" books.\r\n\r\ndo
      you think something like meta is a better choice? i'm just not sure."

  body: Legato would be better than Helvetica if you wanted a neutral sans for text.
