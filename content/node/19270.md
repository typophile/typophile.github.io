    Script</a> and <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/contributors/chuckdavis/sofiascript.shtml\">Sofia

    target=\"_blank\">these auto racing game fonts.</a>\r\nAlso, I know the designer
    who designed the attached file. I think \"Racing\" is hand drawn. If you are interested
    in the attached file, I can try to find out if it is a font by chance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/racing_head.gif]"
