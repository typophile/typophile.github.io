<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi!
Critiques welcome, but mainly I'm just showing off my new favorite logo of mine! This is for Love Garden records, an indie record label I've been asked to art direct for. Hope you like it and please tell me if something looks off.

<div class=commentbody>It's very "now". I like it, but you may need to do a redesign in 2 years or so because it will probably look dated by then.

<div class=commentbody>I see what you're saying. What's funny is to me it looks very 1960s. If was afraid people would think it's needed a redesign for 40 years already.

<div class=commentbody>Beautiful watercolor, feels very indie too. Unfortunately when I scrolled down and saw the vector version, I didn't get the same reaction. Maybe because of the order I saw it in. Maybe you bring some of that watercolor texture into the logo, but in a simpler way.
Otherwise, bravo. </div>

<div class=commentbody>The G in Garden is problematic. As some of the letters are caps and some are lower case I thingk the G should be a cap. It's hard to read.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the feedback! I think I can answer Sharon and logosam simultaneously.
The reason I'm not going to use either suggestions (though they are both really good ones), is because I like the fact that the seemingly abstract symbol for the love garden is in truth the o,v,g, and a of the name. Typically we'd expect "LG" to be the wordmark, but instead it uses other letters in the name to create a symbol that to me feels both "mod" and arcane/alchemical/psychedelic--which is the "big idea."
here's the tilt:

Here's the symbol by itself:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/symbol_4856.jpg]
and here's an example of it in use:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tshirt_6218.jpg]
I just REALLY dig that.

<div class=commentbody>I'm OK with this. I don't have the same worries about it being dated. It's strong, but simple at the same time.
Also, I love the watercolor as well. Hand made? The 'g' alone might be an issue but in the context of the word as a whole, it seems to read just fine.
As a poster, I think the elements work great together. As a logo, I think the wordmark stands best on it's own without the duplicated enlarged circle and triangle elements.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul--this was all done by "hand" in illustrator. No typeface, though inspired by many.
Aluminum--thanks for the feedback! The watercolor was made by printing the design up on my inkjet and then spraying it with a water bottle as it came out! Nice, right. I'll use that trick again... And thanks for the kind words, I love it as well. Unfortunately, the project is sort of heading into a ditch that is out of my control. But hey, you do what you can!

<div class=commentbody>Really nice! I was just wondering why, in the symbol, the "g" is placed higher than in the logotype? Feels more balanced with the triangles the other way..
And thanks for the watercolor trick! I'll have to try that some day..</div>

<div class=commentbody>I just thought it looked better. Not a very insightful answer, but I thought it looked a bit more arcane/symbolic than the more perfectly matched version of taking the letters directly from the logotype.
Just don't spray water <em>into</em> your printer!

<div class=commentbody>You designed the logotype yourself? That's really something, I've seen it before around Belfast and it seems to be taking off with a lot of nightclubs / electronica artists.
Congratulations!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Paul--I didn't create a typeface-you give me too much credit! I just drew these 8 letters based on dozens of typefaces I've been seeing allot of myself! The blown-out deco-inspired thing is definitely big right now...but it was in the 60s as well which is where I stole most of my inspiration--sixties fantasy novels.
I created this logotype, but if you want a full features typeface I'd just poke around veer. They have 4 or 5 like this including the new <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000298&WT.ac=type.080301.1.img.strand">DF Strand</a> which is pretty cool.
