  cards using the same layout, and then 1 'blank' lot, so that blank will have a slightly
  different layout.\r\n\r\nWould you build this as an InDesign file, or would you
  save them all as separate Illustrator files?\r\n\r\nI usually do biz cards in Illustrator,
  but with many lots, it gets cumbersome.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Illustrator using the variable features (pull data from an XML source so you
    can rapidly use one design to create cards for many individuals). But I think
    I'd do that mostly because I'm more familiar with Illustrator as far as card layout
    and printing goes.

  body: I'd say InDesign too, but it's also worth asking the printer how they would
    like the files prepared. They might want a separate pdf for each card in which
    case it doesn't matter which program you use.
