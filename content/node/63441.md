    American Typewriter]], with some distortion, and crammed tracking. Oddly, not
    all version of this font have an italic.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    of itc American typewriter so I didn't really know there was one. I've had a look
    at it and if that's what this is made from it's been changed a lot... maybe it
    was skewed and the serif on the p was customized?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDom"

    pretty close to lacrima.\r\n\r\nCheers, Dom"

  body: "Lacrima doesn't have a way to see all the letters, so it's hard to be sure.
    Part of my thinking is also that American Typewriter is way more well-known and
    has been around for a long time, while Lacrima is found only at a small Swiss
    web site. P22 Remington doesn't seem to match very well, judging from the 'c'
    and 'a' shapes in the italic. I'm putting my money on the ITC font (with distortion).\r\n\r\n
