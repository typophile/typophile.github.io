  body: "Good find Aaron. Interesting to see what Adobe has to say about the OCR fonts\r\n---start
    quote---\r\nIn 1968, American Type Founders produced OCR-A, one of the first optical
    character recognition typefaces to meet the criteria set by the U.S. Bureau of
    Standards.\r\nThe design is simple so that it can be read by a machine, but it
    is slightly more difficult for the human eye to read. OCR-A follows the 1981 standard
    set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), X-3.17-1981 (size I).
    The same design is also specified for the German DIN 66008 standard. OCR-B was
    designed in 1968 by Adrian Frutiger for Monotype.\r\nThis design pushes the limits
    of the optical reader, but is easier for people to read. OCR-B\u2019s construction
    follows the ISO 1073/II-1976 (E) standard, with 1979 corrections (letterpress
    design, size I). Both OCR-A and OCR-B have \u201Calternate\u201D versions, which
    have the standard ISO-Adobe character set instead of the more limited OCR character
    set.\r\n---end quote---\r\nDon"
