  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A friend of mine is gonna start a new international company in The Netherlands. He hired a freelance designer to design his corporate identity. Today he showed me the results, now I looked at it, and the type looked like a font from a know foundry. Although it looks almost the same as shape, but his curves and style is more condensed than the original font. I have seen the process of building it in steps he saved as pdf. He really designed it himself.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now my friend is wondering if he can get accused for breaking copyrights, as it looks the same, but in details it isn't the same. Who knows? As I couldn't give him a right answer, but he's still in doubt, as I mentioned it looked like a known font from a commercial type foundry. Who knows about laws and copyright? In my eyes it is possible that someone in japan makes something similar looking like someone in europe&hellip; But I was just wondering too how court would handle this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who knows?</div>
