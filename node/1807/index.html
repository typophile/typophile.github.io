		<div class="commentbody">Tanya, the vast majority of Amerindian peoples north of Mexico had no writing systems at the time of contact, so I suggest you give up trying to find something that conveys 'First Peoples': it would be just one more imposition of artificial, non-Native preconceptions on Native culture. Also, consider that Native peoples do not consider themselves to be a homogenous mass: they belong to different ethnic groups, tribes, civilisations, and to what, in post-contact parlance, they came to identify as different nations. So you should consider which Native people are referred to in the exhibit, and consider with whom they were in contact. Then you might well find that using a contemporary European typeface might be the most appropriate choice: one of the significant achievements of many colonised peoples around the world has been to take the script and language of the colonial power and to redeploy it with their own messages. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is a thought: in English language typography it is conventional to use italics for words in foreign languages. So you could play on the accepted conventions of the people attending the exhibit, and put the messages of Native peoples in roman type &ndash; i.e. make it the norm &ndash; and the European text in italics.</div>

If editors decide to use italic for italic reasons and then Euro is italic too, things might get confusing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, YES&hellip;if there were a font that was created by someone of native background at least from the 1800s or a modern face that showed influence from the archives that followed latin characters I'd be all over it&hellip;but my search bore no results&hellip;would be super happy if you or someone could suggest one? and yes, I need a soft copy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update: I think I might have a replacement through Nick Shinn that maybe more appropriate&hellip;we'll see.

		<div class="commentbody">I've been involved with Native American publications since the late 80s. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since there is no true Native type free from European influence, you should concentrate on good design choices for any historical museum exhibit. The Native and European text should feel equal. Any self-conscious treatment of the Native languages will get you no closer to a true Native typography, and may appear to some to be condescending and racist. So, handwritten, distressed, or otherwise quirky fonts should be ruled out unless you are also using them for the French/English. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with John Hudson about trying italic &amp; roman to differentiate between the cultures. The odd word or two needing to be &quot;italicized&quot; in blocks of italic text should be set in roman. If you weren't tied to using period faces, a carefully selected serif / sans serif combination would work well. Again, nothing quirky. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's such a wide variety of styles in Native American art. I wish we could see the exhibits you are designing for.</div>

When  things like native-esque styled Olympic icons, and the Aboriginal Television network logo are going, the public gets it, and nobody's said they were condescending.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->See, I was thinking the other way around. My opinion was that if the rest of the place has matching period faces and mine dosen't that that would be condescending to the point where some might suggest there was little to no understanding or consideration of their styles. By using a European face we are showing that their words are only heard through our voice, and that's especially bad when its written in the 1st person. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is why I thought of using a handwritten face, because it would show a difference in lifestyles at least - one that had machines, has type, letterpress ect&hellip;.and one that used their hands.

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with trying to find an authentic &quot;Native style&quot; is that there is none. Even if public opinion isn't a concern, any attempt to find one is likely to be contrived. It's not a matter of political correctness. Even if someone is overly sensitive to what Natives will think, it'll still end up &quot;fake&quot; if they try too hard to find something Native. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, the real problem for this museum exhibit is finding two clearly contrasting faces which go well together and fit the time period covered. The Native aspect is a bit of a red herring. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was overreacting a bit when I suggested staying away from handwritten forms. It's just that I've seen people choose primitive looking styles when trying to &quot;be native&quot;. In general, the writing samples I've seen from literate Natives are in the handwriting style of their era. Cursives are not unauthentic. I have seen child-like writing from barely literate Natives, but it is no different than what you would see from poorly educated Euro-Americans from the same era.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">well of course the Euros would have some poor writting skills too. I was talking about the big picture and representing the &quot;communication&quot; logistics of an entire culture.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basic facts: Euros having the printing press in full action versus the first peoples who communicate with hand written (carved what-have-you)  As well, considering we're talking &quot;First Peoples&quot; and the very first interactions between Euros and natives - I don't think that cursive hand writting is what happened next&hellip;basic letterforms, sticks and circles perhaps.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Either way I sometimes think its strange that we've become so politically correct that no one thinks it would be proper to use those faces that we may refer to as child-like or whimsical letterforms for the first peoples when that's excatly what they probably looked like wihen the first colonized groups tried to learn how to write latin characters.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if we want to show a written piece that's more evolved than that, we call it cheesy and perhaps offensive to show any latin form that tries to give back any teeny bit of credence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see where if it were about preserving a culture how it would be offensive, but this is about the colonization of north america - The first nations getting their rights and lands back happens in *this* century not 14-1500s.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is being politically correct really just trying to hide facts of what was done in order to promote happy origins all over? Is it about  saving confusion among the idiots who can't see what the problems were.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would never think that examples of Native writting in latin forms had any basis to exist per say, but it was part of an evolution&hellip;You can't ignore that it did happen. Some how, some way - the first peoples did learn to write in english and french language using latin forms. There were some steps before perfecting the latin forms that I would suspect had lingering elements of various native structures - but I guess its offensive to represent those steps and see any kind of merge? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a modern (latin) face with native elements (considering evolution worked the other way around): wouldn't the resulting kitch be the highest form of flattery, and show a very respectful appreciation ,&hellip;without all the PC crap, if you look at it this way the recipients could be humbled by such attempt. Perhaps we all hate the idea simply because we see it as an assumption of style, when we are the style masters.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyway - that's my tangent of the day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
