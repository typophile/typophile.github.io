  posted it's Top Type for 2005 which shows the 18 \"<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=264\"
  target=\"new\">hottest faces</a>\" selected by its customers.\r\n\r\nEven Veer humorously
  notes that a few aren't even scripts.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I feel it's always good
  to give your customer base feedback like this. Holding up the mirror to your shoppers
  and letting them know what most of them (I assume) bought does in fact reshape the
  mindset for the next purchase. Some will jump on the bandwagon and buy a script,
  some will jump off and try another typestyle next time. \r\n\r\nRemember, <em>Top</em>
  doesn't necessarily mean <em>best</em> when merchandising, and it's ALWAYS nice
  to have some top sellers."

  body: A very simple way to differentiate yourself is with type. To most -- and this
    is conjecture -- all they see is the display stuff. They don't understand that
    the type which isn't sterotypical display can just as strongly differentiate as
    that which is. I don't think it is a negative thing, just a real situation.

    houses consisting mostly of neutral sans faces?</em>\r\n\r\nIt depends how you
    calculate a sale, I think.\r\n\r\nFor instance, say that Foundry X has a standard
    EULA, which is good for 10 workstations. Foundry X only has two fonts in its library,
    Script Face 123 and Grotesque 567. Foundry X sells 100 transactions of Script
    Face 123 and 50 transactions of Grotesque 567 per month via its online store.\r\n\r\nTechnically,
    Script Face 123 is the foundry's best seller, right? Not necessarily. Lets say
    that all of the Script Face 123 transactions were with the standard, 10 user license.
    But half of the Grotesque 567 transactions were for more workstations\u2026 anywhere
    from 11 to 11,000.\r\n\r\nNow Grotesk 567 is the foundry's best seller, because
    it licensed the most workstations in a single month, even though it had less single
    transactions via the store.\r\n\r\nYou should always ask yourself which numbers
    you're looking at in top-N lists."

    base of the foundry. Do customers who frequent Veer go there because they are
    looking for display or script faces more than customers of LinoType go there for
    text or sans faces? I am not saying that this is true, I am just posing the question.
    Personally, if I were looking for a sans, I would be more likely to look at FF
    than Veer or P22. If I am looking for something pushing the envelope, I would
    more likely look at Storm than at LinoType. Maybe size ane age of foundry matters
    too. It would be interesting to see breakdowns by foundry and how they measure
    (taking in Dan's comments).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    lists are based on real data. There are two categories of 20, text and headline.
    At least 16 of the headline fonts are scripts (and if Papyrus and Old English
    can be considered script fonts, that 18 of 20 are scripts). I wouldn't say that
    Linotype's customers visit the website only looking for sans serif fonts, or even
    for serious fonts at all. How different is the headline top 20 from a list at
    Veer? Maybe Veer's fonts were designed more recently, and maybe Veer's customers
    go in for a more grungy look. I'd be interested to know where Veer's customers
    come from, too, i.e., what percentage of the customer base is North American versus
    other continents and countries. I'd bet the the \"rough look\" is more in at certain
    places than others.\r\n\r\nCompare the current top seller list with another Linotype
    Feature: 2005's favorites\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/8-2628-8/favouritefonts2005.html\">http://www.linotype.com/8-2628-8/favouritefonts2005.html</a>\r\nYear
    round rather than up-to-the minute. The \"business fonts\" don't differ too much,
    but the \"casual\" ones do. Not as many scripts here. At other parts of the year,
    it seems that other types of display type were popular, too. Which fonts sell
    most when might have something to do with what fonts are marketed when. I bet
    that MyFonts.com would witness similar trends.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of MyFonts.com,
    here is their best seller list, which is updated daily:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/bestsellers.html\">http://www.myfonts.com/bestsellers.html</a>\r\nWhat
    better way to get instant feedback on who is buying which fonts. Like Linotype.com,
    two Linotype fonts top this list as well, Zapfino and Neue Helvetica. From today's
    top-50, 22 are scripts, 18 are sans serifs, 5 are serif faces, 3 are \"other\"
    (sorry for the over-generalization here), and two are ornaments/symbol fonts.
    The sans serifs licensed here are not so different from the sans serifs licensed
    at Linotype.com\r\n\r\nFontShop keeps charts as well. I like these, because FontShops
    operate locally. It isn't easy to visit another country's FontShop, i.e., if you
    are in Germany, you have to enter in a FontShop USA's URL twice before the site
    will even open, because of automatic re-direct.\r\nHere is FontShop Germany's
    Top 25:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Fprodtips.php3%3Fns%3D10%26sns%3D1%3Cbr%20/%3E\">http://www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Fprodtips.php3%3Fns%3D10%26sns%3D1%3Cbr%20/%3E</a>\r\nOf
    the 25, only four are scripts\u2014exactly the bottom four (the best, P22 Cezanne,
    comes in at place 22). Only 2 serif faces on this list. Of the top 25, 7 come
    from FontShop Internation or Font Shop (one is only labeled \"FontShop\"; I thought
    that all FontShop fonts were from FontShop Internation (FSI)?). 17 are from other
    foundry's. Like I already said, I really like this list, because it seems to say
    a lot. Namely, Germans who license fonts from FontShop like sans serifs. They
    don't necessarially prefer FSI's own typefaces, but they still buy from FontShop,
    rather than going to another site like Linotype's or Monotype's or MyFonts, where
    many fonts are even cheaper because of exchange rates and taxes and other things.
    Does the lack of script strength say anything about German tastes? Maybe Germans
    don't like script fonts as much as Americans do? Maybe they do like them, but
    get them at Veer, or for free from Free Font download sites?\r\n\r\nDoes the SF
    site, FontShop.com, have a top seller list, too? They have really pretty e-mail
    newsletters.\r\n\r\nMonotype's Fonts.com website has a Top Ten:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Top10.htm\">http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Top10.htm</a>\r\nOf
    these 10, there are no scripts, just 9 sans serifs and 1 serif."

  body: "Best seller lists are more revealing about single-font trends, and scripts
    tend to be single.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at Myfonts, a single sale of a large font
    family to a multi-user licence would not register on the top 50, but if they did
    things by dollar value, or multiplied the number of fonts in the package by the
    number of licences users, then it probably would.\r\n\r\nVeer promoted my new
    typeface Nicholas last year, with a full page in their catalog, and with a front-page
    main banner ad online. It's a serif design (the category trailing scripts and
    sans), and I think we're both happy with the resulting sales, although it didn't
    make the top 18 (BTW, why not 20, was #19 unmentionable?)"

    we only featured 18 top typefaces, because our thumbnail display grid is divisible
    by 6. It makes for a tidier presentation. I suppose we could have bumped it up
    to the top 24 faces, but then it would open up the discussion to 'what happened

    not multi-seat or multi-device licensing.\r\n"
