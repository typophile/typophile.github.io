body: "I'm having to build a few \"ccmp\" glyphs for setting Kiowa. I seem to remember
  that the order of specifying diacriticals in Unicode is \"inside out\", starting
  with the top.\r\n\r\nOK, no problem, the name for an \"oh\" with a macron & and
  acute above is, for example,\r\n\r\nuni006F03040301 (or shorter, uni01010301)\r\n\r\nBut
  when you add the macron below as well, is it preferable to work \"inside out\" regardless
  of position, so the glyph name would be\r\n\r\nuni010103310301 (omacron, macronbelow
  combining, acute combining),\r\n\r\nor take care of the top first, e.g.\r\n\r\nuni010103010331
  (omacron, acute combining, macronbelow combining)\r\n\r\nI suppose at some level
  it doesn't mater, but if there is a convention I'd like to follow it, because for
  all I know, either the text file or the PDf may be repurposed.\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "The a\u0331\u0304\u0301 character can be expressed in a two main canonical
    Unicode forms. The Normalization Form D (NFD), which is achieved by the complete
    canonical decomposition of the string: \r\n<code>U+0061 U+0331 U+0304 U+0301</code>\r\nand
    the Normalization Form C (NFC), which is achieved by the complete canonical decomposition
    and a subsequent canonical composition of the string: \r\n<code>U+0101 U+0331
    U+0301</code>\r\n\r\nWhen creating glyphnames for characters such as a\u0331\u0304\u0301
    glyph, I recommend converting the Unicode sequence to the NFC form (on the Mac,
    you can use Unicode Checker for that), so a sensible glyphname would be <code>uni010103310301</code>.
    \r\n\r\nYour <code>ccmp</code> code would be then: \r\n<code>sub amacron uni0331
    acutecomb by uni010103310301;</code>\r\n\r\nHowever, since many application don't
    perform Unicode normalization of the string, your ccmp code could also add code
    for other situations: \r\n<code>sub amacron acutecomb uni0331 by uni010103310301;\r\nsub
    aacute uni0304 uni0331 by uni010103310301;\r\nsub aacute uni0331 uni0304 by uni010103310301;\r\nsub
    a acutecomb uni0304 uni0331 by uni010103310301;\r\nsub a acutecomb uni0331 uni0304
    by uni010103310301;\r\nsub a uni0331 uni0304 acutecomb by uni010103310301;\r\nsub
    a uni0331 acutecomb uni0304 by uni010103310301;\r\nsub a uni0304 uni0331 acutecomb
    by uni010103310301;\r\nsub a uni0304 acutecomb uni0331 by uni010103310301;</code>\r\n\r\nMore
