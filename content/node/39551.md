body: When you are in classes where other people may "doodle" out of boredom, do you
  ever doodle type? If you're out of school, as most people here probably are, did
  you doodle type like this when you were in school?

  body: I was the queen of doodling in class, got busted a bunch (once memorably for
    drawing a nasty caricature of my french teacher) and luckily had one teacher who
    realized that doodling helped me concentrate. I DID doodle type sometimes and
    still do when I'm on the phone.

  body: "I have a really difficult time not doodling in meetings.\r\n\r\nMy notes
    start off business-like enough, but soon degenerate into stream of consciousness
    doodling often some lettering or type based images, simply because it evolves
    out of what ever I was writing.  \r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
