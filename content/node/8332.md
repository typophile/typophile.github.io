  an earlier post about a &#34;scammish&#34; online certificate. What about the real
  deal? I&#39;ve seen a lot of info on Visual Communications programs. What do you
  think?  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my situation:  I have 129 credit hours that somehow
  never added up to a degree. I was offered a killer marketing job that I couldn&#39;t
  pass up and pledged to finish my degree in advisertising at a local college. Well,
  five years and much success later, I never finished. I&#39;ve managed to do very
  well professionally without the degree, but would like it for my own personal satisfaction.
  Honestly, most of my peers have no idea I don&#39;t have a degree -- it&#39;s unlikely
  that someone without one would have my job &#40;I&#39;ve been lucky, I guess&#41;.
  Anyway, the program I&#39;m looking into is a B.S. and is accredited by the same
  place as several art schools.  Everything seems legit. Thoughts?  <BR> <BR>P.S.
  I can&#39;t stand the thought of stepping foot on an actual campus, so please don&#39;t
  let that suggestion override your response.'

  body: Look at the accrediting body itself. That&#39;s what makes it legit. Then
    look at the other schools they&#39;ve accredited and how they&#39;re rated against
    name schools like Parsons, RISD, etc. The schools don&#39;t have to be first tier,
    but should be recognized by the profession. It would help if you could get some
    advice from a reputable grad program, would they accept the online certificate
    or not? It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re going to grad school or not, it&#39;s
    just a way of getting a handle on how people view the online program. <BR> <BR>If
    you have 129 hours you should have gotten a degree, so I assume you weren&#39;t
    anywhere long enough to earn one. Most brick and mortar schools require residency
    in the program before granting a degree so you would be stuck doing another year
    at a minimum, maybe two. Not fair, but that&#39;s the system.

    previously earned ones and they often have distance learning options &#40;online&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>So if it&#39;s for personal satisfaction, then that&#39;d be fine. <BR>
    <BR>If it&#39;s to improve your resume, alas, at least in this industry, the name
    of the school is rather important, and I don&#39;t think any online art school
    has the same cachet as a brick and mortar would.
