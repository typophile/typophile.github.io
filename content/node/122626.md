  body: "<blockquote>The 9 doesnt match with DIN</blockquote>\r\nYou're right that's
    why I said \"that's very DIN\" and not \"that's DIN\" :)\r\nAnd to me, main issue
    with DIN is probably with /S which looks very different on your sample. That's
    probably a custom cut of DIN, exclusive for Pakistan car plates and not available
    commercially."
