  body: Great, Hannes! I wish it had RSS. There are so many blogs it's important to
    have an RSS feed so people can follow your updates.

  body: "Thanks Stephen, that's good feedback. So now we do have a feed:\r\n\r\nwww.typedu.org/dynamic/TypEduFeed/\r\n\r\n...which
    still sucks because the text doesn't get clipped and the links show up wrong.
    I'm not sure what I am doing wrong but I'll try to fix it asap. We're still in
    late beta I'm afraid.\r\n:)"
