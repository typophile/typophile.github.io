  manually (only using the table). The kerning sections also is locked. I tried checking
  and un checking every button in the Layers panel and it does not solve the problem.\r\nI
  also changed the workspace and this didn't help either.\r\nI am going Crazy. Any
  idea on how to unlock it?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

    when I started using a different file. In the end I had to generate an OT font,
    open it and save it as a FL file again. Now the metric window is working fine
