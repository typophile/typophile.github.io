body: "I'm going on 24 hours of no sleep and I don't even have any more Diet-Pepsi
  to drink - so please bear with me if I don't make much sense.\r\n\r\nI have a new
  website under development - through a contract company that I found on eLance (based
  out of the UK and India) - and we've just completed the 'framework' or phase one.
  \ Now I have to provide detailed content, graphic images, color choices as well
  as a logo and a type face choices.\r\n  \r\nThe business is a (niche real estate/referral
  service) and I want the website to give potential clients (seller's and agents -
  basically) the sense that they've come to the right place - that the company is
  capable of handling their problems - nationwide and that we are in some way - different
  (unique) in a way that makes us their obvious choice.\r\n\r\nI know that's a lot
  to ask for a type face - but I thought I'd throw it our here to the community anyhow.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached an example of the 'template' we are going to use as a basis and tweak until
  satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere will be various content on the home pages, including Articles,
  Announcements, Images, etc, as well as Larger Single Word Typefaces which may be
  located on top of a graphic image, which may be used as a link (one for each prospect
  type)inviting agents and sellers into their own special sub-sites.  \r\n\r\nShould
  the content inside the frames (articles, about us, etc) have a different typeface
  then the links and menu items and other verbiage around the edges of the site -
  like here in Typohile?\r\n\r\nShould the typeface be consistent across all subsites
  - even if one prospect does not have access to another prospects 'registered' subsite?\r\n\r\nRegarding
  the Logo - There are 3 Short Words of almost equal length XXXX XXXXX XXXXX - but
  the last two words are codependent and cannot/should not stand alone, whereas the
  first word can. \r\n\r\nI'd reveal the actual name - but I think I'd be in violation
  of a non-disclosure agreement I signed - so for now I'll just say the predominant
  letters are S's & O's (see next: Oxxx SxOxx SxxxS).\r\n\r\nI've looked into RayTracing
  and PaintProgram Type modication - to make the logo look more interesting than standard
  lettering and some flat 'clip-art' image  (which is what the web development company
  came up with so far.)  \r\n\r\nIs it true that not all typefaces are good in websites
  because not all browsers can read them?  \r\n\r\nDoes this apply to a typeface that's
  been turned into a graphic image such as a logo or a menu item?  \r\n\r\nThis is
  really hard.  Sorry for so many questions.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nHeidi\r\n\r\n"
