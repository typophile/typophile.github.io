  the future might regard Emigre as pioneers into digital typography. Common knowledge
  puts Emigre, led by wife and husband duo [[Zuzana Licko]] and [[Rudy Vanderlans]]
  at the forefront of the digital foundry era. The foundry got its start in 1984 when
  Zuzana designed a series of bitmap fonts for the new Macintosh from [[Apple Computer]].
  For nearly two decades Emigre put out [[Emigre Magazine]], a monthly publication
  of the same name, with thoughtful essays and articles aimed to stir up dialogue
  and of course drive sales of their typefaces.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.emigre.com"
