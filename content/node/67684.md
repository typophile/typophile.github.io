  But I am looking to get more detailed information on each.\r\n\r\nThe types I am
  currently working with are: Heavy Caslon, Clearface Bold, Cheltenham Wide and Bold.
  \r\n\r\nWhat I am looking to gather in regards to information is: \r\n\r\n-Who designed
  them\r\n-Who producted them\r\n-What were they commonly used for\r\n-When were they
  popular\r\n-Any other links or sources that may be out there to help me with this.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in Advance!"

    then you could just copy and paste into a document. \r\nHey presto! ready made
    essay compiled by the experts. 10/10. Well done!\r\n\r\nWhen I was at college
    we actually had to use a library, that is soooo last century."

  body: "Thanks for the post, actually this project is very interesting. We started
    out with only the physical type, which we had to identify as I have above. Then
    I did a lot of research online and was able to find most of the basics I need,
    but the above questions and the more important details aren't just on the internet
    for me to find. I do have some books that I plan to review, but I was told by
    my Prof that this website was an excellent and friendly place to get help with
    information about the types that we aren't able to find on our own. \r\n\r\nGuess
    I will have to try somewhere else to get the information I need."
