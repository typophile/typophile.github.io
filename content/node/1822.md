  body: Well, the two &#34;h&#34;s are different. <BR>I&#39;d say this is a lettering
    job. <BR> <BR>There are similar typefaces though, just look for <BR>condensed
    slab serifs, like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/egyptienne-2/" target="_blank">
    this</a>, for example.

  body: Misa, I think its a typeface modifying the serif on the h would take less
    than 2 minutes in Illustrator. That font seems so familuar. Dan
