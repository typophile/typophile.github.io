  I had the idea of present all the information as it is on those flip displays on
  airports. I thought maybe some dot matrix kind of font but I think I want some more
  mechanic look, more towards Alpha Headline. But that's too round for my taste.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any suggestion?\r\nWould appreciate any input.\r\n\r\n"

    looking more for \"mechanic\" look. Sorry if I was unclear in my description.
    I wanna compare the dot matrix against another one.\r\n\r\nThanks."
