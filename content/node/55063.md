  sign is just all over the place. There's kerning issues in almost every word, extra
  bold capital letters paired with bold cap letters, and the words do not have a proper
  baseline. The more you look at it the more problems you find. It's kind of annoying
  to look at after a few minutes.\r\n\r\nMegaflicks sign\r\n[[http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e57/davemathew76/megaflicks.jpg]]\r\nThis
  is a video store sign. The picture is pixelated, but I just thought this example
  of bad type was funny. There's terrible kerning that makes the letters too close
  together to spell something else. Check it out.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I love the Fish Factory sign. It''s typographic folk art, and it''s a great
    example of what someone can do who has no training and few tools (a lettering
    template in three sizes: large, colossal, and humongous), but who has imagination
    and knows exactly what message he/she wants to communicate. When I see a that
    sign, I think, "I want to eat here."'
