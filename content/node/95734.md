  to me, and a few days trying to piece together a messy collection of hyperlinks
  and pages, I prepared the following article review. And as far as bullshit goes,
  a good scientist can\u2019t say that. It was just a hook. In order to support or
  refute the claims of this study you would need access to the same materials and
  data. Have at it Nick. I know how much you love the role of science in the practice
  of typography ;)\r\n\r\n<strong>In one sentence</strong>\r\nA short passage set
  in the typeface Baskerville was found to be more believable than the same passage
  set in five other typefaces.\r\n\r\n<strong>APA citation</strong>\r\nE. Morris.

  did they change?</strong>\r\nTypeface\r\n\r\n<strong>What typefaces did they use?</strong>\r\nBaskerville\r\nComputer
  Modern\r\nComic Sans\r\nTrebuchet\r\nHelvetica\r\nGeorgia\r\n\r\n<strong>What did
  they measure?</strong>\r\nReader\u2019s agreement or disagreement with a statement
  about a passage.\r\nReader\u2019s confidence with their agreement or disagreement.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who
  did they test?</strong>\r\nReaders of The New York Times blog: The Opinion Pages\r\n~10,000
  people clicked on the article.\r\n~50,000 people took the quiz.\r\n45,524 data sets
  were used for statistical analysis.\r\nNo demographic data was reported.\r\n\r\n<strong>Experimental
  design</strong>\r\nUnknown. It is not reported if subjects took the test more than
  once \u2014 \u201CIf you have taken it before, please take it again.\u201D (Morris,
  2012). As such, a repeated-measures mixed-subjects design is most likely.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why
  did they do this?</strong>\r\nTo determine if typeface influences the believability
  of a passage of text.\r\n\r\n<strong>What did they do?</strong>\r\nSubjects read
  a 368 word blog post on The New Your Times blog, The Opinion Pages. Within the post
  was an 80 word passage about an asteroid\u2019s near collision with Earth. Through
  use of a computer program, the passage within the post was presented in one of six
  different typefaces: Baskerville, Computer Modern, Comic Sans, Trebuchet, Helvetica,
  and Georgia. At the end of the post readers were asked two questions; One, if they
  agreed or disagreed with a claim in the passage \u201C\u2026we live in an era of
  unprecedented safety\u2026\u201D and a second, asking how strongly they agreed or
  disagreed with the claim.\r\n\r\n<strong>What did they find?</strong>\r\nSubjects
  found the passage set in the typeface Baskerville to be more believable than compared
  to the other five other typefaces.\r\n\r\n<strong>What does this mean?</strong>\r\nIf
  the simple act of taking the time to choose an appropriate typeface has the potential
  to influence readers\u2019 perception of your credibility, perhaps it would behoove
  you to case the joint before you B & E.\r\n\r\n<strong>Observations</strong>\r\nDespite
  the number of datasets analyzed, given that the test was administered online, it
  is not possible to determine how many individual actually actually took the test.
  Especially given Morris\u2019 (2012) request in the original post \u201CIf you have
  taken it before, please take it again.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe passage itself is also very
  short at 80 words. This  and there is the possible confound of an interaction between
  typeface and content. For example, if Comic Sans could be the winner if the passage
  was about clowns.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, objective measures of human performance
  such as time to read, and comprehension accuracy, were not reported, making it difficult
  to determine the validity of subjects\u2019 responses.\r\n\r\nOf special note, data
  analyst David Dunning of the Department of Psychology of Cornell University admirably
  acknowledged several potential criticisms of this study in his statement \u201CYou
  are collecting these data in an uncontrolled environment (who knows, for example
  just how each person\u2019s computer is rendering each font, how large the font
  is, is it on an iPad or iPhone, laptop or desktop), are their kids breaking furniture
  in the background, etc. So to see any difference is impressive.\u201D By this he
  means that in an uncontrolled environment, the fact that everyone is using a different
  device, has a different education, speaks a different language &c could potentially
  nullify the effects of changing the typeface. In this case, it did not. And Dunning\u2019s
  (2012) lay-person description of statistical analysis is one of the best plain-language
  examples I have ever seen. I look forward to reading follow-up studies.\r\n\r\nYou
  wouldn\u2019t happen to have an extra $30,000.00 of grant money kicking around would
  you?\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n<strong>Further reading</strong>\r\nBrumberger,

    that the population was not controlled?  \r\n\r\nWhile I agree, it\u2019s an uncontrolled
    population, this does give the study a higher degree of external or ecological
    validity. And as far as typography + psychology studies go, 50,000 Ss is <strong>huge</strong>
    in my books. Good or bad, it\u2019s certainly noteworthy. \r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I find the length of the passage (80 words) and the number, and nature of the
    questions, \u2014 2 questions, 1 yes/no, 1 three point Likert scale \u2014 to
    be of greatest concern. Combine that with the design noise around the test portion,
    and it gets even messier. Below you see the full post (shown at 50% of what I
    saw it as on <em>my</em> machine) with a red line around test portion (the part
    where they change the font. The rest remained unchanged). IMO, that\u2019s a pretty
    damn small portion.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bar_full_s_3817.jpg]"

  body: "\"?..do you mean the fact that the population was not controlled?\"\r\n\r\nNot
    exactly. I mean I'd rather know nothing about the subjects than not to know the
    researchers have screwed up something fundamental typographically.\r\n\r\nI would
    share your concerns for the surroundings and the portion, but that there is nothing
    about this test that claims it's about visually insulated long-passage immersive
    reading, is there? \r\n\r\nBut I think the most important thing about the study
    is as follows... About 25 years ago, Adobe tried to strip the postscript-using
    world of its free font choice. They had a couple 100 fonts and, via licensing,
    threats and technology, were claiming control of the type one format. This failed
    of course, everybody got to have any fonts they wanted and publishing bloomed,
    wherever postscript went.\r\n\r\nThen about 20 years ago, the web came along and
    stripped the web using world of its free choice in live fonts, forcing anyone
    who wanted a typographic personality to do it via graphics, and all but eliminating
    typographic choice in reading sizes, unless bad versions of Helvetica, Times Roman
    and Courier, at low resolution, was the publisher's \"thing.\"\r\n\r\nOnly 8 years
    ago did the healing begin on this with the move towards @fonface. Meanwhile a
    whole generation of developers (will get to \"that generation\" of readers in
    a second), grew up reading a small selection of fonts used for all purposes, and
    when this generation got to do their technology thing for reading devices, these
    devices dint have many fonts... Or not as many as the wide spectrum of fonts authors
    and publishers used in the printed books they were selling to readers...\r\n\r\nSo,
    after all that, for 50 k people pf that generation to say no thanks, I want my
    Baskerville? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
