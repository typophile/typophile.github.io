  body: What kind of advise? Looks fun, though I personally can't read the lowercase
    "v" or "w" without working at it.

  body: "At first I was confused, but then I got it, so I think it works. The only
    one that's a bit ambiguous to me is the \"* selection of lovely seasonal fresh
    veg PUDDING * ice cream with chocolate sauce\". Is this three items or two items?
    \ If three, \"PUDDING\" is missing an asterisk. If two, is it \"veg PUDDING\"
    or \"PUDDING ice cream?\" This needs to be clearer.\r\n\r\nThe \"ice cream sauce\"
    and \"with chocolate\" seem to be two different elements to me. It looks like
    \"ice cream sauce\" and \"mousse gateaux with chocolate wedding cake\". I'd tuck
    the \"with chocolate\" in between \"ice cream\" and \"sauce\" to be more consistent
    with the other items on the menu.\r\n\r\nAssuming \"PUDDING\" is its own item,
    I'd set \"ice cream with chocolate sauce\" (in a single column) in pink and \"wedding
    cake\" in white to help with clarity.\r\n\r\nI agree about the 'v' and 'w' - it
    reads as \"roedding cake,\" \"ice cream roith chocolate sauce\".\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    this looks really cool :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "yes, to me the 'v's look like topless 'b's and the I's merge with the next
    letter to form U's\r\n\r\nI wonder if switching typeface might solve them or maybe
    it's just me.  I mean, I'm a designer, so after studying typography I should be
    better equipped to deal with these things, but the reading order lost me a couple
    of times. (although I am canadian, so maybe I'm just not used to reading your
    typographic accent ;-)\r\n\r\noh, and good luck with the wedding, must be exciting
    times!"
