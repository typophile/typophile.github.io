  body: "It does not look like digital type. If it were  you would need two different
    fonts for the different widths.\r\nYou could start with http://www.dafont.com/staubach.font?nb_ppp=50&text=GLEN+WANDIN
    or looke here http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=104&nb_ppp=50 to look at alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe
    very reason of existence for this kind of lettering was that it could be easily
    cut out so you didn't need a computer ;-) AFAIK only US teams still use that awkward
    kind of lettering. European sports teams prefer more recent type on their tee
    shirts."

  body: Thanks so much. I've also started to think that these were cut-out or stenciled
    letters, so it helped that you confirmed this suspicion.
