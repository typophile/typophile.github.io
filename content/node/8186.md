body: Hey all I am still a newb layout guy for a little town newspaper.  One problem
  that has been nagging me is a spacing problem when I convert the copy into columns
  format.  Some of the spacing between the words is horrible &#40;ie to close or to
  far apart&#41;.   <BR> <BR>Maybe you guys could give me some tips on how to fix
  this?   <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Thanks Alessandro for your help. <BR> <BR>Its seems that the text is fine
    when I check it with show hidden characters.  The actual physcial spacing is fine
    just that some sentences done &#34;wrap&#34; well in columns. I really dont know
    how to fix it.  Its funny cause when I use &#34;Justify with last line alinged
    left&#34; it looks good.  But I would rather use columnns.

  body: Hey thanks for all the help again. <BR> <BR>No, I cant change the column width
    or the font size. Usually text will end up looking way to spaced out or way to
    tight.  We usually have to add a word or two to make it space right.  Its really
    cutting into our production and making me look bad as well <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
