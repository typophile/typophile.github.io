  italic.\r\n\r\nI think a cursive heberw would be better then a block hebrew since
  it has a more delicate informal style.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any ideas
  :) \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I am not Jewish, but I don't think that it makes sense to compare Garamond
    italic with Hebrew letters. I did search for 'cursive Hebrew' and came up with
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-hebrew-cursive/\">this font</a>
    by Dennis Ortiz-Lopez, who also has a Hebrew name.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi, Thanks.\r\n\r\nYea I guess you cant compare the fonts. But I just want
    a hebrew font with low contrast similar to Garamond.\r\n\r\nThere is a more formal
    style hebrew used for books etc. and there is an informal handwritten style of
    hebrew.\r\nSee first two pictures on this site for the difference: http://www.jerusalem-insiders-guide.com/hebrew-alphabet-chart.html\r\n\r\nI
    found a formal hebrew script that sort of jives with Garamond. (If you have free
    time watch this, its interesting: http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/58585/letters-lost-and-found/
    \r\n\r\nBut Im looking for a handwritten style hebrew with a low contrast.\r\n\r\nIf
    you know of any let me know :)\r\n"

  body: "I think you are going to have a very hard time matching old style latin italics
    with any Hebrew. There are three basic problems: one is that there is no Hebrew
    script with semi-connecting strokes like those in italic. The second one is that
    traditionally Hebrew is not slanted in the direction of italic, but a bit the
    other way in hand written scripts. The third is that even the informal hand, ketav
    yad, has reversed contrast compared to latin.\r\n\r\nIf you can find something
    to work, kol hakavod, but I'll be surprised.  \r\n\r\nIf you match a roman style
    with the formal Hebrew square script it is still hard, but doable. \"Sans\" in
    the two languages can work, as can two relatively low contrast faces.\r\n\r\n
