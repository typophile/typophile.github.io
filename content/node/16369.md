  body: "Ken, everybody is asking us to ID a font. If you look at the titles of the
    other threads you'll see things like\r\n\r\nScrambler Marie's\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nJamie
    Oliver logo sans typeface\r\n\r\nEven something simpler like \"Deco Sans\" or
    \"Papyrus like font\" will help.\r\n\r\nThese kinds of titles make it easier to
    find the thread and distinguish it from the others (including your own). It also
    saves Yves a little work having to creatively rename it."
