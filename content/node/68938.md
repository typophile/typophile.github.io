  layout in microsoft Excel (?!). I want to re-do it in illustrator.\r\nIts a simple
  label only with latin and arabic text.\r\nWhen I open the excel file the label presents
  the fonts correctly, but if I do a copy and paste it in illustrator the characters
  disappear.\r\nHow do I set Arabic text in illustrator? The font is Calibri.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: Illustrator does not support Arabic layout unless you get the Middle East
    version from WinSoft. Probably what you will need to do, once you've figured out
    what Arabic font to use, is to set the Arabic text in e.g. Word (Windows, not
    Mac), print to PDF, and embed the PDF as a graphic in Illustrator.
