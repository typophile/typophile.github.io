  when I  noticed that the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macmini/graphics.html\">Mac
  Mini page</a> at Apple is using some <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1657923\">Front
  242</a> lyrics for catchy subheads. (I think it's from their track \"Headhunter\".)
