  to man. Lowercase is prefered although if you know if any uppercase 'E's that need
  to be accepted to the 'e' hall of fame please do let me know. \r\n\r\nFeel free
  to post images, I'll like this forum to become an 'e' fest.\r\n\r\nI may extend
  this forum to include other letters over a period of time, to create the ultimate
  aestheic typeface.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\njavi"

    (esp. sans) is a strong contender, no matter what you think of it in terms of
    a typeface as such, that has been discussed in full length, width, depth and then
    some. and yes, it certainly does fall over to the left. \r\nbut still a beaut!

    'e' should be e-ish or not. To be honest I am not bothered whether it reads well.
    Since I have been getting some very good feedback I am going to be looking to
    build, the most aesthetical collage of letters from A - Z , whether these are
    FAT, serif, non-serif will not matter.\r\nI understand that beauty is in the eye
    of the beholder but I want to look at each letter individually and see where that
    takes us.\r\n\r\nIn light of this what do you guys think about these two? Avant

    Feliciano quote is completely true, IF you want to use type as traditionally intended,

    to do this) and use them individually then I think we can continue our quest.\r\n\r\nWith
    our findings, somewhere down the timeline (prob next year ;) I will be looking
    to create the ultimate alphabet in large letters probably produced in high quality
    materials and offer them as decorative elements through my site www.vialetter.com.
    Thats if you guys don't mind me getting your opinions and getting the correct

    nearly hundred old design, originally foundry type, there is no copy protection
    on the design itself, though there may be on the name 'Centaur.' My guess would
    be that if you call it 'Unicorn' you can publish it as you like yourself or sell
    it to a foundry as a better digitization of the Bruce Rogers original. After all
    there is also P22's <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/metropolitan.html\">Metropolitan</a>,
    another digitization of essentially the same design (and I think different from
    the earlier version when Giampa owned Lanston?)  \r\n\r\nDid you draw that using
    your new curve drawing program, as I had assumed? "

    I wanted to call it Firenze after the centaur in the Harry Potter chronicles,
    but I believe there's already a Zapf face by that name. Or i liked Chimera, but
    let me check... didn't find one, but there still may be a font by that name...

    issue is how they look in combination with the other letters.\r\n\r\nThis remembers
    me of a phrase I read once in a book about Caslons faces.\r\nThat he was believed
    to not care about much about the single letters instead only looking\r\nat the
    appearance of the entire text.\r\nI believe this is (although I don\u2019t think
    that Caslon worked this way) in part true\r\nand in part untrue at the same time.\r\nBecause
    its the single letter that we design where we lay our hearts into\r\nand if we
    do so I think in the most powerful characters things (letters) will join up\r\ntogether
    in the most beautiful and natural way.\r\nOtherwise it would be like saying: Oh
    yes I have a wonderful family.\r\nYes, my mother is alright, also my son maybe
    but whats most important of all\r\nis how they stay together as a family. In part
    true as I said above.\r\nBut wouldn\u2019t you prefer to say: I love may mother,
    she is the most tender\r\nperson in the world, I do love my beautiful son, he
    is the joy of my live,\r\nI love may gorgeous daughter.. (and so on the way)..this
    is my beautiful family?\r\nAt least that is what I do with my letters.\r\n\r\nAs
