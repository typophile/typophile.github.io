  body: Digital Engraving on 9th at Folsom is excellent. I&#39;ve wroked with them
    for years.  <BR> <BR>Full Circle Press in Grass Valley is also top notch and considerably
    cheaper than any other LP printer around. They&#39;re very cool about sending
    press sheets so you don&#39;t have t make press checks. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve worked
    with Mercurio Brothers before &#40;though not for LP&#41;, a good choice for the
    budget-conscious project. <BR> <BR>Julie actually refused to let me make a press
    check. Haven&#39;t worked with her since.
