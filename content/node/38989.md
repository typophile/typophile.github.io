    up with their copy of <em>Elements</em>, we won't have a lot to talk about. Other
    than agreeing with each other about how great Bringhurst's book is.\r\n\r\nWe
    probably won't be discussing the Grizzlies."

  body: "If you\u2019re concerned about having a topic for debate, I could start out
    on how I think Bringhurst is a bit overblown. His writing has always tired me
    out before it has a chance to sink in. That being said, I may have to bring along
    my copy of \u201CBig Red\u201D as my companion. Mind your beer coasters."

    anything that speaks to \"design\" as an influence on type and typographical design,
    if it has influenced one's personal work.  ;-)\r\n\r\nThat should eliminate multiple
    copies of Bringhurst...."

  body: "<strong>Summary</strong>\r\n\r\n1. The Kensington Pub was very crowded and
    we were unable to get a table immediately. So there was some standing around and
    discussion of how crowded the K-Pub was. Linda brought treasures from the Wayzgoose
    in Vancouver, which were greatly admired from a standing perspective. And then
    a group of non-type-speaking people left, freeing their table for us. Yeah.\r\n\r\n2.
    Listen up: we're gonna change venues for the December meeting. We don't want to
    fight the Christmas-shopping crowd getting liqueured up at the K-Pub next month,
    so we're going to meet at Julio's Barrio, a scant half-block away from K-Pub.
    Linda has booked the entire second floor for the Calgary Typos. So we can have
    a Christmas-type type meeting. Bring friends. Bring baggage. Spread out. (If Veer/Corbis
    wants to have a Christmas party, we'll donate a corner for you. You can even set
    up a barrier so our type discussion won't interfere with your type discussion.)\r\n\r\n3.
    Lex reported that his laptop's battery ran out and then died in the middle of
    Geophysics class. We were all sad. For a moment.\r\n\r\n4. Derek brought along
    a copy of <em>Uncommon Vision</em> by Peter Ciccariello. (Not sure if it was for
    Show & Tell or \"Bring your favourite type book\", they sort of got intermingled.)
    In Derek's words, the artist \"folded type into each abstract landscape\". I haven't
    googled it yet, but it's a lovely book and well worth a search.\r\n\r\n5. From
    Linda, thanks to Jim Rimmer for his hospitality. And she isn't even sorry for
    stretching the half-hour appointment into an hour-and-a-half."
