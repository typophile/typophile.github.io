  body: They seem to work by adding quarter and eighth &#34;pixels&#34; to create
    varying depths of gray when rasterized in Flash. It&#39;s basically custom anti-aliasing
    for bitmap fonts. Apparently optimized for Flash&#39;s rasterizer, they don&#39;t
    come out nearly as good in other apps.

  body: I&#39;m not sure why, technically. It could have something to do with the
    way FFF expands the outlines slighty to prevent filled-in counters in Flash.  Here
    are some samples of FFF Business in Flash MX, Fireworks MX, and Photoshop 7. Also
    zoom views of the letter &#39;a&#39; for each, and a snapshot of the vector outlines
    in Fontlab. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12792.gif"

  body: '| It could have something to do with the way  <BR>| FFF expands the outlines
    slighty to prevent <BR>| filled-in counters in Flash.  <BR> <BR>It is due to expanded
    outlines. Flash renders characters on the left glyph margin, but Photoshop will
    include glyph spillover, if any. Most FFF fonts include these optimizations for
    the Flash renderer. However, they are not part of the Super Pixel technique. The
    newest Super Pixel font &#39;Halogen&#39; is trimmed to the margin instead and
    does not blur in Photoshop or Flash. &#40;it does lighten a little in Dynamic
    vs. Static mode in Flash, see image below&#41; <BR> <BR>The second poster was
    right, the technique adds hand-antialiasing to pixel fonts without all that dangerous
    mucking about with hinting. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12951.gif"

  body: Hrant, Garf,  <BR> <BR>Antialiasing must be turned on, unless you&#39;re in
    Flash with a dynamic text field. In that case, the operating system itself draws
    the text. So I get the following results. Notice that at low quality, Halogen
    and Business lose their grey pixels, but Halogen retains them in the dynamic text
    field. In every example, dynamic is lighter than static, because it&#39;s being
    rendered by Windows 2000 with basic font smoothing &#40;circa 95 plus pack&#41;.
    The black block is a difference filter between Medium and Best quality - no difference.

    Pixel Fonts in low quality&#44; static and dynamic text"> <BR> <BR>Business and
    Halogen were built differently - Walter Apai of FFF designed Business after seeing
    my prototype super pixel fonts. Walter improved the use of the technique visually,
    and I improved the technical side. About a month after Business came out, I released
    Halogen, using a further refined technical approach.  FFF has access to the full

    <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t get this part.  <BR>&#62; hhp  <BR> <BR>I meant to say,
    each version of Flash down to the original FutureSplash uses antialiasing. When
    a font is decomposed into geometry for display as static text, it will be antialiased.
    So, it&#39;s likely that very old versions of Flash will support Super Pixel Fonts.

  body: Hi Miguel, Hrant,  <BR> <BR>This is not a rude question and it comes up a
    lot. The generic name for greyscale pixel font methods is &#34;sub-pixel fonts&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Super Pixel fonts&#34; describes a patent pending technique which
    provides reliable rendering on all TrueType environments. Your grey dot fonts
    will probably be great &#40;disclaimer, I love your fonts&#41; but they won&#39;t
    be &#34;Super Pixel fonts&#34; unless you license with us and build them like
    we do. Hrant is right, it takes more than sub-pixels. <BR> <BR>In many countries,
    It is still legal to protect a method even if you are not a rich corporation.  A
    patent holder is not obligated to extort and coerce, only to assert ownership.
    We hope to do this right. <BR> <BR>-chris

    for MacPaint so I made a few by doubling a 24 point font and smoothing it out

    by the Apple LaserWriter when printing 72 dpi images &#40;from MacPaint&#41; -
    a mechanical, but competent, interpolation up to 300 dpi. I think some paint software
    was capable of the trick as well. <BR> <BR>I do not agree that his scheme&#39;s
    &#34;errors and inaccuracies would likely be insignificant&#34;. No scheme is
    the equal of the eye, reader or typographer. But it&#39;s a big step up from nothing.
    the author of SmoothType should try it out as a rendering option. This would help
    old designs keep up with antialiased outline fonts. <BR> <BR>-chris

    trusted pixel fonts that works... <BR> <BR>About the misterious wathever name
    of greys.., they can EASYLY make on the old good fog, of course is abouth math,
    and 25%  - like mini magic pixel on every grey angle <BR> <BR>I thinks there is
    no exclusive licence technique when every one can buy fog or fontlab and making
    such effects. In two months all the pixel font designers will be using it. <BR>
    <BR>Now, back to the essential think.. <BR>Quality and talent on type design,
    that could be trusted, thats credibility, and a niche on the market. <BR> <BR>Keep
    on the good work pixel pals, <BR> <BR>mh. <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'mh said: <BR>&#62; flash mx 2004 dont have the filled bug,  <BR>&#62; so
    anyone can buid trusted pixel fonts that works... <BR> <BR>good to know. I meant
    to say, people come to FFF for clean, non-smudging fonts. And now, apparently,
    for Flash 4/5/6 compatibility. <BR> <BR>&#62; I thinks there is no exclusive licence  <BR>&#62;
    technique when every one can buy fog or  <BR>&#62; fontlab and making such effects.  <BR>
    <BR>Everyone can buy MSVC and write their own GFX apps too, but if they put tabbed
    palettes in the UI, Adobe can sue them. Look Miguel, we are not going to stop
    microfoundries from making &#34;super subpixel misterious FX wahtever name of
    MX greys font fonts&#34;. But if you start selling a lot of them, dont be surprised
    if at some point we ask you for 5% of the price. Unless you were doing it a year
    ago and got it notarized. But you weren&#39;t, you did it cause I did it. Get
    a time machine. I&#39;ve got one, how do you think I invent these things. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; In two months all the pixel font designers  <BR>&#62; will be using
    it.  <BR> <BR>I know. I am really, really happy about this. I knew you all would
    make brillant work with it. Hitting you up for a piece of the action is the hard
    part. It could have been HP, Apple, or some godawful &#34;patent holding company&#34;
    controlling this thing. It&#39;s just me and my little company Miguel, and we
    freaking love you. Be glad. <BR> <BR>&#62; Keep on the good work pixel pals,  <BR>&#62;
    mh. <BR> <BR>You too. See if you can beat me to the next idea, I got 2 more.  <BR>-c'

    do pepsi maybe? i really dont know. <BR> <BR>I dont know if pixietype or others

    opetation, control the blur that images produce on a vector is not to hard to
    understand on numbers. You have to try on your fab font edit app. <BR> <BR>I am
    shure that you could do your own stuff too there in India... <BR> <BR> <BR>mh.

    sell super pixel fonts without showing the name of your font designers? <BR> <BR>Do
    you have authorization from FFF or truth in Design for using this technique? <BR>
    <BR>Are you from Argentina? <BR> <BR>mh. <BR> <BR>

  body: Nice one Darryl, <BR> <BR>FYI, if a designer doesn&#39;t want to figure it
    out and do it by hand, she/he can paint fonts in Photoshop and publish through
    TiD&#39;s new foundry. <BR> <BR>TiD has built a converter&#42; that makes gray-pixel
    TTFs out of pixel images. Fonts from many typographers will debut next month,
    more are welcome.  &#42;it is not based on bitfonter.

  body: TiD&#39;s automatic converter introduces a degree of iteration in the design
    process without which any grayscale-pixelfont effort is effectively crippled.
    <BR> <BR>And Darryl, it seems that there is a small subset of grayscale-pixelfont
    methods that results in consistent and robust rendering across various apps &#40;such
    as Photoshop versus Flash versus native-OS, etc.&#41; as opposed to just working
    fine in one of them. Chris has done much legwork there. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
