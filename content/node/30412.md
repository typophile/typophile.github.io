  ligatures (ct  & st -similar to caslon's ligatures) and I was wondering if anyone
  knew which Stempel Garamond he used? I have linotypes and the opentype version however
  they only have two ligatures (ff & fl) \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nRick"

  body: "There is only one digital Stempel Garamond commercially available. Stempel
    Garamond is the Garamond cut by the D. Stempel AG, which became part of Linotype
    in 1985.\r\n\r\nSabon Next, which is Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez's revival, redesign,
    and extension of Sabon, has more ligatures. Sabon was produced by Stempel in the
    1960s, and bears many similarities to Stempel Garamond. http://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html"
