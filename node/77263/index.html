  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone, 

I'm by no means a font or logo designing expert. I was wondering if I could get some advice for fonts and mark ideas for an online learning company. Just a bunch of ideas that I can use as a kick-off for trying things out as I'm not artistically creative at all. I'm just a software architect - not much of a designer - so that's pretty much on the completely other side of the spectrum for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sadly, it is not up to me about hiring a designer. LOL. I am totally with you there.

The company's approach online learning is very innovative and different from all the other companies. Also, their solutions drastically save costs over traditional training, but even drastically reduce costs of current online training/learning solutions out there. The software they provide that lets organizations create learning programs or courses is ridiculously easy to use and is very interactive (web 2.0, lots of ajax). There's also lots of social components and an emphasis on mobile learning.

Also, the company name, which I'm not sure if I am allowed to say, is a short-snappy word of 5 letters. So I guess the font has to be good for that sort of thing.

Is that enough info? :/</div>

I understand your hesitation to mention the company name, but it's unlikely that we could offer any suggestions that are very creative or specific to your company without knowing it. 

Maybe if you listed some of the company's qualities  that you're trying to communicate (a list of several adjectives, for instance), we might be able to suggest some fonts that have those qualities. (For example, hypothetically if someone said "I'm looking for a font that's feminine, traditional, and energetic", then that's a starting point for font selection.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I can give you a sense of the benefits the product provides and who it's for.

While this is a web 2.0 project, it's target audience isn't really 20-year olds who is using facebook. On the contrary, it's established businesses who, believe it or not, are hiring or at least training their current employees.

The niche market for this product is people that want to drastically save money for doing customized training that is online/offsite. There's a lot of systems out there that offer pre-packaged learning programs all over the net, but that doesn't work for companies who need to create their own content for internal training/learning. That's basically where this software really excels. It can do the other stuff too, but that's not really that important from a brand point of view.

One of the big drawbacks with online software is that they basically suck currently. This service is actually quite good. For example, a non-techie can design a completely custom course/learning program for their organization, or for others, in literally fractions of the time it would take with inferior software. 

Actually, a lot of the stuff you can do with this service is not even possible with current web learning software. It's basically crazy ajax pushing the current browsers to the max in terms of interactivity. 

Basically, it's the most innovative and feature rich product out there. I wish I could explain just how "custom" I'm talking about because it doesn't constrain you to build your learning material in any way at all. You can invent the structure, how it looks, everything, which is has not been done by anyone else.

As far as I know, it's the smartest system out there. I wrote it so that it gives hints based on context and if you write human sentences in it (when that applies), the system does a pretty damn good job understanding what you told it. That's not the start feature or anything, but it's there for companies who want to analyze the semantics of their answers and go beyond drag/drop or simple fill-in-the-blanks, multiple choice, etc.

It's also fully socialized, unlike a lot of software. It's got tons of things to help everyone in the organization collaborate and integrate their training/learning. A lot of this kind of software that's out there right now is very isolating, where you interact with the computer, or at best, a live trainer. The furthest any system goes for actual learning is maybe chat rooms, but this thing goes a million times further and better.

And then there's the mobile aspect. Anyone can do all of this stuff from their cell phone if they want to.

Oh, and I guess the people using this software have a far likelier chance of actually learning stuff and retaining it. That's not really that important though because of lot of companies surprisingly don't care. Really, it comes to down reducing training costs drastically.

I hope that tells you something useful :p</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mystic, I appreciate your effort to explain further, but as far as font suggestions are concerned, what you've given is background info that would be useful to a designer who's going to spend several weeks developing your logo & identity system, but it's not very useful when it comes to making a few offhand font suggestions. 

It's not like there are a bunch of fonts that communicate concepts like "innovative and feature rich" and "fully-socialized software".  Those are concepts that would be communicated mainly via your marketing plan. 

Font selection communicates more general concepts -- masculine/feminine, modern/traditional, static/active, simple/ornate, formal/casual, etc. Thus my suggestion previously that you come up with a short list of simple adjectives which tell the qualities you're trying to communicate via the font selection.</div>
