  body: "Thanks akira1975 for the reference to the previous thread.\r\nIf mr_h's image
    is in fact Linotype Old Style No. 1, then Mark Simonson's comment seems spot on:\r\n---start
    quote---\r\nYour sample is an old Linotype face called Old Style No. 1. I don't
    think it has been digitized (other than Andrew Leman's distressed version). Century
    Old Style is similar in details, but heavier (as Nick mentioned). Bruce Old Style
    is closer in terms of weight and feel, but differs in the details.\r\n---end quote---\r\nI
    just want to footnote the reference to Andrew Leman's version. It not deliberately
    distressed. Rather it's the product of an apparently unedited auto-trace intended
    to produce a font good enough for use as a \"prop font\" in movies etc.\r\nPerhaps
    Linotype Old Style No. 1 is not digitized because it does not seem particularly
    interesting for contemporary book publishing, particularly with the rise of e-books,
    which work best with fonts optimized for screen reading. It's a lot of work to
    make a proper book text font and very few are produced for this shrinking market,
    compared to the flood of new fonts for advertising, web, games etc.\r\nIMHO most
    people would not notice much difference between the LT OS and the Bruce OS digitized
    by BT.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thank you everyone for your replies! I didn't have a single clue before,
    it's such a great help!\r\n\r\nI'm new to this font/type world, but if a font
    is not 'digitized', does that mean it's not available for editing use at all?\r\n\r\nTo
    add a little perspective, this is from a book that was printed in 2000 (although
    it is a 'photographic reprint', so the original might be older than that), and
    now my assignment is to do a reproduction of the book - for reprinting. Relating
    this to Don's opinion about the font \r\n\r\nAnother question - this is not 100%
    related to fonts, but I'm guessing the type experts here would know..? If I'm
    starting with a book (an actual physical copy), and I have to make a reproduction
    of it, would it be possible to just scan it and print it off? Because if the font
    is not available for digital use, it does complicate things a bit.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    thank you so much for the responses, those really help me with my work!\r\n\r\nHans\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Somewhat off topic for font ID. But for what it is worth, a few comments
    on your questions.\r\nOptions for a book reprint are yet another photo reprint,
    assuming the source copy is in good shape. Or OCR the book and choose a font.
    This will take longer than the first option because it requires proofreading the
    OCR results. \r\nIMHO the font can be quite different than the original and legibility/readability
    factors dominate. Depends on the subject matter. If the book is very time & place
    specific then its enjoyable to pick a font that is appropriate for the era. If
    you like the tone of the LT Old Style No. 1, then the Bruce version would work
    fine.  Most readers won't notice this substitution. Indeed, most readers only
    notice a book font if it is hard to read.\r\nDon"

    here..\r\n\r\nWe've decided to do the scan & OCR method, that's why I'm looking

    version and a couple other alternative mentioned in the linked post.\r\n\r\nI
    actually don't know a thing about typefaces and design - so all the help here

  body: "Your welcome.\r\nThis IS a standard Linotype font and was used in many 20th
    century books. It's tempting to digitize it, the LT specimen of 1905 includes
    the many special characters, accents, symbols etc. that were available as part
    of the font, but I can't see much in the way of commercial sales for it, particularly
    since I couldn't sell it as a book text font under it's original name. And sales
    of book fonts are abysmal unless they are sold by LT or other ultra established
    foundries such as Hoefler & Frere Jones. Unlike old display fonts where there
    is no problem with anyone using a new name and promoting it in flashy context.
    \ Anyway, the Bruce should work fine.\r\nDon"
