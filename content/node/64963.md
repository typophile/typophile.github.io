body: It's been quite a while since I've posted an entry but I've been quite busy
  working on my portfolio and some other things. I had an idea to add a section to
  my portfolio where I don't show finished work, but rather specific skills. It's
  just going to be a small section where I can show things like before and after pictures
  of color correction, illustration, etc. I am not a type designer but would like
  to show some sort of type treatment as well. Does anyone have an idea of a type
  exercise that might be good in this context? As always, I appreciate any advice
  you have to offer.

    nice before-and-after. And you could even discuss the process/result right here.\r\n\r\n*
    I've recently started doing that even in large headlines when there is time \u2013
    convert to outlines and make ligatures, alternates, flourishes\u2026 Who says
    fonts need to be set the way they come out of the box!"

  body: Designing a typeface is a larger project than I am looking for right now.
    I would love to do it but it's not what I had in mind for this. I like the logo
    idea, I've done plenty of logos before but using type exclusively and modifying
    it might be a good exercise for this. Thanks for the help.
