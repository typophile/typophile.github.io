  foundries have expressed support for Tal Leming's web font proposal on Twitter</a>
  in the last few days, and so have some influential web pundits like <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/15/leming-van-blokland\">Gruber</a>.
  Its an impressive list, to be sure, and may become the web font format for all browsers
  in the future.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/60006\">Typotheque</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/veen/3572372312/\">TypeKit</a> (EDIT:
  and <a href=\"http://kernest.com/\">Kernest</a>) are doing a good job of bringing
  web fonts to 99% of browsers <strong>today</strong>. \r\n\r\nBut little has been
  said about <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/otpermtable/\">David Berlow's PERM
  table proposal</a>, published Wednesday - <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/otpermtable/\">www.fontbureau.com/otpermtable/</a>
  - which\r\nhe <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/news/2009-07-15\">introduces on
  the FB blog</a>.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd start a thread here. \r\n\r\nWho supports
  the PERM table? :-)"

    launch, you seem to have a strange concept of \"today\". ;)\r\n\r\nBesides, the
    Typotheque solution is nothing new, a similar proof of concept implementation
    has been presented by Ralf Herrmann nearly two years ago."

  body: "Well, I obviously support perm. It is the first 21st-century meta-data subfile
    for any media type and whether generally accepted or not, it is what users and
    developers really want \u2014  teaching not busting, updatable, upgradeable, and
    likably linkable, machine/human-readable, user-interface-able at every level from
    founder to end user. Please support it, or Harry Parker will shoot my dog Mutton.\r\n\r\n>Many
    foundries have expressed support for Tal Leming\u2019s web font proposal on Twitter\r\n\r\nI
    wish the list my best. Developing web fonts is even more informative then reading,
    say, 1,000 entries such as this, maybe a million. Or... what would founder X on
    that list be charging for such a Tal font order? Tal what are you going to charge
    for fonts in your format to; a previous licensee for print, a new licensee for
    print, and new licensee for both? We have business and development plans all the
    way out to 'delivery', with PERM, or no PERM, or PERM Sooner, or PERM later. In
    case you are interested though, I am only permitted to make legitimate offers.
    \r\n\r\nFurthermore, if these listed foundries really want potential protections
    for all their font licensing activities, the perm table is retroactively listing
    fields for licensing and other activities we've needed bits for, for years. What
    does Tal's proposal have to say about OEM bundling? about modification rights?
    about transferability? Isn't it time for not-entirely web-related permissions
    and recommendations to be stated inside fonts? Isn't it time to move backwards
    and forwards a little, get a complete grip, and then take off in whatever format
    they decide on... already perm-ed?\r\n\r\nThen there is Tal's list of fields which
    repeats much of what is already in the font, adding a little to the education
    of users, but e.g reinforcing the idea that answering the question of 'who designed
    the font?' is more important than say, how well it is suited to blinking, setting
    at 9 ppm or on a curved baseline?  Is this really how the font designers want
    our view of 'what's important' to be viewed?\r\n\r\nIs \"text describing the font\"
    supposed to handle all this? Where it the machine-readability in that? In the
    end, about compression? In the short term, (i.e. before broadened bandwidth makes
    font file sizes irrelevant in seeking instant movie downloads), compression is
    needed to be solved in the presence of the font, the use and the document, and
    not before, (if you're the protective kinda typophile). \r\n\r\nI'd also be sickened
    and disgusted by the divisive processes of uncooperative proposal and counter
    proposal ;) and tired by 350 hours of community service since spring (without
    being convicted of anything, much less pleading guilty), but in about 30 seconds,
    I'm on the first day of a two week vacation. \r\n\r\nThe last thing that was added
    to the OT spec in this area, was the DSIG table<em>... is it our turn yet?</em>\r\n\r\nCheers
    and Laters!"

    months - as it was explained to me by Jeff's partner Bryan Mason at TypeCon -
    they were keenly aware that web fonts were a big topic of conversation now, today,
    and insofar as they absolutely were going to have a working product shortly it
    was necessary for them to find a way to get in on the conversation and get a seat
    at the table.\r\nCredit to them for certainly having done so. I wish I could drum
    up that much support for an idea of mine!\r\nThe have a working beta preview going
    on right now.\r\nQuite real."
