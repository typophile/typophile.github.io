  and I was wondering if somebody could help me with site propositions (typography
  related of course), anything from bookstores to cemeteries. All suggestions will
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKTKM"

    5 years ago, lots of old shop signage was still in existence. But the city was
    obviously changing fast - building sites everywhere, and fantastic old buildings
    being demolished. If you do a lot of walking you may still stumble across some
    gems.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

    there\u2019s an interesting article about that very topic in [[Ultrabold]] #1,
    a <a href=\"http://stbride.org/friends/publications/ultrabold\">journal published</a>
    by the [[St Bride Library]]."
