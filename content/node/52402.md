body: "A fun typeface for light-hearted projects. I've used it primarily for t-shirt
  designs and posters for children's activities. I know it isn't the usual fare for
  folks around here. Available at Myfonts.com for $10 - includes the solid and the
  openface forms.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontry-west/wild2-peppermint/]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PM_SnowAd500_6365.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  You for not brandishing pitchforks and lighted torches....\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Not something you'd use everyday, but I think it looks really cool :D\r\nThe
    odd angles really make each character stand out, so that the whole word seems
    to be alive. I can see it being used for a coffee shop advertising a peppermint
    latte or something.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
