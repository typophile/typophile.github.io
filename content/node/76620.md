  have been pondering over this for some time.\r\n\r\nThe bar of the 'A's are pretty
  low and the 'M' is unique unlike anything I have seen.\r\n\r\nIts a mix of OCR-B,
  Trebuchet (the A with a low bar) and Monaco (the Zeros).\r\n\r\nCan't seem to identity
  it! Anyone wants to give it a go? and are there any ALTERNATIVES?\r\n\r\nIt is very
  similar to this http://www.abstractfonts.com/forum/images/92e9e6f03961f015e3b69b50835d5cb5.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance:)\r\n\r\nIf it can't be seen, try here: http://www.esmog.org/bilder/1265028627.jpg"
