  Type - Cheng, Karen. Yale University Press, 2006\r\n\r\nFrom the publisher\r\n\r\n\r\nAs
  one of a graphic designer\u2019s most essential tools, typefaces influence the appearance
  of visual print materials perhaps more than any other component. This essential
  book explains the processes behind creating and designing type. Author Karen Cheng
  discusses issues of structure, optical compensation, and legibility, with special
  emphasis given to the often overlooked relationships between letters and shapes
  in a font.\r\n\r\nThe book is illustrated with numerous diagrams that demonstrate
  visual principles and letter construction, ranging from informal progress sketches
  to final type designs and diagrams. A wide range of classic and modern typefaces
  is analyzed, including those from many premier contemporary type foundaries. Introductory
  essays and diagrams emphasize the history of type, the primary systems of typeface
  classification, the two main proportional systems for type, the parts of a letter,
  the effects of new technology on design methodology, the optical illusions that
  affect density and balance in letterforms, and the differences in form between basic
  serif typestyles. The book provides detailed guidelines for creating serif and sans
  serif letters, numbers, punctuation, and accents.  \r\n\r\nAs design clients increasingly
  call for original and custom typefaces, Designing Type is a superb reference for
  both students and professional graphic designers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
