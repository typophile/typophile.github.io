body: "First, let me say I am aware of <a href=http://typophile.com/node/19778>this
  thread</a> and those linked from it. I do think I understand the concepts behind
  [[GPOS]] and [[ccmp]].\r\n\r\nNow, my problem is the following: I am trying to tweak
  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_UCS_Outline_Fonts>a font</a> into displaying
  certain diacritica combinations (such as k+ \u0311 /006b,0311/ and a+ \u0304+ \u0301
  /0060,0304,0301/ and others) <i>and</i> I want to use it with a real-life word processor,
  either OpenOffice (NeoOffice) or Word (2003, for OS X).\r\n\r\nMy present solution
  is to create the glyphs I need and define them as \"liga\" of the characters involved.
  I know this is a \"hack\", not the purpose of \"liga\", since my glyphs are not
  ligatures in the narrow sense of the word (although I would argue that the boundary
  between ligatures and characters with diacritica is somewhat fluid).\r\n\r\nThis
  solution works for NeoOffice (but not for Word). Since this means I do have a working
  solution, I am now looking for a solution that is <i>not</i> a hack but still does
  actually work with my word processor (I won't be able to settle for a 'solution'
  that is theoretically correct but simply doesn't work, blame the developers)\r\n\r\nWhat
  options do I have? I tried GPOS, and that doesn't seem to work with <i>any</i> of
  my applications. I think I tried ccmp, and that didn't work either. I tried fiddling
  with kerning and separate glyphs like \"uni0311.Super\" to be used in certain combinations,
  and I didn't get that to work.\r\n\r\nSo what makes me think I missed something?
  There is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doulos_SIL>Doulos SIL</a> which likewise
  defines certain diacritica combinations as precomposed glyphs, such as \"uni00700304\"
  (pmacron). This one does show up correctly for the p+ \u0304 combination in NeoOffice
  (but not in Word). When I open the Doulos font in FontForge, I see that this glyph
  isn't listed as a ligature or anything else, it just sits there with its canonical
  name. I have no idea why NeoOffice displays this properly, it appears to be some
  functionality missing in FontForge, since when I generate it anew from FontForge,
  these glyphs cease to work.\r\n\r\nI have given this a lot of thought, and I am
  still stuck with my \"liga\" hack. I would be very grateful for advice how I could
  build a 'correct' font that still works with OpenOffice/NeoOffice, and especially
  for clarification of the 'Doulos enigma' just described.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n Dieter
  Bachmann\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    No version of Word for Mac OS X supports any kind of OpenType Layout processing.
    In general, the Word for Mac support for Unicode is rather poor. \r\n\r\n3. Word
    2003 for Windows supports \"ccmp\" (but not \"liga\"). \r\n\r\n4. You could assing
    the same lookups to both \"liga\" and \"ccmp\" if you want to maximize the \"success
    rate\" of your font. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Miguel, \r\n\r\nI think \"rlig\" is not supported in InDesign except the
    Middle East version. This is why I'd suggest associating the substitution lookup
    with both \"ccmp\" (where they semantically belong) and \"liga\" (where they *may*
    be put although their place in \"ccmp\" is better). \r\n\r\n\"ccmp\" would work
    in Apple WordPad, Apple Keynote, Apple Pages and other Mac OS X 10.4 Cocoa applications,
    in Word 2003/2007 for Windows, and in Adobe CS2 Middle East applications, while
    \"liga\" would work in the regular Adobe CS2 applications and other apps that
    support \"liga\" but not \"ccmp\" (e.g. QuarkXPress 7). \r\n\r\nAdam"
