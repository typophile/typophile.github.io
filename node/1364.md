  body: 16.007 is funny. and I&#39;d wear it! - only if the guys could order in that
    t-shirt style with the ribed sleeves <BR> <BR>the back could say something like
    &#34;2003 best times&#34; or something instead of repeating typophile to make
    it clearer?

  body: I actually don&#39;t like 001 at all and would be dissapointed if it reigned
    as champ. It&#39;s not a shirt color issue. Fun, cute, whimsical. But I don&#39;t
    care for the execution. Oh well. There&#39;s more to come. <BR> <BR>Of this batch,
    003, 006, and 007 preferred. <BR> <BR>-- randy
