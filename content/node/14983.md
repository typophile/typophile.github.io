  body: "The disk that came with the first Building Letters (Africa) had similar fonts,
    unfortunately the Building Letters site hasn't been updated for sometime and I
    cannot get the details from there or Union Fonts who were a driving force behind
    the project. I have the disk but it is at home so I cannot give you the designers
    names at the moment.\r\nTim"
