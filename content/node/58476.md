body: "I'm trying to remember the name of a typeface I saw not too long ago on the
  type ID board (I don't remember anything else about the context except what the
  face looked like).\r\n\r\nClues:\r\n\r\n\u2022 It is an unbracketed slab serif of
  medium weight\r\n\u2022 It is <strong>quite</strong> extended\r\n\u2022 The capital
  K splits like a Helvetica K\r\n\u2022 The capital J has a ball terminal\r\n\u2022
  The capital R's leg hooks up in the Clarendon fashion\r\n\r\nBonus clue:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  I also saw it recently on one of my grandmother's circular Springbok puzzles. The
  puzzle dates back to 1965, so the face is predigital. "
