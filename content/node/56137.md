  body: Beorcana is a good suggestion, though technically not a serif. I would go
    with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_tisa_ot/">FF
    Tisa</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/swift_std_virtual/">Swift</a>.

  body: I think she's a little more <em>pretty</em> than Whitney, which is more of
    a casual workhorse.

    but I've never used it myself. Anyone know if it's ok to work with?\r\n\r\n(edit:
    explaining myself: she's too lithe to be old-style or transitional, too cosmopolitan
    to be slab, too strong and plainspoken for something whiskery like Didot. I'm
    trying desperately to work in a pun about arms. There!)"
