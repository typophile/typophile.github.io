body: who/what is www.fontshop.se? they are selling my fonts without me having ever
  known they even existed. they also use images from fonthaus to display the fonts
  (at least mine). so it looks and feels very strange. any idea?

  body: only because they publish their address doesn't mean they are legit. has anybody
    bought fonts from them or sold fonts through them. why would they sell my stuff
    without contacting me about it and where in the world did they get my fonts from?

    FontShop Sweden AB has no affiliation with FSI [[FontShop]] International.

  body: Henning, if you look at your contract with FontHaus (and I assume you have
    one with them), you may notice that it contains some wording that gives them the
    right to sublicense. Judging from the FontHaus-originated samples, FontShop Sweden
    must be a FontHaus sublicensee. Assuming this is the case, your royalties from
    FontShop Sweden will show up on your FontHaus checks as a percentage of whatever
    your royalty is with FontHaus. So, if FontShop Sweden is paying FontHaus 50% to
    sublicense your fonts, you will get half your normal FontHaus royalty for those
    sales. If you don't want this to happen, you should contact FontHaus and renegotiate
    your contract. Or, you could make an agreement directly with FontShop Sweden and
    get a better deal than through the sublicense. (FYI, FontShop Sweden is not the
    only FontHaus sublicensee.)

  body: "You are absolutely correct, and perhaps I jumped to a wrong conclusion about
    their legitimacy in light of what Stephen says. \r\n\r\nI thought I had made a
    connection between fontshop.se and FSI but now I see it really isn't there.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    www.fontshop.se is. they said they'd look into it, but I haven't heard from them
    since. I suppose the next thing I'll do is contact fontshop.se directly.\r\n"
