  body: "It's a typeface by Hal Fiedler, developed for Photo-Lettering, Inc.  \r\n\r\nNot
    sure what it's called exactly, but it can be found in one of Photo-Lettering's
    Alphabet Thesauruses.  No digital version exists.  \r\n\r\nThe closest digital
    types are Fielder Gothic and California Grotesk Medium.  Both can be found at
    [[myfonts.com]]."
