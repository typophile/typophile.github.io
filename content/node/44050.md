body: "Hi. I have designed four weights of a new font family that I would like to
  appear in font menus with easily recognizable names reflecting their weight. For
  example\r\n\r\n1-MyFont Light,\r\n2-Myfont Regular,\r\n3-MyFont Semibold\r\n4-Myfont
  Bold.\r\n\r\nWhere the listed numbers are to simplify the discussion here.\r\n\r\nFont
  #3 should be the bold for font #1 in applications such as Word\r\nFont # 4 should
  be the bold for #2 in applications such as Word\r\nAll four weights should be accessible
  independently in the various font menus of different programs.\r\n\r\nI have tried
  various naming schemes as suggested in discussions here and in the Fontlab MSN forums
  with little success. The name MyFont Medium seems to be generated automatically
  instead of the 'Semibold' for #3. Medium is an ambiguous term and it will not be
  clear to the user that it is heavier than 'Regular'. I even tried installing extra
  differently-named versions of fonts #3 and #4 to appear as the independent bolds,
  but that conflicted with the already installed 'linked' bolds. This occurred even
  when I replaced the word 'bold' in the extra font with another word. I would really
  appreciate it if one of the kind type gurus here could help me solve this problem.\r\n\r\n"

    you want to have the fonts linked as bold versions 1>3 and 2>4, then fonts 3 and
    4 can NOT show up as separate fonts in typical Windows applications such as Word.
    Sad, but there it is. That's just how fonts work on Windows (at least in most
    Windows apps).\r\n\r\nIf you pick which you're willing to sacrifice, (A) style
    linking or (B) having four separate font menu entries on Windows, then we can
    give you more advice.\r\n\r\nAlso indicate what font format you're generating.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    - what's the use of having the cake if one cannot eat it? :) OK I understand what
    you are saying.  Preferably the font would work on both PC and on Macs, and I
    could generate it either as OT or TTF whatever works best- both formats seem to
    work well.  I forgot to add another preference- that Word be prevented from generating
    its own \"fake bolds\". \r\nWould it be too greedy of me to ask you to outline
    both scenarios (A) and (B)? Would it be the same for the Mac? This is my first
    digital font so your help is greatly appreciated.\r\nCheers\r\nV"

    method is your only option. This would be scheme A in the PDF (page 5, left column).\r\nThen,
    Word will show only Light and Regular in the font menu, while Semibold and Bold
    can be accessed via the Bold button. But you will see all four weights/styles
    in Adobe applications if you fill in \"OT Family Name\" and \"OT Style Name\"
    on the FontInfo's \"OpenType-specific font names\" page -- the \"OT Family Name\"
    should be the same for all four weights.\r\nCan you fill in the names and then
    post screenshots of the first two FontInfo pages, or send a link to a download
    of zip'ed screenshots? I think it'll be easier to spot what went wrong."

  body: "Thanks Karsten and Thomas I learned a lot. After much trial and error and
    a generous dose of beginner's luck, I managed to name the four fonts so that they
    appear as four separate entries in both Word and in Adobe applications. Fake bolds
    are blocked in all cases.  I am happy with this result on my XP but doubtless
    there may be pitfalls in other situations so your feedback is welcome.  Refering
    to the letters in red in the figure (the one shown is for the bold) I compiled
    a table of the various entries and the result in Word and Adobe menus.\r\n\r\nIn
    each case after filling items A B C L M I clicked \"Build Style Name\" then the
    rest of the names can be built automatically using the two diamonds shown. The
    numbers in (A) give the stem width of the font, and the ones in (L) reflect the
    weight increase, but I am not sure of their significance or   how they must be
    derived. \r\n\r\nI found that an important step to avoid errors is to go to the
    page \"Additional Open Type Names\" (not shown here) click the red X to delete
    any previous entries, then click the \"FI\" button to import names, then Apply/OK\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlQuds-naming_4523.jpg]"

    name because the numbers in each font name make (A) different each time.  I was
    not thinking too clearly when I asked about copyright - just wondering in general
    if the lack of a unified family name will cause any issues in marketing etc.\r\n\r\n>>>Create
    a Win/Mac Word document with the fonts, save it, then import it to Win/Mac InDesign.>>>\r\n\r\nYou
    were prescient about this - when I placed the Word document in InDesign, a fonts
    not found error message was given.  However the fonts automatically chosen for
    substitution where the correct ones.  This trouble is caused because of the double
    naming of a font as \"Regular\" and as \"Light/Regular/Semimold/Bold\"\r\n\r\nBy
    the way may I ask you to advise me about any special steps required to generate
    a font for the Mac?  Thanks again\r\n"

    be like a biology professor  having one his students invent their own taxonomy
    for the family, genus and species of some specimen brought to the lab.  On the
    other hand what could be more disturbing than the \"lie\" of having a user press
    the bold button in Word and seeing text appear with smudged ungainly outlines
    instead of the crisp ones painstakingly designed by the typographer?  \r\n\r\n>>>>I
    believe there\u2019s no good reason to punish savvy applications because of the
    limitations of typical Windows apps...[with fonts appearing] as a separate family
    in apps like InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator?>>>\r\n\r\nAgreed. In the naming
    experiment above (using Karsten's useful workaround for the Mac name), when a
    Word file using the four separately-named fonts was placed in IndDesign the Adobe
    application refused to recognize the AlQuds 240 Bold. But it worked when I renamed
    it AlQuds 240 Black.  I am sure other problems might also occur in other situations.
    \ \r\n\r\nPerhaps the best compromise is to have the fonts named as two families,
    Light and Normal, with a linked pair of fonts Regular/Bold in each family, named
    in the standard way. Pity, it was so nice seeing the four fonts listed by weight
    in the menus. \r\n\r\nI console myself by thinking that users of Windows apps
    are less likely to be as font-conscious as those using Adobe apps. I mean that
    following this latest suggestion, Word displays only two font weights; the other
    two will only appear as 'true' linked bolds."
