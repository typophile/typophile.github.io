body: There are so many companies online to purchase color printing from these days.  It
  seems like every few weeks, a new one pops up, undercutting the previously lowest
  priced printer.  We've had our share of good and nightmarish experiences.  Is there
  a printer(s) you would highly recommend?  Lets get some epinions!

    my wedding photo thank you cards.  Most of their designs and templates are for
    business but I was able to design something myself by uploading photos and whatnot.
    \ The quality was great and the price was unbeatable.  \r\n\r\nI think this is
    the postcards page or you can just click around to find them from the home page...

  body: "Because I live near their retail store (?!), I've used <a href=\"http://www.clubcardprinting.com/home.cfm\">Clubcard</a>
    which offers both 1-day turnaround on digital printing, and longer turnaround
    on my new favorite thing; hi-res stochastic screened offset. Gives amazingly crisp
    type and unbelievable detail for photos. The screening is so fine, you need higher-res
    digital images than with normal offset, or pixels will show. \r\n\r\nClubcard
    has a location in Vancouver as well as SF. Their presses aren't any trade secret,
    and actually their screening process isn't either (look around on their website).
    You could try to locate someone in your area that uses them.\r\n\r\nIf you work
    with Clubcard, do make sure to provide all the crops and marks, as they gang many
    jobs and aren't necessarily pampering your job when it's run. "
