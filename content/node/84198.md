body: "Hey everyone I'd much appreciate a bit of critique on this!\r\n\r\nThis is
  a logo for a former hardcore gangster rapper that is trying to revamp her identity
  as being much more mature, more sophisticated, and a bit more feminine. These possible
  logomarks are based on Battista, which is in turn based on Bodoni. I like what I
  have so far, but I want some critique on the letterforms. These are unfinished and
  I know there are some flaws in the technical exicution, but tha's ok at this stage.
  I'm mainly concerned about the \"G.\" I really like the way it is Option 1, but
  it doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the letter forms. Please let me know if
  there is anything I haven't caught that should be altered. Thanks!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/comps.jpg"

    try to make it a bit more legible (and maybe a bit more ornate too)."

  body: 'Mostly the ll pair, which I struggled to make sense of: together with the
    non-centred hyphen, they resemble maybe a deconstructed H or some unrecognised
    character.'

  body: "I agree with @riccard0. I tend to read the \"LL-E\" segment as \"THE\". Perhaps
    separating the hyphen from the second \"L\" will improve readability.\r\nAlso
    agree that the second version is the one to work on.\r\nYou may want to experiment
    with different ligatures to get a more dynamic look."

    Whataya think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comps2_3692.jpg]"

  body: The fine lines in 2 & 3 make me think of the rings of a cut off tree stump.  Not
    sure what that has to do with the concept.  I don't think I get the logic of the
    variation of fill in the letterforms.  Maybe something less rigid and more decorative
    would be fitting?  By that I mean more swashes and curly embellishments or something
    along those lines.  Or maybe even just really making those ligatures work.  I
    am just not feeling the D-o-l connections especially.  Hope that helps

  body: 'I agree that the thin lines within some of the letterforms are not really
    working. #3 is best but I''d try to simplify it - lose the thin lines hanging
    off the G and between the O and LL (makes it look like an e). Maybe fill in the
    terminals etc? '

  body: "You guys are right. I got a bit away from the original concept in which simplicity
    is very important. I got rid of all of the ligatures. and simplified the fills
    as well. (The fills in the last comps were done pretty hastily). Again, this is
    not rendered perfectly at this point (particularly in the fills and some line
    weights), but I think it's far enough to get a critique on how successful the
    letterforms are. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comps3_5212.jpg]"

  body: "Daniel,\r\nI think you're about a mile away from your brief and moving back
    and forth in four-foot increments. So you know that you're not alone, I get this
    feeling from the entire rapping visual arts scene. Generally speaking, there's
    no visual sophistication there.\r\nMy advice is that you get out of your studio
    and go for a walk to clear your mind of what you've done on the project already,
    perhaps to a library or art museum. Find some art that you feel is to the level
    your brief demands: the most mature, sophisticated, feminine art available. It
    need not be type-related. Then ask yourself why it accomplishes what it does,
    and what allows it to do this. If you will take your lessons as they come and
    begin to let them open your eyes, they'll see you through this little logotype
    exercise."
