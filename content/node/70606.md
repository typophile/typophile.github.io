  Gothic EF Bold, however if you look closely at the characters this is not so.  Does
  anyone have any ideas?\r\n\r\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/4159/fontar.jpg\r\n"

  body: "Thank you so much for your reply.  Is this the same font as: Univers ATT
    Bold?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask this is I already have Univers ATT Bold and it is
    a very near fit, but when I try to line the text up on the scanned image, the
    typed font seems wider spaced.  So is Univers ATT Bold the same as Univers Bold?"
