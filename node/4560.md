body: hello typophiles,  <BR> <BR>I have to design an outdoor equipment catalogue
  &#40;aprox. 240p/mid price level&#41;.  <BR>actually they use impact for headlines
  and weidemann for the body.  <BR> <BR>I think weidemann works well but what would
  you suggest for headlines and body. <BR> <BR>thanks, romesh

  body: Funny. Has mine beat. I was going to make a crack about &#34;outdoor equipment
    catalogue&#34;, that Romesh should make sure the paper was weatherproof, since
    the catalog is for outdoor use... <BR> <BR>Romesh, sorry for the jabs! Please,
    could you tell us more details, like the nature of the target customer? <BR> <BR>hhp
