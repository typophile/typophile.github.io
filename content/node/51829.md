body: "I was reading through the various threads on the ellipsis because a client
  asked for one that's not used for trailing thoughts, pausing or anything even remotely
  like that, though the appearance is similar. This... is to indicate the truncation
  (at some random word space), of a text leading to a link. This is now very commonly
  done in electronic compositions, as I think you can see here on Typophile. \r\n\r\nThe
  glyph design should be narrower and is not spaced to repeat, in the interest of
  allowing more words before the link. \r\n\r\nAnyone done this glyph? Is there a
  name for it yet? Or can we call it an ellipsumore?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Yeah, why not do a whole range of ellipsises\u2026\r\n\r\nLike, an optimistic
    one where the dots would follow an upward curve, and in contrast the dark version,
    where the last dot would be on descender level. Plus all possible variations,
    like the manic/depressed, where the first two dots would be way up there and the
    third\u2026 you\u2019ll catch my drift\u2026\r\n\r\nShould be doable, OpenType,
    I guess.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    in a font\u2014three dot, four dot leading with period, four dot leading with
    ellipsis. Now throw in a bang and a question mark into the mix.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t
    many faces use a tight ellipsis as the ellipsis character? I had this discussion
    at TypeCon."
