The printer claimed to not be able to open the file properly and that there wasn&#39;t any font files.&#40; Which is rubbish because I included a pdf, id file and the fonts.&#41; Anyway, they hashed it and swapped Times NR for my specified Vendetta, claiming that it &#34;pretty much looked the same&#34;.

		<div class="commentbody">One good,  ne excellent, reason to examine your own film. I&#39;m very used to doing my own film output, as we have the equipment in our offices.  <BR> <BR>Recently I had the press I use output the film for an oversized project and didn&#39;t think to examine the film. They gave me one of those new fangled digital proofs which I&#39;ve had ZERO experience with ... because again I&#39;m used to examining my own film and having the matchprints made directly from the film. I wasn&#39;t aware that the stairstepping was actually not a result of the digital proof but actually in my illustrator file. &#40;I am so used to outputting my own film and knowing what to watch for that I didn&#39;t know the red flags in this press&#39;s workflow.&#41; <BR> <BR>When I went in to discuss the problem with the pre-press department they told me point blank that the problem I had had wasn&#39;t something they watched for .... ARGH! The problem, was of course, the file not being set to a high enough resolution. I hadn&#39;t run into this problem in sooooo long it took me by surprise.  <BR> <BR>I call it a lesson learned. I don&#39;t know how to calibrate my film, or test the calibration of processed film, I trust someone else to do that for me. But I know bad type and bad shape and incorrect overprint/knockout when I see it.  <BR> <BR>More on topic, not many foundries support embedding into PDFs, let alone for service bureau output. But, those that do should be applauded and rewarded &#40;I don&#39;t know how&#41;.  <BR> <BR>One work-a-round that people should include to their service bureau ... laser proofs. Even if you just give them composite prints. I would think that they wouldn&#39;t want to give you film that didn&#39;t work if you can show them how you know it should look in the end.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My experience with pdfs is more like Tiffany&#39;s. I wish I knew more about the issue  <BR>of support for embedding in pdfs. I often modify my font set to default to old style  <BR>figs and so on -- does this affect it? And yes, I always provide laser proof as well  <BR>as an admonition to the printer not to substitute fonts, but some will not believe I  <BR>can tell the difference until I catch them at it.</div>
