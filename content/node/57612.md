    sixteen-line, eight-line & twelve lines in these samples, what does it refer to?
    I guess it is something to do with size, but how does it differ from point size?"

  body: "Seems like the typeface name is \"Perspective\" by Bower & Bacon from 1837(?),
    according to the picture. I have seen this typeface before, but I can't remember
    where. There is a showing of a type called Perspective No.1 in the Solotype Catalog,
    but it isn't this typeface. This is another case where maybe Mark Simonson can
    use his library to help us with more information.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    (I'm a student of the Royal Art Academy in The Hague). I'll ask my friends tomorrow.

    were Gill, not Futura (makes a lot more sense too)."
