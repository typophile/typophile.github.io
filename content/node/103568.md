  body: "@cheri.dieringer: can't find a match but really doubt there's a perfect one
    for your sample. To me, it looks like a techy freebie customized (mainly adding
    top serifs, redrawing some finials and angles and may be slanting it). As usual
    for ths kind of job, having a look to [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno
    > Sci-fi]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]] DaFont
    sections might be helpful to spot a good candidate for customization ([[http://www.dafont.com/dream-mma.font|Dream
    MMA]], [[http://www.dafont.com/xscale.font|Xscale]]...). Good hunting :)\r\n\r\n@son0fhobs:
    to start a new thread go [[http://typophile.com/typeid|here]] and below \"Type
    ID Board\" top main heeder, you'll find \"Post new Forum topic\".\r\nFor the ID,
    sorry but I wasn't able to spot a match. Here's a reworked sample though, some
    might help you.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sharing-is-sexy_5790.jpg]"
