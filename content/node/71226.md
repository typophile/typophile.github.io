body: "I'm writing my Ph.D. thesis (in maths), and I'm having a hell of a time trying
  to find the best page layout. The thesis will be printed on A4 paper, double-sided
  and in book form.\r\n\r\nNormal font is Adobe Caslon Pro at 11/13.6 (the 13.6pt
  leading will be changed to something else later...this is just what LaTeX uses).
  At 11pt, that's roughly 128pt for the size of the alphabet. The textblock is currently
  set at around 30 picas, which is about 80 characters/line. \r\n\r\nI've tried various
  page layout templates (from the memoir package of LaTeX), including the medieval
  layout and Binghurt's ISO layout, but I've been unsatisfied with all of them (their
  textblock widths are too large and heights are too small) Basically, I'm looking
  for something with a smaller textblock, but still preserving a decent amount of
  height. \r\n\r\nCan someone suggest a better page layout? \r\n\r\nSee the attached
  file for a sample of what I have. The file has a lot of text. The second file has
  more maths, which is more typical."

    Does your university?

    for the most aesthetically pleasing layout. "

  body: "This isn't bad. \r\n\r\nFirst off: I'd definitely lose the Zapfino. Frankly,
    it looks out of place \u2013 like a desperate attempt to instill some dramatic
    aesthetics on something that's so smart that I'd think it should be allowed to
    look mostly serious. :-)\r\n\r\nAlso: This would benefit from more leading, also
    because your line length is a bit long (something that's very hard to avoid on
    A4 size paper). More leading can compensate for that, to a degree, to make reading
    more effortless. Try giving it more air, like 15 or maybe even 16. See what happens.
    If this takes up too much space maybe you can give your text blocks a little more
    height, and/or decrease point size a tiny bit. "

  body: "I think the page layout is good, except for the leading. I agree with Nina,
    14.5 or 15pt would work better.\r\n\r\nBut I definitively would avoid traditional
    old style numbers in a Maths work. I think they disturb the flow of reading when
    there are heavy numeric usage with the text. Tiempos would be a perfect alternative
    to Caslon."

  body: "Nina & Freiberger, thank you both for the comments. \r\n\r\n> First off:
    I'd definitely lose the Zapfino. \r\n\r\nNina, I thought it looked nice...until
    I got a what-was-I-thinking moment. You're absolutely right and it clashes with
    the subject matter. I will have to mull over a better chapter heading. For the
    moment, I've gone back to something simple.\r\n\r\n> But I definitively would
    avoid traditional \r\n> old style numbers in a Maths work.\r\n\r\nOldstyle is
    only used for when the fonts are typeset outside of the maths environment. So
    the Caslon numbers will only be used in section and figure headings. I think it's
    okay. I'll keep it in mind though. It's an easy fix.\r\n\r\n> I think the page
    layout is good, except for the leading. \r\n> I agree with Nina, 14.5 or 15pt
    would work better.\r\n\r\nI've changed it to 14.5pt leading. I've also changed
    the page proportions to something I think looks better (but I'm unsure). It goes
    like this:\r\n\r\nTypeblock: width = 27 picas, ratio = 2:1\r\nOuter margin to
    inner margin = 2:1\r\nLower margin to upper margin = 2:1\r\n\r\nThe tradeoff is
    that there are really (really!) wide margins. What do you guys think? \r\n\r\n[[http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trinh/temp/out1.pdf|New
