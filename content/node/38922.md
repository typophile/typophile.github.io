  you also missed the category "Knowledge of Fonts" in Double Jeopardy. The answer
  to the $2000 clue (which no one rang in for) was Bodoni. '

  body: 'Something like, "This font is named after an Italian printer who pioneered
    the style in the late-18th century." The clue was set in Bodoni, too. '

  body: Ah... so the Type ID board should have been called in. I guess Bodoni is too
    obscure for the masses. Do you remember any of the other questions/answers?

  body: "One was like \"The name of this typeface comes from the Latin for 'Swiss'\",
    and the clue was set in Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAnother was \"Sans-serif types, sometimes
    called grotesques, are also known by this spooky architectural term\". Another
    showed Wingdings and asked what the typface was. And I think the first one asked
    something about cursive fonts. "

    crap, Bodoni\"....  ;-)\r\n\r\nKinda fun though."

  body: "I thought it was interesting that they broke style and presented the Helvetica
    and Bodoni clues in those respective typefaces. They don't usually break style
    in clues. (In category headings, they will occasionally break style for special
    \"sponsored\" or \"partnered\" ones -- like the NYT categories). \r\n\r\nThe last
    clue referenced the face, of course, \"This font ...\"; but the Helvetica clue
    was not dependent upon being set in Helvetica, and yet it was. (Good thing they
    didn't set the entire Wingdings clue in Wingdings -- \xE0 la Carson ;-)\r\n\r\n--

    like Helvetica and see who can make the best use of it. Or something like that.
