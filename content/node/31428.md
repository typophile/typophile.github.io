  body: The script font for <em>restaurants</em> gave me a Bickham Script vibe, but
    after looking, there are some differences. It's similar, but unfortunately I'm
    no help.

  body: "Yep, it's gotta be Kuenstler. But check out this frame grab from a different
    region of her nav bar:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fili2_4901.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    looks like she's modified at least one of the characters. Compare her P with the
    commercial version from Font Shop:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fili3_3694.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    think her revision makes the P more readable, particularly at such a small size.
    Don't you just love attention to detail?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for helping. As
    always, amazing work!"

  body: I don't have the font, but it's very likely that there are multiple glphys
    available via OpenType. She most likely used an alternate version of the 'p' which
    was more suited to be the first letter.

  body: "A different foundry could very well be. But how many times would a pirated
    font include more alternatives than the original? I can't imagine that would be
    the default glyph for the character, as it won't work set after another letter
    (it doesn't seem to me like they would join... maybe an optical illusion?). It
    wouldn't be the first time I've been proven wrong though.\r\n\r\nAn even less
    likely possibility would be that is how the lowercase <em>p</em> renders at a
    smaller size. "

  body: "The letter that made me uncertain was the leading 'r' and its up-stroke from
    the baseline. I thought it could be an alternate glyph, but when I looked at the
    Character Set at FontShop it didn't show any. Although I'm unsure if the FontShop
    Character Set is meant to be all-encompassing? But then 'Set' would imply that
    it is, no? \r\n\r\nI guess it's simple enough to modify the 'r' in this way, and
    I think it works better this way as a leading letter. Makes it seem more considered. "
