    to attend TypeCon in Los Angeles last year to meet with Doyald one last time.
    As others have said, he was a kind and generous man. I will treasure the few interactions
    and correspondences we did have."

  body: I was very impressed by his tale (at TypeCon Buffalo?) of how he got into
    the business, IIRC he rode the rods to the West coast during the depression and
    ended up at school there learning lettering by making drawings from big specimen
    letters of Caslon. Some element of chance, walking down the street, figured into
    it too. Did I get that right, or is it just a romantic memory?

    the story he told me was while he was working the rails he entered a fashion illustration

  body: "I\u2019ve had the great pleasure of meeting Doyald Young on a few occasions:
    at Hermann Zapf\u2019s 87th birthday in 2005, at the TypeCon conference in Buffalo,
    NY in 2008, and again at TypeCon in Los Angeles last year. I\u2019ve exchanged
    some wonderful e-mails with him over the years. \r\n\r\nOnce, he most kindly drew
    a custom logo for my then-girlfriend\u2019s jewelry brand \u2014 as a gesture
    of appreciation for my bit of assistance with the production of his fonts. Doyald
    could draw the sexiest letterforms. To me, they were a perfect embodiment of femininity.
    This somewhat surprised me when I realized that Doyald preferred Michelangelo\u2019s
    David over Venus de Milo. But perhaps this should not be surprising. Grace, finesse
    and beauty are of in any way to be confined to clich\xE9s. \r\n\r\nDoyald Young
    has authored several books: \u201CLogotypes & Letterforms\u201D (1993), ,\u201CFonts
    & Logos\u201D (1999) and \u201CDangerous Curves: Mastering Logotype Design\u201D
    (2008). He was working on his next book about the lettering of the English formal
    script, although I am not sure whether he managed to finish it. \r\n\r\nIt was
    due to his \u201CDangerous Curves\u201D book that I came up with a stunt at the
    TypeCon 2010 conference in Los Angeles. At the same hotel venue as the conference,
    a Playboy charitable event was being held. So after the presentation of the SoTA
    Award to Doyald, I\u2019ve grabbed him and escorted him to the stand where the
    Playboy bunnies were accepting donations, and arranged an impromptu photoshoot
    of Doyald, his \u201CDangerous Curves\u201D book and, well, some \u201Cdangerous
    curves\u201D of a different kind. \r\n\r\nI think Doyald did not quite appreciate
    the stunt at the beginning. I apologized to him, and he explained to me that it
    was not him but Stefan Bucher suggested the title of the book \u2014 \u201Cas
    in Gina Lollobrigida\u201D, Stefan said. Doyald himself felt that \u201Cas for
    the stunt, I thought that I\u2019d be a sport and do it, though on reflection
    I see no value in it for me. I\u2019m stuffy and conservative and not much interested
    in camp, irony, or wit. I hope that my book is now not seen a manual of sex.\u201D
    \r\n\r\nI\u2019m certain that this will never be the case. When I wrote to Doyald
    that I saw the value of the stunt in contrasting the cheap and superficial Playboy
    bunny outfits that so unsuccessfully aspired to be \u201Cdangerous curves\u201D
    with the true beauty and mastery delivered by Doyald, he did, after all, agree,
    and laughed about it. \r\n\r\nAfter meeting Doyald on several occasions, I cannot
    concur with his own estimation of being \u201Cstuffy\u201D and \u201Cnot much
    interested in irony or wit\u201D. I think he was just too modest \u2014 yet when
    talking to him, I could see a person who was full of warm-hearted humor, great
    positive energy, and true talent which was so deservedly and widely appreciated.
    \r\n\r\nAs already mentioned in this thread, Lynda.com recently made a 40-minutes
    documentary about Doyald Young. It\u2019s beautifully shot, and certainly worth
    watching (non-native English speakers are encouraged to turn on the \u201CCC\u201D
    subtitles). Here\u2019s the video: \r\nhttp://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=75866\r\n\r\nI
    also recommend reading the piece that Doyald\u2019s good friend Marian Bantjes
    wrote about him: \r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/medalist-doyaldyoung\r\n\r\nThank
    you, Doyald, for your wit, your wisdom, your attention to detail, and all the
    dangerous curves you have discovered and presented to all of us. \r\n\r\n\u2014
