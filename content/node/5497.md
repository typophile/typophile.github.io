  <BR>It reminds me of DINSchrift, but I don&#39;t know because it&#39;s rounded.

    Can anyone confirm this? <BR> <BR>Anyway, sorry for the newbie question, but why
    does this have 1451 in the name like &#40;for example&#41; DIN1451? What&#39;s
    the significance of the 1451?'

  body: From my priceless Emigre magazine issue 13 &#40;1989&#41;  <BR>&#34;Redesigning
    Stereotypes&#34;, the contribution by Erik <BR>Spiekermann contains some information
    on DIN. DIN is  <BR>the German Industrial Norm. This norm quantizes loads  <BR>of
    different items, which each get their DIN number,  <BR>probably to allow to identify
    and catalogue them. Both  <BR>the popular industrial typeface <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-1451/"
    target="_blank"> DIN Mittelschrift</a> and the  <BR>Isonorm typeface for technical
    drawings seem to carry  <BR>number 1451.
