    you mix the styles, and use the italic for the y, that might be it.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks similar to, but not quite like ITC Bauhaus:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bauhaus/"

  body: "I think \"mix the styles\" was the key. That y looks like the one from the
    alternate set for [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/avant_garde_gothic_extra_light_alternate_ot/|Avant
    Garde Gothic]]. Other letters could be from Chalet/Bauhaus, and others from that
    design style/era, including maybe Futura.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
