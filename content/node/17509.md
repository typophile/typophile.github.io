  am trying to modify a font (substitute two characters) and I am curious as to how
  to go about doing this in the most efficient manner possible... The font in question
  is a font that was created in /for Mac. I'm trying to alter this font for a professor
  whose collegues and herself only use Macs in order to be on the same page document
  wise as this is a differently charactered alphabet. \r\n\r\nReading up on the Mac
  OS it looks like the Fontbook feature \"automate\" enables the /scanning in/ of
  fonts... is this true, does it work the way it sounds? (Scan in and assign each
  character to the map?)\r\n\r\nAny help you can offer is greatly appreciated, don't
  assume that I know anything overly complicated as I'm a complete noob as far as
  font manipulation goes. The kicker is as well that I can't even open the font on
  the PC to attempt a unicode version or some other version that'll work with their
  Macs...\r\n\r\nTherese\r\n\r\n"

  body: When Font Book "scans" a font, it is simply checking it over making sure its
    not corrupt and gathering information about the font so it's ready to install.
    The only thing it can do to a font is install it. You can't use it to reassign
    characters or anything like that.

  body: Ok, found a little more info- This is a True Type font, made for Mac. Any
    PC font editor (shareware or trial so I can test it out) that will let me open
    this?

    is a program that converts between Mac and PC and all kinds of different font
    formats. I''ve used it in the past and been very happy with the results; that
    said I wasn''t using it very much or using many features. Anyone else have a good
    app?'

    gotten me on the road to success with this one- thank you so much!

  body: Glad it suits your purpose. My only caution would be that Mac font files go
    corrupt even easier in a PC file system - sometimes they will corrupt just from
    being left in the same place for too long (disk fragmenting? I dunno). So make
    <em>multiple</em> backups!

  body: Really?? That seems so odd... lucky for me that the font is only going to
    be used on Macs, not for PC then. ^_^ . I will copy it on disks and such all over
    the place though. Haven't heard back yet if the font works  yet or not, high hopes!
    Thank you again, so so much!

  body: "Two things:\r\n\r\nMac font suitcases use a file structure that is not recognized
    by Windows systems. Thus, if you copy a Mac font suitcase to a PC and back, part
    of the file may be lost in the transition, leaving you with a damaged (corrupt)
    font.\r\n\r\nIn the Mac OS before OS X, the font suitcases of active fonts were
    open for read/write all the time the system was running. If there was a crash,
    open documents could be corrupted. This was the most common cause of corrupt fonts.
    There may be other ways that fonts (or any other files) may become corrupted,
    but I have not seen this problem come up very often on OS X."

    body: I followed the instructions as far as 'unstuffing' the font to preserve
      the 'resource' fork- will this help eliminate this problem? Could I send  you
      the altered font to try out, as I don't have a mac...?
