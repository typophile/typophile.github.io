  body: 'Futura works much better, but the Caps do need more spacing and you should
    kern the letters manually. Nobel and especially Neutraface would be less-overused
    alternatives.  <BR>Btw, I&#39;m not sure the way you have something in every corner
    really looks elegant or simple. '

  body: yup, kerning is the term used when the spacing between type caracters is adjusted
    to get consistent and even letter spacing. <BR> <BR>

  body: HD, Neutraface is an excellent suggestion. Give it a unique look. Greg I don&#39;t
    follow the logo/monogram on the lower left. I can make out the G and thats it.

  body: hd, i was excpecting that reaction. and I understand it.  actually I never
    studied graphics or design. let&#39;s say I studied everything i know by myself,
    but never digged enough the filed of typography &#40;badbad i know&#41;. I expect
    from this forum to learn more about it. You can judge if I can call me a  designer
    or not by surfing my website. <BR>...

    a look at your site. why not use a detail of the dome/weathervane image as a background
    for your card, nicely cropped?

  body: 'well, regarding those legibility issues, I&#39;m also starting a new logo
    for a webdesign company called GWS and the concept is very simmilar. I don&#39;t
    mind that the logo can&#39;t really output the GWS on the first look &#40;this
    is a topic on it&#39;s own&#41;. I tend to understand this kind of logos as a
    brand, a symbol... what can you read on this, <BR>&#40;no way the angles &amp;
    thickness are finals, just a sketch&#41;: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/18699.gif"

    you&#39;re going with your logo, however at first glance i read QUE.  <BR>The
    W really makes me think an &#34;U&#34; maybe because of the horizontal line going
    on the right below the &#34;S&#34;.  <BR>I think the way the middle line of the
    &#34;S&#34; ends &#40;going up&#41; doesn&#39;t help the legibility of an &#34;S&#34;
    but seems more an &#34;E&#34;. <BR>... but I think you&#39;re on the right way.

    millions of dollars on branding you should keep it a bit simpler. Remember in
    this world of the internet the attention span is about 3 seconds. '

  body: I have one other thought Greg, instead of printing your logo either blind
    emboss it or a heated stamp on a paper with a linen finish, very classy.
