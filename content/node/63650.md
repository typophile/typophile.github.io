  body: "Joe,\r\n\r\nIts hard to figure out why you think this is spam? CATC is a
    reputable design college in Australia. All sblackwell is doing it seems is sharing
    creativity and trying to get feedback on a proposed rebrand for the college. Surely
    you cannot be serious in thinking this is some kind of marketing ploy do you?
    Plus you have a crack at the moderators...you sound like an angry little man to
    me.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n"
