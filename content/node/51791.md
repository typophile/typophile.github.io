    I'd have to review the Dwiggin's letters, by which I mean correspondence. I think
    his call for "crisp finish" would apply to roman or ital equally. You'd like it,
    Hrant. It could be seen as move from chirography towards the "machine age" as
    it was then seen.

    were chirographic his experiments and interest in the production process probably
    led him away from purely chirographic forms."

  body: "I would suggest that this is the flip side of the coin of how  experimental
    he was. Not every experiment yields fruit, or at least the fruit we expect. That's
    how I reconcile it or, more properly, explain it. He explored some hypotheses
    and found them incorrect.\r\n\r\nIn the case you cite, he wondered if Uncial forms
    would be more \"natural\" for the reading of English, thinking that the Latin
    forms would be better suited for, well, Latin presumably, and I guess the romance
    languages..  So he experimented to see if Winchester Uncial would yield revolutionary
    results in legibility in setting English. It didn't and he said so, but Winchester
    without the uncial forms is actually a really charming face and he did some great
    work in Hingham with it. I don't think the digital versions really do it justice.\r\n\r\nTruly,
    Hrant, WAD was a kindred soul to you. He worried about and was involved in every
    step of type production; he took careful consideration of legibility AND readability;
    he wasn't afraid to explore radical ideas (including the abandonment of many chirographic
    forms). \r\n\r\n[As an aside, weren't uncial forms originally Roman anyway and
    brought to the British Isles during the Roman occupation? They may have then hit
    an artistic peak as Insular majascule etc,... but it seems like WAD was really
    off base on that one.]\r\n"

    in [[http://typophile.com/node/41365|this thread]] I quoted Dwiggins from 1947,

    to beauty of appearance or to mechanical felicity. Legibility is the basic law,

    I had originally thought one of the heavier condensed [newspaper headline] styles.
    I also thought maybe one of the heavier italics, which get funky and chunky (Cyrus
    called them \"tasty\"). But after that rich, chewy Beorcana, I thought in the
    end that something light and airy might be a nice change, and so I suggested the
    Light Italic.\r\n\r\nHrant -- I was being only half-serious (and taking you only
    half-seriously), thus the smiley. No worries.\r\n\r\nRegarding WAD, I think I
    would agree with that he was very instinctive in his work. And at the same time,
    he was very thoughtful. I think his thinking tended to follow his instincts. He
    could indeed be very right in his instincts and at the same time amazingly off-base
    in some of his ideas. But that is part of being a great thinker. \r\n\r\nDwiggins
    was a complicated mix of thinking and feeling, contemporary urges and historical
    respect. He even makes fun of himself in this regard through his alter-ego, H.
    P\xFCterschein. In the Caledonia specimen, in \"Notes on the Designer\" Dwiggins-as-P\xFCterschein
    writes about Dwiggins-the-designer, protesting that he is not really very \"modern\"
    at all: \r\n\r\n\"He creates an illusion of machines. But his machines are a masquerade.
    There are men inside of them. [. . .] Dwiggins pretends to love steel. He deceives
    nobody who <em>thinks</em> steel. He deceives his friends -- Victorians like himself.
    He does not deceive <em>me</em>. . . . Dwiggins loves the forms of his youth --
    split-rail fences, the dust of the road, shady farm-lanes, hills, clouds, sunshine,
    rain, a simple breed of semi-barbaric rural morons -- all the sentimental hogwash
    of the days when he was young.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a complicated and contradictory

    he was also always saying to Griff -- You tell me if there's any value in continuing
    this, or just put it \"in the attic\" (as he would say).\r\n\r\nThing is, as evidenced

    it's not really THAT contradictory. His instincts led him to want to try out many

    and thoughtful nature. We can snort in derision at some ideas, but that's always

    impulses. He also respected WAD's analyses and theories. He was often asking WAD's
    opinion about other faces in production or sending him articles to comment on.\r\n\r\nHe
    did not always agree with all of WAD's theories. (I'm thinking about the long
    debate regarding approaches to fitting that I alluded to in another thread.) And
    I think CHG undoubtedly felt that some of WAD's design experiments were pretty
    outlandish, being a pretty practical man himself. But clearly, he felt that there
    was great value in having someone relatively unfettered in the MLCo camp doing
    the equivalent of \"R&D.\" In this regard, I think Griff deserves a lot of credit
