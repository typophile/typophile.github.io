  body: "Welcome to Typophile. Sansarah is not a bad choice, but I looked through
    almost 3000 hand lettered informal fonts and couldn't find an exact match. (I
    looked at Dafont and Abstract Fonts to cover the freebies that are easier to search;
    I checked the ClickArts set that is widely used, and I scanned over 800 'informal
    handwriting' fonts on MyFonts.)\r\n\r\nThe most similar styles (all at MyFonts)
    I saw were from FontGarden: FG Abby and FG Erin, and Murbia from PizzaDude.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem with this sort of font, as our FAQ states, is that this kind of font can
    be made by literally anyone, and very cheaply, so there are many thousands of
    them. Finding an exact match takes as much luck as skill.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
