  m looking for a specific design/typography style that i came across the other day.\r\n\r\nI
  m  quite confident that by reading this, most of you will know what i m talking
  about.\r\n\r\nI believe that a lot of you out there, have come across with this
  \"Blocky/Bold Font design concept\". Mostly found on club flyers. Imagine a typography
  poster with red background and white font (quite blocky font actually). Most people
  tend to treat the message like a big square.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Is there a
  name for this typographic treatment, or its just called Typography? Also does anyone
  know of any designers that have used this style successfully?\r\n\r\nI hope i ve
  managed to make my self understood. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\nMarios"

  body: "Hi there eliason,\r\n\r\nI'm not really looking for blocky fonts. Although
    i do appreciate your reply.\r\n\r\nI m looking of the name of this style/technique
    that uses blocky/bold fonts.\r\n\r\nImagine this is a poster or a flier. The designer
    would use the fonts like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS IS WHAT\r\nI AM LOOKING\r\nFOR.
    IT SOME\r\nTIMES LOOKS\r\nLIKE A WALL\r\nOF FONTS.\r\n\r\nI m asking for the name
    of this technique (if there is one), or designers that used it.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nMarios\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the technique you're describing is done something like this:\r\n\r\n1.
    Establish your measure (the width of your line) and raise the point size of your
    first line of type until it equals the measure. Do the same with subsequent lines.
    Note that size of the type will vary from line to line. By manually breaking the
    copy, you can control the degree to which the sizes vary.\r\n\r\n2. Adjust the
    leading (or space after) the first line so that the space between the first two
    lines interacts (colors) evenly with the letter spaces and word spaces of both
    lines (which will be different as they are a function of the size of the type).
    Then adjust the space between all subsequent lines to be optically equal to the
    space between the first two lines.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you can't really control
    with this technique is the overall depth of the column of type. "

  body: Oh, and for a more art-deco feel, vary the tracking on each line rather than
    the point size.
