  body: "thanks so far!\r\n\r\ni think both were good suggestions, but both were also
    wrong. i will provide another picture where it becomes more obvious. The company
    is Bank Vontobel, btw.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ar_4038.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    can not be Stone Sans because of the cut of the uppercase A, it can not be Syntax
    because of the upercase R's straight leg...."
