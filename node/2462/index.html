  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, <BR> <BR>I've a quick query about a typeface I designed about a year ago ( <a href="http://www.overnightdesign.co.uk/aerobic" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.overnightdesign.co.uk/aerobic">http://www.overnightdesign.co.uk/aerobic</a></a> ) <BR> <BR>It was my first stab at a full character set so I though I'd build a small site around it and let folk download it if they wanted. There was no copyright information on the site or in the zipped font files. So far so good . . .  <BR> <BR>Then the other day I noticed a post on a news board about a club in the states  ( <a href="http://www.crobar.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.crobar.com">www.crobar.com</a></a> ) that had just been re-branded (posted by the guy who designed the new logo). This new identity basically consists of the word Crobar set in aerobic (my typeface). I checked that they were both the same and found the match to be pretty much perfect. <BR> <BR>What irritated me was not that the designer in question had used the font as part of the logo but that he had simply used the typeface and added nothing to it, passing it off as his own work and hadn't dropped me a line to ask if it was ok to do so. <BR> <BR>Do I have any kind of ownership of intellectual property or anything over my work or was this  wavered when I made the face available for download on the site. <BR> <BR>Sorry if this seems like a bit of a whine but it irritates me to think that another person is essentially passing off something I spent a considerable ammount of time on as their own. <BR> <BR>Any advice welcome. <BR> <BR>Barrie <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22630.gif" alt="comparison of logo and typeface"></div>

At least that's the message I get.</div>

Copyright law exists on the web as it does on paper. However, your sight clearly says 'no copyright' so maybe you should be a bit more explicit as to what you want your license agreement to be. I did notice your readme file says 'for personal use only' so I think, technically, you're in the right. YOu just may want to make that a bit clearer on your actual page.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I love the font and the website&hellip;it's rad! <BR> <BR>As for the copyright, you do have copyright for things you create (and I'm almost positive that even by adding a stylistic &quot;No Copyright&quot; to your site doesn't erase this). However, I think that because he has created something as well, it would be considered a new work and therefore have its own copyright. It's like collage art: the new piece is considered its own creation even though it contains the elements of other copyrighted works. However, there have been many cases where the use of a single item as the major feature of a work has led to copyright violation, so this might be the case with your situation. Unfortunately, this would be a situation that rides the fence and might need to be taken to some sort of judicial proceeding to actually get sorted out. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is a special case in that it's a typeface, which doesn't have quite the same copyright protection that drawings, photographs, and stories do. If you had put any of those things on your site and someone made a derivative work from them, that would be a violation. To be realistic, if you say a font is free to use, you have to expect people to set words in it for design purposes, otherwise what is a font for? <BR> <BR>But, venturing out of the realm of the question asked and into the minefield&hellip; I can tell a difference between the two. The crobar weight is slightly lighter and there are a few subtle proportional differences. And don't hate me for saying this, but it's made of circles. Parallel invention of simple forms such as these cannot be ruled out. There is a good possibility that they never saw your typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think there's a confusion here between assessing the fairness/legality of the Crobar logo, and assessing the designer's skill.  <BR> <BR>There's no question that the use of Barrie's font is legal. There was no EULA stating otherwise, and there's no law that prohibits a designer from using a font as-is in a logotype. <BR> <BR>Barrie seems to feel that it was lame of the designer to not adjust or customize anything. Fine, but that's just a judgment of the designer's skill and of the finished product &ndash; no legal issue is involved. Besides, it's conceivable that the &quot;as-is&quot; logotype might be the best solution for the project. It wouldn't make sense to have to alter the type just for the sake of altering the type. <BR> <BR>(On another topic, I wholeheartedly agree with Tiffany about encouraging the use of colophons in publications. I'm always disappointed when there's not one.)</div>
