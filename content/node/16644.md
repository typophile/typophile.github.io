    the word \"type\", as you can look up dictionaries http://www.answers.com/topic/type\r\na
    type-face has to have some sort of consistency in the shapes of all the glyphs,
    in other words characters in an alphabet have anatomies in which one can see identical
    forms. Design the space delimited by your outlines.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

    body: Alessandro, are you trying to say that the type is not consistent enough
      for your liking?

      it is not very constructive for what I'm trying to develop which doesn't necessary
      involve identical forms but yes, I'm working on consistency.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTalita\r\n"

  body: "Talita Machado, I meant to work on the black of your letters, since you want
    to call it \"typeface\", yes more consistency could help you.\r\nAmy Conger don't
    read in between the lines, also if I was purist that is not a type, and it is
    not important if I like it or not. There are repetition of forms in Nature on
    a macro-micro scale.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"
