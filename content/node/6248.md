  body: Dang. I&#39;ve got a list of 15 fonts I&#39;d call &#34;latin casuals&#34;  <BR>and
    none of them matches this thing. Give me a few hours.

    it&#39;s all yours.

  body: Ahaaa! <BR>So you have a custom type classification system going, and that&#39;s
    how you ID things so quickly. <BR> <BR>If this is the case, and it actually works
    for non-traditional stuff &#40;basically most of what was made in the past 15
    years&#41;, I think it would be the only one of its kind... Publish it, please!
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Let me ask you then, how many do you have under &#34;Latin
    Slab&#34;? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I&#39;d like to publish it, Hrant. I was discouraged for a while  <BR>by the
    launch of <a href="http://www.fontscape.com" target="_blank">Fontscape</a>. But
    that place is limited to  <BR>the fonts in their directory, and some of the categories  <BR>are
    very questionable and  <a href="http://www.fontscape.com/explore?7AI" target="_blank">too
    broad</a>. <BR> <BR>Show me what you mean by &#34;Latin Slab&#34; and I&#39;ll
    check.

  body: None of the Fontscape schemes are morphological. <BR>Like &#34;Latin Casual&#34;
    is right on, even though it supposes you know some traditional terms. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>Patria would be a rigid example, and de Groot&#39;s Floris a softer one
    &#40;although there are much softer ones&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Some of <a href="http://www.fontscape.com/explore?7AR" target="_blank">these</a>
    are morphological, no?   <BR>   <BR>Fontscape also has the advantage of font specimens
    all    <BR>on the same page, whereas I&#39;d have to link to samples    <BR>&#40;unless
    I wanted to go to the trouble to get agreements   <BR>from font vendors and host
    images&#41;.   <BR>   <BR>Latin slabs: Most of my lists are for display typefaces.   <BR>Now,
    if I got paid for it, I would be much more inclusive...'
