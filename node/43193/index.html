  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm curious to know how you learned the [[alphabet]] in school. You know, the selection and order of the letters used to teach children the official alphabet in your country/region - what might be on top of the blackboard in first grade ;-)

This to get an overview over what may be considered separate basic letters in your language - it could perhaps be useful for a type specimen/sample directed towards specific languages?

So when learning the german alphabet at school the three diacritic letters are bolted on at the end of the A-Z, and the ß is of course a special case?
I was afraid this might get complicated (I'm anxiously awaiting the status of e.g. the Ññ for spanish ;-)

Yes, I have looked at wikipedia (which e.g. says that portuguese has 23 letters - omitting KWY), but... with wikipedia being wikipedia, what I'm looking for is firsthand experiences of what you actually learned at school :-)</div>

A few letters from the standard Latin alphabet creep into use for modern and anglicised words. We don’t strictly learn this alphabet in school – generally it is the English alphabet that is taught. I could go off on a rant – but I’ll bite my lip.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>«Danish: 29 letters => ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZÆØÅ»</cite>

Growing up, I was always taught in school that the Danish alphabet has only 28 letters, w not being part of it; but this seems to have changed recently. Even <em>Retskrivningsordbogen</em> now has a separate entry for w, which it did not before.

I’m glad of this, by the way, since lumping w in with v never made sense to me.

&nbsp;

<cite>«Gaeilge: 18(23) letters=> ABCDEFGHILMNOPRSTU(ÁÉÍÓÚ)»</cite>

What is the status of h as a letter in Gaeilge? J, k, q, v, w, x, y, and z are only used in foreign words and are not counted as parts of the actual <em>aibítir</em>, but then again, the same goes for h, doesn’t it? The only indigenous word I can think of that contains an h would be <em>hurlamaboc</em> (and that’s an onomatopoeia, barely an actual word)—is one word really enough to consider h a separate Irish letter, rather than a function?</div>

No, they’re not all considered basic letters, only the letters without diacritics are. And unlike in Spanish where Ll, Ñ, and Rr are considered separate letters (though Rr is sometimes an exception; it also never occurs initially, and thus has no separate dictionay entry), the Portuguese equivalents of these letters, Lh, Nh, and Rr, are considered regular digraphs, too, not individual letters. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_alphabet#Basic_digraphs">Wikipedia article</a>)

&nbsp;

And yes, Gaeilge (or Gaedhilge, Gaedhilg, Gaoluinn, Gaolainn, etc.) is Irish Gaelic, pronounced [ˈɡɛɪlɪk]. Scottish Gaelic, pronounced [ˈɡa(:)lɪk], would be Gàidhlig (interestingly, unlike the Irish, they don’t seem too keen on having half a bazillion different names for their own language). :-)

pattyfab: adding esperanto, even though it came from a non-native speaker ;-)
I thought the diacritics was pronounciation related, but apparently they're not.
(And might I add: the lowercase ĥ is a nightmare to fit into the design of a font ;-)

loremipsum: Wow! Are all those considered separate letters? None are e.g. accented for modified pronounciation or something? So a child listing the alphabet has to differenciate between -let me count- 46 letters while learning their A to Z !?
Asking because Wikipedia only lists the non-accented letters: <cite>The lexicographic ordering of the Slovak alphabet is very similar to that of English: A B C D DZ E F G H CH I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z. The complete alphabet, however, allows for characters with diacritics.</cite> So, 28 letters... Sounds simpler, but I'm not slovak ;-)

Also I'm intrigued by the double letters that are considered as a single entry in the alphabetical order. Fascinating stuff, this. :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Roger, my list is actually copied from Slovak wiki:
http://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenská_abeceda

It's 46 letters. Yes, children must learn to read and write them all in the 1st school year.

The letters represent different sounds.

á, é, í, ó, ú, ý are long sounds for a, e, i, o, u, y
E. g. Slovak ice-hockey player Marian Gaborik (Minnesota) is actually Marián Gáborík, pronounced Maria:n Ga:bori:k
ĺ, ŕ are long sounds for l, r. Although r is pronounced very differently from English r, difference in length between r and ŕ is similar to r in English "straight" and "burn".
These long sounds are not sorted separately in alphabetic lists.

Carons: 
č is prounounced as ch in English "child".
ď is a little similar to UK pronunciation of d in "dew". (Uppercase form is Ď)
ľ is pronounced similar to gl in Italian "Cagliari". (Uppercase form is Ľ)
ň is pronounced as gn in Italian "lasagne", simlar to ny in English "canyon"
š is pronounced as sh in "English"
E. g. Slovak ice-hockey player Miroslav Satan (NY Islanders) is actually Miroslav Šatan, no association with Lucifer.
ť is a little similar to UK pronunciation of t in "tune" ((Uppercase form is Ť)
ž is pronounced as J in French name "Jean" or s in English "pleasure".
These are sorted separately in alphabetic lists. Č after C, Ď after D etc.

Then there is dz and dž:
dz is pronounced similar to ds in English "odds"
dž is pronounced as dg in English "edge" or j in "jam"
Typography-wise, it is not a ligature but simply d followed by z (or ž).
Dz and Dž should be sorted separately. But sometimes they are in the end of D-section of alphabetic lists.
Written as DZ and DŽ when all caps is used.

Ch: written as Ch if it is the first letter of names , sentence etc. Written as CH when all caps is used.
Pronounced as J in Spanish name "Juan" or Kh in Russian surname Khrushev or ch in Scottish pronunciation of "Loch Ness"
Ch is placed after H in alphabetic lists.

Then we have ô:
it is "uo" pronounced simultaneously, little similar to uo in English "quote".

ä - pronounced as a in English "mad". Something between a and e, but majority of native speakers now pronounce it as simple e, like in English "bet".

y is pronounced as i - no difference, only in written language.
j is pronounced as y in English "yes"
w is pronounced as v - no difference, only in written language (w is used in the words of foreign origin only)

What is much more important, Slovakia has the greatest concentration of pretty women in the world. Especially Englishmen and Germans are very often embarrassed because of this in the streets of our towns.

BTW, Slovak model Adriana Karembeu-Sklenarikova has Czech surname: it is actually Sklenaříková with Czech ř character, pronounced as r and z simultaneously.

		<div class="commentbody"><cite> And unlike in Spanish where Ll, Ñ, and Rr are considered separate letters (though Rr is sometimes an exception; it also never occurs initially, and thus has no separate dictionay entry)</cite>

Close, but most native speakers get it confused too.  In Spanish the alphabet is (letters not in the English alphabet emboldened)

A B C <strong>Ch</strong> D E F G H I J K L <strong>Ll</strong> M N <strong>Ñ</strong> O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Part of the reason that the double r is not seen a separate letter is that, in reality, it simply represents a normal r, twice.  Two flaps are for all intents and purposes, a trill.  A single r is an alveolar flap in most dialects, and a double r is a alveolar trill.  In the dialect of Portuguese I learnt, the r is either a flap or aspiration, and the double r is another sound entirely, roughly a voiceless uvular fricative though not quite exactly the same as the Spanish j.

Dictionaries are no longer sorted according to the alphabet, as in 1992 the RAE decided to not use the Spanish alphabet for collating purposes, although children are still taught the above alphabet. Additionally, each vowel can have an acute accent placed over it, though they aren't considered separate letters.  As well the U can take a diæresis.

I don’t doubt that your information is more correct than mine (you’re the native speaker, after all), but I have often heard Spanish people spelling words like <em>pero</em> and <em>perro</em> as, respectively, “Pe E Ere O” and “Pe E Erre O”, which led me to believe that Rr is (at least in the mind of the common man) a separate letter. I’ve never heard a Portugese person spell out similar words like “Pê Ê Erre Ô”.

(Theoretically, I suppose he’d be more inclined to spell it out as “Cê A com tilde O”, anyways, but that’s a different matter.)

Not sure exactly how I managed to leave Ch out of the list before, though …

&nbsp;

<cite>«Dictionaries are no longer sorted according to the alphabet»</cite>

What, then, length? ;-)

For some reason, I had never before realised that of the Spanish dictionaries I have (not that many, mind, only four), it’s only some of them that are sorted according to the alphabet you laid out above, and the way I’ve always learned it. My 2001 <em>Pequeño Larousse</em>, for example, lists Ll under L and so on. How did I miss this for so many years and still manage to use these dictionaries?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not a native speaker, though I study Spanish academically (native English but after living in Spain now my English has noticeably gotten worse mostly in syntax)

As I mentioned, many people mistakenly think that since LL is a letter, that RR is as well, even making its way into games like Scrabble, so as you mention, in the minds of the average person it is often thought of as a letter.  I generally say "erre doble" when it pops up like I do with t when I inevitably have to spell out my obviously foreign name over here (eme a te doble hache e uve doble); otherwise they think I'm just repeating myself for emphasis, rather than because it actually is a doubled letter. Even for the CH, I generally spell Stuckwisch as ese te u ce ca uve doble i ese ce hache, to make sure they heard me correctly and because it's not of Spanish origin and thus it actually IS a c and an h. (it is possible to have a double R that is not a digraph, such as in the word superresponsable, which <em>technically</em> should be supe<strong>rrr</strong>esponsable) because it's a flap followed by a separate and in theory distinct trill, but unlike the recent German reform, the Spanish realise that three letters like that in a row looks kind of silly).

In the entry for «abecedario» in the Diccionario panhispánico de dudas (published by the RAE) it mentions the following (I'm posting the translation for others, but the original is at rae.es in the DPHD 

<strong>alphabet</strong>. 1. To designate the ordered series of letters with which ones represents the sounds of a language, the terms abecedary and alphabet are used indistinctively.  Like the rest of the romance languages, Spanish basically uses the Latin alphabetic series, which was adapted and completed over the course of the centuries.  The Spanish alphabet is today formed by the twenty-nine following letters: <em>a, b, c, ch, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z</em>.
2. This Spanish variant of the universal Latin alphabet has been used by the Academy since 1803 (forth edition of the academic <em>Dictionary</em>) in the production of all its alphabetized lists.  From this date, the digraphs <em>ch</em> and <em>ll</em> (graphic symbols composed of two letters) were conventionally considered letters of the alphabet, being that each of them represented a single sound.  Nonetheless, in the 10th Congress of the Spanish Language Academies Association in 1994, it was agreed to adopt the universal latin alphabetic order, in which the <em>ch</em> and <em>ll</em> were not considered independent letters.  Consequently, words which begin with these two letters, or that contain them, are alphabetized in the corresponding spaces under <em>c</em> and <em>l</em>, respectively.  This reform only affects the alphabetic ordering process of words, not the composition of the alphabet, of which the digraphs <em>ch</em> and <em>ll</em> still form a part.
3. While the digraphs <em>ch</em> and <em>ll</em> are the only glyphs that represent, respectively, the sounds /ch/ and /ll/, the sound that represents the digraph <em>rr</em> is the same a that represented by the <em>r</em> in the initial position of a word, or preceded by the consonants <em>n</em>, <em>l</em>, or <em>s</em>.  This overlap explains why <em>rr</em> has never been considered one of the letters of the alphabet. [<em>My addendum: not to mention that there is a minute difference between intervocalic r and the other r-based sounds especially compared to the large distinction that the second l or the addition of the h makes</em>]

You probably missed it because most of us when we don't think about it will instinctively look up a word like "llave" in the L section.  If we don't find it and say to ourselves "¿qué coño es este?" it dawns on us that we need to check the LL section.  Of course if it IS in the L section it doesn't cross our minds.

Do words with initial [r] (represented by the letter r alone) not remain unchanged when used in compound codas if the compound onset ends in a consonant? If one were to join, for example, the prefix <em>sub-</em> with <em>responsable</em>, the resulting word would still be only <em>subresponsable</em>, not <em>subrresponsable</em>, despite the combination &#x2011;br&#x2011; being usually [βɾ] rather than [βr]—wouldn’t it?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello,

I'm a Native Portuguese, and as we do learn the alphabet here is not 25 but 26 letters, with the w included although we, not that long ago did just care to learn 23 letters, as in ABCDEFGHIJLMNOPQRSTUVXZ, we didn't use the remaining 3.

This happened because we have a grammar that's based only on those 23 letters (plus the accents ´`^~, we dont use the ¨ like brazillian portuguese does; the "nh" – equivalent for the spoken "ñ" in spanish – and "lh" – sort of like the spanish "ll", but rather unique – digraphs). 
But with these foreign language words appropriations into our own language and neologisms, the portuguese grammar evolved, so we now include all the basic roman alphabet.

ohungarumlaut (0151)   
Ohungarumlaut (0150)
uhungarumlaut (0171)
Uhungarumlaut (0170)


Eight digraphs: Cs, Dz, Gy, Ly, Ny, Sz, Ty, Zs

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>Do words with initial [r] (represented by the letter r alone) not remain unchanged when used in compound codas if the compound onset ends in a consonant? If one were to join, for example, the prefix sub- with responsable, the resulting word would still be only subresponsable, not subrresponsable, despite the combination ‑br‑ being usually [βɾ] rather than [βr]—wouldn’t it</cite>
Like you said, it does depend on what the final letter of the prefix is, and while it can change slightly depending on dialect, traditionally it is N, L, and S in front of an R.  A word like "cederrom" has the double R (just being a pronounced out version of "CDROM").  Of course I'm rather lacking in examples at the moment otherwise (I need my morning coffee).  It doesn't come up much but every once in a while. 

<cite>Yo creía qué eras español. (I thought you were from Spain).</cite>
Pues de momento vivo en la periferia de Madrid, pero soy alabameño.  I did my BA in New Media and Spanish, but my masters I'm working on is just in Spanish literature and I took a year off to come work in Spain <em>in theory</em> to finish up my thesis while relaxing a bit outside of university life.  There's been a bit more of relaxing than writing though...

<cite>Ch and Ll are no longer considered letter by themselves. Ch is ’filed’ under C, and Ll under L.</cite>
They are still considered letters, just not for collation (filing) purposes:

“This reform only affects the alphabetic ordering process of words, not the composition of the alphabet, of which the digraphs ch and ll still form a part.” (orig: Esta reforma afecta únicamente al proceso de ordenación alfabética de las palabras, no a la composición del abecedario, del que los dígrafos ch y ll siguen formando parte.)
 
The Spanish alphabet is today formed by the twenty-nine following letters: a, b, c, ch, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. (orig: El abecedario español está hoy formado por las veintinueve letras siguientes: a, b, c, ch, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z )

Both quotes are from the on-line copy of the first edition (2005) of the Diccionario panhispánico de dudas published by the Real Academia Española in collaboration with the other twenty-one national Academias de la Lengua Española in Latin American and elsewhere.

		<div class="commentbody">In Typical's transliterated Devanagari alphabet, note that the distinction of capitalization doesn't actually exist in Devanagari, so the capitals are only used to follow certain romanized conventions. 

And, as I'm sure is probably true of some other alphabets, there are certain Devanagari letters which will never appear at the beginning of a word, and so the capital transliterated form is truly only theoretical. At least not in Sanskrit; there might be some Hindi or Pali conventions that I'm not aware of.

Also, Typical has, in his bottom summary, listed both m-underdot and m-overdot (sorry, I don't know how to enter the glyphs here) -- but I believe that those are both just alternatives for transliterating anusvara and are not two different members of the alphabet (and may be exclusive of one another, depending upon the transliteration scheme).

The softener mark, typographically identical to a free-standing acute accent (which makes it ugly as hell—what’s wrong with using a simple apostrophe or even an &#x02BB;okina as in Hawai&#x02BB;ian?) and indicates that the syllable in which it’s found is suprasegmentally palatalised, meaning that vowels are slightly fronted and consonants are slightly palatalised.</div>

Skolt saami is apparently spoken in parts of Norway, Finland and Russia - but not in Sweden :-D

acnapyx: Russian added. Thanks!

vinceconnare: already had english in, but without the diacritical letters needed for loanwords. I'm pretty sure the kids in english-speaking countries learn that the english alphabet has 26 letters - A to Z ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Roger S. Nelsson: Er... Do the Philippine alphabet use the spanish alphabet including the ch and ll - or excluding them? ;-)

(Very late reply. Apologies. :|) 

Let me make a correction. I meant English, not Spanish. I just realized that there are a lot more other characters in the Spanish alphabet that we don't use. This means we use A-Z, plus Ñ and Ng. :)

However there are a huge number of local dialects spoken in the Philippines, and each has a different alphabet. :)</div>
