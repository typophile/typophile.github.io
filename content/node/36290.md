  have given to me on this website. I am a photographer / slash / designer, and i
  am currently working on a project where i will be needing a Greek font for. I have
  searched on all the huge fontshops to buy a greek font that looks like it could
  be used for Tattoo lettering, but i can't really find anything but the standard
  fonts... :/\r\nI really hope that someone can redirect me to some typefaces that
  support Greek language as well.\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\njolijn\r\n"

  body: "hey ludwig thanks for the reply...\r\nwell its not for my own tattoo, its
    for a game where we need lettering that looks like it's been tattooed. people
    fill in a name and it will then turn into a tattoo font drawn on a picture...
    (its silly i know, but i really need it). i've been looking for these fonts for
    a week now haha. and i seriously haven't found one site that offers many choices
    in Greek (if you are looking for greek fonts that are not minion, times, etc...
    ), i did however found the Script fonts that i was looking for on www.parachute.org\r\n....
    but this tattoo font is really problematic! \r\n\r\n:("

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=78258\">Here</a> is
    the kind of alphabet I meant.\r\n\r\nI suppose the feature won't be for Greek
    users only? And that perhaps you're looking for a tattoo-like font that supports
    all kinds of alphabets, including accented Latin, Cyrillic and Greek? That won't
    be easy indeed\u2026 But if you only need Greek chars, probably you could write
    them down, trace them and add them into the font. In this case perfectly even
    spacing and kerning isn't needed, I guess, and neither are well shaped outlines.
    Some distortion might fit a tattoo font anyway.\r\n\r\nDid you go through <a href=\"http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/greek.html\">Luc
    Devroye's exhaustive index page</a>?"
