body: "Until Christmas 2007 I had been working for a few years at a design shop run
  by friends. We were winding up one big design project that had taken most of our
  efforts for months, and we'd been all but promised another big project to begin
  after the holidays. It didn't materialize, and I was laid off.\r\n\r\nI'm shopping
  my portfolio around and talking to all kinds of folks, but the current economy seems
  to be making people skittish about the financial commitment involved in hiring someone
  on a regular basis. So it looks like back to freelancing for me. I'll do any kind
  of design and layout work over the web, but ideally I want steady part-time work
  here in Montreal so I can get on with other projects.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that
  so do a lot of other people.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.khatvanga.com/portfolio/\">Online

    your online portfolio; right now it looks like a very dated home page. Organization
    it into subsections with small images that link to the hi-res stuff would be a
    much better way to present your work. If you can manage the server side using
    <a href=\"http://indexhibit.org/\">indexexhibit</a> might be a good way to go."

  body: It isn't supposed to be a "site" in itself, just a repository of links to
    various things. But I take your point &ndash; it would make a better impression
    if it were spiffed up. Going to work on that over the next few days. Thanks for
    your encouragement.
