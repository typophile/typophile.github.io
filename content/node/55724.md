body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/014_AA1208_6604.jpg]\r\n\r\nIm trying to
  track down the original creator of Sabon BQ and Sabon Expert BQ. I inherited it
  on a magazine, and the question of licensing has come up and I am unable to find
  the producer/designer/foundry.\r\n\r\nIve attached a jpeg. Its very tightly tracked
  however.\r\n\r\nDo you think it may just be mis named?\r\n\r\nThere are very few
  references to it on the internet, one is a free type site: I found this in the txt
  file with font file, but the font is only one style, roman, and it is True Type.
  Im trying to get a liscense for and open typeversions, of whole face family.\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.fonts101.com/xt_search.asp?txtSearch=sabon+BQ&Submit=Search&vt=Search\r\n\r\nAny
  help greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    most influential foundries of the 20th century. Sabon was originally designed
    by Jan Tschichold. His work echoes far in our times and the future, too. "
