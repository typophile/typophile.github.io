    with its ability to print finely detailed lettering was a real challenge to the
    makers of typefaces. As type-making techniques improved type-makers were increasingly
    able to approach the detail of lithography and win back some the advertisers who
    had abandoned type in favor of lithographed ads.\r\nI suggest that the adoption
    by type foundries of the technique of shading part of the letter to mimic the
    work of an engraver on metal or an incised letter in stone was part of this effort.\r\nWhat
    would be interesting would be to identify the first use of this technique. I don't
    know off hand if this was a late 19th century innovation, or whether it dates
    back to the 18th century or earlier. Any info from our type historians?\r\nDon"

    of the engraved letters are encapsulated by an exaggerated transitional type by
    Benton, an incised copper type by Goudy and a wide and square gothic by the Inland
    Type Foundry.\r\nThe first use of these letters is sign display for shops and
    artisans. But it changes throughout the XX th century. "

    \u2018Feuille de lettres d\u2019affiches\u2019 are from 1837:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/36088795@N03/5801922724/\r\nDepending
    on which kind of letters you define as \u2018engraved\u2019 (outline, outline
    filled with patterns of parallel lines, outlines filled with ornamental structures
    or elements) there are many more examples of letterpress typefaces that are older
    than that. Some of them are older than Senefelders first lithographic prints (1797).
    The book \u2018Type \u2013 A visual history of Typefaces and Graphic Styles, Volume
    1, 1628 \u2013 1900 by de Jong, Purvis and Tolenaar, Taschen 2009 could be good
    and well documented starting point for an investigation on where to find such
    examples. The idea of filling an outline with an engraved pattern is not bound
    to letterpress or lithography though. You\u2019ll find some engraved letters in
    George Bickham\u2019s Universal Penman from 1843 too, and that\u2019s copperplate
    engraved writing and lettering."

    the initials as can be found in letterpress printed printed books from the 16th
    century:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/bookhistorian/\r\nThis book here seems
    to have been printed in Milano in 1514. It shows initials with patterns of parallel
    engraved lines:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/bookhistorian/sets/72157634023958756/with/8995866410/\r\nIt
    seems that these initials were usually cut in wood, but one would have to take
    a closer look to find out what it is that we are looking at in this case.\r\nBut
    I think, that these initials started their life as letterpress-equivalents to
    the illuminated initials of the written books from before that time:\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/e-codices/\r\nSeveral
    book and printing historians claim that the first printed books were sold with
    blank spaces on the positions where one would expect illuminated initials. This
    would at least explain that some libraries have books with those blank spaces
    in their collections. The idea was that the buyer would have the initials added
    by an artist of his choice, just as the buyer would go to a bookbinder to have
    the book bound according to his demands. After the printers found out that many
    of their customers did not have their books illuminated anymore, they came up
    with letterpress initials."

  body: "I think I see what you mean now. Many foundries rather tried to keep up with
    trends in lettering and in engraving than initiating these themselves. I do not
    think that we can generalize this though. Especially when it comes to the point
    where one wants to find out who initiated a particular style, it will be difficult
    to trace back wether the hen or the egg was around first. I would not know what
    sources the Inland Foundry used to create their typeface Blair in 1900.\r\nhttp://dailytypespecimen.com/image/33012533820
    \ but I am sure there are several other foundries which had such a typeface way
    before that time. The same is probably true for Monotype Engravers. Business Cards
    and letterheads were not the typical jobs one would use a complicated and expensive
    machine like that of Monotype or Linotype for. Especially in their early years
    both companies were busy with adapting text typefaces for their machines. Foundry
    type was their main source of inspiration. They did some typefaces for headlines
    as well, but theses were intended for use on title pages of books and smaller
    head- und sublimes in newspapers or as headings in classified ads."

    into the ink, which swells and sets once heat is applied, after the job has been
    printed.\r\nSo, by using a \u201Ccopperplate\u201D style, one may inexpensively
    imitate proper engraving, with either letterpress or offset lithography.\r\n\r\nI
    know nothing of the history of this process, having become familiar with it in
    the 1970s.\r\nI found that Souvenir looked quite good with thermography, but I
    didn\u2019t attempt to imitate the classic engraving look.\r\n\r\nThe \u201Cminting\u201D
    of Copperplate Gothic may well have been intended to counteract the loss of sharpness
    that occurred in non-engraving typography.\r\n\r\n "

    image!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Copperplate Script, I have seen many uses of it
    on letterheads. Maybe it was less used on business cards. Perhaps too female for
    businessmen? I recall having seen it on the small letterpress printed cards that
    parents used to send in celebration of the birth of a child though (What\u2019s
    the proper english term for that?). I\u2019ll look for these in the family albums
    next time I visit my parents. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Copperplate Script, we
    have to remind that it is what it says: A script engraved in copperplate. The
    copperplate engravers reproduced (their own) handwriting. But not only the italics
    one may write with the pointed flexible nib. In Bickhams Universal Penman you\u2019ll
    also find fine examples of the English Court Hand, Blackletter as well as lower
    case letters matching the capitals of \u2018Engravers Roman\u2019. Which is way
    before Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni reproduced that kind of letters as printing
    types.\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Bickham-ABC.png\r\n\r\nTake
    a close look at the last four letters in the sentence \u2018Engrav\u2019d by George
    Bickham Senr.\u2019 and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Note that Bickham is a rather
    late example. "

    French calligraphers of his time. Take a close look at his roman lower case letters.
    This was done 80 years before Bickham.\r\nhttp://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47da-e952-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\r\n\r\nThe
    second reason is the \u2018thermoprint effect\u2019. Jarry\u2019s calligraphy
    probably does not show that much relief as with thermoprint or letterpress. But
    his guilded letters surely did \u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/bailly-jacques-and-jarry-nicolas-5662584-details.aspx\r\n\r\nNote
    the resemblance of Nicolas Jarry\u2019s calligraphy with the Roman du Roi and
