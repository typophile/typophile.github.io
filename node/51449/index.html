  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">For those who are unaware, Igino Marini has developed what he calls "Ikern," a program/service/concept that generates kerning for type. According to most everything I've read about it, the entity that is "Ikern" works quite well. But it raises questions for me.

First (and should he visit this site perhaps he could provide a response), Mr. Marini has been particularly vague when it comes to, well, pretty much everything other than generic explanations of the hows and whys of IKern, choosing instead to focus more on the positive reviews given by designers for whom IKern has been successful. 

Since these are designers I would tend to believe, I can only assume Mr. Marini has developed what to some could be an extremely valuable program/service/concept. The only problem is, as of today IKern is still very much the man behind the curtain. And as far as I can tell, the only real way to find out anything about it is to contact Mr. Marini directly via email.

Am I the only person who feels uncomfortable about this? All I really want to know are the essentials: is this or will this become "software," available for purchase at some point? If it's a "service" only, what are the costs? What is the turnaround time? How in general terms does the program/service work?

I also am one who believes Mr. Marini has created something that stands a chance of becoming quite successful in a variety of ways, but for my own personal reasons I simply don't feel comfortable going on fishing expeditions, regardless of how friendly the fish might be. Not just in this case, but at all. Therefore, does anyone have the kind of basic information on IKern I've asked above?

Additionally, if IKern was able to produce quality results - and I have no reason to doubt it does - would it be something you'd use? Would you buy it if it was released as software? I just find the whole thing intriguing but strangely mysterious.</div>

I've contacted him about iKern, and he answered all my questions promptly via email. 

Because he has created something proprietary, and because it's probably something that others might want to duplicate, I can respect his decision not to reveal all the machinations behind the curtain.

I'd be wary of paying for this service now only to have his creation released as software and available for purchase at a rate less than the cost of the service.

It seems respectful to keep that type of specific information out of this thread, unless it's provided by Inigo.

His site reveals quite a bit.

		<div class="commentbody">Re <em>program/service/concept</em>
and <em>does he himself or relies on software to complete</em>:
For the designer, it is service, not a program to be had. This is said on the website. Google a bit ("ikern site:typophile.com"). Igino Marini has contributed to two or three Typophile discussions and answered this and other questions already.

Re <em>generic explanations of the hows and whys</em>:
As far as can I see, iKern is based on abstract ideas about spacing. A description of this tends to be "abstract" too. Yet the <a href="http://ikern.com/k1/?page_id=9" target="_blank">description</a> is not abstract-as-business-talk but abstract-as-technical. (Designers hate abstraction, I know.) Perhaps it helps to know that English is not Igino Marini's first language -- nor is it mine -- and I know very well how hard it can be to explain conceptions that are far from trivial.

Re <em>positive reviews given by designers</em>
or, which seems to be your question, quality of results:
Different designers have different ideas about what good spacing is. Speaking for myself only, I can say that I was surprised how good iKern's results are. (To put it this way: After trying test words on the MyFonts site I think that iKern may help you improve the spacing of Morning Sans.)

Other issues have been dealt with by beejay and others already.

If you feel more comfortable with an application that you can install on your own computer, there also is <a href="http://fonttools.org/" target="_blank">KernMaster</a>. Whether service or application or manual work, or a combination of two or all three, really depends on you, your expectations, or how much you want to control everything. The latter causes me to do everything by myself but I am aware that this is irrational and not always backed up by facts, and am trying to get rid of this attitude.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is sad to see so many of my fellow young designers come here looking for ways to automate or sub out fitting and kerning. These are just as essential to typeface design as drawing outlines. The way to properly space a font is to do it yourself. The way to learn how to properly space a font is to keep designing and spacing new fonts. Your first fonts are not going to be fit well. But whose first fonts have good outlines or lettershapes either? You will get better. Do not invest money trying to find short-cuts. Work hard. For a long time.

		<div class="commentbody">Drawing the outlines the first time is not the last time. The interaction of spacing and kerning causes us (well, at least me) to revisit the outlines to delve into fitting and redrawing. In the process, I can see problems in the drawing. I don't know how to pluck one part of the process out and make sense of the rest. Perhaps, like Karsten, I want to control it all. I am still learning what makes the whole thing tick. I may never have the whole answer but I have always needed to know how things worked.

		<div class="commentbody">That's a good point, Chris. I can't design a typeface without taking its spacing into account, and often adjust the shape of letters to address spacing problems. 

I don't imagine Ikern, or anything similar, would be much help at all with a connecting script, for example. The only way to fix the spacing in a connecting script is to change the shapes of the letters. 

Maybe it's possible to draw all the letters first, then space the letters, the end. To me, it's a loop, not a one-way street.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Like Chris and Mark, I have found that modifying letters in the process of kerning is something I feel a need to do. This has been particularly true with the swash letters that are part of the font I am finishing. IKern sounds very good, but I think having a application such as FontMaster, that I can deal with interactively, altering letters if I want, is something I would be more comfortable with in the future. (This first time I felt I had to do it all to develop my eye; in future I would judge a computer-generated result better.)

Because I suspect a lot of designers feel like Karsten, Chris and Mark, I have a feeling that IKern might prosper better as an application rather than a service. But of course I don't know.

		<div class="commentbody">I love all the interesting comments here. Among them:

"For the designer, it is service, not a program to be had. This is said on the website."

I realize it's a service in regards to interaction between Mr. Marini and a designer. My question was more along the lines of, does he go into a font and kern it after applying some script/formula/whatever, or has he created actual software for it? I'm thinking in terms of compatibility here.

"After trying test words on the MyFonts site I think that iKern may help you improve the spacing of Morning Sans."

No kidding ... I totally suck at kerning and spacing. But not for lack of lengthy, frustrating effort. What especially drives me nuts is the difference in the appearance of kerning just between two different applications. If I test the kerning in Quark, it's almost guaranteed to look different how it appears in Microsoft Works. And that's just kerning. Even checking the spacing in Notepad vs. Wordpad is mind-boggling. All of which of course fails to even mention how it all looks in print. In many ways it's like a house of cards. As an aside, I think you'll see an ongoing correlation between my confidence and knowledge in kerning with the cost of each released typeface.

"I can’t design a typeface without taking its spacing into account, and often adjust the shape of letters to address spacing problems."

I'd love to hear some examples of this. I would assume this also means you often adjust the spacing to address problems with the shapes of letters, correct? Just curious, because relying on one without the other, in my mind, makes one more important than the other.

"Do not invest money trying to find short-cuts. Work hard. For a long time. It will be worth it in the long run."

I work very hard and am definitely improving at it, if not due to sheer repetition. However I'm not sure I'd call effective automated kerning a "short-cut." I wouldn't call it the end all, be all either. At this point I'm still trying to feel my way around because I see so many different avenues both taken and available. For example, I've seen highly talented designers turn over an entire typeface to be kerned by another individual, who then does it manually and not by applying automation. Is that considered a short-cut? If I had a partner who was a kerning whiz but didn't like drawing letters, would teaming with him/her be a short-cut? There are all kinds of considerations and approaches; and while I continue to grind away at learning the concept as you suggest, ultimately my goal is discovering what works the very BEST, all things taken into account.

An example of adjusting the shape of a letter might be changing the position or size of the ear or the bottom loop on a two-story lowercase "g". When it stands alone, it might look great, but it might not fit well next to other letters, and cause gaps or crowding.

Kerning is meant to address problems with spacing letters with irregular profiles. Some letter shapes have unavoidably irregular profiles (T, L, Y, A, etc.). Sometimes these shapes can be altered to lessen the need for kerning.

I don't see how anyone can design a typeface by only considering the shapes of the letters in isolation. Characters in typefaces don't exist to be seen in isolation, they are meant to look good next to each other. Spacing is not more important than character design, or the other way around. They should ideally be considered simultaneously.</div>

I don’t see how using an automatic kerning tool implies drawing the letters in isolation. There’s no reason to assume that no preliminary spacing is being done by people working this way. I see no suggestion on the part of Igino or curious designers that automated process are not being performed in a vacuum and that if a pair doesn’t work when the spacing is generated, that the flaw goes unfixed. Just like when using a computer to interpolate weights, autospacing is still going to need watching. But it does allow for designers who can’t be font designers full-time to finish typefaces in much less time, and perhaps do a better job than they would if they can only fit in time between work/kids/etc.. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, so that was a bit of a straw man.

When I started making digital fonts, I would draw the characters in Illustrator and then import them into Fontographer to do the spacing. I didn't realize until I started using FontLab and had to abandon working in Illustrator (because Illustrator import was seriously deficient back then--it's better now), that I was making a lot of work for myself by separating the drawing from the spacing. When I draw a font now, I keep the metrics window open and space the font at the same time I'm drawing it. When I'm done with the drawing, I've also done most of the spacing. The only spacing step left is the kerning. The only reason the kerning is done separately is because it has to be done systematically. If you do it as you go along, it's easy to overlook combinations. Plus, you can't know what the problem combinations are until you get the normal spacing and drawing finalized. 

To me, it's all one organic process. When I'm finished, everything is just the way I intended. I love finding ways to save time and effort, and I use every short cut I can, but not on the design part. I see spacing primarily as a design activity, not a routine task I can leave to an algorithm.

I'm not saying there's no value to Ikern or other auto-spacing/auto-kerning services or applications. For some situations (maybe yours), it probably would save time and effort. I just can't imagine working that way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">“The 'iKern' enigma” is a very good title. I will surely use it on my site: it will be a new section for the people who think it'll be worth reading it! I really think there is an enigma: why Mr.Miller has spent more time on this thread than he would have spent writing me directly? For the other readers I could copy and paste at this point: on the very first page of my site I wrote: “I’d be glad to let you test iKern”. After everyone's own eye, testimonies are what more nearer to the direct experience I can conceive. I would like all the type designers I worked with would describe their experience. Some did and I thank them. Some don't want to go public this way. And I can't blame them: there's no lack of judges. And people ready to put in a bad light other people's work.
Has anybody experienced the whole iKern's process so to say that feedback between metrics and shapes is impossible or adversed? Karsten tested iKern and his opinion is important for me. Who said that using iKern means designing without sidebearings in mind? In my site I wrote: the designer remains responsible for “having primed” the metrics themselves. iKern is just a tool: it won't add originality, style, expertise or mastery. It will serve you with the best metrics possible whenever you want. For your utility and advantage only. Usually I send 1 or 2 intermediate versions. Lately I sent 9 final versions in a period of 2 weeks. It's not to push a button.

To Mr. Simonson: obviously when letters have to touch, design and spacing are the same thing and it's not the iKern's game, but... One year ago I've been challeged to space a font with letters some touching and some not. In that circumstance I added instructions to selectively force contacts and change sidebearings accordingly so to have no kerning. That development stopped there because it was just a trick really out of the core concept and less elegant than just setting manually. About adjusting shapes for letterfitting purposes. I have in mind the Fell Types: a good result can be achieved even with some of the most technically wrong typefaces ever. Are you sure that, if one would dare to “optimize” them, they would still shine? You also wrote: “I see spacing primarily as a design activity, not a routine task I can leave to an algorithm”. I wrote on my site explanations, and I will add more and more, trying to make understand that iKern is like a car, not an automatic pilot. It's alternative to the feet, not the brain.

To Mr. Reynolds:  You wrote: “The way to properly space a font is to do it yourself”. Do you think that the type designers fully satisfied of my work are less competent than you? How would you consider a type company willing to “invest money” in a “shortcut sad to look for” like iKern?

		<div class="commentbody">In brief, Dan, Mr Lozos and Mr Simonson say: Designing letterforms means at the same time designing the white space within and inbetween them, so designing and spacing go hand in hand.
Igino says: "Who said that using iKern means designing without sidebearings in mind?"

Let me split up the discussion into two, to make it more clear that there is no contradiction at all. Rather there are two issues discussed at the same time:

(1) <em>Designing type.</em>
An experienced designer does work as Dan, Mr Lozos and Mr Simonson describe, he designs with both black and white parts in mind. And of course he would space letters as part of the design process, to determine the overall rhythm, and be able to evaluate the word image and check individual letterforms' integrity.

(2) <em>Learning to design type.</em>
Before even considering to use any automatism, one should have learned -- the hard way -- what spacing and kerning is about. And this is what Dan wrote: "The way to learn how to properly space a font is to keep designing and spacing new fonts." There is no way around it. One doesn't <em>learn</em> by being served results nor by reading one or two books about type design.

As to (1), Igino acknowledges this.
As to (2), Igino's concern is not teaching type design but spacing letters.

Relying on automatism or service -- what about human assistants? -- still requires that a designer knows what he does and wants. He must look at the work and criticise. Of course one cannot criticize without having trained the eye before which, again, requires practice, not just being served results or reading books.

In so far, I do not see any controversy here. The point that is of more interest to me is another one: That in type design praxis one may not get around making use of some kind of automation, in the long run.</div>

I just posed a question. Which thoughts are you talking about? Maybe are you reading between the lines and putting thoughts into my brain? “The way to properly space a font is to do it yourself” is a statement that can't be read between the lines by anyone speaking a language. I haven't found another way, except the question, to incorportate a statement posed in a postulate form inside a discussion, that is, as far as I know, to share experiences and renounce for a while to the absence of doubts.

		<div class="commentbody">I think that iKern is an interesting service. Anyone has the right to use it. If they are happy with the results, I am happy that they are happy! 

However, I do not see a benefit in my workflow of incorporating something of that external nature into the process. 

If a type foundry asked for my recommendation (I work at a type foundry, although they have never asked for my opinion on this matter), I would not give a simple, one-word answer! On the other hand, I would express my skepticism. First of all, a large type foundry is unlikely to enjoy giving a typeface to space and/or kern to an individual using their own software. If in XX years, that foundry wanted to reproduce the workflow, and said designer/service were no longer in business, that would be bad. Second of all, many typefoundries are proud of their spacing and kerning habits, because they produce a sufficient level of quality across their product range.

Personally, as a typeface designer (and I am one, albeit a young one), I do not see the benefit in any method of spacing and kerning other than spending lots of time doing it yourself. This is my opinion, and is not meant as an attack on anyone else's. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I do not understand the foundry-related arguments.
(2) Since kerning is considered part of design and thus left to type designers, a foundry-as-publisher does not have spacing/kerning habits, nor is it of relevance to a foundry whether the type designer spaced/kerned manually or not. And since spacing/kerning is done by the designer, it is him who pays for kerning (currency being hours) not the foundry -- in this respect a foundry does not even need to have an opinion about kerning methods. All that counts is quality of the result.
(1) The result of iKern is sidebearings plus a kern feature. Manual spacing/kerning also results in sidebearings plus a kern feature. Both Igino Marini and a type designer may go out of business and worse, as human beings, are likely to pass away one day. I never heard that the latter is a problem for any foundry.

(2) Having a designer carefully space and kern is a spacing/kerning habit. When foundries release designs produced by external designers, they still stand behind the data, it is part of the brand they work with. While each font in a foundry may have been designed by separate designers, the fonts are still produced and released uniformly. A foundry may have an "art director", who looks over designer submissions and makes suggestions for improvement. It has long been the case that many designers do not submit one round of completed files, but several different, improving versions. When a foundry or a library releases a new typeface design, the fonts represent a process between the designer and the foundry. Even if the foundry does not do the spacing and the kerning (and they shouldn't), they still do care how their fonts are spaced and kerned, and how they appear in print, onscreen, etc.

(1) It is always important how products you distribute come into being. Companies with traditions or with "long tails" very often go back into their archives. Perhaps a custom client wants to have a version of a typeface, with just slight variations, or more weights/styles/etc. It is good to be able to go back into the native files, and be aware of how things were produced, as well as to be able to repeat these results (or at least closely repeat them). Sure, you could re-kern a font so that it had the same values as an iKerned font. But if a foundry used iKern for all its new releases, and it then canged the character set of a font five years later, it would ideally want to send the new font data back to re-iKerned before its re-release. With one man operations, this is difficult to guarantee.

I should state that of these two points, number two would be more important to me if I were a foundry/distributor/reseller/etc. than number one.</div>

(2) I am aware of the process you describe. And still the foundry is interested in the result -- quality standards to be met. The way in which a designer arrives at the result only becomes relevant if there is a need for improvement, then indeed one asks, and what is your approach, conceptually, that lead you to, uh, this?

(1) I do not see why, in your example, someone would want to entirely <em>re-kern</em> an expanded font to imitate previous kerning, if kerning already exists and only needs to be expanded. There simply is no difference between iKern output and manual output, in formal terms, both is a kern feature, i.e. kerning + class information. If you expand the glyph set, you'll end up doing some kerning additions, regardless of who/what the kerning in the first place.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">This is all terrific stuff; I especially enjoy and appreciate debates in which both sides have equally valid positions. To respond directly to a few things:

1.) Believe it or not, Mr. Marini, I am somewhat shy when it comes to one-on-one interaction of any kind. However, I can't say that's the entire reason I addressed the Ikern issue here. I'm not sure I know the main reason to be honest. If I had to guess though it would be this: Without knowing more of the fundamentals regarding your service, I'm afraid one of two things would likely happen. Either A.) I'd feel guilty for taking advantage of what seems to be a great service or B.) I'd get all excited about the whole thing and find out I couldn't afford it. 

It would be different if I knew IKern might be released as software, at which point even if I couldn't afford it at first I'd at least be able to rearrange my already minimal finances and "splurge." I guess my whole point, then, is with more up-front information, many of my questions could be answered without the need to disclose any proprietary information. I'd suspect there are many people who might consider this service but would be embarrassed should they realize it was not affordable for them; and those same people might not feel comfortable with accepting any "service" for nothing.

2.) I thought this comment was profound: "This first time I felt I had to do it all to develop my eye; in future I would judge a computer-generated result better." I believe this is important as well because no one is saying designers are frothing at the mouth to completely eliminate the kerning process via automation. I think most if not all simply feel like they have a better chance at success, kerning-wise, if they are provided a "launching pad" so to speak and then make adjustments from there. 

Besides, the bottom line is this: even for those who insist on doing things manually, I would think amidst a thousand kerning pairs there would have to be at least a few identical ones between your manual work and that of a program. And if that's the case, then how is it different to kern a typeface with X amount of space between characters (pre-kerned) and Y amount of space between  characters (after automated kerning is applied)? Even if the latter was off, certainly it would seem to have pointed a designer in the right direction. I can't imagine IKern creating a +44 kerning figure to a pair you'd actually kern at -50. However if IKern generated a value of -26, wouldn't you still be closer to the final manually generated value than if you'd started at zero? 

In the end it's all about analyzing - be it what IKern produces or what you do manually. I think if one were to fully understand the results IKern generates and adjust as needed - even if it requires adjusting every single potential pair - in the end you'll still have the kerning you want for your typeface. As for me, if obtaining the best kerning for a font required me to sing the national anthem and manually kern only the letter "G," I'd be at "OH say can you see," before anyone knew it.</div>

Nope. You did not just "pose a question". It wasn't an innocent question. You phrased it in a leading way, leading to your own conclusion about how Dan thinks by way of suggestion and implication.

Come again? Can yopu put it in plainer English please?

@Jos: <em>@ James: Please take into account that Igino very often has to defend his iKern. He’s a nice guy.</em>

Too much an assumption of bad faith on my part, and more reading between the lines coming from both Jos and Ignio here. I never implied Ignio is not a nice guy. I only questioned his rhetorical stance and what *appears to be* an attempt to put thoughts into Dan's brain. I even took the time to explain that I have no views on IKern. I *did say as much*. I'm not taking anyone's side in this discussion. All I'm doing  is defending one participant.

But a few of you are determined to see my intervention as some kind of attack.

The thing that would help most is to cease assuming bad faith. It gets none of us anywhere. I did not assume bad faith regarding Ignio's question for Dan. He asked a leading, loaded question, plain and simple. If Ignio can't see that or admit it, that's his problem, but it shouldn't be Dan's problem.

Do you people think you can handle that? Evidently you can't deal with it without abreacting, since the response has not been rational, and typically full of logic holes. I don't think I am asking or driving at a lot. It isn't exactly harsh criticism. I'm trying to reason with you guys, and it looks like at least one of you is determined to turn a polite discussion into a pissing match. I won't say who because personal remarks abot typophilers as people don't belong at typophile.

Ignio said: "Do you think that the type designers fully satisfied of my work are less competent than you?"

That's a leading, loaded question and quite suggestive. Hardly innocent. You literally asked if Dan thinks the type designers happy with his work are incompetent compared to himself (Dan).

Man, you people wouldn't last five minutes in my world (with the exception of Dan and Chris).

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not put off by any of Igino's comments about iKern. It is his product, and I am sure that he is proud of it. I am also sure that there are many customers who are happy with its results. I only lament the general discussion that there might be a way to simplify spacing and kerning in the typeface design process. In general, I have to say that I tend toward James Montabalno's comments in many of the previous thread about this topic. Thank you for trying to clarify things anyway, James.

What interests me most are typefaces. Not concepts or even processes, but typefaces… the end result. I like good typefaces. I think that most good typefaces are produced a certain way, and that there is certain evidence pointing to this, but hey! I could be wrong.

Bert, I wouldn't classify James or his responses as typically American. Although, I have to admit that I don't know what typically American is… and I'm not sure that there is anything typical about all Americans ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would like to say to everybody, and particularly to Dan, that I've never felt as being under attack. If there is an 'enigma' it is: why every time the word iKern appears on Typophile the same discussion raises? Since nobody questions the quality of its output, then is the context that have to be wrong. The metrics are in charge of the designer when he designs and also of the typographer when he set: these are the latest remarks. Every time cristicisms consist in traditional paradigmas applied to a process that's different and there's no way I could let envisage that difference. There is no discussion when someone says: I did so for years so this is the right way. It's just like writing posts in the critique section without having seen the fonts “discussed”. This is what I don't like. Anyway I'm the first to admit that my communication could be not enough. I've already begun to write new texts focused on these themes that, I'm sure, will make the picture clearer. Just wait. In the between I keep asking: test and judge yourself. If we were to find two parties in this thread they would be, in the end: those who didn't test iKern and those who did. Is this meaning something?

It seems to me that Dan essentially described Linotype that surely have one of the most, if not the most, wide and structured “production department”. On the other side there are one-man companies that probably don't sell licenses to institutions, banks or similar (for the moment). All the rest is in the between. I think that spacing and kerning are costs in any case. I can only say that to have, for example, an 800 glyphs font spaced and kerned in a few hours could make some difference somewhere. I'm not only referring to costs and timelines (that are money too). I'm referring to the fact that this possibility could shift the (market / dimensions structure) ratio and the (quality / dimensions structure) ratio to higher levels.

About iKern being a service: I don't think it will be a service the way it is today forever. iKern consists of two parts: an engine and a post processing module. The tuning of the engine really depends on the glyphs' shapes. The typographical choices are mainly done inside the post-processing module. I wouldn't be worried to give it away as a program so that designer could craft their own fonts by themself. Or maybe one day as a plugin for InDesign or Quark. Who knows? It will be the argument of one of my next texts.

From what you explain, the Font designer has a number of choices to make to 'tune' IKern, and also once the metrics are set hopefully the user of InDesign or Quark won't need to do much further kerning, if any. 

Karsten, if you've tested both IKern and FontMaster, how do you compare the results and ease of use? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">For the record, I think Mr. Marini is getting a bad rap here in some ways. It's almost like people believe Mr. Marini is developing the "Death Star" to use against the Rebel Typographic Forces on his way to conquering Earth. The truth is, whether anyone wants to believe it or not, he might be sitting on something quite lucrative before all is said and done.

However, to respond to this statement: "Imagine T. Edison talking widely about his light bulb, showing up the drawings, the pictures?"

If my history is correct (and good luck to me on that), Edison never made a dime on the light bulb, or anything else he invented, instead choosing to name it something like a necessity for humanity.

Also, I wasn't particularly concerned with the inner-workings of IKern, just the fundamentals. Sorta like, "This a light bulb and it creates light through electricity. Though in the test stages, we expect it to be released for general consumption by the public in X years/months, at an approximate cost of $X.XX." Or, "we plan to provide light bulbs to everyone who'd like to have one before the end of the year 1903, at a cost of $X.XX per month, or X.XX per usage hour." As it is now, all that's being said is, "We've got this thing, a light bulb, that will light your home like nothing before it. We'd be glad to test one in your home," without stating what comes after the test, whether or not it will be widely available or merely rented to those with the means to afford it, etc. 

I'm not necessarily complaining about the lack of information, I just live in America where people come out of the womb suspicious of the big guy with the blue mask and shiny tools in his hand. "Hey, whaddya planning to do with that thing??"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I already wrote an answer in the beginning of this thread, and while considering if I should post it (it was quite in the harsh tone of Mr. Arboghast), finally decided not to. After all, I did not want to dampen anyone's reputation (especially Igino's, whose name in fact was so often misspelled in this thread that it sounds really humiliating). 

But - just for the matter of discussion: you can in fact compare the results of iKern and KernMaster in quite simple way: take a typeface that is known to be kerned with iKern; save the kerning to AFM and strip the values to have a set of kern pairs to load into KernMaster. Then try to kern the same font. With same set of kern pairs I think you can judge which one is better.

I have to admit Fell Types are not the best examples to use, but the results with same list of kern pairs differ substantially. I have done this comparison quite long ago, and I haven't kept the results, but sometimes KernMaster offers negative values where iKern has calculated positive ones for the same pair. So, I trust the intentions of the developers of such algorythms, but no software is perfect. 

Personally I do not feel comfortable outsourcing kerning work, and although it is a tedious task, I often rewrite so much the KernMaster results that I ask myself why I attempted to automate the kerning in the first place. Of course I heavily suck in spacing and kerning, so I need a crutch to get the thing halfway, but I do not rely on such software that much, so I still do the spacing/kerning by hand - not least to improve my skills.

Personally I would prefer seeing iKern at least as a web-based service, served by scripts on a webserver, if Igino does not want to distribute it as a software. I would prefer to do the things myself, alter some settings and see the results in real-time. But after all, this is Igino's work, so the decision about how it should be used is left to him. If iKern was offered as a software, surely I would try to scrape my savings and 'splurge' (hope this happens someday). Until then, I'm not that much interested - just curious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Igino Marini deserves credit for attempting this effort. I have not tried it or even spoken to him but I would be curious to see how his service works. 
I don't think anyone here is trying to insult Igino, I just think we are a curious bunch and many of us have been bitten by anything that sounds like it is automatic or says it is time-saving. Anyone who has ever tried FontLab's auto-kerning can tell you it is a nightmare to fix the mess that it makes and you are better off staying away from it. I assume iKern must  be much better than that if Jos praises it.
We have to distinguish the difference between learning what good spacing and kerning is (along with becoming skilled in our craft) and having a time-saving tool that produces respectable work. The proof is in the pudding but most of us have yet to test it.

To Igino I will add that if anything I said was taken by him as derogatory or insulting, I am sorry and I assure you it was not intended. I wish you great success in your work.

		<div class="commentbody">A short story about how I got to know iKern ... For some years I was looking for a tool that could do a good auto-kerning job. I first came across iKern via Typophile, but because Igino's previous email address was heavely spammed I didn't get a reply. In March 2008 I read the"from Moleskine to market" article on iLT from Kris Sowerby where he mentioned he did his kerning with the help of Metrics Machine from Tal Lemings. I tried to contact Type Supply, but again didn't receive a response. Karstens site put me on the trail of DTL Kernmaster, which I thought I should keep i mind because it looked like a great option. When I was working on a new version of Anivers Igino contacted me via my blog and I recieved a reworked version of my earlier Anivers regular. I wasn't aware at that moment that iKern could also do auto-spacing. Igino was able to capture the spirit of Anivers with a spacing and kerning that made it sing. That really convinced me and we decided to collaborate on the iKerning of the complete Anivers family. In the process different versions were send to and from and always I felt I was in control of the workflow. You can [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/anivers/|*test*]] the free regular end result for yourself. After that Fertigo Pro and Museo Sans followed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At this point I think a clarification is needed. Every discussion on iKern as a marketing model, are out of place from the beginning because simply there is no a planned marketing model. iKern is not my job and is not my living. I see Jos has talked about how we first met on Anivers. He hasn't talked about his efforts to convince me to be paid because otherwise he would have felt like stealing. This is my marketing model! So if I had to spend six years developing a project to make some money being this project an autometrics tool then I wouldn't be that smart. If I wanted more money I would have worked more. Just simply. I spent a lot of time on iKern because I don't sleep too much! But, mainly, because it satisfied an inner exigence. I've conjugated an ideal of beauty, simplicity, essentiality, lightness and truth with logic, method and complexity. My arid talents. I've found my personal way to create something. It still makes me somewhat happy. This is the real reason. What's more I'm also an engineer. That's why I had to make something that works well. Having this thing in my hands it seemed natural to me to propose type designers to enjoy. I thank Chris for his wish of success. My success already is when the iKern's output is defined “fantastic”, “amazing” and so on by everyone used it. My success is when someone thanks me for having solved his problem. My real satisfaction is when Jos says: “Igino was able to capture the spirit of Anivers with a spacing and kerning that made it sing”. 
I have already said that today iKern is a service. I'm imagining how it will be tomorrow. Today I feel comfortable this way for many reasons not being the last that it's still a work in progress and that I wouldn't want to be in the position of having to defend my job because of others' errors. Not in this phase when I have still a lot to do defend my job itself! I still think the service it's a good way. On my site I've tried to explain, and I will do more, why it's not a conceptual error to conceive an intermediate figure between the type designer and the typographer. Type designers and typographers permitting! About the costs. I have to say it's not me who decided my basic fee. So I'm confident it's correct. I say basic fee because I keep the freedom to decide case by case. Let's say it's the equivalent of three hours of work: so everyone spending more than three hours spacing and kerning a font should be glad.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Igino and Jos, one question, does the type designer do much spacing themselves before handing the files over to iKern, or does the iKern service look after that?

and to those who have been against this initiative, how is it different to hiring a 'spaceing and kerning specialist'? I'm pretty sure i've heard it's not uncommon for some type designers to have their files optimised by others (usually from the foundry.

All this talk of spacing a kerning makes me wonder why Mrs Eaves has not been re-spaced for text settings, does anyone know why?</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I have no experience or opinion of iKern. But, as something of an aside, I'd like to point out that historically the type designer was not always the person who did the fitting.

Dwiggins left all of the spacing of his types to the Mergenthaler drawing office, under the supervision of C.H. Griffith. Dwiggins had a very specific and cultivated sense of what made for good spacing -- he knew it when he saw it and was frustrated when he didn't. He would make general suggestions on the overall spacing he felt was appropriate to any given design he was working on, commenting about key starting-point sidebearing values on his drawings. And he would give feedback on proof after proof. But he did not do the fitting himself, and generally deferred to Griffith's direction. 

As I tried to draw out in my talk at ATypI in Vancouver many years ago, Dwiggins may have had an excellent sense of good spacing, but he was completely wrong-headed about how to achieve it. There is a lengthy correspondence between the two men, through the years, about good spacing ("picket fence," Dwiggins would say). But WAD had some naive thoughts about how to accomplish it. In his defence, I am convinced that if he had had the opportunity to do the work himself, he would have pretty quickly realized the error of his ideas.

In at least one instance, when the fitting of the first Falcon design could not be achieved to the satisfaction of the two men, the conclusion was finally reached that there was something fundamentally flawed in the design. Dwiggins scrapped the first Falcon and started over completely, "root and branch."

My point is that while we today consider the shaping of letterforms and their spacing as an integral practice (and there's certainly a strong tradition of that as well), there is important precedence for a collaborative and even specialized approach to the process. What I understand of Jos and Igino's collaboration, with designer and engineer working in concert, sounds very similar to WAD and CHG's relationship.

		<div class="commentbody">I have not worked with Inigo, so can't really comment on iKern. I have used KernMaster, and while I ended up completely revising the results I will probably try it again on future projects: the results were not satisfactory, but they were heading in the right direction and helpfully indicated which pairs might need kerning (I used a large bore shotgun approach, with a giant list of potential pairs for KernMaster to chew over).

In response to Dan's comments, I do think it is absolutely critical for designers to understand how to space type correctly by eye, including kerning. But like many other designers I've talked with over the years -- and like David Kindersley before us --, I have the nagging sense that somehow it should be possible to automate the process, or at least much of the process. And the reason for this is that what I do when I am spacing type is systematic, and where there is a system there is the possibility of analysis and modelling. The problem I find with auto-spacing methods I have looked at to date is not that they don't work, in a general sense, but that they don't work the way I work, i.e. that they don't space type the way I space type and hence produce different results than I would produce.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Igino, I think the discussion keeps coming around to marketing because from the discussion here, and another I had off line, it seems that type designers strongly prefer an application to a service. It is under their control and in the long run cheaper to them. 

I understand your feeling reluctant to release it as an application if you are still not completely happy with it. But that is not the general way with software. Developers publish reasonably good but imperfect versions and then sell upgrades. Why not do that, providing type designers can deal with the interface reasonably easily? 

And as far as blame, nobody expects any font software to be perfect, and of course we grumble, but so what? The reality is that we're grateful for whatever help we can get, and many will pay for it.  

Oh, and from what I can tell on Igino's site, the principles behind IKern are something like the method John Hudson once described here, of having a shaped envelope around a glyph rather than side bearings. Not the same, but some kind of 'spaciness' assigned to each glyph. That seems like a good idea, and why I suspect that IKern may be better than the alternatives, though I don't know. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just a rough test with Constantia with default parameters. Above the font as is and below iKerned. Kerning can be made tighter or looser in the post-processing phase. Sidebearings remain the same unless fine tuned (not here). Fine tuning is done varying parameters not moving the sidebearings themselves. By the way I often used Constantia as a test font for serifs during development.

		<div class="commentbody">Excuse me, John. iKern doesn't have a GPOS reading function but reads only the plain 'kern' table. So before importing I had to convert existing kerning values having to filter them because the whole body wouldn't entered inside. I have lost those lowercase pairs. I'm sorry. Fortunately from an autospacing point an analysis is still possible because, as I already said, in iKern kerning can postprocessed (by the way chosing a tighter fitting for display size and a looser one, as is my example, for text setting) but spacing can't. I have corrected the previous image and this it is:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IKtestLow2_5606.jpg]
Being here I think it could be useful to show how this different tightening is. So I've prepared another picture showing two possible iKern outputs. Above is applied the "kerning strenght" level I usually use producing fonts without specific request. Below an higher "kerning strenght" level that I think is more adapt for display setting (even if this a difference that is more noticeable on uppercases).

		<div class="commentbody">There is some delightfully heady stuff in this thread. Along the lines of automated kerning vs. manual kerning, however, I do have a question to pose to the more "purist" of the designers here who strongly favor manual kerning:

How would the following differ from your process of manually kerning an entire text typeface, assuming the quality of the results would be the same and assuming the font is well-spaced:

1.) Run the typeface through any of the automated kerning programs, be it FontLab's, FontForge's, KernMaster, Lean Mean Fat Reducing Kerning Machine, whatever.

2.) Use the recently discovered (so I was late) wonderful script "automatic text," by checking each character against the rest and adjusting any runaway pairs.

3.) Generate and apply class kerning. 

Would this still be considered falling prey to the sin of automated kerning? Especially if time wasn't a factor? Even if this would potentially be adding an unnecessary step - some might say just skip step 1 and go right to step 2 - couldn't this process be considered "legitimate" if in the end it helped a designer produce better kerning than he or she might by taking strictly "manual" steps? Better yet, could the above process not somehow help designers become more familiar with the overall concept of kerning?</div>

The only auto kerning programs I have tried were FOG and FontLab. I don't know about the others. The two I tried sucked and took far longer to clean up than what little value they had. I would just analyze your glyphs and define classes and then start kerning the key glyphs. The auto thing does not teach you anything and it makes a mess to boot. 

If you are already comfortable with kerning and want to try one of the products or the service iKern, give it a shot. I would think you would need to have a firm knowledge of kerning before you can judge autokerning, though so I would not try it until you learn what it is.

		<div class="commentbody">One of the things I would like to see in an autokerning tool would be interactive reiterations (although I realise that the processing load would be very heavy). What I am thinking of is a tool within which one could first apply global autokerning, and in which one could then manually edit individual pairs <em>and have those edits intelligently reflected in the rest of the kerning data.</em> So, for example, if I decided that the kerning between av should be tighter, I could edit that pair to reduce the space between them; this would automatically tighten all the rest of the kerning by a relative amount; but then, if I were to say increase the space between another pair, e.g. vo, the kerning data would refresh again <em>but</em> would do so relative to both the edited av and vo pairs, i.e. a 'touched' pair becomes a fixed data point relative to which all the other kerning is floated. [Obviously one would also want options to 'release' edited pairs, to allow them to become floating again.] One can see, I think, how editing even a fairly small number of pairs will make the effect of each subsequent edit smaller, gradually solidifying the kerning, so that if the edited pairs are chosen carefully one can obtain desired overall kerning iteratively.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, your system would always have to rely on a model behind the “intelligent reflection” of the kerning data (aside from the basic autokerning to start with). You propose a different “input method” for this model: ‘from lower level (kerning values) to higher level (“intelligent reflection”)’ instead of ‘from higher level (properties) to lower level (kerning values)’ as I’m doing with iKern. Your method wouldn’t have an intrinsic safety if you choose kerning values in a non congruent manner but you probably would object that “you know” well the values to use. My system, instead, is tailored on me: I wouldn’t know well a priori the right values for the chosen key pairs. But I can recognize if they’re good or not when I see them.

Your approach would let you work essentially on an unique configuration you tend to since you begin to fix some of the elements. I personally prefer the iKern’s “input by changing parameters” method: I just have to control what happens if I change one element at a time so I always know what I’m doing. And I also like the possibility of looking (or let look) at different letterfitted configurations in real-time and then choose (or let choose) one of them. And, above all, I think is a faster and less tiring method that requires less focused choices to be made. But I can understand that you could prefer an approach more tied to your “forma mentis” and relying on your ability and experience.
