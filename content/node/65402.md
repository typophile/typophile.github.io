  started drawing a didone-like\r\nalphabet, taking Bodoni, Didot and a few similar
  font - and using my imagination and eye at least.\r\n\r\nFirst of all this is meant
  to be a self-training project - and I like well-crafted Didone-s too so try to achieve
  something like that :)\r\n\r\nIt is a very early stage - the very basic letterforms
  are still tweaked here and there, but I like its slightly condensed look. Small
  caps and text figures are added using some automated effects and hand-tweaking the
  results of these.\r\n\r\nI've tried to letterspace only the lowercase so far but
  the first result was a too tight look when text set and way too far wordspaces.
  First print test showed it too clearly.\r\n\r\nNow it would be great to get some
  professional feedback and any c&c regarding this project.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in
  advance!\r\n\r\nf.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Sorry for the not-so-good English."

    this fine will only work at a larger size than what appears in your specimen,
    I think. \r\nAccent shapes are too strange.\r\n/f/ needs more weight in the hood:
    \"affliction\" looks like \"attliction.\" /t/ needs more above the crossbar too.\r\n/g/
    looks very horizontal compared to the other letters.\r\nShould humps branching
    from stems (/m/, /n/, /r/ for example) come out of the stem lower? look also at
    joins at bottom of /a/, /b/, /d/, /u/, etc.\r\n/R/'s leg looks stunted (caps and
    small caps)\r\nI'd make /@/'s loop more symmetrical.\r\nThin in the middle of
    /W/ (caps and small caps) looks like it doesn't align as it intersects the thick.\r\n(I'd
    also make the specimen black on white.)"

  body: "Thanks, eliason, great comments!\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm considering to add some
    more weight to the hairlines to create a font to use for body text - and keep
    this one for display.\r\n\r\nAccents are really casual, just started looking for
    shapes - and only for a few of them, mainly the ones for Hungarian.\r\n\r\n'@'
    is not good at all, in my opinion - I will redraw it completely.\r\n\r\nSpecimen
    b/w was posted - thank you!"

  body: "Looks great. Just a few points:\r\n- the upper serif of the q looks like
    it is just a mirrored p. try to mirror it, like on d, l h etc.\r\n- the f needs
    also more crossbar, it looks too much like a long s (\u017F).\r\n- the upper end
    of the lowercase thorn feels rather uppercase: should be like l.\r\n- lower the
    bowl of the uppercase Thorn to have it more different from P.\r\n- The broad diagonals
    in VWXY appear a bit too broad compared with the vertical stems IMHO.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    and satisfied with it, karinskij - thanks! I will let you know when this happens."

  body: "I like your work!\r\n\r\nThere's a few places in the digits where some of
    the curves do not seem to flow together, particularly around the ball serifs.
    \ Two examples are the top left curve of the top of the 4, and the top right of
    the 3.\r\n\r\nAlso, there seems to be a spur on the top of the q, probably because
    of duplicated points.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nStephen\r\n"

    of the glyps mentioned above - and some other problems occured - would be glad
    to have some more c&c on this.\r\n\r\nText set in small caps is no letterspaced
    at all - just fora quick preview as I like the s caps.\r\n\r\nsgh, thanks for
    good comments - the next step is repairing figures - 8 is a hell."
