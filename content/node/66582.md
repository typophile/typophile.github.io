  the content was deleted. (As done on MetaFilter. In fact, there\u2019s a <a href=\"http://deletedthread.blogspot.com/\"
  title=\"Deleted Thread\">blog</a> of nothing but deleted MetaFilter [blue] threads.)
  If necessary, a customized 404 page could be displayed, but that wouldn\u2019t tell
  enough of the story.\r\n\r\nPresently, a deleted page leads you to <em>some other</em>
  page, usually a calendar of events. In essence, the site lies to you: You wanted
  one page, but we deleted that one without telling you and have decided to show you
  something you didn\u2019t want instead. It\u2019s misleading and anti-Web."
