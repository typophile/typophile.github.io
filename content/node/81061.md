body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI've searched everywhere for some good answers on why so many fonts
  are \"badly\" named. But found no good answers, so I hope the experts here can put
  some light on this issue :D\r\n\r\nWhen using a font manager a lot of fonts do not
  group into families. This has been very annoying for me over the years. Thanks through
  this forum I found some help on how to change the names so the fonts show up in
  a more convenient way. I used TTX and the book O\xB4Reilly - Fonts and Encodings
  as reference. It was tedious work, so I only changed some favorites. Yes DTL OTMaster
  would probably be a much faster way but it was to expensive.\r\n\r\nI found out
  that many fonts are named [Name] [Weight] and some are even named [Name] [Weight]
  [Style] in every name ID filed. That results in very long lists (almost no grouping)
  in any font manager and a lot of clicking when using the fonts in for example InDesign.
  Instead of using the drop down for the font you are using you also have to jump
  between different sets of the same family.\r\n\r\nI wonder why are so many fonts
  named in this way?\r\nTradition? \r\nA result of automated converting?\r\nWhy not
  just name them [Name] and then style, weight, etc under the designated \r\nID field?\r\nFor
  backward compatibility?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very annoying to me, non logic, cluttering,
  not following technical design standards and resulting in more work when using them.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The reason for including the style in the font name field is to ensure consistency
    of name, and correct appearance of the font, between different applications. Otherwise,
    there are too many different interpretations of the many font name fields.\r\n\r\nThis
    problem is fundamental to digital fonts, enshrined in Microsoft's original sin
    of defining a typeface family as four styles only.\r\n"

    live with it or do you have most fonts deactivated?"

  body: Contemporary fonts contain several different name sets that are compatible
    with different versions of various software. The Windows 4-style family is only
    one of those name sets, it just happens to have been around longer than most of
    the other name sets, but really there's no reason to think of it as the basic
    naming any more than any one of the other name sets, and I can imagine future
    font tools relegating this to a legacy, backwards-compatibility set. FontLab already
    goes part way to doing this by enabling one to view the Fonts panel contents by
    either 4-style or OT name set. Once the 4-style family ceases to be the default
    naming set in the Font Info panel too, it will be easier to think about names
    in fresh ways. Note that even Microsoft have moved on from the 4-style family
    in DWrite, although the 4-style family is obviously going to remain an important
    support issue for some time to come.

  body: "<em>Amazing that Microsoft has messed up even this.</em>\r\n\r\nSays who?
    Microsoft began--and remains primarily--an business-oriented operating system.
    As such, pigeonholing font choices to those most likely to be used in business
    applications--regular, italic, bold and bold italic--makes perfect sense, and
    needs not apologize. With the advent of Windows 2000/NT4--with native support
    for PostScript fonts--Windows encroached on the Macintosh's traditional territory
    (graphic design) so effectively that Apple rather quickly abandoned its dead-end
    \"classic\" OS. And, just recently, Apple abandoned its \"superior\" Motorola
    architecture, switching to Intel processors. An old Mac Addict bumper sticker
    slogan proclaimed, \"Intel inside, idiot outside.\" Oops. Hell, even Adobe finally
    gave up on its disinformation campaign against TrueType (developed jointly by
    Apple and Microsoft, a fact which amazed many hardcore Mac fans) and surrendered
    to the inevitable. CFF fonts have PostScript Type 1 outlines, but they're package
    inside a TrueType wrapper.\r\n\r\nThe point is, things change. Anyone want to
    buy a Jetson-style OS 9.3 iMac?"
