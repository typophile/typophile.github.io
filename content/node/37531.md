body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a type specimen and the chosen theme is Corporate
  BS, that hollow language used by corporations worldwide. \r\nI've found generators
  <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/matt999h/bullshit.htm\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.atrixnet.com/bs-generator.html\">here</a>.
  But as specimens go, some of the sentences are too long, and maybe not as annoying
  as I want them to be.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\nredefine integrated users\r\nreinvent
  seamless content\r\norchestrate compelling channels\r\nexpedite holistic platforms\r\nenable
  impactful relationships\r\nredefine world-class content\r\nincentivise holistic
  synergies\r\ncompetently extend cutting-edge interfaces\r\nenergistically maximize
  24/7 interfaces\r\n\r\nIt could be just two words, somehow infected, like <em>synergy
  effect</em>. \r\n\r\nWhat expressions trigger your contempt? Would you be so kind
  to share? It'll be fun, it'll be a <strong>win-win situation!</strong>\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nFredrik\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    but there's a deadline hanging over me and I'm curious of what might pop out of
    your <em> Top of Mind awarenesses</em>. I did google \"Corporate statements\"
    though and found some pretty interesting stuff.\r\n\r\n> Orwell...\r\n\r\nNow
    wouldn't that be interesting, mixing quotes from Orwell with management language?
    Nicely intertwined. If it's going to be funny it can't be too obvious of course.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n> http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm\r\n\r\nRegarding bad writing,
    I did use Edward Bulwer-Lyttons immortal \"It was a dark and stormy night\" in
    a previous specimen I made.  \r\n\r\n"
