body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently had a look through a printers spec book from the 50s/60s
  and found this interesting display face called 'Novel Open'. Does anyone know if
  it's been digitised? I've googled it but you get a lot of results for those two
  terms!"

  body: It's great isn't it? It was from a type spec printed by Desmond Jeffery. I
    had the distinct privilege to inspect his archive recently for a show of his work
    I'm curating. Truly amazing typography and press work!
