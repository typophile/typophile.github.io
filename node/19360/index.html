  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Here's a question for you Illustrator Pros. Is there an extension/plugin that adds web/screen resize views to the current view sizes. 

In case you're not following: Down in the bottom left there's a pop-up menu with resize percentages ...100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%... I'm curious if there's a resize that works in web layout sizes like 800x600 or 1024x768 where it resizes your image to that percentage so that I don't have to change my actual screen resolution to those sizes to get the idea. 

I'm not really sure how to search for such a feature or if it even exists (might be worthwhile to submit as a possible new feature for the upcoming releases.) 

Any ideas would be great. 

* Appreciate if you didn't question my choice of using Illustrator to make web graphics, I prefer to start there then finish up in Photoshop. Thanks*</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Miss Tiffany, I really appreciate your suggestions, actually some of those tools seem really cool, but it's still not quite what I'm looking for. 

I'm clearly not expressing my needs right. 

Currently when I work in Illustator my monitor is set for 1280x1024 but most of the sites I do use a relative resolution of 800x600. When I work on them I have to switch my monitor resolution because I tend to make thing too large when I leave it at my original resolution. I hate loosing all that real estate in the larger resolution when I switch to the smaller resolution, so I was wondering if there was a quick Zoom/View feature that would allow me to keep my larger 1280X1024 resolution and only "zoom in" when I want to check to make sure I'm not making things too large. The work around I have now is thru my Video Card where I have to manually change the entire screen resolution (which usually takes a few seconds everytime, plus I don't know how good that is for the video card to constantly switch back and forth between resolutions so frequently. 

I hope that makes sense.  I just want to have a nice little button or drop-down menu in Illustator that just Zooms my image to simulate a different resolution from what I'm working in. 

Think Developer Tools extension for Firefox where you can resize the browser to different resolutions without actually changed the screen resolution. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Can you not just set up the zoomed in, simulated 800x600 view, then create a new window (Window > New) for working at detail, switching to the zoomed in view when you need to preview?

You could also save the zoomed in view (View > New View).
