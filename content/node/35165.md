body: Firstly, I greatly appreciate everyones assistance. I never imagined how difficult
  it would be choosing a font for my logo and business. Last request is if anyone
  knows if the attached font is available or if it is a custom one-off. Thanks in
  advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id font_5782.jpg]
