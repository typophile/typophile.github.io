body: I am going to apply for one of the coming summer workshops in Basel, which requires
  me to submit a digital portfolio of ten works. Does anyone have any suggestions
  as to what goes over well with the judges?

  body: "I don't think that really helps dezcom.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that
    you should pick work that has a strong typo-graphic influence. I would suggest
    showing a diversity of ideas and directions and also be honest in picking work
    that you're proud of and that reflects you.\r\n\r\nI hope you don't intend to
    come out a carbon-copy of these guys, as dezcom hints at. It's about listening
    to their ideas and choosing what touches you, what doesn't and how it can be appropriated
    into your own thoughts and methodology.\r\n\r\nI would also say don't be afraid
    to throw digital work into the equation. It's about form and content -- not imitative
    modernist print design or who's the most 'swiss'."

    there is no more literature on this than that you \"submit 10 pieces of work\".\r\n\r\nI
    doubt they want to see 10 similar works, and doubt they're looking for a generic
    applicant. Maybe take a risk on a few edgier piece. \r\n\r\nI really like their

    advantage to show an understanding of that. \r\n\r\nTo be honest though I hadn't
    studied Hofmann work/words, but I do know Arnheim very well. I'll catch up on
    Hofmann in the weeks to come.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, don't just grab works diverse in
    form and content - submit stuff that clearly demonstrates a technical acuity to
    communicate and the principles thereof. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
