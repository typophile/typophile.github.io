  body: "Just because an image looks like letters of the alphabet doesn't mean that
    it's a font. In this case, the image is most likely a custom designed logo. (I
    can't even tell if it's supposed to be qb or gb). \r\n\r\nThere is a font with
    vaguely similar letters called [[http://www.ffonts.net/Abode-Regular.font|\"Abode\",
    available here]].  Also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/weknow/pure-and-simple-everytime/regular/|Pure
    and Simple]], and a couple of others.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
