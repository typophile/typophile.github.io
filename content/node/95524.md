  body: I would guess (poorly) custom drawn, but it might be part of some free font.
    If these samples come from the same source it is more likely that it is a custom
    thing.

  body: "I can only confirm what you said, it looks like Spinwerad but customized,
    some kind of unicase version of it (not so hard to reproduce)./e is too much distinctive
    and identical to Spinwerad to be a coincidence. But now, if you're still convinced
    it's a totally different font, you could take your chance by asking directly the
    designer in charge of these designs.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Finally... Same foundry, sharing
    same design backbone, some kind of \"Spinwerad unicase bold\", [[http://www.glukfonts.pl/font.php?l=en&font=Itsadzoke|Itsadzoke]]"
