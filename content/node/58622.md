body: "This is not a release notice. However, in a couple of months, the Fontry will
  release three fonts with a patriotic theme. They are the brain storm of Mike Adkins.
  The package consists of font files (regular, bold, italic) which form the components
  of the stars and stripes over the regular font. This is a how to for using the fonts.
  Your thoughts and opinions of the document would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJLS\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Patriot500_5299.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe

    really appreciate what you\u2019re doing, it reminds me of the packaging of GI
    Joe toys from the 1980s and is totally appropriate. But I wonder if a simpler
    set of instructions might be useful for people who might get distracted by the
    stars and stripes and miss the explanation. There are a lot of designers who can
    barely cope with their software to begin with, try to take it easy on them.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    do you really need to keep the named of the layer fonts as Italic, Normal-Italic,
    etc? Or could you name them after their functions?"

  body: "@James: I'd imagine the thinking behind the \"italic, bold-italic\" etc.,
    style naming is so that semi-savvy users can apply the second variety simply by
    hitting the italics/bold buttons in their applications rather than having to manually
    go back to the font list dropdown to re-select the next font. \r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver
