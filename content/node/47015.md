body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_3670.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\nComalle is an organic
  roman typeface that recovers some elements proper of handwritten letter forms, even
  though its strokes do not necessarily refer to a literal calligraphic structure.\r\n\r\n.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6676.gif]\r\nIn
  order to produce a powerful impact on the page, Comalle has thicker strokes than
  its counter forms. This makes the black of the letter to fill the page thus causing
  a faster visual impact than other typefaces of similar black and white balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3422.gif]\r\nOne
  of the most important challenges in the design of Comalle was precisely the balance
  of black and white areas in the typeface. Interestingly, that precision work would
  not produce the blacks, but the whites of the letter forms. This is why at first
  all the efforts were put in the generality rather than the details, but in the end
  the design of the counter space proved to be by far the major visual feature of
  the new typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\n.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4285.gif]\r\nComalle
  was conceived at the careful draining and filling of letter forms and thus intends
  both to charm with its delicate counters and impact the reader with the heavy strokes
  that conform its unique personality.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000327#about\r\n
