body: In the past I have designed "textured" looking faces by rendering with pencil,
  photographing, tracing (in freehand mx at the time), then copy/pasting into fontographer.
  I recently have designed a face, rendered it in chalk, vectorized it and am now
  attempting to copy it from ai into Fontlab. I have even tried copying it into Fontographer.
  Is there anyone out there that can suggest a work flow that will help me achieve
  success? Are there preferences that I can change that I am missing?

  body: "My guess is that it's a crapload of overlapping nodes created by Illustrator's
    not-so-hot autotrace routine that make FontLab freak out. If so you might be able
    to merge the stacked nodes by option-clicking the merge button in pathfinder.
    But that's just a guess.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, try copying over small sections
    or even individual paths, one at a time. That might allow you to get a simple
    enough mess to see what is really going on in the Illustrator paths."

    and paths, \"Don't send an Adobe Illustrator to do a Macromedia Freehand's job.\"
    Thanks for the thoughts guys.\r\n\r\nGus"
