    looks a bit closer (mainly because of /S), at least for "RUDOS". I''m not even
    positive it is the same font for the 2 words but I guess you could easily substitute
    the all thing with Powerstation and recreate this /N which looks custom to me
    (only character not to have corners cut).'
