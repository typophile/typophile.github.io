  doesn't really need any more type designers, that there are plenty of excellent
  typefaces to go around, and way to many crappy ones littering our culture.\r\n\r\nToday,
  my boss told me that I could shop for some type to use in some posters rather than
  go with the Marker Felt that we had handy in our type library. Dream come true.
  So I went shopping. It started here, with a search for the classic Mr. Dom Casual,
  which took me to [[http://typophile.com/node/19380|this node]].\r\n\r\nI honestly
  cannot believe how many incredible, beautiful typefaces I just looked at through
  the links provided there. I'm in awe. The people who create these things are obviously
  incredibly talented, well-studied, and rehearsed; and I imagine they come from all
  walks of life...the last thing I want to do is stifle the next up-and-comer. If
  that's you, pay attention to these people and follow your dreams. \r\n\r\nThank
  you all for giving people like me the tools we need to make the world a more beautiful
  place."

    your boss orderered you to do so, a year is a hell lot of time.\r\n\r\nbut hey!
    better late than never.\r\n\r\ndr"

    have mattered much at the time, trust me. As a department, we had some things
    to work through. But things are changing a little bit around here, for the better.
    That patience...she's frustrating sometimes, but always comes through in the end.\r\n\r\n"
