  is a pretty fancy computer display that looks like it uses a single font at numerous
  different sizes.  This font is clean and crisp, and I'd love to know what it is.\r\n\r\nThere
  is a sample below; you can also find the trailer here:\r\n[[http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/quantumofsolace/]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/query_dominic_greene_5431.png]\r\n\r\nThanks!"
