  body: ' Froedi - this is very classy and feminine. I can&#39;t see much about it
    that I&#39;d change besides the tail on the &#39;y&#39; and the &#39;high&#39;
    crossbar on the &#39;f&#39;. Nice, elegant work. <BR> <BR>One thing I would do
    is add weights. This thin of a weight...it&#39;s difficult to find uses. Oh &#43;
    an uppercase. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
    <BR> <BR>Also, see the bezier work of Christian Robertson in this forum and Bernhard
    Fashion. <BR> <BR>If you can design an uppercase that matches the elegance of
    the lowercase, then you&#39;ll have something special. <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '
