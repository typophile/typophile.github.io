  body: "Ha! Looks like it is Candara. I knew it was familiar, but I didn't have it
    on my Mac at work. I did also look at The Sans.\r\n\r\nThe subtle variations in
    stroke width are lost in the pixels of the JPG, so I thought I was looking for
    something less humanist.\r\n\r\nThanks very much!"
