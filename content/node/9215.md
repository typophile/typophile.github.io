body: 'I&#39;m an artist and novelist, and became convinced several years ago that
  I should make a private font for my books. I acquired Fontographer, and have since
  spent many delightful hours twiddling the little sticks. I now have something I&#39;m
  pretty pleased with, but have several problems. Keep in mind that I&#39;m basically
  computer illiterate - terms like &#34;hinting&#34; and &#34;vectors&#34; are algebra
  to me. I failed algebra. So any explanations will have to be in &#34;Jane sees Spot
  run&#34; language. <BR> <BR>First question - I was generating my font in TrueType,
  but then accidentally hit the Type I button one day, and it came out sharper &#40;why
  is this?&#41;. Unfortunately, a couple symbols are messed up now: the em dash lances
  the letter following it, and there&#39;s too much space after the apostrophe. I&#39;ve
  checked the spacing, and it seems fine. What can I do to fix this?  <BR> <BR>Another
  problem, both in TrueType and Type I: I can&#39;t get the fi and fl symbols to print
  - they come up in a different font. <BR> <BR>Now, I&#39;d love to be able to post
  a sample of my font in your critique forum, but I&#39;ve never done anything like
  this. I have a new Dell computer with the new Windows on it. Will it have what I
  need to post? I read that I need jpeg or something. How do I put my font into this
  jpeg so you can read it? Could some kind person walk me through this process? <BR>
  <BR>Thanks, <BR>Keith'

  body: Thanks, Hrant. Sorry to pester, but like I said, I&#39;m computer-retarded,
    so what is a GIF and how do I make a nice large one? <BR> <BR>Keith

  body: 'GIF is an image format that most any graphic app &#40;like Photoshop&#41;
    can save out. It&#39;s perfect for type specimens - it&#39;s tight: small files
    with no loss or artefacts &#40;like JPEG&#41;. As long as an image has no photos
    or gradations, GIF rules. <BR> <BR>Size: if you&#39;re going to upload it directly
    do Typophile &#40;as opposed to putting it on a site somewhere and providing the
    link&#41; don&#39;t make it <i>too</i> big! :-/  Like 600x400 or something should
    be good. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Keith, <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t have Photoshop then either save your type
    as a PDF or Print it out and scan it in at least a high dpi. That will at least
    give some idea. <BR> <BR>Or get a computer savvy friend to help. <BR> <BR>DeWitt

  body: Keith <BR> <BR>In regard to your problems with Fontographer, it is very important
    that you configure your preferences quite carefully and follow the recommendations
    regarding metrics. [the same applies to FontLab] The Fontographer help site is
    useful <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/fontographer/technotes.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/fontographer/technotes.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>but a bit confusing. In the days prior to Macromedia&#39;s ownership
    of Fontographer there was an Altsys sponsored help manual &#40;it was known as
    the &#34;underground manual&#34;&#41; that was floating around the web. Much of
    that is still available on site but it is scattered around. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    cribbed a bit of that to show a simple sequence for altering existing fonts &#40;for
    letterpress configuration&#41;. See entry October 1 here <BR> <BR><a href="http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/"
    target="_blank">http://bielerpress.blogspot.com/</a> <BR> <BR>While this may or
    may not be useful to you note it conveys that you must pay very careful attention
    to your preference settings regarding character set positioning and the manner
    and sequence for generating the metrics. <BR> <BR>Gerald
