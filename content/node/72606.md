body: "Hi wondering if anyone can help with this one....\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find
  a typeface similar to the sample. This is a unreleased font from a logo designer.\r\nI
  love the e,s,o characters and have searched all my resources for a font that has
  a similar aesthetic.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'm looking for a font with a slight change
  in thickness through certain characters like the e and c in the Tectone example.
  (I posted this example the other week but no one could id it)\r\n\r\nAlso included
  is a sample pic of some more typography that has the same qualities, 'factory shop'
  (apologies for the terrible picture quality its the best I could find) and 'slim
  fast' logotype\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/miona1_4408.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tica_4598.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/37475_429618747056_691087056_5154956_2324708_n_5538.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/optima_5169.jpeg]"
