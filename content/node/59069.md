  that I keep seeing but cannot ID. \r\n\r\nHere are two places to quickly see it:\r\n\r\nwww.militarystencils.com
  \ (font of web page title, example below).\r\n\r\nwww.columbiarovers.com (in their
  logo).\r\n\r\n\r\nI've searched and searched and come very close but not exact.
  The \"M\" gives away the font I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\nGarrett[img:sites/default/files/old-images/USMCstencil_3828.jpg]"
