  can be downloaded from Dunwichtype.com.</a>\r\n\r\nDTF Decomposer is a script intended
  for producing final versions of fonts that contain overlaps and composites that
  would otherwise require manual intervention. It first decomposes glyphs supplied
  in a list. It then removes overlaps in all glyphs and corrects path directions.\r\n\r\nDTF
  Mark overlaps checks all glyphs for overlaps and marks a glyph when an overlap is
  found. It can find overlaps in glyphs that contain only outlines, only components,
  or outlines and components. It is not especially fast, but it is much faster than
  manual inspections. Sometimes glyphs that do not actually contain overlaps will
  be marked. This is because Fontlab's remove overlap function removes stray anchor
  points it deems unnecessary, such as anchor points on straight lines.\r\n\r\nNeither
  script has been optimized to run as fast as it could, but they are both a lot faster
  than manual operations, especially when finishing families."

  body: "So after an hour it's done. Your script is more precise like Fontlab itself
    on Type1 export.\r\n\r\nCould it be it finds outlines that overlap not directly
    but one knot is placed on top of an other knot?\r\n"

    is placed on top of an other knot?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt works by making two copies
    of a glyph. All components in each glyph are decomposed, then the remove overlaps
    function is applied to one copy. Then all anchor point locations in both copies
    are dumped to strings, the strings get hash()ed, and then the hashes are compared.
    If they don't match, the glyph is assumed to contain overlaps. The downside to
    this method is that glyphs with lots of anchor points will take a long time to
    check."

  body: "Hi James,\r\n\r\nthanks for the idea about how to detect overlaps. I hope
    you don't mind, I rewrote your script to use pure FontLab, no RoboFab. That way
    it runs a lot faster. Additionally, I stop the comparison of points of a glyph
    as soon as a difference is found, that makes it faster too. And the last thing,
    you don't need to add the temporary glyphs to the font window. Drawing stuff on
    screen repeatedly makes things slow. I just make copies in memory using the copy
    constructors for <code>Font()</code> and <code>Glyph()</code>. The script now
    takes 1 second as compared to 258 seconds before on one of my fonts ;)\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n#FLM:

    using it today and I would like to point that although it does a fantastic work
    detecting overlapped components and contours, it does fail to detect when a component
    is overlapped by a contour. Can it be addressed as well?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nR."
