  body: InStyle masthead has been designed by [[http://www.typedesign.com/logos/instyle.html|Jim
    Parkinson]]. As said on this page, it's a "Refinement and finishing of a design
    by Rip Georges. It's based on a 1895 type specimen and first appeared on the first
    issue." A very close alternative would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/ronsard-crystal|Ronsard
    Crystal]] Bold.

  body: "\u20181895 specimen\u2019 sounds interesting \u2026 I only knew this typeface
    as \u2018Industria\u2019, designed by Hermann Zehnpfund for the type foundry Emil
    Gursch in Berlin from 1910 to 1913. The foundry was taken over by Berthold who
    added more weights in 1920 and 1923. Here is a reference on the [[http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Zehnpfundt/HZehnpfundt.pdf|website
