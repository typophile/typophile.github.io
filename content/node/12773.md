body: "I am trying to convert my old armenian fonts to unicode. I have a lot of fonts
  and I was thinking if there is a pyhton script that can help me. What I need is
  a script similar to the \"Rename glyphs by scheme [TTG]\" script, only it has to
  renumber the glyphs from one unicode # to another.\r\n\r\nIs there any such script?"

  body: The easiest way to do this is simply to build a new .nam file that associates
    glyph names to Unicode values. Then all you need to do is apply the "Generate
    Unicode' function in FontLab.
