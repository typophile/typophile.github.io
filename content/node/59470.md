  body: "This looks a lot like [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/konabold.shtml|Kona
    Bold]] by Chuck Davis at Letterhead Fonts. The SC effect looks faked.  Your sample
    looks a bit lighter in weight and proportioned slightly differently than the base
    font. This could be due to graphic manipulation and/or some white outlining.\r\n\r\n-
