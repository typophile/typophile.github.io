  and the font needs to match \"UMJCOM+QuicksandBook Regular.\" The text copies all
  correctly in that font except tht any letter with an accent copies as an empty space.
  Any help or ideas? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMaggie"

  body: Hello, I'm new to this forum and just happened to see your message on this
    section. I wonder if you ever resolved your issue. If you still need help please
    let us know. I'm puzzled by the UMJCOM in front of the font name. I'm not familiar
    with that.
