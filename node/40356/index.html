"Whack" is used in computer jargon. One might say "h t t p, colon, whack whack" to describe "http://". Since the different directions are interchangeable in certain computer networking applications, a whack could also go the other way. "whack whack servername" is "\\\SERVERNAME\". </div>

Some of them may be made up. Do any of the terms you list have citations with verifiable references? If not, you can't trust them. As a Wikipedian myself I know Wikipedia to be a crank magnet---the most powerful crank magnet in the universe. While working on type-related articles there I discovered a lot of programmer-like geeks working on them as well. They consider themselves qualified to write on typography matters, which is absurd really, all things considered, and they have an annoying habit of introducing terms and jargon from the programming world. They justify it by saying that programmers use these terms for writing code.
If you guys see anything questionable or dubious in Wikipedia's typography articles and it has no citation or reference, jump right in there and put this tag next to the suspect text:
{fact}
That generates a [citation needed] tag in the rendered article. You don't need to be a registered Wikipedian to do it. Anyone can challenge what's there. If the author(s) who put the unreferenced material in fail to come up with a valid reference within two months it is considered acceptable to remove the unsourced material.
Some people I work with call a slash a "forward slash", but it's hard to see the point when "slash" makes perfect sense contrasted with "backslash".

<div class=commentbody><em>Some people I work with call a slash a “forward slash”, but it’s hard to see the point when “slash” makes perfect sense contrasted with “backslash”.</em>
I suspect these are mostly Windows users who are used to using the backslash for path names and therefore are prone to use it instead of a slash in URLs out of habit. Calling it a forward slash helps to make it clearer for them (although I sometimes hear people on the radio mistakenly saying "backslash" when reciting a URL). "Forward slash" sounds odd mainly to non-Windows users who don't use the backslash so much.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>One time on the talk page for Wikipedia:font (typeface), a user asked if the origin story for "upper case" and "lower case" was a lot of hokum somebody made up. This guy said something like, "That sounds like an urban myth, as if typesetters in metal days actually had an upper case and a lower case. Glad to meet you, I'm Lincoln's grandfather."
I assured the person the origin story is true---to the best of our knowledge.
Mark---yes, in all likelihood you are right about "backslash".
<em>What about using the term “cut”? I think that is right in there with “leading”.</em>
Interesting you should bring that up: I reject terms like "foundry" and make a point of not using that word, saying "font maker" or "type designer" instead. Yet I don't think twice about calling line height "leading". "Cut" will probably be around forever, no matter what medium font makers use to draw type outlines with. Cut is almost synonymous with line and outline.

Well, isn't that still typography? Granted, anything written in a resource like wikipedia should be verified, but it seems that one of the great things about wikipedia is it's contemporary vernacular. But I do see your point as well. Perhaps there's a need for articles to have a section on 'contemporary variations' or the like.
FYI, this is a great thread!
Mark: I'm ashamed...even having worked at a letterpress shop, I've never heard of Electrotype or Stereotype...what are those?

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Furniture - Usually wood, but could be metal pieces which fill in the chase (which see) of a letterpress printer; held tightly in place by quoins (which see). This "word of art" is found in other industries, where it can mean any wooden component part of the whole. For example, a wooden gunstock is the gun's furniture.
Copy-fitting
Fist - Guess: a group of Linotype or Intertype slugs lifted from the machine's output tray and taken (in one's fisted hand, from which comes this "word of art") to a composing station, usually passing a Hammond cutoff saw first to adjust the length as required by the job.
Slug - A cast line of Linotype or Intertype type
Logotype

Quad - Mechanism on a Linotype or Intertype which mechanically fills in the line; can be quad left, quad center or quad right, as set on the mechanism's control; it is an add-on accessory for most older machines, say, a Model 15, and may be standard on later machines; often found on machines installed in newspapers.
Mortise - Guess: Related to furniture, but I can't remember how.
Quoin & quoin key - Rectangular (one piece) or wedge-shaped (two piece) device which tightens the furniture (which see) in the chase; once so tightened, the chase may be safely moved from the composing station and installed in the letterpress printer. Quoins are operated by a quoin key.
Electrotype
Stereotype
(Actually, modern letterpress printers will know a lot of these.)

<div class=commentbody>Furniture is any spacing material.
A fist is one of those pointing hand dingbats.
A slug is also just a piece of type.
A quad is a standard space, measured in ems or ens, such as an em quad or en quad. When you say "quad left" or "quad right" it just means "fill out the line with quads," pushing the line to the left or right.
A mortise is a border or illustration cut with a hole in it in which to place type.
A quoin key is the thing you use to tighten a quoin.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Well, isn’t that still typography? Granted, anything written in a resource like wikipedia should be verified, but it seems that one of the great things about wikipedia is it’s contemporary vernacular. But I do see your point as well. Perhaps there’s a need for articles to have a section on ’contemporary variations’ or the like.</em>
The accepted solution to most Wikipedia content disputes is, or has been, to join the Inclusionist Church of Wikipedia, which has the largest number of followers. To achieve a neutral point of view, multiple authors working on a single article include all points of view established as valid, with criteria for notability and verification. Readers are left to decide the relevance of the various points of view for themselves.
The NPOV requirement is the reason why, for example, Wikipedia's main type history article is titled <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_western_typography target=_new>History of Western Typography</a>: an Asian contributor pointed out my initial breach of NPOV, concensus was established at the Village Pump, and the title was changed.
You are quite right in pointing to the contemporary nature of the newer terms. Wikipedia has always been the bleeding edge in Encyclopedestrianization. The reality of Encyclopedestrianization has its shock value for everyone.

As in, if one steps out of the press room and says "... I left a hickey on this page." more people will think he is oddly perverse than will think he needs to keep the keep the dust down in the press room. [|:¬)
(not strictly a type word admittedly)
- Out of curiosity... The skills of the first gunsmiths were borrowed from medieval locksmiths. Hence the term, lock stock and barrel, which originally referred to parts on a lock (and had nothing to do with the wooden parts or the long metal tube the bullet comes out of). Are there similar terms transferred from from trades the printing industry would have borrowed from?

When used as a noun, yes.
When used as a verb on a linecaster (Linotype and Intertype, and possibly also on a Monotype, although I've never operated a Monotype typecaster), or with specific reference to a quadder as a noun, it refers to the mechanism or the operation thereof, which is attached as an accessory to, or is built into the linecaster, and which effects quadding, left, right or center, without the use of true quads (em or en, or whatever, as matrices) combined with adjustable spacebars.</div>

Historically, where do minuscule and majuscule fit in, with specific respect to the California Job Case?
I learned to set type by hand, in the 1950s, from a California Job Case, and I cannot recall encountering a different case.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The term “virgule” goes way back before typesetting, back to the mediæval era. OED (2nd edn. 1989) says:
“1. A thin sloping or upright line (/, |) occurring in mediæval MSS. as a mark for the cæsura or as a punctuation-mark (frequently with the same value as the modern comma). Now also in more general use with various functions (see quots.). Cf. SLASH <em>n.</em>¹ 5”
“Solidus” is used by Unicode, and was metaphorically transferred from the symbol separating shillings from pence, since “shilling” is an equivalent to “solidus” which was the Roman gold coin worth about 25 <em>denarii</em> (which itself is the source of “d.” for pence). OED gives this as sense 2:
“2. A sloping line used to separate shillings from pence, as 12/6, in writing fractions, and for other separations of figures and letters; a shilling-mark. Also <em>attrib.</em> Cf. OBLIQUE <em>n.</em> 5.”
“Oblique” has its first citation in the OED (sense 4) at 1785, although the first citation referring specifically to the typographic sense is from 1965: “1965 W. S. ALLEN <em>Vox Latina</em> 9 Phonemic symbols..are conventionally set between obliques, e.g. /t/.”
“Scratch comma” is attested in the OED under sense V.12.b of SCRATCH: “scratch-comma, a diagonal stroke used by some early printers in place of the comma”
On the other hand, the OED doesn’t have a lemma for “seperatrix”, which strikes me as suspect anyway.
Feel free to deposit this info in the Wikipedia article. I can’t be bothered at the moment.

Also: Electrotype was used by pirates to copy fonts.
. . . . .
I would like to avoid niceties of language. Stereotypes (accredited to Firmin Didot) were used for newspapers, publishers and for other reasons, magazines, job printing, not to mention national advertising campaigns, when do I stop? If not here?
"Electro-deposited matrices" were not only used by pirates but also by legitimates foundries maintaining their own fount matrix libraries, and, for example, producing legitimate copies for their clients. Common in the sorts department of the Lanston Monotype Machine foundry.
I can see the difference. Can you?
I could provide more details on Stereotypes, and Electroplates, not mentioned hear as I can not comprehend a need to know?

<div class=commentbody>OK. Here's the possibly offensive one. Sometimes "deadwood" was set with sorts that were type high, but that had no image on them. They were rectangles that printed black. And they were very easy for proofreaders and comps to spot.
In many hot-metal shops, even unto the 1980s, the term for them was "niggerhead." In fact, that is the only term I ever heard for them. & I was pretty startled.

****************
Let me also clarify "deadwood". That term is used not only for numerical placeholders. Any matter set to indicate where a compositor is to insert other sorts is known as "deadwood." Or "bogus." I worked at a Monotype shop where we had to insert Greek, Cyrillic, and Chinese by hand. Keyboard operators set deadwood to the approximately correct width and we comps would insert the non-Latin.
****************
"Workups" were pushed down with special awls known in the type and printing trades as "bodkins." Or sometimes with a "palm rule." I wish I still had a set of those.
That's it for tonight. Gotta go shovel snow.

Well, the most frequently quoted surely are ‘Hurenkind’ [child of a bitch] for ‘widow’ and ‘Schusterjunge’ [cobbler boy] for ‘orphan’ …
A voluminous printed matter free of errors – without having made a single correction – is a ‘Jungfrau(enwunder)’ [‘virgin (miracle)’ – yes, printers & typesetters are/were predominantly male], ‘Leading’ is called ‘Durchschuss’ [‘shot right through’?], a ‘Zwiebelfisch’ [onion fish] is a letter accidentally set in a different font (or a letter put in the wrong case), and an upside-down metal letter (so that the cone’s bottom leaves its print) is a ‘Fliegenkopf’ [fly’s head].
There are a lot more; and yes, I’d like to learn about some more from Erik’s experienced vocabulary, too – especially if they aren’t included in <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druckersprache>this Wikipedia list</a>.
<a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/romibello/465006308/>This map, the ‘Typographiae Imperii Accurata Tabula’</a>, is packed with type and printing terms, a lot of them ‘arcane’, most of them in German.

<div class=commentbody><em>Zwiebelfisch [onion fish] is a letter accidentally set in a different font (or a letter put in the wrong case)</em>
No, a letter in the wrong case is just a Fisch (fish). A “verfischter Kasten” is a case full of wrong fonts. Sounds like a kosher sandwich, but was more often than not left to the apprentices (like me) to clean up. Which entailed setting <em>all</em> the type from the case into the composing stick to sort good from bad. And then “dissing” it back, as we called that in London.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@eliason: <em>Some of Wikipedia’s listed synonyms for the slash are new to me: “oblique, diagonal, whack, separatrix, virgule, scratch comma, slant, or forward slash.” Have any of you called it a whack, a separatrix, or a scratch comma before?</em>
@aluminium: <em>Well, isn’t that still typography? ...Perhaps there’s a need for articles to have a section on ’contemporary variations’ or the like.</em>
I question whether what programmers do can be considered, or defined, as typography. Writing code is a form of typesetting in the sense that letters are set, but is it really typesetting or typography? I submit that it is not, because the goal of programming is not to set type in an aesthetically pleasing and coherent manner, but to write code to control the functions of a computer. Two different activites or professions are equated and conflated.
The definition of typography is being broadened to include things which are not typographic, but linguistic or semantic. Certain tasks in programming are being conflated with typography tasks.
So if the inclusionist philosophy wins in this absurd encyclopedestrianization of everything, and terms used by programmers must be included in typography articles because they are "contemporary vernacular", the sensible thing to do is make it clear what came from where, distinguish between typography and "codesetting". That would be a useful word for it. When composing you are typesetting, when writing code you are codesetting.

<div class=commentbody>Twip is probably a term from modern-day typography, either phototypesetting, or the TrueType spec.
But the term "tittle" occurs in the Bible; the phrase "jot or tittle" means either the small Hebrew letter Yod, or a vowel point.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The use of twip in typography is new to me.
In computing it is a unit of measurement equal to 1/1440 of an inch, i.e. 1/20 of a PS point, and is used as a base unit of measurement in quite a lot of software.</div>

@John Hudson:
The use of the term "twip" in computing to refer to 1/20th of a <em>point</em> makes it a typographical term, not just a computing one. Even if it's only used... at the edges of the typographical community as it were.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's true that an inch is not a motoring term merely because it is a subdivision of a mile. But the fact that a twip is a subdivision of a point does strongly indicate it was used by people who were working with causing text to be imaged on paper.
So I considered it to qualify as a typographical term on the basis that it is still a typographical term when it is used by computer geeks playing at typography instead of by Real Typographers. But that would make it an <em>obscure</em> typographical term, because you would not find it in looking at a book about typography!
It seems to be part of Microsoft's Rich Text Format, along with being used in Visual Basic - and, yes, Microsoft is credited as originating the term.</div>
