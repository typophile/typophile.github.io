  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear, typophiles!  <BR> <BR>I am writing this letter, because recently I found &quot;<a href="http://www.sessions.edu" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.sessions.edu">www.sessions.edu</a></a>&quot;. As you know my origin is bulgarian and thus I am unable to afford a substantial tuition in the field of graphic design. Currently I am designing and accumulating money in order to invest in my future education.  <BR>This thread is simply for some feedback about the &quot;Graphic Design Master's Certificate&quot; found at &quot;<a href="http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html">http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html</a></a>&quot;.  <BR>My main concern is : &quot;Does it worth it?&quot;;&quot;Would the certificate be valued by employers?  <BR>In general, please comment on this specific master's program for graphic design.  <BR> <BR>All your words will be highly appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Sincerely,  <BR>Galin K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Galin, <BR>Everything that Dana said is absolutely true.  No one ever asked to see any of my diplomas.  The questions then becomes, what will the school teach me that will help me create a good portfolio to get a job; what will the school teach me to help me actually do my job (and therefore keep my job); and what will it teach me so that I can further teach myself throughout my life to grow.  Think of school as a swimmers racing dive.  Any dive (or school) will get you wet; a better dive (school) will move you further along and allow you to keep pace with the competition; the better racing dive and design school will launch you into the lead.  This supposes you have the talent, drive, and willingness to work hard enough to take advantage of what the school has to offer.  A school will maximize who you are from what you bring to it. If you are water, it can make you clear and refreshing.  If you are wine, it can make you robust and appealing.  However, no school can change water into wine. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think comparing demand to see a diploma versus a portfolio is misleading, because a client would only ask to see the former if he suspects you of lying*, while he <i>needs</i> to see the &quot;innards&quot; of the latter to figure out what you can do, and if your specific skills and talents are compatible with what he needs. So a better question would be: What proportion of clients ask you about your formal education (or check it out on your resume)? <BR> <BR>* And is furthermore willing to reveal that. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Galin, <BR> <BR>I believe that you're asking if it's worth your money for an online course or if you should keep saving. <BR> <BR>I don't know about this particular online school, but my caution is how much more are you going to get from an online course that you can't get from a book? Other than critiques, what more are they offering you? I'd write them a letter and ask just how much more you'll benefit. Also, ask for their credentials. <BR> <BR>You might also try finding a number for a professor at any design school, explain your position, and ask him/her what they think. My experience is that people are very helpful. And often, they might suggest another alternative of which you are not yet aware. <BR> <BR>Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Post graduate work is becoming more important in the U. S. and is considered mandatory if you want to teach, but beyond that portfolio is still the thing that gets you work. As for online educaiton, I may be prejudiced, but I think in person works much better. It's vastly easier and more productive to work in person with a teacher and with others. Seeing what others are doing in response to similar design problems and getting feedback from different people is very important. I'd say, keep saving your money for a real school. <BR>George</div>
