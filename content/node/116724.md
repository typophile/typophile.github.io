  en dash style in text, what should be used for breaks of thoughts and interruptions
  \u2013 en or em dashes?\r\n\r\nHow do you deal with acronyms in italicized passages
  if you've been using small caps throughout the text and, like in most fonts, you
  don't  have italic small caps?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of small caps, is there a special
  case when they begin a sentence (inside a paragraph)?"

    the ends of the second and third paragraphs.\r\nAs you can see I also use guillemets
    in English.\r\nThe em-dash I use rarely, like for an attribution with space(s)
    in it:\r\n\"\u2014 Gustave Flaubert\" (versus \"\u2013 Heraclitus\")\r\n\r\nMake
    your own style. Just base it on logic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Questions regarding dashes are usually decided by a project's writer, using
    the style guide they've chosen. If there is no writer, buy a good style guide
    for reference. You can find a list of common guides here:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide\r\n\r\nIf
    a paragraph begins with a small cap I might ask the writer to reword the sentence
    for a better appearance. If they don't want to, I'd stick with small caps to be
    consistent with the style I'm using elsewhere (assuming the small caps are intended
    as capitol letters, which is usually the case, like in an acronym such as NASA)."

  body: I always use EM dashes with no spacing. It looks a little over-the-top, but
    that's why  like it.

    you\u2019re using can\u2019t fulfil them, use a different font. In this case,
    one that has italic small caps (I\u2019m not sure \u201Cmost\u201D don\u2019t
    if you use quality type). This sort of thing is why, if you make a book for instance,
    you want to be as sure as you possibly can that the fonts of your choice cover
    everything you need before you start typesetting. (I\u2019m aware this isn\u2019t
    always possible, but it\u2019s a good rule.)\r\n\r\nAnd yes, no emdashes in European
    usage. In the usage you mentioned I\u2019d probably use a non-spaced endash. But
    yes, check with writer/editor/publisher for existing/preferred style guides."
