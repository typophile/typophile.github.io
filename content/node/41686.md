body: "Hello,\r\n \r\nI spotted this on a recent trip to Washington at Reagan airport
  and was intrigued by the extended \"Northwest\" type. The flat ends of the S threw
  me off because initially I thought this was as Aksidenz with the straight leg of
  the R. Any ideas? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reagan-gate-small_5317.jpg]"

    Blair</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/trade_gothic_lt_std_bold_extended_ot/?sample_text=NORTHWEST&sample_size=48">Trade
    Gothic Extended</a> are also similar, albeit with the angled 'S' ends.

    Gothic Wide</a> which does have a flat-ended 'S' but whose rounds are more square.

  body: "Does Akzidenz Grotesk have an extended cut? Maybe it's that. EDIT: Yes it
    does, but I can't seem to find a type tester on the Berthold site to type \"Northwest.\"\r\n\r\nI
    think House Industries did a custom font for Dulles, but that's not the same airport
    right? Reagan used to be Washington International, right?\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: Unfortunately, FontShop doesn't carry Berthold fonts so you can't test 'er
    there. But here's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-be/bold-extended/testdrive.html?refby=typographica">Akzidenz
    Bold Extended</a> on MyFonts. That could be it.

    will try and upload a scan from an old VGC catalog later.

    minimal.

    target="_blank">Annonce</a> is available digitally. Very nice find, Yves.
