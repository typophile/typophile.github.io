body: So Gap, Inc. changed their logo a more "helvetica" like look.   But it's not
  Helvetica, the 'a' is different.  What is it?

  body: "Yawn.\r\n\r\nI don't even think of logos using Helvetica as logos. I just
    see a word set in Helvetica. I find it hard to believe so many large corporations
    pay a fortune to design companies for them to produce a word set in Helvetica.
    Is that really the best they can produce? \r\n\r\nYeah, I really couldn't be bothered
    thinking of anything or expending any effort whatsoever so I did this. \r\n\r\nGet
    somebody from marketing to do the usual client bamboozle.\r\n\r\nNot that I'm
    cynical about this business or anything."

  body: "This is unbelievable! Gap is such a short word it will look lazy set in anything
    but custom lettering. The blue square. My oh my, the blue square.\r\n\r\n(I once
    wrote on Typophile about how much I disliked the 2012 Olympic logo. Here's my
    chance to eat my hat and say that I have actually really warmed to that one.)"
