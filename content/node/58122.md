body: "Here's the situation and I'm not sure if it can be done or if I'm just losing
  myself.\r\n\r\nGiven two base glyphs, I'd like to change the first one if the second
  has a combining mark.  However, the first one can have 0-\u221E combining mark.\r\n\r\nHence
  my problem.  In this case I'd like to ignore combining marks on one part and ignore
  the base glyph on the second part, which would leave me with a simple \"when X is
  followed by [list of combining marks], change to Y\".\r\n\r\nIn regex it'd be <code>(B1)[`\xB4\xA8]*B2[`\xB4\xA8]+</code>.
  \  Do I ask too much of OpenType?"

  body: "This is a really difficult one. There's two possible approaches:\r\n\r\n1.
    Presuppose a limit on the number of combining marks that might be applied to the
    first glyph, and then include multiple context strings along the lines of\r\n\r\n[process
    -marks-]\r\nX -> Y\r\n...\r\n| -marks- -marks- -marks- -marks- Z -marks-\r\n|
    -marks- -marks- -marks- Z -marks-\r\n| -marks- -marks- Z -marks-\r\n| -marks-
    Z -marks-\r\n| Z -marks-\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Include duplicate glyphs for the Z triggers
    and first perform a separate substitution when Z is followed by a mark:\r\n\r\n[process
    -marks-]\r\nZ -> Z.premark\r\n| -marks-\r\n\r\n[process NONE]\r\nX -> Y\r\n| Z"

  body: "Those were the two that came to mind, though I was hoping to nail it with
    just one.  The first one would probably work for all intents and purposes, but
    the programmer in me hates it.  I guess I'll go ahead with the second one, as
    I suppose it's not too much messier than ligatureless ligatures when you have
    a three-deep f design.\r\n\r\nI wonder if such regex-style matching could be added
    into an OpenType 1.7 (image what you could do with it) or if we'll have to look
    beyond OT.  I can think of quite a few uses beyond my eample and a few handwriting
    things."
