		<div class="commentbody">Uhm&hellip; Hrant, how would you define a RESULT in a creative experiment. Isn't part of the charme of an experiment that you don't know the results. Although it would be nice to have an ex-post-analysis of, say, the 80s/90s post-digital-typographic-experimentation, I don't think it should matter to those who DO the experiments what is the actual outcome of their work. I think in experimentating, the process, the finding-out-about-things or the plaing-around-without-things is very much in the foreground, it is very much an explorative, not a teleological animal.</div>

Unorthodox design is explained away as 'experimental', often as a means of ducking criticism of the results. There is a presupposition that all experiments are successful experiments, justified entirely by their experimental nature rather than by either their goals or their results. True experimental design follows an experimental path: hypothesis, procedure, analysis. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want to see amazing experimental type design and typography, take a look at the work of the Didots and Bodoni.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If experiment were used simply in the sense of 'trial-and-error' in regard to type design and typography, I wouldn't mind so much. But the term seems to have been fairly frequently used to elevate what was, in fact, stylistic play by suggesting a scientific rigour that it didn't possess. Lewis Blackwell's books about David Carson are prime examples. The same sort of thing happens when the jargon of critical theory &ndash; itself an appropriation of scientific and pseudo-scientific terminology by way of social sciences &ndash; is applied to graphic design: its main purpose seems to be to make designers feel important. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We should never underestimate the vacuity of much of the design industry, and should be wary when it starts using impressive sounding words. Erik Spiekermann made this point at ATypI this year, relating how, having established a reputation as an information architect (another appropriated term), he began to receive requests for him to give things 'that information design look'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is a sense in which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> serious type design is experimental: it proceeds from an idea, through a process of testing and refinement, and generally reaches a significant resolution if not conclusion. But something tells me that when Brandon asks for examples of 'experimental typography' he is thinking of stuff that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> experimental, i.e. novel and unorthodox. One way to clarify this would be to ask what is counter to experimental typography: presumably that which is based on known results, i.e. prior experiment or discovery. Above, I mentioned the types and typography of the Didots and Bodoni as examples of experimental typography, and if we no longer think of a block of text on a relatively narrow width, with generous leading, set in a Didot or Bodoni type as 'experimental' it is because we have analysed and understood the results of that experiment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I say '<!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot of what<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is called &quot;social science&quot;' I mainly mean parts of sociology and psychology. Geography et al I have no problem with. Sorry for the confusion there. I am talking about a small subsection of that body of knowledge that seems to expend a disproportionate amount of the available funding. I don't know how familiar you are with American academia over the past ten years, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, but in my view (and for many others) lots of scholarship in these otherwise worthwhile subjects has been wasted on things like identity politics. I ran into this issue in pursuing my own degree (in German) and ended up having to make a rather painful decision not to go to grad school.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nothing personal, but I get really tired really quickly explaining the problem, because it's been covered so well elsewhere already, so please just consult the Sokal book I cited if you want to explore this more.
