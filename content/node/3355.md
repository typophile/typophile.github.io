  body: ' John, Flash does not support bitmap fonts, unfortunately. You have to use
    lo-fi outlines, tuned to specific PPEMs. <BR> <BR>Fontastic and FontStudio work,
    but are hard to find. There&#39;s a nice UNIX utility, called XBDF, I think. And
    I think I once saw some funky online utility for making bitmap fonts. But why
    not just use Fontographer? It can export MacOS suitcases &#40;do those still work?&#41;
    as well as  BDFs which can be embedded in Windows TT fonts using SBIT. <BR> <BR>hhp '
