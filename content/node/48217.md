body: "According to ancient kabballistic literature, both the very origin and shapes
  of the Hebrew language and alphabet are unique and have special significance.\r\n\r\nOrigin\r\n======\r\nWithout
  trying to sound chauvinistic, or holier-than-thou, Hebrew has its origin not like
  all other human languages, which are men-made, Hebrew is made in Heaven. Hence,
  it has divine aspects, higher than human intellect.\r\n\r\nWe see, simply then,
  that there may be things about Hebrew which are difficult to understand, but with
  much effort we can have a better insight into those things. \r\n\r\nDesign\r\n======\r\nHebrew
  letter forms are attributed with many special truths or explanations, which reflect
  both their particular shape, their very meaning (of that letters particular name),
  their 'gematria' or numerical equivalent, and grammatical significance.\r\n\r\nFOR
  EXAMPLE, one observation of the fact that Hebrew's origin is celestial is its direction
  from right-to-left. Actually, Hebrew is from left-to-right in its celestial source.
  This is known from the Medrash, a collection of books featuring various explanations
  of Biblical topics, phrases, episodes, and events. G-d showed a person a little
  of life above. The person noticed that writing of Hebrew below is a reflection of
  how it's done above. So, the opposite or reflection of left-to-right is a reflection
  of right-to-left.\r\n\r\nThere are two other strong indicators that the origin of
  Hebrew is not simply a man-made creation, but spiritual.\r\n\r\nFirst, sacred Hebrew
  text, like the text of the Bible in Hebrew contains an unusually high percentage
  of \"meaning-patterns\" because of the Divinely inspired nature of the very text.
  The arrangement of its letters not only contain a surface meaning when we read the
  text at face value. \r\n\r\nThis special arrangement contain hidden meanings too.
  Books have written based on serious research discovering that this text has meanings
  layered beneath the face value of the words. If a certain number value is applied
  in a pattern between the words, like every 50 letters, then a name or word perhaps
  is spelled out in these increments of 50 letters. Then, we look at the subject of
  the text, where the name or word appears very most frequently, and we find that
  the topic reflects the name or word.\r\n\r\nSimilar studies were performed in other
  large texts in other language, such as Shakespeare, the telephone book, or Encyclopedia
  Britanica. However, no such patter could appear appear in a way which was a statistical
  impossibility. This indicates that not only is the text of the Hebrew Bible pre-arranged
  to include special messages, but the very letters can be used in this super-human
  manner.\r\n\r\nSecond, there is a computer-language-like quality to Hebrew, where
  the language is structured according to very fine and tight rules of logic, higher
  than human reasoning.\r\nFor example. Hebrew words are derived from two letter root
  sources, which are either doubled into a pattern of four letters, or into three
  letters (with a third letter added to the two letters preceding it). The meaning
  of the word is related to this two letter root source, with the meaning modified
  by the second letter, and further modified by the third letter. Verbs are simply
  these root sources arranged in one of seven manners. The same with adjectives and
  nouns. The whole system defies our thinking in that it is too perfect and logical.
  We understand it, we appreciate it, but we see that we would be foolish to attribute
  it to human intelligence."

  body: "The Shape and Design of the First Hebrew Letter: Aleph\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThe
    first letter of the Hebrew alphabet is the letter \"Aleph\".\r\n\r\nAleph is shaped,
    according to kabballistic literature as a combination of two other letters, the
    vov and the yuhd. \r\n\r\nVov is a tall narrow letter. In forming the aleph, the
    vov is tilted over, slanying with the top of it closer to the left, and the bottom
    of it at the baseline further to the right. There is an appriximate 60 degree
    angle.\r\n\r\nYuhd is a small fascinating letter, with much of its own significance,
    to be discussed later. In forming the aleph, two duplicates of yuhd are attached
    to the tilted vov. One yuhd is attached at the top right-hand side, rotated clockwise
    to attach to the upper third of the right-hand side of the vov. The other yuhd
    is attached at the lower left-hand side. The lower yuhd is almost upside-down,
    but corresponding to the angle of the upper yuhd. \r\n\r\nSignificance of This
    Shape\r\n==========================\r\nVov symbolized a connection and relationship
    of the above, the spiritual realm of the heavens, and the below, the material
    reality in which we dwell. Vov is also representative of \"him-shach-chah\", \"drawing
    down\", from above to below, or \"ha-al-lah\", \"lifting up\", from below to above.\r\n\r\nParenthetically,
    vov is actually composed of a yuhd, with an extension from the upper body to the
    baseline. Actually, all Hebrew letters, relates Kabballistic literature, are  derived
    from the yuhd.\r\n\r\nThe two yuhds (two parts of the 'yid') symbolize the two
    halves of every person. Each person has a heavenly part connected to an earthly
    part. The goal of the lower earthy part of the person is to draw down and become
    influenced by the lofty heavenly part (, and as a result become elevated and lift
    up their being to the heights of the spiritual part).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning of
    Creation\r\n=====================\r\nRhe Medrash (a collection of books featuring
    various explanations of Biblical topics, phrases, episodes, and events) relates
    that G-d sought a justification for beginning the text of the Hebrew Bible with
    a certain letter (as we said earlier about the uniqueness of Hebrew which the
    meaning of every word is most influenced by its first letter). G-d asked then
    each Hebrew letter to present its case, starting with end of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nEach
    letter tried and failed to present a winning argument. It cited complimentary
    words that began with that letter. But in counter-argument, a negative word was
    also sighted. This continued for each letter.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was beis' turn,
    the second letter of the alphabet. He argued that he should be chosen, because
    the word, \"boruch\", \"blessed\", bergins with a beis. And living a life is a
    blessing like creation itself. Well, it was a convincing argument.\r\n\r\nPoor
    aleph didn't even have a chance to plead its case. G-d noticed how dejected aleph
    looked, and consoled him. \"Don't fret, Aleph,\" said G-d, \"you'll start the
    Ten Commandments.\" With hearing that, aleph was happy agasin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    Solid Stance of Aleph Shows Truth\r\n=====================================\r\nThe
    shape of each Hebrew letter is either sturdy and strong, or unbalanced and weak,
    from a physics standpoint. When a Hebrew letter is shaped sturdy and strong, this
    is called \"emet\", or \"truthful\". Similarly, when a Hebrew letter is shaped
    unbalanced and weak, this is considered \"sheker\", or \"falsehood\".\r\n\r\nThe
    aleph stands up in a balanced manner, sturdy and strong. It is considered a true
    letter, and even begins the Hebrew word for truth, \"emet\"."

    stuff in the Torah was created in twilight before Sabbath of the first week of
    creation. This includes writing, the stylus, and the actual inscribed Decalogue
    on rock, siting there since creation for Moses to find. This idea is an effort
    to solve the problem that the Rabbinic Sages accepted the Greek idea of the Cosmos,
    or nature according to orderly law. Thus they were uncomfortable with miracles
    that went against the laws of nature. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I find it a charming
    and clever solution, but quite unconvincing. In any case what engraved that was
    engraved on the sacred tablets is unlikely to have been the Aramaic script that
    Judaism adopted after the Babylonian exile--as the sages themselves recognize.
    Thus I find it a stretch to ascribe, even by Mishnaic standards, sacred status
    to the shapes of the current Hebrew alphabet, derived from the Aramaic rather
    than even the ancient Hebrew one. And Moses and the Israelites may well have been
    using another dialect.  \r\n\r\nOf course, if you go to mystical ideas, you can
    get anything--or not. I find the Hebrew aleph-bet rather magical, but also the
    Roman alphabet, which is derived from the capitals of the hated Romans. All scripts
    in long use have something mysterious and charming about them, in my view. "

    Just few questions, I would be thankful if answered in short:\r\n> 1. Is Divine/Heaven
    left or right-handed?\r\n\r\nKabballistic literature states clearly that \"ain
    smol lemaylah - no left exist above\".\r\n\r\nPolarity is based inly in our reality.
    In the heavenly realm, there is only right (sic).\r\n\r\n> Rotates Clockwise or
    CounterClockwise?!\r\n\r\nDirection again assumes dimensions. Heaven is beyond
    dimension, as dimension was created by Him, like time and space.\r\n\r\n> 2. Did
    Divine/Heaven create One or more writing Systems?!\r\n\r\nOur literature inly
    speaks of Hebrew. Plus super-human qualities found in Hebrew don't exist in other
    language systems.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, both the Iranians, and the CIA, have invested
    serious resources to mastering Hebrew and the Talmud in particular, to derive
    the secret powers of the Israeli. Since this includes mastering Talmud, clearly
    the aim is not to merely fathom the language of the Israelis.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    is it any wonder that the Israelis lead the technology race, even in front of
    the USA, as their mode of thinking is in Hebrew. For example their latest technology
    is to remotely disable an anti-missile system, rendering any country in effect
    defenseless of counter attack. I think that this is the ultimate weapon of deterrence.\r\n"

    but this angelic force is described as actually seeking good, and simply tests

    the modern-day Hebrew letter forms do not hold the same significance as drawings
    which were found inscribed in stones, which we attribute to early versions of
    Hebrew script (or derived from Phoenician script, as it appears from a design
    viewpoint). If so, since these Hebrew designs are not similar, certainly then
    Moses and the Israelites were using another dialect that we know as Hebrew.\r\n\r\nI
    disagree with this, though like much of which you presented, they make good tales.\r\n\r\nThe
    ancient Dead Sea Scrolls contain hand-scribed Hebrew letter forms very much resembling
    those of modern Hebrew letter forms. \r\n\r\nThe Phoenician-like truncated set
    of Hebrew letter-forms found from stone engravings indicate two things: a) the
    letters are a limited set, closer to the language used by the Phienicians, and
    b) the designs do not contain curve-like attributes, and designs most conducive
    to enraving in stone. Hence, they are not indicative of what Jewish people have
    commonly used as ink on parchment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Talmud relates that
    a special Hebrew letter form was reserved for holy scripts, like in a Torah scroll,
    tefillin rolls, or a mezuzah parchment (used to this very day).\r\n\r\nOur understanding
    of the shape and design style of the modern-day Hebrew letter forms are actually
    not very modern-day at all. Many of the block or square letter forms were thought
    by most secular scholars to be related to the advent of the printing press over
    500 years ago. They were unaware that drawings of hand-scribed Hebrew books featuring
    block or square letter forms existed prior to the invention of the printing press.
    \r\n\r\nIn fact, these thick square letter designs resembled very old drawings
    of Sephardic origin. Other ancient drawings, similar to the famous Koren type
    design, created by the late seventies Israeli type designer, Eliyahu Koren. (This
    is similar to the popular designs of the late Israeli type designer, Tzvi Narkiss,
    which stringly resemble the hand-drawn posters created in the Warsaw Ghetto of
    sans serif font designs - something which was not thought to have existed for
    Hebrew in the forties.)\r\n\r\nSo, clearly we see that \"new\" Hebrew designs
    appear to have been created recently, but in truth are derived from similar drawings
    of Hebre letter forms from very earlier periods, and perhaps back even to the
    times of the Bible. This brings into serious question of the historical validity
    of the ancient letter forms engraved in stone. Perhaps, they are a derivative
    of the Phoenician script which they resemble?"

    that the mystery schools used folk maps of the CNS, and that the real application
    had to do with combining various branches of what we now call psychology with
    initiation to create more fully functioning people. For example, through the study
    of various archetypes and through initiation the aspirant learns to become all
    possible minds within the collective human mind and to move with purpose from
    state to state. This tends to over-write the base level personality and give tools
    to get around certain limitations that nature and nurture impose. The convoluted
    nature of the system keeps the knowledge secret to anyone that is not properly
    instructed and initiated, as the practitioners and keepers tend to believe strongly
    that they have increased their powers of influence and want to keep these powers
    concentrated with those that are trusted.\r\n\r\nThe encoded geometry, in my mind,
    is very similar to other methods that are designed to exhaust the mind and eventually
    create a receptive state for the actual experience of learning how the mind can
    direct the electro-chemical activities in the physical body.\r\n\r\nQ: Would the

    have to do with the design or use of Hebrew letters.\r\n\r\nThe discussion is
    around the topic of the shapes and the design of Hebrew letters. \r\n\r\nSo far,
    we've basically two types of examples: \r\n\r\na) the first regarding the letter
    aleph, and how it is formed from three elements, two letters of the yuhd and one
    other letter the vov.\r\n\r\nb) the second regarding the difference between the
    chet and the hei: the chet only having one opening, symbolizing limited acceptance
    of G-d, and the hei having multiple openings, symbolizing great flexibility and
    a willingness to accept G-d.\r\n\r\nI think the fact the design of Hebrew letter
    forms is the subject of analysis clearly shows us that this is significant, to
    better understand how to correctly form and use Hebrew letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also
    the midrash about matzah and chometz to me seems a little silly. I\u2019m all
    in favor of being open minded and not arrogant, but it has nothing to do with
    eating with bread. After all, we eat bread the other 51 weeks, so should be we
    arrogant except on Pesach?\r\n\r\nYou raise a good question. I recall that in
    yeshiva, this question was raised also.\r\n\r\nThe act of eating fluffy bread
    or flat bread is not the issue. Arrogance and humility result from how we relate
    towards others, and the manner of importance we reserve for ourselves.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    our Jewish sages apply to the act of Jewish people not eating bread on Passover,
    and eating only matzah, this meaning and symbolism. Kabbalistic yeachings add
    another dimension.\r\n\r\nWhen we eat only matzah and rid ourselves of chometz
    during the eight days of Passover, this accumulated \"bittul\" lasts all year
    around, enabling us to eat chometz (the symbol of arrogance) during the rest of
    the year, and not be affected by it.\r\n\r\nDoes this answer your concern?"

    Devil concept. It is a Christian concept which has become incorporated into the
    western mind and culture. I believe Christianity wrapped this popular notion because
    the masses related to it well. I believe it originate from an ancient Persian
    religion.\r\n\r\nJudaism's concept good-seeking angelic force which test people
    to bring out their potential is not a creative force, be it a script, a language,
    a recipe, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to explain in detail the concept of Hebrew,
    but since though and souls exist above the creation of angels, the creation of
    Hebrew is likely also before the creation of angels, as thought requires language.\r\n\r\nDoes

    do you interpret these?\r\n\r\nThey are two distinct things.\r\n\r\nThe \"lifting
    of sparks\" is a kabbalistic concept. Basically, the world which know fell down,
    like all the other worlds above ours (kabbalistic literature describes our physical
    world the lowest one, of three other non-physical worlds above it), causing \"holy
    vessels\" to be shattered. Hence, there are sparks or pieces of these broken vessels
    which need to be raised, so they ascend back to the place from whence they came.
    When we do \"mitzvahs\", various good acts, we cause these sparks to be raised.
    As a result, the ordinary physical objects we use are transformed into sacred
    objects.\r\n\r\nA lighting of a lamp is to illuminate the darkness. When this
    lighting is done for a sacred purpose, like to light the Sabbath candles, or to
    kindle the Chanukah lights, then those ordinary physical objects are transformed
    into sacred objects.\r\n\r\nI hope that this is clear.\r\n\r\nEven though the
    Hebrew letters illuminate and contain sparks, I don't think these discussions
    can be considered about the meaning of the shapes and design of the Hebrew letters."

    but the Creator is greater. Regardless of how you feel, I hardly think it necessary
    to view Hebrew as a primitive in God's creation; after all, He excels in taking
    what man has made and using it to work His divine plan. God's Word doesn't need
    to be limited by human language, which is so provably fallible and mutable (I

    adhered to by all Jews, including Orthodox Jews. I am not Orthodox, but you can
    be Orthodox and reject Jewish mysticism, and also the distinctive doctrines of
    Chassidic Judaism. \r\n\r\nIsrael here is portraying one variety of Judaism, which
    is genuine and authentic, but in fact most Jews do not agree with it.\r\n\r\nJT,
    putting the Devil equal to God is indeed a heresy in Christianity, the Manichean
    heresy. But it remains true that in Christianity the Devil is a personal, active
    force in the world opposing God. And this is quite different from Judaism, which
    sees good and bad tendencies within every individual, but does not see them as
    centrally directed and supported by a supernatural figure who opposes God. I haven't
    read it, but I believe that Elaine Pagel's book [[http://www.amazon.com/Origin-Satan-Christians-Demonized-Heretics/dp/0679731180/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1218556853&sr=8-2|Satan]]
    goes into depth on the history.\r\n\r\nAlso if you want to take offense at rejection
    of Christian views, you are going to be offended a lot if you talk to non-Christians.
    Christianity has the most adherents of any religion, but it remains true that
    most people in the world know about Christianity and reject it for what they think

    William you are clearly have a broad base of knowledge, but I beg to very firmly
    disagree with you.\r\n\r\nThe most basic belief of Judaism is in the absolute
    unity of G-d with one Torah, one People, and one Land.\r\n\r\nThis means that
    the teachings of the Torah (not the Torah scroll, but the entire body of Torah
    knowledge) can not be divided into: \"this part I fathom, I accept\", and the
    esoteric part \"this part I can not fathom, I reject\".\r\n\r\nNo Orthodox Jew,
    or even an intelligent less-observant Jew, can reject Jewish mysticism. The Vilna
    Gaon is universally accepted leader of non-Chassidic Orthodox Jewry. He himself
    was a great kabbalist. He rules for all generations that one could not be a rabbi
    who rules on matters of halacha without having a thoriygh understanding of the
    kabbalistic implications of his rulings. If non-Chassidic Jews rejected Jewish
    mysticism, then there would be no way to fulfill the Vilna Gaon's ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n>
    and also the distinctive doctrines of Chassidic Judaism.\r\n\r\nAll Chassidic
    sects follow the teachings of Jewish mysticism, known as Chassidus, or in particular
    Chabad Chassidus.\r\n\r\nThe Chassidus developed in depth by the Lubavitcher Rebbes
    are not on a plane by themselves, subject to be accepted or rejected, like flavors
    of ice cream.\r\n\r\nFor example, among the Satmar branch of Chassidism, Chabad
    Chassidus is regularly studies. The Kausenberger Rebbes, like most other Chassidic
    leaders, learn it too, though not as in depth as the Satmar Chassidim. I can cite
    many examples.\r\n\r\nAmong non-Orthodox or non-observant Jews, there is a very
    high rate (99.9%) lacking in background in knowing well Torah observances and
    lifestyles.\r\n\r\nI think that this is why Chabad Houses have had unbelievable
    success in reaching out to many non-Orthodox or non-observant Jews, and even to
    non-Jews, and after calmly and presenting Judaism is a positive limelight, the
    response is not rejection, but acceptance. All people relate to kindness, good
    deeds, morality, and decency. (Chabad's secret formula for success.)"

    And original sin has nothing to do with sex unless you're Constantine. But we're
    off that subject, so let's get back to letterforms.\r\n\r\nIt's actually pretty
    easy to trace the lineage from pictoral-initial systems like hieroglyphics to
    the Hebrew characters. The general idea is that, as an outgrowth of ideographic/logographic
    systems, characters came to stand for the initial sound of the words they depicted.
    Aleph, for instance, and not to pick on this thread, is believed to come from
    a depiction of an ox: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph\r\nOf course, the exact
    histories are obscure and uncertain, but historical records give linguists good
    clues as to the origin of writing systems where the language is known. \r\n\r\nThis
    goes back to my point about God being greater than physical limitations; if He
    wants to put special meaning behind writing, He'll work it out. There's nowhere
    in Scripture where God teaches Moses the aleph-bet for writing the Torah; it's
    the message that counts. That's what makes hidden meanings all the more miraculous.\r\n\r\nOn
    another note, gohebrew, you said the following:\r\n\"Sound is related to the meaning
    of the shapes of Hebrew letters, as discussed in Jewish mystical literature. The
    shape and movement of the mouth is the basis for particular shapes and sounds
    of Hebrew letters. Does this exist is other languages as well?\"\r\n\r\nYes, it
    is known to happen, although I don't really think Hebrew falls into this category.
    Writing systems where letterforms are based on phonetics are called featural codes.
    The prime example here is the Korean writing system, Hangeul (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangeul).
    Each character that represents a sound does so based on phonetic criteria, or
    so they say.\r\n\r\nOf course, this story is contested as well, but that's another
    story. In any case, Hangeul is hardly Hebrew.\r\n\r\nBy the way, have you read
    about the possibility that the numerical values of Hebrew letters given for a
    description of a vessel (For us, it's I Kings 7:24) shows that the ancient Israelites
    actually had a very close approximation of the value of pi, the ratio of a circle's
    diameter to it's circumference? I find that incredibly cool.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    tradition (I guess that its recorded then in the Midrash), Moses transcribed the
    orally-given instructions of the Torah in thirteen copies of scrolls, given to
    each tribe, and one copy was preserved in the portable ark.\r\n\r\nThe entire
    Torah existed only in the form of oral discussions. Many of them existed before
    the times of Mt. Sinai, among the Levites and the scholars of the various tribes.
    Josepf for example studied these oral discussions with his father, Jacob. Similarly,
    even earlier, Isaac went to study in the Shem and Aver's school. Likewise, certain
    kabbalistic-like teachings were given in book-like form to Abraham from an angel.
    Even much earlier, Adam was given a text in a book-like form from another angel.\r\n\r\nMany
    generations later, much od this was transcribed first in the Mishnah, and later
    in the Talmud and other post Talmudic hand-written books, as detailed by Maimonides.
    Kabbalistic literature was first transcribed in the the very unclear Zohar, but

    account in the old Jewish Encyclopedia]], the pen-written Aramaic script didn't
    exist until the fourth or fifth century BCE. Hence it couldn't have been used,
    with understanding, on the tablets that Moshe got at Mt. Sinai.\r\n\r\nFurther,
    the article cites the fact that the Talmud itself (San. 21a) ascribes the introduction
    of the Aramaic (called Ashurit, Assyrian) script for writing the Torah to Ezra,
    seven or eight hundred years after Moshe. Hence it is very unlikely that the quotation
    from Avot 5 that I mentioned earlier, which says that God created 'the script,
    the stylus, the tablets' was referring specifically to the square script you are
    discussing. The Sages were quite aware that the original Hebrew script was quite
    different from the then-used square script, which we still use today. \r\n\r\nIn
    addition you say that the Kabbalistic sources are \"ancient\". But according to
    the Encyclopedia Judaica, scholarly opinion is pretty much unanimous that the
    Zohar, at least, was written in the middle ages, in the 13th century, and only
    pseudonymously ascribed to Shimon bar Yochai of the first century. And Isaac Luria,
    the great Kabbalist whom you refer to,  lived in the 16th century. \r\n\r\nYour
    views here thus seem to be contradicted by both the Talmud and modern scholarship.
    \r\n\r\nNow you are of course perfectly entitled to accept Kabbalist explanations,
    and say that Moses de Leon, thought to be an author of the Zohar, was channeling
    Shimon bar Yochai or whatever. But I am surprised that you think people here will
    simply accept these views of Hebrew script without discussing alternative views.
    If you want to convince us,  you will need to address the historical record. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    I must say your dreadful anti-feminist story doesn't help your case. \r\n\r\nHowever,

    likely have two dates of origin.\r\n\r\nThere are ideas and concepts of a certain
    account, teaching, or belief that preceded their transcription, which occurred
    many decades or centuries later.\r\n\r\nWhen I refer to kabbalistic though, I
    refer not to the Zohar. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Rabbi Judah the Prince is attributed
    to transcribing the Mishnah. This was first main attempt to transcribe many teachings
    of the Oral Law. Nobody suggests that the ideas and concepts recorded in the Mishnah
    are original. Nobody suggests that the ideas and concepts recorded in the Mishnah
    did not exist prior to this composition.\r\n\r\nJewish tradition suggests that
    the Oral Law existed at the time the Torah (the Written Law) was transmitted by
    G-d to Moses, as I mentioned earlier regarding Joseph reminding his father Jacob
    that he didn't forget the last lesson they learned together, and symbolized this
    by sending the specific gifts prior to their meeting.\r\n\r\nActually, the Oral
    Law existed even before this, as the Fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Shalom DovBer
    of Lubavitch, explains in his pamphlet \"Kuntres Eitz Chayim\" (recently translated
    in English by Kehot Publication Society www.kehotonline.com) that the Mishnah
    in a condensed version of older version of the Talmud (the names were obviously
    different, but the discussion are the same). The older Talmud is a oral explanation
    of an older Mishnah, a collection of laws about what to do in specific situations.\r\n\r\nEventhough
    Kumran was much later than this (the old Mishnah and old Talmud), among the Dead
    Sea Scrolls were found a somewhat different composition of practical laws, mimicking
    many of the decisions presented in the Mishnah and Talmud.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am
    a Chassidic Jew and obviously Orthodox, I grew up with a Reform background. \r\n\r\nMany
    (not all) educated Reform Jews are narrow-minded, and refuse to learn a different

    (San. 21a) ascribes the introduction of the Aramaic (called Ashurit, Assyrian)
    script for writing the Torah to Ezra, seven or eight hundred years after Moshe.
    \r\n\r\nThere is a difference of opinion what \"Ashurit\" refers to. It is not
    clear that block script is Ashurit. At that time, the composition of a Torah Scroll
    could be done in a form of Ancient Greek as well.\r\n\r\n> Hence it is very unlikely
    that the quotation from Avot 5 that I mentioned earlier, which says that God created
    \u2019the script, the stylus, the tablets\u2019 \r\n\r\n\"the script\" refers
    to the Hebrew transcribed by Moses on the second set of Tablets;\r\n\"the stylus\"
    refers to the egraving by G-d Himself in the first Tablets;\r\n\"the tablets\"
    refers to the very Tablets themselves.\r\n\r\n> was referring specifically to
    the square script you are discussing. \r\n\r\nI am unsure of this. I don't think
    if we date their being used much later, preclides them being used now. Until we
    are forced to conclude thusly, we can logically presume that this square script
    was used before hand.\r\n\r\n> The Sages were quite aware that the original Hebrew
    script was quite different from the then-used square script, which we still use
    today.\r\n\r\nThere is a discussion that a certain script for everyday use, and
    another script was reserved for sacred texts. You say that the square script was
    used for everyday use.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, the sacred script was that which we use
    today in our Torah Scrolls.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this view, is that mosy
    kabbalistic analysis that I've seen presents the traditional square script.\r\n\r\nRabbi
    Yitchok Ginsburgh of the Gal Einai Institute (www.inner.org) has a fascinating
    book on the kabbalistic significance of the Hebrew letters, called \"Hebrew Letters\".
    He portrays the Hebrew lettersusing the script we are familiar to see in the Torah
    Scroll.\r\n\r\nOthers do this as well in very recent books.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, these
    letter forms are in deed ancient, but were not used in books from earlier generations,
    because these letter forms are not supposed to made into a typeface and used for
    mundane or profane purposes, due to the holiness of the \"taggim\", the decorative
    symbols attached to the tops of certain Hebrew letters.\r\n\r\nThere is a great
    significance to these \"taggim\" symbols, that Moses cried when he saw Rabbi Akiva
    give a lesson about their significance, which he failed to comprehend. Only after
    G-d consoled him, that Rabbi Akiva derived these teachings from the Torah which
    Moses taught, did Moses stop crying."

    male and female forces to words is in deed a part of the Hebrew language. Here
    it is in a more down-to-earth sense, that certain words are masculine, and other
    words are feminine. In Jewish mysticism, this is more abstract. Concepts like
    Chochmah (Wisdom, or the initial stage of the thought process) is masculine, as
    men are more creative in their thinking; while Binah (Understanding, or the analytical
    stage of of the thought process) is feminine, as women are more pragmatic, seeing
    the practical implication of a matter.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, male and female aspects
    of creation play an important role in understanding its dynamics. For example,
    the flow of influence from G-d is manly, for obvious reasons, and the ability
    to receive and accept it is feminine - in the sexual sense.\r\n\r\nI believe I

  body: "Yaronimus Maximus,\r\n\r\nThese are indeed excellent questions.\r\n\r\nBe
    careful not to get too caught up in the question, and not being willing to look
    for an answer.\r\n\r\nThis is like those who look for truth, and then ignire it
    once they find it, because they enjoy too much the search. Getting back to your
    excellent questions... \r\n\r\nYou ask about the consistency between a Hebrew
    letter's openness, which seemingly indicates a greater flexibility and willingness
    to accept differences, and between a Hebrew letter's solidness, and ability to
    stand firm through diversity, an attribute of truthfulness.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    at times we need to be flexible, like the Hebrew saying in the Talmud, \"Teheh
    rach kekanah\", \"be soft or flexible like a reed\". This being flexible, open
    to challenges, is strength.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, at times we need to be firm
    in our ideals, like the Jewish people are described in the Bible, \"Am keshareph
    hu\", \"a stiff-necked people\" (this is intentionally taken out of context),
    which is like the ytait if truthfulness.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it from a simple
    design perspective, you can't have it both ways: both being open and airy, and
    solid and firm, for to be solid and firm as you pointed out implies not being
    open and airy.\r\n\r\nAbout the yuhd, you are right, but draw an incorrect conclusion.
    All the letters originate from yuhd, meaning their source in ruchniyut, spirituality,
    which is lofty, and ungrounded, like the yuhd, a point floating in the air.\r\n\r\nYour
    most compelling question regards the seeming contradictory status of the mehm.
    I think if we inspect the actual words of Chazal, our Jewish sages, they only
    point out that it is a middle letter, and not the middle letter. As your graphic
    clearly shows, mehm is a middle letter, if you divide all the letters into three
    parts.\r\n\r\nI think the overall lesson is that truth, like the Hebrew word \"Emet\",
    is true all the way through. It is consistent, and not with intervals of falsehood.
    Unlike the Hebrew word \"Sheker\", the order is backwords (shin to reish) and
    inconsistent (with kuf in the middle, that normally should come before reish in
    correct order, or after reish in backwards order).\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense
    to you now?"

    that you do not see the aspect of male/female polarities in the spiritual and
    physical world, because your mind is simply notattuned to this way of thinking.\r\n\r\nThe
    Talmud relates that there was a certain sage from Babylonia who realized that
    in order for him to succeed in his studies in Israel, where the manner of study
    was very different than he was accustomed to in Babylonia, he would have to fast
    a long time and forget how he studied in Babylonia. Afterwards, he succeeded in
    his studies in Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI are not attempting to \"hang genitals on ideas
    that are universal\" or to suggest that \"clouds was male or female\" (rain is
    generally considered male-like, and earth which is watered is female-like).\r\n\r\nIt's
    just a different way of looking at things, like learning in Babylonia versus learning
    in Israel, or men being from Mars are different than women who come from Venus.
    Different.\r\n\r\nIt's not a value statement, just a fact of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout
    the men who are passive like some women, and women who are macho like some men,
    I think that by citing the exceptions to the norm, just shows us how topsy-turvy
    much of life is today, where some men act as women, and some women act as men."

    Lakish said: ...Why are the letters of 'sheker' close together, while, those of
    'emet' far apart? Falsehood is frequent, and truth is rare. And why does falsehood

    a Medrash's teaching, quoted by the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yabbi Yosef Yitchok
    (Joseph Isaac) in a famous discourse released for study for the day of his demise.
    It ststes that certain letters are unstable, having a weak foundation. Although
    we do find words that include them which are good, many words which represent
    very bad things include them, and even begin with them.\r\n\r\nHence, according
    to this teaching from the Medrash, it's ok for words like kodesh to be made of
    'bad' letters.\r\n\r\nWe see then that this dispute is over a moot point."

    and not base thoughts, when behaving in a human way, and not an animal-like way,
    then the sexual union is complete and whole, and includes all the letters of the
    couple's names.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the Medrash relates an episode about Abrahan

    Rabbi Akiva, who had very humble beginnings, if you know the inspiring story of
    the hole in the rock, or how his wife Rachel saw his great potential even before
    she married him and was subsequently disowned. We see his super-greatness in how
    a mistake Rabbi Akiva made is viewed by another very great rabbi, Maimonides.
    A mistake! The latter writes that Rabbi Akiva erred about Bar Koziba or Bar Kochba,
    ruling he was the long awaited messiah. Only after this famous general was killed,
    Rabbi Akiva realized that he erred. Killed, not died. Hence, Maimonides concludes
    that being killed (not dying) is a disqualification to be considered the messiah.)\r\n\r\nI
    reason, when this occurs from different sources etc., it is likely a valid and

    of yours and rejection of flexible thinking, as a justification to exit the dialogue.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to my limited thinking, this demonstrates (please, don't be offended) small mindedness.\r\n\r\nIn
    a famous long discourse, called \"Ayin-beis\", the Rebbe Reshab praises a broad-minded
    person as being able to be flexible in his or her thinking, and able to consider
    the pros and cons of two opposing viewpoints. He says that most people can not
    do this. They can not tolerate two opoposite thoughts in their mind. \r\n\r\nI
    call this small mindedness.\r\n\r\nIn Lott's locale of evil folks, anal sex was
    the norm, between couples, between men, between men and animals; like murder,
    amputation, mistreatment of guests, and corruption, these evil people were not
    satisfied unless they were satiated with doing evil deeds.\r\n\r\nIt's hard for
    us to conceive of people so bad. If you saw \"Shindler's List\" and specifically
    the scene of the random murder by the Nazi's machine gum, followed by casual sex,
    then you can begin to imagine how bad the people of Sedom were.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    if Lott offerred himself to the crowd for self-sacrificial anal sex, I don't think
    that he woiuld have appeased the angry crowd. He figured that his daughters (who

    the evil behavior of Sedom and \"wash the salt of Sedom and extreme selfishness

    most satisfied."

    Chassidic rabbi responded with an infectious smile. He said, \"We're very warm-blooded
    people. When we sit near an attractive woman, whether she's our wife, or just
    a friend, our thoughts run wild. So, to promote the sanctity of communal prayer,
    to concentrate upon our prayers and not upon women sitting near us, men sit apart
    from women.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the other non-Orthodox men and wmen must be like angels,
    or very cold-blooded with no passions, because they feel that they can sit besides
    each other, and still concentrate fully upon their prayers, and not upon each
    other. They must be saints! But we are ordinary people, with warm-blood, warm
    feelings and natural passions. So, we sit apart.\"\r\n\r\nHe convinced me."

    secular knowledge which is finite), so your gain is really relatively even smaller
    by comparision (Chassidic thought).\r\n\r\nI myself am a product of a Reform home,

    very much to gain knowledge, even though in Torah-true Judaism he knew very little.
    Maaseh hu haikar, emphasizes the Talmud. If you learn more, and know a lot, but
    do not practice, you know less than nothing, asserts the Talmud, tractate Taanit.\r\n\r\nUnlike
    Greek thought, or much corruption in the USA, the Torah demands us to practice
    what we preach, and not to invent justifications to avoid practice.\r\n\r\nI never
    asserted that Reform Jews were ignoramuses in the secular sense. I simply said
    that they know little or nothing about the actual day-to-day lifestyle of Chassidic
    Jews. I'll add that many of them believe false notions, and some sadly even contain
    unfortunate hatred.\r\n\r\nWith so many enemies who to eradicate or \"gas\" Jewry,
    called \"Israel\", Jews can't afford to hate each other.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have

    are two letters in the Hebrew alphabet, daled and reish, which are similar in
    both design and meaning.\r\n\r\nIn the visual examples reproduced at the bottom
    of this post, you can see how the two letters are similar in design.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    how do we see how these two letters are similar in meaning? In the following passage
    from the well-known discource known as \"Basi L'gani\", an explanation is presented
    about their similarity in meaning, too:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"...daled and reish are similar
    not only in their form but also in their meaning.\r\n\r\n\"The letter daled is
    related to the word 'daloot', which means \"poverty\".\r\n\r\n\"In the spiritual
    realms, it refers to the Sefirah of Malchus, \"that has nothing (d'les lah) of
    its own\" [i.e., it merely receives and transmits the downward flow of Divine
    beneficence].\r\n\r\n\"In the realm of the soul, this state [of poverty] is reflected
    in the power of speech, that merely receives and articulates [lit., \"enclothes\"]
    the spiritual faculties that are above it.\r\n\r\n\"For example, in the expression
    of intellect or emotion [speech contributes nothing].\r\n\r\n\"The letter reish
    is similarly related to the state of poverty, as is evident from the verse that
    says (Proverbs 10:15): \"The ruin of the poor is their poverty.\" Likewise, --
    \"[Give me neither] poverty nor riches.\" \"\r\n\r\n   -Basi L'Gani, ch. 6 (Sichos

    is an alef?\r\n\r\n... Every aspect of the alef's construction has been Divinely
    designed to teach us something. Contrast this with a child learning to read English
    for the first time. He is never taught why a capital \"A\" looks like a teepee
    and a small \"a\" looks like a soap bubble stuck to a wall.\r\n\r\nBut Hebrew
    is different. The design of an alef is actually made up of three different letters:
    the letter yud or dot above; a yud or dot below; and a diagonal vav, or line suspended
    in between.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe letter yud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yuhd_Torah_5216.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe
    letter vov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vov_Torah_3818.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    yud above represents G-d, Who is above (or beyond) our comprehension. In comparison
    to His true essence, our understanding is a mere dot.\r\n\r\nThe yud below represents
    a Yid or Yehudim-Jewish people who dwell here on earth. The only way that we can
    grasp G-d's wisdom-to the extent that a person is capable-is by being humble.
    When we realize that we are but a dot or a speck compared to the All-Mighty and
    All-Powerful G-d, we become a vessel to receive His Divine wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe
    diagonal vav represents a Jew's faith-which unites him with G-d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere
    is another teaching that posits that the suspended vav represents the Torah. Since
    the Torah is what unites a Jew and G-d, the alef represents this unity between
    mankind and G-d. This is the design, or form, of the alef.\r\n\r\nWe can see that
    every stroke of the alef (and every other letter as well) has a special purpose,
    and that there is much more to learning the alef-beis than just mastering its
    sounds."

    whether Abraham knew the true identity of his quests, as he served them both meat
    and dairy products, and watched them 'eat' under the tree to make sure they don't
    eat them together.\r\n\r\nSince Abraham knew that angels don't require food to
    survive, he must have thought they were ordinary bedoins. Or he was simply playing
    along with their ruse.\r\n\r\nRashi notes that there were three angels by Abraham,
    but only two remained by Lott, explaining each angel only has one task. The angel,
    whose task was to notify Abraham and Sarah of their having a child one year later,
    did not remain, as he fulfilled his mission. The other two angels were for healing,
    and for destruction.\r\n\r\nYour view then seems accurate, since Lott did not
    want to dishonor his special guests, and was even willing to offer his daughters
    to appease the crowd. This is very hard for us to understand, but in Lott's society
    anal sex was a norm, and treating guests was a special important act he learned
    from Abraham. In fact, the main evil of Lott's environment was the mistreatment
    of guests.\r\n\r\nIs 'pomegranite' an allusion to the Talmud's praise of the rimon,
    pomegranite? The Talmud compares even the simplest most unlearned Jew to a pomegranite.
    The pomegranite is packed full of seeds like even the simplest most unlearned
    Jew is packed fulled of merits and good deeds, mitvahs.\r\n\r\nEven if he or she
    knows very little about the 613 mitzvahs, or the details about the messiah, nevertheless
    G-d views him or her in a cherished way.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen throughout thousands
    of years of challenge, and even pain and death, at the hands of other religion's
    zealots, these simple Jews stay true to their faith, and reject other avodah-zarahs."

    has not.\r\n\r\nActually, Hebrew has no synonyms. \r\n\r\nDepending upon your
    definition of a synonym, words which have similar meanings, in Hebrew each word
    is unigue in meaning.\r\n\r\nAlthough the word in Hebrew for a man has four types:
    such as, adam, eesh, ehnosh etc. Each word is special, both in its etymology and
    its significance. \r\n\r\nAdam refers to his source, being created from adamah,
    earth, or aleph-dam, the mixture of a G-dly soul and blood, for a person is a
    combination of G-dly spirit and flesh & blood. The significance of this word in
    particular is to the intellect, as the term adam is in reference to man's loftiest
    state.\r\n\r\nEesh, on the other hand, refers to the emotions, and not to the
    intellect.\r\n\r\nSo, we see that even words which seem like synonyms are very
    different from each other.\r\n\r\nI think that this is due to the make up of all
    Hebrew word roots, where the first letter dominates its meaning, combined by the
    second letter which modifies it, and the third letter further pinpoints its meaning.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    since words with similar meanings are spelled differently, it follows that the
    deeper meaning of each word is different from another. Hence, there can be no
    synonyms."

    something and it keeps coming to mind, showing up in the oddest ways and you are
    so compelled to search it out?  That happened to me three years ago with the pomegranate.
    \ I hope you have time for this?\r\n\r\nI was unemployed and needed a job.  Having
    this new found free time on my hands I was creating patterns, and doing drawings
    that I made cards with.  One was of a pomegranate with the seeds spilling out.
    A friend of mine said I should go into business.  \r\n\r\nWhen I listen to people
    talk I usually visually picture what is being said.  I was at shul and our Rabbi
    was talking about G-d.  In his talk awesome messages were developing in my minds
    eye.  He was talking about the clouds when they are full and heavy and dark and
    very close to earth.  \r\n\r\nWell, it is like G-d is even closer to us at those
    times and it can be a very intimate time with HaShem, like we are being invited
    in to His chambers into the private rooms of His home.  (The chambers reminded
    me of the pomegranate again.)\r\n\r\nOur Rabbi also shared a dream where he was
    fishing and the fish were so large he was scared.  (He doesn\u2019t fish.)\r\n\r\nSo
    the things that stood out in my mind that day were: Water\u2026Heavy\u2026Big\u2026fish\u2026\u2026door\u2026.intimacy
    \u2026.room.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home \u2018pomegranate\u2019 would not leave my
    mind and had to find out more about the pomegranate and what it meant in a Hebraic
    way.\r\n\r\nFirst I found out how it was spelled in Hebrew:  Rimmon is what I
    came up with online.\r\n\r\nThen I needed to know what each of the letters meant:\r\nReysh
    \u2013 a person \u2013 the head \u2013 the highest \u2013 Literal meaning: Head
    of man\r\nMem \u2013 Liquid \u2013 massive \u2013 chaos \u2013 Literal meaning:
    Water  there are two mems\r\nNoon \u2013 Activity \u2013 life \u2013 Literal meaning:
    fish dart through the water\r\n\r\nI knew this finding was important and G-d was
    showing me something\u2026..I didn\u2019t know quite what but my heart had picked
    up the pace with anticipation and feeling near to HaShem.  I knew it also had
    to do with what the Rabbi had spoke of???\r\n\r\nSo with further study on line
    I found this:\r\n\r\n1.  The pomegranate is given the unique distinction of being
    closely linked to the House of G-d \u2013 not once, but twice. The first time
    is when the Tabernacle is set up under Moses\u2019 direction in the wilderness
    and secondly at the building of Solomon\u2019s Temple\r\n\r\nWhen Moses is given
    instructions in the wilderness on how to prepare the vestments of the High Priest,
    he is told to decorate them with pomegranates\r\n\r\nThen, later on, when Solomon
    builds the first and what most Bible scholars consider to be the most magnificent
    house of the L-RD ever, the pomegranate once again plays a significant role. The
    two main pillars at the entrance to G-d\u2019s house, which are named Yachin and
    Boaz, are heavily decorated with pomegranates.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, whenever His
    blessings are upon Israel, they are always manifested by fruitfulness and abundance.
    Our G-d is a G-d of ever expanding life and the pomegranate is the symbol He has
    chosen to represent this.\r\n\r\n2.  And in Song of Songs Rabbah (6:11) it is
    written, \"Children sitting in a row studying Torah are compared to the compact
    kernels of a pomegranate.\" Thus, the pomegranate seems like the perfect adornment
    for the hem of the High Priest's robe. It is as though the sound of the bells
    would be alerting the congregation to the blessings that the pomegranate signifies.
    \r\n\r\nSince the Middle Ages, this popular pomegranate design continues to be
    used for ornaments covering the staves on which the Torah scroll is rolled. Usually
    made of silver, these ornaments are called rimmonim or pomegranates, even when
    they have different designs, such as towers with bells. These silver rimmonim
    connote remembrance as well as mitzvoth, Torah, study, beauty, and fertility.
    \r\n\r\nWhy Frames?  Because they teach us to quest for what we need. Because
    they serve as a trigger for us to recall what is inside. The heart of the matter
    is that frames create borders that we must transform into open doors.\r\n\r\nFrames
    cause us to remember, just as the gold-framed stones of remembrance, upon which
    were engraved the names of the sons of Israel, link us to recall our continuity
    to the children of Israel, our ancestors, and with a sacred remembrance of our
    one G-d. So, too, the silver forms of the pomegranate on top of the Torah rollers
    serve as a memorial.\r\n\r\nTORAH!  I LOVE TORAH.  This is what G-d Himself, Bless
    His Holy Name, was showing me!  I was so excited.  It wasn\u2019t about me getting
    a business or anything it was about His Torah!\r\n\r\nSee our shul had been praying
    for a Torah for about four months\u2026\u2026we were very small and didn\u2019t
    have the funds to buy one.  BUT after reading about the pomegranate I KNEW we
    truly were going to get our Torah!  G-d was showing me.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what.
    \ Within one month we did get our Torah\u2026\u2026some people that did not go
    to our shul died (two of them) and somehow money was given to us because of them!\r\n\r\nBaruch
    HaShem!\r\n\r\nI will always love the pomegranate and when the opportunity came
    for me to really have my own business I had to have the pomegranate for a name.\r\n\r\nCrown
    is a play on words as this is what the pomegranate is for the Torah.  In my business
    I try to always point to G-d in wording and product.\r\n\r\nI hope you are still
    awake!?\u2026\u2026\u2026..;o)\r\n\r\nThank you for letting me share with you.

    three shins on top of the your name?\r\n\r\nIn general, the shin itself has three
    stems with a head on top of each one. Usually, they symbolize the first three
    fathers of the Jewish people, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In Jewish mystical literature,
    the three heads symbolize the initial three intellectual stages, called Hochmah,
    Binah, and Daat - conception (wisdom), analysis (understanding), and application
    (knowledge).]\r\n\r\nAs you read in my last post\u2026..sometimes things are important

    of the letter. I think though that, for lack of a better word, you are being ethnocentric.\r\n
    \r\nSadly most in the West are not interested in the genesis of the A or any other

    of the Latin Alphabet, I explain to them it is the contortions of the East/West
    \"ductus shift\" that brought the Latin A from a \"Phonecian oxen\" (aleph [a
    pictogram]) to a Latin phonogram. There is a reason for its shape, form and stance!
    As substantial and significant as yours.\r\n \r\nThere are those who maintain
    the Latin was divinely inspired. Cut away the bottom half of the Trajan caps and
    find any letter that is duplicated in its top form. O and Q maybe, but put them
    in word text and it is obvious which they are. Minute differences differentiate
    letterforms. Even now with the J incorporated it has a longer serif on the left

    tone of the post with your \"ethnocentric\" observation, but judging from your
    interest, your overall response, and profile (your quote in particular), you seem
    attracted to the notion that the shape of letters and their meanings are related
    to the ways they are used in words. This is an idea unique to Hebrew, as far as
    I know. \r\n \r\n \r\n> I've never heard the tee-pee or bubble junk. Is that something
    contrived by you? It is almost as if you are demeaning Latin forms to elevate
    your own.\r\n\r\nActually, I never heard them either before I read them from the
    book, \"Letters of Light\", by Rabbi Aaron Raskin, posted on the Internet at http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/letters-of-light/02.htm.\r\n
    \r\nStatements about the origins and outstanding significance of the Hebrew language
    and its letters appear to demean Latin and other forms just to elevate the status
    of Hebrew. This ia shallow observation, ignoring the greater perception to behold.\r\n
    \r\nThroughout history, animosity towards the Jewish people and our status as
    the \"Chosen People\" has been misconstrued for arrogance, condescendence, and
    an attempt to demean other peoples. \r\n\r\nThe Talmud even observes that \"hatred
    was created at Mt. Sinai\". This is a play on words between the Hebrew word for
    hatred, \"seen'nah\", and between the name of the mountain where the Torah teachings
    were given by G-d to the Jewish people, Sinai. \r\n\r\nThe basis of those teachings
    are that the role of the Jews is different than those of other peoples. The Jews
    are a \"chosen people\". Unlike the way that most people misconceive, the purpose
    of this title is not to degrade other non-Jewish people. Rather, the purpose is
    to emphasize the responsibility of Jewish people who were chosen to follow the
    613 directives or mitzvahs of the Torah. Other non-Jewish peoples must follow
    the seven Noahide laws.\r\n \r\nSo, too, here. By stating the Divine origins of
    the Hebrew language and significance of its letters, the listener can either focus
    his or her attention positively or negatively.\r\n \r\nSaying this is ethnocentric,
    arrogant, condescending, and demeaning, is negative. It misses the more important
    point.\r\n \r\nInstead, one should focus upon the ideas behind what's being said,
    and learn from them.\r\n \r\nRegarding the Aleph and A, the link to the form of
    the ox is a popular notion. Jewish tradition rejects this being the source for
    the Aleph. Instead, we learn that the Aleph like all other Hebrew letters is actually
    linked to the Yuhd, the tenth letter, as explain in that blog.\r\n \r\nIsrael\r\n"

    meaning: Head of man\r\n\r\nReysh is the name of the twentieth letter of the Hebrew
    alphabet. Its gematria or numerical equivalent is 200. There are 22 letters (chaf-beit
    ohti'yot), plus 4 final letter forms. There are also 4 more letters which have
    \"dotted\" forms, indicating a different pronounciation. In addition, the 21st
    letter has a left-dotted and right-dotted form.\r\n\r\nReysh also alludes to the
    Hebrew word for head, \"rosh\". The rosh or head is the highest part of the human
    body, housing the loftiest part, the brain.\r\n\r\nRosh is also used in Hebrew
    to describe the beginning of the year, known as the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana,
    the \"head of the year\" (literally).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, a great significance

    there are two mems\r\n\r\n(Questions: how is mem related to massive and chaos?)\r\n\r\nThis
    is a novel interpretation of the Hebrew letter, mem, the thirteenth letter of
    the Hebrew alphabet. Its gematria or numerical equivalent is 40. \r\n\r\nMem is
    suggestive of the Hebrew word for water, mayim, for the name of this letter, mem,
    has two letters, just like mayim. \r\n\r\nThis also alludes to the two kinds of
    water which existing when the world was created, as described briefly in the book
    of Genesis. \r\n\r\nWhen the 'fimament' was created in the sky, the waters were
    separated into two parts, the upper waters above the firmament, and the lower
    waters below the firmament. Therefore, the word in Hebrew for waters, mayim, has
    two mems.\r\n\r\nMuch is discussed in Jewish mystical writings about this topic
    of the significance of the two mems and the relationship between the upper and
    lower waters.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was only a single body of water, for the waters
    were separated later by the creation and placement in the sky of the fimament
    (whatever that is). As a result, the lower waters cried many tears after becoming
    apart from the upper waters.\r\n\r\nOur ancient Jewish sages explain this is an
    analogy of a huband and a wife. They were originally a single entity, and later
    separated into two different bodies. Then, at the time of their wedding, they
    are reunited admidst great happiness, celebration, and dancing. So, too, this
    reoccurs each time during intimacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mehms_5557.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThree

    book that proposed to reveal the mystic significance of the English alphabet.\r\n\r\nNote
    that not all the cultures who ascribed divine origin to writing did so unambivalently.
    The ancient Egyptians believed writing was an invention of the ibis-headed god
    Thoth, who is always depicted as a scribe. When he presented his invention as
    a gift to King Thutmose, the ruler responded that writing would encourage people
    to be forgetful because they would write stuff down instead of exercising their
    memories. Socrates relates this story in Plato's <em>Phaedrus,</em> in which he
    goes on to liken the carefully prepared speeches of the Sophists to written texts

  body: "Hi John,\r\n\r\nFunny meeting you here... :)\r\n\r\n> a great many peoples
    have ascribed divine origins to their writing systems\r\n\r\nIt is not logical
    to conclude that since this claim is untruthful elsewhere, it must also be untruthful
    here.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate my point with the following episode, as a logical
    proof to my argument, and even more.\r\n\r\nThe Roman elite enjoyed engaging the
    wise Jewish sages, relates the Talmud, in dialogues to prove their points of view.
    \r\n\r\nLater, the early Catholic priests, write the early redactors of Jewish
    law, known as the Rishonim, that Christianity must be the true religion, and Judaism
    should be rejected, because most human beings accept the teachings of Jesus, and
    relatively very few accept the teachings of Torah.\r\n\r\nThey argued that even
    the Torah concludes that the majority rules. Hence, the teachings of Jesus are
    true, and the teachings of Torah are false.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you argue (or 'chuckle')
    that Hebrew can not have divine orgins, because many other scripts claimed divinity
    and were proven non-holy. Hence, Hebrew too can not be holy. After all, majority
    rules.\r\n\r\nThe Rishonim answered this simply. See the sun, moon, and sky. They
    are in the heavens. If you, and most of the people in the world claim that the
    sun, moon, and sky, are not in the heavens; they are on the earth below, then
    the Torah concludes the majority doesn't rule. Because I see the truth.\r\n\r\nSo,
    too, a little over 3,200 years ago, we Jews saw G-d give us the teachings of Torah.
    We heard thunderous His voice. It was an experience that we relive every year.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nOnce,
    Maimonides was asked how he could know for certain that G-d created the world.
    The person asked, and left the return, only to return in a short time.\r\n\r\nIn
    the meanwhile, Maimonides took a nearby quill, ink well, and piece of parchment,
    and drew a beatiful scene. He then tipped the ink well on its side, and placed
    the quill beside it. The person returned.\r\n\r\nThe person asked: \"Who made
    the beautiful picture? Was it you?\"\r\n\r\nMaimonides answered, \"Oh, the ink-well
    must have fell over, and created it by accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said the
    peson, \"things don't happen by chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, hah,\" exclaimed Maimonides.
    \"So, too, it is with this beautiful world that we live in. It wasn't created
    by chance.\"\r\n\r\nI believe,\" answered Maimonides, \"that G-d created the world,
    and its creation did not happen by chance.\"\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe same thing
    here, John. It is G-d, creator of heaven and earth, who gives us the teachings
    of Torah each year, it is He that taught us Hebrew. Not some ox, golden cow, or
    descendants of apes... :)\r\n"

    recent invention.\r\n\r\nThe act of voting, and electing leadership by votings

  body: "This argument is guaranteed to go nowhere, because if different folks take
    different, contradictory texts--Jewish, Christian, and Islamic--as the authoritative
    answer, then each ends with their own belief, end of story. \r\n\r\nAziz, there
    is no direct reference to democracy in the portions you quote, and I know other
    Muslims think that democracy is compatible with the Quran. And there are many
    Muslim countries explicitly devoted to ideals of democracy. And Googling, here
    is one such discussion of the issue: www.4islamicschools.org/images/Democracy%20in%20Islam%20Final-Yasmeen%20Qadri.doc
    \ \r\n\r\nAs I indicated earlier, even within Jewish tradition, I think that claim
    that the letter shapes of the current Hebrew script is sacred is problematic.
    The statement in the Mishna (Pirkei Avot, chapter 5) is that God made the stylus,
    the script, and the tablets (of the Ten Commandments). It does not say what script,
    and I believe the sages of the Talmud somewhere discuss that the script on the
    tablets would not have been the current square, pen written script. The sages
    were well aware that it was not the original Hebrew script, and the tablets may
    well have been inscribed with an Egyptian script, which Moses and other Israelites
    who were literate would have understood at that time.\r\n\r\nThe point of the
    Talmud 'word play' discussions is to make a moral or theological point, and not
    that the form of the script is sacred. The message that the text is giving is
    what is supposed to be sacred, not the form of the script itself. \r\n\r\nThe
    midrashim on the letter shapes that Israel cites are I believe relatively late.
    One of the links given by Israel quotes the founder of Chabad Chassidism, which
    Israel is a follower of. And he is late 18th century. The Zohar, the basic Jewish
    mystical work, is 13th century. These are recent inventions, as Jewish history
    goes, being 2000 or more years after Moses. \r\n\r\nAlso, in the view of almost
    all scholars, the Zohar is pseudepigrapha, meaning it is falsely attributed to
    someone else, in this case a sage who lived a thousand years before it was written.
    For a rationalist like myself, this seriously undermines its credibility.\r\n\r\nI
    want to learn from the mystical tradition, but I take it with a huge amount of
    salt, because as an historian of ideas, I know that it is a mish-mash of eclectic
    sources. A primary source of the ideas about God in the Zohar is Plotinus, the
    Neo-Platonic Greek philosopher. He, not the Torah, is the source of ideas about
    'emanations' of God creating the world. Isaac Luria, in what is the most original
    idea in Jewish mysticism that I know about, reversed this and said that God created
    the world by withdrawing from part of it. \r\n\r\nThis is all interesting, but
    much of Kabbala to me is capricious and even heretical by older standards in Judaism.
    And there are many others who are of the same opinion.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Aziz,\r\n\r\nIgnoring wise old William's advice, I engage in minor debate
    with you. Please do not take any offense, as I am speaking both civily and highly
    respectfully. As you know, the Quran directs Muslims to heed Torah-practicing
    Jews and give them unprecedented respect and tolerance, lest Allah's wrath be
    invoked upon them.\r\n\r\nNot a single passage that you quoted from the Quran
    support your rejection of certain aspects of democracy. Exclamation mark.\r\n\r\nYou
    are going on a tangent, citing Islam's disapproval of headenistic societies and
    their peoples.\r\n\r\nI am refering not to a hedonistic society, nor to a immoral
    people, for Orthodox Judaism too disapproves of them, and rejects them. But Orthodox
    Judaism also rejects \"living by the sword\" and promotes tolerance. This is cultural
    tolerance in the sense that we believe our faith is superior and will conquer
    not by physical force or the threat of murderous harm, but by the \"word of G-d\"
    and living in accord with G-d's directives, to set a good and living example for
    others to keep. As they say, \"yad hachassidim al haelyona\".\r\n\r\nRather, I
    am refering to the just and righteous aspects of democracy, which is based in
    the teachings of Torah. Such as the respect and value for human life, the superiority
    of women over men (the Western mind only tries to offer women equality), the importance
    and empowerment of voting etc.\r\n\r\nThese are values (except for the notion
    that women are superior to men) which are embraced by Islam.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,
    the Quran which you quote does not contradict my supposition that Allah wants
    us to be somewhat democratic."

    phrase in Pirkei Avot refers not to any style of Hebrew letter forms. A more recent

    you can't take the trouble to read what I wrote. And your rudeness is breathtaking.
    I just take comfort that here you belittle everyone who disagrees with you; it's
    not just me. \r\n\r\nMy point was exactly that Avot doesn't refer to any specific
    letter forms, Hebrew or otherwise. What you are accusing me of being ignorant
    of is exactly the point I was trying to make. \r\n\r\nOn the translation. The
    phrase in Avot is \"haketav, vehamikhtav (or vehamachtav--the original has no
    nikud), vehaluchot\". The classic translation of Hertz has it, \"the writing on
    the tables, the instrument of writing, and the tables of stone.\" My translation
    is \"the script, the stylus, the tablets.\" According to Alcalay, \"script\" is
    one translation of \"ketav\". For example, \"ketav rashi\" is \"rashi script\".
    If my translation is a mistake I would like to correct it, but I first have to
    hear why it is wrong. It has been checked by one who knows Mishnaic Hebrew very
    well. Perhaps David would have a view. \r\n\r\nAs to the Rabbis being aware that
    the square script was not likely to be engraved on the Tablets of the Ten Commandments,
    I see a reference to a discussion where they considered that they may have been
    written in ancient Hebrew script. This is in the Jerusalem Talmud: Meg. 1:11,
    71c. And as I said the rabbis also do refer to current square Hebrew script as
    'assyrian' or 'chaldean', i.e. aramaic. \r\n\r\nAs you will see by looking at
    the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet|wikipedia article on the Hebrew
    alphabet]] the shape of the original Hebrew script--Paleo Hebrew--is very different.
    For example the aleph does not have the shape you refer to above, and so the midrash
    you give would not apply.\r\n\r\nSo the point is that the your midrashim do not
    apply to what was written on the Tablets of the Ten Commandments. Clear? \r\n\r\nAs
    to the possibility that even other dialects than Hebrew may have been written
    on the Ten Commandment, I don't remember where I read that, but I did. I would
    track it down, but my point is made anyway, and I hope I can resist the temptation
    to post in the future, because your rudeness makes it no fun. \r\n\r\n"

    role of politics for serving a role in religion is the stature of true leadership.\r\n\r\nThe
    individuals which you cite are mainly power lords in the worst definition of politics,
    and true leaders. In that poor sense politics is really just an antithesis of
    the ideals of religion or truth.\r\n\r\nTrue leaders, on the other hand, are very
    rare, and really are much higher than politics.\r\n\r\nSo, in the end, I must
    agree in part with you."

  body: "The Meaning of Aleph\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThe seventh Lubavitcher
    Rebbe explains that the alef has three different meanings. \r\n\r\nOne is aluf,
    which means a master or a chief. \r\n\r\nThe second is ulfana, a school of learning
    or teacher. \r\n\r\nThe third meaning is reached by reading the letters of the
    word backwards-pela (pronounced peleh)-wondrous.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nAluf's definition
    is \"master.\" \r\n\r\nThis lets the world know that there is a Creator; that
    G-d is the Master of the universe, and that there is an Eye that sees, and an
    Ear that hears. The universe did not simply emerge by itself; there is an omnipotent
    Force that actually forged the firmaments ex nihilo, from nothing to something.
    Thus G-d is the Aluf, the Master of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlfana means \"school\"
    or \"teacher.\" \r\n\r\nNot only do we introduce G-d as the Creator of the universe,
    but also as the Teacher of all mankind. G-d's role as teacher is revealed with
    His introduction of Torah to the Jewish people. The Torah, with its 613 mitzvos
    or laws, teaches us what we should do, and what we shouldn't do. Through the Divine
    wisdom of His book, G-d establishes Himself in the world on the level of the ultimate
    Teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the third meaning of alef: peleh, \"wondrous.\"
    \r\n\r\nPeleh represents the esoteric or mystical level of Torah-Kabbalah and
    the teachings of Chassidic thought. Known as the \"teachings of Mashiach,\" these
    secrets of Torah comprise its greatest level.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom \"Letters of Light\"

    1. Will you sacrifice yourself for your religion?\r\n\r\nRabbi Joseph Isaac Shneersohn
    obm wrote about difference between the great Rabbi Akiva and our common forefather
    Abraham \r\n\r\nRabbi Akiva sacrificed himself to the Roman occupiers. He even
    yearned for this, to finally show G-d that he was ready to set aside his own body
    to be G-d's servant.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Abraham did not yearn for this at all.
    Rather, Abraham and his wife Sarah, resttled near Beersheva in order to host,
    feed, and teach travelors about the existance of G-d, and His being the Master
    of the Universe, in charge of the workings of the world. He was ready to set aside
    his own soul to be G-d's servant.\r\n\r\nRabbi Shneersohn concludes that Abraham's
    path to be G-d's servant was greater than Rabbi Akiva.\r\n\r\n\r\n> 2. Where does
    Man go after death?\r\n\r\nMany people never die at all. Rather, they live in
    different worlds, as this material world that we know is only a stage in this
    cycle. This is detailed at length in Jewish mystical literature at length.\r\n\r\nOther
    people are \"cut off\" due to actions in this material world (although it would
    seem that this possibility exists also in other worlds). This is called: \"koret
    hanefesh\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly, due to other wrongful things and attitudes, some
    people's bodies are not resurrected at the \"end of days\", and experience death
    forever.\r\n\r\nThe human body (after the resurrection) in the next world is physical
    and nourishes the soul, unlike today that the life of the body depends upon its
    being nourished from the soul. However, the human body of the next world is very
    unlike our bodies today which age and decay.\r\n\r\n> 3. Does it make difference
    to die easy or hard?\r\n\r\nDeath for some is a movement from one world to another.
    Death for others is final,\r\n\r\nTo die easy for some is a blessing, without
    pain and with even a smile on the face. Great people knew this event was imminent,
    and prepared, having no remorse.\r\n\r\nAlthough many great people died painfully,
    or hard, this sort of sad ending is viewed ordinarily as a curse. \r\n\r\nThere
    are exceptions, such as dying \"al peeh keedush Hashem\", giving up for one's
    live to show people that the person prefers death to disobeying G-d, such as the
    Jews of the Inqusition, or to show people that they prefer to remain Jewish, like
    the Jews of the Holocaust, or to protect the lives of other Jews, such as soldiers
    of Israel.\r\n\r\nIn this exceptional case, the victim's souls are automatically
    forgiven any sins, and enter \"gan eden\", the world of the soul's reward, directly,
    with no interuption of punishments.\r\n\r\nNasrallah however will be the kind
    that dies with a curse. The merit of his anscestors he lost, and now shall only
    deserve maximum punishment.\r\n\r\nAs they say in Mexico, \"Adios.\"\r\n"

    as the cultural significance of the pomegranate is not one thing but many things.
    Of course it is possible that one culture's traditions re. the divine origin of

    the Nazi definition of Jewishness was racial rather than religious or cultural,
    there was no option for Jews to be anything other than Jewish. There was no issue
    of 'remaining Jewish' because the Nazis saw no possibility that a Jew could cease

    Lebanon.\r\n\r\nWe have never discussed the status of people in an after-life
    who harm Jews in this world.\r\n\r\nFirst, regarding your inerence which assumes
    hell is an option.\r\n\r\nRemember, in Judaism, unlike most religions that define
    hell as a form of eternal punishment, hell is not a form of eternal punishment.
    Rather, it is a cleansing process for the soul, to prepare it for heaven, gan
    eden, a termporal place too for spiritual reward for the non-physical soul.\r\n\r\nHeaven
    is only a temporary holding place until after the end of days, when the body is
    revived, or resorrected in a new form. Then, the soul returns to the body, and
    in many cases lives forever.\r\n\r\nAbout going to hell or heaven, I merely said
    that people who sacrifice their lives in protect Jews receive a special reward
    and avoid hell.\r\n\r\nWe see going to hell is a step to going to hell. Not everyone
    earns this merit.\r\n\r\nSome people are reincarnated in non-human bodies, a rather
    painful experience. Some people get even worse, such as becoming migrant souls
    without even physical bodies, like bodies of objects, vegetables, stones, minerals,
    dirt, and sand - or nothing physical at all.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the comment
    of a friend of mine, who learned this, and said: \"It's a zechus (merit) to go
    to hell\".\r\n\r\nThe famous great commentator, Rabbi Solomon Yitchaki of the
    Middle Ages, known by the acronym of his name, Rashi, commented on the ill intend
    some nomads harbored towards him, that they earned Divine retribution from G-d
    for merely thinking to harm him. \r\n\r\nAlso, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe pointed
    out a simple law in Shulchan (the Codes of Jewish Law)  regarding the neighbors
    bordering Israel who seek to merely steal wheat, as subject of a strong defence,
    including murder. The justification for this extreme reaction is that if stealing
    was planned, murder was intended. The defense to those who seek to kill, is to
    kill them first.\r\n\r\nFrom these statements, it is clear that the Hezzbolah
    terrorists, like other terrorists, have sealed there own fate by seeking and even
    actually harming or killing Jews.\r\n\r\nThis is the harse reality of harming
    or killing a Jew.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> my words were neither untrue...\r\n\r\nOverview of the Composition of Jewry
    on Earth\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nJews are divided
    into two categhories: affiliated and unaffiliated.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are one
    one people, Jews are different from each other, like every human being is unigue.\r\n\r\nThere
    are however differences and groups.\r\n\r\nThe largest categhory are unaffiliated
    Jews. If you add up the membership of all groups of affiliated Jews, there are
    much more unaffiliated Jews.\r\n\r\nAmong the largest group of affiliated Jews
    in number in the United States are Reform Jewry. Second are Conservative Jews.
    In an embarassing third spot are the Orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nOutside of America, be
    it South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Orient, both the Reform
    and Conservative are very very small, barely significant.\r\n\r\nI am reminded
    of a secular Israeli's comment why he went to an observant synagogue in Israel
    on Yom Kippur, when he himself was not observant. Why didn't he just drive to
    then lone Reform temple in Israel? He replied that if he went to the synagogue
    once a year, he wanted to get it right.\r\n\r\nSo, in Israel, like in most places
    of the world, unaffiliated Jews perceive \"real\" Judaism as the beliefs of those
    follow in the ways of Torah. The rest is just compromise, or even worst, fake.\r\n\r\nAmong
    so-called Orthodoxy, there are many sects, larger and smaller in number, but divided
    differently in terms of signacance and influence.\r\n\r\nQuantity versus quality.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, these Jews are divided into the Chassidic Jews (the followers of the
    Baal Shem Tov), and non-Chassidic Jews. In the last twoi hundred years, the Chassidim
    are becoming a dominant force in Judaism, and the other groups, whether non-Chassidic,
    or even non-Orthodox, are dwindling in size.\r\n\r\nWith the next fifty or 100
    years, with the factors of assimilation, population growth, and increased communication,
    only the group of Chassidic Jews will remain among the affiliated, and the unaffiliated
    will decrease or assimilate.\r\n\r\nThat's the harshe reality, William.\r\n\r\nAmong
    Chassidic Jews, everyone are followers of the holy Baal Shem Tov. They are divided
    into two branches: the intellectual of ChaBaD (now only the Lubavitchers remain),
    and ChaGaT, the other groups of Chassidic Jews.\r\n\r\nWhat does ChaBaD and ChaGaT
    mean, how are they different?\r\n\r\nThere are ten spheres in the Divine chemestry
    of everything created by G-d. They are:\r\n\r\n1. Chochmah - literally, wisdom;
    or the first and highest sphere. Like the human body has intellectual parts in
    the brain, and emotive parts in the rest of the body (modern science says everthing
    is located in the brain), in the intellectual process, chochmah is the initial
    stage of the intellect, conception of an idea.\r\n\r\n2. Binah - literally, understanding;
    or the second and decisive sphere. In the intellectual process, binah is the next
    stage of the intellect, the break-down and analysis of an idea.\r\n\r\n3. Daat
    - literally, knowledge; or the last and most important sphere. In the intellectual
    process, daat is the next stage of the intellect, the practical application of
    an idea.\r\n\r\nChabad then is symbolized by this acronym of the three parts of
    the intellectual process.\r\n\r\nChaGaT is an acronym for the next three spheres,
    the first three parts of the emotions.\r\n\r\nBasically, they represent two valid
    manners to live life as G-d desires.\r\n\r\nThe Chabad way is much more difficult
    and demanding than Chagat in terms of living life practically. Chabad however
    is much richer, more rewarding, and has the ability to become integrated into
    unaffiliated Jewish society, not be influenced (to the amazement of other Orthodox
    Jews), and rather make amazing inroads. \r\n\r\nThousands of unaffiliated Jews
    have joined the ranks of Chabad in the last few decades. Chabad Houses have sprung
    up around the globe in greater number recently, than even during the lifetime
    of their leader. Chabad is at fore front of disseminating knowledge of Judaism
    at www.chabad.org, even among non-Jews.\r\n\r\nIt is not without exaggeration
    to claim that if we consider the huge numbers of \"Friens of Lubavitch\" (which
    now number many hundreds of thousands, including heads of state, unaffiliated
    Jews, and a growing part of the masses), Chabad is most dynamic force in Judaism
    today.\r\n\r\nAs the first Lubavitcher Rebbe prophezed in the days of the Vilna
    Gaon: \"Yad hachassidim al haelyona\". In the end, the Chassidim will prevail!"

    No Observant Jew would risk his or her heavenly reward to commit such a crime.
    To commit such a crime also evokes eternal punishment.\r\n\r\nUntil relatively
    recently, all Jews were observant of the teachings of Torah. Nobody second-guessed

    + Bible?\r\n\r\nThis question has been asked repeatedly for nearly two thousand
    years. It has been articulately addressed completely by scholars to whom by comparison
    I am less than a toenail. \r\n\r\nNachmonides was challenged to a debate by great
    Catholic scholars in Spain(?)regarding this very topic. He answered each question
    more than convincingly and decisively. In fact, hehad to flee his own country
    to save his life, because the very people he argued against saught to kill cf
    for his brilliant answers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, his debates are not published
    in English. So, I will briefly answer.\r\n\r\nJesus the Jew, the student of Rabbi
    Yossi's yeshiva, the person who grew up like every \"frum\" Jewish boy, wearing
    tzitzis, a kippah, eating only kosher food, washing negel vasser, was rejected
    as the messiah, then, in the past 2000 years, and to this very day, and forever.\r\n\r\nWhy
    was Jesus rejected as the long awaited messiah?\r\n\r\nTo be qualified to the
    messiah in potential, according to Judaism, the person must meet specific qualifications.
    He did not meet any of them.\r\n\r\n1. He has to be a descendant of King David.
    It is unclear who Jesus' father was.\r\n\r\n2. He has to be a great Torah scholar,
    like King David before him. Jesus abandoned his studies in yeshiva, losing out
    on possibility of great scholarship.\r\n\r\n3. He must encourage all humanity
    to come closer to G-d: Jews to observe Judaism, non-Jews to accept and practice
    the Seven Noahide rules expected from them by G-d. Jesus has brought strife among
    peoples, and led many generations of his followers to murder Jews, Muslims, and
    opponants to Christianity.\r\n\r\n4. He shall build the 3rd Holy Temple in Jerusalem,
    where the Jews will have a place to worship and serv G-d, and the non-Jews will
    be able to have a direct relationship with G-d. Jesus failed to end the Roman
    occupation, and even was hung on the cross by the Romans.\r\n\r\n5. He will usher
    in a time of universal peace and brotherhood among mankind. Jesus caused people
    to hate each other. His followers claim that by believing in him, they are then
    absolved of their sins. In effect, people become further and further from G-d
    by hinking that it's OK to sin.\r\n\r\nThere is not a single compelling reason
    to accept Jesus."

    was caught eating something not kosher: \u201CIt\u2019s not important what goes
    in your mouth, rather it\u2019s more important what goes out of your mouth.\u201D>\r\n\r\nI
    have heard that Jesus, (Yeshua) never broke the Torah.  I like knowing the truth
    about things, so I had to research this and this is what I found:\r\n\r\n\"Dietary
    laws\" is NOT what Yeshua chastised \"them\" = P'rushim \r\n(\"Pharisees\") and
    Torah-teachers (\"teachers of the Law\") for.\r\nIn context of Chapter 7 of Mark,
    the first 7 verses are \r\nimportant - JNT (David H. Stern):\r\n\r\n-------\r\n(1)
    The P'rushim and some of the Torah-teachers who had \r\ncome from Yerushalayim
    gathered together with Yeshua \r\n(2) and saw that some of his talmidim (\"disciples\")
    ate with \r\nritually unclean hands, that is, without doing n'tilat-yadayim \r\n(\"ritual
    handwashing\"). (3) ( For the P'rushim, and indeed \r\nall the Judeans, holding
    fast to the Tradition of the Elders, \r\ndo not eat unless they have given their
    hands a ceremonial \r\nwashing. (4) Also, when they come from the marketplace
    \r\nthey do not eat unless they have rinsed their hands up to \r\nthe wrist; and
    they adhere to many other traditions, such \r\nas washing cups, pots, and bronze
    vessels.)\r\n\r\n(5) The P'rushim and the Torah-teachers asked him, \"Why \r\ndon't
    your talmidim live in accordance with the Tradition of \r\nthe Elders, but instead
    eat with ritually unclean hands?\"\r\n(6) Yeshua answered them, \"Yesha'yahu (\"Isaiah\")
    was right \r\nwhen he prophesied about you hypocrites - as it is written,\r\n\r\n\"These
    people honor me with their lips,\r\nbut their hearts are far away from me.\r\n(7)
    Their worship of me is useless, because they teach \r\nman-made rules as if they
    were doctrines.\" (Isaiah 29:13)\r\n-------\r\n\r\nObviously, Yeshua's talmidim
    did not violate kosher laws \r\nsince the P'rushim and Torah-teachers would have
    mentioned \r\nthat. The discussion was concerning the Oral Tradition in \r\nrelation
    to n'tilat-yadayim.\r\n\r\nYeshua is chastising the P'rushim and Torah-teachers
    for \r\nstrict adherence to the Oral Torah and misunderstanding the \r\npriority
    of Torah over tradition (\"laws of men\").\r\n\r\nHere is some of Stern's commentary
    on Mk 7:19 wherein there \r\nis a parenthetical comment \"Thus he declared all
    foods ritually \r\nclean\" ( \"food\" to a Torah-observing Jew is not equivalent
    to \r\nfood in today's world obviously; it is what is allowed to be \r\neaten
    for a Torah-abiding person):\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\"Thus he declared all foods
    ritually clean\", even if the \r\nparticipants at the meal have not washed their
    hands. But \r\nYeshua did not, as many suppose, abrogate the laws of \r\nkashrut
    and thus declare ham kosher! Since the beginning of \r\nthe chapter the subject
    has been ritual purity as taught by \r\nthe Oral Torah in relation to n'tilat-yadayim
    (vv.2-4) and not \r\nkashrut at all! There is not the slightest hint anywhere
    that \r\nfoods in this verse can be anything other than what the \r\nBible allows
    Jews to eat, in other words, kosher foods. \r\nNeither is kashrut abolished in
    Ac 10:9-28 or Ga 2:11-16; see\r\nnotes there.\r\n\r\nRather, Yeshua is continuing
    his discussion in spiritual \r\nprioritizing (v.11). He teaches that tohar (purity)
    is not\r\nprimarily ritual or physical, but spiritual (vv.14-23). On this \r\nground
    he does not entirely overrule the Pharisaic/rabbinic\r\nelaborations of the laws
    of purity, but he does demote them to \r\nsubsidiary importance. See Jn 7:22-23
    on the halakhic process \r\nof assigning ranks to potentially conflicting laws.
    Yeshua here \r\nis making a Messianic halakhah.\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrown

    anyone.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that as a Christian your view and my view differ a
    great deal regarding Jesus' status, role, and stature. \r\n\r\nPlus, we live in
    a benevolent Christian land (although the founding father clearly desired it to
    be home for all peoples), so I think it unwise to argue the host's faith. Rather,
    the Jewish attitude is both national pride and patriotism, and to respect adversity.\r\n\r\nTo
    clarify one point that you made though, about the status of the Oral Tradition
    in normative Judaism, now, then, and since Mt. Sinai (and from even earlier),
    is that all Jews share one single view. The Torah is one, the writings of the
    Hebrew explanations, the Oral Tradition, later recorded in the Talmud, Medrash,
    Kabbalistic books, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nJews do not pick and choose, what parts
    they accept and believe in, or what parts are too difficult for them to observe,
    or even accept.\r\n\r\nThose who reject parts of the Torah, such as the Oral Tradition
    are not considered Jews. Thw Karraites are an example of this. (Jesus was not
    a Karraite.)\r\n\r\nEven Conservative and Reform Jews, who reject parts of Halacha
    in everyday practice, or concepts that they feel are no longer applicable, are
    not considered rejected or not Jewish. A Jew is always a Jew. Rather, they fall
    under the heading in Jewish law, known as \"tinuk sh'nishba\", a Jewish child
    who abducted and raised non-Jewish. This explains why his or her attitude is not
    in compliance with the teachings of Torah.\r\n\r\nSo, no one today opposes Torah
    anymore. We see that even Muslim and Christians are moving closer to improvement
    of relationships, limited acceptance, and much greater cooperation.\r\n\r\nI truly
    believe that the more a person learns about the beauty of Judaism, the more they
    seek to come closer to G-d, and life in accord with the lifestyle that the Torah
    teaches, be in the life of Torah and mitzvahs, or the Noahide laws."

    meaning of the \"aleph\"\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThe Lubavitchwer Rebbe explains
    that the alef has three different meanings. One is aluf, which means a master
    or a chief. The second is ulfana, a school of learning or teacher. The third meaning
    is reached by reading the letters of the word backwards-pela (pronounced peleh)-wondrous.\r\n\r\nAluf's
    definition is \"master.\" This lets the world know that there is a Creator; that
    G-d is the Master of the universe, and that there is an Eye that sees, and an
    Ear that hears. The universe did not simply emerge by itself; there is an omnipotent
    Force that actually forged the firmaments ex nihilo, from nothing to something.
    Thus G-d is the Aluf, the Master of the universe.\r\n\r\nUlfana means \"school\"
    or \"teacher.\" Not only do we introduce G-d as the Creator of the universe, but
    also as the Teacher of all mankind. G-d's role as teacher is revealed with His
    introduction of Torah to the Jewish people. The Torah, with its 613 mitzvos or
    laws, teaches us what we should do, and what we shouldn't do. Through the Divine
    wisdom of His book, G-d establishes Himself in the world on the level of the ultimate
    Teacher.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the third meaning of alef: peleh, \"wondrous.\"
    Peleh represents the esoteric or mystical level of Torah-Kabbalah and the teachings
    of Chassidic thought. Known as the \"teachings of Mashiach,\" these secrets of
    Torah comprise its greatest level.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the book, \"Letters of Light\",

    into geulah/redemption). \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geulah_3812.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus
    the final two thousand years of Creation, the era of Mashiach, is represented
    by the alef. Having been given the alef, the Jewish people are empowered to move
    from exile to redemption. \r\n\r\nThe stages of G-d as Master of the universe
    and as Teacher blossom into the days of Mashiach, when G-d will be revealed on
    a wondrous level. All of this is contained in the letter alef.\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom

    than the name change they never talked about life before America.  So I was raised

    font. It's for free, for non-commercial users. It's advanced OpenType. I have
    a sample posted on the lower part of the blog called \"Hebrew Type Designs\".
    Also, check out \"David\".\r\n\r\nGaining a religious lifestyle later in life
    helps us contrast the alternative. Many times, aerson appreciates something he
    or she has after realizing what it's like not to have it.\r\n\r\nIt's sad that
    your great-grandfather parted ways with his brother. Are you in contact with his
    descendants, your cousins?\r\n\r\nAs you may know, Judaism defines a Jewish person
    by maternal descent or a valid halachic conversion. To be designated Jewish, your
    maternal ascent must be born Jewish, or converted according to halacha. That means,
    your mom, her mom, and her mom. Three generations. If that is certain, then you
    are certainly Jewish.\r\n\r\nIf, however, your dad was Jewish, but not your mom,
    or your maternal grandfather but not his wife, or your maternal grandmother's
    dad but not her mom, then you are not Jewish in your soul, but you have a lot
    of \"blood\" and genes that are Jewish.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other religions, Judaism
    allots great significance to non-Jews who conduct their lives according to what's
    known as the Seven Noahide Laws, including eternal reward. In fact, to a certain
    degree, it is of greater significance to be a Noahide than to be Jewish in that
    the messiah can not arrive until non-Jews have a choice to become Noahides, just
    as G-d did not give the Jewish people the Torah until Jethro, Moses' non-Jewish
    father-in-law converted to Judaism."

    in words which have nikkud is certainly the custom in most modern Hebrew text.
    In Jewish liturgy, from the booklet on Birkat Hamazon, the grace after meals,
    to the Siddur, the traditional prayerbook, inclusion of the vov (shuruk, or holam)
    always appear. \r\n\r\nThe exceptions, as I understand it, in intentional, to
    teach an important lesson, as in Biblical literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nikkud_vov_4528.jpg]\r\n.\r\n.\r\nRegarding
    the dagesh in the peh of ulfana, the author did not place this either. I figured
    that perhaps in Aramaic, a dagesh does not appear here. So, I did not include
    it.\r\n\r\nAs the original text was all in English, I was unsure if the word ended
    in a hei oran aleph.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dagesh in the gimmel of geula, you might
    be right. Although you know, most dagesh is missing in modern Hebrew with nikkud,
    except for the beit, kaf, peh, and taf. The dagesh in other letters is merely
