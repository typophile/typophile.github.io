My most influential book is Paul Rand's 'A designer's Art'.
I bought this whilst at college and I can refer to it when I need to know what Paul Rand would have done.
[I have just seen it on the shelf with 6 bits of paper sticking out the top of it!]
The partner to this is the Tanaka Ikko Book (Phidon).

I did this interface for fun around 2000.

Today, half a century  later, I would agree with James Montalbano and say Frutiger's  "Complete Works" is a must read.

		<div class="commentbody">This is a hard one; there are so many candidates. I'd probably give the nod to two: <em>Jan Tschichold: typographer</em> by Ruari McLean, and <em>The Design of Books</em> by Adrian Wilson. I never met either Tschichold or Wilson (I never met McLean either, but I spoke with him on the phone), but they had an enormous influence on my design aesthetic. And, through Adrian Wilson's book, I was also strongly influenced by Jack Stauffacher, although I didn't really know where the influence came from until I met Jack some years later. All of these typographers were concerned with readable text, and with effective design that aided the reader, not the ego of the designer. (Jack Stauffacher still is, I'm happy to say.) Trendy books are useless. Actually, they're more than useless: they're often pernicious. Though as Ben McElroy (<em>bemerx25</em>) points out, even those can serve as the spur to get us interested.

		<div class="commentbody">this old, small, tattered red-covered hardbound book called 'painting signs and sho cards' by e.c. matthews from 1920 that my dad had. it shared commercial art and composition philosophies as well as the intricacies of using type and lettering to set the mood and speaking to your audience or market. very little about set type but mostly about handpainting and fountain pen lettering. timeless design principles came from this little unassuming book that i still have to this day.
