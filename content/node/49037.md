body: "Hi\r\nI found some interesting theatre posters ages ago and loved the lettering,
  especially the first one with its watery curves and painty texture. I'm wondering
  about how possible it might be to create a font from these letters and hoped there
  might be ideas from other typophiles on an approach to it:\r\nWould you start with
  a paintbrush and practise drawing the character shapes, swirls and get some interesting
  textures? If so, what kind of brush/paint/paper/canvas would you suggest? Or start
  with a scan and build the missing characters from existing elements? \r\nShould
  I try to keep the messiness or clean up the edges? Are there other fonts like these?
  Are there any copyright issues with trying this?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to decide if
  this is something I can do or if it's too big a project, so any feedback gratefully
  received.\r\n\r\nCheers :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/posters_5970.jpg]"
