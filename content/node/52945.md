  road. \r\n\r\nA young designer I work with has chosen DIN Black all caps for a clients'
  corporate word mark ( I know most German designers will be shaking their heads,
  apologies to them...) The client has approved it and he needs to come up with a
  secondary sans serif typeface for the tag line. He's in a panic so I thought I'd
  put it out there to you all. I can't include the word mark or tag line for confidentiality
  reasons.\r\n\r\nAny initial thoughts or reccos are appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    to more rounded.\r\nFrom these i'd try Fago first.\r\n\r\nBTW \r\nPMN Caecila
    can look very good together with FF Din All Caps"
