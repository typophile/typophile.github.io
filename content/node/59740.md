  that I have. Anyone know what exact font this is?

  body: It's been modified. Some of the terminals are rounded. Have a look <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/soft_rounded_sans/">here</a>
    for alternatives.

  body: I figured the rounded terminals were a rendering issue. Oh well.

  body: "There is a freefont which was built after a typeface in an old book from
    Josef M\xFCller-Brockmann. Which was obviously Helvetica. Now this \xBBversion\xAB
    has rounded terminals, so try <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=haas&nb_ppp_old=10&page=1&text=Better+talk+to+Adam&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha\">Alte
    Haas Grotesk</a> by yann le coroller.\r\n\r\n@Stewf: your link is broken. \r\n\r\n"

    this exact one yet.\r\n\r\n@Renki - that is pretty close! I can that isn't THE
    typeface but it sure is close... thank you so much for that... and free to boot,
    you're the man!\r\n\r\nI'll continue to look, as I've fallen in love this typeface,
    lol... thank you for your help!"

  body: Looking a little more closely, Alte Haas Grostesk seems unusable due to the
    poor quality of the rendering :(

  body: Melo - I doubt you'll find the font commercially available. It's probably
    a proprietary modification specially for Adam.
