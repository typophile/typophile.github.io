		<div class="commentbody">Not long after that thread, Kivart replied to my e-mail. I had encouraged him to contact Fred Peter. <BR> <BR>Instead, Kivart, who had created the font from an image of the lettering provided by a friend, was aghast that the lettering was actually an existing (albeit dry transfer only) typeface. He pulled Gamme from his website and would not reconsider. <BR> <BR>I remain very sorry to have played a part in that. Subsequent efforts by myself to contact Mr. Peter have been unsuccessful.</div>

I did managed to scan it at high resolution from the letraset book,  <BR>and did it the old fashion way&hellip;cut and paste. <BR> <BR>Now the question I wonder about; Technically speaking is this a breach of copy right even if I don't sell it to others. <BR>&quot;Heck I can't get it anywhere else&quot; is my justification.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This looks like a thread in which I made the first post – but it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a portion of an older thread that someone else revived.</p>
<p>Jorge: Gamme isn&rsquo;t mine to give you. You would have to get the permission of Fred Peter and Kivart - in that order.</p>
<p>I really wish that Kivart had tried to talk to Fred Peter and try to come to some agreement, but he chose not to. It probably didn&rsquo;t help that he was shot in a drive-by posting here by a respected name in typography – in which he was effectively called a &ldquo;font pirate&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Because serious very good that gave me a way to contact this person: Kivart to see that one can make in this respect, I think that there is not anything bad in carrying out a file TTF with some design in I specify, bad serious that one carried out it with ends of lucre or to market a work that doesn&rsquo;t belong together for royalty, there if that is Pirate of the worst that works are awarded that you/they have not made, in the personal thing I have carried out one that another file only for personal satisfaction and it doesn&rsquo;t stop to market neither to make money with something that is not mine.</p>
<p>but good in short, I need you help me to contact to kivart to see I eat up he/she can help!</p>
<p>Jajajaja Excuses my translation to English, since not yet you to speak to it very single leeo and I understand what you/they write, for that reason I appeal a translator for computer<br>
Thank you again!<br>
Greetings from Mexico! :)</p>
