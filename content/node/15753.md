body: I am designing a book for a client, and i am wondering about purchasing a font
  for this project. The book will not be part of  series, but i would sure like to
  keep it for later use. Who should pay for the font? Me or the customer?

  body: If you want to keep it, you ought to pay for it. Of course, that doesn't preclude
    your charging your customer a fee for use of the font.

  body: I don't usually charge the client for fonts. If the client wants to use the
    font themselves, I tell them to buy it themselves. To me, fonts are overhead,
    like computer equipment and office supplies. Each new job is an opportunity to
    expand my existing font library for future jobs.

  body: 'I agree with Mark on this one. When I license type it becomes part of my
    toolbox from which I can later draw for future clients. However, if the client
    does like the typeface, and I''ve had this happen, you can always educate them
    and show them how they can license it for their own use. '

  body: "isn't it a smart move to at least try to pass that cost (or a percentage
    of the cost) onto the client? perhaps it would also help to raise awareness about
    the cost of good type and some of the ethics regarding font piracy.\r\n\r\ni'mean,
    when you charge your clients for other (overhead) costs such as toner/proofs or
    photography/stock photos, it only seems logical.\r\n\r\nif you don't feel comfortable
    billing it out to your client (directly), you should at least make them aware
    that those kind of costs are built into your rate so they don't freak out when
    they get your invoice... \r\n\r\n= ^ 0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: That is another way to look at it. I suppose I am thinking of those who might
    "bury" the font cost into the project and not use it as an opportunity to educate.
    If it is used to educate the client and the client won't scoff and insist that
    they now should own a copy, then, of course, I think education is a good thing.
