body: "I'm looking for something similar to Amplitude. By similar I mean something
  that is sans, is a little bit agressive, has display size qualities yet could still
  be used for short text sized advertising paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIf any of this makes
  sense.\r\n\r\nIt would be a primary face for a corporate identity. Our budget is
  just a bit less than would be needed to purchase the entire amplitude family. Im
  looking for something that can come in around $200 for the family, or at least under
  $300.\r\n\r\nAny bright ideas?"

    weights and widths do you truly need? Example: get 4 weights of Amplitude in 2
    widths for $280.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FB.111841.0.0\">Amplitude
