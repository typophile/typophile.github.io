  body: "It looks quite similar to the new revival by Canada Type of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/mayfair/\">Mayfair</a>
    by R. H. Middleton, from the 1930's. Your sample looks bolder, and the 'a' and
    'm' aren't exactly the same, but added stroke would get you pretty close.\r\n\r\n-
