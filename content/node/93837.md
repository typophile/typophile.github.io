    the \u201CType Design\u201D tab and then click \u201CList of fonts\u201D on the
    bottom. You\u2019d see Euclid on the third line from the top.)\r\nThough <a href=\"http://swisstypefaces.com/fonts/euclid-bp/all-styles/\">the
    retail version</a> is a little bit different. (Have a look at the y and the s.)"

    body: Brilliant, thank you so much. Yes strange that the retail version has such
      subtle differences. A shame because I prefer the "original" y and s! Ahh I was
      hoping there was more than 1 weight available but oh well! Thanks again for
      your quick reply!
