  many geometric circles and I wanted to try and find a sans-serif with rounded corners
  that would harmonize with the perfect circles in the logo design. I am presenting
  type treatments in U&lc as well as all caps. I would like the typeface to have a
  normal width, not too condensed or too expanded.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of Bryant
  or VAG rounded but I thought there might be better faces to match the perfect circles
  used in the logo design.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nRegards, Sal"
