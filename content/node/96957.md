  Some conflicting geometries, plus staring at it for far too long, are making me
  question a number of the pairs. Any feedback? Thanks!\r\n-B"

  body: I'd say ND is a bit too loose, and AR might be <em>marginally</em> too loose.
    Looks great otherwise.

  body: 'thanks, guys. Yeah, the letterform proportions are a bit wonky. But for now
    I need to work with what I''ve got, and just get the spacing of the current forms
    even. '

  body: "Initial impressions are that the M & A at the beginning appear smaller than
    the rest of the letters (is this what hrant is referring to about proportions?)\r\n\r\nFrom
    what I can see it's difficult to kern because of those proportional issues stemming
    at the sharp points of M A & A and this is what throws everything slightly off
    balance. Possibly a little more space between the three verticals at IND."
