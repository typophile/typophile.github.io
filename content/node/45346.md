body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to do some edits to my company's website. The website
  was designed in flash (ActionScript2), but has external .txt files that plug into
  it. I've noticed that certain characters like single and double left/right quotes
  and apostrophes are causing havoc in these .txt files.\r\n\r\nI noticed that some
  of the files use codes for characters such as:\r\n\u201A\xC4\xF4=apostrophe/single
  right quote\r\n\u201A\xC4\xF9=Smart Quotes (or maybe just right quotes)\r\n\r\nI
  can't seem to find what kind of scripting language this is, and couldn't seem to
  find it in the wiki. What is this language? where can I find a chart of character
  codes?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nAndy"

    understands these codes when it loads in external text and should automatically
    convert them.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: This is pretty simple. The quoteright (U+2019) and the quotedblright (U+201D)
    are outside of the Mac OS Roman range. In order to display those characters correctly,
    a text file containing them has to be saved in Unicode (UTF-8). If you then reopen
    such file using the Mac OS Roman encoding, the quotes get replaced by the multiple
    characters you're seeing (in UTF-8, 2019 = E2 + 80 + 99 and 201D = E2 + 80 + 9D)
