I have a question for typophiles: when you see this cartoon, do you place yourself in the cartoon world? Does your brain translate the hand-drawn words with a modern typeface? If so, I'd say your brain is justified, because the context of the whole piece seems to translate a wide range of typefaces into cartoon script. 

But I'm wondering if there are brains out there that work a little differently, and instead interpret the new branding as "from now on, every product will be branded with hand-written letters that look like a child drew them." </div>

All the designers are working so hard to out-design each other that they blow past the basic, minimalist approach. Their attempt to stand out has resulted in a confusing mess in which no one stands out. 

Understandable from a cartoonist who draws mostly stick figures. 

He's [[http://images.google.com/images?q=no+name+brands|not the first to have this idea]], but that's neither here nor there. </div>

It would be fantastic to do a line of products with just the basic name of the product printed in black in Times Roman on a white paper bag or box or can. They would look very suspicious, but certainly eye-catching. Imagine one in the kids' cereal aisle, amidst all the cartoony packages. This is, in fact, an extreme example of the approach taken by healthfood/organic cereals to differentiate themselves from the typical junky cereals. </div>

There's an Amish grocery store I occasionally visit and their store-brand packaging is like that. The photo below (gelatin powder in clear bags) is out of focus but you get the general idea.

This choice however would give a customer no additional information about a product, if it would be premium or cheap, it does not translate an emotion. Interesting question weather or not one can do that solely with typography in this restricted setting. </div>

Yep, I think most folks would assume that bare-bones, generic packaging indicates a product whose main selling point is low price. 

Their assumption might be right or wrong, but I think that's what most folks would think unless they had  a reason to believe otherwise.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The <em>President’s Choice</em> brand (that name wouldn’t fly in the US!) is a Loblaw’s (Canada) house brand.
With close cropped product shots on a white package, and plain all-cap sans type, it has a minimalist look, but not generic or cheap. The discreet logo, the small size of the type and the nice art direction (photographed on white with vignetted shadow) give it sophistication.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pc-appetizers_5133.jpg]

Loblaws still carries the <em>no name</em> brand, so the contrast between all lower case and all caps serves to differentiate the brands, as does the choice of colour, which comes into play much more in this kind of pared-down layout. 

There is also the<em> Blue Menu</em> house brand:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presidents-Choice-Thin-Bagels-300x300_6429.jpg]

Would be even simpler without bilingualism.
