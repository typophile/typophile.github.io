    ALT="purview2"> <BR> <BR>It seems very clunky to me. <BR> <BR>One idea I had was
    to reduce the prominence of the angles on the lower case... I tried it with the
    upper case but at smaller point sizes the 45 degree angles are hard to distinguish
    from curves unless they are as blatant as in these examples.

    This will help it to look less clunky, and help you to evaluate the individual

    Dave&#39;s comments...Because you&#39;re in illustrator, setting up some guide
    lines and snapping to them will give you a consistent baseline. Or use a grid.
    Or when you are done, use the Align tool. <BR> <BR>In Fontographer, manually tighten
    your space bar spacing. It defaults at &#39;1000&#39; which is excessive. <BR>

  body: Thanks BJ! Great help. Here&#39;s a revised font. Note that I still don&#39;t
    have numerals or punctuation. However, I did throw it into fontographer, but haven&#39;t
    had time to kern it properly. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1438.jpg"

    font&#39; and attempt to make it commercial, it&#39;d be wise to investigate others
    that are of the same ilk so that yours is not considered derivative. Check out
    Gridnik and some monoline Identikal fonts &#40;T26&#41; and maybe some others.
