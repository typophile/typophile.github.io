  body: Yves isn&#39;t it a great face. There is a Pharmancy chain here called CVS
    and They use it extensively on their packaging. It reads well in small sizes and
    the numbers are great.

  body: I&#39;m totally with you, Dan. I recently used it as a title and caption  <BR>face
    for a consumer mag, and it works perfectly well in both the  <BR>large titles
    as the petite captions. I coupled it to the friendly and  <BR>soft ITC Mendoza
    Roman and the compact but nevertheless  <BR>extremely readable Solex as text faces.
