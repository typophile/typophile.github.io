  front of me. Since I just moved I am sure it's packed away in a box that will take
  a few days to uncover. I can't remember off hand the proper way to spell out the
  ounce abbreviation. I know AM and PM are small caps, but would oz. be?\r\n\r\nAny
  clarification on this is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn"

  body: No, since it's not an acronym. Opinions might differ on the period, but I'd
    say that since it's a spliced abbreviation (from Italian "onza"), no period is
    necessary. Then again, I don't put a period after Mr or Mrs either.

    it's right."

  body: "I would say lowercase, not smallcaps, and definitely with a period after
    it: oz.\r\n\r\nI recommend Fowler's rule that abbreviations should always have
    a period unless they end in the same letter with which the full word ends. Ergo:\r\n\r\n12
    onza -> 12 oz.\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\nSaint John -> St John"
