body: Hello, I need some help to resolve some situation. <BR> <BR>Some client send
  me a work to do with cyrilic text &#40;Microsoft Word&#41;, and when I open the
  file text the characters are change, the computer don&#39;t reconize this letters.
  This situation was repeted with the Macromedia Freehand. The original file was written
  with Times New Roman and works well with windows XP. I&#39;m using a Mac OS 9.2
  &#40;English Keyboard&#41; at my work but I&#39;m confuse with the origin of the
  problem because Its my first time that I&#39;m use cyrilic text. Did I must change
  the keyboard language? Or I must get a cyrilic version of Times New Roman to Mac
  OS? <BR>thanks for any advice. <BR> <BR>Ricardo

  body: hi Ricardo. WinXp contain unicode opentype version of Times New Roman that
    includes cyrillic too. i&#39;m not expert in mac&#39;n&#39;stuff, but i think
    easyest way - is to convert win&#39;s TNR into mac&#39;s.. <BR> <BR>t80

  body: Ricardo, install the Cyrillic language kit from the MacOS 9 CD. Then you can
    use the &#34;CY&#34; versions of system fonts. If your version of Word is 2000
    or over, the text will open correctly, albeit with a wrong font. Reassign the
    font to any of the &#34;CY&#34; ones, then you can cut and paste to any layout
    application. However, unless you have some professional Cyrrillic fonts &#40;you
    can buy quite a few at <a href="http://www.paratype.ru" target="_blank">www.paratype.ru</a>&#41;,
    you&#39;ll be stuck with these mediocre &#34;CY&#34; system ones.
