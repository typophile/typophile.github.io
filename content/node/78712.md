  of a family of serif fonts I'm doing using a bunch of old (1700-1720) maps I've
  found. Since my first love is antique/fantasy cartography, I've been wanting fonts
  along these lines and haven't been able to find any, so I'm making them. :)\r\n\r\nI
  haven't yet started the kerning; I want to get the glyphs settled first.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I haven't included numerals, because I'm honestly at a loss as to how to make them,
  and I can't imagine wanting to use this font for anything numeric. Does it even
  *need* numbers, do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample_5323.png]\r\n\r\n"

    for numerals, try to do them, they could be handy, especially in maps! ;-)"

    geographic coordinates (43\xB00\u203236\u2033N 83\xB041\u203224\u2033W)\r\nThe
    current letters look great!"

  body: "Great stuff.  Keep the quirkiness, but maybe even out the colour \u2014 S
    and T particularly look different weights here.\r\n\r\nThough I understand what
    you're thinking, slashes usually have the same weight both ways.\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    do numerals if you can.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/fdi-tierra-nueva/\">Tierra

  body: "Oh! thanks for the advice on slashes, Bendy, you can tell I'm new at this
    :) Regarding the S and T, I don't really like the S either, although it's exact
    as far as the reference map is concerned; I'll be trying to rework that one. I
    think the T's major problem might be the fact that it's next to the wonky S, but
    I'll take a second look at that one as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link, Riccard0!
    If I had found that before I started the project, I may just have bought it and
    been done, lol. Now that I've gone through all this, though, I find myself thinking
    I like mine better. Of course, I'm totally biased ;)"
