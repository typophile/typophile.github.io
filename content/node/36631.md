  my final year in school and starting work on the school yearbook. I've been somewhat
  involved with various school magazines/newsletters etcetera over the past few years,
  and one thing which has always seemed lacking is the choice of typeface. Does anyone
  have any suggestions for what typeface to use, for articles, headlines, captions
  and so on? I (as you've probably all guessed) have little experience in typography
  beyond picking from the drop-down list in MSWord, so this whole typography community
  is all a bit intimidating at the moment. How many different fonts should be used
  in any one publication? Should you use the same font for headings as in an article,
  or are there guidelines on which fonts work together well? Any suggestions (or links
  to \"beginners guide to typography\" or similar) would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nmuirgheasa"

    is usually the product of years or school, or professional experience, or both.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    a few handy tips:\r\n<ol><li>Don't use Comic Sans.</li>\r\n<li>Don't use scripts
    in ALL CAPS.</li>\r\n<li>Don't use Old English-stype fonts in ALL CAPS.</li>\r\n<li>Match

  body: Printers that have specialized yearbook divisions can offer a lot of advice
    and even training in yearbook design and production. For example, Friesens, http://www.friesens.com/yearbook/ct/fladefault1.aspx?bhcp=1
    , and there are no doubt many others if you Google (I happen to have used Friesens
    for printing regular trade books).

  body: "I've been thinking more about yearbooks. I was a writer on one many years
    ago, but have never designed one. Yearbooks tend to have a diverse array of content,
    so I would look at the typography as a way of helping to unify the whole thing.
    So, not too many typefaces: a sans serif for captions and sidebar material, a
    serif for longer text, and perhaps a display face for major section titles if
    the serif or sans was not suitable for that purpose. You can set subheads in the
    sans when using the serif for text, or use the serif in a larger size, a semi-bold,
    or italic. Be consistent throughout whatever you do.\r\n\r\nAs to specific typefaces,
    that depends on the desired tone of the publication---is it to be serious, casual,
    artsy, funky ... Perhaps if you tell us a bit more about your yearbook, we can
    suggest some possible typefaces and combinations."

  body: "Thanks for the replies. I realise that I'm not going to develop a well developed
    typesense in between final year studying and actually designing this thing, but
    nonetheless I'm hoping that I can, with a bit of help, come up with a small selection
    of fonts to use which are aesthetically better than Times New Roman, but which
    are equally legible and, hopefully, can help tie the whole thing together. \r\n\r\nWe're
    using a program called Scribus for the design, which is another issue I hadn't
    previously even considered; scribus is appareantly quite fussy about using low
    quality fonts, and won't approximate Italics, Bold etc. I don't know how much
    experience anyone on here has working with scribus (or if you've even heard of
    it), but as I say it's appareantly quite fussy with what fonts will work with
    it.\r\n\r\nAs for the look of the book, we're going after a light, informal design,
    with a lot of photos and (relatively speaking) not a huge amount of text (although
    there will be things like the principal's foreword and maybe one or two articles
    on other things as well). So I suppose a fairly major issue is what type of font
    to use for captions. Is it generally advisable to use the same font as you use
    for body text, or are there any rules of thumb for that sort of thing at all?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\n\r\nmuirgheasa"

  body: "Hi there, back when I was in High School I was the editor the our yearbook
    2 years in a row. The company we dealt with had a restriction on the fonts we
    could use (no idea of the reason now) so you should look into that just in case.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinion
    is a good alternative to Times New Roman. But you know there's no rule you -have-
    to use a serif for the body copy. Esp if it's shorter. Since you have limited
    experience and the will make everything look good (which is awesome. We cared
    more about putting more pictures of the grads in the yearbook as opposed to good
    design) I would try and stick with as few fonts as possible. Why don't you use
    News Gothic predominately and then some display faces for headlines. Maybe Rockwell
    or something.  \r\n\r\nGood luck!"
