  whether it's possible to say what kind of fonts they were using back then. It's
  not too easy to find out: were they using big machines such as Linotypes? \r\n\r\nI
  also wonder about the relationship between Clarendon Press and the Clarendon Font,
  particularly for 1926 (because the word Clarendon seems to be related mostly to
  19th century fonts). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fowler-900_4199.png]"

    shown in _Type for Books_, The Bodley Head for MacKays, 1959. \r\nFor a digital
    version see http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/scotch-roman-mt/\r\nThere is also
    a digital revival with many extra features of an earlier version by Nick Shinn
    under the name Scotch Modern http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/
    Note the single story italic _g_ in Scotch Modern.\r\nDon"

    to explore. I found [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2007/02/scotch-roman.html|this]]
    site almost immediately. From the article:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFounts for five
    sizes of these types from Pica to Brevier (12 to 8 point) were bought from Miller
    & Richard in 1901 by the University Press at Oxford, where the type, as shown
    above, was known as Dryden. The same sizes were in due course marketed by Miller
    & Richard under the name of \u2018Old Roman\u2019. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThanks
    Don!"

    typefaces, if you were also interested in that. Monotype has a good selection
    of Latin fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
