body: I am close to having some letters to post for a critique, but just as a general
  question on ITALICS. How do you create Italics while retaining the character of
  the roman...leaving the impression of it being in the same family?

  body: This depends a lot on what class of type it is and its intended usage(s).
    Each class has different numbers of, and kinds of, stylistic tendrils that reach
    between the two...post visuals and it'll be easier to see.

  body: "It also depends on whether you wish your face to be informed by writing and
    typographic tradition or just a variant to be used for emphasis. In this situation,
    you can theoretically invent anything you want, provided it has visual consistence
    with the \"Roman\".\r\nThis could go for any language's Script, I think, as long
    as you are willing to experiment instead of applying common rules.\r\n\r\nIf you
    are interested in serious text type, just post a sample and follow David Berlow's
    advice. Don't lose the opportunity."

  body: "Actually, there are no general rules for roman and italic.\r\nMany historic
    typefaces had no italics and either italics created later or the roman was matched
    with an existing italic.\r\n\r\nThe general trend for the last fifty years is
    to design a complementary italic for each roman weight.\r\n\r\nIf your design
    is a true text type, then you have some options based on the nature of the design.
    You neglected to mention a type classification for our reference.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    the italic weights can rival the roman version. I always felt Matthew Carter's
    ITC Galliard italics were truly outstanding.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts to ponder.\r\n\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"

  body: "The face I'm working on is, I hope, an old style serif. Def. a text face,
    might do a display later, if I have time.\r\n\r\nI was really wondering about
    how you carry over those attributes. ( Guarding face ) It just seems italics on
    most roman faces dont vary that much...\r\n\r\n?"

  body: "If you are designing an old style typeface, it depends on what your intent
    is and what applications the face is more suitable for.\r\n\r\nIf the design is
    primarily for book publication and lengthy text, you might try a more traditional
    approach. It always helps to do a little research on how some of the best type
    designers resolved the same problem.\r\n\r\nFor traditional book face examples,
    review these famous versions of Garamond:\r\n\r\nStempel Garamond\u2122 from Linotype\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1500/stempelgaramond-family.html\r\nPlease
    make sure to read the descriptive text below the samples as it illustrates how
    many source specimens and how many iterations a design can go through.\r\n\r\nBerthold
    Garamond\r\nhttp://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90076.html\r\nIf you want
    to review the full character complement and text samples, download the Old Style
    pdf samples from their home page: http://www.bertholdtypes.com/home.html\r\n\r\nThese
    specimens will clearly illustrate how the italic cuts can differ and how the character
    shapes and widths complement the roman.\r\n\r\nIf you are taking a more contemporay
    approach and feel your design is better suited for advertising, brochures, medium
    to short text applications, try looking at ITC Garamond.\r\n\r\nITC Garamond (from
    Linotype)\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/664/itcgaramond-family.html\r\nAgain, read
    the descriptive material below the samples. It illustrates how intended use will
    greatly affect your design decisions.\r\n\r\nOf course the final decision on how
    to approach the italics is up to you. You may be able to take a more innovative
    approach and perhaps give the type world something fresh and exciting.\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
