  designer that specialises in band logos, or more specifically rock/metal band logos.  I
  have found many sites but they tend to specialise in corporate logos. <BR> <BR>Can
  anybody recommend a website, or contact of somebody who can help me??  I am a paying
  client, and I&#39;m not looking for anything too complex.  Is there anyone out there???
