  me if I say/ask something stupid ... anyway, here is my question.\r\n\r\nSuppose
  I need to display single digit numbers for a very short time (<1 s) on a good quality
  digital screen ( say, like an ipad screen ); sizes are fixed ( or slowly varying
  wrt other motions ) but the digits could be subject to geometrical continuously
  varying transformations while displayed ( like rotations, stretchings, ... ). What
  is the best font to maximize the ability of the viewer of recognizing the number
  ?"

    lining figures would depend on the context; for isolated digits, lining might
    be better."

      are you looking for? What's the feel you're going for?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nthis
      is something I may decide later; the readability issue is my primary concern
      now in the sense that any non-readable solution would be unacceptable.\r\n\r\nYes,
      they are isolated 0-9 digits; just to give you something to picture in your
      mind, consider a single digit \"flying\" around on an empty screen like if it
      were thrown on screen from a randomish angle from the outside, following a physical
      ( hence possibly rotating, 3d ) motion.\r\n\r\nNow, the problem is that ambiguous
      digits like 6 vs 9 ( so some kind of visual aid is needed, like an \"underscore\"
      fixing the orientation ( sorry, I don't know the technical term :) ) ), those
      resembing each other like 1 and 7, or those resembing each other when \"spinning\"
      like 0 and 8, 3 and 5 etc ... can make digit recognition hard. Is there some
      \"general purpose\" typographic trickery to minimize these sort of effects ?\r\n"

    example), I'd apply it to all numbers for consistency. \r\n\r\nI would think that

  body: "\"this is something I may decide later\"\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there
    are legible typefaces in many different styles (or at least serif and sans). Finding
    an easily legible font is not the problem. You need to decide what feel you want
    first in order to narrow down the selection.\r\n\r\nYour approach, with all due
    respect, is a bit like painting a room and going to the paint store and asking
    which paints are the most durable (or whatever) before you've chosen a color.
    You want to be asking \"which <em>orange</em> paint is the most durable\" \u2026
    or whatever. Make sense?"

  body: "<blockquote>Your approach, with all due respect, is a bit like[...]Make sense?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    understand your point and I would agree with you in most cases, but IMHO this
    is a different story. The problem is not legibility in a general sense, it's the
    specific requirement of designing digits to be recognizable ( not comfortably
    readable and/or estethically pleasing ) while moving/rotating.\r\n\r\nImagine
    a NASA engineer asking you to design digits for zero-gravity labels ( say, in
    the international space station ) optimized to allow astronauts to \"grasp\" numbers
    even if upside down, or while rotating in mid air... would you really ask him
    first the \"feel\" of the typeface ?\r\n\r\nfollowing your example, if the painting
    durability were my primary requirement then its color would be an irrilevant decision.
    Just to give you a concrete example, do you know those paintings used to protect
    the hull of boats from marine vegetation ? ideally, one would like to match the
    color to the main hull color, but sometimes this is not possible because some
    active ingredients in the painting already act as a pigment ... so, asking \"which
    orange paint is the most durable\" would just make them laugh at you in this case
    :)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I would think that any font that is very legible should

    I will end up designing them from the ground up; after all, it should be just
    10 isolated symbols in 2-3 different sizes ( eventually, I'll come back here if
    I have problems ) ... just hoped someone already did it for me :), thanks"

  body: "<blockquote>If people have trouble reading it, adjust the timing to slow

    but still unoptimal; essentially, the timing and the \"trouble\" in recognizing
    numbers are part of the game mechanics, and the problem is exactly to trick the
    player without annoying him too much ( and confusing 6/9, or 1/7 happens to be
    annoying ) while preserving a \"sophisticated\" graphical touch. It's a perfectionism
    thing ...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Pick a legible font that fits the style of the game.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nsure,
    but the converse may work too, ie fit the game style to the type face instead,
    as long as it's worth it, of course.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Therefore, it is necessary
    to place an underline beneath all figures, or use a device which treats top and
    bottom of glyphs differently, such as \u201Ctop-heavy\u201D or color.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI've
    already experimented with the \"top-heavy\" idea but I always ends up with either
    an inelegant \"fat effect\" or a pompous feel ( like a perspective deformation
    of some heavy-tall-column ) or some other \"exaggerated\" effect.\r\n\r\nthe underscore
    is easy ( and it's my current solution, by the way ) but it gives an \"engineer\"-like
    feeling. This is not bad per se, indeed I can always give to the overall style
    a more \"technical\" touch instead.\r\n\r\nas already said, I need some more experimentation
    ... thank you everybody !\r\n"
