  body: "I don\u2019t think that expecting potential clients to download a twelve
    megabyte PDF from a slow server is a good idea; in the time it took me to download
    that PDF I could have perused the entire online portfolios of several other design
    firms. And keep in mind that in some large corporations employees are sitting
    behind a firewall that won\u2019t let them download a PDF.  You should put a phone
    number and address in the contact section\u2014there are plenty of people out
    there who don\u2019t want to hire someone via email. And fix the text on the THANKYOU
    page, you used \u201Cyour\u201D instead of \u201Cyou\u2019re\u201D"
