  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding a typography quiz that I recently took for my class:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>A type family is the complete range of variations of a typeface design, including roman, italic and bold. A type family is also used to describe the 5 basic font families (sans serif, serif, cursive, monospace, and fantasy) that are used to define fonts on the Web.</li>
</ol>
<p>I answered this as false, but the professor says it&rsquo;s actually true.  Can someone please explain this to me?  I&rsquo;m a bit confused with this one&hellip;</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,
PG</p>

The CSS Specification does include a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#generic-font-families">font-family</a>&rdquo; property with generic values of serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy and monospace. But font-family and type family (aka. typeface family or font family) are not nearly the same and has little to do with typography.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone use the cursive or fantasy values.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A type family doesn&rsquo;t just include the typeface (ie Times) but also includes the type style within that typeface (ie Times italics, Times bold etc). A type family can also be classified as a san serif type family (ie. Arial, Verdana etc) or a serif type family (ie. Times, Georgia etc). They are groupings of some commonality, depending on its criteria.&rdquo;</p>

Sounds to me like your teacher was hoping to throw everyone off by including words such as cursive and fantasy. The trouble is the wording: <cite>A type family is also used to describe&hellip;</cite> It&rsquo;s not commonly used to describe collections of cohesive yet widely varying typefaces, much less groupings of serif faces such as Times and Georgia.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In her response to your e-mail, she throws in classification, which doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with what constitutes a family. Apples and oranges. And as you suspect, she&rsquo;s not really answering your question.</p>
<p>Even her first sentence, in which she does try to address your question (<em>A type family doesn’t just include the typeface (ie Times) but also includes the type style within that typeface (ie Times italics, Times bold etc)</em>) is worded in a confusing way.</p>
<p>The thing about the test question is that it&rsquo;s a little tricky &ndash; if you answer &ldquo;False&rdquo; to the second part of the question, you are also saying that the first part is false! But you aren&rsquo;t allowed to explain that difference in your answer&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I emailed her again to ask for further clarification, and she sent me the following in an email reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Font family is the different styles within one font (ie. Times italics, Times bold etc). Type family really depends on how you want to group the type. For example, I want to have a group (or family) of san serif type, so that can be Georgia, Verdana and Arial. Type family has a larger definition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also researched this before writing to her, and every publication I came across says the correct answer is false.  It sucks because I lose ten points now, on my quiz as a result of this question&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t want her to feel as if I&rsquo;m somehow being pushy (even though I should be, as this is not the grade that I deserve).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just make a mental note of what the correct answer really is.  Although, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll never forget this one&hellip;  Thanks everyone.  :0(</p>
