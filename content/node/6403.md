  designed by great female typographers. <BR> <BR>Many thanks in advance! <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: Right. Anything from Gundrun Zapf-von-Hesse. <BR> <BR>&#40;In Berlin, Frere-Jones
    said he had no idea how to maka a typeface masculine or feminine

  body: Part of the problem with this question is that it is highly subjective. In
    some ways, those typefaces with a bent towards the humanist are feminine and those
    that are bent towards geometric are masculine. Oh wait, what about grotesk. Perhaps
    Grotesk can fall in between, switch hitters so-to-speak depending upon how they
    are used. But then again all three styles could be either or depending upon how
    they are used. And what of typefaces like Meta? <BR> <BR>Metro, Gill, Parisine
    &#40;Clair&#41; --&#62; More Feminine <BR>Futura, Gotham,

  body: In my opinion the epitome of femininity is script &#40;IMO!&#41; And Jill
    Bell a big name in type deisgn and I find many of her types to have a strong feminine
    flourish. <BR>Also not designed by a woman... but i have always felt that Gill&#39;s
    Joanna is a very feminine face, if you need something for text... or there&#39;s
    ITC&#39;s Leawood....

  body: Linotype&#39;s new Pirouette and Samba are both very femine-looking, IMO,
    although they were both designed by men. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-23-6-17051/pirouette.html"

    <BR> <BR>In fact, if we want to cross-reference with the Women in Type thread
    running in General Discussions right now, I think that most of the ITDC 2003&#39;s
    winning fonts&#42; look femine
