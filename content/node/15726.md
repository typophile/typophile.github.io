body: "I couldn't find the previous thread, so I started a new one.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting
  for my Bringhurst to arrive in the mail, I have put one of the sections onto the
  baseline grid and changed the typeface. I am using Warnock Pro for the text body
  and Trebuchet for headers and side notes.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any comments
  on these changes, in particular: \r\nDo these two typefaces work well together?
  (I find it looks fresh and clear.) \r\nIs the 8pt size too small? (I think it's
  fine, but I don't wear glasses...)\r\n\r\n*Please ignore the first page of the pdf.*
  \r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\nKristina"

    please disregard the first page as it is only a listing and will not appear like

  body: Very nice separation of information. I would suggest shifting the entire grid
    to the right (or the outside) so your margins on left and right (inside and outside)
    are assymetrical or rather balanced on the top, bottom and right (outside). I
    might also suggest using a different sans, but at least make it bold for more
    contrast.

  body: "Thank you, Miss Tiffany.\r\nI'm still working on it and will come back with
    some more changes.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention that the book is actually trimmed
    narrower. If I understand your suggestion about shifting the grid to the right
    correctly, it is already like that, just doesn't show that way in the pdf. :/
    \ The right margin is only .6 in or so. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nK."

  body: "On the pages where you use a single column, the measure is on the wide side,
    to assist separation of paragraphs you might try an indent on paragraphs after
    the first of a section(there is a section on Degree Requirements that uses line
    space after). Also there are several single words on the last line which would
    look better if you take over words from preceding lines. But overall this is a
    vast improvement over the Word sample you showed earlier, especially the two column
    work.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thank you for the encouragement, Tim.\r\n\r\nI find it's better with everything
    on the grid, but also a little tougher to make things fit -- ensuring that course
    titles aren't separated from descriptions, for example. I can't edit the content
    at all -- so can only squeeze stuff in or space it out. I'm finding some pages
    really tricky to fit.\r\n\r\nYes, I've been toying with using indents for every
    paragraph after the first. I never understood why it was set up this way to begin
    with, but figured there had to be a reason... Even a small indent would do a lot
    for clarity, I'm sure. Then line spaces to distinguish between major topics.  \r\n\r\nThanks
    again, I appreciate the help.\r\nK."
