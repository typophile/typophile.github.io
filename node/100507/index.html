Questioning the quality of resolution and color on a typographic forum is not bitching.
400 dpi is not high resolution for type.
I always like to see the impression that metal type makes, and the ink gain, and can never get enough res.
One doesn’t have to be a “literal revivalist” to want that.

Of course, it would be too many megabites <em>now</em> to scan the whole catalog at “super high res”, but if the internet is to present a simulacrum of the real object, some artefacts must be shown, say a few pages, in higher resolution, and perhaps in oblique views revealing depth, or even in 3D.

One day, thanks to Moore’s Law, this sort of zoom in will be possible:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_foot_4119.jpg]
(This image from a $50, 10mp camera.)

As an aside, scanning a 35 mm color slide on a transparency scanner ($150 scanner, 9600 dpi), you can get down to the ﬁlm grain. Accordingly, I calculate the 35 mm recorded image as around 15 megapixels.

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm, well it turns out it's not <em>effectively</em> 400dpi (which to me is decent resolution for anything but "forensic type design") because they seem to have used the lowest possible JPEG quality - here's a screengrab for people who don't want to bother downloading the very large files:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1923_3867.jpg]

It <em>is</em> pretty blurry... Now, this doesn't make it useless*: it still does an acceptable job giving a feeling of what the book -and the era- was about; and people can certainly find plenty of forms and ideas to be inspired by. And really, you can't complain about a no-strings-attached gift.

* BTW Nick, I love looking super close at things like ink gain too, but that's not really what's worthwhile about that ATF specimen book.

Over the past little while I have irrefutably proven that when it comes to digital photography = cash in the bank ... it's all about quality not quantity.  I picked up a cheapo A630 (capable of only 8mp) and a 19teen something manual typewriter all for less than 50 bucks. I then applied all my inbred talents to produce some incredible imagery which I then sold as high end prints!!  So far I have turned 8 mp imagery (plus a 5ive dollar typewriter) into just over 2k ...and still counting... :)

When it comes to technology = earned cash ... for the digital artist/craftsman it's all about quality not quantity.

Point being that with the right amount of skill plus your own talent(s) you can realize a handsome return on a minimal investment.

<strong>Help me out.</strong> A digital copy of a digital original is an exact duplicate. A scan of anything—theoretically—can never be as good as the original. If the hi-res PDF is viewed <em>at the same size</em> as the original book, how much difference is there to someone with normal and unaided vision? 

To those who bemoan the lack of resolution, what magnification would you take to the <strong><em>book</em></strong>? 10X, 30X, 100X, 1000X? How big an enlargement is too big, assuming for typographical purposes, and not to sell 24" X 24" prints?

Are we talking perfection and theory here or something practical?</div>

As I alluded, the usefulness of a scan depends on the user's intentions. This PDF is fine for some things, just not making faithful revivals (which might very well be a feature and not a bug :-) or seeing delicate details of craftsmanship (which is sad).

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, I don’t have a copy of this particular specimen book.
This new online project is of absolutely no use to me.
And yet surely I represent the kind of person that would be interested in an historical type specimen book.
I have been all over the internet looking at scans of old typography, and there is NEVER ENOUGH RES!
I’m not satisﬁed with admiring page layouts, as a typophile—a connoisseur  of type—I want to see those delicate details of craftsmanship (both founding and printing) that Hrant refers to. That’s the <em>sine qua non</em> of letterpress.
I don’t think it’s too much to ask for bigger ﬁles—after all, people are downloading gigabytes of movies—and this is surely the trend. So I say to those altruists who scan and post, get with the tour!

In the meantime, I will continue to collect original historical documents, or reference material with ultra-high resolution photographic reproductions printed by gravure, such as <em>The Art & History of Books</em> by Norma Levarie:
http://www.alibris.com/booksearch.detail?invid=10024732733&qwork=425630&qsort=&page=1
(This is the 1968 edition which I refer to, I don’t know how good the reproductions are in subsequent editions.)
Online scans have to be better than those in this book, which has the advantage of being printed on paper, the reﬂective medium of the originals, and thus has that quality of facsimile authenticity which online resources don’t have—unless one can print out a page from a digital scan at comparable resolution, but that’s a tall order.</div>

<em>there is NEVER ENOUGH RES!</em>

I seems as though you want more res than the original designers ever had or were capable of. (Or am I wrong about that?)

If you could have pristine glyphs that were literally ten feet high is that good enough? What would you do with them?

When I first became interested in typography, I intensely scrutinized letterforms. I often disliked idiosyncrasies, I loved certain glyphs in particular fonts, etc. It took me a while to learn about the color and density and kerning and readability and legibility of a typeface.

<em>I’m not satisﬁed with admiring page layouts, as a typophile—a connoisseur of type—I want to see those delicate details of craftsmanship (both founding and printing) that Hrant refers to. That’s the sine qua non of letterpress.</em>

No argument here. But for the most part, letterpress is gone. And "those delicate details of craftsmanship" (I don't think) attest to color or readability. When you make a font, how big are the glyphs—either as sketches on paper or on screen?

Then there is the work of the press man.
Those are connected.
One has to see how the metal bites into the paper, and how the ink is deposited.
The letters were designed with that in mind.
So how can one understand an historical type design without intimately observing this three-dimensional physical process?

The machining tolerances for Linotype design and manufacture were down to one quarter of 1/1,000th of an inch. Presumably they could measure that precisely as well. By my calculation, that would be equivalent to a resolution of 4,000 ppi.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GriffithExamining_4889.jpg]<br><em>C.H. Griffith examining a type proof.</em>


The type production drawings were done at a scale of approximately 10 inches high. For a 10-pt type, that would be equivalent to zooming in to around 7200%.

Note that the sidebearings here differ by 0.00025 inches. That would be the equivalent of 1.8 em units in a digital font with a 1000 UPM.</div>

It's possible that in the future something like that might actually be possible. They are already working on screens that can change shape to make clickable buttons. It's not the pixels that are moving, but who knows what might be possible someday.

Hey: among the stuff that I donated to the Albert and Shirley Smalls Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia is a duplicate copy of the ATF 1923 specimen book, all beat up to hell (because it was SERIOUSLY used in a working print shop, I suspect). What am I bid? Or, for that matter, it turns out i had THREE copies of the Barnhart Brother & Spindler Catalog #25. I’ve promised one to Luc Devroye; should I donate the third copy to the Library of Congress (they have only one copy, so it’s housed in the Rare Books room), or does someone want to flash a lot of cash my way?

Thank you for a meaningful and informative contribution to this discussion.

I still think that someone interested in performing a type revival would have the data he needs from the specimen book as it is provided, even if it will mean a little more work.

Incidentally, some data in <em>Typographical Printing-Surfaces</em> by Legros and Grant suggests that foundry types were usually designed so that their widths would be multiples of 1/4 or 1/8 of a point. This suggests that a higher-res scan at some multiple of 576 dpi would potentially have extra usefulness.

To adjust for the fact that a printer's point is not exactly 1/72 inch, make that 578 dpi, if practical.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, if one is using a camera, one can control its distance from the source material. As well, while sensors have a fixed spacing, the time intervals between when they are read during scanning can sometimes be controlled flexibly, giving one near-unlimited choice of resolution in one direction.

As it happens, 0.0081734 mm, or 1/3107.6 of an inch, is very nearly exactly 1/43 of a point and 1/46 of a Didot point, making it a nearly ideal standard scanning resolution for both Continental and British/American type specimen books both.

Rumor has it that these were Matthew Carter’s brass rules. (From the collection of the Museum of Printing in North Andover, MA.)

I used a 10× loupe on 10 pt. type when I was working on my Scotch Modern revival.
I needed to look that closely, because I was trying to make a font that would create a facsimile, with today’s high-res offset lithography, of mid 19th century high-res letterpress printing. The amount of press gain is quite different now, and works differently on different parts of the letter than it did back then. I needed to see the variations in hairline and serif thicknesses in the original, closely, and how much of that was in the metal and how much the result of ink gain, in order to understand the structure and function of that type design and thus enable an accurate simulacrum.

One of the things I discovered in the Scotch Modern project was that facsimile revivals, with their antiquarian ﬂavour, are an abstruse taste. Bembo has a broader appeal and usefulness than Poliphilus.

So you are correct John, that there is enough information in these ATF PDFs for “a type revival”, if not for facsimile quality.</div>
