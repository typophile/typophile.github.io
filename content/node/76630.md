  Lois.\" The quotation reads  [[http://typographyshop.com/george_lois_creative_act_mens_t-shirt.html|The
  creative act, the defeat of habit by originality, overcomes everything.]] When I
  first approached George about collaborating, this was his immediate suggestion and
  remains one of his more celebrated statements.\r\n\r\nMy favorite quote of his,
  \"[[http://typographyshop.com/george_lois_great_ideas_mens_t-shirt.html|Great ideas
  can't be tested. Only mediocre ideas can be tested]]\" was the first release in
  the series. \r\n\r\nA portion of the proceeds from sales of this shirt will benefit
  the Herschel Levit scholarship fund at Pratt Institute, Mr. Lois' alma mater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_loiscreativeact_4487.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_lois_great_ideas_5691.jpg]"
