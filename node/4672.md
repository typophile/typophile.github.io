body: Hello, <BR>This is my first post at Typophile, I&#39;ve been lurking for awhile
  and am glad I finally signed-up. <BR>I have attempted designing a few typefaces
  in the past 2-3 years while studying graphic design. I wanted some feedback on this
  geometric sans I came up with &#40;lowercase only&#41; about 6 months ago.    <BR>Thanks
  for any critiques...
