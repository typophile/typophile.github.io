  body: "Dear signs79,\r\n\r\nYou are barraging us with a lot of mysterious type samples,
    sending some of us scurrying on hunts for these typefaces. You send them out with
    great rapidity, but no helpful information. \r\n\r\nWhere did these come from?
    How old are they? Do you have any other samples showing the same typefaces?\r\n\r\nPlease
    consider the amount of  work you are having done for you, and see if there is
    anything you can do to make our searches easier. Don't you think that's a fair
    request?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "They are just simply typefaces from design firms that I have been browsing
    on the internet. I don't know what a certain font is and it drives my nuts!!!
    I have the Indie Fonts book, T26, FF, and Hoefler catalogs and if I can't find
    it in those- I post it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help."

  body: Signs - you could try asking the design firms themselves what fonts they use,
    most will probably be happy to help you.

    used. I will send them an email and say I really like the logo and then ask if
    they wouldn't mind telling which typeface they used.\r\n\r\nIt's never worked.
    I gave up on that awhile back."

    version of Perpetua Expert. I was JUST reading about it and then saw this forum.

  body: I could see a resemblance to Perpetua when it was first posted (especially
    the R, but also the overall proportions), but I thought it was just my imagination.
