  body: You can't --  the substitution fonts automatically kick in when the fonts
    the text originally was set in is missing. Why would you want to use the substitution
    font?

  body: "I don't... I need to figure out what the font is that was used for this and
    use it on a rebrand. So if you can't use a substitution font, whoever used this
    must have used something else, right? Man, who'd a thought this would be so difficult.
    I appreciate all the help, hopefully we can all fugure this thing out.\r\n\r\nHere's
    the deal...\r\n\r\nWe have been contracted to do a rebrand for these guys:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AZDC.gif]\r\n\r\nThey
    want to use the same font, but change the logo, colors, etc... so I am trying
    to figure out what the font is so we can use it in the rebrand. Of course they
    have no idea what was used or who even did it so I figured I'd try posting on
    here. As usual, any and all help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nBeau"

  body: "WILD GUESS: To gain access to the Adobe Substitution fonts, you can typeset
    the words you need with a similar typeface but don't embed the fonts into the
    PDF. Close the font. Open the file into acrobat. If it looks right, and you have
    Acrobat Pro, Go to pull-down: TOOLS>PRINT PRODUCTION>PDF OPTIMIZER. Under TRANSPARENCY,
    \"turn all type to outlines.\" It will then ask you to save the file again.\r\n\r\nIf
    this works or doesn't work could you report back? I'd be curious/surpised.\r\n\r\nAlthough,
    this doesn't look spindly enough to be the Adobe fonts."

    Vision</a> publication. In both files, the type on the logos is converted to curves,
    so looks like the logo is "as is".

  body: The logo file they gave me is an eps converted all to curves, so ... yeah
    ... I have no idea what the font is. I just have a hard time believing that someone
    converted the logo from a substitute font. I don't think that would be possible.
    Would it?

    it is possible to convert Adobe Sans and Adobe Serif to outlines.\r\n\r\nWell,
    since they want a rebrand, try to convince them that they have to change the typeface
    too."

    on "Adobe Serif"

  body: "I agree... Though not a fan of Papyrus at all.\r\n\r\nOkay, let's change
    the focus here since we all agree that the use of Adobe Serif is just stupid.
    Anyone up for a good recommendation of a new face for their brand? I will do all
    I can to pull them away from the current face. Maybe we can find something that
    will be close but better.\r\n\r\nHere's what I would like you to take into consideration,
    the font will be used for logos, text, web & video - basically everything.\r\n\r\nI
    think Times Europa is a bit \"fat\" with some of it's characters. Plus I think
    we would want to have more of a friendly feel to the font. Times tends to be a
    bit stuck up (in my opinion). Maybe there would be a good semi-serif?\r\n\r\nThoughts?"
