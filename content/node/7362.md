body: Lately I&#39;ve been needing to check a lot of versions of a recently made type
  family.  <BR>I used for that Contour Master by DTL and was very accurate and fast.
  The program checks in batch process all the fonts at the same time and gives a report
  in detail of all the possible problems for every character. <BR>Far better than
  the messy Font Audit in which you have to go letter by letter, point by point cheking
  what is happening. <BR>With Contour Master you can read the reports and to know
  very fast if they are serious overlapping or just a bezier not very well adjusted.
  I less than half an hour I had all the serious mistakes solved.
