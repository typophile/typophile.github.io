  the name painted on the stern of a boat (sorry for the image quality, I don't have
  access to the boat to take another). I'm pretty sure the font was found for free
  online, but I don't know its name. The general look is (if I understand the terms
  correctly) western-style, with serifs and pointy doodads at the midline, and the
  top half is outline while the lower half is solid. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Good suggestion! I now know the doodads are "midline spurs" and the half-filled
    look is called "two-tone". No luck finding the exact font yet, though.
