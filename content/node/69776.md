  interpretation of the classic design from fonts \u201CBernhardSchoenschrift\u201D,
  originally designed by Lucien Bernhard and \u201CLiberty\u201D, designed by W.T.
  Sniffin for ATF in 1927, following the original designs from Lucien Bernhard.\r\n\r\nThis
  enhanced OpenType version has complete sets in Greek and Latin alphabet with Central
  European, Vietnamese, Baltic and Turkish complete resources with all diacritic signs
  and punctuation marks plus extra characters belonging this ranges. \r\n\r\nA Cyrillic
  alphabet completes the font, and we thanks to Dmitry Greshnev from Green Type. He
  help us to fix our original Cyrillic alphabet to the Cyrillic readers.\r\n\r\nWe
  added a extensive set of ligatures (stylistic and contextual alternates plus discretionary
  ligatures) providing a lot of letterform variations that make your design really
  special, plus swashes and tails ornaments (to artistic increase any letter of this
  font) more fractions and number ligatures (a strange idea from Iza W). Over 800
  glyphs.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Intellecta_Design/?sort=new\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/reliant/"

  body: "Reliant: Umlaut/dieresis dots are too thick compared with i-dot and somewhat
    misplaced (too much to the left). Uppercase G hangs in mid-air, and germandbls
    (\xDF) is too thin. Uppercase characters are generally too thin compared with
    lowercase. Similar catastrophy with Greek charset (http://origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/78/0/40031.png):
    gamma, kappa, epsilon, chi, ypsilon, lambda, beta (looks like a germandbls). \r\n\r\nSorry
    to say so but this looks like from a 1000-professional-fonts-for-20-bucks CD.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Paulo,\r\nI like the whole project idea, but there are several problems:\r\n<strong>1</strong>.
    All uppercases are too thin. They don't match lowercases properly.\r\n<strong>2</strong>.
    There are many vector flaws and bumps. Curves needs corrections.\r\n<strong>3</strong>.
    Terminals are not normalized and doesn't follow a calligraphic flow.\r\n<strong>4</strong>.
    Diacritics are misplaced. Andreas tested umlaut, but this also occurs with tilde,
    acute, ring and circumflex. Cedilla curve touchs the character base. Circumflex
    is heavy and conflicts with the font contrast. Slash in \xF8 seems a f without
    bar. Ogonek is also misplaced.\r\nI'm also unsure if fractions like 4/6 or 8/2
    must be included in a font.\r\nThe flourish over /l/ is very good.\r\nA complex
    project like this, with extensive language support, would benefit a lot when submitted
    to the 'Critique' section before its release."

  body: Thanks Andreas, I will make corrections with your suggestions. While I was
    designing Reliant I was searching for opinions of designers to help me, because
    I never was designed before in non-latin characters. Unfortunally, all critique
    comes ever after the work finished, off course.

    in a update work now. Unfortunally I starts contact in this forum when the font
    was finished. In the next projects I will launch in the begginings the post here. '

  body: They don't share the same design. Although it's a script, it's clearly a regular
    one. So there is no reason to use different terminals (compare bottom right terminal
    in /a/l/x/).
