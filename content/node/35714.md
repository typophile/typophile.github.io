  But what is the one that is in all caps? Check out the capital e. It\u2019s like
  a lowercase e. It\u2019s pretty, right? but what is the font called?? Thanks!!!

  body: The script's true name is Polonaisse designed by Phil Martin of Alphabest
    Inovations. But the copying of the font and changing the name is a common practice.

  body: Filosofia Unicase Regular. To me it looks like the caps in the photo are just
    resized. There isn't a small caps version done in unicase to my knowledge.

  body: "<em>To me it looks like the caps in the photo are just resized.</em>\r\n\r\nWell,
    it could be <a href=\"http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/alpha.htm\"><strong>Paul Baker's
    digital version</strong></a> of <a href=\"http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/bradbury-thompson-alphabet-26\"><strong>Bradbury
    Thompson's Alphabet 26</strong></a>... Baker's version uses an uppercase <strong>G</strong>,
    like in the invitation (Thompson's had a lowercase <strong>g</strong>), and has
    a set of caps.\r\n\r\nThen again, fontplayer has already posted a link to Bodoni
    26, which is another version of the same face, and it, too, has a set of caps
    (and an uppercase <strong>G</strong>).\r\n\r\nOne more thing, this thread belongs
    in the Type ID Board.  :-)"

    If any typophile member is one of the \"hurrumphs\", I hope you do not take offense
    at my flippant generalization. In retrospect, anyone voting for that font can't
    be too terribly hurrumphish.\r\n; )"
