body: "I would be grateful for suggestions of a classic typeface with a significant
  uppercase (swirly) L\r\n\r\nI was going to use Garamond Alternate Italic for a book
  cover. But I have noticed that an organization - dealing with the same subject as
  the book is about - uses the Garamond Alternate uppercase L in their logo"
