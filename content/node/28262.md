body: "I'm currently putting together a special order form my family-owned Travel
  Mug business.\r\n\r\nThe form will be next to our mugs in all of our locations.
  \ \r\n\r\nHere are the stats for the form:  Letter-sized, portrait, color.  Heading
  across the top and one large picture of one of our mugs taking up the entire left
  side, and the order information on the right.\r\n\r\nThe heading is the thing I
  need help with.  What I have so far is \"Get any of our mugs personalized with your
  name\"  but I want to <em>emphasize</em> that anyone could put their logo or organization's
  name, anything they want, granted it isn't copywritten.  \r\n\r\nAny help would
  be great, editorializing is welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks for all of your help."

  body: this slightly repeats Dan's suggestion, and I don't know if it's a colloquialism,
    but how about something along the lines of "Get your mug on a mug"?

  body: "Yeah cool,\r\n\r\nI can't believe you took my suggestion ha ha! :)\r\nBut..the
    original was 'try coffee on the inside, go nuts on the outside' I think it works
    a bit better because the two halves match: they're both suggestions to do something;
    try coffee, go nuts and the wordplay is a bit more obvious. \r\n\r\nAlso I don't
    think you need the craziness in the typeface as the joke is in the words themselves,
    if you use a straightfaced type face (something like this: <a href= \"http://www.linotype.com/996/linotypecentennial-family.html>
    linotype centennial </a> type in your text on the right hand side) it delays the
    punchline and I think people are more likely to read it and get it, \r\nanyway,
    that's all my humble opinion, it's your thing good luck with it I hope it suceeds\r\n\r\n--N\r\n"

    comedy you need your straight man/funny man, clown/policeman combo. But enough
    personality in the type to draw interest, don't use times new roman for instance
    ;). If the type shouts 'I am zany', I think you lose the pleasure of being surprised

    first one better so well, I'm about to go and see 49-up so my final parting comments
    are: \r\n\r\n1. punctuation will work well in the heading, a comma a full-stop,
    it says read me, 'I'm a statement rather than a title' \r\n\r\n2. if you drop
    the leading or size of the order form it will give the heading more room to breathe,
    \r\n\r\n3. I would consider also droping the size of the heading font so that
    it plays on the left hand side without dominating all of the top\r\n\r\n4. Kerning
    could be tightened\r\n\r\n5. Nice Jensen\r\n\r\n6. Thanks for humouring me\r\n\r\n7.
