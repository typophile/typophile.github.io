  a Latin version too. Since I have both the languages in the same font together and
  I want the word spacing for Devanagari a little tighter than the Latin. How do I
  assign two separate word spacing in a single font?\r\n\r\nIs there a way to assign
  separate word spacings in FontLab?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch.\r\nSatya"

    U+0020 (and also as U+00A0 if you want the same glyph to serve as the no-break
    space) and another called something like /spave.dev/ and left unencoded. Then,
    in your Devanagari OpenType Layout you implement the Localised Forms 'locl' feature,
    and have a lookup that maps\r\n\r\nspace -> space.dev\r\n\r\nThe 'locl' layout
    feature is applied by Uniscribe and compatible layout engines prior to any other
    feature (but it also a good idea to order the lookups in your font so that 'locl'
    precedes others).\r\n\r\nNow, that's the approved method, but you will probably
    find that results vary because not all software will treat the wordspace character
    as part of the run of Devanagari text. But it should work in Windows Vista."

    of some sort. I mean, the instructions could have general use for any writing
    system, also non-complex, but for Devanagari, you'll need to end up using VOLT.
    At some point, FontLab Studio will support mark attachment but not yet. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Hello! Can I revive this thread for a moment?\r\n\r\nI've been trying this
    above-mentioned method in VOLT on Vista, and haven't been able to get it to work
    properly. I've created a <locl> feature with an alternate word space, and this
    does allow my text in Word, etc. to switch from the normal space to the alternate
    space, but not quite back again.\r\n\r\nWhen I just have Latin text, or Devanagari
    text, everything is fine. In the Latin text words are separated by the normal
    space, and in Devanagari text the words are separated by the alternate space.
    But when the two scripts mix, it isn't so happy.\r\n\r\nMy problem, as John and
    Sergey predict, appears when I have a text like \u0935\u0947 \u0935\u0930\u094D\u0937
    1962 \u0924\u0915. Specifically, my problem is the space around \"1962\"\u2026
    the space before the 1 is the alternate space, and the space after the 2 is a
    normal space. This is not how I'd like the line of text to render.\r\n\r\nIn Nepali
    text, for instance, it is less of an issue, as Nepali seems to use Latin figures
    and punctuation less often. But languages like Hindi, which may use it a lot,
    cause more difficulty. Although in my <locl> feature I also have alternate figures
    (one.deva, two.deva, etc.\u2026) and alternate punctuation (comma.deva, etc.),
    these do not switch the way the space does, even when I set the default language
    in Word to Hindi. I don't know why they won't switch.\r\n\r\nSo, if I use two
    space glyphs, everything is groovy. Until a \"Latin\" character pops up in the
    string of text. Afterwards, all \"Latin\" characters will be the default Latin
    characters\u2014including the word space\u2014until another Devanagari character
    comes up. Then the space glyph switches to its alternate again. I don't know why
    this happens, and I don't know why my other alternates don't switch either.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, I can get almost everything I put into VOLT to come out again properly!
    Except the below the base mark positioning. But that is another story ;-)"

    sounds like a layout engine issue, not a problem in your font.\r\n\r\n(hack alert!)
    You can try adding a contextual substitution to the font that replaces the default
    space by the Devanagari space, when the default space is preceded by a digit and
    followed by a Devanagari character. In pseudo-FDK notation,\r\n\r\n<code>sub [all
    digit glyphs] space' [all Devanagari glyphs] by space.dev;</code>"

  body: "I don't think that hack would work for Dan, Miguel. The issue here is probably
    that the layout engine is splitting the character string into separate glyph runs
    and associating word spaces with the preceding run. So in Dan's example the runs
    would look like this:\r\n\r\ndevanagari space | numerals space | devanagari\r\n\r\nBut
    what he needs to get his variant word spaces working correctly is either\r\n\r\ndevanagari
    space | numerals | space devanagari\r\n\r\nor a single run that merges numerals\r\n\r\ndevanagari
    space numerals space devanagari\r\n\r\n"

    I don't know how much substituting is supported in Word anyway.\r\n\r\nI think
    that you are right suggesting that this has to do with the layout engine and not
    the font, but I don't know enough to say for sure. John sums the issue up quite
    well."
