<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Kent, <br> <br>You have put it well. <br> <br>Do you mind if I insert (AND UNITIZING) and see if it meets with your approval. I am using uppercase to show it is not your words but mine. I am "not" rewriting your sentence, I am just asking if you agree with my insertion? <br> <br>..... <br> <br>"But Tschichold had to adapt to both constraints -- duplexing (AND UNITIZING) for Lino, unitizing for Mono. So he made the choice to make the two 'a's fit the 9 units (which yields a noticeably wide roman 'a') instead of cramping the italic in the 8-unit slot." <br> <br>........ <br> <br>Unless systems in Europe were not equal to America?

<div class=commentbody>Kent, nice experiment! <br> <br>> If Sabon had been designed solely for Monotype, the roman 'a' could have been put on 8 units <br> <br>My problem with that is I think the cramping of the 8-unit Italic "a" is so slight that making the Roman "a" so much better would have made more sense. <br> <br>> If Sabon had been designed solely for Monotype, the roman 'a' could have been put on 8 units, which would have given a more traditionally Garamondesque proportion; while the italic 'a' could have been placed on 9 units, so as not to be too narrow. <br> <br>Conversely, if Sabon had been designed solely for Linotype (with no Monotype issues), the two "a"s would have been duplexed, but to a more satisfying compromise width. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>BTW, I assume Sabon was optically graded. What size is that digital Sabon based on? I ask because the width decision on the "a" (9 versus 8) would have depended on the target point size. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>I am not so sure about that. First we must understand the meaning of this. <br> <br>Mike Parkers words. <br>..... <br>"The idea was to replace linotype operators with faster tape drives. In order to justify lines predictably, each character had to have a predictable width. Fairchild established a standard width for each character expressed in a single fixed set of eighteen units to the set width em to be used for all typefaces regardless of typeface design. The wider the column width, the larger the eighteen unit set width required." <br> <br>..... <br> <br>I read this to mean: Unlike Monotype where the units were based on the em of the type, The units in Linotype were simple a fixed formulae giving truth to predictability of column width regardless of type design. In otherwords the column width is more important than the type width. In any event, it appears to be quite cumbersome. And I predict your solution would not be quite that simple. <br> <br>Perhaps I am wrong! I don't think so. <br> <br>Gerald Giampa</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>Do you mind if I insert (AND UNITIZING) and see if it meets with your approval.</i> <br> <br>Gerald -- <br> <br>Actually, I do not agree, in this instance. I think you are misinterpreting Mike's reference to TTS. The development of TTS machines led to the introduction of unitizing systems within the Linotype line, but these units were not subsequently applied to all projects. TTS was used only (or at least predominantly) in the transmission and setting of newspaper copy. TTS units would only have been used on faces intended for newspaper composition. <br> <br>This is my understanding, but you might double-check with Mike. I don't have his new number since he moved. <br> <br>Now, news faces were the large bulk of Linotype's bread and butter in the late 1950s and 1960s, as newspaper comp was the last bastion of Lino's market. (Mike has said that Jackson Burke lamented that most of his tenure at the head of the MLCo. type department was spent forever revising faces for ever-narrowing newspaper columns.) <br> <br>But it was not the entirety of Lino's type output. Sabon would have been targeted toward the book composition market, and those houses would not have had TTS machines nor any need to conform to TTS standards. So I do not think it is reasonable to assume that Sabon needed to be designed to any unitized system on account of Linotype composition. <br> <br>Sabon would have been developed while Mike was at the helm of the American MLCo. type dept., I believe. The face was cut by Stempel (who were essentially German Linotype), but Mike might have some direct recollections. You could ask him. <br> <br>Hrant -- <br> <br>I do not know which size this digital Sabon (Adobe's BTW) would have been based upon. I would presume the 12 point, based on what I know of the general transition of designs from metal to photo to digital. But I can only assume. <br> <br>You may be right and the decision about which unit width to assign the 'a' to could have varied by size -- wider for the smaller sizes, narrower for display. On the other hand, I doubt that Tschichold would have made a different decision. Just a practical matter. Text would have been set primarily by machine comp; display would usually have been set by hand, I imagine. So all of the Lino and Mono sizes would probably all have the same wide 'a'. I suppose that the foundry display sizes could have been cut without these restrictions, but I don't know. I don't have information about what sizes were released in each medium. <br> <br>Clearly, you would have made a different decision under the same circumstances -- sacrificing the italic 'a'. Tschichold made the other decision. <br> <br>Obviously, Sabon was ripe for revision in digital without all the constraints, as aptly demonstrated by Jean-Fran</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know. But I don't think I'm understanding what you're trying to get at. <br> <br>Here's my point: If the design is based on an 18-unit system and the 'a' is allocated to 9 units, then even if there is slight adjustment overall, wider or narrower, for optical compensation at varying sizes, the 'a' will still be relatively wide. <br> <br>It's all relative. The 'a' will always appear relatively wide, compared to the general proportions of the design, if none of the letters are reassigned to different unit widths. <br> <br>This makes sense to me. Does it to you? Or are you driving at something different? <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent, I agree. <br>What I'm thinking though (and I'd have to carefully look at many glyphs in Sabon to be sure) is that the width discretization going on simply affected the "a" the most (or at least a lot more than average), and that we can't judge the "a" adequately without knowing the target point size. Kind of hard to explain - or maybe I'm imagining it. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the reason you gave (the combination of style duplexing and "width snapping") makes total sense. <br> <br>This all started when I said Monotype has at least that limitation which foundry (and digital) don't - something that's pretty obvious to anybody not religious about Monotype- and the blame for the width of the Sabon "a" can be attributed to that limitation, at least partially. When it comes to the Monotype "width snapping" limitation, Sabon is not a special case qualitatively, just quantitatively: the "a" would still have been too wide (just less), or maybe too narrow, even if JT didn't have to factor in the Linotype's limitation (duplexing) as well. <br> <br>My other line of thought was just an attempt at analyzing JT's design decisions. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald -- <br> <br>A picture may be worth several words. Here's what a Linotype matrix looks like, for those who've never seen one. Sorry the photo isn't better. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14919.jpg alt="Linotype Matrix"> <br> <br>This is a 14-point 'w' matrix (I don't recall which face), roman duplexed with italic. This matrix is shown in its operating position -- i.e., "upside down". If you turned it over, you'd notice that the letters are actually right-reading, and the roman would be on the bottom and the italic on the top. Obviously, each letter must have the same set width. <br> <br>Generally speaking, a roman letter would be duplexed with the corresponding letter in either italic or bold. (This was not the case, however, with small caps, which duplexed with other sorts. There was a standard scheme of what went with what, but I don't have a map handy.) <br> <br>I hope this helps folks trying to make sense of this thread. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Interesting. <br>I think the Lino boys applied their optical scaling expertise to the drawings. Would JT have allowed that? What about the small Monotype sizes? I have (actually <i>will</i> have, in January) access to a good size range of metal Sabon, but I don't know if it's Stempel or Monotype.

Thank you. <br> <br>I agree that the unit system had limitations, but it was an engineering puzzle, not a method of soliciting customer complaint. It was a challenge as you say, but for the most part, the engineers did a very fine job. <br> <br>Monotype houses were noted for typographical expertise or they would have purchased a lessor system. More skill was required in running Monotype Systems than Linotypes. Monotypes were the system of choice for both trade typographers and book houses. Not so often, run of the mill print shops or newspapers. There were many exceptions. <br> <br>Lanston used typographers and fine book printers as, "Beta Testers". Bruce Rogers was amongst them. I can assure you, non were shy with comment, each trying to out do one another as a method of showing off their typographical finikitiness. (Is that a word?) And they didn't give a tinkers dam about punchcutters problems, or unit rows, they just wanted the typeface to pass their highest standards. <br> <br>That was the primary goal of Lanston's punchcutting department. To satisfy production oriented owners and cranky artistic and very opinionated personalities. They did so, for the most part, very well. <br> <br>With "multiple typesetting system planning" the Sabon "roman and italic a' is not illustrative of English Monotypes finest capabilities, probably the same is true for Linotype. <br> <br>Criticism should be kept in perspective. This face is an exception, not a rule. This experiment in joint development was doomed to have "some fall out". <br> <br>Characters of the alphabet in the Monotype System, were not out of necessity, "too wide" or "too narrow" or as some would suggest, never quite right. In most cases adjustments were made and the type designer would never see the difference. Either did the fussy customers after their complaints had vanished. I know the problem with the Sabon roman and italic "a" could have been minimized to the point this discussion would never take place. This is a grossly exaggerated example. <br> <br>However the Linotype duplex problem is an efficiency that is bound to cause problems. <br> <br>But the secret to making Sabon "roman a" and the italic "b" appear correct in the Linotype version may lie in </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>Actually it is a simple mistake. It reads "Seven unit sizes". But it is based on 14 units. You can have 18 monotype units and have only 1 or 2 unit sizes, such as the 3 unit type for train schedules we custom cut for American Eastern Railways. Actually digitized the face in 1989, imagine! <br> <br>....... <br>Rodolfo Capeto words, <br> <br>"The first was designed for use on Linotype and Monotype systems. The second version of Sabon was designed for Stempel handsetting". In any case the drawings reproduced in the Penrose Annual article (that you may have in your hands now) are of the "Stempel" variety (long extenders, narrow 'a'). Interestingly, they also conform to the Monotype 18-unit width grid." <br>........ <br> <br>This gives strength to my understanding of this particular cutting. Without more "surprise knowledge" of Stempel systems I would not think using Monotype's 18 unit grid would have been standard practice. <br> <br>Measures of "harmonious typesetting standardization" appear to be the very underpinning of intention for the "Sabon Project". It would seem to me, all parties were attempting to co-ordinate usage of Sabon to service some special objective. <br> <br>Few examples are so clearly illustrate the old adage, "the exception proves the rule". <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>More interesting is the comparison with Linotype, with their TTS. </i> <br> <br>Just to clarify, TTS did not belong to Linotype. As I understand it, the TeleTypesetting System was an independent technology for transmitting wire stories to newspapers. Those publishers who subscribed to the service would receive stories via wire, which came out as punched tape. These tapes were then fed into the composing machine and produced typeset stories for the newspaper to publish. The device that interpreted the punched tape would be fitted to any of the various composing systems. Linotype was only one (arguably the most common). <br> <br>The point of the unitized standard for typefaces used with the TTS was that the stories would always run to the exact same characters per line and, consequently, an exact column length regardless of the layout of the paper -- specifically, regardless of the column width of the newspaper's grid. <br> <br>Thus, a wire service could wait until the last possible hour to file a late-breaking story by indicating in advance that they would have the story run to X column inches and the papers could then continue to lay out their editions by holding open X inches of space for that story. This kind of just-in-time publishing depended upon reliable, consistent character counts, and column lengths. <br> <br>It had nothing to do with justification <i>per se.</i> <br> <br>The Linotype machine required no unit-system in order to achieve effortless justification. It employed a mechanical system that I think was ingenious, but I don't think I can describe it fully here. Basically, it employed wedge-shaped spacebands that adapted automatically to fill out the line. <br> <br>-- Kent. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>But maybe some smart investigation (like seeing what fonts were used in those pages) could narrow it down a lot.</i> <br> <br>Well, obviously, the fonts used were self-spacing types. ;-) <br> <br>Here's some research along different lines: <br> <br>Linn Boyd Benton took out his patent for a system of self-spacing type in 1883. The United States Type-Founders' Association defined the American point system of type sizes in 1886. Notice that this article still cross-references the old, named body sizes. <br> <br>Updike (Vol. I pg. 34) mentions that "In 1894 a western firm introduced this system of self-spacing types, every type in their entire output being placed on a body the width of which was equal to an even division of the standard 'pica em.'" This term 'pica em' was apparently soon replaced by the term 'point-set'. Note that your article still refers to divisions of the Pica em. <br> <br>Given this, I am going to assert that this article dates from between 1886 and around 1896, somewhere thereabouts. <br> <br>The first typeface issued by (American) Lanston Monotype was in 1896 and it was for the Model C keyboard, which I believe was the arrangement that introduced the 18-unit system. I do not know if this configuration was utilized prior to that. <br> <br>Hrant, is this article specifically identified by Lawson & Bidwell as an ATF piece? Updike does not name the "western firm" he refers to. I would have thought that if it was ATF, he would have simply said so. ATF was formed in 1892 and Benton, Waldo & Co. was one of the original founders that merged into it. I can't imagine there was any other sizable foundry left after that to introduce such a system, especially given Benton's patent on the scheme. Yet, Updike says that every type was adapted to this system, which certainly does not describe ATF. <br> <br>-- Kent. <br> <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Regarding unit systems: there seems to be some doubt in this forum as to its value. I do not suggest that posters are detractors, but there seems to be a bit of conjecture about its flexibility. Many are aware that when FW Goudy was presented with the task of designing his Goudy Gimbel (38E) for the Monotype system, he found it a long and difficult task, having never before been restricted to the width of his letters. You have to remember that Linotype and Montype were all there was for machine setting in those days. Neither were considered crude or archaic, rather they were thought of as amazing marvels of ultimate "hi-tek" engineering. They now seem to funny to most, but they were the result of a logical evolution from hand-setting to machine setting from recirculated cold types (the Page machine) to the very first Lino and Mono machines, which were even at that vastly different from the first successful operating versions of both. <br> <br>It is understandable that FWG would find this restricting. He did, however deal with it, and the type was a great commercial success, as is evidenced by the fact that many matrix cases of it still survive. I don't find 38E to be the prettiest type ever done, but I don't see anything wrong with its set values or fit. I maintain that it is not terribly restrictive to work within assigned unit widths for a letter. The standard C, C1 and C2 arrangements accommodate a grteat many of Monotype's faces. This is due to none of them requiring unusually wide or narrow boundaries for an a or an e etc. What I am saying is that if a face is based on a kind of "ideal" set of proportions everything works out in the end. <br> <br>In the case of certain new releases it was not uncommon to allow the type designer to create an new set of unit row arrangement for the die case and it attendant keyboard stopbars and caster wedge. This is evidenced in Goudy's Kennerley Oldstyle, whcih uses not only its own keybar arrangement, but is also the first Monotype face to have an expanded system of 20 units. If you look through any jumbo Monotype speciman books you will come to an antire two page spread of noted Special Arrangements that expand on the standard 18 unit C arrangement. <br> <br>In setting Monotype the keyboard is constantly aware of units and the calculating of them. This is an absolute requirement in the setting of tabular work. In text work one is also constantly aware of unit counting in a much simpler way. <br> <br>I was not really aware that Liontype even worked on a unitizes system. What made this a revelation to me is that on the Linotype, the channels (72 or 90 channels) carrying the mats have a goodly space each side of the channels of mats, and I assumed that there was lots of latitude to widen or skinny up a character to some degree. This makes no reference to the problems of an italic and roman being on the same matrrix. So I learned something. <br> <br>In setting straight matter on the Linotype, a person is not required to count units, merely to keep an eye on the assembler so that when the measure is nearly filled he or she can decide how to fill out the line. As Kent Lew has noted the expanding spacebads do most of the work just like your computer does in setting justified). In some cases, thinspaces are dropped into the line of assemble mats by handl, for situations like small caps. For a few years I was a Linotype operator on dialies and weeklies and did a lot of typesetting. On the Linotype, tabular work was terribly difficult, if the shop did not carry the proper sets of tabular values fixed spaces. If this setting was an a narrow measure, there was little room for more than one spaceband, and it was tough going. The most awkward thing I ever had to set was track results for sulky racing. This had to fit in an 11 pica column, in a special very condensed 7 point condensed gothic whose name I cannot recall. This was so unusual that the racetrack promoter carried his own set of special Linotype mats that he presented to the weekly paper in each town that he travelled to for the season's racing, since he made his money on selling the race tout sheets. Sorry for the walk down Memory Lane. Old guys do that. <br> <br>What I suggest is that with Linotype and Monotype the unit system did not cause any typeface to be a failure because of the restrictions of width. I can't think of a face where an s or an a is pronouncedy too wide or too narrow, and I don't think it is because I am easly pleased. <br>I am ignorant of the Sabon a too-wide problem, but my guess is that perhaps it was a conscious and decision by it designer. I don't think that is impossible, since humans do make some odd choices. <br> <br>It's Saturday morning and I have just spent the last five days cutting and recutting an 18 point letter f punch. The matrix is punched and rought trimmed, so this morning I get to cast it an line and fit it . . . so here goes nothing . . . <br> <br>JIm Rimmer</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant -- <br> <br>The 1923 specimen refers to the Specimen of 1895. So that must be what you have a facsimile of. There you go then. <br> <br>Re: Updike. The problem I have with understanding Updike to be referring to Benton's foundry is that his date of 1894 would have been two years *after* Benton merged his foundry into the formation of ATF. Now, I think I may have heard that some members of ATF continued to operate semi-independently, so I suppose this could reconcile the matter. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer: <br><i>>I was not really aware that Liontype even worked on a unitizes system.</i> <br> <br>I feel I must reiterate (because perhaps some of Gerald's intervening posts may have muddied things) -- the Linotype system (metal) <b>did not</b> require the type designer to work within fixed unit-widths. There were a few particular situations where a typeface would be unitized -- for reasons having nothing to do with the Linotype system <i>per se.</i> The foremost examples were TTS typefaces, for specialized newspaper setting, and special faces for setting tabular matter (which, as Jim pointed out, was a real pain on the Linotype). <br> <br>Let me be clear, I do not think that Linotype was superior to Monotype because of the lack of a unitizing constraint. Nor do I think that Monotype was superior to Linotype because it lacked duplexing constaints. I think both were marvelous inventions and amazing examples of mechanical ingenuity. I think the type designers and letter draftsmen (and women) did a remarkable job in both systems. Each had its strengths and its weaknesses. Both brought us, happily, to where we are now. <br> <br><i>>It's Saturday morning and I have just spent the last five days cutting [...]</i> <br> <br>Jim, best of luck fitting that 'f'. <br> <br>-- Kent. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> Goudy ... found it a long and difficult task <br> <br>And isn't it true that Goudy wasn't... uh... the sharpest tool in the shed when it came to technical stuff? <br> <br>> jumbo Monotype speciman books <br> <br>BTW, I've seen the landmark specimen books for ATF and Linotype, but -besides the "Tally of Types" thing- nothing for Monotype. What are some dates for those, and which is the "best" one? For one thing, I'd like to see how [well] they did their optical scaling. <br> <br>> .... the racetrack promoter .... <br> <br>Great memories! <br> <br>> What I suggest is that with Linotype and <br>> Monotype the unit system did not cause <br>> any typeface to be a failure because <br>> of the restrictions of width. <br> <br>What constitutes a "failed typeface"? <br> <br>> I am ignorant of the Sabon a too-wide problem <br> <br>It's interesting how some people (like me) would consider knowing about the "textbook" Sabon case central to good type appreciation, while others may not. Obviously, you're living proof that you don't have to know about Sabon (or that "class" of insight in general) to do great work. But still. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>> I think I may have heard that some members <br>> of ATF continued to operate semi-independently <br> <br>Some tibdits from the 1981 book: <br>- The American Point System was adopted in 1886. <br>- ATF was formed in 1892. <br>- First collective specimen book (with no mention of ATF) was in 1893. <br>- First formal ATF specimen book: 1895. <br>- ATF consolidates its manufacturing facilities in 1903. <br> <br>So Updike's "1894" is about a year before ATF used its own name in any specimen, and about 9 years before ATF made all its fonts in one place. <br> <br>> I do not think that .... <br> <br>But you do think that foundry was superior to both? <br>I mean in terms of type design integrity. <br> <br>What did JvK think? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Good morning from Finland, <br> <br>Kent, <br> <br>I thought my special efforts to have Mike Parker speak of the matter was appropriate, and as such did not muddy waters. Perhaps Jim Rimmer just missed the posting. I have included extra text of Parker's words which I feel may give "weight". Therefore more memorable. <br> <br>E-mail excerpt sent to Gerald Giampa about Linotype units by Mike Parker, these are his words. <br> <br>..... <br>The typefaces redrawn for teletypesetter use were a TINY group of popular newstext and classified designs, and NOTHING ELSE. <br> <br>However, since Fairchild monkeyed with the standard ratio of set size to column width every few years, this small group of typefaces had to be redrawn over and over again just to maintain simple legibility on the current standard. <br> <br>TTS was a black curse to all designers of linecaster newstext and classified typefaces from 1940s to 1980s. <br> <br>While this group of types made up a tiny section of the library of fonts, it made up a majority of matrices sold to constantly feed batteries of roaring teletypesetter high speed text machines smashing matrices together at speeds undreamt of by Ottmar Mergenthaler. They ate matrices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, with snacks in between. <br> <br>This dreadful exercise provided Mergenthaler with a large slice of annual profit, hence its importance to the company. <br> <br>Mike Parker <br>.......... <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Probably you are not asking me. Also I can not speak for another company. However this face was jointly developed. My instincts are that if there is a failure it would be because too many cooks could spoil the broth. The face was jointly developed by Monotype and Lanston. <br> <br>But my suspicions are they did a "good" job. I suspect it will be very hard to find a sample of Lanston's Metropolitan because it was a private cutting for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. <br> <br>You would have to look for theirs. I think the real question is, how is the optical scaling in Metropolitan and Centaur in the digital version? Not very good in either case, as there isn't any.

<div class=commentbody>{It's really frustrating being prevented from posting to the correct thread...} <br> <br>So I did some preliminary analysis of Monotype Centaur, by eyeballing the vertical proportions of enlargements of all the sizes, and it seems that there were different masters for the following size ranges: <br> <br>6 <br>8, 9 <br>10-12 <br>14, 16 <br>18-72 <br> <br>Five masters seems like a good amount (I've heard it was usually three), so they did take optical scaling pretty seriously, at least in the case of Centaur. <br> <br>On the other hand, I don't know yet if the compensation is linear or better. If it's linear, it would put Monotype slightly below Linotype in terms of optical compensation (since it seems the latter used progressive scaling for each size, but linear math - Kent might correct me). If it's better than linear, it would put Monotype at least as good as Linotype, and probably better depending on how you look at it and/or what actual point size you're looking at. But neither would be as good as ATF, where they used progressive parabolic-looking compensation. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>If Centaur did not have 11 pt patterns, I am surprised. Anything is possible but without question a goodly collection of patterns were made for Centaur/Metropolitan/Arrighi. <br> <br>Right hand column: <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/Burgess5.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/Burgess5.html</a> <br> <br>Cutting cards are in existence, it is a matter of access. They would complete the story. <br> <br>If Bruce Rogers and Frederick Warde were happy, I would be happy. I have never heard they were not. <br> <br>I am not convinced that merely using every trick in the book makes for a good type face. A body of evidence supports the contrary. Some might say that is a matter of taste. I say, yes it is. <br> <br>Legibility and readability were not the predominant determining factors in this cutting. Bruce Rogers did not subscribe, either do I, to all of Stanley Morison's dictums of readability. Looking at Morison's own work, either did he. The point is, the adjustments were not made so that it could be read when "overinked", or readable for the "nearly blind". This cutting was designed for "Book Arts" production. <br> <br>The intent was to make this type face "look right" in different point sizes. I know it will seem crass to some of you readers, but I must dare use the word "art". <br> <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/Metropolitan.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/Metropolitan.html</a> <br> <br>This cutting stands as exemplary type craftsmanship. Patterns for optical adjustments were made for many different point sizes. Cutting cards would certainly complete the story of this fine production. <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, I did some more calculations of Monotype Centaur. I measured the width of the word "the" (from leftmost black to rightmost black) in each size, normalized the measures by size, and then normalized to the 14 point (since that was the single original foundry size). Here are the [rounded] precentages: <br> <br> 6: 121% <br> 8: 114% <br> 9: 107% <br>10: 100% <br>11: 100% <br>12: 103% <br>14: 100% <br>16: 106% <br>18: 84% <br>22: 90% <br>24: 95% <br>30: 95% <br>36: 94% <br>42: 96% <br>48: 96% <br>60: 97% <br>72: 97% <br> <br>What I can tentatively conclude is that: <br>1) The groups are: 6; 8; 9-16; 18-72 <br>2) The spacing was done [totally] by eye (hence the sloppy fluctuations). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>But neither would be as good as ATF, where they used progressive parabolic-looking compensation.</i> <br> <br>Hrant, I need to back up a minute and re-examine this with you. <br> <br>You have said that Linotype's optical grading was linear. I presume you are saying this based on a sample graph that I posted to some other thread a while back, in which a few parameters appeared to be essentially linear. Correct me if I'm mistaken. <br> <br>What parameters are you examining in ATF faces that lead you to the "parabolic" comment? <br> <br>The Linotype parameters that I presented were the few that I had data for immediately at hand (from the Advance Proofs for Dwiggins's Falcon) -- size of face (i.e., measurement from top of ascender to bottom of descender), height of the capital H, and length of lowercase alphabet. <br> <br>I am looking at the waterfall of ATF Garamond that you sent me. We can, of course, discount the first parameter, since the face on the body in any given design is practically guaranteed to be linear by point size. Since this sample you sent shows only lowercase, I cannot measure the cap H height. But I can -- and did -- measure the lowercase alphabet length. Here is my graph. (Apologies for the large image.) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/15270.gif alt="ATF Garamond alphabet graph"> <br> <br>My data -- <br>Point size (l.c. alphabet length in points): <br>6 pt (86.5) <br>7 pt (94.25) <br>8 pt (103) <br>10 pt (117.25) <br>12 pt (133) <br>14 pt (148) <br>18 pt (192) <br>24 pt (250.5) <br>30 pt (305.5) <br>36 pt (362) <br>48 pt (476) <br> <br>The y-axis is 1:1, but the x-axis is in a ratio of 10 points for every 1 point size increase; I did this so that it would be readable. Thus you can't infer anything necessarily from the angle of the line, but this doesn't affect its essential linearity. There does seem to be a shift in slope at the 14-point mark. We've noted that there is a shift in the underlying master design at this point, so I'm not surprised. <br> <br>Aside from that, however, this data is essentially <b>linear</b>. Certainly no less so than the Falcon data (which only ranged from 6 to 12 point, BTW). I do not see any parabolic compensation. At least not in set-width: character widths combined with fitting. In this respect, in these cases, ATF and Linotype do not seem very different. <br> <br>For comparison: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/15271.gif alt="Falcon Alphabet Graph"> <br> <br>6 pt (90) <br>7 pt (98) <br>8 pt (107) <br>9 pt (115) <br>10 pt (124) <br>11 pt (132) <br>12 pt (141) <br> <br>I am open to the possibility that other parameters -- stem weight, cap-height, x-height, extender proportions -- may not be linear. I will be interested to see data on these. <br> <br>But I will ask you to extend the same openness to considerations of Linotype (or even Monotype) until we have data to examine. I have no personal stake in defending the Linotype drawing office. Linotype just happens to be an object of my study. I remain open to whatever results might turn up. <br> <br>But let's gather more evidence before drawing conclusions. <br> <br>-- Kent. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm... <br>I'm not sure exactly what's going on. Let me show you what I have, and maybe we can figure things out. <br> <br>First of all, though: You're right, some of what I said is pretty tentative - I'm sorry if I jumped the gun. And some of my [provisional] conclusions are guided by what may be called "quasi-scientific hunches". I'll try to explain that bit as I go along. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>My intentions in this process are to arrive at guidelines for digital type designers wishing to make different cuts of a given design optimized for different sizes. So what I'm looking for is the set of deviations from some "deliberative ideal" that needs to be applied to a given size. The deviations are in width, color, letterspacing, vertical proportions and a bunch of other things. In my (still-ongoing) ATF Garamond analysis I'm measuring 10 parameters, but all in relation to the largest size I have at hand, the 48. This means that my values are scalar. Below is some of the data, for lc alphabet width: <br> <br> 6: 241 <br> 7: 225 <br> 8: 215 <br>10: 196 <br>12: 185 <br>14: 177 <br>18: 179 <br>24: 173 <br>30: 170 <br>36: 168 <br>48: 166 <br> <br>And here's what it looks like: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/15332.gif alt=ATF-G_length.gif> <br> <br>Some observations: <br>- There are two parts: 6-14, and 18-48. <br>- However, the 14 is suspicious (see below), so the cutoff might in fact be between 12/14 instead. <br>- The smaller-size section is not linear, it's curved. I'm not sure it's <i>quadratic</i>* as opposed to cubic or something else (and the data is probably too sparse and jumpy to ever know), but I gravitate to that because of three things: the next heuristically logical step after linear is quadratic; type is two-dimensional; and Luc[as] de Groot has found that weight gradation proceeds quadratically with respect to the horizontal scale. <br>- The larger-size section looks mostly linear. <br> <br>* I'm now using this instead of "parabolic". <br> <br>One big caveat: unlike the Centaur and Falcon specimens, my ATF Garamond stuff is "unofficial": Mr Benton wasn't there to assure me that each size of what I used is the real stuff. Of the 11 sizes I used, two of them look suspicious: the 14, which is somewhat too narrow; and the 7, which is obviously too light. I'm tempted to pull those out of my study, but there are some good reasons not to, and instead just give this caveat as needed. <br> <br>The other nine parameters I've studied even less, but the ones dealing with width seem to behave in exactly the same way as above, while: <br>- Vertical proportions also largely seem to follow the quadratic+linear combination. <br>- Weight seems to be one single quadratic curve. <br>- Stroke contrast looks... hard to describe right now. <br> <br>To be fair, I guess if you applied this technique to Falcon you'd get the same non-linear behavior! And as you say, your Falcon data (which was indeed my source) only spans the text sizes. <br> <br>So yes, it's too early to say with all confidence that ATF was better than Linotype at optical scaling. <i>On the other hand</i>, I've seen a body of anecdotal evidence (as well as just plain tangential observations) that seem to indicate that the Bentons were in fact on another level. I've revealed these to you in private recently, but if people here are interested I'll try to collect my thoughts enough for public delivery. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>BTW: <br>> the face on the body in any given design is practically guaranteed to be linear by point size. <br> <br>I've found that this is not always the case. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm. I'd like to be able to follow you here, but you lost me with your data. Can you describe how you arrived at those numbers -- give them units or relate them to something known or measureable? I can't figure what those numbers represent, so I can't assess the curve. <br> <br>I think the Bentons were possibly on another level with regard to optical compensation. But it's hard to separate that aspect from the other aspects that differentiate foundry from linecasting. <br> <br><i>>> the face on the body in any given design is practically guaranteed to be linear by point size. <br> <br>>I've found that this is not always the case. </i> <br> <br>Well, then we can measure this parameter too, if you think it's important. <br> <br>I derived some formulae from my graphs. The interesting thing is that the ATF Garamond is pretty linear from 6 to 14, but from 14 to 48 is not -- *unless* you take out the 14. From 18 to 48 is strictly linear. <br> <br>In the following, y is lowercase alphabet length in points, x is nominal point size. <br> <br>ATF Garamond, text sizes [6-14]: y = 7.6875 (x + 5.252) <br>ATF Garamond, display sizes [18-48]: y = 9.5 (x + 2.2105) <br>Falcon, text sizes: y = 8.5 (x + 4.588) <br> <br>These are descriptive rather than prescriptive, so I'm sure they won't help you. But they do describe linear relationships. It is interesting to see just how accurately the results for y conform to the data measured. ATF Garamond 8 point is the only real outlier. <br> <br>When I have a better idea what you're doing, I'll have a better idea how what I'm doing compares. <br> <br>-- Kent. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The way I got those numbers (which have no value on their own, just in relation to one-another) is that I measured in pixels from the 600 dpi scan, and then divided by point size. So what you get is a non-dimensional view, like in digital type design. <br> <br>> differentiate foundry from linecasting <br> <br>Are you saying that the Linotype had optical scaling limitations?

<div class=commentbody>Okay, I think I get it now. I was able to replicate your curve by scaling the l.c. alphabet measurements by the ratio of the type size to your base 48 point. That is, I took the 6-point alphabet and multiplied by 8, so that if the 6-point design was 48 points then the equivalent alphabet length would be 692 points, etc. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/15339.gif alt="ATF Garamond Alphabet Scaled"> <br> <br>I won't bother listing the values, since they can easily be derived from my previous data.

<div class=commentbody>That's a nice-looking graph. What SW do you use for that, anyway? <br> <br>I think one can conclude that: <br>1) There are indeed two segments. <br>2) The data points are "well-behaved" (unlike the Monotype Centaur numbers for example). This means the ATF boys were using math, not eyeballing. However, this doesn't preclude the possibility (I'd even say probability) that the boundaries of the equations were determined by eye. I feel that's how a good "engineer" (like Benton) would have done it in fact. <br> <br>And when you couple these two observations, even the 14 point might fit it. BTW, I wonder where <i>your</i> 14 point (the one you told me looks more like a display cut) falls on the graph. <br> <br>BTW, what do you get when you apply my "point size normalization" to the Falcon numbers? <br> <br>> I'm not sure what to make of this curve. <br> <br>If I were a betting man, I'd put the highest odds on a quadratic shape. <br> <br>> Standard Alignments ... may or may not skew your study. <br> <br>That's a very good point - one that I hadn't considered. <br>There is in fact such a chart in one of the ATF specimen books - I'll scan it up for you guys. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I am aware you are trying to reverse engineer ATF Garamond. If instead, or later are dissecting Monotype there were often two versions of 14, 18, and other sizes normally thought of as display. Often two cuttings. One for display, the other for large composition. Alignment was also an issue in both. <br> <br>Even Hadriano was cut for 24 pt large comp. <br> <br>I think I still have in Vancouver a optical devise that measures types in one tenth of one ten thousands of an inch. This devise would prove most useful for these purposes. <br> <br>The optical devise needs to be kept out of the sun, at least when measuring, and the material must be kept in the same room for a period of time to become adjusted to the same room temperature. There are few devises as accurate as this, and almost none, if any devises like it, specifically made for measuring type. Do you think I should see if it is there? <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant -- <br> <br>A couple of things. Tracy shows a diagram of Standard Line alignment (also called Point Line) on page 49 of <i>Letters of Credit.</i> ATF Garamond was cast on Art Line, though, which allows for longer descenders; but I believe the same principle is in play. <br> <br>If you still have your hands on that 1923 ATF book, I discovered that a chart of alphabet lengths is given on pp. 584-585. Wish I'd seen this before manually measuring your sample. Turns out my measurements were only off by a point here or there. The 14 point, BTW, is listed as 149, versus my measurement of yours at 148. <br> <br>Software? Are you kidding? You'll laugh: I make up these graphs in Quark.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant <br> <br>ATF's reference to their "art line" referred to the proportions (parameters) of the letter, according to them. One such example is their Cloister Oldstyle and Cloister Light families, which are drawn to have a smallish x-height, with more dimension left to the ascenders and descenders, with the largest share of the space dedicated to the ascenders. <br> <br>If you can get your hands on a 1912 or a 1923 big book, you can scout out what other faces are drawn to their "art line". <br> <br>As you will see if you can read that part in their big books, it doesn't refer to the actual mechanics of alignment specifically, but rather to the faces' artistic consideration of height dimensions. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, Art Line refers to an alternative proportion of vertical space. It is used for designs that ATF wanted to allot more descender space for -- usually, of course, this is at the expense of some x-height, and thus the results look more bookish and "elegant", like Garamond, Bodoni, Cloister. <br> <br>I presume that the point of declaring in the catalog that a face was cast on Art Line was to indicate to the customer that these fonts would not align (baseline) with their other fonts cast on standard Point Line. <br> <br>Nevertheless, I would guess that there was a standard established for each size of Art Line that determined the placement of the baseline on the body. That is, I would expect all fonts of the same size, cast on Art Line, to align with each other. Is this not so, Jim? <br> <br>It is this standard aspect of the alignment that I believe Hrant is interested in. <br> <br>I presume, Hrant, that it could be derived from samples. I would guess that it follows similar principles to Point Line, but with different figures. As you will see if you examine the Point Line arrangement carefully, the purpose of the standard was to make it possible to place different sizes on the same line and align them by cutting appropriate point-size leads to make up the vertical differences. That's why the division of ascent/descent was established in whole points (thus "Point" Line). <br> <br>But perhaps I am wrong, and Art Line did not accommodate mixed sizes on a line easily, in which case it may not be so simple to derive from examples. <br> <br>-- Kent.</div>

Line up standards were a primary foundry issue. Line up for Caslon had to change for the point and pica system. Its position had to be "first found", then imposed. ATF inherited Caslon matrices with yet a different body system than the original Caslon foundry. I can not remember whether the Caslon Foundry based their transfer point and pica standard to mimic American Type Founders. I believe that is the case. I wish I had the source here or I would check. What I do know is that Lanston had their cutting in 1915 which predates the Caslon Foundry refitting released in their 1924 Catalogue. Theirs, ATF and ours seemed to line up pretty dam good. Made me wonder. <br> <br>Unfortunately I am rusty on all this now. <br> <br>In any event it would be impossible to preserve the original line up standard from Caslon's original matrices.

<div class=commentbody>Kent, Hrant <br> <br>I think I understand that the question is as much about standard alignment of Art Line types as it is their anatomy, and it sort of makes sense that if two faces are both drawn to those paramters, they would match in base-alignment. However, I don't have castings of any two such types that I could proof together or put on an alignment gauge to test. So I wouldn't want to assume that they would mechanically align on the base. <br> <br>If I were going to pursue this line of research, I would first try to get actual cast letters of two differing faces done on the Art line. For my purposes of checking metal type alignment, I select a letter with the most emphatic baseline. Something flat like the cap or lowercase z works well. If the termination on the baseline of the z descends a little, I pay attention to the horizontal stroke which gives a good indication of the baseline. <br> <br>There is a man in Baltimore who own a metal type treasure-house called the House of Type. He is not listed in any phone book under that name. His name is Guy Botterill. A most UNUSUAL man, with one of the world's largest collections. I can't say that he will give you a specimen letter, but you could ask. <br> <br>If you can't find him, let me know, and I will dig through my haystack of papers and see if i can find him. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>In any event it would be impossible to preserve the original line up standard from Caslon's original matrices.</i> <br> <br>Gerald, this makes sense and I suppose you're right. I was trying to interpret two things: the ATF claim that Caslon Oldstyle was cast from original matrices (a little bit dubious) and the indication in the 1923 catalog that it was cast on "Original Line" (whatever that means). But you're right, of course, the original Caslon types would not have been cast on point/pica bodies. <br> <br><i>>I'm not sure this is a correct view. I do think that designs with long descenders tend to have smaller x-heights, but that's irrespective of the ATF alignments.</i> <br> <br>Well, Hrant, the addition descender length has to come from somewhere.

I don't think you can do that definitively from a scan. <br> <br>My main point in bringing up this alignment stuff in the first place, however, is just to point out that the proportion of the ascent/descent in different sizes of ATF fonts may have as much to do with the established alignment standards as it does with any notions (Benton's or otherewise) of proper optical compensations. So take any curves with a grain of salt. <br> <br>-- Kent. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kent, <br> <br>Actually, I am not sure what the ATF advertising literatures said but their matrices were made from "strikes" off the "original punches". The original matrices were still at the Caslon Foundry. If not they would have to ship them back and forth as the orders came in. (I hate that, I sound like Nicolas Barker?) Right hand column. <br> <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/Burgess5.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/Burgess5.html</a> <br> <br>I can't imagine why they would have attempted to match existing line. Each body would have had significant differences. They would not be attempting to replenish existing stocks for early customers of the original Caslon. God forbid! <br> <br>But Kent, I have learned one thing in the foundry business. Never presume anything. Never think for some other company. They will do the most peculiar things. <br> <br>So I reserve the right to be wrong. <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>justifying my view that what we're seeing is probably quadratic.</i> <br> <br>You've said that, but now I've been looking at this again and I don't see that it is. <br> <br>I think I've shown convincingly that the alphabet length is essentially linear. Scaling the data to equivalencies to some master size doesn't really change the essential relationships of the lengths. There should be a set relationship between the linear graph and the scaled curve, and I don't think that relationship is a quadratic one. <br> <br>I went back to the alphabet lengths given by the ATF book and revised my formula. The text portion of the scale (6, 8, 10, 12, and even 14) can be expressed by y=7.83333x + 40, where x is the point size and y is the alphabet length. (The accuracy of this is within 0.33333 pts of the stated length for 8 and 10, and 0.66667 pts for 14.) <br> <br>If you assume a 12-point master drawing and scale everything to that, then the new curve (which is shown in one of my graphs above) can simply be expressed as y = 480/x + 94, where x again equals the point size and y equals the alphabet length, scaled to 12-point equivalency. Again, the accuracy is within about a half a point. <br> <br>It's not quadratic at all. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the alphabet length is essentially linear. <br> <br>I guess it depends how you look at it. <br>From the perspective of digital type design, the necessary thing is to know/decide what kind of modifications need to be done to a "deliberative ideal".

The line that was first graphed is expressed as some factor *times* the point size plus a constant; the curve produced by scaling the data is expressed as some factor *divided* by the point size plus a constant.

<div class=commentbody>Kent, let me try to explain this - as much to myself as to you! <br> <br>You're physically designing a digital font, and you have the "optimal" design let's say for the 12 point cut. Now you want to alter it to work better for smaller sizes. Assuming you're going to use numbers to do so (or at least get the first iteration), then the relationship of the numbers is not linear. Here's why: <br> <br>Let's say you're working on the width increase. If you follow the ATF Garamond, the ratio you'd adjust for the 8 point is ~115.3%, and for the 6 it's ~129.9%. The percentages 100, 115.3 and 129.9 do not sit on a line when graphed against point size. The point is for example that you can't interpolate (linearly) the 8 point number from the 12 and the 6. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Okay, yeah, I got that. They don't sit on a line. I can see that. <br> <br>But are you seeing my point? It's the "higher order" and "quadratic" that I'm having trouble with. When you say "higher order" I imagine that there will be a variable squared or something like deGroot's formula. <br> <br>What I've been attempting to show is that the formula for these curves is actually very simply derived from the linear equation. <br> <br>Let me review. The general expression for a linear equation is y = sx + c, where s is the slope and c is a constant, right? The equation for your "scaled" curve is simply y = mc/x + ms, where s and c are still the slope and constant from your linear equation, and m is the point size of your master design. It's an inverse relationship -- not what I would call a higher order. <br> <br>The curve for your multipliers would simply be the same expression divided by the length of your master alphabet. <br> <br>Practical example: <br> <br>The equation for the ATF Garamond alphabet length for the sizes 6-14 point is <br> <br>y = 7.8333x + 40 <br> <br>Here are the results of the equation: <br> <br>6 : 87 <br>8 : 102.667 <br>10 : 118.333 <br>12 : 134 <br>14 : 149.667 <br> <br>(The catalog gives 8 : 103, 10 : 118, and 14 : 149. I hope you will accept that the equation indeed fits the data if you allow for some rounding.) <br> <br>If you want these scaled to be equivalent to the 12-point, then the equation is <br> <br>y = 480/x + 94 There's your curve. <br> <br>If you want your multiplying ratio for ATF Garamond (12-point master), then just divide by 134. <br> <br>y = 3.582/x + 0.7015 <br> <br>The results: <br> <br>6 : 129.85% <br>8 : 114.93% <br>10 : 105.97% <br>12 : 100% <br>14 : 95.74% <br> <br>The differences between these numbers and yours go back to the rounding differences. <br> <br>All right, enough Math! We're scaring away all the art students! <br> <br>I've made my point. I don't think it's a higher order. Take it or leave it. <br> <br><i>>The point is for example that you can't interpolate (linearly) the 8 point number from the 12 and the 6.</i> <br> <br>The last thing I'll say on this is No, you can't interpolate the percentage linearly, but you <i>can</i> easily derive it from a linear interpolation. That's my basic point. <br> <br>Give me the length of a 6-point alphabet and a 12-point alphabet and I can easily derive the intermediates according to this ATF Garamond model, without any quadratic or cubic or any higher order math. Don't let those curves fool you. <br> <br>I'm not saying all the parameters are that way. But this one surely is. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Adding a comment to such an old thread, particularly one which contained a debate that had become acrimonious, may be unfortunate, but I hope that facts will calm things down rather than inflame them. (I had encountered this thread as the result of a web search for the original unit system for TTS fonts.)
The history of the legibility faces from Linotype was, I thought, well known. Alexander Lawson's "Anatomy of a Typeface" gives a good account of it. First there was Ionic No. 5, with low-contrast strokes and a generous x-height. Then there was Excelsior, which was designed to address a problem of ink-trapping that was observed in one particular case.
In high-speed rotary stereotype presses, the rubber rollers that applied the ink had to be made of harder material so that they could withstand more friction. It was at this point that ink-trapping became a problem that had to be addressed in Excelsior's design.
Not ink-trapping per se, but the need to apply ink more heavily so that halftone photographs would print properly, led to a flooding of counters with ink in tabloid newspapers: and so Paragon was designed.
Then a different problem - mold shrinkage - led to the design of Corona.
So while ink trapping was a real phenomenon, it only played a role briefly, and this was basically because presses were being operated in a way that could be expected to lead to poor results.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I came across another thread where it was noted by someone who worked for Linotype that their drawings of type were generally done to an 18-unit system or a 54-unit system, and that this became useful later on, when they came out with a phototypesetter that required this.
That came as a surprise to me, since indeed the Linotype mechanism makes no technical requirement for a unit system - since every space behaves like a quoin.
But this reminds me of something else. Given that the normal assortment of spaces and quads in a job case consists of em, en, 3-to-em, 4-to-em, and 5-to-em, plus the hairline space, and even the hairline space has a finite width, in my naivete, when first exposed to that I would have thought that even foundry type would have to be made to a unit system of 60 units to the em. If slugs of type had widths like pi/4 or sqrt(2)/2, they would drive typesetters to despair.
The favored explanation, though, was that the accuracy to which a line of type needed to be justified was finite, and just touching the sides of a slug would change its width due to one's sweat and the natural oils of one's skin and so on.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also, on the question of Linotype fonts being designed to a unit system:
This page,
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855719,00.html
notes that TIME magazine used TTS machines to operate Linotype casters during World War II because they needed to send identical copy to multiple printing plants. TIME, of course, was a magazine, not a newspaper, and I do not believe it was set in one of the newspaper legibility faces.
On this page,
http://www.gochipmunk.com/html/teletypeperforator1.html
a manual is quoted as saying that the use of TTS equipment to control Linotype machines has become a general practice.
I had thought that the multifont perforators were needed because even Corona wasn't designed with the same number of units per character as the TTS version of Ionic No. 5. That they could have been used to control Linotype machines setting magazines in Caledonia, however, appears not to be beyond the pale.
Of course, this still wasn't an intrinsic limitation of Linotype. Presumably, if indeed this did happen, Linotype started unitizing its fonts sometime in the 1930s, when the advantages of using TTS for other purposes than newswires became apparent.</div>

<div class=commentbody>TTS was used extensively in newspapers when I was a junior reporter in the 70s. The reason ... Linotypes were expensive, and had limited capacity. TTS punchers were cheaper, and you could have two (or more?) setters working on the TTS to feed one linesetter, optimizing the resource.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Exactly!
One of the original advantages of the Monotype system over Linotype was that the Monotype caster could be kept continuously busy, at an optimum speed, playing tapes generated on multiple Monotype keyboards.
The 18-unit system was a typographical disadvantage intrinsic to Monotype which Linotype did not share. On the other hand, Linotype had the disadvantage that Roman and Italic were normally identical in width (but bold was on separate matrices, and small caps were put in their own locations), and this was more noticeable.
When the TTS system was introduced for newspapers, it was noted that it allowed a Linotype machine to run more quickly and smoothly than one operated manually.
So, given that someone who used to work at Monotype noted that they were designing their fonts to an 18-unit system, what I think may have happened is the following:
Originally, when Linotype was first designed, what you see in the advertisements and the standard textbooks was right. Monotype had the unit system, Linotype had Roman and Italic equal in width.
After TTS was introduced, and people saw the *additional* benefit of how efficiently it made Linotype machines run, popular demand led to:
<ul>
<li>the creation of the "multifont keyboard" which could be set up to punch tapes based on different unit values for the letters than those standardized for the newspaper fonts, <em>and</em>
<li>Linotype making their matrices for fonts other than the newspaper legibility faces to an 18-unit system, so that those fonts would be usable with TTS.
</ul>
So even where paperbacks or magazines, instead of newspapers, were being set on Linotype, the machines could still be used as efficiently as Monotype casters, thanks to TTS being universally applicable.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite> > Linotype making their matrices for fonts other than the newspaper legibility faces to an 18-unit system, so that those fonts would be usable with TTS. </cite>
I think that you may be drawing a conclusion that is not completely warranted.
AFAIK, the Teletypesetter system of tape-driven composition did not intrinsically require unitized fonts.
The TTS system was, foremost, a standardized encoding system for tape perforation that facilitated long-distance [telegraph] transmission of keyed text.
Indeed, a side benefit is that this allowed tape-driven composition on an suitably equipped Linotype machine, similar to the benefit seen on a Monotype.
However, I believe that unitization is a separate issue.
The 18-unit system was an integral part of the Monotype matrix setup and its justification procedure. A unitized system allowed progressive calculation of the composed line and simplified the mechanical computation of space adjustment for justification.
The Linotype, on the other hand, relied upon a physical mechanism for line justification -- the tapered spaceband. So, unitization would not have benefited this process.
I have always understood that the purpose of a unitization spec as part of the TTS system was for standardization in newspaper syndication. Part of the original impetus for the development of TTS was a more efficient means of transmitting news stories. The addition of unitization standards would have allowed a story to set to a consistent measure and length in different newspapers with different body types.
This standardization would not have benefited book compositors.
As I understand it, the whole point of development of the Multiface Perforator was to work with non-unitized fonts and thus a different "counting" mechanism for engaging other operator functions.
What I do know for a fact, having spent some time analyzing the production drawings of Caledonia (drawn in 1937, well after the introduction of the TTS system), is that this book face was *not* drawn on an 18-unit system. Although I have not analyzed other designs as closely, I am highly skeptical that any other book faces were unitized either, prior to the introduction of Linotype's own unitized phototypesetting systems.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have just found out some additional information relvant to the question of whether or not Linotype fonts, needlessly from the standpoint of the Linotype mechanism, were unitized due to some external cause.
In the book "The Lithographer's Manual", I found that the Fairchild Multifont perforator was intended to allow Linotype machines to be operated through TTS to set fonts other than the newspaper legibility faces. However, this was achieved not just by allowing the character widths to be adjusted, but also by changing the unit system from 18 to the em to 32 to the em.
There was a posting on the Typophile forums where someone who worked at Linotype remembered they were drawing fonts there to an 18-unit system and then a 54-unit system, at least so that these fonts would be usable with their forthcoming phototypesetter products. No one remembers Linotype designing fonts to a 32-unit system.
The TTS system did have to calculate where each line would end. So the existing fonts, not recut, would have to be measured, and their widths - possibly rounded down, rather than up, so that errors would lead to excessively loose spacing, and never less-than-zero spacing - set on the TTS perforator.
So, basically, this confirms your statement: fonts didn't get cut to a unit system at Linotype in the '30s because of TTS; this only happened much later, when phototypesetting systems other than the imitation hot metal Fotosetter were on the horizon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>And I've learned something else from this. Having this table in hand, in the context of looking up information about Linotype legibility faces, led me to look at the Presswire faces for the Selectric Composer. Those faces had narrower numerals... so I thought I would check how well the narrower size matched the numerals used with TTS.
It turns out that the Presswire faces reduced the width of the numerals to 4 units (from the normal 6) in the Composer 9-unit system; but had they been reduced less severely, to 5 units, they would have been a closer match to the 9 unit numerals in the teletypesetter system.
@kentlew:
<cite>Nevertheless, I would guess that there was a standard established for each size of Art Line that determined the placement of the baseline on the body. That is, I would expect all fonts of the same size, cast on Art Line, to align with each other. Is this not so, Jim?</cite>
The system of lining used by ATF, and by other typefounders of that era as well, generally involved three standards.
There was the normal line (ATF: American line; Barnhart: Uniform line; Inland: Standard line), which allowed about 1/5 of the type body for descenders.
There was the Script or Art line (ATF: Art line; Barnhart: Text line; Inland: Script line), for authentic old style faces and script faces, which allowed about 1/3 of the type body for descenders.
And there was also a Titling line (ATF, Inland: Title line; Barnhart: Cap line) which allowed only a minimal area on the type body below the baseline.
Where necessary, increments of 1/2 point or even 1/4 point were used - for the very small type sizes, but the preference was for every size of type, in all three "lines", to have a distance from the baseline to the bottom of the type slug that differed from the distance from the baseline to the bottom of the type slug for every other size and style of type by a whole number of points.
So, using only standard leading material, in single points or half points where needed (and 1/4 point only in the extreme case of type at 6 points or less), one could align the baselines of any face with any other, even if one was Art line and the other Standard line, and whatever their point sizes might be. That was why they called it 'lining' type.
In the Didot system, Bauer, and probably others, did much the same thing. The baseline might be 1.4 Didones above the bottom of the type body for one size of type, and 2.9 Didones above it for another; what counted was that the difference was 1.5 Didones, a multiple of half of a Didot point.</div>
