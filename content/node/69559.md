  but I have a client that has given a lot of things to deal with on this one. This
  is a re-brand of an architecture firm that has a current logo that they are not
  happy with for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Their current logo is outdated and
  they are finding themselves bound to the \"square\" in all uses and many times it
  leaves the company name too small to even be legible. They find that they often
  blow the \"square\" up so large it is ridiculous just to see the company name.\r\n\r\n2.
  They would like carry over some element of the current logo to make it identifiable.\r\n\r\n3.
  They are hesitant to introduce a plant or leaf because they don't want to be mistaken
  for a landscape contractor and fear the line is thin to slip into something not
  professional enough. They are willing to explore a plant element if it is \"artistic\"
  or \"architectural\" in nature (their words).\r\n\r\n4. Since they are in the design
  industry they probably could design their own logo like many architects do so they
  are going to be more particular\r\n\r\n5. They would like an icon as part of their
  new logo, something they can use in presentation material or as a watermark\r\n\r\nSo
  you can see that the creative box is a bit smaller than usual and I am going nuts
  with this one. Any comments or direction is greatly appreciated! Here are some initial
  quick concepts:"

  body: "Some ideas that comes to mind.\r\nType: maybe something a bit more geometric
    could help.\r\nWhen I think of \"landscape\", I think something mostly horizontal
    with some vertical elements. Their original logo is too vertical.\r\nThey should
    give you some visuals of their work you could use as inspiration.\r\nIf you rotate
    the k in your last attempt (Box1c) 90\xB0 counterclockwise, you have an horizontal
    landscape with a very abstract (dare I say, architectural) tree in it."

  body: "I think that architecture firm needs more robust/stable/technical logo. Their
    current logo is nice, stable, square, firm...\r\n\r\nTo me 2B and 1A seem the
    most promising. Especially 2B. 1A has too strong an emphasized  type and should
    be loosened a bit. While changing type to normal weight, you could also widen
    character spacing when using all caps. It could make it even more \"posh\", because
    you can afford space. Anyway. I don't think too organic logos will be well accepted
    by your strictly technical clients."

  body: "The mark you have in 2b is better than any of the others. Pardon my harsh
    criticism, but the mark in 1, 1a & 1b is dreadful. \r\n\r\nIf you decide to go
    the plant / leaf route, I get the feeling they'd like something that vibes with
    this: http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Robinsson-Cravents-Identity/173877 \u2014
    Geometrical, architectural, and mathematical even."

  body: "Thank you all for your input. I definitely think I have too many options
    on the table because even in 5 responses there is direct opposite views, but I
    guess that's what makes design so interesting, it's all in the eye of the beholder.
    \r\n\r\npenn & ink, thank you for the directness of what you thought about the
    mark in 1/1a/1b. Their company tag line is \"Imagine. Create. Live.\" The 3 petals
    or leaflets were meant to represent each of these in the case that they want to
    use the mark/icon with just the tag line. Sometimes I find myself getting too
    caught up in satisfying these types of things and then when all is said and done
    I stand back and look at the logo and think \"what the hell was I thinking?\"
    \r\n\r\nAs for the client's eye, they are attracted to the horizontal layout of
    the text in 2b but think \"Landscape Architects\" is too long to be sharing a
    single line with \"southwick\". They also feel like that text arrangement is all
    too common among architects as well. While they like the horizontal feel in 2b
    they also dislike the icon in 2b the most of any. They feel it looks like something
    that represents a hotel/resort or would be found on a complimentary bar of soap...haha,
    I can't argue that!\r\n\r\nThey are most attracted to the idea of Agave1c but
    aren't sold on stacking \"landscape\" over \"architects\" on one side like that.
    They also have concerns about the square fighting for attention with the free
    flow of the agave plant. Here are some other options on Agave1c that may help
    resolve those issues.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Agave1c-rnd2_6303.gif]"

  body: "this is becoming better but as mentioned before in my post (I forgot to say
    that 1A I was referring to should actually be <strong>Box1A</strong> because there
    is more than just one 1A). Anyway.\r\n\r\nI would use normal weight Gill Sans
    in \"southwick\". The same would then be applied to the box/line that derives
    it's weight from letter weight.\r\n\r\nPlant stylisation may as well be a bit
    confusing. Lines are also way to thin in some parts. Experiment some more with
    plant if you really need it. I wouldn't use it anyway. Or make it more \"sans
    serif\" with uniweight strokes..."

  body: "Well, I have met with the client a couple of different times since this update
    and they have reverted to wanting something more simple. They have thrown out
    all concepts at this point that have any plant mark involved and would rather
    stick to holding on to their box of the current logo somehow. They have also come
    up with a new tag line and would like to see it incorporated with the logo.\r\n\r\nI
    feel like these are too plain now and don't set them apart as anything different.
    These could be anyone's logo and I am having a hard time believing that after
    all of this process that these are what they would truly be happy with.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SLA-B_3626.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SLA-D_5051.gif]"

    the periods have to be in the 'tagline'? I'm so over that trend of false punctuation.
    I'd either go with midpoints or nothing at all between them.\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>penn</em>"
