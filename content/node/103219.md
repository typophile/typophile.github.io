body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've come into a problem whilst trying to compile a font which contains
  some Japanese characters.\r\nI have a basic Latin character set (MacOS Roman encoding),
  but with some additional unicode characters such as uni6782, uni571F \u2013 these
  total around 20 different characters.\r\n\r\nThe font compiles fine from Fontlab,
  and the characters are accessible in (All on Mac OSX 10.8)  TextEdit, Adobe InDesign
  CS3->CS6, as well as OpenOffice. However, when I try and type these characters (via
  a japanese keyboard layout) or paste them in, the font reverts to a default system
  font which contains the characters.\r\n\r\nIs there a certain Japanese name I need
  to apply for Microsoft Office (Word 14.2.0) Mac?\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTerry\r\n"

    ranges enabled in the font. Word is also probably expecting the font to be monospaced
    if you have used the usual Unicode ranges for these glyphs. \r\n\r\nMalcolm"
