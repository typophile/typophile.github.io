  the site after seeing someone wearing a really cool typography shirt they bought
  from Typophile.\r\n\r\nAnyways...\r\n\r\nMy name is Taylor but some people like
  to call me Spoon for some reason.  I'm currently a graphic design student so I'm
  just trying to soak up all that I can about typography and good graphic design.
  \ I get made fun (in a semi-joking manor) for looking at letters and typography
  and comparing different typefaces to each other, but I don't care too much about
  what they think.  I'm currently trying to learn enough about different fonts so
  that I can spot them in public places.  So, this looks like a great place for me
  to learn.\r\n\r\nNow the big question....where can I get one of those really cool
  tshirts?  The store just looks like it has a few posters.\r\n\r\n"

    is probably the best place to find the widest assortment of cool type t's anywhere
    in the lower 48. \r\n\r\n"
