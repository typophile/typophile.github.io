    sure it will stick out on the Best Buy endcap, so I guess the design is at least
    successful from a pragmatic standpoint.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, mainstream album
    covers were better when they could have tits. Damn the Walton family for their
    backward ways\u2026"

    cover is featured. There's a double double spread of a large mandala and several
    other works featured. I'll get some pics in the daylight.\r\n"

  body: Boy, does that feel tacked on. Would it have killed their budget to hire a
    lettering artist to do it right? Sad.

    works featured.</em>\r\n\r\nWould that be the <em>Lotus</em> album cover? I still
    remember borrowing that from a high school pal and being blown away by the whole
    package -- the music, the artwork, the continuous recording fading in and out
    at the beginning and end of each LP's sides."
