  on a visuals for a student film festival and i wanted to use some of those friendly
  geometric rounded sans serif fonts. i was looking for something bit quirky but logic
  and as simple as possible and i din't want it to be oddly bumpy, because lots of
  the fonts form this category are. i also didn't want the geometric construction
  to be the most prominent feature of the font.\r\ni was looking for something like
  that, but i didn't find anything that would match my criteria... so in the end,
  i decided not to do compromises and draw something myself.\r\nthis is the result
  and i think it works very nice. i'm using it for titles and headlines in the visual,
  not for text. the image above is from a cd cover proposal i did with the font. please,
  let me know what you think about it, so i can take it further and maybe design the
  whole family? or if you think there's no more room for this kind of typeface, let
  me know as well.\r\n\r\nthanks. ondrej"

  body: "Looks really nice! Good work!\r\nThere are a few things I think I'd correct
    \u2014 I'm not an expert by any means so take my words as pointers and not facts...
    :)\r\nI think you need to do a slight bit of optical correction. Although this
    is a monoline design, the eye sees vertical and horizontal strokes differently,
    which means you need to compensate in the design to make it look optically monoline.
    I'm trying to find Mark Jamra's article on optical correction but getting a 404
    error. Anyway, the verticals need a few units thicker strokes, as well as the
    3 and 9 o'clock positions on round glyphs.\r\nI notice you've added overshoot
    on the round glyphs; but you also need a little on the round baseline terminals,
    so they look on the same baseline as for example the bottom stroke of L.\r\nCrossbar
    of G looks a bit long? M is rather narrow.\r\nI guess your tittles are intentionally
    rather large but I find them a bit distracting, though I do like the inky effect.\r\nHave
    you tried a different design for Kk? \r\nArches of m look a bit dark.\r\nLowercase
    u looks a bit wide and y looks a bit sheared to the right somehow.\r\nNumerals
    are really nice. 9 looks disproportioned though.\r\nSpacing needs a bit of work
    to even out.\r\n\r\nLook forward to seeing this progress. :)"

  body: "hi bendy, thank you for your comments!\r\ni am very well aware of the optical
    problems with fonts and i already did make some corrections in the version you
    saw on the pdf. the rings are thicker on the sides, many of the horizontals are
    thinner, but now i see that it's probably not enough. this was a four-afternoons
    work and i didn't have chance to print a single proof, so i'll trust you on this.
    \r\nyou are right, there are no overshoots on the rounded endings of the strokes.
    the thing is i needed to get this done very quickly, so i used round upm values
    for almost everything. the overshoot is 10, the thickness of the verticals is
    100 and the horizontals are 95 :) all these will need some more work and tuning,
    however on the other hand, this roughness along with the big tittles and numbers
    gave the font quite nice character.\r\ni'll examine closely the letters you mentioned.
    many of the proportions are based on the \"simplicity\" principle i tried to apply
    to this font. that's why the M is the same width as N, or K & k are designed the
    way they are. 9 is a special case, i agree, it looks disproportioned, but only
    when it stands alone. in a group with other figures, it really adds life to the
    image, what do you think?\r\nthank you very much again, i'll try to post updated
    version asap.\r\ncheers, ondrej."

  body: "Hmm, I do like the simple, inexact texture. It gives a nice printy, inky
    feel, with much more character than the standard rounded geometric fonts out there.
    It'll be interesting to see how you reconcile the liveliness with optical balance.
    \r\n\r\nI think your word space is a little on the narrow side and the emdash
    looks low. (But that could also add charm of course.)"

  body: "This is great stuff. Especially the tittles :-)\r\nI love its balance between
    being quite clean, and very personable/likeable.\r\n\r\nSome impressions (but
    bear in mind I'm not the most experienced type designer in the room):\r\n- I wonder
    if \"f\" seems a bit unhappy with the centered crossbar. Did you try making it
    shorter on the left (kind of like in the \"t\")?\r\n- \"m\": Due to the way the
    stem/arch joins work, the first one is more tapered/thinned than the second. Not
    sure if that works \u2013 seems a bit imbalanced.\r\n- I agree with Bendy that
    the crossbar of \"G\" seems long.\r\n- \"M\" is a bit on the narrow side (then
    again, the intersection *is* high).\r\n- Joins in \"V\"/\"W\" might be a bit dark.\r\n-
    The di\xE6reses might be *too* overpowering, but I'd have to see them in context.\r\n-
    The bottom part of the germandbls is too wide; it doesn't (and usually can't)
    be the same width as the \"s\".\r\n- The \"loop\" formed where the 2 glyphs meet
    in the \"ct\", \"sp\" and \"st\" ligatures looks a bit alien to me, in the sense
    that suddenly a \"stroke\" and \"pen direction\" can be felt. Compare to the typographic/\"directionless\"
    rigidity of the other ligatures (which I think works better). I think I'd ditch
    the \"loop\" and try a simple shear.\r\n\r\nBut most of all please do keep working
    on this. I'd love to have it, for one :-)"

    serif, the straight arm of the r, the dingbats and especially the numerals.\r\n\r\nI
    think your optical correction for the rounds is just right. It's only the straight
    horizontals that could stand a tiny bit more thinning.\r\n\r\nThe S, though...
    The S is noticeably top-heavy and and leaning to the right."
