  body: "I think the problem is that we don't know what it is you're going for: contrast,
    harmony? What's the piece for, what's the feeling?\r\n\r\nI have a hard time understanding
    why you're using Letter Gothic for body copy (unless it's short), but perhaps
    Franklin Gothic for titles? .... unless you're looking for contrast, in which
    case you the field is wide open. You could go with a fifties script, for example.\r\n\r\nYou
    might look at something like Unit, which has a broad range of weights, and could
    be used instead of Letter Gothic, and might be an improvement, IMHO."

    in Letter Gothic, which looks quite good. For your project you might look at Meta
    Condensed ... or as John Nolan mentioned \u2013 Unit.\r\n"
