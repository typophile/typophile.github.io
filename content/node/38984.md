body: "Hope this is the right forum.\r\n\r\nWhile I like all the things that go with
  the concept of typography, I much prefer just looking at typefaces by themselves.
  In groups of thousands, sad to say.\r\n\r\nI especially love sans  typefaces, leaning
  more toward those appropriate for fair amounts of text. That said, I've seen a crapload
  of them, which means I've gawked at everything from Agro Sans to the font \"Protocol\"
  appearing in something published by the Univ. of Minnesota and featuring an interview
  with Peter Bil\xB4ak.\r\n\r\nSo is there anyone here who could direct me toward
  some of the more obscure sans faces, or perhaps those unique to businesses not in
  the Fortune 500? I have literally spent years trudging through the web on this endless
  search, many times ending with me going \"oh my, look at that! That's beautiful.\"
  Which as I just realized makes me sound like Captain Moron because I probably could
  have been looking in the same way for women.\r\n\r\n(As he snaps out of it ...)
  Anyway,  I would greatly appreciate it - I realize no one knows whether I've seen
  certain fonts or not, which is why I tried to create a pseudo-boundary by saying
  I've seen a god-awful lot of them. The most recent being one called \"Nexus\" (not
  FF Nexus) used by Bus Atha Cliath in Ireland, if that's any help."

    that's beautiful but exclusive.\r\n\r\nHave a gander at http://www.typebase.com
    and open every single link in tabs, save the tabs, and refer back to the tabs.
    Go through every link thoroughly every now and then. Safari lets you open many
    links at a time. You will discover many gems.\r\n\r\nFor even more obscure stuff:
    the best resource ever!\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/fonts.html\r\n\r\nMyfonts.com
    has the goods too.\r\n\r\nHope I helped you.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Mike, I visited that site (www.typebase.com) and clicked the first thing
    I saw (Arion Press). On their main page I saw, <em>\"Just released: The first
    illustrated edition of T. S. Eliot's landmark 20th century poem, The Waste Land,
    with artwork by R. B. Kitaj, and an essay by Helen Vendler.\"</em> I clicked the
    photo of the book, but instead of Waste Land I found <em>Journey Round My Room</em>,
    by Xavier de Maistre.\r\n\r\nReading about this book I came to this line, <em>\"The
    initial letters and display type on the title page are Gallia, produced by Lanston
    Monotype in 1928. This face was chosen because of its striping of thin-thick-thin
    lines and is printed in rose ink because of the preference of the author for bed-hangings
    in this color and pattern.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThis led me to search out [[http://www.linotype.com/155925/monotypegallia-family.html|Gallia]]
    and what a marvelously old and elegant font. While I'll never be able to splurge
    for any of these books (or even a fraction of the fonts) I can see I'll be spending
    a lot of time on this site goggling and dreaming."

    faces. Do you need them for a specific project you're working on? Here are a few
    off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights/\">Flama</A>
    Maybe not \"obscure\" but not used so much in the U.S. as far as I know.\r\n\r\n<A
    HREF=\"http://www.fsd.it/fonts/cp.htm\">CP Company</A>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.typecuts.com/fonts.php?kid=2\">Wedding
    Sans</A>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/index.php?lmut=en&part=fonts&sub=category&id=1\">Suitcase
    Type</A> There are a few faces just released from this guy. Good stuff."

    This is a more complete list of links to the actual foundries- but that's not
    to say that peripheral links won't get you somewhere intersting too.\r\n\r\nMikey

  body: "Thanks everyone for the information provided so far; I've pretty much seen
    all of these sites/fonts hundreds of times which is a sad commentary maybe but
    something I still enjoy nevertheless.\r\n\r\nI am not seeking \"less-popular\"
    fonts per se, just those hidden gems and treasures that have eluded me. And not
    for any project ... just to appreciate them. Also, I did see the new Suitcase
    Type fonts and you're right, they are quite nice.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I could describe
    a few of the more attractive ones I've seen lately:\r\n\r\n1.) Technotipo, by
    Luciano Perondi and Mauro Carichini: I absolutely love this font but only have
    been able to view its bold weight thus far. See it here: http://www.molotro.com/tec.html\r\n\r\n2.)
    Tarasu, by Jennifer Lorch, Tronje by Linda Wulf, and Debut by Ruwen Kopp, et.
    al.: These can be viewed here: www.vtriad.de/dl/typo_wbericht.pdf \r\n\r\n3.)
    Adressa, by Tibe-T, actual designer unknown: See it here: www.adressa.no/konsern/rapporter/norsk/pdf/2007/1Kn_2007.pdf\r\n\r\nAny
    others like these?"
