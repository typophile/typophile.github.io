    At some point Apple's iEverything brand is going to lose steam and the company
    is going to be be stuck renaming a whole lot of products. Then again, maybe that's
    the plan\u2014wait for people to get bored, and then have eighteen months of keynotes
    about software and hardware that's just so cool it <em>had</em> to have a new
    name. "

    more bummed that the AppleTV didn't have DVR capabilities. "
