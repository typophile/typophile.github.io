body: Hi, <BR>I&#39;m a student working on a logo for a personal identity project.  I&#39;m
  attempting a playful, hand-drawn treatment of my name as a logo. Before I move on
  to using color, I am trying to address a couple of issues. <BR> <BR>First, something
  seems a little &#34;off&#34; about my letter forms. I cannot seem to put my finger
  on it, and I was hoping some of the more trained eyes here could help me out.  <BR>
  <BR>Secondly, I think the logo should be for &#39;Jason Yates Design&#34; not just
  &#34;Jason Yates&#34;, as just my name seems a little too personal. I would like
  to hear some thoughts on that, and if my treatment of the additional line of text
  is appropriate. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33432.gif"

  body: Quick thoughts... <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve obviously got the ability to hand letter
    your name -- why stop with that and use a pre-built font for &#34;Design&#34;?
    Why not hand letter that, too, and tie it in with the first two words?

    in Yates? <BR>&#34;Yates&#34; looks darker than J&#34;ason&#34;

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;for some reason, it never
    occoured to me to do the word design in same way as the letters.. <BR> <BR>I have
    quickly added the word &#39;design&#39;, it still needs a little more tweaking.
    <BR> <BR>I agree that &#39;ason&#39; was lighter than the rest, so I have bulked
    them up a bit..  <BR> <BR>I am playing with the horizontal line in &#34;ate&#34;.
    I have tried curving it up and down &#40;top and bottom right&#41;.  Maybe I need
    to walk away for this for a while, because no one of the three really stands out
    &#40;although none of them seem bad to me, either&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33437.gif"

  body: Jason, I like the unifying quality that the common stroke has through A, T,
    and E, but it&#39;s easy to see &#34;Yales&#34; instead. Or &#34;Tates&#34; for
    that matter. <BR> <BR>You might want to further distinguish the Y by making the
    bowl of the J smaller or perhaps changing to a script-style &#40;right-side spine&#41;
    Y.  <BR> <BR>Had you considered making the lc &#34;ate&#34; more script-style,
    with a monocular a whose tail connected to the body of the t rather than the cross?
    You could connect the A and T at the baseline and the T and E using the cross.

  body: I think it makes much more sense to have the &#34;design&#34; as a font, to
    offset the playfulness of the &#34;Jason Yates&#34;. The former is a craft, the
    latter is a person, so that makes for a nicely expressed duality. And of the three
    you have up there, Eurostile is best, although it seems a bit too rigid &#40;and
    too light&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Jason -- as a cartoonist, I have the feeling that your logo says cartoonist
    more than it does designer. Lettering is difficult to get just right and if you
    don&#39;t, you shoot yourself in the foot. Here are a couple of samples of very
    good lettering in the style you&#39;ve used, though they are lighter in weight.
    Get the feeling for the complete alphabet and be careful of hooking letters together
    unless you can do it in a pleasing way. Witty is even better. I suppose I must
    say that these examples appear courtesy of the advertisers who commissioned them.

  body: thanks for all of your input so far, <BR> <BR>What paul said about the logo
    looking more like a cartoonist&#39;s logo really struck me as a problem, and I
    may need to re-examine the logo. What good would a designer be if their logo can&#39;t
    even convey properly what they do? <BR> <BR>I will go back and try something in
    the same spirit as what I have now, but says &#39;design&#39; more than &#39;doodle&#39;

  body: I just wanted to show this one, it&#39;s one last crack at it before I step
    away from this for a bit. I have tried revising these forms, and they all come
    out either too caligraphic, or begin to look too rigid. <BR> <BR>Here, I have
    taken many of your suggestions, switching the &#39;y&#39;, and playing with how
    I connect the letters. I need to distance myself from this for a while, and decide
    what I&#39;m doing. I like these current forms, but I&#39;m not sure how appropriate
    they look. I appreciate any comments on this. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33498.gif"
