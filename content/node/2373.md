body: I just thought we could discuss a bit about monolined since it&#39;s still a
  contemporary type trend. We know some people love it and others just think it&#39;s
  too easy. This thread is open to all opinions. <BR> <BR>What about if we also try
  to create a list of the best types in this movement? <BR> <BR>Is Lineto a reference
  with their Gravur Condensed and simple? And about MM Paris?  <BR> <BR>Drop us your
  opinion here. <BR> <BR>thank you  <BR>Helder <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/22236.gif"

  body: An interesting &#34;r&#34; but I had to reference it in the words to make
    out what it was. <BR> <BR>&#34;m&#34; looks poor at small sizes &#40;look in top-right
    corner in the WARNING area, the words &#34;minors&#34; and &#34;<a href="mailto:hardcore@norm.to">hardcore@norm.to</a>&#34;
    have weird looking &#34;m&#34;s. Although for some reason I have no problem with
    the &#34;m&#34; in &#34;may&#34;.&#41; <BR> <BR>I really like the font though,
    especially how well different bolds work together.

  body: Huh. Lineto.com has some interesting offerings. Just wish I could force CSS
    to render these fonts into a website. Yeah, I know Flash will do it, but...  <BR>
    <BR>Just thinking out loud...

    <BR>You can deliver fonts to the bulk of web users by embedding them using MS&#39;s
    WEFT/EOT technology. You&#39;ll need to sniff for non-supporting browsers though
    to avoid a mess. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
