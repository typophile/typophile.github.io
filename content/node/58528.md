  font without the serifs. Does anyone know if this font is available? Can you suggest
  a similar looking font? Attached image is from their blog and is the largest image
  I could find. Sorry!\r\n\r\nKristin[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LibertyofLondonlogo_5489.jpg]"

  body: "No, it isn't Liberty. As I said in my post, it is lacking the serifs you
    find on Liberty. That was the point of my post. I'm sorry that was unclear.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a slightly larger version here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.liberty.co.uk/\r\n\r\nIf
    you compare it with the liberty you linked, you'll see that the serifs have been
    snipped off. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you would agree that the only difference is the clipped serifs, then I
    think we can say \"slightly modified Liberty\" is the answer. It was a little
    harder to see the missing serifs the way the above image was cropped. It shows
    up better on the web page.At the low screen resolution it's even possible that
    the serifs just aren't showing up against the black background (I thought).\r\n\r\n

  body: "Mike, you are misunderstanding the point of my post.\r\n\r\nI'm not questioning
    your font identification. I knew what the font was based on when I began my original
    post. See how I mention that the logo is \"Linotype's liberty font without the
    serifs\". That's me saying the logo is based on Liberty, that Liberty is owned
    by Linotype, but that the logo uses an altered version \"without the serifs\".\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to assume that there is no font available and I'll look into purchasing
    font alteration from Linotype if I my creative team wants to pay the fees.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n\r\n\r\n"
