  but i have solved my Alienware graphics driver issue myself (no f'n help from Nvidia
  or Alienware). I found a webiste that let's me download a .ini file that let's the
  updated Nvidia Vista graphics driver recognize my graphics card and install. \r\n\r\nfull

  body: ">Why not just sidestep the problem and switch to Mac?\r\n\r\nI think Vinnie
    and the article's authors problems relate to upgrades. Buying a new machine would
    seem to be cheating. But if you want a new machine to run Vista then a Mac would
    likely be a good choice. "

    is really off topic, but since you question my software knowledge, I must clarify.\r\n\r\nThe
    above image is currently what Photoshop CS 2 spits out on my PC. It looks similar
    for Microsoft products. Here's the challenge / question: Why can't this list,
    within any program using common user-interface elements, have an organizable folder-font
    list?\r\n\r\nBack on subject, it seems Vista also spits out a linear list of fonts."
