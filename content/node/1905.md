  difficult to read? All the s&#39;s are upside-down. =&#41;

    \"Tikki Tikki Tembo\", set in (14pt?) Weiss. The s is upside-down, but I find
    the typeface elegant and distinguished."

  body: I like Weiss although I don't use it very often. I don't have much use for
    serif fonts that lack expert sets.

  body: I think the "up-side down" effect in Weiss is balanced indeed and the typeface
    is very pleasent to read as body copy (my own opinion though). Rerading the first
    Swedish edition of Lord of the Rings (all set in Weiss of course) made me design
    my latest typeface Anziano. The only problem I have with Weiss is the italic which
    is to far away from the upright design.

  body: "It's nice to see the classics used in children's books.\r\nI particularly
    appreciate the simplicity and the large sizes.\r\n\r\nAnother book my son borrowed
    recently, \"Someone bigger\", was set in Veljovic, which I have not seen in a
    while, and it was gorgeous.\r\n\r\n(btw, these young readers texts are enjoyable
    without osf, ligatures, and fractions, which we otherwise hold dear).\r\n\r\nbest,"

  body: "I remember reading Tikki Tikki Tembo during my early elementary school years.
    Was about a Chinese boy with a longish name (Tikki-Tikki-Tembo-no-sa-rembo-chari-bari-ruchi-pip-peri-pembo),
    which got him into all sorts of trouble, I believe. I don't recall exactly what,
    but a quick google search should reveal all. In any case the moral of the story
    was that Chinese names are short for a good reason. \r\n\r\nStefan: \r\n\r\nI
    saw Anziano and duly printed out the pdf. I plan on investing in that face as
    soon as I add your Tarocco extended set to the original set I already have. I
    prefer Anziano over Delicato, actually. It seems that Anziano is the synthesis
    of your experiences with Tarocco and Delicato. Which is not a problem for users
    of Tarocco, I think. I find that I prefer the increased x-height of Tarocco anyway.
    And the extra features will sweeten the collection, surely.\r\n\r\nLuminance looks
    interesting. It's a bit quirky at larger sizes, but it looks extremely legible.
    Czech type (right?) usually has interesting idiosyncracies. StormType does alot
    of fine work with that sort of thing, as I'm sure you know.  "

  body: "Christian,\r\n\r\nThanks for kind words about Anziano and Luminance. Anziano
    is a typical text face and works best for books and magazines. Luminance on the
    other hand is more of a \"text/display\" oriented typeface. It probably needs
    a specific headline weight to work properly in larger sizes. And yes it its roots
    is from the Czech tradition. I find a lot of inspirtaion from that part of Europe.
    Storm is an excellent foundry, btw. They make wonderful typefaces.\r\n\r\nCheers"
