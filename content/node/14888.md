body: "Hi,\r\nI'm considering typefaces for a magazine design and wonder if anyone
  keeps ApexSans and/or ApexSerif and would be so kind to send a sample PDF with some
  text for reviewing purposes. It would be great to see at least regular, medium and
  bold of these in body text.\r\n"

  body: "Apex is very good. If you have not yet compared to other squared-off sans,
    you want to compare these:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless\">Stainless</a>,
    which has a big variety of widths and weights for magazine work. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html\">Kalvika</a>,
    my favorite at the moment,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=24&subpage=viewfonts\">Simian</a>,
    which is very well done but rather wide\r\n\r\nand the new <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/elektra.html\">Elektra</a>\r\n\r\nalso
    Sophisto at http://www.macrhino.com/.\r\n\r\nI know you can get PDFs at the sites
    for Stainless, Klavika and Elektra and Sophisto at the sites, and I'm sure more
    from all the foundries. \r\n\r\nI'd be interested in your choice and why you made
    it. "

  body: "I knew of Klavika, which I agree is great, and Elektra looks interesting-though
    Storm provide a non-printable PDF!?\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I'm very interested
    in ApexSans/Serif is that the project I'm working on requires all texts in 3 languages
    on the same page, so I was considering using the serif for one language."

    Apex''s serif version is better. '

  body: Apex gets a little clogged in the bold weights. I recommend <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=LH.108102.0.0">PMN
    Caecilia</a> as an alternative.

    body: i tend to agree with Stephen regarding the bold weights. I think it works
      far best in light and book, which is also the only weights i use. But in those
      weights it's absolutely gorgeous I think...!

  body: Apex light has some beautiful qualities, though everytime I use it I have
    to factor in time to correct the kerning. This can be all consuming when you are
    dealing with paragraphs of text.

  body: "Thanks all for your help and comments - very useful indeed.\r\nI got in touch
    with Chester, as Stephen recommended, and he has been extremely helpful. He's
    working on a v.2 of Apex, and he mentions that he's paying particular attention
    to fixing the bolder weights. So he seems to be aware of the problems commented
    here.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFredrik"
