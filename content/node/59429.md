body: "Hello everybody --\r\n\r\nI went to my computer today to do some work and found
  that a substantial chunk of my typeface library -- approximately 1,800 fonts --
  had been turned into .xml files and hidden in the \"Jaws\" folder of Quark XPress.
  \ I have no idea how or when or why this happened, and I have no idea how to fix
  it.  Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n--Jim K.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Or
  possibly they had been deleted and the .xml files are left over from something else??
  \ I really have no clue here.  :("

    you use a font manager (I assume you do, with that many fonts)? Do you have a
    recent backup?\r\n\r\nSounds like your file directory(ies) may be screwed up --
    bigger problem than just your fonts.  Try disk utility(s) and see if that works,
    or at least finds a problem."

  body: "Not a lot of info to run off of (no system specs) - but can you think of
    anything that has recently changed on your computer system? Any new applications
    installed? Any recent updates? Font files don't turn into XML without a reason.
    Can you open the XML files with a text-editor? Don't save them after opening them
    but take a look and see if you can see anything of interest. Isn't Jaws the not-officially-licensed-post-script-renderer?
    Maybe Jaws is converting the fonts - you might check your settings in Quark for
    that. Also use a web search to see if anybody else has run into something similar.\r\n\r\nAt
    any rate, good luck and I hope you can figure out what's happening and how to
    recover from it."

  body: "I'm running Mac OS X v. 10.4.1.  Disk Utility doesn't spot any problems.
    \ Opening one of the xml files shows something like the following:\r\n\r\n/Gentium
    \ (%psfont%Gentium) (r) file << /ResourceType /sfnt\r\n >> /ResourceDecode filter\r\n
    definesfntfontset 0 get definefont pop\r\n\r\n...which says to me that this wasn't
    a conversion but that it was left over from some other processes, and the fonts
    have been deleted somehow.\r\n\r\n:(\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help anyway,\r\n\r\n--Jim"
