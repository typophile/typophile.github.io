  specifically, the <a href=\"http://www.iampeth.com/books/portfolio_of_ornate_penmanship/portfolio_page19.html\">top
  design on this page</a>, as well as the quite similar <a href=\"http://www.iampeth.com/books/portfolio_of_ornate_penmanship/portfolio_page17.html\">centre
  design on this page</a>.\r\n\r\nWould these be considered bastarda scripts? ( At
  least, I don't think they're rotunda.)\r\n\r\nWhile some of the details are different,
  I suspect they're based on the same calligraphic pattern, at least ultimately.  Does
  anyone know of a typeface that uses the same pattern/design?  I'm not specifically
  searching for one; I'm considering making a typeface out of one or the other (or
  a combination of the two) and was just curious how close it would come to duplicating
  existing work.\r\n"

  body: Amazing! Where is the |I| in this second sample (see top and middle one)?
    It looks like it's a |JK| ligature. There are only 25 caps letters out there.
