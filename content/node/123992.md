  guys, do you happen to know what fonts are used in these logo? both the script and
  san serif font on the first logo (Australia on the back of a truck) and zezzco.
  The Australia one is more important though, I just kinda squished the other one
  in.\r\n\r\nThank you. Please help."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ColossalisBoldAsAustralia_6285.gif] Good
    find Fivos. An effective design by Aldo Novarese that has the feeling of something
    really big and lives up to the name Colossalis.\r\nI agree that distressed versions
    of digital fonts created by another digital fontmaker are of very questionable
    legality. I know that if I was a the owner of the rights to Colossalis, and had
    the financial resources to protect the IP rights, I would sue anyone who used
    a distressed version in a commercial project without seeking my permission.\r\nDon"
