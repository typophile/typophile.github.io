  said something along the lines of, \"I hate the saying 'less is more' because that
  still supposes that more is better. I prefer 'less is less'.\"\r\n\r\nI know my
  description was rather vague, but does anyone recall this quote?\r\n\r\nw j f"

    just more. Less is better. \"\r\n\r\nI think it got shorted and obfuscated to
    \"less is more.\""

    can easily be verified in the terminal using <code> ls -l /usr/bin </code>.

    Less is NOT a bore [3]. Less is less. \"Less is More\" is probably the single
    most destructive phrase to come out of the modernist architectural lexicon. The
    poetry of Mies was mis-interpreted and mis-used by building developers who used
    the phrase to justify stripping buildings of all significant meaning as objects
    of art in order to build as cheaply as possible.</em>"
