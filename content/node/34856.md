  of two single fonts (light and bold) have to be compatible in order to use them
  as masters? Do I have to use the blend tool to build the multiple masters or there\xB4s
  other way to do it? If yes, is it inevitable that the original shapes change even
  a little...? \r\n\r\nSorry if i\xB4m not making any sense.\r\n\r\nThanks In advance\r\nBest
  regards"

  body: "The more compatible the outlines are in advance, the better.\r\nIn fact the
    Blend tool gives the most reliable results, <cite>because</cite> it may add nodes
    to the original outlines.\r\nThe point of MM is that the node structure of each
    master is identical. So deleting a node in one master means deleting it in the
    other master too. Just like in a single master glyph, each outlines has a certain
    number of nodes -- but in a MM glyph, each node does not hold just one x-y-coordinate
    per node, but for every node there is one x-y-coordinate per master."

  body: "ok, i see what you mean... \r\nthanks for the reply\r\n\r\nThis is what happens
    when i blend them to build the MM...\r\nThe left ones are the originals, now look
    how diferent they get after that! Is this normal? Is this the right way to do
    things or am i doing something wrong? Could it be the point plancement on the
    rounded corners that causes this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5636.jpg]"

  body: "Seems there are two problems.\r\n \r\nThe first (and main one) is that the
    start nodes sit at different places. I'd use the position of the black weight
    for the light weight too. Obviously, FLS tried to reposition them, but since there
    seem to be other outline-incompatibilities, it inserted points and moved others
    around ...\r\n[On Mac, Ctrl-Alt-T will highlight start nodes and contour numbers;
    in the light font, click on the point which shall become start node; then double
    click somewhere into the Glyph Window to leave this special mode. After re-positioning
    the start node you should click on the former start node and delete it; undo if
    the point is really gone after that! Point is: sometimes a former start node consists
    of two overlapping nodes instead of just one, which would also destroy the outline
    compatibility. \r\nAlternatively, you can run the Correct Start Node script which
    ships with Adobe's AFDKO -- on both the original light and black fonts, before
    blending them.]\r\n\r\nThe second problem may be 'kinking', especially with the
    differently angled diagonals in the 2 -- you should see one of Thomas Phinney's
    presentations on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he can give some more information
    since he's the MM expert.\r\nSome information are in the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/font/pdfs/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf\"

  body: "I would suggest that you not use the blend tool to create MM font data, and
    instead use the older Mask-to-Master technique. Yes, this does require that all
    your master instances have exactly the same point structure and relative placement
    (especially the start point). Yes, this does involve a few extra steps, and Yes
    this does require you to save the font metrics of your original instances in case
    they get a bit screwed up in the transition, but in my opinion it is worth it.
    By using the Mask-to-Master technique (and make sure to tell FontLab, NOT to add
    points when doing the conversion) you get to control the shapes of your glyphs
    completely. I don't know about how you work, but the last thing I want is FontLab
    mucking around with the outlines I spent so much time fine-tuning.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: yes i was told to relocate startpoints to maching positions in each masters.
    Then i repeated the blend to build MM operation, but the results were much the
    same...

    in different directions. Always a bad thing.

    the upper terminals and the spine diagonals still not look like the original shape.
    Should the diagonals be paralels in both masters? I must be doing something stupidly
    wrong!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4294.jpg]"

  body: "On a side note, with regards to the diagonals, you need to keep EITHER the
    angle the same (easiest) OR keep the ratio of the BCP distances from the on-curve
    point the same. That is, if the first BCP is twice as far from the on-curve point
    as the second one in one master, it would need to be twice as far away in the
    other master as well - even if all the distances were 50% greater or 1/3 as far
    or some other multiplier.\r\n\r\nI think James gives great advice on the rest.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
