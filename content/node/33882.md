    small. But I will keep learning. Where can I learn type design terms in Spanish?
    \r\n\r\nThis story is fascinating. Type design looks really boring compared to
    archaeology. And then throw \"history\" into the mix and it's really intriguing. "

  body: "There's an important difference between use of symbolic graphic motifs that
    vaguely resemble written characters and having a structured system of writing.
    This difference is generally ignored by people trying to find \"earliest\" writing.
    Most writing systems have artistic antecedents that go back millennia before the
    earliest evidence of a functioning system of writing, simply because the people
    who developed a system of writing were operating within a cultural tradition of
    graphic expression. And, of course, journalists almost invariably distort or miss
    the point of any archaeology story they report anyway.\r\n\r\nI probably should
    have written that in Spanish to fit in here in this thread, but I can't be bothered;
    I've got too much work to do. The jargon's pretty much the same either way."

    could try <strong>Unos tipos duros</strong>. On their site they have a <a href=\"http://www.unostiposduros.com/paginas/introtra.html\"><em>Tratado
