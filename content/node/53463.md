    exact font. I'm looking for any font with a similar look to it. Any suggestions?\r\n"

  body: "This might have been modified, but I am pretty sure that this is quite closely
    based on a font.\r\nIt looks very familiar. I hope you find out what it is soon!"

    has the same kind of ligatures.\r\nBut it looks more familiar than just that...\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "This reminds me of one of Ray Larabie's old freebies, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/dyspepsia/|Dyspepsia]],
    and it also has some similarity to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/prater-script/|Prater
    Script]]. \r\n\r\nI believe the first comment, that this is hand drawn (custom)
    is the right one about this lettering, so anything you pick would need to just
    be similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
