  20st century (or older). I prefer one that hasn't been digitalised yet. \r\nI allready
  tried a catalogue of Platin Moretus in Antwerp and found two typefaces, but these
  were allready made digital ('Cloister Black' and 'Wedding Text Std.')\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help me? \r\n\r\nThank you \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Belgian typefoundry of Jules Didot, 1914. Walloon, not Flemish, but was there
    really a distinction in style?\r\n\r\nCliquez ici pour le [[https://archive.org/details/spcimendescaract00johe|Sp\xE9cimen
    des caract\xE8res de la fonderie normale \xE0 Bruxelles, provenant de la fonderie
    de Jules Didot et de son p\xE8re, Pierre Didot]] (1914).\r\n\r\nI've actually
    been working on a digitization of this myself, mainly for an exercise of my own
    and not for any end goal. Almost complete set of decorative uppercase, missing
    some lower case examples but fairly easy to fill the gaps in the same style."
