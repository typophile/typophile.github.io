body: ' Here is a new typeface I have been working on for a while called Unicratica
  Sans. The concept is to mutate several of my favorite sans serif faces into something
  more contemporary. I was inspired years ago by Jens Gehlhaar&#39;s CIA Condendium
  &#40;his grad school thesis project&#41; Unlike Gehlhaar I am not relying so much
  on mathematics to accomplish this but more personal aesthetics and current design
  trends. Besides adding lower case &#40;which is in the works&#41; I wish to be expanded
  the face in to a unicase, multiple weights and styles. I want the majority of the
  characters to have 3 alternates like FontBoy / Bob Aufuldish&#39;s NewClear family,
  that are interchangable and aligned.   <BR>Black letters are in my opinion great
  just the way the are, the dark green letters need some work and the light green
  letters I am not so sure about yet. These need the most work of all.I could use
  some professional critique.\image '

    followed by the &#34;S&#34;. I went into a lower case pretty early on but do not
    think it works yet &#40;not posted yet&#41;. I have considered doing a kursive
    and the lowercase I have may work there if oblique/tilted. I have had a fixation
    with 3 shaped &#34;E&#34; for a while and had to try it with this face. The design
    as a whole is partly bits and pieces of client based logo types I have done for
    the past 2 years, but drawn from scratch in this incarnation. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/786.jpg"

    I was thinking during the meeting how it is kind of pathetic that I am so into

    which often kills the joy of making type. In the beginning I was working on this
    constantly for a few weeks and got stuck in the lowercase which is about 40% completed.
    I am thinking I will properly finish the unicase first as itis something I use
    a lot. Thanks for the encouragement. I will post as it progresses. Ole '

  body: ' Hi Jacques. I know what you mean and I and knew this may be an issue from
    the beginning. I set up the rules early on which included monoline, the slightly
    angular curves, flatening any curve if possible without sacrificing aesthetics,
    keeping all the usual &#34;G&#34; &#34;O&#34;,&#34;Q&#34;,&#34;S&#34;and &#34;U&#34;
    withing the parimeter of the base character height. Character width is not designed
    for a true monospaced OCR, but I wanted to make keep it going in that direction
    aesthetically, so several letters like the &#34;M&#34;&#39;s are narrower because
    of this. I tried some wide &#34;I&#34;s but I didn&#39;t like them so went more
    in the direction of small slab srifs on the &#34;I&#34;. There was consideration
    to having 2 alternates of each letter character, which i will properly still do.
    one of the could be optically adjusted, which is actually a really good idea you
    brought up. <BR>Marketing. I am not sure. I know Rod at PsyOps and would be proud
    to be distributed by him. He is very ethical and trustworthy as well as talented
    in the design and distribution of type. <BR>I am currently working on some promotional
    collateral for Psy/Ops&#39;s latest release &#34;Reform&#34;. Emigre would properly
    be the most prestigious distributor but they are really hard to get distributed
    by, according to people I know who have approached them with good designs. Lineto
