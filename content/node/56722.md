  a symbol for the Indian Rupee:\r\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&id=c8097698-a806-4cc2-8c67-668d594057dc&Headline=India+seeks+global+symbol+for+rupee\r\n\r\nand
  http://www.labnol.org/india/currency-symbol-for-indian-rupee/7739/\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  just the rupee is written, just as \"Rs\". They'd like it to be a symbol that is
  enterable from a standard keyboard like the \"$\" since the rules mention,  symbol
  should be applicable to the standard computer keyboard.\"\r\n\r\nIn which case,
  I was wondering then:\r\n\r\na. Does that mean one can't create a special \"logo\"
  for it?\r\n\r\nb. Doesn't that leave one with only the standard glyphs\r\n   that
  are common to most typefaces on a standard keyboard?\r\n\r\nAre there any other
  options?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

    written poorly as the symbol will need to be adopted by Unicode and added to new
    keyboard layouts.\r\naddedum: No. Standards, licensing, etc."

    you mean that due to licensing issues\r\none can't create a glyph for arial etc?\r\n\r\nIn
    any case if we can create our own design, why would we want to do this. \r\nThanks
    for your explanation. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nIshan"
