    alt="snell"> <BR> <BR>It also appears to be slightly spaced out so the connecting
    strokes aren&#39;t connecting, and some of the counters appear to be filled in.
    The sample is pretty small and low-res so it&#39;s difficult to tell for sure
    what&#39;s going on with the counters.'

  body: You know, if I&#39;m not mistaken, this may be one of those &#34;original&#34;
    fonts that Dinc Type did. The site appears to be down or possibly gone forever.
    A lot of their fonts were existing fonts with various transformations done to
    them &#40;as has been done to Snell here&#41; to make them look &#34;original.&#34;
