  Looking at it now, I'm think the Hebrew might be a little too condensed, or at the
  very least my spacing is too tight. (Which is at least part of it.) Some of the
  thins also might be too thin also. I'll have to work on that. Anything else appreciated!"

    type design. I agree that the Hebrew is\r\ntoo tight. But I'm happy to see you're
    paying attention\r\nto the relationship between the two scripts in terms of\r\nvertical
    proportions. However the Latin caps are too tall\r\ncompared to the ascenders;
    and the ascenders are too short\r\ncompared to the descenders. So I would make
    the ascenders\r\nat least as tall as the caps. Also, again as you suspect, the\r\nHebrew
    has more contrast than the Latin; I would try to\r\nmake the thins less thin.
    Lastly, the \"w\" is too narrow.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    been my hardest glyph, overall. I've been having trouble with it the entire time.
    I went through several phases of my Hebrew design, and haven't ever been happy
    with.\r\n\r\nHrant: Thanks! :-)"

    I think that the main issue is the proportion (and the optical iIllusion); e.g.
    the kof vs. lamed ; the he vs. dalet -- the dalet looks too wide.\r\n\r\n2. The
    yod, or the lower part is too short! see for example the work by Zvi Narkis --
    Narkisim.\r\n\r\n3. The shin is not just too small/condensed -- as Bill said --
    \ but also too symmetrical; moreover, compare your shin, ayin, tzadi to Hadasa.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Brian,\r\n  Your Hebrew looks good alongside Neuton. However the Latin
    font is so much more dominating. This is a problem with most Hebrew fonts - those
    Romans were very much into domination!\r\nWhat's to do? Maybe the serifs on the
    Hebrew could have fewer curves. Look how cleanly 'chiseled' are the upper serifs
    in Neuton. The serifs in the Hebrew look as if they were done with a brush or
    quill but the Neuton serifs were hammered into stone.\r\n\r\nYou might study the
    shin in other fonts. Nueton is a STRONG font with no nonsense and you need a strong
    shin to go with it. If it's going to lean, it should lean like someone striding
    (from right to left) with a heavy backpack.\r\n\r\nThe vertical of the bet has
    bend and might be better straight.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"
