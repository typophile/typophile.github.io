body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am working on a logo type for a new product company that could
  use some feedback. It is partnered with a mark that I am not including since the
  type should stand on its own as well. The idea is to partner soft curves with hard
  functional lines and have both interesting positive and negative space.\r\n\r\nSince
  I tweaked and made some of the individual letters, I want to be certain that things
  feel balanced and not like a random collection of different fonts. Kerning issues
  and the like are still being resolved too. Other suggestions for sprucing/sexing
  it up or whatever are also appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nAnjel\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/waterbox_5413.png]\r\n<br><br><br>"

  body: "Even though you want the logotype to stand on its own, the letterforms must
    still be sympathetic to the symbol. So, it's hard to judge it true effectiveness
    without seeing it as a whole.\r\n\r\nRegarding the letters themselves: the crossbar
    on the A seems too high and the X is too wide.  The left and right half of the
    X should overlap, not just barely meet.  I think the W might be a touch too wide
    as well."

  body: "I like the W but maybe squeeze it in a tad. I'd go with a more traditional
    A like in Zevbiz's example and tighten up the X so that it reads better. Another
    idea for the X would be to turn a + symbol if you're going for a handmade character
    appeal.\r\n\r\nYou might also try adding a thin stroked box around the type to
    further iterate the 'box' theme. \r\n\r\nSee below.\r\n\r\nI do rather fancy the
    boxy look and the subtle gray color though. Nice start.\r\n\r\nThe font in these
    is Gotham HTF Medium weight and I rotated the + symbol 45\xB0.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/waterbox_3968.jpg]"

  body: "I like the softness of your letterforms. But I guess you're gonan have to
    change \"W\". Maybe get some roundness to the X as well. Don't know how (it at
    all possible) but it could be nice since it ends the word.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

  body: "I don't see a problem in the use of the rounded A and the rounded W but still
    have the other problems on my point of view. X is too wide and maybe it is a bit...
    concise with the rest of the logo (compare it with the o). T is too wide, it should
    be less than the A wide.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // yrmk\r\nsound & visual"
