body: "This one might be impossible, but this board is pretty good with responses.\r\n\r\nLooks
  similar to when the title \"Superman\" appears on screen, with a bit of a 3-d block
  style to it.  The element I doubt I can replicate the most would be the glow surrounding
  the letters.  The old logo for cable channel Showtime\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/showtime_4390.JPG]"

  body: I think that is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/franklin-gothic/|Franklin
    Gothic]]. Either Demi Italic or Heavy Italic. The glow effect is easy in either
    Photoshop or Illustrator. Do a search for something like "glowing letters tutorial
    neon" and the name of the software you use.
