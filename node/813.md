  <BR> <BR>This is Seriatim Gestalt, an experimental typeface inspired by and similar
  to Jonathan Hoefler&#39;s HTF Gestalt. I wanted to see if I could add a workable
  lower case, and try my hand at my own version of the upper case and symbols in a
  style that would make for a reductivist addition to my Seriatim family &#40;now
  showing in the Sans Serif Critique Forum&#41;. <BR> <BR>The question behind the
  experiment is this: How much of each character can be removed while still allowing
  the human mind&#39;s phenomenon of &#34;gestalt recognition&#34; &#40;recognizing
  the whole&#41; to still resolve each individual character? <BR> <BR>The result seems
  to be very similar to a stencil font, but then it occurred to me that stencil fonts
  are another extension of this same question. In order to allow counters, etc., to
  remain in place in a stencil font, what parts of each character can be safely removed
  without compromising character recognition? Seriatim Gestalt simply takes it beyond
  the counters. <BR> <BR>As always, comments are appreciated and encouraged. <BR>

    issue, where even the questions &#40;much less the answers&#41; have yet to be
    properly formulated. <BR> <BR>Seriatim Gestalt: Some of your &#34;solutions&#34;,
    like the lc &#34;a&#34;, are really nice! <BR> <BR>Next step: Get yourself an
    audience, and do some real-world &#40;although fundamentally informal&#41; tests.

  body: I love this concept -- I&#39;m a big fan of J Hoefler&#39;s variant. you&#39;re
    goal, to include the lc is a truely valient one. you&#39;ve done a wonderfully
    modest job on the ligatures! also, the uc M is really standing out to my eye here,
    the diagonals assist in completing the shape quite well.  <BR> <BR>my overall
    impression is that you still have some research ahead of you. I&#39;m not certain
    the components you are emphasizing are the essential ones &#40;I&#39;m thinking
    of the lc k &amp; a at the moment&#41;. some of the characters seem less reductivist
    than decoratively geometric &#40;the lc p &amp; d, perhaps&#41;

    <BR> <BR>Which leads directly to a central conundrum: <BR>A font consisting of
    &#34;gestalt-minimal&#34; shapes isn&#39;t necessarily something anybody would
    actually want to use... Which doesn&#39;t make it a bad effort, not at all. But
    a &#42;usable&#42; font &#40;as opposed to a truly experimental one, in the scientific/analytical
    sense&#41; has to strike a compromise between theory and aesthetics. <BR> <BR>I
    can&#39;t read David&#39;s mind &#40;for which I should probably be thankful ;-&#41;
    but I wonder if he&#39;s worried about where this treacherous road leads, or if
    he&#39;s just enjoying the strange scenery &#40;and there&#39;s nothing wrong
    with that, quite the contrary&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR>Actually, you&#39;ve hit on something, though, Hrant -- this has been one
    of the more strange &#40;yet fun&#41; typographic forays I&#39;ve taken. <BR>
    <BR>The lower-case &#34;a&#34; was a startling accident, as I played with forming
    an &#34;a&#34; out of a reversed &#34;s&#34;. What you see above is what resulted.
    The upper-case &#34;M&#34; had a similar genesis, as I tinkered with the angles
    and strokes of the glyph. <BR> <BR>PlainClothes: <BR>I agree that this experiemnt
    is far from complete. I&#39;ll probably go ahead and release this typeface soon,
    after a few adjustments, but I&#39;ll continue the experimentation toward perhaps
    creating an even more reductivist version sometime in the future. <BR> <BR>David '

    <BR> <BR>Which reminds me of an experiment I&#39;ve been considering: making a
    font &#40;probably out of Times&#41; that substitutes other letters for the real
    ones, with some minimal manipulation. Like taking an &#34;e&#34;, rotating it
    180, and adding a small curling stroke to the bottom-right: one messed-up &#34;a&#34;!
    <BR> <BR>The main point would be to illustrate first-hand the difference between
    legibility &#40;which would be totally devastated&#41; versus readability &#40;which
    would be affected much less, as long as the silhouette of each character is mostly
    maintained&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '
