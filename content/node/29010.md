  except the middle arm of the E does not have the same serif/beak as the version
  with which I'm familiar. Is there some alternate/knockoff version of Friz Quadrata
  that has the E shown below, or must it have been tweaked for the logo?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/E_4093.jpg]"

  body: "It seems just to simply have had the lower part of the middle arm lopped
    off at an angle. This would be a very simple modification in Illustrator, for
    example, by subtracting the path of a triangular shape from the outline for the
    letter.\r\nIs this the whole logo to which you were referring?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
