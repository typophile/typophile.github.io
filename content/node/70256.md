    I really like some of his free fonts. Fontin is screwed up however, and he won't

  body: "<cite>\"If it was a car, Titillium would be recalled.\"</cite>\r\nSorry but
    this really is one of the more inane font-to-physical-world comparisons I've heard
    lately. Malfunctioning cars freakin kill people. That's why they eventually, sometimes,
    get recalled. Not because of some sort of inherent morals, or professionalism,
    or whatever of the automotive industry that the font world lacks. Besides, I really
    haven't seen too many cars that were available for free.\r\n\r\nI personally wouldn't
    use Titillium, but as with most free fonts, you simply get what you pay for. Complaining
    seems pretty pointless to me."

  body: "<em>As with most free fonts, you simply get what you pay for. Complaining
    seems pretty pointless to me.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Au contraire.</strong> Sometimes
    with free fonts you get more than you pay for, and sometimes with paid-for fonts
    you get less than you paid for. I don't care if it's a paid-for or a free font.
    If it does not work is should be fixed or removed. Of the more than half-dozen
    paid-for fonts that would not work as downloaded, generally the vendor corrected
    the problem; some slowly, some begrudgingly, and some gladly. At least one I had
    to fix myself.\r\n\r\nI recently downloaded the free font <strong>[[http://www.woodardworks.com/type27.html|Veggieburger]]</strong>
    and had a problem with it. The designer acknowledged the problem and said he was
    unaware of it; within hours, he fixed it and emailed me the corrected font. Better
    service than I've ever gotten from a designer or vendor for a paid font with a
    problem. A class act.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote to Jos Buivenga about Fontin, he was
    kind enough to reply, and he agreed with me, but said he didn't have the time
    to fix it. Fair enough.\r\n\r\nLet me try to be clear about my position. I'm not
    \"negative\" on free fonts. I'm not \"negative\" on paid-for fonts. I love fonts
    that work. I hate fonts that don't work. I love people that accept responsibility
    for their work. Do I expect tons of \"free\" service from makers of free fonts?
    No! Do I expect type designers who charge for their fonts to give me a font that
    works out of the box? Absolutely! Does that always happen? Absolutely not.\r\n\r\nI'm
    getting sick and tired of type designers and typophiles who piss and moan about
    people who want free fonts, and then, usually in the same breath, defend type
    designers who charge for their fonts when they don't work by saying \"Sh*t happens.\"
    If I'm paying good money for what I expect to be good fonts, sh*t shouldn't happen.
    That should be the difference between professionals and amateurs. The high and
    mighty who think they can charge for fonts and deliver fonts that don't work should
    get off their high horse. Some free font designers put you to shame.\r\n\r\n"

    your awful car analogy, if someone gives you a car for free, are you going to
    make him or her pay for the service when something goes wrong? I agree that if
    you buy a font with a commercial license that does not allow modification, then
    it should work out of the box. I also agree that this does not always happen,
    and I agree that type designers, if they want to maintain reputations as producers
    of quality work, should be obliged to fix whatever problems there are. Most do
    fix these problems when asked. However, you should not expect the same out of
    the designer of a free font with a license that allows modification.\r\n\r\nThis
    is how the free market works. What does this person who gave you their fonts for
    free stand to gain from fixing a bug, or lose from not fixing it?"

    One foundry also had the naming set the \u201CTitillium\u201D way, so in Word
    only the Black Italic was functioning. It took a lot of time and effort to get
    good fonts, since they first claimed the fonts were okay in Adobe CS.\r\n\r\nThe
    other foundry delivered fonts that didn\u2019t work well with Universal Type Server.
    They knew about this problem, but blamed UTS. The designers wanted to use the
    font, but couldn't. The EULA states no modification etc. etc. etc, and the foundry
    claims that the fonts are 100% okay. \r\nSo my moral question would be; to fix
