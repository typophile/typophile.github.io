<p>The Typing Stickers on this internet site are to alter the k/K shape letters to क/क lower and upper case shaped letters on keyboards and other things for spiritual philosophy reasons.  There are reasons for this that have been mentioned on the internet, for example over on this internet site: <a href="http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com">http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com</a> (old google-sites address) or <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/Kalphabet">http://sites.google.com/site/Kalphabet</a> (new google-sites address).</p>
<p>The downloads on this internet site are typing sticकer templates that could be used to print and then sticक on कeyboards and other things that have k/K shape, for example, fax machines, mobile or cell phones, PDA and even old fashioned typewriters etc.</p>
<p>The typing sticकer templates here available from this internet site were used for printing by using an online printing service called &lsquo;Moo&rsquo; or &lsquo;Moo.com,&rsquo; <a href="http://www.moo.com">http://www.moo.com</a> and the typing sticकers printed were relatively cheap under GB Pounds £7 (in yr. 2012) compared to buying custom printed कeyboard sticकers or buying a Cherry MX कeyboard with custom कeycaps.  Moo.com has Sticकers x 90 product (in yr. 2012)  see <a href="http://uk.moo.com/products/stickerbooks.html">http://uk.moo.com/products/stickerbooks.html</a> and the description for them is, for example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your artworक or photography to create 90 postage stamp-sized sticकers, bound into a pocकet-size booक. Perforated along one side, each sticकer sheet is easy to tear out and share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MOO Sticकers are printed on thicक, high quality vinyl. Photos and artworक print equally well, and the glossy finish maकes the colours &lsquo;pop&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Printfinity&rsquo; gives you the option of printing a different design on every single Sticकer in the booक. Choose a range of different photos or designs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please note that User would have to cut these to size with a scissor.</p>
<p>Downloadable from here are alter k/K shape letter sticकer templates so that other Users too could benefit from customizing their PC, laptop or netbooक कeyboards and also other things cheaply by downloading from here.</p>
<p>There are sticकers for the offending K shape letter कeycap seen on कeyboards. 
Sticकers for other कeycaps that have the offending k/K shape  in within different words, for example, &ldquo;Caps Lock&rdquo; have been catered for. 
Italic and both white and blacक कeyboard colors have also been catered for.
Also laptop and netbooक sizes were seen and hopefully have been catered for.<br>
Devices were seen that a person might have where there be devices displaying the k/K shaped letter inside words and thus different sizes have been catered for.
Both double-decकer and single-decकer options for certain कeycaps have been catered for.</p>
<p>Scissors to trim the sticकers would be required.</p>
<p>The fonts used for the typing sticकer templates are BBT font and Rail Model font.  There are 4 templates that could be downloaded by Users from here and then they could all be uploaded to Moo.com in one go:</p>
