body: "i'm after a certain kind of brasilian text face, and i was after some recommendations.
  i've checked out the very useful wiki http://typophile.com/wiki/brazil and some
  of the sites listed on it. there's also http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/brasilfonts.html
  and http://www.typophile.com/node/13220 \r\n\r\nbut this post relates to something
  a little more specific and i was hoping you guys could help me out. here are the
  details:\r\n\r\n--i'm after a brasilian-designed, or failing that s. american face.\r\n\r\n--it's
  for text i'm setting on the brasilian diva elis regina (not for publication--i am
  setting the text just as a learning excersise). so it could somehow reflect some
  of the character of brasilian music, or better still, of the fiery singer, known
  as 'little pepper'.\r\n\r\n--specifically, i would like something taut and beziery,
  with M-formula-type curves; perhaps part of that certain recent trend of south american
  faces some have termed 'fauve'. http://typophile.com/node/5303\r\n\r\n--must be
  suitable for setting extended text, must have OS figs, pref SC also. OTF preferably.
  an extensive range of weights wd be nice, but is rather less important.\r\n\r\n--budget
  is also a consideration, as this is just a personal project, and i've spent all
  my money on brasilian music:)\r\n\r\nmiguel, is your quetzal available? that fits
  the bill totally!\r\n\r\nany suggestions welcome\r\n\r\ng\r\n\r\nps. congrats guys,
  by the way, on last night's victory:)"
