  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">In the mid 1970s, I partnered with a couple of other graphic designers to form a type house. We did work on AM International equipment with a type library of about 400 faces. By the mid 1980s, it was pretty clear we were losing our hold on technology and we bailed. I bought a CP/M computer and typed my manuscripts in WordStar with coding entered in parentheses. There was no way to tell if I had coded it correctly until I traveled down to a printing house that gladly accepted work such as mine, and then saw the final output on photo paper. It was a pretty ragged workflow but I did it until 1987 when I got my first mac and QuarkXPress.
My first digital fonts were in the form of screen fonts (no printer fonts). I would compose a job and then take the QXP file to a shop that had all of the printer fonts for my screen fonts. Still a bit ragged as a workflow, but better than the WordStar routine. Over the next ten years or so, I acquired lots of PostScript Type 1 and Type 3 typefaces. Most were purchased in collections such as the Adobe Wild Type collection.
During the 1990s I purchased a copy of Typographer from Altsys. I used it only to modify my existing type fonts. For example, I added some special characters to my Palatino font to use in doing jobs for one of my clients.
A couple of weeks ago I started building an archive of my old typeface library (much of which is stored on old 400k floppies). Once all of them are in one place, I&rsquo;d like to begin a workflow which will start with trying to piece as many of them as possible into a collection of Type 1 fonts. Then, I&rsquo;d like to move on and move them into Open Type format.
I&rsquo;m wondering if, for the first step, my old copy of Fontographer will do. And, then for the next step of taking them to Open Type, do I buy a conversion utility, or do I need to bite the bullet and get a full-featured program like Font Lab?  Advice would be appreciated.</div>
