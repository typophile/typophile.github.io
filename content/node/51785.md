  body: "Wow! Really close!\r\n\r\nBut OCR-F isn't a real monospaced font (I have
    the Regular and the Light versions), and the capital \"M\" and capital \"C\" aren't
    exactly the same...\r\n\r\nARGN! Thanks, tough!  "

  body: Do you have a PDF of your sample? If the font is embedded there, you can look
    its name up.

  body: "looks a lot like 'Rhodesia' by Norm  with Aur\xE8le Sack and Maxime Buechi\r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/The+Designers/Norm/\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if I'm not mistaken, the book <a href=\"http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&id_t=&id_p=15&id_b=855&search=Replay&page=1&total=1\"><i>Replay
    Marclay</i> </a>was designed by Norm \r\n\r\nThere was a page on  <a href=\"http://www.maximebuechi.com\">
    Maxime Buechi's site</a> that had more information about the typeface, but that
    appears to be gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nBut I can't see \"Rhodesia\" anywhere on the Lineto site,
    and on the Norm site... And if \"Rhodesia\" is the font displayed on Norm's greeting
    page, it's true... It's pretty similar... But the capital \"I\" aren't the same,
    and the font isn't monospaced...\r\n\r\nI guess it's an unreleased exclusive font!"
