body: "Hi,\r\nSaw the posting on American type (http://typophile.com/node/12634),
  which reminded me of a research on swedish typography I was working on a while ago.
  Since I don't know of any swedish typography forums, but am sure there are lots
  of swedes hanging out here and others with opinions on the subject, I thought I
  should give my research a new try here with this posting.\r\n\r\nBeeing Swede (hej!),
  I feel kind of rootless when it comes to typography. We don't have a great history
  of punch-cutting (something I read was because of our our country beeing so small
  and the equipment was to expensive...) nor very many new, digital typefaces by Swedes.
  But still, there must be such a thing as swedish typography?\r\nLiving in Amsterdam,
  I asked my teachers and friends -- not beeing Swedes --  what their opinion on swedish
  typography is. Most of them didn't have a very strong opinion, and they are people
  with a great knowledge on the matter, so I take it as swedish typography isn't very
  \"famous\" or known.\r\nThere are of course typefaces by swedes - from Berling by
  Karl-Erik Forsberg (http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1157.html), the most
  known one, to newer fonts such as Kada (lineto.com), Peter Bruhns typefaces (fountain.nu)
  and such.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I am not really sure what I am looking for. Is it
  typefaces designed by swedes, used by swedes or maybe inspired by swedes/sweden?
  If i design a typeface based on something I found in Germany, is my typeface swedish
  (as me), german (as the original) or dutch (where I live and study under great influence
  of dutch typographers)? \r\nI guess I am looking for everything; typefaces, contexts
  etc.\r\n\r\nSomehow I would consider Berling a \"true\" swedish font -- it is the
  only one I know of that actually has been designed for the swedish language; how
  we combine the letters in the swedish language and so on. But is that then the definition
  of a typefaces history? Did Frutiger design Univers for the french/german (sorry,
  I don't know what part of Switzerland he was from) language, or did he design it
  for all latin languages; does that have anything to do with anything?\r\n\r\nI don't
  know if anyone has an opinion on this but I thought I'd give it a try.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nPeter

  body: "What a great topic!\r\n\r\nI think that Sweden is actually a hot-bed of typography.
    First, you have [[Fountain]] in Malm\xF6 (http://www.fountain.nu/), run by [[Peter
    Bruhn]].\r\n\r\nThen there is MacRhino (http://www.macrhino.com/), whose homepage
    bills itslef as \"a new Swedish foundry\". [[Stefan Hattenbach]] is a regular
    here on Typophile. I think that [[Stephen Coles]] used to work for him in Sweden.
    Coles could be considered an honorary Swede, at the very least.\r\n\r\nLook at
    Linotype's Library (in Germany) over the past few years. Since I began working
    there, I've begun to think more and more that we are turning into a bastion for
    Swedish type designers\u2026 in our library, there is work from:\r\n\r\nAnders
    Bodebeck (http://www.linotype.com/7-2286-7/andersbodebeck.html)\r\nBo Berndal
    (http://www.linotype.com/7-1936-7/boberndal.html)\r\nFranko Luin (not born a Swede,
    but been there long enough! http://www.linotype.com/7-1527-7/frankoluin.html)\r\nLutz
    Baar (http://www.linotype.com/7-1945-7/lutzbaar.html)\r\nand Lars Berquist (http://www.linotype.com/7-1925-7/larsberquist.html)\r\n(maybe
    more, sorry if I left anyone out).\r\n\r\nPlus, in Stockholm, you've got Pangea
    Design (http://www.pangeadesign.se/) which looks like Sweden's coolest design
    studio (at least from their website). Frederick from up there is an active poster
    here.\r\n\r\nThere are other typographic studios, too, i.e., A4 (http://www.a4.se/)\r\n\r\nLastly,
    a month ago, I saw the most fantastically illustrated book on the history of typography\u2026
    and it was in Swedish (my girlfriend can speak some of the langauge\u2026 I think
    I had her translate half of it aloud for me just so that I could understand some
    of it!). I don't have a link to it, but it was new\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>The thing
    is, I am not really sure what I am looking for. Is it typefaces designed by swedes,
    used by swedes or maybe inspired by swedes/sweden? If i design a typeface based
    on something I found in Germany, is my typeface swedish (as me), german (as the
    original) or dutch (where I live and study under great influence of dutch typographers)?</em>\r\n\r\nI
    think that your typeface would be Swedish AND German\u2026 and maybe Dutch, too.
    That is the great thing about moving around.\r\n\r\nJust because some experts
    you asked in the Netherlands did not know much about Swedish typography doesn't
    mean that Swedish design isn't good or well-known. I'm an American living in Germany,
    and I haven't even spent three days in Sweden. But the quality of the work up
    there has managed to filter down to me anyway.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    I don't believe in a specific Swedish typographic idiom. A typeface is Swedish
    if the designer is Swedish. Other will argue the opposite, and whenever I go to
    Denmark I can almost see their point. Now </strong>there's <strong>a typographic
    tradition You'll notice as specifically Danish. Although I wouldn't go so far
    to say You'll read Danish more efficiently in their wide sturdy type. Looks nice
    though.\r\nThe Swedish typographic scene has its heroes, but there hasn't been
    any real continuity, and, as elsewhere, no status in the craft. However, I wouldn't
    exclude the possibility that in the not too distant future there could actually
    be something happening in a more organized way. As Dan points out, things they
    are a-cookin'.\r\n\r\nRegarding Karl-Erik Forsberg and Berling: We recently redesigned
    and updated it as </strong><a href=\"http://www.berlingnova.se/\">Berling Nova</a>
    <strong> and we're currently exploring possibilities for additional weights etc.</strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192"

    name, <strong>Univers</strong>, says it all: that typeface was multilingual by
    design. Emil Ruder, the champion of the International Style, has a special section
    on Univers in his <em>Typographie</em> (1967). There he shows its being used to
    typeset various languages, and compares it with other typefaces he thinks worked
    better for certain languages, and worse for others. If memory serves, those were:
    Garamond, for French; Baskerville, for English; and Bodoni, for Italian. That
    sort of thing..."

  body: "Hi there Peter,\r\n\r\nI think the Swedish typographic scene is more alive
    and kicking than ever. I do have a great respect for older designers like Karl-Erik
    Forsberg, Kumlin, Bo Berndahl etc, but the younger generations are coming on strong.
    I am probably somewhere in between (43, but hey I feel like 25) and plan to make
    a hell of a lot more typefaces than the the bunch I've made so far. I have the
    greatest respect for older techniques and the skill and knowledge that had to
    be included in order to perform well. But on the other hand I thank my lucky star
    that I live here and now, and are able to produce so much more than a couple of
    hundred years back... Fountain, Pangea and some others are also very active and
    I find it very stimulating to be part of all this. Peter, please welcome to join
    the party - long live Swedish typography! \r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Hej everyone,\r\nThanks for the shown interest and great answers! \r\nI guess
    I was beeing a bit unclear of how I see swedish typography \u2013 it's not that
    I don't think there are great things going on right now, I do for sure; I think
    what a lot of the people mentioned above do is amazing, and Farsan (oh, thats
    Peter Bruhn to you) has been my typographic guide in life since as long as I can
    remember, his stuff is of course awesome.\r\nI guess, it's more about if these
    typefaces are swedish or just made by swedes.. if that is something that can be
    decided these days, or if that's just totally uninteresting? I guess I have compared
    the situation with things such as what was going on in Switzerland in the 50s-60s
    and the heritige coming from that (with things as the fonts at lineto.com, that
    in my opinion is very swiss somehow). But I am thinking more and more that in
    the days of modern living, with internet and all, maybe a thing as swedish typography
    is totally uninteresting; we pick our ways of seeing things, influences and so
    on from here and there, and don't follow in the traditional footsteps of other
    swedes (in this case). As said in my first posting, I don't really see my typographic
    interest coming from anything swedish, it has more been based on books & internet
    (from everywhere) in the past and dutch typography since I moved to Amsterdam.\r\nWell,
    have to go to school now... \r\n\r\nGr\xFCsse,\r\npeter\r\n\r\n"
