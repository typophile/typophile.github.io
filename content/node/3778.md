    <BR>The folks who bought the Berthold library made an excellent business decision.
    I just think their practices since then don&#39;t make great business sense. Maybe

    Does MS really think that MikeRowe and his site are going to cause confusion?

    if Berthold sent Nick Curtis a cease and desist letter and he responded no or

    <BR>In the US, my understanding is that only the name can be trademarked, and

  body: 'Nigel, you wrote that Linotype no longer delivers the Akzidenz Grotesk. That&#39;s
    right. But nowadays Linotype delivers 4 weights and 4 italics of the Basic Commercial
    typeface. If you look at <a href="http://www.linotype.com" target="_blank">www.linotype.com</a>
    you will be able to read the following sentence: &#34;Basic Commercial font is
    based on the design for Akzidenz Grotesk, which appeared with Berthold in 1900,
    designed by type setters whose names have not been recorded, but whose skill cannot
    be overlooked. This typeface has been popular among groups and movements so diverse
    as the Bauhaus, Dadaism, and the masters of Swiss typography. It served as an
    influence for a variety of newer, more anonymous grotesque fonts as well as Helvetica.
    Basic Commerical font is a clear and objective font whose forms exhibit almost
    nothing unusual, but which remains both lively and legible&#34;.  <BR>Basic Commercial
    is available in OpenType with the better hinting, But also in PS and TT for non-InDesign

  body: jumping in late here with a few points <BR> <BR>Prior Art, while mostly cited
    in patent and copyright cases, <BR>can also apply to trademarks. <BR> <BR>You
    can file a trademark as <BR> <BR>a&#41; the word <BR>b&#41; the design alone <BR>c&#41;
    word &#43; design <BR> <BR>the patent examiner will check active trademarks <BR>for
    possible conflicts, thus checking for Prior Art. <BR> <BR>In the Berthold/Delta
    situation specifically, Prior Art, taken literally, is <BR>indeed irrelevant but
    Prior Use is not. <BR> <BR>William wrote &#34;my understanding is that the owner
    of a trademark <BR>is required to sue or risk losing ownership of the trademark.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Not quite right. It will help you if you can <BR>show a track record
    of protecting your mark. <BR>But there is not requirement to sue. <BR>It&#39;s
    not about that. <BR>But if you have a trademark that is in jeopardy, <BR>nowadays,
    you probably are spending your money elsewhere. <BR>On advertising. <BR>That&#39;s
    how you keep from &#39;losing&#39; a mark from <BR>it becoming genericized. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>Take Xerox, Wite-Out, Band-Aid, Velcro and some <BR>others. The owners
    of these marks take out ads every month in various magazines <BR>&#40;usually
    Writer-oriented publications&#41; that spell <BR>out proper usage of their marks
    in print. <BR> <BR>Kleenex &#40;TM&#41; brand disposable tissues, etc.  <BR> <BR>the
    older brands did not do that ... if I&#39;m not mistaken.  <BR>So these brands
    today can point to a pile of money <BR>spent educating others on proper usage
    <BR>if the generic nature of their mark becomes an issue. <BR> <BR>As far as Berthold,
    it&#39;s interesting to look specifically at the Delta mark&#39;s history. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>You can send out letters and threaten but <BR>you can&#39;t file a suit
    until you have a <BR>registered mark in hand. That&#39;s my understanding. <BR>
    <BR>Which means nothing here anyway as long as Berthold <BR>isn&#39;t missrepresenting
    its marks.... big company vs. an <BR>individual, some threatening letters,  <BR>ends
    things pretty quickly without litigation. <BR> <BR>but if Berthold had wanted
    to sue Jamie, it would have had to wait until <BR>&#39;Delta&#39; became registered
    <BR>or sue for infringement on the &#39;Delta Jaeger&#39; <BR>mark only, not the
    &#39;Delta&#39; mark. <BR> <BR>blah, blah, of course this is boring. <BR>More

    wait until  &#39;Delta&#39; became registered <BR> <BR>You are wrong on this.
    You can sue without a trademark being registered. <BR> <BR>&#62;More interesting
    ... luc&#39;s summary, below <BR> <BR>Luc&#39;s article is full of incorrect statements
    and conclusions it belongs in the Star or National Enquirer.  <BR> <BR>He also
    references comments by Fred Nader which speaks for itself. <BR> <BR>As far as
    how I feel that Berthold is being run I think that the type industry is going
    back to the days when foundries exclusively distribute their own product. <BR>
    <BR>For example only Linotype markets Linotype Univers, Optima Nova, Linotype
    Syntax etc. <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t see any of Agfa Monotype&#39;s new product
    &#40;including ITC&#41; in the Adobe Library or through Linotype. <BR> <BR>In
    fact in a recent Adobe&#39;s SEC filing there is a lawsuit between Agfa Monotype
    and Adobe which Adobe claims would have an adverse effect if they lost. <BR> <BR>Berthold
    controls its product although it apears that Agfa Monotype distributes Berthold
    rather than licensing it as they did in the past. <BR> <BR>I think Agfa Monotype,
    Berthold, and Linotype are doing things the right way. Controlling their product.
    <BR> <BR>And the only reason that I entered this thread is that I keep seeing
    so much misinformation about trademarks that no wonder the independent type designer
    gets into trouble if he doesn&#39;t know right from wrong. Especially if he follows
    Luc&#39;s positions. <BR> <BR>Nigel Hamilton

    so I assumed that trademarks would be the same. hmmm. <BR>  <BR>&#62; You can
    sue without a trademark being registered.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Of course anyone can
    sue anyone over anything. <BR>But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you are saying.
    <BR>You&#39;re saying that a judge would actually hear a TM case <BR>&#40;and
    not throw it out&#41; where the plaintiff only has a common <BR>law trademark
    but not a pending or registered mark. <BR> <BR>yeah? <BR> <BR>I would like to

  body: BJ <BR> <BR>Yes you can file suit without a trademark being registered however
    the burden of proof is on the person suing. <BR> <BR>If a trademark is registered
    then there is the presumption that the trademark is valid and the burden shifts
    to the defendant. Additionally if the infringement is intentional the plaintiff
    may be awarded attorneys fees and treble damages. <BR> <BR>You can find more information

    to me quite reasonable. Sari is in fact a &#39;new Baremo&#39;and &#39;New Barem&#39;
    would be exploiting the reputation of the old which is still evidently owned by

    to consider is that in general typeface designs are not protected so the only

    the typeface &#40;Omicron Delta&#41; Omicron Univers, Omicron Rockwell he probably

    way. Controlling their product&#60; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve kept quiet for a long time,
    but now i have to clear up a few facts. <BR> <BR>1. Berthold Types in chicago
    is not the legal successor to H. Berthold AG <BR> <BR>2. Berthold Types has registered
    most of H. Berthold&#39;s trademarks and thus has every right to defend them <BR>
    <BR>3. Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original designers whose
    fonts are being sold today; thus effectively stealing from designers like Hans
    Reichel, who designed Barmeno but doesn&#39;t receive license payments for his
    design. Nor was he allowed to re-issue his own face as New Barmeno. So he had
    to call it Sari and redraw it extensively, just to be able to publish a typeface
    he licensed to H. Berthold AG, not Berthold Types &#40;see 1&#41;.  <BR> <BR>4.
    Berthold Types sues everybody who only gets into the vicinity of one of their
    trademarks or even imagined marks, for example &#34;super&#34; or even &#34;grotesk&#34;.
    In these cases they just lost, finally. It is absurd to want to claim a trademark
    for a generic term like Grotesk, just because it occurs in one of their trademarks
    &#40;Akzidenz Grotesk&#41;. Defending this not only cost countless hours but also
    tens of thousands of dollars in attorneys&#39; fees. <BR> <BR>5. They have been
    sueing dozens of people with frivolous cases. Failing to answer brings about a
    judgement in their favour; answering cost more money than all these small designers
    and foundries have. They win not by being right, but by default. <BR> <BR>6. They
    are bullies; it is not about trademarks but about deleting the competition. <BR>
    <BR>7. I could cite many more &#40;and worse&#41; cases which have cost me and
    other designers and foundries millions of dollars &#40;and i am not exaggerating&#41;,
    but this will probably already make me the target of the next attack. <BR> <BR>8.
    This list doesn&#39;t discuss legal matters for their own sake. This list is not
    called legaphile; it is run by and for people who care for and live by typography.'
