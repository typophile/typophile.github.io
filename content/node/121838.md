  Sans (a book and a website) and now I'm doubtful about which font to be used in
  the booklet describing the design process. The booklet is not part of the designed
  system, but it should be coherent with the rest since they are going to be presented
  together.\r\nDo you suggest that I should use the same fonts or not? If not, do
  you have any recommendation for a coherent serif typeface?\r\n\r\nThank you very
  much in advance."

    sure I understand. If they are related projects then using the same font families
    for both (and same graphic style) would help.\r\n\r\nIf they are unrelated projects
    then normally the fonts don't need to match. Unless you view them as \"related\"
    since they are part of the same presentation in which case a similar style for
    everything might make sense."
