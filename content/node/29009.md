    making such pairings. '

  body: I think you'd be better off using Requiem with Whitney because they're by
    the same designer. Those Requiem ligatures are such a cool concept but I wish
    there were more of them, like 'gg' or 'ir' would be tops.

  body: "The only problem with the \"same designer\" logic is that it's only a starting
    point. When you actually compare Whitney and Kievit, you see that Whitney is much
    coarser, with Grotesque features that aren't nearly as sympathetic to Requiem.
    Depending on your usage, Kievit should pair quite well with Requiem. \r\n\r\nUse
    fonts by the same designer when that designer tends to make a lot of type that's
    similar (Zapf, Unger, Gill); but with eclectic designers like Hoefler, Schwartz
    and Carter, it's not as safe a policy. "
