  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Everyone,

I'm working on a logo revision for a company called "Urgent Career". Basically they offer a service that entails phone based interviews. I'm attaching their original concept, along with my revised one.

Basically I'm trying to clean things up and simplify the concept. I decided to take the bars (phone signal strength obviously) and titled it to create the arrow—which reinforces the word "URGENT". "URGENT" is also used for the base of the arrow. I set "CAREER" in black because I really wanted it to stand out. I kept reading their company name as "Urgent Care" and really wanted people to realized the difference.

Anyway, any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike

The relative simplicity of the new one is better - but I think it needs to keep going and to get a core graphic idea/hook other than bars/phone.

What about that word urgent?</div>

But I will say good job getting rid of the reflection and orange/blue color scheme. I really like your new version. It is clean and professional, yet comfortable and approachable, especially on the manilla-envelope-colored background.</div>

Maybe you could keep that same basic arrow shape but make it into a flip-top cell phone. That would make the telephone idea stronger.</div>

I think this design works well, although I think that the cell phone bars are not immediately apparent.  I would like to see the spacing worked on, however.  It seems like the arrow is too close to "URGENT."  Also, I would like to see it in black against a white background.
