  or non-commercially without acquiring copyright permission as long as you will not
  profit from the use of the font.\"\r\n\r\nIsn't that a contradictory statement?
  What would a commercial purpose that I *don't* profit from be?\r\n\r\nI've just
  started trying to freelance and when I need to get permission to use a font for
  a project is still a bit of a mystery to me, any help there would be appreciated."

    or some other upstanding company, and providing you were not paid to create the
    identity (you could have them pay a friend, or donate the fee to charity), they
    could use it. \r\n\r\nOf course you would have to remain anonymous and not have
    your name associated with the work, otherwise you might \"profit\" from it indirectly
    given the positive PR around the logo.  "

    made sense. I'll get right on my pro bono Halliburton work ;)\r\n\r\nThanks."
