body: "[This snippet of information has been sitting in my email folder for a few
  years now, and whenever I need to calculate an accurate BlueScale value in a font,
  I have to go and find the message from Adobe font tester extradordinaire Ernie March
  in which the equation occured. So this wiki entry exists in part to make it easier
  for me to find the information when I need it, but I figured others might like to
  know how to correctly set the BluesSale value for a PS font (Type 1 or CFF OpenType.]\r\n\r\nThe
  BlueScale value can be expressed in a number of ways, and one sometimes sees it
  expressed in point size. In the following, the BlueScale is expressed 'as it is'
  (to use FontLab's terminology), i.e. as a positive real number value.\r\n\r\nA correctly
  set BlueScale value is relative to the largest BlueZone (vertical alignment zone)
  in a given font, which in turn is relative to the UPM value. It should be noted
  that the default BlueScale value suggested by font tools usually presumes a UPM
  of 1000, so fonts with larger UPM values, e.g. 2048, will need to have the BlueScale
  recalculated. Similarly, if a font has a particularly large BlueZone, the BlueScale
  may need to be recalculated even for a font with a UPM of 1000.\r\n\r\nA correct
  BlueScale value will equal to or less than 1/x, where x is the height of the largest
  BlueZone in the font.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, if the largest BlueZone in the font
  is 36 units, the BlueScale value should be equal to or less than 0.027777777777777777777777777777778.
  [In this case, I would typically set the value to 0.0276.]"
