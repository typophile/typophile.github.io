    and feature suggestions:</strong>\r\n<ol><li><strong>Voting</strong> which may
    remove the need for repeating the same replies by simply upvoting those that one
    agrees with. Although this voting should have some more meaning related to it.
    Replies that have higher upvotes should become <em>visually more prominent</em>
    (not by changing replies order) compared to those that may even receive downvotes.</li>\r\n<li>And
    even though this site became very mobile friendly I don't like the non responsive
    approach because its <strong>usability on desktops</strong> is now very much hindered.
    It should at least limit it's content width. Nowadays designers having huge displays
    with huge resolutions makes this page lets just mildly put it <em>unreadable</em>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>No
    support for markdown?</strong> These days many sites where users add formatted
    content use markdown instead of HTML tags. Markdown is so much simpler, a whole
    lot quicker to type and simple for server side processing. It would be great if
    you'd support MD formatting. If MD is not something you'd like to support then
    at least implement keyboard shortcuts for <code>Ctrl+B</code>, <code>Ctrl+I</code>
    etc. which would insert tags into types content either at caret position or around
    selection. This is a rather simple thing to do.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Formatted
    preview</strong> can be enabled but it will only display what's been typed and
    won't auto update if one continues editing. <em>Update button</em> is also placed
    after content instead of below edit box.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nAbout the keyboard
    shortcuts this code might help a bit. Very simple and does the trick pretty well...\r\n<code>$(function()

    text is so deathly pale, I can barely read it. Or not at all (the date/time lines).\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Re-fhew! Got enough local styling up that I can read Typophile without eyeburn."

  body: "Fonts on the New Post page are very small, much too small to read easily
    on a HD Mac (not Retina, though). \r\nThere is no left margin for the text. All
    lines begin at the left edge of the window. Not good.\r\nUI of this page is confusing.
    I expect to see a \"Post\" or \"Submit\" button, but the only thing is the \"Save\"
    button, which is already checked."

    body: Couldn't agree more... And these are just the tip of the iceberg. The new
      site seems to be a drawback compared to what it was. I'm sure intentions were
      good, but the end result isn't what was expected.

  body: "Hmm\u2026 Maybe the name \u2018Type ID\u2019 is too obscure for the muggles?
    Do you think that changing it to \u2018Font ID\u2019 and setting it like the \u2018TPHL\u2019
    except blinking red and orange would help catching them?"

    body: I also think that the main problem is wrong wording of this to actually
      point users seeking it to post everywhere... Why not simply rename it to <b>Identify
      font</b>. It would be on the header, we could see it renaming alone works or
      not and then decide whether it also needs more prominence... But renaming in
      my opinion is critical.

    And Firefox warns me that the login page is not secure. I have logged in anyway,
    fulfilling my quota of risk-seeking behavior for today.

    much done, for the foreseeable/near future. Sorry, just tired of the spam, the
    medium gray text I am writing in a light gray box, and... that's enough, actually.\r\nGood
