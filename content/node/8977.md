body: 'as one of the 2005 editors for my university&#39;s student magazine &#40;officially
  it&#39;s a newspaper, but the design, footprint, and publication schedule make it
  feel more like a magazine&#41;, i&#39;m in charge of &#40;re&#41;designing the masthead.
  <BR> <BR>this has been giving me grief and headaches for days now. i&#39;ve got
  a few &#40;half-finished/half-baked&#41; ideas &#40;the edges are very rough, stray
  points here and there&#41;: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.somnambulist.org/crap/vertigoideas.gif">low-res
  gif</a> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.somnambulist.org/crap/vertigoideas.pdf">...and
  the pdf</a> <BR> <BR>- i quite like the top one, but i worry about legibility. <BR>-
  the r and t in the second one feel unresolved. and the o hangs off the edge. <BR>-
  i&#39;ve been staring at these for too long now. my brain&#39;s broken -- any feedback
  appreciated. <BR> <BR>some afterthoughts/background info: <BR>these seem a bit &#39;techy&#39;,
  maybe? the magazine&#39;s always had a sort of &#39;grungy/street&#39; feel to it
  &#40;which i would like to keep, but not as an overarching/exclusive visual theme&#41;
  - it&#39;s a fairly low budget, politicised/lefty magazine, distributed for free
  in stands on and around campus&#41;'

  body: 'Frankly, I like the direction. It&#39;s less &#39;tech&#39; to me and more
    &#39;funky, so bad it&#39;s hip-retro&#39; it&#39;s more &#39;low-tech&#39; to
    me because it feels self-consciously dated. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s appropriate,
    but it&#39;s interesting. The rest of the mag would have to keep up with it, tho.
    <BR> <BR>I like #3, since the implied connection between the descenders could
    hold date/issue/subhead info in it. The &#39;g&#39; doesn&#39;t read right away.
    It reads a bit like &#39;vertieo&#39; at first glance, but you might get around
    that by making the upper-left curve of the bowl into a corner. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    some distressing or faux-wear will make it feel more suited to the publication.'
