  looked over at myfonts.com and found out the closer font is Friz Quadrata. Is this
  a custom font or is there a font similar to FQ without serifs?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avangard_5918.png]"

    know if this font exists.\r\nThere is a sans serif specimen that looks partially
    based on Friz Quadrata shapes: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itf-alanmeeks/colosseum/
    | Colosseum]]\r\n\r\nHope could help you.\r\n\r\nCheers."
