  last 2 months. Long story short I purchased multiple cuts of the font Pill Gothic
  for a large scale project. I work in the broadcast industry in Canada and need some
  modifications made to the font. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Convert the Open
  type to true type\r\n2. Tweak the kerning on a number of character sets\r\n3. Replace
  the lowercase \"a\" with the alternate a\r\n\r\nChris agreed to make these modifications
  but has been missing in action for the last two months. I've sent numerous emails
  with no response. Our deadlines are fast approaching and I need to get in contact
  with him. If anyone can provide me with any help or direction it would be much appreciated."

    the designer if you can legally. Did the designer sign an agreement with you to
    make these mods? If he did you might want to check the contract section on breach
    of contract and see if it allows you to source these modifications through a third
    party. If it does I might be inclined to hire a professional type designer to
    make these modifications. \r\n\r\nIf there's no formal agreement, check the EULA
    and see if that allows end-user modifications. If it doesn't I would find a different
    font. You don't want to risk violating the EULA to which you agreed on a high
    profile broadcast project... http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/08/nbc-sued-over-fonts_n_314394.html

    You may not commission a third party to modify the Fonts without first gaining

    directing you to contact VEER if mods are required.\r\n\r\nSo, one question is,
    where did you purchase it? Did you save your EULA?\r\n"

    still, it appears Chris did give permission, so you should probably contact them.
    I believe they <em>can</em> do the work, if they <em>may.</em>

  body: Unfortunately The FontShop will not make the modifications without Betatype's
    permission. They have spent the last month trying to get in contact with him but
    have had no luck. They have basically said that we should look at another font
    and feel they have something in their library that is close match to Pill Gothic.
    At this time, I'm not big on this solution.

    fix it yourself, or find someone within your organization (the MyFonts EULA prohibits
    3rd parties) to fix it. \r\n\r\nIt's kind of like in the movies where the flight
    attendant asks the passengers if anyone on board knows how to fly a plane - the
    modifications you mention all seem pretty easy, so if you have the right tools
    a professional can likely talk you through getting your project safely on the
    ground. "

  body: "I was a little surprised when someone pointed me to this thread this morning.
    I don't need to get into the details of our one short phone conversation, but
    there was no contract or agreement. I did, however, explain that Stephen could
    have anyone make modifications to the fonts under Betatype's EULA. For the record,
    the Betatype license is extremely liberal with font modifications. It basically
    says, make any modifications you want, as long as you use the modified font under
    the terms of the original license. \r\n\r\nKudos to the folks at FontShop for
    taking an ethical stance on Font mods. I'm sure they will do a great job with
    any required changes. Again, this is an odd conversation for a public forum, but
    if you have any additional questions, feel free to email or direct message through
    Typophile, Betatype or Twitter @bttp. At any rate, I'm glad that this could get
    sorted out, and thanks for using Pill Gothic. I'm interested to see the results."
