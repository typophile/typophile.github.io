  type impressions I would like to use words which consists of 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13
  characters. Can you help me with provinding words in your native language? I like
  words which have something to do with baking cakes. Can you also write what the
  words mean in English?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nPieter"

    words:\r\n\r\n<strong>10 Letters</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Baumkuchen</strong> \u2013
    <a href=\"http://baumkuchenexport.com/wp-baumkuchen.jpeg\">a kind of supposedly
    German cake</a> that, paradoxically, is especially well known outside of Germany;
    only time I ever had it was in Tokyo. Horribly sweet! The reason it's called \"Tree
    Cake\" is because it's round, and has this layered structure inside.\r\n\r\n<strong>Backpulver</strong>
    \u2013 baking powder\r\n\r\n<strong>P\xFCrierstab</strong> \u2013 euh... little
    handheld mixer that has the rotating blades to blend/mince stuff. <a href=\"http://www.dynamicmixers.de/media/pp97__079539000_1513_25042006.jpg\">This</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Springform</strong>
    \u2013 round, unhingable baking dish for cakes (see <a href=\"http://www.rezepte-sammlung.net/images/Springform_klein_2aa8c97d6a77b1f519830a8fb43def38.jpg\">here</a>)\r\n\r\n<strong>11
    Letters</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Schneebesen</strong> \u2013 whisk (if that is
    what <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Schneebesen1.JPG\">this</a>
    is called) \u2013 the German word is actually compiled of \"snow\" and \"broom\"
    (but I swear it's the correct word!)\r\n\r\n<strong>12 Letters</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Marmorkuchen</strong>
    \u2013 literally \"marble cake\", a type of cake that consists of 2 different
    doughs that are kind of flowing into one another, looks like <a href=\"http://www.rezeptebuch24.de/bilder/gerichte/Kuchen/Marmorkuchen6536gross.jpg\">this</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Schwingbesen</strong>
    \u2013 Specifically Swiss expression for Schneebesen (see above)\r\n\r\n<strong>Teigsch\xFCssel</strong>
    \u2013 Dough Bowl, the bowl you'd prepare the dough for a cake in\r\n\r\n<strong>13
    Letters</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Handr\xFChrger\xE4t</strong> \u2013 Again, sort
    of like a mixer, but the thing you hold in your hand to mix stuff with \u2026
    argh, my English vocabulary is horrible tonight. Anyway, the thing looks like
    <a href=\"http://www.d-living.de/images/products/images/0810160347.jpg\">this</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    have one with 14 if you want it, too:\r\n\r\n<strong>Streuselkuchen</strong> \u2013
    I'm not even going to attempt to describe <a href=\"http://www.foolforfood.de/media/streuselkuchen_03.jpg\">this
    German cake</a>. \"Streusel\" are the crumbs on top, which are essentially made
    of butter and sugar. Mmm. "

    only even vaguely cake-related Swahili term I know is <em>maandazi</em>, a sort
    of fried bread. Eight letters only, though, and not really what one would think
    of as \"cake\" (more like a doughnut, really)...\r\n\r\nSearching in the dictionary
    turns up some words, but most have even fewer letters. Another eight-letter entry
    is <em>kinyunya</em> (plural <em>vinyunya</em>), meaning confection, candy, or
    cake. Well, I tried. I don't even remember seeing much cake in Kenya. It's not
    really part of the traditional cuisine."
