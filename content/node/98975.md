body: "Good evening ladies and gents.\r\n\r\nTo keep it short, I've been working on
  this typeface for a while and I would be thankful to receive some feedback on it.
  It's condensed, and the idea came from that cryptic text at the bottom of movie
  posters that nobody ever reads. Except its purpose is not to be entirely invisible
  and that the design took many many turns since then.\r\n\r\nI realize it looks a
  bit like URW Grotesk Condensed, although I was actually unaware of that until recently.\r\n\r\nSo
  far, I really feel I'm not doing this font a lot of justice - in that, it is too
  plain, too boring, and has little personality. Or maybe I've just been looking at
  it for too long. Oh and I made a tz ligature, just because I think it's pretty.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  here it is:\r\n\r\n(a dropbox link in case the attachment thing doesn't work right)\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/2982701/Director/Specimen%2017.12.2012.pdf\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you want it to look more interesting you will have to think outside the
    box. A hackneyed phrase, I know, but still an appropriate one here.\r\n\r\nYou
    are playing a fairly well closed out design form here.  You wont be able to look
    different until you change it somehow."

  body: "This doesn't have to end up being boring, plus I think you can make this
    style work for Hebrew. BUT: at least in the Latin the proportions are mostly pretty
    bad, sorry to say. A good shortcut would be to study an existing reputable font
    in this style.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Catharsis,\r\n\r\nGood point, I'll look into it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nhrant,\r\n\r\nThanks
    for you feedback. When you mean proportions, I'm guessing you mean width of letters
    but also proportions of top and bottom portions of letters? If so, which stick
    out?"
