  body: "At a minimum, I wish Adobe would open-spec the file formats for Freehand
    and other back-catalog products (such as Extreme 3D); then at least filters could
    be developed so that users could access their legacy files in current programs.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Freehand is dead and has been for many, many years. (Many claim it's been
    dead since version 8). It will never be open sourced. The codebase is antiquated
    and it'd be a dumb business move on Adobe's part.\r\n\r\nCuttle...I agree, though
    I imagine they'll keep that for themselves as a 'force the hand' way to cross-grade
    companies to illustrator.\r\n\r\nFor a real open source alternative, there's inkscape:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.inkscape.org/\r\n\r\nHas
    a long way to go, but is an impressive app.\r\n\r\n(And thanks for the link to
    MNteractive!)"

    Illustrator will never be good, so long as competition is non existant. You can
    take that to the bank.\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you free"

  body: "What, you mean Corel Draw isn't competition for Illustrator?\r\n;P\r\n\r\nSo
    long as they refuse to make a new Mac version it isn't, among its other issues,
    but it looks similar enough to the general population, or me, at least."
