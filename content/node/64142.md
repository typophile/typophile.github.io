  guys thought.\r\n\r\nwhat do you all think?"

  body: "First thoughts: I really like it, especially the face! The type is tasteful
    as well.\r\nYou could easily use it like this, but if you would ask me how you
    could improve it I would look at the following: It's a bit too perfect and neat
    now, the logo is all boxed up and the type is centered under it. I think it would
    do the face more justice if you tried to find a more exciting combination with
    the type and the colours. It could be a bank logo now, make it a bit more into
    a designer logo (whatever that may be), experiment a bit more, do some weird stuff.
    So I think the elements are all good, but play around a bit more and don't go
    for the classical solution neccesarily. And try to find a typeface that is a match
    for your lion logo ;)\r\n\r\nKeep us posted!\r\n\r\ngreetings Jeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: "This is great! I actually really like the restraint in it \u2013 I think
    it can makes the \"huh?\" effect (once one discovers the ambiguity of the face)
    more powerful than if everything was \"playful\". And the \"designer\" aspect,
    hey, it's in the glasses ;-)\r\n\r\nThat said, it does look subdued, even potentially
    depressed, especially with the lowish-contrast blue color scheme. But I know lions
    don't smile. :-)  Maybe try a *slightly* stronger contrast?\r\n\r\nOh, and I'd
    try removing the sideways (left/right) boundaries of the nose."

    bit more danger and frivolity won't hurt though, even if it's restrained, it's
    still a lion! :)\r\n\r\nI'm thinking along the lines of JAWS; Nothing seems wrong

  body: "I think I agree with Queneau, it's perhaps a little too perfect, or neat.\r\n\r\nIf
    I were you, I'd try a version where the face doesn't sit in a box. And maybe make
    your illustration a little more natural, so that perhaps the face isn't perfectly
    symmetrical or the lines aren't so straight, if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nBut I
    do think this has promise and could be a strong approach to a personal identity. "

    rather restrained, clean, and cool, in which case this would be a perfect fit.
    \r\nI think the \"voice\" in which his logo should speak really needs to be his
    decision."

  body: "Thank you for the comments guys! It's really refreshing to hear different
    points of view. This is the color scheme I plan on using for my identity, but
    I'm not sure which to use for the actual logo yet, or if it could be interchangeable
    depending on the medium. As far as the type goes, I agree that I should experiment
    with the placement, and I'm not to sure about the weight either. I do like the
    typeface itself though. \r\n\r\n@ Peter_vii, I tried having the lion face without
    the box, but it creates a sort of \"reversed\" look (preview bellow). The way
    it is illustrated, I feel it needs to be housed in something darker then itself.
    \ \r\n\r\n@ Nina, thank you for bringing that up. I do believe my style is clean
    and rather restrained compared to most. I should have mentioned that earlier,
    because I do want the logo to be a reflection of my work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture14_5220.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture15_5089.png]"

  body: "Wow, that must be the calmest lion I've ever met. :-)\r\n\r\nWhat's the font
    you're using? Looks like a rougher sibling to Gotham. It's curious that the \"O\"s
    don't appear to have any overshoot\u2026 Especially in the heavier weights that
    seems unexpectedly quirky, and potentially distracting. And the lower bowl of
    the \"B\" might also need some work.\r\nIn terms of font weight, I wouldn't go
    *too* light \u2013 that *is* a lion after all, not a nightingale. ;-)"

- body: "After you work out all the kinks that altaira mentions, I'd like to see the
    name stacked under (or next to) the mark. The two names look about the same length
    and they might form a nice rectangle that relates better to the square of the
    lion. \r\n\r\nThe top two lions are the best colors, IMO, but frankly they're
    all nice. The weight of the middle typeface (3rd) feels about right. "

  body: Im against making designer logos in the first place. as a rule of thumb you
    will hate it the second you finish it no matter what it is (because you are a
    designer). that said, i think the lion needs a little more stylistic umpff. Pretty
    good but a little too boring, maybe a bit more abstract, and it would be nice
    to see some of the shapes get a bit more organic to contrast with the geometric.
    but, good job generally speaking.

  body: "Re: Keep or lose the box...\r\n\r\nKeep the box.  It provides the mane of
    the lion.  Makes it read clearer as a lion.\r\n\r\nRe: Alaskan\r\n\r\nI agree.
    \ The type should appear either under the logo or to the right of the logo.  There
    should be some relationship between the width or height of type to the logo.  If
    the type is placed underneath, then justify the type to the width of the logo.
    \ If the type is placed to the right, justify the size of logo between the the
    baseline and cap-height of the type.  Of course this will give more prominence
    to the logo to the type.  Say either your mark is more important or your name
    is.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thought regarding typography selection.  If stay with
    a geometric font I would justify the size as described above.  However, if you
    are looking for contrast, you might go with a script or some other \"less blocky\"
    font to contrast with the logo's blockiness.  However, that depends on the personal
    aesthetic you are trying to convey to a would-be client or employer.  Are you
    projecting: \"I am good at maintaining continuity and relationships in my design.\"
    \ or, \"I am good at conveying tension, conversation, or counterpoints, in my
    design.\"  I am echoing \"altaira\", above.\r\n\r\nEither way, the logo is aesthetically
    pleasing and feels like a mark.  \r\n\r\nBest.  \r\n\r\n"

    of work do you do?\r\n2. Who are your clients (current/future)?\r\n3. What are
    your goals?\r\n\r\nWithout a clear definition of context we're simply taking aesthetic
    shots across the bow until someone gets lucky. Clear definition of context lets
    you base decisions on fitness for purpose. As this removes guesswork, it is often
    significantly more efficient and provides you (and your clients) a greater return
    on investment. However, I'm a hardcore functionalist.\r\n\r\nRegarding the type,
    I think the type face is fine, but it could use some kerning. Additionally, typographic
    <em>convention</em> considers letter-spacing (tracking) capital letters to be
    more \"sophisticated.\" Additionally, it is believed that it assists in individual
    character recognition but I have yet to read a study that supports this claim
    (thesis topic)."

  body: "Additional tips on a purely syntactic level:\r\n\r\n1. Do a black and white
    version. Do this for black on white <em>and</em> white on black. This will raise
    the \"should I put a box around it?\" issue. If you don't go with a \"box\" for
    dropouts, then you'll need to think consistent safezone.\r\n\r\n2. Do the same
    for greyscale. When you reduce your colour palette to greyscale it will surface
    colours with different hues but similar saturation and brightness.\r\n\r\n3. Reduce
    the size of your icon to 32 x 32 pixels to see how it fairs as an icon.\r\n\r\n4.
    What's the smallest size possible it will ever appear? Screen and print. Chances
    are the type won't be any smaller than eight points. Is the icon still legible
    at this size?"
