body: "I have a challenge with a brochure series I designed awhile ago. It was originally
  in English, but now the client wishes it to be translated into Turkish. I used Sava
  Pro for the font. As an all CAPS font, it doesn't show the dotted or non-dotted
  \"i\" in Turkish. However, it DOES include a dotted \"i\" (both CAPITAL and lowercase)
  in the character map. \r\n\r\nAm I going to need to go to EVERY single dotted and
  non-dotted \"i\" and manually change the character? Any advice is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI
  guess a plan B would be to find a similar font to replace it, but I really don't
  want to do that.\r\n\r\nthanks-\r\npaul"

  body: I'm using InDesign CS3 Middle East version. I've been using the glyph palette
    to select the needed characters, but it is very labor intensive. I didn't use
    Sava for the primary body text, but to change it for headings still requires a
    lot of time.

  body: "Here's an example:\r\n\r\n\"\u0130sa Yasa\u2019y\u0131 Yok Etmek \u0130\xE7in
    Mi Geldi? \"\r\n\r\nNotice that the capital \"I\" can sometimes have a dot above
    it. Lowercase has both dotted and non-dotted i. I suppose I could do a find and
    replace for every dotted lowercase \"i\". But that would change each character
    in the body text too, and those are showing up fine with the body font. It also
    replaces the dotted \"i\" differently by font WEIGHT as well. So when I replace
    every \"i\" with Sava Pro Regular, some of them are Sava Pro Light. So I end up
    doing it manually anyway.\r\n\r\nI was just thinking there might be a way to say
    \"Ok InDesign, I'm working in Turkish today.\" and it would respond with a friendly
    \"tamam\"."

  body: You know that you can set the language of the text right? (It's a character
    level format choice...find it in the character palette). Does that help?
