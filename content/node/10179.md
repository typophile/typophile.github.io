body: Some type designs ... eg Univers, Times Ten, Sabon, Helvetica, New Century Schoolbook
  and Courier ... can be supplied with cyrillic letterforms, as well as the diacritics
  used in Latvian. <BR> <BR>The abovementioned fonts are all from Linotype. But perhaps
  other type libraries have other fonts. How do I get to know just how many designs
  there are? <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

    support both Adobe Cyrillic and Adobe CE languages &#40;including Latvian&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Those are among the fonts listed on our Cyrillic page here: <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/C/C_cyrillic.html"

    <BR>Also, our next couple of releases, Garamond Premier Pro and Hypatia Sans Pro,
    will support those languages. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

    the name mean? <BR>3&#41; How do we pronounce it?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Its kind of a geometric sans with a lot of humanist touches. Or maybe a humanist
    sans with some geometric characteristics in the lowercase. The caps are very much
    in the classic Roman proportions. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s named after the Greek philosopher
    and mathematician who was torn to pieces by a mob in Alexandria as part of a religious/political
    conflict. Some sources suggest she was the last head librarian of the famous library,
    though in truth this seems doubtful. <BR> <BR>Pronouncing it is an interesting
    question. I understand the Greek way would be something like ee&#39;-pah-tee&#34;-a
    &#40;heaviest stress on the third syllable&#41;. But I only have that second-hand
    &#40;Gerry Leonidas via David Lemon&#41;. The typical western way would be high&#39;-pay&#34;-she-uh
    or high&#39;-pay&#34;-sha. I tend to go for the last one myself. I guess since
    it&#39;s my typeface that makes it the one true way?

    I guess since it&#39;s my typeface that makes it the one true way? <BR> <BR>Not
    in practice.  :-&#41; <BR>Since you&#39;ll have virtually no opportunity to recommend
    pronunciation&#42;, it&#39;s really out of your hands. My guess is it will vary
    a lot based on geography: Americans will tend to pronounce it &#34;high-pay-shia&#34;&#42;&#42;
    while Europeans will say something like &#34;hee-patia&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Just
    like the usage itself of the font! <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Hmmm, sounds like an Iranian

  body: They always pronounced the name of the porn star Hypatia Lee &#34;high-PAY-sha
    LEE&#34;. Which is also the first thing I think of whenever I see the name Hypatia.
    My humanities teachers would be so proud.

    ... <BR>I haven&#39;t been that active in typophile the recent years ... but I
    remember how many of your postings I enjoyed to or three years ago &#40;a lifetime&#41;
    in the typography newsgroup. Roy Preston was there, too, but he doesn&#39;t seem
    to have crossed over to typophile. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O
