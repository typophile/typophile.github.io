  a double-decker, typographic style \"a\"?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mingler_a_variations_4907.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on an update to my old Mingler font. \r\n\r\nIt's been used in pizza commercials
  and ads for a \r\nfew years now, but now I get to give it a facelift\r\nand re-issue
  it at my site soon.\r\n\r\nI wanna change the \"a\" and I could kinda go either.\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm wondering, which do you like better?\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n"

  body: I prefer the roman double decker. The cursive one looks a bit like an o at
    small sizes. And the double decker looks more funky.

  body: Yeah, the two-story a seems to fit the style more, IMHO.
