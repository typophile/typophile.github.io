  just published the first of many books to come on the topic of type in our environment.
  We often overlook some great examples of typography as we go about our daily lives.
  FOUND focuses in on those subtle examples as well as dramatic ones, such as signs
  and graffiti. For the first edition of FOUND I have focused in on Springfield, OH
  and all of the forgotten type that it holds. Next up Seattle, WA.\r\n\r\nPreview
  and pick up your copy at http://www.lulu.com/content/379191.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n--

    examples for every letter.\r\nI like these kind of things as reminders of the
    beauty all around us."

    body: Yeah, I've seen some of those. Really nice stuff. This book is more of a
      zine for this first go round. The images just weren't the quality I would have
      liked. But it's still cool in a zine kind of way. Those rich full color images
      are just tasty.

    body: "I'm a resident of Springfield. It's an old industrial town and has a huge
      amount of leftover signage and what not from that time frame. A good slice of
      a common midwest industrial town. The history in the book is pulled from Wikepedia
      and has a lot of interesting tidbits. My favorite is that the first official
      jail was guarded by a black bear.\r\n\r\nSeattle is my next book. Should be
      cool.\r\n\r\nI also want to do one on old sheet music typographic illustrations.
      Some nice stuff there.\r\n\r\n--ah"
