body: "Hello people, how are we?\r\n\r\nI am working on a logo for a sportswear company
  I am starting up.\r\n\r\nThe company name is fourmation, I did want to use the company
  name formation but couldn't. I then justified calling it fourmation because of the
  numbers used for formations in sport etc...drill me if I need drilling haha.\r\n\r\nFirst
  option:\r\n\r\nI decided that because its a logo going on sportswear that in needs
  to be simple, effective and work in one colour only. Attached is a concept that
  stood out for me, the word fourmation will appear below it. I wanted the logo to
  refer to the number four somehow but not in a cliche way...I am sure we call all
  dream up something in no time using the number 4, I didn't want it to be that easy.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see in the logo there is both a \"f\" and a \"4\", I need to know if this
  is obvious enough to work? I am worried that the 4 doesn't look convincing enough,
  am I right?\r\n\r\nSecond option:\r\n\r\nI have showen this logo to a few people
  and they love it, out off all the concepts I have showen them they seem to go straight
  to this one? Does anyone else here like it? I personally are very unsure\r\n\r\nPlease
  help!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fourmation_5576_5489.jpeg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6190.jpg]"

    Enough said? \r\n\r\nMichael; I too like the first version, but something needs
    to be done to ensure it doesn't feel like a swastika. Color should solve that;
    perhaps even just 50% gray would add a touch of class and sleek elegance. I picture
    it as a zipper pull and embroidered in a nice steely, silvery gray."

  body: "As a designer I like 1st option much better. The second option is too straight
    forward that is why I think non-designer like it more...they don't like the guessing
    game.\r\n\r\nThe mark is great imo. I would be interested to see how the word
    \"Fourmation\" is position around it."

  body: I like the first version. For some reason the "4" in the "O" throws me off,
    and at first glance it looks like an "A."

- body: "mrgraphics: I was just saying your version just doesn't work. It's inexplicably
    forced, totally illegible unless it's huge, and your placement of the word \"fourmation\"
    awkwardly breaks the flow and boldness of the graphic. \r\n\r\nBut, since you
    asked....it is considered by many here on Typophile to be bad form to post design
    revisions of somebody else's design-in-progress. If the re-design you post turns
    out to be a great idea, it puts the commissioned designer in an untenable position:
    either stealing your design work, or, being forced to abandon a great idea because
    they <em>don't want to steal</em> another designer's work. \r\n\r\nIt's an ethics
    problem, if not a question of personal integrity. So, if you have a helpful idea,
    it's best, IMHO, just to write your idea rather than post a revised design. Plus,
    writing helps develop your ability to communicate graphics verbally, and that's
    something invaluable when dealing with clients. "

  body: For what it's worth, I think the first is just a bit too much like the Umbro
    diamond for comfort. As it's going on sportswear, that would make me twitchy.
