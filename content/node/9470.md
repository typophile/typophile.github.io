body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I am attempting to create a comics font in FontLab. I&#39;ve
  been having some problems with how the font looks in FontLab, compared to how it
  looks in other programs once it&#39;s been created.  <BR> <BR>For example, in the
  image below, note how the &#34;...&#34; at the end of the sentance differs. The
  top one is how it looks in FontLab &#40;and how i would like it to look&#41;.  The
  bottom one is how it looks in Illustrator once I create the font. The spacing between
  the dot dot dots is quite noticable.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m exporting the font as TTF.  <BR>
  <BR>Any thoughts on this would be most appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Thanks very much,
  <BR>Colin White <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/66240.jpg"

    space character about 30% . . . <BR> <BR>:D

  body: The difference between the two in generally erratic, and the font lab version
    is better &#40;though I agree with stuart letterspacing is toooo tight, and the
    space between words toooo large&#41;. My guess is that the kerning is to blame.
    In font lab you have kerning turned off. In illustrator, I bet it is on &#40;and
    brutalizing your nice work, see the qu for example&#41;. To see if that&#39;s
    what is happening click the K button in the FL metrics window and compare. <BR>
    <BR>Did you hit Autokern? A dangerous and sometimes useful game. <BR>If that is
    what it is, get rid of all the kerning in the font, and just do a limited number
    of pairs by hand. Do a search for kerning pairs on typophile to get a list of
    recommended pairs. <BR> <BR>R
