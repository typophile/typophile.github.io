  of and have had no luck.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas what this font might\r\nbe?
  \ The lettering is \"ADIM\".  And I'm\r\nguessing that the \"A\" doesn't cut into
  the\r\n\"D\" on the normal font...must just be designed\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the font sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_style_6019.gif]\r\n\r\nLet
  me know what you think.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-- DC"

  body: "I'm afraid you'll have trouble finding a free font of quality that is adequately
    similar. Spend the $29. It is worth the trouble and you'll have the flexibility
    of expanding the family by getting the other weights of Magistral \u2014 something
    that is very uncommon among free fonts."
