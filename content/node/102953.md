body: I've been trying to identify this font recently. While the included sample is
  clear, more examples of the font can be found at [[https://www.goruck.com/events]]
  (abit lower quality) in the words "LIGHT, HEAVY, SELECTION, TREK, BEACHED," etc..
  Thanks for your help.

  body: Looks pretty dead on to me. I am surprised that none of the "upload/search"
    tools couldn't ID it for me. Thanks a bunch!
