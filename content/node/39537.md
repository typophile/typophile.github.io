  want Times New Roman, and that's what the engraver uses most of the time. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEileen\r\n"

    hobbies, interests. Not all of that can be expressed through a typeface, but it
    would give us something to go on in offering selections.\r\n\r\nThere are considerations
    in lettering design for monuments to forestall erosion and such, but with modern
    techniques that usually involve sandblasting through a computer-cut template into
    very hard stone such as granite, those considerations don't really apply."

  body: "First off, quite sorry for your loss. \r\n\r\nYou should keep in mind, that
    some of the most beautiful stones are done by hand-lettering... even though the
    above examples are quite nice in their own right, they are some examples of less
    refined hand carved lettering... or rather, very stylized versions. \r\n\r\nA
    good stone letter carver letterforms can be as nicely refined as formal typefaces...
    with those small idiosyncracies that make them amazing. Granted, it is pricier...
    although I do not think that it is prohibitively so. \r\n\r\nIf you choose a font
    / typeface, it will most likely be sandblasted on the stone... giving perfection
    and a flat back... whereas with hand done lettering, you get those really nice
    V cuts within the letterforms.\r\n\r\nI am sure, whatever you do, it will be the
    right + nice solution for you, however, I would keep solid hand carved letters
    in mind if it is a priority to get the most beautiful results possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I rather like Aichel.\r\n\r\nTo answer the questions thus far ... \r\n\r\nMy dad
    lived his entire life in the Boston area, but I'd love suggestions for stone carvers
    anywhere in the northeast. I've only visited one monument shop, and it wasn't
    memorable.\r\n\r\nI'd love hand carved lettering, but I'm not opposed to a well
    crafted sandblasted stone. The photos posted above are gorgeous, but are too flourished
    for my dad -- and the stone will have my mother's name added when she dies, and
    she prefers a more simple, somewhat stoic look.\r\n\r\nAbout my dad?  Well, his
    parents came over on the boat, literally, from Ireland just before he was born.
    \ I'd love the stone to have an old world feel with just a touch of Ireland implied.
    \ He was a very simple, understated man, often quiet, and exceedingly kind. I
    don't think he had a single mean thought in his entire life. <a href=\"http://www.asimas.com/ASIMAS/everett/obituaryDescription.jsp?domain_id=224&deceased_id=141638\">His
