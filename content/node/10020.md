  body: There is a lot of Gill used, so it may have been based on that. <BR> <BR>It
    looks more like a slanted <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/bold/testdrive.html?s=FIATC&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">normal</a> than a true <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/bold/testdrive.html?s=FIATC&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">italic</a> to me. <BR> <BR>The M seems to be based on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-black-sb/regular/testdrive.html?s=M&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Futura Black</a> with an F drawn to suit. <BR> <BR>There looks
    to be a vectorised version of the logo in a PDF file  <BR><a href="http://www.fiatc.es/internet/ges001.nsf/6bdb3b15e850b696c125697e003f8dc4/acd3f1a3ce759227c1256cec0042ab61/$FILE/info_20.pdf"
