body: "Hello again-\r\n\r\nThis is Telltale, a study of low contrast in serif style.
  Once again it is fairly narrow to work in Finnish language (\xE4\xE4li\xF6 \xE4l\xE4
  ly\xF6, \xF6\xF6li\xE4 l\xE4ikkyy, senkin sikaniskainen kaupunkiinmuuttajapaskiainen).
  I tried to make it low in contrast without making it look fat.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Telltale_3604.png]\r\nItalics
  are under production, so samples in pdf are somewhat random.\r\n\r\nAny comments?\r\n"

  body: "I wonder if the /s/ serifs close up too much, but its spine is beautifully
    done. The thin long stroke of /y/ looks light to me. Having seen your other fonts
    I'm guessing that the /g/ is untouchable? :-) /M/ looks very good.\r\n\r\nFigures
    look good though both /2/s bug me with that serif, and both /4/s look too slight.\r\n\r\nThe
    name is quite good; I get a storybook vibe from this."

  body: "Looks like a great font is going to be born once more.\r\nDidn't mean to
    say anything at all at first, since it looked so good.\r\n\r\nNow on close inspection
    I'm with eliason about the serif of the 2, (also 7, T, E, s etc). I can see the
    pointed angle is not a bug, it's a feature ;-) but maybe it looks better when
    it's a bit shorter (like with the Euro [lining figures]).\r\nThe right arm of
    the r looks too thick (and perhaps too short) to me, in particular where it connects
    to the stem. \r\nThe axis of the g is out of tune with, say, e or s.\r\nAh, and
    the opening single quote is (mirrored) upside down.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: Thank you for the insight. I attached a new pdf with corrections from your
    posts. That g was really out of wack indeed. And now with more italics.

  body: "I realize I should have been more clear - when I said the /4/s look slight,
    I meant that they look small (especially, narrow), not light. \"Slight\" in proportions,
    not in stroke weight.\r\nI also forgot to mention I'm not persuaded by that @,
    which looks /d/-like and flat on the right.\r\n\r\nItalic /p/ is defintely too
    wide. Italic /e/ probably, too. Italic /u/ might be too narrow? \r\n\r\nDid you
    consider other structures for italic /x/? And a single-story /g/ might be nice
    for the italic (though perhaps that's in the works as an alternate already)."

  body: "Hi, Craig-\r\n\r\nI did get your meaning with 4, just went at it somewhat
    haphazardly.\r\n\r\n@ is something of a pet peeve of mine: generic @ is what it
    is; generic no matter what font you use. Like copying and pasting instead of design.
    Mine is too narrow right now, though.\r\n\r\nItalic p is too wide. And x in work
    in progress, and I do have a single-storey g. I think two-storey should be there
    as an alternate."
