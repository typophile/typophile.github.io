  And I therefore need some inspiration for a font that compliments the logo design,
  and as such could be used as the font for headlines etc. etc. <BR> <BR>What do you
  think of Interstate Regular? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m open to suggestions - comment on the
  logo as well... shoot! <BR> <BR>Thanks and cheers <BR>/Henriko <BR> <BR> <BR><img

  body: Well, for one thing Interstate has a very strong automotive/transportation
    connotation&#42;, which might be good or bad depending on what your company does.
    But also on the formal level I think Interstate is problematic here. I think you
    need something more &#34;rational&#34;, more contemporary. BTW, if you&#39;re
    going to use the font for significant amounts of text, choose a serif one. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; At least in the US. <BR> <BR>BTW, wouldn&#39;t the logo be better with
    no extra space in &#34;SY&#34;? <BR> <BR>hhp

    for the quick response! <BR> <BR>Hrant, first of all my company is not the field
    of transportation <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> - it&#39;s a design agency dealing with identity and corporate
    design. The font I&#39;m looking for is to be used in stationary and smaller headlines.
    <BR> <BR>Could you give me some examples on the serif-types? <BR> <BR>/H <BR>

    me interstate might be nice, but you really should show us all of your thoughts.

  body: Avoid Interstate, especially if you are a design company. AIGA uses it liberally
    - why not differentiate yourself with something like Fedra from Typotheque? They
    also offer a serif version.

  body: I don&#39;t agree that a serif font would be necessarily good for large amounts
    of text. <BR> <BR>It may be controvertial to say this but the idea that a serif
    font is more readable is very much old-school thinking. Modern research, apparently,
    suggests that there&#39;s no significant difference in legibility between serif
    and sans today. Remember, &#34;People read best what they read most&#34;, and
    there&#39;s such an abundance of both serif and sans serif fonts out there in
    use everyday. <BR> <BR>I subscribe to the principle of identity between content
    and expression, so the font you choose should reflect the kind of work you do.
    If it&#39;s technology or design orientate, then a Sans Serif is often more appropriate.
    Unless your design is distinctly retro of course.

  body: 'I&#39;m not even remotely old-school, and I have no doubt that serifs help
    readability. And I believe this not based on much empirical data &#40;99% of it
    is totally flawed&#41; but based mostly on plain old <i>thought</i>: when you
    analyze it &#40;for many years&#41;, it simply makes sense. <BR> <BR>Furthermore,
    the Emigre mantra is over-simple to the point of being false. It serves mostly
    as an escape from responsability. Not to mention that none of its proponents have
    spent more than 5 seconds analyzing Familiarity... But you know what&#39;s really
    ironic? The most fiercely anti-Emigre school &#40;the chirographers&#41; uses
    the Familiarity escape clause to believe in the exact opposite thing! But of course
    they haven&#39;t thought about it much either... <BR> <BR>&#62; the font you choose
    should reflect the kind of work you do. <BR> <BR>Of course. But this is only one
    piece of the puzzle. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Is there anything that I can read about why serifs make things more legible?  I&#39;m
    basically just taking everyone&#39;s word for it, but I don&#39;t know why actually.  When
    I hear stuff like &#34;it just makes sense&#34;, I feel embarassed a bit that
    I don&#39;t get it.

  body: To me the aggregate of data, experience and intuition tells me that serifs
    help reading. There are bits of empirical research &#40;not much, unfortunately&#41;
    that makes sense in the context of what most typographers believe about reading
    and many people believe about human nature. The tons of empirical research that
    point away from the bouma &#40;letter-cluster-shape&#41; model of reading are
    simply flawed when you analyze the details; but they shouldn&#39;t be ignored
    outright &#40;even though that&#39;s what most empiricists do with anecdotal experience,
    sadly&#41;, they should be assimilated. Every bit has to make sense. And in the
    bouma model it does. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no Proof of this &#40;yet&#41;. But
    I for one think that proof is for lab rats. On the other hand, saying &#34;it
    justs makes sense&#34; is indeed unfair - it&#39;s just difficult to elaborate
    all the time, especially since this is <i>not</i> actually a simple topic - not
    at all. It&#39;s like E B Huey said almost a hundred years ago, but sadly academic
    hubris tends to impede self-doubt, tends to put aside the very real paradox that
    numbers don&#39;t lie simply because numbers don&#39;t say anything - we just
    hear them say things, and sometimes we hear what we expect. <BR> <BR>I guess a
    good way to arrive at usable &#40;if tentative&#41; practical conclusions is to
    strike a balance between personal research and trusting others who have done more
    research. The former helps gauge the reliability of the latter, and so does putting
    the latter in context. In my view cognitive scientists can be trusted to generate
    reliable <i>data</i>, but are not in a position to interpret the data properly,
    simply because they &#40;generally&#41; lack any anecdotal experience to guide
    them. They work with assumptions &#40;something inescapable&#41; that originate
    in a vaccum, or from their own personaly &#40;non-typographic&#41; experience.
    <BR> <BR>Whatever you do though, please don&#39;t be afraid to leave the house
    because you have no proof that a car won&#39;t hit you. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Glad I asked. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t you think though, that in marketing communications
    at least, absolute legibility is, more often than not, not an absolute, 100% priority?
    Not least because the drop in readability between a conventional serif and sans
    serif font, if either measured mathematically or judge intuitively, must surely
    be minimal.  <BR> <BR>The appropriate level of readability is also just one part
    of the puzzle. <BR> <BR>The influence a well chosen font has on an identity or
    brand is significant and isn&#39;t that the context of Henrik&#39;s original question,
    which I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve answered &#40;quite possibly my fault&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Henrik, if you&#39;re still there, I&#39;d suggest Frutiger, Bliss or perhaps
    even Berthold&#39;s Imago. None of them are particularly &#34;new&#34; but are
    clean, legible, look contemporary and are well designed. Each has a good range
    of weights and should be readily available for both Mac and PC from any good font
    supplier.

  body: I&#39;d say absolute nothing is a 100% priority. Absolute anything doesn&#39;t
    even exist! So I totally agree that legibility and readability are simply factors
    in the balance of compromises that is Design. I for one have no problem making
    something intentionally hard to figure out - as long as you do it for a good reason.
    Not because you think breaking stuff is cool. <BR> <BR>That said, when it comes
    to something like a novel, I think the performance difference between sans and
    serif is actually quite large. <BR> <BR>hhp
