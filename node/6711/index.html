		<div class="commentbody">Patricia <BR> <BR>I have hand-set and printed both the Monotype Centaur and the Bembo. Is that what you are asking? I am not sure what characteristics you are looking for but in terms of their technical function, they did differ from other Monotype issues &#40;Monotype Centaur was a particularly weak face in this regard&#41;: <BR> <BR>While quite beautiful and desireable typeface designs, as a pressman I found them to be tragically flawed. The bar on the lowercase e is quite weak and erodes quickly with repeated impression. I always bought plenty of e sorts because of that. <BR> <BR>The digital versions however, hold up well when printed with the photopolymer plate process. This may be due to a change in the design &#40;none of the digital versions are exact replications of the metal&#41; but I suspect it is more simply the differing substructure characteristics of the two transfer materials, that is, that the polymer provides better relief support to the crossbar.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patricia, <BR> <BR>I also have used the two faces. Although I set the text on a Monotype.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks much for the great technical insight  Gerald L. and Gerald G. <BR>but there is still for me the doubt about the digital versions; <BR>-which characteristics or patterns define Dante? <BR> I read for example that Marderstieg&#39;s Griffo&#39;s &#34;source&#34; is Bembo; <BR>Dante has the spirit of Griffo&#39;s work, said Bringhurst, <BR>So that brings the two of them to the French Old Style,   <BR>then, which digital version is the best bet: <BR>Monotype Bembo or Monotype Dante? <BR> <BR>Patricia</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patricia <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always favored Dante over Bembo but to answer your question. The Bembo was an earlier digital issue and may very well have been based on the photofilm version of Bembo rather than the metal. The Dante however, which was a much later release,  was based on the metal patterns. At least that is what I recall. When Monotype Typography issued the digital Dante they put out a very nice prospectus detailing the production of it. At the time there were a number of reviews as well, including my own in _The Typographer_.  <BR> <BR>You might also look into Pastonchi. When Monotype released it they put out an amazing prospectus which included samples of Marderstieg&#39;s work with it. When Monotype Typography released the digital version &#40;I believe it was their last before they merged with Agfa&#41;, it was a direct replication of the metal. I had printed a book with the metal version and the day I finished I was sent a beta version of the Pastonchi release. I did the prospectus using the digital and printing it letterpress. Quite nearly right on. <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>
