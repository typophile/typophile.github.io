  body: 'I had to lift the images from the page to compare them side by side. Even
    though Besonio is very close, the S and R are not exactly the same shapes. I think
    Ed Gothic is still the answer, and here&#39;s how to make them closer &#40;I think&#41;:
    <BR> <BR>If a black outline stroke is added it would make the letters thinner
    looking against a black background, and then change the proportions by either
    squeezing, or vertically stretching the letters. <BR> <BR>If I had this font I
    would demonstrate, but perhaps Tiffany could try it &#40;please&#41;? Use the
    original R with Alt S and C.'

  body: Well, I finally heard back from the source of the sample and they said that
    its a custom font done by a local artist. I&#39;ll try to find out more but that&#39;s
    it, I guess. Everytime I&#39;m convinced something&#39;s familiar, it seems its
    the exact opposite. Thanks for all your help guys and gals!
