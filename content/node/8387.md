  body: The typical place to start is Robert Bringhurst&#39;s <i>The elements of typographic
    style.</i> This book is mainly concerned with typography &#40;i.e. design with
    type&#41;, particularly book typography, rather than type design &#40;design of
    type&#41;, but the type specimen section is quite good.

  body: Thank you so much everybody! <BR> <BR>John, I already Bringhurst&#39;s book.
    Its a grerat read. But like you said, the book is more for book typography. I&#39;m
    looking for something more on tye design. <BR> <BR>William, where can I find the
    book Letters of Credit <BR> <BR>Charles, thank you for you suggestion. I think
    it just might be the book I&#39;m looking for. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, I was told two
    books are good. One, Designing Typefaces and two, Typographically Speaking. The
    Art of Mathew Carter. What do you think? <BR> <BR>Navi

    <BR> <BR>Navi, you are asking the wrong person. I&#39;m not a rational book purchaser.
    If I want it I buy it, credit card be damned. If you have the money to invest
    in books, both of those which you have mentioned are worth adding to your typographic
    library. Ask yourself what your goals are, that is what I do. I used to buy design
    monographs, Graphis specifically, and now almost purposefully avoid those books
    focusing instead on history and books with good bibliographies. Design magazines
    at present offer plenty of &#34;year in review&#34; samplings of great design,
    no need to spend a fortune on a book for that. <BR> <BR>Designing Typefaces &#40;<a
    href="http://tinyurl.com/4c5xc" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/4c5xc</a>&#41;
    is, in my humble opinion, more useful for people serious about learning more about
    type design than is Typographically Speaking &#40;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/63jmf"
    target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/63jmf</a>&#41;. I consider Typo. Speak. to
    be more history than practical explanation. However, I have only looked through
    it a handful of times and have not read it. I have Designing Typefaces and that
    is from where my bias comes.'

    John, which derives from the Hebrew meaning &#39;Beloved of God&#39;, I would
    be quite concerned to consider the significance of the reverse of that sentiment.

    &#40;I think; my Proto-Dravidian is a little rusty.&#41; <BR> <BR>This phrase
    can be found in the Voynich Manuscript <i>and</i> the Easter Island tablets. Coincidence?
    I think not.

    it is to learn about the basics of designing type, the books are quite different
    from learning about the history of type, punchcutting and design. <BR> <BR>I have
    just finished an excellent book called &#39;TYPE the secret history of letters&#39;
