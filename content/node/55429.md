    Pure goodness. People here are just plain nice and helpful. \r\n"

    what you make of it. I use it as more of a mini-blog/professional networking.\r\n\r\nIf

    content created by said community."

  body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nThe term \"online community\" seems to have sparked some
    controversy. Let me specify that my research is centering around websites with
    user-generated content.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to determine why users are drawn to
    some of these sites over others? Think about the UGC websites that you contribute
    to, and why you have chosen those particular ones. What is it about those sites
    that is so conducive to a community feeling, that keeps users coming back and
    contributing?\r\n\r\nThanks for all the feedback, its really helpful so far!"

    community.\r\n\r\nEVERYONE wants to build a community web site. But only those
    that establish a community from the get-go get anywhere. As such it's a bit of
    a catch-22 and often, more than anything, a bit of luck.\r\n\r\nFacebook took
    off because it was developed in an incubator of a defined and attentive audience...Harvard
    students. \r\n\r\nTwitter took off because it's a service, not necessarily a content
    repository. It's the service that is successful moreso than any of the content.
    \r\n\r\nI'd hazard a guess that Typophile, like many narrow-topic discussion boards,
    was successful due to having a topic of interest that wasn't being addressed in
    any other forum or web site. "

    It takes a large commitment to do something like that, I know because I have done
    both. If a board like this gets spam-riddled or overly aggressive people start
    dominating, then it is probably not going to succeed.\r\n\r\nSo thanks to all
    the mods and admins here for allowing a very free flowing train of thought and
    heading off train wrecks (sometimes). :)\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nMy mind is subject

    lots of folks, but not too many for a community: hundreds who look at it regularly,
    daily.\r\n \r\n2. You have to love type with a passion to want to frequent it.
    Even people who disagree about everything else know they are among the rare birds
    who share their love of type. Which engenders a certain, um, pure goodness. \r\n
    \r\n3. People who work on type and with type are in front of computers all day--and
    sometimes night--quite a few don't have colleagues around to talk with about their
    work.\r\n\r\n4. The most experienced and knowledgeable people in the field and
    novices--and everyone in between--post regularly. The mix keeps things fresh,
    lively and informative. \r\n\r\n5. And thanks to Joe, Jared, Christian, the moderators,
    who made it and keep it functional.  \r\n\r\n   "

    depends on how one uses it. For some people it\u2019s a casual screwball chatroom.
    For others\u2014particularly writers with thousands or tens-of-thousands of followers\u2014it\u2019s
    turning into an incredible new search tool. I think that Twitter will be like
    Friendster and MySpace\u2014interesting, but a little too raw, and waiting to
    be replaced by the next generation of tech. "
