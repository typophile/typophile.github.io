  body: Looks like a condensed version of Serpentine with the serifs removed. The
    Image Club library offered a <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?nCo=AFMT&amp;pid=405988">sans
    version of Serpentine</a>, but it retained the same character dimensions and spacing
    of VGC&#39;s original Serpentine. <BR>
