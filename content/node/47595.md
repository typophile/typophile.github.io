  you might associate with the not so glorious type of The British Empire (British
  rule in the Indian subcontinent between 1858 and 1947).... or as my client refers
  to it as \"British Raj.\"  Something obviously serifed and / or scripted is the
  direction we are wanting to venture off in.\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with
  Dalliance, and although I do really like the outcome so far, I'd really like to
  find some other faces to play with.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/dalliance_script_ot/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/dalliance_roman_ot/\r\n\r\nAs
  always, suggestions / help is always much appreciated.\r\n\r\nOkay."

    plus Dalliance \u2026  and Oxtail came into my mind immediately http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/psyops/oxtail_set_ot/\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    all over the top, but who knows.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\n\r\nSome more of what comes
    into my mind right now \u2013\r\nGill Sans, Bookman Old Style, Caslon 540, Hoefler
    Text, Bell MT, Corona, Maple, Parry/Parry Grotesque, ok then Baskerville, Mrs.
    Eaves \u2013 this is a \"font cloud\" i would start with \u2026 no special order
    here"

    on this one, but I do like it!\r\n\r\nThe second font cloud, although a great
    collection of typefaces, might not work.  I'd love to find a few more Script faces
    to play with.\r\n\r\nSuggestions anyone?\r\n\r\nOkay.  \r\n"
