body: "It's been two years, but Valentype makes a thunderous come-back. If you know
  what it\u2019s like to passionately love a typeface, The FontFeed offers a golden
  opportunity. Declare your love for a typeface and you could win an official single
  license to four (4) weights/styles in OpenType, Offc or Webfont format of that typeface
  (for example Regular, Italic, Bold, Black). This love declaration can take any form
  you like: a poem, an image, a short text, whatever you feel like creating.\r\n\r\nPreviously
  limited to FontFont and OurType fonts, now more than thirty foundries participate
  in this year's type love extravaganza. Head over to <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/valentype-testify-and-win-the-typeface-you-love/\">The
  FontFeed</a> for all the details."
