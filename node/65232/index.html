  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">With the flood of Type IDs hitting this board on a regular basis, we've had an idea that we'd love to get your feedback on.

How would you feel if incoming Type IDs were pre-sorted into font classifications? 

Potential categories could be:

- SANS
- SERIF
- SCRIPT
- DISPLAY
- BLACKLETTER

Would this be helpful? More appealing? Overcomplicating things? Let us know.

Plus, I don't want to have to check five separate places to do IDs.

What I would like is the "Next Thread" and "Previous Thread" links back (lost in the previous redesign).

Also, maybe include some help text next to the "Title" field when creating new threads to help minimize the "ID THIS FONT PLEASE!!!" titles.

		<div class="commentbody">What Mark and Lex said. Categories won’t help (even a distinction of sans and serif seems to be too tough for some of our guests). They even would slow down things, as we then had to go through various index pages.

Better (= distinguishable, ideally descriptive) thread titles would be a real improvement. For the guidelines: There used to be a sticky post with <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/">FAQ</a> (which nobody actually read). They included this paragraph:

What do I enter in the “Title” line?
Try to define your type ID request as clearly as possible. For example <em>“1960’s newspaper headline face”</em> or <em>“Lost in Translation movie logo”</em> or <em>“retro script”</em> will do nicely. Whereas <em>“Please help me identify this font”</em> is pretty pointless as that’s the only thing we do on the Type Identification Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline would say <em>“Stuff happened!”</em>

I've always liked that «What do I enter in the “Title” line?» paragraph from the FAQ. About how to make more people actually read it, how about a «?» icon next to the Title field (when starting a new thread) that displays that sort of explanation text via a tooltip on hover?</div>

Something must be checked in order to post the thread. Also provide a place for letters/words from the font you want ID'd, which also must be filled in. Too many times we are not even sure which font they are trying to get ID'd.

For me, and I know this is probably asking too much, knowing the age and country of origin of the sample would be a great help.

Check boxes for catagories are a nice idea but should not be mandatory; if someone is not sure, you really don't want them to check a box willy-nilly in order to post.
