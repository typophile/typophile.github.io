body: "I've got a question for those doing or knowing book design...\r\n\r\nI noticed,
  that when I'm reading a book that I sometimes 'miss' the last word of a paragraph
  when it is alone on a single line at the and of the last paragraph. (Of course,
  this mostly happens when I'm a bit distracted or otherwise not fully concentrating
  on what I'm reading.)  I'm not talking about widows and orphans, rather something
  like this\r\n\r\n... (bottom of recto) ...\r\n   Slowly he slid toward the door,
  pressing him-\r\nself more and more into the wall, into the dark, \r\naway from
  his enemy. Would this door save his \r\nhide?\r\n[turn page to continue on next
  verso]\r\n... next paragraph...\r\n\r\nThus, I would visually skip or miss the word
  \"hide\", then turn the page to read on and think \"hey, there was something missing
  from that last sentence\" only to turn back the page and discover that I had missed
  the last line.\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\nIs this something that is so common that
  there is some term for it? (No, I don't mean ADS ;)\r\nIn case this is common, do
  some book designers take care about justifying paragraphs in a way that prevents
  this. E.g. making sure that there are a few more words on the last line of a paragraph
  when it ends on a recto so it has more visual weight and isn't missed by distracted
  dorks like myself?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    book typographers take care in avoiding that. Lesser designers can make that mistake,
    and it very much is an error to not adjust your way out of that situation."

  body: "Do you know whether applications such as InDesign or Quark can do this automatically
    (either as a build in feature or with 3rd party plugins)? It seems to be in the
    same similar complexity category as the widow/orphan control features that everybody
    supports. However, I have not seen this yet but I just might not have looked in
    the right places. Especially as I don't know the terminology for \"lone word at
    end of paragraph. <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/41152\">This thread
    here on Typophile</a> suggests that those loners may be called widows after all.
    Or \"runts\" or \"stragglers\".\r\nThe fact that I usually see them in cheap books
    could be a hint that most software can't handle those automatically. Or that the
    switch one has to turn on to handle them automatically is hidden away so that
    those cheap-book-peddlers can't afford to find it ;) "

  body: "In all my decades in book work, I have never heard it stated as a general
    rule that a single word in the last line of a paragraph is a bad thing. Not even
    in the last line of a page.\r\n\r\nWhen you do leave a single word on that last
    line, it is a good idea to make sure that single word is longer than the \xB6
    indent on the following line.\r\n\r\nI also try to avoid breaking the last word
    of any paragraph, so there will not be some kind of \"non-word\" on the last line.
    In well-designed and well-set books, the word \"hide\" in Lars's example would
    most likely be longer than the \xB6 indent.\r\n\r\nI might make an exception were
    I told by a publisher that a book I was designing/setting was to be aimed at an
    audience of people who were not highly skilled readers.\r\n\r\n& I've never been
    involved in the production of \"cheap books\" (unless you are making a value judgement
    about the content). In fact, I've set plenty of \xB6s like that in really expensive
    books. So that argument holds no water, at least when I'm in the room.\r\n\r\nIf
    people are missing words such as Lars's \"hide,\" they are reading too fast. Slow
    down, savor the text, get involved with it. You'll miss fewer words.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Thanks for sharing the insight. I agree, slowing down helps. It doesn't happen
    that often but I find it really interesting to hear about this from a book design
    perspective.\r\n\r\nIt may also be a question of reading technique. At work, I
    often have to read large amounts of text rather fast in order to get an overview
    of some material. And in order to do that I try to read words in clusters rather
    then single words. Thus, if there is no cluster for my eyes to latch on to, I
    may miss something. This is OK when doing the kind of scanning and skimming I
    talked about. \r\n\r\nWill, what you wrote reminds me that I need to actively
    remember to get out of that mode when I'm \"really\" reading.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nLars"
