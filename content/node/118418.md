  body: "For digital equivalents, looks like a mash-up of Kobalt (most of the letters)
    and Eagle Bold (C, S):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/kobalt/std-bold/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/\r\n\r\nIt's
    entirely possible that the original signmaker took his inspiration from older
    type samples (the original Eagle Bold was designed in 1933 by Morris Fuller Benton;
    Kobalt was created by Leslie Cabarga in 2007, but based on Art Deco typefaces
    from the same period as Eagle Bold)."

  body: "EDITED:\r\nI note that the Dom Polski Centre is located in Australia http://dompolski.com.au/our-centre-3\r\nWhat
    would a 1970s Australian designer use as inspiration for the _DOM POLSKI CENTRE_
    sign? \r\nSomething from Poland?\r\nSomething from Australia?\r\nOne, as already
    mentioned, would be Eagle Bold drawn in 1933 for the National Recovery Association.
    \r\nOthers could include  the 1930s designs of Alessandro Butti for Nebiolo. Few
    are digitized. Some letterforms that are echoed in _DOM POLSKI CENTRE_  are found
    in Semplicit\xE0. See Simplo http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo/  and

  body: "EDITED:\r\nIf this was something from Poland and it was  ever made into a
    font it is possible that it was by a Polish fontmaker.\r\nPerhaps it is worth
    digging through the links at Luc Devroye's Polish Font Scene page http://luc.devroye.org/poland.html\r\nLongshot.\r\nDon\r\n"
