  body: "Looks like it could be an inline version of Blippo by Robert Trogman. Either
    that or Letraset's Pump. The geometry of the inline in your sample matches that
    of Trogman's other face, Yagi double, which leads me to think it's probably based
    on Blippo rather than Pump. There are several digital incarnations of Blippo around,
    but I've not previously seen or heard of an inline version. This may have been
    done as a custom job.\r\n\r\n"
