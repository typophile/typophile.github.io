body: I&#39;m sure there is a thread on this, so if someone can point me in the right
  direction I&#39;ll willingly go. <BR> <BR>I have fonts &#40;both Postscript and
  TrueType&#41; from the &#34;old days - Sys. 9.2.2&#41;.  I can&#39;t figure out
  how to get them to work on my 10.3.8 Mac.  Double clicking on some cause the &#34;Preview&#34;
  software to launch with an empty file.  Unstuffing does&#39;t. Changing the name
  to .&#40;dot&#41; LWFN or FFIL or anything else so far doesn&#39;t work.  I&#39;m
  lost and I need Algerian for a project today. <BR>Help? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.

    you just open Fontbook and install them?

  body: Nah, Fontbook and Suitcase don&#39;t recognize the files as font files.  That
    is why I tried adding a suffix like LWFN.  The font in question this time &#40;Algerian&#41;
    has is Postscript.  It has a scr and datafork file.  The .scr has 48k the other
    has zero k size.  Surely there is a way to use these fonts on the &#34;NEW&#34;
    OS?? <BR> <BR>Thanks.

    <BR> <BR>I got the fonts by copying them to my memory stick from the G3 and copying
    from memory stick to the G4.  This works perfectly with the ttf fonts, but not
    the PS.  Remember, the PS fonts are divided into SCR and Printer which OSX doesn&#39;t
    use the same way as OS9. <BR> <BR>The fonts work perfectly on os 9.2.2'

  body: It doesn&#39;t &#34;use them the same way&#34; in the sense that its rendering
    is different &#40;for all font formats&#41;, but OS X will generally recognize
    valid Type 1 fonts from OS 9 just fine. You might want to read Apple&#39;s white
    paper on fonts in OS X to see if clearing your font cache or something will help.
    <BR> <BR>There is absolutely no need to turn your pre-existing TrueType fonts
    into dfonts to make them work on OS X, either. I have no idea where somebody got
    that idea. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T <BR> <BR>Thomas Phinney <BR>Program Manager

  body: 'Just a hunch, Neil. If you&#39;re using a &#34;memory stick&#34; to copy
    the fonts, it&#39;s possible that the suitcase file is losing its resources on
    the way. Many USB memory sticks &#40;or whatever they may call them&#41; are formated
    using a PC disk format that does not recognize the resource fork in a Mac file.
    Not all Mac files contain resource forks, but Mac font suitcases do, and it&#39;s
    where all the font data is stored. <BR> <BR>A simple way to tell if this is in
    fact what&#39;s going on would be to stuff the fonts before transfering them with
    the memory stick and unstuffing them on the other Mac. <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    Fontbook doesn&#39;t recognize PostScript fonts directly. It sees them only via
    a suitcase &#40;screenfont&#41; file. To install them, double-click on the suitecase
    file or drag it onto the FontBook icon. Ironically, OSX will generally not let
    you see the screen fonts stored in the suitcase file but uses the linked PostScript
    fonts for screen display instead. However, all the style, metrics and kerning
    information is stored in the suitcase file. PostScript font files by themselves
    cannot be installed and nothing will happen if you try to open them in FontBook.
    <BR> <BR>One more thing:  <BR> <BR>Font suitcases no longer have an icon that
    looks like a suitcase. Instead, look for the letters FFIL on the icon. &#34;Font
    Suitcase&#34; will also be shown as &#34;Kind&#34; in the Finder. <BR> <BR>PostScript
    font files have the letters LWFN on their icons and are listed as &#34;PostScript
    Type 1 Outline Font&#34; under &#34;Kind&#34; in the Finder.'

  body: H B M, Classic knows nothing of dfonts.  <BR> <BR>dfonts are required by low-level
    Unix stuff in OSX. Standard Mac TrueType fonts are stored in the resource fork
    of a font suitcase file. The low-level Unix stuff in OSX doesn&#39;t support resource
    forks in files, so the dfont format was created to get around this. <BR> <BR>dfonts
    are not needed per se once OSX is up and running and any standard format &#40;Mac
    or Windows TrueType, PostScript Type 1, OpenType&#41; will work fine.

  body: I don&#39;t know the answer to that.  <BR> <BR>Personally, I have found FontBook
    to be sufficient for my own purposes and less trouble than the more full-featured
    font managers that I have tried to use with OSX &#40;Font Reserve 3 and Suitcase
    X&#41;. If you use Classic a lot, be sure to check the preferences in FontBook
    and select &#34;Installing fonts makes them available for Classic Mac OS.&#34;
    I also use the option to have FontBook copy rather than move fonts when installing
    them. <BR> <BR>If I had to continually activate and deactivate fonts in my work
    or needed auto-activation, FontBook probably wouldn&#39;t be a good choice.

  body: Neil, most files will transfer well with a PC formated memory stick, except
    for fonts. I don&#39;t know why. <BR> <BR>I had the same problem some time ago.
    One way is stuffing the fonts. <BR> <BR>If you will only use the memory stick
    to transfer files between macs, format it for mac, that way you will resolve many
    problems and reduce the confusion of files starting with &#40;.&#41; <BR> <BR>If
    you will use both mac and PC then your only option is to stuff the font files.

    GraphicConverter instead of FontBook&#41;.  <BR>When that happens you can restore
    this to &#34;normal&#34; behaviour by using Get Info on one of those pesky files
    and poining Open with to FontBook and checking Change all...
