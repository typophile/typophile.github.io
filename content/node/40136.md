  i work for.\r\nI'm not sure about the license though.\r\nDoes anybody know if I
  can use it? Or how to get the authorization?\r\nAnd if it's possible to use it,
  is it also possible to find a version for PC?\r\nThanks!!"

    I think you can use it for a website.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is [[http://www.screen.co.jp/ga_product/sento/sample/hirg.html|a
    PC version]] of it, but I\u2019m afraid they doesn\u2019t ship it outside Japan.\r\n\r\nAnyway
    you should ask them.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you might purchase it [[http://font.multi-bits.com/ds/execute/FontSearch?encoding=Shift_JIS&locale=ja&tick=1197889825155&node=1197891692526&createOrder=false&searchType=1&orderBy=id&desc=false&knownTotal=0&offset=0&simString=&category=02&maker=4605&weight=0&type=01&platform=0&keyword=&simulation=0&saleType=1|here]]
