body: "Basic question:  Is text on a curved path considered a major \"type crime\"?\r\nPerhaps
  it's just an issue on a font like Futura Extra Bold... see the attached pic for
  an example.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aawposter_6114.jpg]\r\n\r\nSpecifically
  regarding the large \"Art-a-Whirl\" in the upper left.  For example, the baselines
  of the 'A' and 'r' are at different angles. Do graphic designers hang in hell for
  these kinds of problems?\r\n\r\nI'm open to any other comments regarding colors/layout/whatever.\r\nKeep
  in mind this poster is far from done... yes, I'm well aware of the major kerning
  issues :)\r\n\r\nFWIW, the instructor and other students seem to like the \"curved\"
  version, but since it's not a type class they may not know any better.\r\n\r\nPDF,

    problem is exacerbated by wider typefaces and characters, if it is bothering you
    maybe you should try something a bit narrower or with more verticals.\r\nTim"

  body: "Notice that Peignot used a condensed typeface and generous spacing, both
    of which minimize the baseline angle problem.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to use
    a curved envelope, so you get a curved baseline (and cap line). The drawback is
    that the distortion this causes to the letters is often more noticeable, not to
    mention ugly."

  body: When I do curved type, I convert everything to outlines and adjust the shapes
    of the letters to fit the curve better, but as subtle as possible so it's not
    obvious. The goal should be to make it less noticeable than without the corrections.
    Wide letters are the most difficult.

    Christian? Do you guys remember it?\r\n\r\nI'd agree with what has been said.
    Sometimes type on a curve can be an elegant solution for spice to an otherwise
    bland design. On the other hand, sometimes it is just one more spice which isn't
    needed. It is about moderation."
