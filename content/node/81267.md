  an issue from Paratype (same one?). Neither has old-style figures or small caps,
  even the \"Pro.\"\r\n\r\nBack when we were using the Linotron 202, there was a supplemental
  font that had the os figs, both italic and roman, and small caps in roman.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of a foundry that has issued Pilgrim (or Bunyan) that includes these?"
