    rules but hit a snag. I went to the Flickr page but the 3rd image was not downloadable.
    I had to refresh the page a couple of times to find one that was. I picked the
    third one from that page even though the first image was far better for the random
    subject chosen by Wikipedia. The other problem is that this is a color photo.
    Do I change it to greyscale or leave it exactly as I found it?\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    opinion. I've seen research that indicates the more absurd or ridiculous the name,
    the more effective it is for the band (and the record company too).\r\n\r\nCurrently
    there is a fashion for abstract and incongruous band names, many of which are
    \"found\" names, found on the internet in much the same manner as we are doing
    now. The random approach. Dada and surrealists of course practically invented
    the idea of incongruity in serious art, or at least they are credited with championing
    it.\r\n\r\nOne time about fifteen years ago I came up with a good name for a band
    but it was too far ahead of the time -- <em>Carpet</em>. I offered it to half
    a dozen bands here in Melbourne and not one of them was game enuff to take it.
    Musicians---they think they're so radical and avant garde. I've worked on PR for

    this overlooked 1971 release, tenor saxophonist Jim Wright delivers his characteristic
    suave technique. Wright's renditions of jazz standards are bent and stretched
    almost beyond recognition on some tracks, but his hypnotic solos and drummer Morris
    Benton's wont to play with meter are tied down by Claude Arrighi's reassuring
    bass. One of the trio's best efforts.\"\r\n\r\noriginal photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/localsurfer/2184034624/\r\n\r\n(A

    journey to the bottom of the martini glass has a special resonance in light of
