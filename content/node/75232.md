  body: "ITC Tiepolo font is from the design team at AlphaOmega Typography and named
    after Italian artist Dominic Tiepolo. The designers describe it as a \"sans serif
    with serifs\" and it has also been referred to as a calligraphic design. Similar
    to Asian calligraphy, ITC Tiepolo font has personality yet does not detract from
    the text.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/Detail.htm?ProductId=153573\r\n\r\n
