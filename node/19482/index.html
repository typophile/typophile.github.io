  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am interested in the origins of [[grotesque]] typefaces in nineteenth-century [[Germany]].</p>
<p>In my opinion, the relevance of the Grotesk typology in the context of the birth and early development of the [[sans serif|sanserif]] has perhaps been underestimated by a historiographic tradition focused on Anglo-American achievements. Some indications:</p>
<p>– Most sources agree that [[William Thorowgood]] released the first sanserif lowercase in 1834. Nevertheless, it seems that the [[Scheltzer and Giesecke|Schelter &amp; Giesecke]] foundry (Leipzig) had produced a light sans serif with both capitals and lower case letters by 1825. (Source: Lawson, Anatomy of a Typeface, p. 297). I find this doubtful, but if proven, this face would be not only prior to Thorowgood´s (and even [[Figgins]]') but far more sophisticated.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/thorow.gif" alt="">
Thorowgood 1834</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/schlanke.gif" alt="">
Schelter&amp;Giesecke 1825</p>
<p>– The Grotesk typefaces were used in the nineteenth century for setting [[body text]] (namely in scientific and technical publications), long before the american [[gothic|gothics]] left display and jobbing as their exclusive tasks. (Source: <a href="http://www.typolexikon.de/g/grotesk.html">http://www.typolexikon.de/g/grotesk.html</a>)</p>
<p>– Looking at specimens from late nineteenth century, one finds a very remarkable level (for the time) of  formal development, and perhaps even a tendency towards systematization and coordination of [[weight|weights]] and sizes. (Source: Schelter&amp;Giesecke specimen, c.1898)</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/schelter05.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Any argument or contribution is more than welcome. I´d like also to pose these questions to the forum:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When did the first Grotesk appear in Germany?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which typeface would be the first in including a lowercase in that country (if the Lawson statement is erroneous)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did the sanserif started to be used as a text face there?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very  much,</p>
<p>Xurxo</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The collection of samples (the S&amp;G and Thorowgood sanserifs together) suggests to me that images and data were taken from P.M. Handover&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Grotesque Letters&rdquo; (in Monotype News Letter 69, March 1963). There however, the &ldquo;1825&rdquo; reads &ldquo;? ca 1825&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
<p>To date this Schelter &amp; Giesecke sanserif, called &ldquo;Schlanke Grotesk&rdquo;, back to 1825 is a mistake. Unfortunately, subsequent writer just copied this from Mrs Handhover. So much for writing history of type.
As you already noted, it is so perfect that it cannot be from such an early date. It can be found in part one of the &ldquo;Muster-Sammlung&rdquo;, of 1886. But it should be hard to trace this back earlier for type specimens weren&rsquo;t dated back then.
(Side note: In the S&amp;G specimen books you find other sanserif of much lower quality, more like the early British ones. These were &ndash; I bet &ndash; produced earlier than the fine &ldquo;Schlanke Grotesk&rdquo; which you showed, but later than the early British ones.)</p>

<p>One would have to compare type in dated magazines with type in foundry specimens.
Send in the Type Scene Investigators!</p>
<p>I say magazines, because that is the kind of printing where sans serifs were mainly used, although the German scientific tradition of using sans faces would be worth exploring, in scientific publications.</p>

<p>But then: There is the &ldquo;Handbuch der Schriftarten&rdquo; (1926-) which shows typefaces of different foundries &ndash; by similarity. With this in mind, I wonder if <em>only</em> searching magazines would suffice to decide whether a typeface appearing in a magazine is grotesk a from foundry A or grotesk b from foundry B, because they were almost identical.
That discussion today is centered around Akzidenz Grotesk so much, with some Schelter &amp; Giesecke Breite Grotesk here and there (but only because of the revival which serves as a reminder), is a bit funny if we take into account that at its time, AG was but one among many, all of them very similar to each other. Even to experts' eyes. Similarly, almost every German foundry hat a Breite Grotesk, some better, some worse.</p>

<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t really matter.
The purpose is to date a genre of type.
Here is an ad from the London <em>Punch</em> magazine, 1843 (incidentally, also the best-selling humour magazine in Canada and the United States at the time).
I have not seen these sans faces in the Figgins, or Caslon &amp; Livermore specimens of the day. 
Perhaps they are in some specimen books I am not aware of.
Or perhaps they are types that never appeared in specimen books.
Or perhaps they are types from specimen books of which no copies now exist.
Or perhaps they are types from foundries that have vanished without trace.
Type history is a little too dependent on foundry specimens &ndash; from the usual suspects.

<p>For sure, Nick.</p>
<p>Anyone knows if there is any virtual gallery on nineteenth century German publications? The only gallery of this kind I know –pointed out to me by Eduardo Manso from [[Emtype Foundry]]– covers exclusively nineteenth-century USA (by the way: worth visiting, specially the reproductions of The Century magazine, printed by De Vinne. <a href="http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/moa_search.html">http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/moa_search.html</a>)</p>

<p>I think so. The matter is to widen our knowledge of the sanserif genre´s first steps, by learning more on the history of the Grotesk –which seems to have answers to questions such as e.g. when a sanserif was first used as a text face.</p>

<p>Not that hard. The &lsquo;Schlanke Grotesk&rsquo; dates from 1882.</p>
<p>In the 1870s and 18880s, Schelter &amp; Giesecke published their own journal &lsquo;Typographische Mitteilungen&rsquo; (typographic reports), in which they presented their new typefaces. This journal was published approximately every few months.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;Typographische Mitteilungen&rsquo;, 2. Band, 3. Heft, published in May 1882, on page 2 the &lsquo;Schlanke Grotesk&rsquo; is presented as a new design:</p>
<p>&lsquo;In our last issue, we presented the Enge Antiqua, and we said that this typeface allowed extreme tight setting. Today we are able to present an in-house cut Schlanke Grotesk , which enables the type setter to set even more compressed without losing legibility. This typeface will prove its usefullness not only for job printing but also for the setting of advertisments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(This is my translation from German.)</p>
<p>(St Bride Printing Library in London has a copy of Typographische 
Mitteilungen', 2. Band, 3. Heft, May 1882)</p>

<p>I fear there are no <em>serious</em> publications about it. For some time I tried to find something, but most of the articles present second-hand stuff themselves. Repeating myths.
Sad because the issue is most fascinating: Like, before the Johnson and Gill sanserifs, British sanserifs (the groteques) had many features in common with the German ones. I always wondered if German sanserifs had their origin in Britain.
But this is speculation. Unfortunately. Glad about any correction.</p>

No.
I have heard these rumours that sans serif was used in nineteenth-century German scientific publications - does anyone know from which source this information comes from? - but bearing in mind that back then a substantial part of the newspapers and books was printed in Fraktur (blackletter) I find it hard to believe that sans serif was used for longer texts. If it was actually used, then I would rather assume that it might have been used for some special purposes. But this is only speculation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It just came to my mind, that some ten years before Caslon&rsquo;s Egyptian, the first sans serif tyeface (with upper case only), there was already a Greek unseriffed typeface (uppercase only):
Edward Daniel Clarke&rsquo;s Greek type (1805). You can find Justin Howes&rsquo;s article about this typeface in the Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Typography and Visual Communication in June 2002 in Thessaloniki, Greece. John Bowman (in his book &lsquo;Greek printing types in Britain&rsquo;) also mentions this typeface, and he calls it &lsquo;Cambridge Small Pica Sarcophagus&rsquo;. (Nice name for a typeface!)</p>
<p>If anyone has information about sans serif in nineteenth-century German scientific publications - now is the time to tell us more about it&hellip;</p>

<p>The source I know of –pointed out by Andreas Seidel at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/4567">http://typophile.com/node/4567</a>, 5th post– is the typolexikon.de website, run by Wolfgang Beinert from Berlin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;[in the XIX century] the Grotesk was used predominantly for jobbing and in scientific and technical publications&rdquo; (my approximated translation from German) 
&ldquo;die Grotesk dann überwiegend im * Akzidenzsatz sowie in wissenschaftlichen und technischen Publikationen verwendet.&rdquo;
<a href="http://www.typolexikon.de/g/grotesk.html">http://www.typolexikon.de/g/grotesk.html</a></p>
<p>In this other section, Beinert states that Theinhardt&rsquo;s Royal Grotesk was designed for the publications of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences.
&ldquo;Theinhardt entwarf um 1880 für die wissenschaftlichen Publikationen der » Königlich-Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin « die » Royal-Grotesk « in vier Schnitten.&rdquo;

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And when did lowercase first appear on a Grotesk?</p>
<p>The crudeness you point out seems to be a clear feature of all early sanserifs, first originated –as said– in Britain and then the US. The genre got refined afterwards through the century. I got the impression (not proven) that by the last third of the century, the Grotesks had achieved a substantially greater level of development than their Anglo-American counterparts. I wonder how the Grotesks were in the beginning (if just as primitive or if they presented early clues to that future refinement), and what was the pace of their formal growth.</p>
<p>Another gap in the history of Grotesks seems to be right in the birth date. What is the oldest specimen of a German sanserif anyone at the forum knows of?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear, as you said, that some aspects of those Grotesks <cite>have not fully evolved</cite> (namely the optical unbalance of some characters). Their full evolution would only come with neogrotesques, like Univers.</p>
<p>I was trying to point out the fact that neogrotesques are (roughly said) but optically polished and systematized Grotesks.</p>
<p>The basic formal appeals of neogrotesques (say <cite>what makes them beatiful</cite>), –e.g. their stark and robust simplicity, a kind of plain but precise synthetization–<cite> are already there </cite>in the German grotesques of the preceding century.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Optical polish&rdquo; is even tone, but there is nothing inherently beautiful about this quality. Many would consider the polishing excessive, resulting in a smooth but dull finish.
The condensed Grotesks were just as systematized as the condensed neoGrotesques &ndash; only with an evenness of stroke thickness, not overall tone.</p>
<p>I certainly agree that the Neogrotesques are direct revivals of 19th century faces &ndash; compare the type in the ad I showed earlier with Helvetica:</p>

I fully agree with you (the slight misunderstanding was perhaps here). Explaining it with other words: the only thing neogrotesques added was even tone, but apart from that particular new feature (which is a logical evolution, but as you said can be praised for its cleanness or disliked for its homogenization) they are <cite>just as </cite>beatiful as the grotesques from a century ago.</p>
<p>The formal findings (the effective originalities in form, compared to other genres, that give character and appeal to a typology) are all in the beginning, in vernacular grotesques.</p>
<p>Your more than adequate sample tells all this at just a glance.</p>
<p><cite>The condensed Grotesks were just as systematized as the condensed neoGrotesques</cite>
For systematization I was rather referring to the fact that a typical neogrotesque is designed from the outset as an array of coordinated weights –it&rsquo;s conceived as a program or system (being this another new feature).</p>
<p><cite>What I really want to see (and discover when) is the first Regular weight lower case sans faces.</cite>
We open this request to anyone at the forum, as done in previous posts. What&rsquo;s the earliest example of a lowercase Grotesk anyone knows of?</p>
