  body: "The capital letters in the text \"USE 1000 TIMES\u2026\" is probably Gravur
    but the main product nameplate is not Gravur. There seems to be at least 3 different
    fonts on this package.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the lowercase \"e\" in the nameplate.
    Or even the lowercase \"c\". Neither match the font Gravur.\r\n\r\nI've no idea
    what the font in the nameplate actually is, though. Sorry."
