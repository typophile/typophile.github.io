  body: But you would have to write <strong>Lo</strong> Spirito Moderno to be even
    <em>more</em> authoritative (and in correct Italian, to boot).

  body: 'Looking at the booklet of David''s typefaces that they passed out last summer
    at Typecon, I see that this used to be called ''Old Modern''. In its previous
    incarnation, its lower case terminals were more ball terminals on the roman. In
    this new version he''s taken the sort of swashed ''yin-yang'' shape that he had
    on the italic, and put that on the roman too. That adds a stylish panache to the
    authority of the previous face, which I think makes it really attractive. I''m
    sure he''s done other stuff as well, but that''s what I first notice. '
