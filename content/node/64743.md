  body: "Can you tell us anything about the origin of the sample? How old is it, and
    where is it from? It looks somewhat similar to some Art Nouveau-era scripts and
    lettering, but my books do not show it, as far as I have found. \r\n\r\nIt's possible
    (maybe likely) that the original embossing plate was made from hand lettering.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "thanks mike, i'm not sure of the origin apart from its danish writing, \r\nits
    embossed into card on the reverse of a photograph thats teh only info i have.\r\nyeah
    i'm feeling nouveau also with that odense and n\xF8rregade typography.\r\nThe
    two \"r\"s on n\xF8rregade look exactly the same, so thats what had me thinking
    it was a face rather than completely handmade.\r\n\r\n"
