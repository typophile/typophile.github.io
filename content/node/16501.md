  \r\nIt was organised for the 2nd Panhellenic Conference \r\non Sexual Abuse. The
  theme was: \r\n\"No Longer a Secret: Dealing with Sexual Abuse \r\nand the Way towards
  Healthy Sexuality\". \r\n\r\nThe competition is over (no, I didn't win) \r\nand
  so now I can show my proposals. \r\n\r\nAny comments? (I already know that I overused
  the heart symbol...) \r\n\r\n"

    of love. The compositions and treatments are nice, but I think your concept needs
    reconsidering, think more about violence, victim and oppressor.\r\nTim"

  body: I agree with timd, your layouts are great! but I don't think that they solved
    the problem as well as they could have and that's what we're out to do, no? solve
    problems through visuals. Good effort though!

  body: "I think Tim and David are right. I messed with love... \r\n\r\nActually I
    wanted to say: \r\n\"Love is a beutifull thing which can be a hell when we abuse
    it.\".\r\n\r\nWe may start from pure love, but then we lose the way \r\n(we don't
    have a way to express it or we express it violently) \r\nit can become monsterous.

  body: "Tim, David, don't take this the wrong way, but I think you're being too Anglo.
    I think it's wonderful to counter sexual abuse with a positive option instead
    of with melodrama or a large stick. In fact note that the title of the competition
    included \"the Way towards Healthy Sexuality\" - that got my attention most. And
    you would never see that in the US. I think this is nicely Greek, and the approach
    that could actually work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
