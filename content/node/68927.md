  right-align (in brochures, websites etc) is unconventional, but not incorrect.\r\nIs
  the situation similar (but reversed) in Hebrew, or is left-align actually incorrect.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
  in a web form, placing the labels to the right of the form fields would be unusual,
  but acceptable. What's the situation in Hebrew?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSteve\r\n"
