  several characters whose heights are lower than the rest (u,y,v,x) Is there a way
  to set the font to adjust these so they are uniform with the rest of the text? It
  is quite a long document so adjusting each character individually is not practical.\r\n\r\nThank
  you"

  body: How are you determining that the characters are "lower". In all fonts (properly
    constructed, that is) characters with rounded elements, like c, o, e, etc. will
    rise higher at the x-height than the characters you mention, in order to appear
    visually correct. Mathematically identical heights are the error, not the correction.

    Verlag is the right typeface for a long document?"

    than a printout? Also, what would be the downside of using verlag for a long document?
    Its not a book, just about 8 pages.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "<cite>why would a pdf be different than a printout?</cite>\r\n\r\nBecause
    rendering of typefaces on screen is bound to the physical resolution of monitors
    (among other things). So the difference in heights you\u2019re noticing could
    well be a rendering problem."
