  like 3 or 4 years actually, i've already talked to my graphist friends and no one
  could help me... The font i'm looking for is used almost everywhere, and it's principal
  use is album covers. Like Kylie Minogue's \"Body Language\", Every Cassius Albums...
  here are two links where you can see them:\r\nKylie: [[http://www.dvduruguay.com/dvd/placas/2453zz.jpg]]\r\nCassius:
  [[http://www.trip-hop.net/images/jacquettes/big/711.jpg]]\r\nAnd even kylie's Sister
  Dannii (much more clear): [[http://img464.imageshack.us/img464/8848/dannii0aq.jpg]]\r\n\r\nThank

    kerning, etc. He designed Avant Garde, but I can't say if there are alternates
    available, eg. the \"A\".\r\n\r\n"

    the alternative Avant Garde letters there. But meanwhile, for you to see them,
    Fontshop has been selling the individual weights and alternative fonts for years.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/avant_garde_gothic_alternate_ot/\r\n\r\nYes,
    including the A."
