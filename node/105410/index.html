  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I’m hoping someone can point me in the direction of some syntax examples for implementing language-specific ligatures.  I’m not completely clueless, but I’ve yet to find anything that’s entirely clear to me either.

<strong>The reason:</strong> I’ve been looking at some [[http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html|free fonts]] which look promising, but they implement some ligatures that are only appropriate in French (ae -> æ, oe -> œ).  Seeing words like <em>dœs</em> and <em>shœs</em> (or <em>Gæilge</em>) is a little disconcerting.  I’d like to corral these, though I suppose I could also just delete them.

The problem table seems to be this...

<pre>
feature rlig { # Required Ligatures
 # Latin
    sub A E by AE;
    sub A e by AE;
    sub O E by OE;
    sub O e by OE;
    sub a e by ae;
    sub o e by oe;
 script DFLT;
    sub A E by AE;
    sub A e by AE;
    sub O E by OE;
    sub O e by OE;
    sub a e by ae;
    sub o e by oe;
} rlig;
</pre>

By looking at other fonts it seems that I would need to define languages somewhere by script, but it’s not clear where you would do that (<em>ccmp</em> table?).</div>

But as Michel points out, not every occurrence of ae and oe in French is equivalent to æ and œ. These are not glyph display distinctions, they are spelling distinctions, and hence properly made at the character encoding level, not the GSUB level.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, the joy of opposing timezones.

I did find what I was looking for late yesterday ([[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html|Adobe: OpenType Feature File Specification]]).

My quick solution was to move this stuff to the end of <em>liga</em> in their own block...
<pre>
 language FRA; # French
lookup liga10 {
    sub A E by AE;
    sub A e by AE;
    sub O E by OE;
    sub O e by OE;
    sub a e by ae;
    sub o e by oe;
} liga10;
</pre>

...but it did seem unlikely to me that this was the usual thing to do for French, so removing it altogether is probably the best solution.

<blockquote>May apply to some other scripts.</blockquote>

Well it certainly seems to apply to text marked up as English and Irish in Webkit and on my Nook!

<blockquote>Use the "locl" feature.
There have been a number of threads at Typophile about the “ﬁ” ligature in Turkish, which might help you understand the issue and method.</blockquote>

I don’t think <em>locl</em> is appropriate here, but it would certainly be easy to allow for Turkish while I’m editing the <em>liga</em> feature.  These fonts already have fi & ffi in a separate block to fl, ffl & ff so it should be simply a matter of putting in something like...
<pre>
 language TRK  exclude_dflt; # Turkish
lookup liga1; # fl ffl ff
</pre>
...before...
<pre>
 script dflt;
lookup liga0; # fi ffi
lookup liga1; # fl ffl ff
</pre>
</pre>

That is a good point...you wouldn’t use them for Turkish of course.  On the other hand, since these are fonts that can be freely modified I don’t see how it causes any <em>problems</em> to nudge them in the general direction of Turkish compatibility.  In fact, if some other font was providing the missing fallback characters it could still make things a <em>little</em> less confusing.

Whatever the practical implications, it has resulting in my learning a little syntax, so it was worthwhile for me!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>… and in the <strong>free</strong> book The Hound of the Baskervalds the dog is missing.</cite>

What a silly thing to say. 

Changing the topic from <cite>books</cite> to <cite>type,</cite> in the <strong>for money</strong> fonts, say, oh, from Adobe, there aren't any combining diacriticals there, either. Show me an Adobe font that has all -- or even some -- of the characters from 0300 to 036F. Less sure about the fonts from the Monotype conglomeration, but I'd bet it is similar. And include FontFont.

I don't know about DTL. Wonderfully drawn fonts. I wish my customers (the 100 or so publishers in the Association of American University Presses) could afford them. I'm not being snide, I really would like to work with these fonts, as I think they would print (ink on paper) so much better than most of what is used. But I argue in vain, the annual font budget for most presses isn't large enough to buy even one DTL family. And designers have their quirks too, many would rather save up & buy the new display font of the year...

Try offering an educational discount to, say, the University of Chicago Press. I'll broker the deal for free just to have the privilege of working with DTL fonts.

Given my customers can't afford DTL fonts my question is moot, but just out of curiosity, how many of them have populated the combining diacritics? How many languages can you cover? Romanized Arabic? Romanized Indic Scripts? The major (non-European) languages used in Africa? Native American languages, where "American" covers North, Central and South America?

It isn't just the little, unimportant people of those countries involved. Western Europe is full of ex-colonial powers, and as they run out of topics such as how many petticoats George Sand might have worn, had she worn petticoats, they turn to the history of those colonial days...

Actually, it is in the OpenSource fonts where attention is paid to combining diacriticals and support is given to the languages that require them.

Remember, the Unicode Consortium said <cite>Gosh darn it golly gee whiz</cite> (or words to that effect), <cite>we're not going to keep assigning codepoints for accented Latin glyphs. The proper way to render such glyphs is to use a base character and a (or series of) combining diacritical(s).</cite> Which makes perfect sense. If you go read the section on combining diacritics in the Unicode Standard, everything is provided for. Now if only the font publishers would comply...</div>

Thank you for the compliment regarding DTL fonts and your offer to recommend them at the American University Presses. Actually we feel perfectly happy with our niche market and the subsequent exclusivity of our fonts (or vice versa).

Ah, yes, I believe I've head about such places... "What ever the gentleman desires and can afford can be provided." I hope in these days of gender equality the same is offered to women?
