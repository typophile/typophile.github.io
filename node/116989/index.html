<p>I have attached a logo which was designed in the early 1990&rsquo;s for my employer, an engineering firm specializing in control and system integration.  It is still used, with some variations, in print  materials.  A different logo/look was created in the early 2000&rsquo;s for use on the company&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.primarysys.com">www.primarysys.com</a>.  I recently came on-board as a one-man marketing department, and have inherited all of these different looks.  I&rsquo;d like to develop (or re-use) a logo which will work in both print and on-line, in 1 color as well as 2 or 3 color.</p>
<p>I think I have identified 2 of the 3 fonts used.  The “psi” appears to be monotype corsiva bold, which was then made bold again.  (or, as Mike Yanega of Bowfin Printworks pointed out to me, it might have been made bolder using stroke thickness).  The “system engineers” is myriad pro bold italic with a tracking (extension) of about 133%.  I’m about 90% sure of these results, but could very well be wrong – I’m not  a designer, I’m a marketing person!</p>
<p>For the life of me, I cannot identify the font used for “Primary Systems Inc.” – it’s obviously a san serif type, with an unusual “Y” with uneven arms, and variable thickness in the type.  I certainly don’t have it on Adobe Illustrator and haven’t been able to find anything like it on-line.</p>
<p>So 2 questions.  Can anyone identify the font for Primary Systems Inc.? and does this logo work for an engineering firm?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All letters of &ldquo;PRIMARY SYSTEMS INC&rdquo; except /Y seems to come from <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=URW&amp;ffam=Castle%20T%20Light%20-%20Regular&amp;fid=c6c2b9cad904e2bce35a61754ece6ed6&amp;fsize=60&amp;text=PRIMARY%20SYSTEMS%20INC&amp;fit=1|Castle Light]]</strong> by  Steve Jackaman (available from URW++, E&amp;F, Linotype)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually the right person to say if this is appropriate for a engineering firm&hellip; but the overall feeling is like it&rsquo;s designed from the engineers themselves and not from a graphic artist.</p>
<p>=&gt; &ldquo;psi&rdquo; dot is out of balance
=&gt; The high contrast (line thickness variance) between the &ldquo;psi&rdquo; and &ldquo;PRIMARY SYSTEMS INC&rdquo; makes it inappropriate for small scale sizes
=&gt; The Blue/Gray transition on the lower band is totally optically unbalanced relative to the &ldquo;System Engineers&rdquo; words</p>
<p>and take into account that I&rsquo;m just a computer programmer&hellip; 
I&rsquo;m sure that a trained graphic artist eye will discover even more flaws.</p>
<p>Having done the same mistake myself, my advice is to hire a professional graphic designer to re-design your logo (probably by keeping some basic elements or colors, if you want to keep a connection to the old one).</p>
