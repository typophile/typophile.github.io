  create my characters and then cut/paste them into FontLab.  Works, however...\r\n\r\nFor
  instance, on the letter 'l' (like a script l), the widths of my bowl (terminology?)
  at the left and right are not equal.  They are in Illustrator (checked and double
  checked).  It's a modern script so we're not talking any form of curves here.\r\n\r\nI
  don't know if this is some quirk with cut/paste, FontLab or what?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks..."

    Illustrator to draw typefaces</a>\r\n\r\nMaybe it has something to do with this:\r\n<em>If
    you observe some distortions in the shape of the imported object, make sure that
    it is not related to the integer coordinates. Generally, digital fonts (PostScript,
    TrueType or OpenType) can only include integer coordinates. On the other hand,
    your Illustrator artwork can have nodes with non-integer coordinates such as 161.352
    pt or 354.78 mm. When FontLab imports a drawing, it has to round them to integer
    values \u2014 because it cannot generate fonts with non-integer coordinates.</em>

  body: I would say that the best way of drawing letters is to make them in FL. I
    work with Illustrator since the first version (Illustrator 88, over 15 years)
    and it's a wonderfull drawing software to create lots of things like illustration,
    graphs, charts, and so on, but FL has an advance over Illustrator to create typeface.

  body: "I agree, but FontLab is such a rich application I simply can't find some
    things.  Like, is there a way to snap to grid?  Also, unfortunately I'm in a rush
    just to get something rolling...so I have to fall back to old habits to make them
    happen.\r\n\r\nMike's...ummm...advice was very helpful. ;)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm
    totally addicted to this already and I'm not sure why I never ventured down these
    waters earlier (having been a graphic designer for 10 years).  Guess I never had
    an excuse to try..."
