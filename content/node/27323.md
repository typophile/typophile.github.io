  body: "Minion Pro--it was re-drawn and is better than Minion--is a champion of usability
    among text faces. In a previous discussion of Minion, Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez
    pointed out that Slimbach intended it as a replacement for Times New Roman--it
    being an extremely compact, economical type. It also has a huge range of styles
    and weights and four optical sizes, making it wonderfully adaptable to different
    projects. \r\n\r\nIt has many, many vitues. However, to my eyes it has two shortcomings.
    First, it is a bit too compact and tightly spaced for ideal readability. Second,
    there is something about the roman that lacks liveliness and charm. Times New
    Roman remains better in that respect.  "

  body: I dislike Minion; in particular, the narrow lower bowl of g, the coyly off-horizontal
    bar on e and the a irritate me. It's aiming at a particularly generic sort of
    humanist grace, but its unrelieved compression makes it feel claustrophobic.

  body: "Paul Stanley commented on Minion a while ago, and I'll never forget this
    brilliant little bit of typovangelism:\r\n\r\n\"I don't want anyone to think that
    I disparage Minion; I can see its virtues, but I cannot love them. I guess it's
    a matter of taste. Minion seems to me slightly mannered, perhaps too polished,
    its elegance too studied. When it comes to tea, it spreads its napkin carefully,
    drops no crumbs, eats its cake with a fork and holds its cup ever-so-daintily.
    It avoids talking about sex, religion or politics. It leaves when it should and
    writes its thank-you note that evening. One's mother says, \"When are you having
    that nice Minion over, such a charming boy.\" I prefer something a little rougher,
    quirkier, more dangerous.\r\n\r\nAnd because it's such a pleasant guest, one does
    see it around a lot. Better, no doubt and by far, than some of the others one
    sees all the time. But unlikely to thrill.\"\r\n\r\nMy suggestion, if I may make
    one in such learned company here on typophile? Go for Sabon Next (a real beauty),
    or Bembo Book (as in the new digitization); perhaps Dante, or if you don't mind
    the lack of variety, Dolly by Underware. The possibilities are legion. I'd even
    be so bold as to suggest Luminance by Mac Rhino. If you're looking for something
    a bit more modern, try Josh Dardens' Freight (serif) family.\r\n\r\nAs far as
    Aldus goes, it is a lovely, elegant face. The current digitzation is very usable. "

    If you are going to be bored looking at a typeface while you are using it, then
    it will be a particulary unrewarding experiencce. No need to be to much of a typographic

  body: "Minion is popping up in quite a few places. Right now I'm watching it being
    used in some of the end titles on the movie \"Shrek II\" on HBO West.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    Minion Pro is redrawn better, I still have some practical use for the previous
    Multiple Master version in sign making.\r\n\r\nNeon filled channel letters are
    very popular for signage these days. But any letter with a serif is a big pain
    to make unless the letter can be set very large. If the letters are less than
    2' tall I try to avoid serif styles completely. A good 2\" of clearance is required
    for the neon tubes, housings, etc. Many book faces at 24\" will have narrow portions
    far under that 2\" minimum. The optical size and weight axis sliders with MinionMM
    could yield a slab serif letter more practical to make at modest sizes. And by
    \"modest\" I mean 2' tall.\r\n\r\nI hate it with a passion when customers want
    a channel letter sign with serif type in sizes like 12\". I have to keep the fabricators
    in our big shop from wringing my neck."

  body: "<code>Who needs thrill from a book face, the book designer or the reader?</code>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a good point. In my [limited] experience, we typographers and type fanatics sometimes
    make a lot of fuss about things that really don't affect the vast majority of
    readers (or should I say \"users\"?), even unconsciously. Of course a better way
    to ascertain that would be so set the same page in, say, Minion and Bembo, and
    conduct a usability test.\r\n\r\nI personally am not very fond of Times New Roman,
    but have read books as large and dense as <a href=\"http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780195079937\"
    target=\"_blank\"><em>The world's writing systems</em></a> without being bored
    or apparently having my comprehension hindered -- or my appreciation diminished
    -- by the text set in TNR. That's not to say that a typographer's careful selection
    of a typeface is a futile effort, but sometimes the microscopic nuances we fret
    about may not make such a big difference to the end user. (Notice I said \"may\"!)\r\n\r\nSure,
    the nuances I mentioned may be a typographer's <em>raison d'\xEAtre</em>, but
    as Zapf puts it, \"typographic design is sometimes misconstrued as a form of private
    self-expression for designers\".\r\n\r\nBack to Minion, I personally find it an
    excellent, extremely versatile typeface that does extraordinarily well the job
    of \"disappearing\" so that the text can take centre stage."

    purposes -- see page 52 & 53 of the first edition. And of course, as has been
    noted, it is a very proper face, so as an original, well-mannered old style face,
    with a large character set, it would be many people's first choice for a book
    like this.

    use, but it's still a great typeface. \r\n\r\nAs I said, Minion is a champion
    of usability and adaptability. It really beats out other type faces in many situations,
    and deserves the good things said about it in this thread. But something about

    other Slimbach faces, such as Adobe Garamond, which is fabulous--though not as
