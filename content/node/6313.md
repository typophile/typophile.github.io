body: "\xABTry that font!\xBB, \xABTry this one, look, it&#39;s really nice\xBB, \xABThis
  is great for you job, use it!\xBB &amp; so on. I guess, everybody has heard those
  motivating exclamations many times. So, you go to the site of a typefoudnry, click
  the font, look at it, maybe it&#39;s good, maybe not so \u2014 you would test it
  anyway. The only way to do this nowadays is to \xABTest drive\xBB it on the screen
  with the resolution of poor 72dpi, sometimes with some &#34;nice&#34; background
  interfering the specimen completely. And this is not really a test-drive. It&#39;s
  a tease drive. So if I like it, but am not sure, I will have to pay some 30$ to
  get a copy of it and put it back on the shelf after I&#39;ve seen that it looks
  a bit different when printed with that laser printer in the corner. It is of no
  interest anymore. Cool. -30$. The loop starts again. <BR> <BR>The good thing is
  \u2014 type foundries get there fonts sold, type designers get royalties, websites
  get even more banners placed and earn some peanuts too. <BR> <BR>The bad thing is
  \u2014 some frustrated designers get eDonkey installed, search for any font, download
  it and never buy it again. Nobody gets any royalties, hot discussions about piracy
  and type being seen as an easy concept to abuse spring out there and there. <BR>
  <BR>In Easter Europe &#40;my motherland belongs to that corner&#41;, you just go
  around the corner, pay 3$ for a CD and get 50 000 fonts packed and sorted nicely.
  From 20 different foundries. Full character sets. True Type or PostScript. Whatever.
  Who will pay 30$ for ONE font now? And let me assure you, out of those 50000 you
  were looking maybe for those three... <BR> <BR>I am probably opening some smelly
  box now and give yet another push to the old topic, but I just want to ask, if anybody
  has any ideas about ways of testing the fonts live. There are practices in this
  highly commercialized world to try things for free and not to upset anybody \u2014
  be it a customer or a business. It&#39;s like a test drive at your local car dealer.
  You do have the chance to drive your beloved BMW, maybe even for a whole weekend.
  For free, of course. You just tank it. Ha, nice. Let me see, what SAAB got there.
  Hm. And Rover? Oh.. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve read somewhere, that a [small] type foundry
  was selling its font&#40;s&#41; for a 10$ with a time-limited license or something.
  Am not sure. My idea is to sell for peanuts &#40;$1&#41; or let out for free a font
  containing limited characters, couple of figures, maybe even OS and Caps in the
  same file. So you can type in some words, see some chars, print them out&#40;!&#41;
  and get the feeling. So you go and buy it then. I would. Even though I have 3 CD
  full of fonts from my motherland. Good for me, I can test-drive fonts with full
  character sets. But I don&#39;t use any of them unlicensed \u2014 I always buy fonts
  for my later work. Bad for the industry \u2014 several thousands of other designers
  do the same and will never think of licensing a single font. There is no other way
  to try a font and the temptation to \xABleave it like that\xBB is just way too big.
  <BR> <BR>P.S. The first paragraph has nothing to do with the other thread I have
  started couple of hours ago &#40;where I do ask about a specific font&#41;. I didn&#39;t
  mean to pick on anybody here."

  body: 'This is an excellent idea. It is also a very tricky idea, because, as we
    know from music and dvd&#39;s, any encription can be broken. <BR> <BR>So, if a
    foundry were to release a 30-day trial version of a font, soon enough someone
    would find a way to break the time lock, and people would be using the font for
    free, easier. <BR> <BR>Of course, everyone already uses all of the fonts for free,
    the bootleg CD Alexy has just mentioned. <BR> <BR>Foundries are often reluctant
    to increase the possibility that even more people will be using their fonts without
    buying. This is really a life and death issue for our industry. <BR> <BR>FontShop
    just tried out an idea that I like: they released the Semi-Bold weight of Legato
    for free. If you like that, you can buy more weights, or the whole family. When
    you have a family with two dozen or more weights, one single weight is usually
    not of much use &#40;esp. Semi Bold&#41;, but together'

  body: 'I come from the world of free software, which struggles mightily with similar
    issues. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure that font foundries, as an <i>industry</i>,
    have much of a future. I know this may not be a popular position here, but I&#39;m
    not entirely sure this is a bad thing. <BR> <BR>My ideal world would reward font
    designers for their work, and also allow people to use the resulting fonts freely.
    The successes of free software prove that these two goals are not always incompatible.
    In addition, while there&#39;s a lot of crappy free software out there, there&#39;s
    also some really high quality work being done. <BR> <BR>In fact, my paying job
    strikes a pretty good balance between all these goals. I&#39;m the chief ghost
    of Ghostscript, which is released both as free software, and is also licensed
    to about a hundred OEM customers, bringing in enough revenue to support a staff
    of about ten engineers. <BR> <BR>So the basic formula is that <i>people</i> can
    use our software for free &#40;and millions do&#41;, but companies that want to
    sell something including our software have to pay. We do get ripped off from time
    to time, but on balance it works pretty well. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t really know
    how to adapt this formula to fonts, but I am suggesting that there might be better
    models than trying to enforce intellectual property protection. <BR> <BR>I see
    three big problems with the free font scene: low quality &#40;in general; absolutely
    no offense meant to the nice freely released fonts I see posted here&#41;, lack
    of scholarship and attribution, and ripoff artists grabbing more attention than
    the people who actually do the work. The attribution thing is pretty central to
    the philosophy of free software, which after all has its roots in academic computer
    science. It&#39;s also not just a problem with freeware fonts - &#34;Book Antiqua&#34;,
    anyone? <BR> <BR>Again, I don&#39;t have solutions for these problems. I&#39;m
    much more likely to design fonts as a hobby than as a profession, but it&#39;s
    always nice to get recognition for your work, and there are few forms of recognition
    more satisfying than payment. <BR> <BR>[And sorry for the rambling - I&#39;m up
    way past my bedtime. If I&#39;ve started a big flamewar, hopefully I&#39;ll be
    coherent in the morning]'

  body: There&#39;s a lot of people whe pay for typefaces, Often they work in &#39;professional&#39;
    agencies who have a software licensing policy. <BR>Here in the UK, organisations
    like FAST investigate companies, and although the fines for illegal software aren&#39;t
    crippling, &#40;neither are they for companies that pollute the environment&#41;,
    there ARE fines. <BR>So, people do buy type software, and I think there are enough
    of them for the industry to continue to exist.

  body: Oh, to make that last post seem more on topic, <BR>these agencies have no
    problem with $30 for one weight to test the font, then hopefully they buy a multi
    user licence for the family for the whole of their organisation.
