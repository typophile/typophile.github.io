body: "Requesting some advice on matching Egyptian typefaces with sans serifs. The
  project in question is a newspaper, and the sans serif used is H&FJ's Knockout.
  The Egyptian typeface will be the third typeface in the paper's type family. My
  question is, how close to the sans serif characters should the Egyptian characters
  be? I've seen pubications where the cut of the Egyptian is completely different
  from that of the sans serif, and others (such as Esquire) who's Egyptian-SansSerif
  relationship is dead on (Stag and Stag Sans)...\r\n\r\nI've included a link to  two
  options I'm currently thinking about (Knockout with Soho and Knockout with Serifa).
  My initial feeling is that Serifa has more of the Knockout \"feel,\" but individually,
  I like Soho MUCH better (plus, it has more weights than Serifa).\r\n\r\nThoughts???\r\n\r\nhttp://img382.imageshack.us/img382/2549/serifspecimeniw5.jpg"

  body: The reason Serifa works better with Knockout is because it has a similar old-school
    stroke contrast. Soho has a very contemporary, almost monolinear stroke. I think
    Serifa is a much better fit. How many weights do you really need? Try setting
    a few headlines and pages with Serifa and see if it does the job. You might also
    consider Frutiger's other slab <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/glypha_std_complete_vp/">Glypha</a>
    which is essentially the same design but more condensed with a larger x-height.

  body: "I don't suppose\u2014given your preference for Soho\u2014that you could sub
    in another sans serif for Knockout? Seb Lester just released his newest type family:
    Soho Gothic, a deliciously contemporary sans serif companion for Soho. Actually,
    I like it personally much more than Soho itself, and given a choice between the
    two, would choose it."

  body: thanks, Stephen - I think Glypha is a better fit - especially since the headlines
    are in a more condensed Knockout. Am planning to use the slab font for pages headers/graphical
    elements.
