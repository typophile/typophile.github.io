  and talent, and enjoy it a lot, really. Yet, when opening fontlab, I get bored so
  easily. I find difficult to exactly match the style along the glyphs, and after
  some efforts I give up. The result is often an ugly and ill-matched set of glyphs
  I'd be ashamed to show someone. Crap.\r\nDo you have any suggestion on how to approach
  digital font design in an easy way?\r\n\r\nthank you very much\r\nm."

    mistake in saying "funny" when you meant "fun". I blame our crazy language, not
    you. Carry on.

    is dull, grueling, boring and repetitive. If you ever hope to make a decent font,
    I would suggest that you get a new attitude."

  body: ">I find difficult to exactly match the style along the glyphs, \r\n\r\nIt
    sounds like you are biting off more than you can chew.\r\n\r\nTry doing a design
    with a very simple structure, where glyphs are constructed from a small group
    of basic elements which are copied and pasted. Most simple: a sans serif \"techno\"
    font, somewhat condensed, where many characters have a common width. (There is
    still room for subtleties such as variation of stroke width between horizontal
    and vertical, and between caps and lower case.)\r\n\r\nConcentrate on getting
    this to look good in words, by working on the widths of the sidebearings as part
    of the design process.\r\n\r\nIf you can tolerate this procedure, and produce
    a font you are not ashamed of, there's hope for you yet. "

    and I thought I could start off with a very easy task: a Garamond-like font. :)\r\nYes,
    I know, I could have chosen a Blackletter with ornaments, but you know... \r\n\r\nStephen,
    \r\nyou did fine! Sorry but English comes quite 'unnatural' to my mindset. I prefer
    French :)\r\n"

    that doesn't mean you have to completely give up; but you do have to find somebody
    (or some font house) to help you out. Note that Eric Gill's status as a type designer
    is taken for granted, but he didn't do any of the spacing!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Massimo,\r\n\r\nI don't think it's an attitude thing that you're facing here
    but the quality of the FontLab interface. (I only know 4.6, not the 5.0)  A good
    interface doesn't make one a better designer but it sure helps enjoying the process
    if you enjoy the process you'll get better at what you do since you'll do it more
    often. Maybe that's what bugs you.\r\n\r\nTo your recent question, you'd be surprised
    what type producers would do for money :)\r\nYour sketches are automatically protected
    by copyright law I'd think. Does anyone differ?\r\n"

    differ with yourself. A legally enforceable copyright requires legal documentation,
    and legally enforcing the copyright requires a lawyer (unless you're the music
    industry, in which case it requires congressmen in your pocket). Unscrupulous
    people are rarely bothered by niceties, or even legalities, if it's up to the
    copyright holder to enforce his or her rights."

  body: "Massimo, since I'm still a type designer in diapers (a novice type designer)
    I understand your frustrations. It sounds to me like you're just starting out.
    Once your computer drawing skills start to catch up with your mind, things will
    go a lot quicker. There are of course still going to be some tedious moments,
    but after awhile you'll get the hang of it. It just takes practice, practice,
    practice. I'm on my 3rd or 4th type redraw right now and still have yet to produce
    a result that I'm completely happy with.\r\n\r\nGive it time. I'm much faster
    now, and know where to move and what to do to make improvements. I had to f*ck
    up many times before it came easier. "

  body: It could also be that you design the letters and then allow the foundry to
    flesh it out. I do know, for instance, some foundries do accept designs and then
    do the technical work themselves.

    to be an idea man who never completed anything, now I like to take one idea to

    adhere to the rules of drawing type traditionally (calligraphic/humanist \u2026

    have the passion to draw type you will learn. Try drawing the type from a print
    out \u2013 print out Garamond at a large point size and draw it down in pencil
    \u2013 you'll remeber the flow of the forms better than pasting beziers straight
