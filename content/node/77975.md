body: "This is my first slab serif ever done (or tried). The aim was to make something
  like mixture of geometrical flows and strong, stable shapes and to make a more modern
  look of usually sharp shaped slab serifs.\r\n\r\nSo far, I'm thinking about making
  also Italic for this one and probably that would be the whole family, even I tried
  to make something like Regular and Light versions of this \"Bold\" that you see,
  but so far, I'm not so sure about doing that.\r\n\r\nI didn't showed numbers 6 and
  9, cause I'm not pretty satisfied how thay are looking currently.\r\nNo spacing
  and kerning applied in this samples.\r\n\r\nAny constructive comments are welcomed!\r\n\r\n*
  I updated PDF.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Saxophone_preview_5394.jpg]"
