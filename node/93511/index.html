  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey everyone, I'm new to this awesome forum. I was wondering if I could get some of you experts in typography to help give some input on my poster series. I'm creating posters that deal with typography and some basic tips for beginners. Right now I have 8 posters and will maybe make a ninth if I need it. I was hoping that everyone could give me some input on the topics I chose to write about.

1. Choose the right typeface for the job.
2. Serif or Sans Serif?
3. Kern correctly.
4. Use two fonts on average in a design.
5. The grid.
6. Weights.
7. Hierarchy.
8. Use fonts that have complete sets of glyphs.

So those were the topics I chose to put. I'm going for a real minimalist poster and  I already have some examples if you would want to see them.

Thanks everyone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A question: What is the intended purpose of this poster series?  You say that it's a series of tips, but your example isn't a tip - it's a 'what you should be thinking about'/

If it were the opening slide of an extended power-point presentation, fine. But if it's a stand-alone reminder, I don't think that your example really says very much. 

It's as if your topic were 'getting ready to face the day' and a  poster said:
 Choose your clothing appropriate to your day

The content  is dull, and neither gives any hint of why or  how, and has little educational or entertainment value. For this topic in particular, why is the typeface you chose appropriate for the poster? Maybe the same phrase in two different typefaces, one next to or over the other, might bring the point across. Possibly an almost illegible display font as a contrast.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the reply, it all helps! I understand completely what you're saying. The only thing is that I would say that since my poster is telling you to think about your choice of typeface, it would be a tip.

Anyway, your suggestion about using illegible typefaces to show contrast is really good, the only thing I would have to say is that in the format it's at right now, adding things like that seems to me as if they would add unwanted noise to the design. So, would you suggest, to scrap the layout of these posters and redesign it? Or should I try to incorporate it into the design?

Lastly, I'll try to get a kerning example that's another one of my posters.

Edit

So I finished the next example. Anyway I think this one has a more interesting concept since it shows a bad example of kerning and then some text that is kerned much better.

Sorry again for the image width....
