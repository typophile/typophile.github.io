  font]]. In original version should'nt be with the \"grunge effect\". Seems similar
  to EF Microgramma, but it's not the same. Anyone could help out with the name of
  typeface?\r\n\r\nThanx in advance!"

    the URL hasn't the little differences (like the shorter stroke of the t)."

  body: "Maybe, but the Microgramma have more like circle-like form. This one is quite
    quadratic shaped.\r\n\r\nHere's an example what I mean - these glyphs is streched
    but have a little different shape. Anyway, not sure about this case.\r\n\r\nhttp://i40.tinypic.com/244xg76.png"
