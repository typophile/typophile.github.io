  it for a project, but can't find a digital version. Only a non-outline version called
  \"Lucifer\" have been digitalised. Not sure why it's called that. Was there never
  a Pluto Regular?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DanXSolo-PlutoOutline_4077.png]\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nPookey"

    good and clean job. Looking for a lowercase for you.
