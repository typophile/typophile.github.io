body: In InDesign if I set up a character style for small caps which kerns +25, what
  is the best way to avoid a larger space (due to the +25 kern) appearing after the
  end of a word set in small caps? How do you guys deal with this? It's sort of time
  consuming to go through and change the kerning for each instance...

  body: 'In InDesign CS3 I don''t believe there is any way to automate this with character
    styles, and I don''t think CS4 would offer any solutions either. If you''re concerned
    about adjacent punctuation (parentheses and the like) being asymmetrical, and
    if your font doesn''t have those pesky small caps versions of these, you can just
    include the punctuation in the small caps style. If your font has small caps versions
    of these and you wish not to use them, I do believe your stuck making the manual
    adjustments. '

  body: I'm sort of surprised there isn't an easier way to solve this problem. Adobe
    is so good at offering finely tuned typographic control and this seems like an
    annoying problem almost every designer will face again and again. It must drive
    book designers insane...

  body: For all the great features of InDesign, there are also many missing ones.
    For example, the one mentioned in [[http://typophile.com/node/50379|this thread]],
    the ability to specify quantities as ems rather than fixed units, relational values
    (for example, making a paragraph indent equal to 2xleading rather than a fixed
    value), control over optical margin alignment, etc., etc. I guess they gradually
    roll out features so that people will keep upgrading.
