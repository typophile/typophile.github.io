  body: "Bodoni Open, slightly stretched?\r\nhttp://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=PF00001201P2\r\n\r\nEdit:
    it's not an exact match (the A and the M are different), and the more I look at
    the sample the more I agree it may have been a hand-job - the peak of the A extends
    up way too far. Unless you absolutely need to match this sample I think you'd
    do better to use an existing font like Bodoni Open."

  body: "I digitized that a few years ago for some design group or other, I can't
    remember who.\r\n\r\nAs the original artwork had been lost long ago, I was given
    a clothing tag which was so degraded, it looked like a 20th generation photocopy.
    I had to interpret this into something sharp. From this I made an upper case typeface
    with the logo built-in as 2 keystrokes.\r\n\r\nI know the peak of the A extends
    up way too far, I couldn't see the logic of it myself, but the client knows best.
    So it wasn't a 'hand job' after all.\r\n\r\nBTW - Hi Diederik, how you doin'\r\n\r\nNick
