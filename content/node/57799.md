body: "Downturn was most directly inspired by letters painted on the wall of an old
  medical warehouse in Washington, D.C.. Other inspirations include lettering on manhole
  covers, metal signs and machinery in New York and DC.\r\n\r\nIts quirky letterforms
  and deliberately uneven color reflect the typographic naivet\xE9 of signpainters
  and engineers more interested in impact than consistency. (That\u2019s not a general
  dig at signpainters, just the typographically naive ones).\r\n\r\nChunky, in-your-face
  letters make Downturn appropriate for posters, packaging, headlines and other places
  you need a big impact.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dunwich/downturn/\">Downturn
  is available for licensing at MyFonts\u2014$25 per weight, $90 for the family.</a>
  Web embedding licenses will be available at a later date.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://dunwichtype.com/pdfs/Downturn_Specimen.pdf\">Click

  body: "<cite>I like it, only I think the small caps are a little to small. ;)</cite>\r\n\r\nThey
    actually are a little on the short side. That\u2019s because Downturn is spaced
    <em>very</em> tightly on the assumption that it will primarily be used at larger
    sizes. The tight spacing made the small caps clash with the caps in too many places,
    so they had to come down a little."
