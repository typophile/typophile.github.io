body: "add a \"preview\"-button for the \"action\"-commands, well, especially for
  the metrics-part. so that it would automatically change the things you see in \"Preview\".\r\n\r\nit
  would help making it easier for me as a beginner because i often have to do it a
  few times before its right (for a working spacing, not for the endproduct)."

  body: "What I like to see in FontLab is that when I select a few glyphs, Fontlab
    will print the selected glyphs in a size I like. Fontlab has 'print sample', but
    than I have to type in the names from the glyphs I like to print. When I like
    to see, let say 50 alt glyphs it's a lot of typing.\r\n\r\nPieter"

    / New Metrics Window, and then File / Print. \r\n\r\nA."
