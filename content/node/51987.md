  about a series of books for a university press (is that right?).\r\n\r\nThe covers
  of the books were really simple but so lovely. They had beautiful color combinations.
  I think they were set in Centaur... I think.\r\n\r\nDo you recall them? Who did
  them? What was the series name?\r\n\r\nThis is very abstract... I know.\r\n\r\nThese
  covers looked something like this, but better of course!!! :\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nicetitle_4213.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nicetitle2_4210.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nicetitle3_5310.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nicetitle4_3907.png]\r\n\r\nMikey
