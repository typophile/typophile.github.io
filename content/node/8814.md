  body: thanks for redirecting my question to this forum,,,I have checked the Hoeffler
    site before and they have a &#34;champion&#34; however it is not the Francois  Boltano
    type,,,,as a layman I am amazed at the lack of info on this designer,,,,this type
    being in my minds eye ,,,incredibly attractive!!!

  body: 'I have a sample of Boltana&#39;s &#39;Champion&#39; in the Script Font ID
    Guide. The reason there is so little about him is that he died young, apparently.
    I don&#39;t think the typeface was ever digitized commercially. [edited by moderator]

    target="_blank">link that shows the works of French type designers</a>. It was
    the source of the original graphic above. <BR> <BR>This was originally linked
    from one of Luc Devrouye&#39;s pages about French Type, but the links were changed.

    in 1973. &#40;It&#39;s incorrectly attributed to Robert Hunter Middleton on that
    page, unfortunately.&#41;

  body: Well, that crude to propose any pirated version of an design made only as
    exclusive by the designer who died few years ago, defintely too young. I don&#39;t
    like to see used the term &#34;reviving&#34; when its mostly piracy. Forgive me
    Mike but its nothing against your good intention to help. <BR> <BR>Champion received
    in 1989 the Morisawa Gold prize... <BR> <BR>Today, I&#39;m pretty sure that &#60;href&#62;Adobe
    Bickham Script&#60;/a&#62;  is a good remplacement, specially the recent OpenType
    version.

  body: I understand Jean &#40;and Yves I see the edit you made&#41;. I am sorry if
    that was an offensive thing to do. The font I showed is not making money for anyone
    else, and I did not point to where I found it, and as far as I could find there
    was no available version of Francois Boltana&#39;s font. Do you know of one? <BR>
    <BR>In the past, when we found a digitized version of a font that was not offered
    commercially we have shared information about it, so I thought I was not promoting
    a pirated version. <BR> <BR>I can see this is a &#39;gray&#39; area, and I accept
    your opinion that in this case, the design is too recent to be &#39;revived&#39;.

  body: No problem Mike. This was a <i>very</i> gray area case, so I conferred  <BR>with
    JFP about it and decided to remove the rip-off. Now if only  <BR>somebody decided
    to release the font, everybody&#39;d be happy. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Well, another way to look at this is that trying to stamp out the <BR>existing
    fonts leaves nobody happy. To say that doing so does <BR>honor to Francois Boltana
    is open to argument. I dare say that <BR>most of us, were we Boltana now and able
    to look from our <BR>resting place, would MUCH rather see two lovingly made fonts
    <BR>that make available the exquisite Champion to be seen and <BR>used than to
    have our typeface tied up in some copyright limbo <BR>or, worse, the copyright
    holder seeing it as not worth digitizing <BR>and having no intent to release a
    font. Saying otherwise takes <BR>a certain measure of arrogance, in my opinion.
    <BR> <BR>If anyone knows who owns the rights to Champion, please <BR>speak up
    so that I might write and urge the creation and <BR>release of a nice, better
    made, truly legitimate font that would, <BR>indeed, make everyone happy. <BR><br>

  body: Aha, thank you for that perspective, Jean. <BR> <BR>An interesting situation
    where a commercial foundry <BR>might be open to litigation, but a freeware font
    creator <BR>is but a shadow to a spurned widow. Well, the creator <BR>of the unnamed
    fonts duo was far from an amateur; <BR>it&#39;s almost as if a pro was familiar
    with this situation ... <BR> <BR>In any case, my hope that the nefarious freebie
    survive <BR>is only strenghtened &#40;for the sake of the beautiful script <BR>and
    the designer&#41;. I will, however, quit being a thorn in <BR>Yves&#39; side about
    his decision here. <BR><br>

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> As I said, this is a <i>very</i> gray area case,  <BR>so
    I take full responsibility for removing samples, names and links <BR>of the suspected
    rip-off. When in doubt, I&#39;d rather play it safe. <BR> <BR>That being said,
    I&#39;d like to go on record that I respect and appreciate  <BR>your view on the
    freeware/shareware community. We may agree  <BR>more often than you imagine. I
    also feel your opinions ensure that  <BR>the debate stays open and interesting.
    It&#39;s just that I have to police  <BR>this place, so I need to be strict.

    we may agree more often than <BR>you imagine. We simply draw the line in the sand
    at a very <BR>different spot. I&#39;ve been trying to be quiet and helpful only;
    <BR>as much as my inner voice allows, anyway. Cheers.
