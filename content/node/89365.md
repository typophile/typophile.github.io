body: "Hi,\r\nI got a problem with mask to master command in my MM font.\r\nI designed
  MM font with 4 axis, but i want to copy all the outliness from second axis to fourth
  axis - how can i do that?\r\n\r\nIhave studied Multiple Master chapter, but i don't
  really understand how can i copy outliness from second axis to fourth axis. I realized
  that probably i could do it by using a \"mask to master\" but it doasn't work\r\n\r\nI
  attached some image.\r\n\r\nI need this becouse i decided to start design \"optical
  size\" from the beginning.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Careful: don't confuse axes and masters. You designed a font with 2 axes
    and 4 masters.\r\n\r\nI would do Generate Instance to generate the second master
    as a separate font temporarily. Then use the Assign Master command to get it into
    the MM font again. Assign Master is more reliable than Blend Fonts or Mask to
    Master."

  body: "Thanks man,\r\nI did it, but this operation distorted some of my glyphs.\r\n\r\nSome
    of my glyphs need to manicure in black weight. \r\n\r\nAnyway i decided to do
    it on 1 axe and 2 masters only -> weight\r\nI need you to show me the way how
    can i do it, how can i change some of my black glyphs without using \"optical
    size\" axes which i did befor.\r\n\r\nPlease check attached GIF, you will notice
    what i'm talking about.\r\n\r\nThin, light, normal, medium and bold weight are
    with incomplete circle inside ;etter \"a\", but the black version i want to be
    like in my avatar -> with complete circle inside \"a\"."
