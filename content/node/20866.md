body: "I kinda had to make a choice between Typecon and MacWorld. I had already commited
  to meeting some people in SF in January, so that wins out this year.\r\n\r\nI will
  be switching to Mac around that time, plus I haven't had the chance to photograph
  SF since I got a camera. So I will fly up, and rent a car.\r\n\r\nI already have
  one long-time friend who will be meeting me there to bang around. Rumor has it I
  may get to meet a couple or more type illuminaries too...\r\n\r\nI probably have
  room for 1-2 more people who might be interested in going around the city looking
  for photo opportunities. Registered Typophile members will have priority. Frequent
  posters have even more. No regard for political persuasion, but everyone will have
  to pretend I am always right. Just kidding. Even though I am, even my friends still
  give me a hard time.\r\n; )\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on going and are interested,
  let me know and we will firm it up as it gets closer. \r\n\r\nI'll do Typecon next
  year, I guess. I vote for San Diego. (with a photo trip to Tijuana?)"

  body: "The first link didn't work, but the second guy is much younger, so I don't
    know what to think.\r\n: )\r\n\r\nI didn't know about Boston when I told two people
    I am meeting them in SF. But next year I will definitely plan on Typecon in '07
    because I saw several classes that sounded interesting to me. Not to mention there
    are some real characters here that I'll bet are fun to hang with.\r\n\r\nI just
    hope I don't get the bug for making fonts. I don't have the time, for starters."
