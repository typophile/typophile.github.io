<div class=commentbody>No evidence. It was just a shot in the dark. For all I know, Twombly does the same thing. I just don't have any Slimbach fonts lying around to take an *educated* guess, that's all. <br> <br>For what it's worth, I usually delete kerns below 7 that are a result of interpolation. 7, 8, and 9 get rounded up to 10. I'm adamantly multiples-of-5 when it comes to kerning, for slightly arbitrary reasons, but also because it often makes a search/replace much faster.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Slighty" arbitrary, because it's multiples of 5. But also not arbitrary, because it forces a decision. It limits my choices (not really, but I like to think so), and was easy to tap out in the Fontographer metrics window (Command-Option-something). <br> <br>I only look for interpolated results that are below 10, those are the only ones I change. The rest can exist happily in their multiple-of-17 status if they must. Oh, and the search/replace happens in BBEdit, when I change a sidebearing or something. I don't know, it's been a while, now that I'm on FontLab and that is no longer an issue. <br> <br>I'm forever off-topic. <br> <br>Alan</div>

<div class=commentbody>Karen, Slimbach rarely says anything in public, and in my 5+ years on discussion groups I haven't seen a single piece of participation from him. So any "documentation" about this is going to be second-hand, but also through observation. If I'm not mistaken David Lemon (on maybe it was JFP) has pointed out that Slimbach doesn't use trapping, but if you just look at his work, it's obvious anyway. <br> <br>His reasons are probably the same as for any accomplished type designer who doesn't put trapping: <br>1) Even if he thinks it helps a little bit, it's not cost-effective: the gain is too small compared to the effort. <br>2) In large sizes trapping (generally) looks ugly. <br>3) There's no methodical way of putting in traps, and that's a Modernist/Western turn-off. <br> <br>I can't argue with #1 too much - it's a personal balance of craftsmanship versus delivery of goods. On the other hand, pretty soon this reason will disappear... As for #2, I would counter that the people who notice traps at larger sizes are the same people who know they should be using the display cut of the font instead anyway! And when it comes to #3, I'd say it's all in your head. A desire for absolute consistency shouldn't trump real-world quality. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>1. I don't think that Minion will go with a modern serif = vertical stress typeface. <br> <br>2. This is not what you asked, but Minion is a match to Slimbach's Poetica (as Bringhurst notes). The italic of Minion, which I think is very good, harmonizes with Poetica, whereas the italics of other typefaces I tried really clashed. <br> <br>3. I found, as I noted elsewhere, that Open Type version of Minion is a distinct improvement on the original. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I asked about the different weights of Minion on this thread: <br> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/7027.html?1056591110 target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/7027.html?1056591110</a> <br> <br>I learned from Kent Lew there that Slimbach had made changes from the regular to the MM version (no longer sold), and then again to the Open Type version. And John Nolan said he thought the Open Type version was best, even though in general he liked the MM technology. <br> <br>This led me to get the Open Type version, and also (with your encouragement) to upgrade from PageMaker to InDesign - which is wonderful. <br> <br>Now, checking the new version with my own eyes, and setting my book in progress in the OT Minion, I find that the regular weight has gone on a diet, and is now slimmer and prettier. It is between the old regular and display weights. I also sets at nearly the same width as the old display weight - perhaps 5% more narrow than the old regular (I haven't measured it). <br> <br>What led me to my first post here at typofile was the feeling that something was wrong with the regular Minion. It looked too clotted to me at 11 points (though not at 10 points); too closely spaced or something I couldn't exactly put my finger on. <br> <br>I am still not sure what all went into the changes Slimbach made, but I sure think they are an improvement. My former feelings that something was wrong have now vanished, and I think it is a real solid workhorse for text, with some elegance. </div>
