  with it, but dont want to change it either!\r\nDoes anyone know a similar typeface
  (dropped serifs etc) that will \u2018fool\u2019 them into thinking they are still
  using the same logo - I want to propose a subtle change.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  time\r\n\r\nMatt Appleton"

    Pro</a> has the sharp serifs. You could use the Display Small Caps (included in
    the Pro font) and get close.\r\n\r\nAlso, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=4&displayfontid=C.420.0.0&fontRendererText=MRJ+RUNDELL\">Charlemagne</a>."

    body: "Stephen - thanks... these are about a thousand times more elegant - lets
      hope Mr Client buys it!\r\n\r\nI also dug up 'Requiem' by H + FJ - here... http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/index.html
      which is beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has another example - maybe a bit more
      'expressive' on the J, I would love to see it!\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\n\r\nMatt"

    If there are only a couple glyphs that aren't as expressive as you like, you can
    always do a simple edit in Illustrator.

  body: The dropped serifs seem inspired by the love affair with Rotis Semi Serif,
    which is better-constructed but overused. I might suggest starting with Arrow,
    which is classier to begin with, and modify it from there to make it more ownable,
    and closer-in to where they are now.

    find - the font called 'Arrow' mentioned by sullivanj...\r\n\r\nI think I will
    take a decent base as a starting point - maybe Requiem, then propose incremental
    destruction!\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nMatt"
