  thought it was Vista italic and that appears from web search to be a system font
  for Windows Vista. I am on a MAC. Can anyone recommend a similar font. It doesn't
  have to be exact.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    is on the tip of my brain but eludes me. The ampersand is very distinctive.\r\n\r\nI
    need help again. Rush deadlines are killing me!"
