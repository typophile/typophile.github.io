  body: "Distressed is the word. I feel its pain.\r\n\r\nPossibly from a bold [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/copperplate-gothic/33-bc/|copperplate
    gothic]]. It could be a severely squooshed [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/serif+gothic/fonts/|serif
    gothic black]], but the R's are either customised, or from a different font."
