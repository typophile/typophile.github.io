body: "Ignore this post if you\u2019re reading it on a Mac.\r\n\r\nEither I was installing
  it wrong previously, or Microsoft fixed it in 1.4, and I was using 1.3, but finally
  I got Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to install and run in Windows 7, and I used
  it to build a custom German/English \u201Ctypographer\u2019s keyboard\u201D layout.
  (My physical keyboard has a standard German layout.) This enabled me to add a bunch
  of extra punctuation and some archaic stuff such as \u017F.\r\n\r\nI also managed
  to add two dingbats from the Unicode Zapf Dingbats subset range, U+2766 and U+2767.\r\n\r\n\u2766
  \u2767\r\n\r\nIf you can see those, you are seeing them in pure Unicode. Windows
  is switching fonts somewhere to display them.\r\n\r\nMy question: where in Windows
  is the font containing these glyphs? MacOS comes with Zapf Dingbats, but Windows
  does not. They\u2019re not in Arial, or Tahoma, or Segoe, or Wingdings, or Courier,
  Lucida Sans Unicode, or any of the C-fonts. \r\n\r\nI am stumped. How do you hide
  a font in Windows yet still make it accessible in multiple applications?"

  body: "A Very Good Question. They <em>look</em> like Zapf Dingbats, but upon close
    inspection there are a few tiny differences (notably in the right one).\r\n\r\nI
    found a few surprises lurking in my Windows 7 font list (Lucida Sans has a nice
    own interpretation; Segoe UI Symbol has, erm, \"sans\" florals?); but MS Gothic
    is a perfect match for the symbols I see on the screen.\r\n\r\nLeft: MS Gothic,
    Right: What I See in Explorer at 1000% (which may or may not be what you are seeing)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wingding_4283.PNG]\r\n\r\nNote
    esp. the corner points near the tip of the curls -- less visible in the Explorer
    view but still discernable."

    box-drawing characters.)"

    look for an app named Babelmap. It can view and analyse installed fonts."

  body: A HA! Thank you Theunis. They are in MS Gothic, MS Mincho, MS PGothic, MS
    UI Gothic and MS PMincho. Alongside a bunch of other useful stuff. Clever, these
    Japanese.

    XP and 7's fonts contain these.\r\n\r\n(Ah--aforementioned Segoe UI (Symbol) contains
    a few more surprising glyphs: Braille, 8-point 'stroke' letters, all the tetragrams

  body: That's what's puzzling me. They seem to be very common in CJK fonts and older
    system fonts. DejaVu has'em as well. Gotta be dancing elephants or something like
    that, then.

    ended up in Windows core fonts. Most third party fonts tend to skip them even
    if they claim WGL4 support as they are considered optional.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese
    font MS Gothic contains a lot of symbols, and as it's part of the font fall-back
    chain so you'll see them come up quite frequently. "
