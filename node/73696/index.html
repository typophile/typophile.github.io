<p>&ldquo;As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font, and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not obligated to do so.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The OFL has other clauses having to do specifically with typefaces. There is a clause that allows redistribution freely, sale of the typeface bundled with other products, but not sale of the typeface by itself. There is also a clause that requires changing the name of any modified versions of the typeface, meant to protect the good name of the original typeface if someone makes poor modifications, I would guess.  That&rsquo;s my memory of the differences, aided by a quick scan of the license.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The two (the OFL and the GPL+font exception) are quite different, although both are valid free/libre and open source software licensing models for fonts. Although the GPL+font exception model is legally valid, we feel that it does not fit fonts well, and actually discourages the release of free/libre fonts, so we created the OFL. The philosophical differences are that the OFL does a better job of protecting designers in an understandable way and places less restrictions on the use of derivative works. That&rsquo;s a gross oversimplification, but gives you the general idea.</p>
<p>For a lot more detail, read the [[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web|OFL itself]] carefully (it&rsquo;s a lot less wordy than the GPL), and consult the newly-updated [[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web|OFL-FAQ]].</p>

<p>OpenFontLibrary.org (has acronym OFL) and Open Font License (has acronym OFL) and the previous hosts on it&rsquo;s site some of the latter&rsquo;s license fonts.  OpenFontLibrary.org updated the website and removed BBT font from it&rsquo;s URL.  The font had to re-uploaded at OpenFontLibrary.org though another URL was given.  Thus BBT font mentions with previous URL have to be forwarded to the new URL.  Also OpenFontLibrary.org should put all the files that were there on the previous site and not only the font per se ones, for example a file contains this:</p>
