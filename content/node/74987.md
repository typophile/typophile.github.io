    that the alphabet is in public domain such as the wheel. Since then the copyright
    laws have been extended to software. The altering of a letterform is not subject
    to copyright or patent unless the original name has been taken.  I won a lawsuit
    over this matter.\r\nDr. Type"

  body: ">The altering of a letterform is not subject to copyright\r\n\r\nThis may
    be misleading. You can't take an existing digital revival and, eg, change the
    size a little, and legally resell it. The software copyright covers that, as I
    understand it, because of the ruling in Adobe vs SSI. This is in the U.S. \r\n\r\nBut
    as far as an old letter press typeface, I don't know of any restriction on digitizing
    them. The name is a more complicated issue, and there may be restrictions. \r\n\r\n"

    - Can you expand on that at all? I am quite interested in issues of revivals and
    the fact that well known faces such as baskerville, caslon etc... have multiple
    digital cuts from different foundries\r\n\r\nThanks "

  body: "Well, aside from the wild speculation I put in at the end, this post is pretty
    good for a summary:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/01/legal_protectio.html\r\n\r\nNote
    that copyright exists the moment you author something, while trademark and patent
    require paying money and submitting forms. However, you do get more benefits from
    copyright protection if you register the work.\r\n\r\nNote also that almost all
    of this discussion is very US-centric. Broadly speaking, most European countries
    offer equivalent or greater protection.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
