  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Here is one of the new type families I have been working on for the past few months. It started out as a display face but I pushed towards the text face side.  There are 3 weights in the posted PDF: light, regular and bold. There are small caps and oldstyle figures as well as all the CE glyphs. See if you can tell what I have &ldquo;almost&rdquo; done.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I really benefitted from my first font here last year and am hoping the comments will be as fruitful this time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have much critique for you. Like Héctor says, I would try to bring it to market soon.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a request: how about a single-storey g? You always seem to make such peculiar g&rsquo;s. I would like an alternate if I were to use this face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Héctor and Dan, thanks for your kind words and helpful suggestions. I will give them a try. Thanks to your encouragement, I am hoping to submit it to foundries soon.</p>
<p>The first version I drew was the light caps and small caps. I was looking for a squarish face for smallcaps and couldn’t find what I wanted so I started designing my own.  I did a few characters in Adobe Illustrator for a simple heading on the job I was working on.  I then brought it to FontLab to extend.  I did two kinds of Lights, this one which is very regular and squared with equal proportions and another (which I will post soon as a separate face) in classic Roman proportions and much rounder. The lowercase in both was an afterthought at the time. I then did the bold and went back and forth with the light a few times before starting the regular.  I did a “medium” too but it needs work.
Dan, I will try an alternate single-story g which should be quite easy to add. What bothers you about my double-bowl g? I know it is a bit out of mainstream but what else is troubling to you?
Héctor, I will look at the S and &amp; again to see if I can fix them a bit. I understand what you mean about long text.  I would not intend this face for a novel.  You and Dan are right It is a more corporate or technical face.</p>
<p>Has anyone figured out what I “almost” did yet? A hint is in the name and is somewhat apparent on pages 5, 6, &amp; 7 of my PDF.</p>

<p>Dead on Paul!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;almost&rdquo; is that I did not do it intentionally.  It just happened.  I am a very &ldquo;optical&rdquo; kind of guy and just judge everything by eye.  When I did each weight, I did the metrics as I felt would be best for the way it looks.  I didn&rsquo;t even notice how similar the fit was until I printed the above PDF! Now that I see it, I think I will try to push the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; a bit more and see if it works. This &ldquo;Align&rdquo; concept would be a good way to insure fit in text when you were adding bold or light in the copy and then changed your mind.  You would not have to worry about reflow! I am sure someone else must have thought of this before though.</p>

<p>This is not a new concept, but i think most families that employ this use them for maybe only a small range of weights (2-3 max?) I recently did this for the light and regular weights of <a href="http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/cloister.html">LTC Cloister</a>. To see this carried out through a whole range of weights from light to bold (and maybe even black) would be really tricky and something to be proud of, i would think. The big trick is to make sure that none of the designs are overly compromised due to spacing restrictions&hellip;</p>

<p>I guess that I just don&rsquo;t like it. Maybe its a mainstream thing, but I just think that it is wierd. And in display sizes, you can&rsquo;t look away (you can sort of get away with things in text, I guess). Please don&rsquo;t hate me :(</p>

<p>The reason for this is that, on an old [[Linotype Machine]] matrix, you could have two different fonts. But the characters had to have the smae width. The Roman would either be duplexed with the Italic, or with the Bold. This is why Times Bold looks so cramped.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a newspaper Serif face would be duplexed with a Sans. This sort of thing can still be seen in some digital faces, like [[Compatil]].</p>

<p>The V on the regular version is correct.  The other weights I meant to flip but forgot. The rule is set by the lc v and the others should match it.  Only the regular  does so.
I tried both the diagonal M and the squared W and found both too jarring so I went back to the conventional straight M.
The s fits neighboring characters better slopped the way I have done it.  I tried the other way and the stroke just didn&rsquo;t pull around enough.
I fought with the 2 c&rsquo;s many times.  When the size is small the narrower way works; when the type is large, the wider c seems better.  It was more of a color issue and I found I just had to compromise.
I don&rsquo;t understand your comment about the slopes on the EFGKPR terminals. They all slope the same way.  Perhaps you mean it goes against the calligraphic flat pen angle model? The slope direction I gave it gives a bit more air to the lower counter as opposed to the upper making the vertical balance better to my eyes. I didn&rsquo;t feel that the flat pen model had a bearing on such a non-calligraphic face. I just used positive to negative space reasoning (dare I say Notan:-) The angle cuts help reduce dark spots at the joins. This face was intended as more of a tech/corporate as opposed to a warm humanistic face. I think that traditional type and calligraphy savvy users would probably agree with you on that though.</p>
<p>Thanks Nick for taking the time and care to comment and by all means stay :-)</p>

<p>Chris, I agree with Dan. I don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;g&rdquo; either. You do seem to make weird &lsquo;g&quot;s. Sometimes conventional is appropriate. I disagree about the mainstream comment though, because right now two story &ldquo;g&quot;s seem to be all the rage in sans serif faces.</p>

<p>I got so charged up after meeting all of you at TypeCon that I got a burst of energy. I am sure I will crash shortly.  Last year I worked on Leporello (my other weird g face) from April until January and then did nothing until coming back from New York this summer.
I am really a slow piker compared to James Montalbano at TerminalDesign though.  He can really crank it out quick and it&rsquo;s damn good too!</p>

<p>I am wondering if you can find a better solution for the crotches of the diagonals. They don&rsquo;t seem to totally in harmony with the cut joins on the connections of the branches.</p>
<p>Check on whether the a,g,e, and s would be better narrowerer. The curved leg on the K, k looks a little out of place. Should the &lsquo;cut&rsquo; on the &lsquo;a&rsquo; be at the top of the bowl instead of the bottom?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be away from the internet for a while, but good luck with this; it&rsquo;s promising.</p>

<p>Terry, Have you ever scripted Opentype features in FontLab? If not, it might be hard to understand the joke. What I had written in the 2nd PDF was the contextual alternates feature script where the glyph &ldquo;g&rdquo; was substituted for the glyph &ldquo;g.alt&rdquo; when the context was Dan and you as users. This of course is not possible, but it was a fun joke to code anyway:-) Sorry no one got it. :-(
I will redo the magazine page using the alts tonight and post it.</p>

<p>The S and s is the same width but the g is a bit narrower. It takes a bit more space to fit the double bowled g.  William suggested that I make it (and the &ldquo;a&rdquo;) narrower anyway.  The problem comes at smaller sizes. The g and a look too dark and tight when narrowed. At larger sizes, they can be narrowed without any problem.  I will tinker some more and see what I can do with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uniwidth is a great feature, but it tends to exert too much pressure (on the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; widths of the black bodies) on the outlying reaches of color. In the first version of Patria for example all four weights were uniwidth, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the Light to be tight enough without making the letterforms too wide and I couldn&rsquo;t get the Bold to be loose enough without making the letterforms too narrow. A good solution I arrived at was to leave the Regular and Demi uniwidth, but make the Light/Bold spaced tighter/looser by a fixed amount (tracking +/-10) thus giving the user an easy way to force uniwidth if desired.</p>

<p>Hi Kyle, thanks for the input.  I actually started out with a square dot and felt it was too similar to the rest. Since all the strokes are so rectalinear, i thought it would be good to oppose them with a &ldquo;Dot-Line&rdquo; treatment (kinda' Morse Code :-).  As the weights get bolder, you may notice that the dots get more square.  I needed to hold the weight within the narrow space so that was my compromise.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that it disappears.  I think it just takes its place in your personal reference of acceptable syntax. It seems what is happening in this rapidly exploding world of new fonts every day is that our vision of acceptable syntax is growing much more quickly than ever possible before.  This is a good thing.</p>

<p>I think that to naive readers, those who are not involved in typography or design, the oddness is not perceived.  I think the average person just &ldquo;reads&rdquo; it.  I think that people who are very schooled in the typographic arena are more likely to notice that a glyph departs from the mainstream.  Some may have trouble fitting it into an academic reference and it may bother them.  Others, like Héctor, who are more open to variation in form, just accept it as either a viable mutation or dislike it if it does not suit them.  I make a practice of showing text in types I am working on to mostly naive viewers without telling them anything other than to read the text.  I have yet to have anyone comment at all on the font. They just read. We, in the field dissect and categorize, looking for comparisons.  Sometimes this can cloud &ldquo;just looking&rdquo; and get in the way.  It is an occupational hazard I guess :-)
If a women asks her husband if &ldquo;She looks fat in this&rdquo; there will be no honesty in his answer (if he is smart).  If she asks a young child (and she NEVER will), she had better be prepared for the naive but very honest truth.</p>

<p>BUT:
Type&rsquo;s relevance, especially in text, is &ldquo;subvisible&rdquo;. The silence of the layman is a result of an inability to grasp, much less verbalize, what&rsquo;s happening deep in the subconscious; not of the alternative: that all types are basically the same! This is normal, and you&rsquo;re right that asking a type designer is quite often a can of worms. Yup, this makes it all quite a challenge!  :-/</p>

<p>That is why it is very good to have several type designers of different opinions comment. You can get a notion from the disparity of views yet perhaps be opened to some very valid points.  I don&rsquo;t think you should have to heed every suggestion from them.  I think it is good to be forced to take a hard look at your own reasonings and divergence of opinion fosters that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I think is at issue is if like in Meta or Fago the face is really intended to be used in text - or not. It works remarkably well there considering but I think it is really a headline &amp; display face as it is presented at the moment. I have been working on some comments and have been stuck in some sense because of this ambiguity of purpose in my own mind. I suppose that ideally the face could do all these things. But Align&rsquo;s effectiveness as display face will eventaully be reduced by too much emphasis on text &amp; vice versa.</p>
<p>So far I prefer Chris' double bowl g to the single bowl because it adds alot of flavor and is eye catching - and in a pleasing way. But if you were to set an article in Align I would want at least a suggestion of a closed lower bowl. Or the altrenate form. I am not sure it needs to close per se but putting a bend in the end might be a good plan - for text anyway.</p>
<p>The characters that still jump out at me are the w and thed y. In a logo they would arrest attention. A good thing! In text the catch &amp; hold my eye which is tiring. The k and to a minor extent the x also feel this way to me.</p>
<p>The weights don&rsquo;t totally work for me. The Regular feels a little light and the bold feels more like a black to my eye. This effect is far more pronounced on screen than it is on my inkjet. I am curious to see what Hrant&rsquo;s idea looks like in print because the bold feels a little cramped to me. The regular a bit too.</p>
<p>Still, I can&rsquo;t believe how easy this is on the eyes despite the superfical regularity of form. For some reason the irregular features and the pleasantness of the face for text seem greatest in the lightest weight. Does anybody else feel this way? I think that the rythm of the letters works best in the lightest weight. Thats probably why. I would love to see the regular with more light-like spacing!</p>

<p>True.  But despite this underlying truth some fonts seem surprisingly strong in a variety of uses even if one of those uses is a core purpose. This is the ideal I was referring to. I can&rsquo;t advocate splitting the difference.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eben,
Thanks for joining in on the critique!
When I started this face, my intention was just to do a light weight and as a display face (I had a job which needed something like this). I still think the light is the most successful weight.
Regarding the weight issue&ndash;Inkjets notoriously add weight.  When I compare the same page printed on both my inkjet and Laser, It looks like a whole different set of weights.  I have yet to get Lino output or see Align printed offset but I am sure it will be noticably lighter than even my Laser. There is a discussion going on here about proofing which may interest you. <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15453">http://typophile.com/node/15453</a>
Regarding text or display as a target usage&ndash;I can&rsquo;t imagine someone using Align in book publishing but I think it can be used in smaller doses of text. I will allow the user to decide that. I never thought Din would be set as text at all but obviously, many users think otherwise.</p>
