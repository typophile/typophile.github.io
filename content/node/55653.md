    advertising lettering was drawn by hand. Seb is right that the letters seem to
    mix italic and Roman features, even to the rounded s serifs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If I were to venture a guess, I'd say it looks alot like an old Photolettering
    face, a casual didot/bodoni that was originally italic that was un-italicized
    and then vertically squooshed . . .\r\n\r\nEvery reference I have for lowercase
    d's has a flat foot unless it's in an italic . . . That's the big clue . . .\r\n\r\nOtherwise
    PLINC has a category called Centidots which was a Century/Didot blend that could
    be likely . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"
