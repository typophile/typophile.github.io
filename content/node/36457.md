body: I know I read something on this board about problems with positive kerning but
  I couldn't find anything with a search. The fontlab manual say positive kerning
  is not usually recommended but doesn't give a reason. What can go wrong with positive
  kerning?

  body: "I wrote a script to find the minimum (\"largest\" negative) and the maximum
    (largest postive) kerning in the (Regular) Adobe fonts I have. Here is a sample
    of what I got:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerns_5357.gif]\r\nUnless
    my script is bugged, this means that in NuevaStd-Regular the largest positive
    kern is larger than the largest (absolute value) of  the negative kerns. What
    problem could this cause?"

  body: "For Nueva Std, I should have said that the largest positive kern is \"much
    larger\" than the negative, since 137 is 43 larger than 94. \r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand Caslon's largest positive kern is quite large, 150, and Jenson's is even
    larger, 165."
