  styles of type set on, say, a newspaper or poster. Something like The Book Cover
  Archive but for a wider range of media.\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd give it a go. Thanks
  for any response you can provide."

  body: "There's a great book by Tamye Riggs, called <a hreg=\"http://www.papress.com/html/book.details.page.tpl?isbn=9781568988108\">Typeface:
    Classic Typography for Contemporary Design</a>, which shows many classic fonts
    \"in action\".\r\n\r\nNo disrespect to Typophile, but when I want to bombard myself
    with type in action, I go to the \"What The Font\" forum over at myfonts.com.
    It's only logos, but that is a great way to see random fonts in action.\r\n"
