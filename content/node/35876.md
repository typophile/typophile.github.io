  display to take in and enjoy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after seeing the Veer presentation,
  you are inspired to do a massive display script project ALA [[Alejandro Paul]]?
  Or was it the next gen text faces coming out of Mexico that really rocked your boat?\r\n\r\nI
  do know one thing, for some reason I don't think I'm too interested in doing a \"grunge\"
  typeface anytime soon...\r\n\r\nAfter speaking with [[Eben Sorkin]], [[Nick Shinn]],
  [[Kent Lew]] and others, I finally decided to sit down last night to start fleshing
  out the drawings I've had about an upright semi-italic text face I've been doodling
  about for the past two years.\r\n\r\nWhat's your inspiration and/or new project?"

    rounded sans face called Skyliner, which I drew a big chunk of on the plane, and
    I\u2019ve already started building it in TypeTool. I\u2019ve also been inspired
    to selling my extra iPod (they\u2019re giving them away with laptops again) and
    my Intuos 3 (I never use it) so I can buy FontLab. And of course talking to everyone\u2014especially
    Nick and Delve\u2014gave me food for thought regarding my thesis. \r\n\r\nBut
    what was really inspiring was coming back to town and finding out that my awful
    type professor quit and been replaced by one of my favorite professors. I have
    quite literally been dreaming about that happening, so these events coinciding
    with Typecon is so awesome that I\u2019m tempted to find religion."

    a new project really, but I do think 'inspired' would be an appropriate word.

    impressed with the variety of work coming out of Mexico, and as always at the
    sheer number of up and coming type designers out there. It's a really exciting
    time to be involved with type, as the tools and formats have really opened up
    a seemingly endless world of possibility to a wide range of people....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Maybe others could suggest their pick for keynote from the speaker line up, or
    elsewhere?

    really interested in connecting with or relating to their specialized audience.
    Is the keynote a portfolio review or job application? Too often keynote speakers
    have no ideas or message to share with their audience. I thought Tim Girvin, who
    did essentally the same thing, connected with us and tailored his presentation
    to the audience better than Modern Dog. He actually likes type, actually does
    lettering. \r\n\r\nRe: Original question: Where do I start? It will take me a

    grunge typography, honestly. First the Modern Dog, then Pete McCracken, then Art
    Chantry, then that annoying PBS guy, THEN a panel with the three worst of the
    bunch.\r\n\r\nI could have lived with just Art Chantry because he was talking
    about type and his approach to type. The others were regaling us in how <em>cool</em>
    they were and had attitudes that didn't match with the rest of the conference. "

    have fun with type.\r\n\r\n(I was also inspired -- by the TC materials as well
