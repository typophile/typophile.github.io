  CS4.\r\n\r\nI'm using a font that I know has tabular figures but can't find any
  options to use them in\r\nPhotoshop's  Character palette - I can select old style
  figures but not tabular.\r\n\r\n\r\nRr."

    to create text then just copy and paste the text block into Photoshop. Most of
    the OT features will go over with the text even if they look like they are not
    supported by Photoshop.\r\n\r\nMalcolm"
