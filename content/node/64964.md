  but otherwise, I'm open to suggestions\r\n\r\nWhere? Some place central & on a transit
  route, not too pricy or trendy (read not overly crowded and loud) . The closer to
  Union Station, the better for me, and, as it happens, there is no shortage of pubs
  (and what have you) in that area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    getting settled in here, so don't get to the big smoke that much for socializing.
