  body: "If we knew what year that book was printed (clearly NOT 1904) it might eliminate
    typefaces designed after the publication. It's very hard to see the details well
    enough but I would guess some Goudy faces, such as Kennerley, or Goudy 38, both
    of which seemed to have flared T's, and similar G and R shapes.  Other ideas were
    Centaur and Bembo Titling.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: 'Thanks, Mike. Bembo Titling looks awesome. This book was published by Rizzoli
    in the 2008. The "S" has a very elegant curve with the smaller loop on the top
    and a fatter one on the bottom. '

  body: I can't quite make out the detail of the very characteristic capital 'T',
    but the general rhythm reminds me very much of Serlio from Linotype, see http://is.gd/czvFy.
