    saw FF MT, I thought it was hilarious, so I downloaded and installed the font
    right away. (I actually had very sound proffesional <i>humourous distraction required
    here</i> reasons at the time)... Around the same time, I was uninstalling a bunch
    of fonts that I had no use for use. \r\n\r\nThen... Time passed. My dentist asked
    me to re-design the sign I'd done for her before. It was basically an editing
    job, but changed fonts. I did the work in the same file the previous version was
    in so I could show her a quick \"before and after\"... Mean-time, unbeknownst
    to me, one of the fonts I'd deleted was the one I'd used in the old design. For
    some reason, the god's chose to make <b>FF MT</b> the default fall back-up font
    for that file... In the event that to one I'd originally specified should be unavailable.
    She looked at it for a few seconds (\"Dr. Lbvk Dntst...\" and said, \"Um, Russ,
    I think there might be some spelling mistakes there\"... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
