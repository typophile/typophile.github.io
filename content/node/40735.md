  It's been inspired by a similar typeface but redrawn from zero -- no copy/paste
  has been used.\r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas how to make it better or is it good
  enough? The point is that one day Eco should become a commercial typeface. \r\n\r\nNote:
  Eco has only lower case letters because it's a display typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eco01_6103.png]"

    other situations.

    There\u2019s a typeface called <a href=\"http://www.fsd.it/fonts/eco.htm\">Eco</a>
    by Fabrizio Schiavi that\u2019s been around for a while now.\r\n\r\nOther than
    that, I\u2019m not sure your typeface quite works yet. Many glyphs seem confusing
    and out of touch with the others (s, x, k, z, v, y) and I second Kevin\u2019s
    take about the c and t being difficult to tell apart. Are there any uppercase
    letters? Punctuation? \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to sound overly negative: as a
    display typeface it might have some uses, but my humble advice is to keep working
    on it. Modular/geometric typefaces like the one you\u2019re doing are very hard
    to do right, because of the crudeness of the shapes you necessarily have to work
    with. I hope this helps."

  body: "yes indeed, the t is almost a c. i could draw uppercase letters but i'm asking
    myself is there a need for them in this particular typeface? in my opinion the
    confusion in spacing is caused by the screen rendering. it might look better when
    printed.\r\n"
