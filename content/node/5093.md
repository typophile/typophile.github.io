  a family of fonts in the search of an identity on local design. The font is inspired
  in italics, made by hand by vernacular painters in the popular commerce. The attached
  pdf pages shows the comparision between the italic a and my regular interpretation

  <BR>I notice that the inverted contrast its similar to Antique Olive, so i found
  very interesting that i dont know about other fonts with invert contrast, working
  as a text font..? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your critiques! <BR> <BR>mh <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

    of a country. <BR> <BR>This is for the Hrant missing arguments for the name...
    <BR> <BR>I think in use Chile for my proyect, is a challenge, because i know that
    many of the discussions about design here, in Chile, are about identity of our
    country, there are many people that will be desagree about nemed a font as a country,
    they can have political or ethic arguments, or just personal thoughts. <BR> <BR>Name
    a font just like my country is about that, i like the word, the sound of it a
    lot, i like the ch starting names, i think it have a commercial potential too,
    is short, easy to learn, it is my interpretation of the following question..how
    can be you personal popular culture enviroment interpretation of a useful local
    press font family? can a font or a group of fonts help to the richness of the
    culture in your town, better if your town or country have not his own typography

    or inappropriate. I think they meant that your font can do much better than to
    be named after a country :&#62; <BR> <BR>Anyways, I tend to respect people&#39;s
    decisions when it comes to naming fonts. It&#39;s like naming a child - a very

    <BR> <BR> <BR>When i discover the fact that, when start a sans regular font based

    the serifs flare out &#40;like you have in the &#34;c&#34; for example&#41;. If
