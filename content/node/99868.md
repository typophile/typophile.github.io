      you Ryuk! I posted a jpeg with some more text, hopefully this confirm your suspicions.
      Either way thank you!"

    theft" or pirated version available for free?

    like Eurostile would be effective.\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nand, if you select only the
    weight you need from Foundry, it's under $100 instead of buying the whole package."

    I thought you were setting a trap for principle-free people, but then I started
    thinking the trap was for me... But it doesn't matter: sadly it's pretty clear
    that nobody (except Jodie) thought your post was worth confronting. Which is the
    worst thing for this place.\r\n\r\nJodie: Good suggestions.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
