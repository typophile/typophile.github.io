  target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?30/11599</a> <BR>about the
  grid - or no grid - in business cards.  <BR>Mr. Anonymous came to the idea that
  it would be a good idea to show eachothers our businesscards and try to find wether
  or not there is a grid behind it. <BR>I want to take the risk and show you my card.
  I&#39;m a &#39;believer&#39; of using no grid for businesscards. Can you find one
  in mine? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11988.jpg"

  body: Mine is indefensible. <BR> <BR>BTW, when you guys say &#34;grid&#34;, do you
    maybe mean &#34;a set of alignment lines&#34; instead? Because I avoid the former,
    but do value the latter. The difference is that -to me- a grid is a network of
    equally spaced lines in both dimensions &#40;although not necessarily square&#41;
    that things are made to fit inside, while the other is a set of flexible &#40;in
    position and number&#41; lines that things are made to line up on &#40;like Ren

    but not to a noticable grid. <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;ll have to dig up my business
    card files and see what I&#39;ve done with the last few.

  body: 'nice attitude - But why &#34;.....using no grid...&#34;? <BR> <BR>it&#39;s
    not important what is the size of the artwork/design  = 2 by 5, 6 by 9, 24 by
    54. <BR> <BR>rule #1 is to know the rule. <BR> <BR>there MUST be one spot or area
    to which the other parts are subordinate and to which the EYE  is immediatley
    attracted. this , the starting-point for viewing, must be SIMPLE and uncluttered
    and have the essential ingredient of leading the eye on further into the design.
    <BR> <BR>so - call it grid, 2 lines, 30 lines,  composition....etc., etc.,   -
    rule is a rule.  you need to use it - but be creative, not MECHANICAL. <BR> <BR>

  body: Very true, David.  <BR>But does one need for that to make a &#39;grid&#39;,
    as a horizontal and/or vertical setup where to put what? <BR>I agree with the
    fact that you have to lead the eye to the key-point &#40;with a businesscard that
    is mostly the name or the logo&#41; in the design. From there on you have then
    to access the rest of the information. I call this hierarchy. That is in every
    design important. Otherwise all the elements try to be the Nr. 1. <BR> <BR>Who
    works than with a real &#39;Grid&#39; to design businesscards? I&#39;m interested
    to see how that then works. I agree with Hrant that you have to have optical allignments.
    Is that then the grid??? <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: Here goes. <BR> <BR>This the new ID system for my freelance business. Designed
    to a grid? As Keith suggested, the internal design grid. This was designed knowing
    that I was moving in the near future. Name and address info are two rubber stamps.
    That way, all I need to do is get new stamps once the move is complete. Also,
    I don&#39;t go through a ton of letterhead, so I make them one at a time with
    the stamps on whatever paper I want. Envelopes printed one color then stamped
    with the correct address. So crafty. <BR> <BR>Randy <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12200.gif"

    a shame to implement poor design decisions into the web site.  <BR> <BR>At the
    very least, give your site visitors the option. <BR> <BR>Also note that I use

    deal with the fact that so many design firms think maxed/chromeless windows are
    a good thing...it&#39;s just that your business cards are so nice!&#41; <BR> <BR>Do
