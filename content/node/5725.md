body: Damn, I was stuck with the futura for ages, but seeing it in a Wallmart ad,
  I kind of feel like removing it from my personal favorites and particularly my CV.
  Yet, I am seeking for a font with similar quality and variations but not overly
  used, that the risk of seing it on a toilet paper is minimal. But not very fancy
  either, just simple and elegant. I tried the usual everyday sans-serif fonts such
  as optima, gill, univers, frutiger, fr.gothic and so on, but nothing strikes me,
  and unfortunately that&#39;s as far as my basic knowledge can get me. Anybody has
  anything to suggest, a little more special? Thanks.

  body: Linotype&#39;s new Avenir NEXT, redesigned by Adrian Frutiger &#40;designer
    of the original Avenir&#41; and Akira Kobayashi! <BR> <BR>http://www.linotype.com/85940/avenirnext-family.html?PHPSESSID=f84294bd75a2274840b189cb6d7d5e88
    <BR> <BR>This is like Futura, but Adrian Frutiger-ized... so you have two storey
    a&#39;s instead of Renner&#39;s single storey a&#39;s. Plus, because of OpenType,
    Frutiger has made available never-seen-before Avenir OldStyle Figures and Small
    Caps as options. <BR> <BR>This would make your CV rock. &#40;Avenir is the official
    typeface of the city of Amsterdam, among other things. Those Dutch designers know
    a thing or two about type&#41;

    Black</a>? Ha ha, that was a joke. It was used as the typeface of our local football
    team some time in the early &#39;70s and hasn&#39;t officially been changed. Sorry
    for the digression.

  body: Kabel and Nobel &#40;and Avant Garde&#41; are showing their age much  <BR>more
    than Futura - as Futura has more timeless proportions. But I agree  <BR>that Futura
    is overused. Avenir is cropping up in a lot more  <BR>places too, but that&#39;s
    not necessarily a bad thing.  <BR> <BR>Check out Gotham. Gotham&#39;s ascenders
    aren&#39;t so tall, which  <BR>makes it less fussy to work with and gives a slightly
    more  <BR>&#34;friendly&#34; flavor. This also makes Gotham&#39;s condensed <BR>weights
    more natural. Futura Condensed has always made me  <BR>queasy.
