  a concept suit to help with the problem of heat stress in the migrant worker population
  in Qatar - I am really having trouble selecting a typeface - any suggestions - I
  am gravitating towards a slab serif or semi serif, maybe humanist (not sure though),
  with a true italic, with an attractive \"&\" and \"Q\"... any suggestions? ShouldI
  just go with Adobe Caslon or Adobe Jenson?Need help\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    complete strangers about what typeface to choose? Your question is as open-ended
    as it gets, as if you didn\u2019t learn a thing about design in your studies.
    Sounds to me like you wasted your money."

  body: Now that's a harsh statement Frode. Not all designers are typographers, but
    most designers at sometime have to express themselves in typography. So pretty
    please, with sugar on top, give the man a few pointers.

  body: "hello all,\r\nFrode Bo Helland: As clauses pointed out (thank you clauses)
    I am not a typographer, so that's why I thought I would ask the professionals.
    \r\n\r\nhrant, yes you are right I am a woman and my name does mean \"high.\"
    :) As for the text, well I do have a lot of text, I'd say that in some areas such
    as the introduction and conclusion there is just text, whereas in other areas
    such as the precedents and context, the ration is about 60:40 (text:imagery).
    The design process part has more imagery, but it varies from one section to the
    other, so maybe 30% or 20%  is text in that chapter. The issue is that I have
    quite a few \"styles\" of imagery/illustration. I have photographs of workers
    (as part of a photo analysis); images of materials, my process, the prototypes
    (in a studio setting with a seamless background); and the final concept suit worn
    by a model in a desert setting. I also have illustrations. Illustrations of indigenous
    desert wear, drawn and then rendered and colored (filled in with fabric textures)
    \ and fashion-style pencil sketches  - there are a lot of things going on but
    each section has one form/style of image and there is a progression from raw sketch
    to polished studio shot.\r\n\r\nThere will not be Arabic at all.\r\n\r\nI hope
    that helps...\r\n\r\nThanks"

    well with those fonts. Or you just don't have the money to purchase those fonts
    I would think Palatino might work just as well. . . But take hrant, claus or frode's
    advice over mine since I am just some random web designer and not a type specialist."

  body: "Nothing looks better than Palatino + Optima, and you really can use them
    pretty much everywhere. Still, their formal, classical design might not be the
    ideal fit in a given context: for example, Modernism calls for a neutral or effectively
    invisible face like Helvetica, where Palatino and Optima have too much character
    to avoid drawing attention to themselves. High fashion calls for an artificial
    face like Bodoni, where Palatino is too old-fashioned, natural, and even friendly,
    and Optima is too classical. There are good reasons why Helvetica and Bodoni are
    such clich\xE9s in these contexts. ;^) And all of the above faces are too formal
    for folk art or \"Arts and Crafts.\" Type is a vehicle, and you want to arrive
    in the right style for the party you're attending.\r\n\r\nThat said, Palatino
    is a pretty safe choice, and I'd use it all over if it had better support for
    linguistics. (Gimme the full IPA, please!) Actually, that's a good point to elaborate
    upon... if you want to mix Latin and other letters in a harmonious multilingual
    style, you'll need a unified face, which severely limits your options -- you might
    be stuck with Times New Roman.\r\n"

      that a bit, please? What is it about Palatino and Optima (or either separately)

      all, I'm the guy who decided to kern Papyrus), but other than severe overuse
      by a rabid fan club and a stunted t, what am I not seeing about Palatino?\r\n"

    and many years of paying attention: Palatino is neither neutral enough nor contemporary
    enough. Using it for this project is like casting a stage actor from the 50s in
    a gritty 21st century movie. Is there really a shortage of good movie actors that
    people can relate to in 2013? BTW, it's also not really a text face - Aldus is
    actually Palatino's bookworm sister.\r\n\r\n* Which means I don't think you \"should
    dislike\" anything just because I do.\r\n\r\nAs for Optima, it's overused for
    so much hyper-feminine stuff, plus it's so incredibly gray... It's like one of
    those old women with purple hair. Avoid.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think re-kerning Papyrus
    was not at all a bad idea.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    suggestions and comments. Avance and orpheus look good. Since you advised against
    Palatina and Optima, I will stay away from them:)What do you think of Matrix II,
    Scala, Eureka, Nexus or Fairplex? I looked at Adobe Caslon and Adobe Jenson, but
    they seem too somber that's why I thought maybe a slab serif would be better?\r\n\r\nI
    will try and give you more information about my thesis, so that you have a better
    picture. BTW the thesis is in English and will not include another language.\r\n\r\nIn
    brief, the thesis deals with the problem of heat stress in migrant workers in
    Qatar by designing a concept suit that facilitates thermal comfort. The thesis/concept
    suit has two protagonists: pragmatic function and conceptual form. The function
    uses indigenous desert clothing systems, heat exchange mechanisms and the body's
    thermo-sensitive regions as well as current technical and smart materials to improve
    thermal comfort. The form borrows from fiction\u2014superheros to be exact\u2014to
    signify the importance, of the otherwise invisible migrant worker, to the Qatari
    economy. \r\n\r\nso basically, thesis elements are: indigenous, low tech, superheroes,
    masculine, science, fashion\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FAS_0911_2_6241.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1830_5991.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Boubou_4202.jpg]"
