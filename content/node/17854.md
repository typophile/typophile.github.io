body: "Hi all-\r\n\r\nI am looking for a Blackletter font that may or may not be called
  sagesse primordiale. It looks similar to Ayers Royal but with more pronounced flourishes.
  I have attached a very bad gif of it, but it will give an idea of how it looks.
  I would be so happy if I could find it!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help offered
  with this.\r\n\r\n"

    is.

    body: "hey wait...It's squished.\r\nSo my next question is who took the poor,
      poor typeface, squished it and called it Decadentia? Anyone know what the original
      is called? I might use Decadentia though."

  body: "Actually, Decadentia is not correct. That was one of Manfred Klein's filter-a-font
    experiments. The typeface he used was either <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Paul Lloyd's</a> Ruritania or Dieter Steffmann's <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/r/rothenbg.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Rothenburg Decorative</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the typeface's
    original name was, but, as a rule, Steffmann tends to use the original while Lloyd
    makes up his own names. Still, I like Lloyd's font Ruritania better. It seems
    a little cleaner.\r\n\r\nIf you stretch either of these, you will get a match.
    Decadentia's distorted characters won't work. Look at the 'm' for the most obvious
    mismatch."

  body: "yes.. Decadentia is really awful now that I look at it. Ruritania is beautiful
    but savoy is absolutely gorgeous and without all the little artifacts stuck to
    it.\r\n\r\n"
