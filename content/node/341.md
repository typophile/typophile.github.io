    that really makes sense to me are the ones that fix problems: like the beak of
    the &#34;f&#34; touching the dot of the &#34;i&#34;. The other ones &#40;like
    &#34;ct&#34;&#41; are usually too decorative. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I feel
    that ligatures have an abscure functional advantage: they diverge boumas&#42;.
    But it&#39;s very hard to use them properly in this manner, and the gain is admittedly
    small. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html" target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>In the functional realm, it&#39;s worth pointing out that children only
    start reading boumas around the age of 9. So if the books are for younger kids,
    there&#39;s a very good reason <i>not</i> to use ligatures: individual letters
    have to be highly decipherable, so the dot of the &#34;i&#34; can be very important
    for example. Choose a font where the &#34;f&#34;-&#34;i&#34; sequence sets well
    by default - that usually means a shy lc &#34;f&#34;, but... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I would have to say that it depends on the level of the book. If the reading
    is going to be done on the sentence level the kids are old enough to undestand
    a ligature. If the book is quite short, where reading is done on a per-letter
    basis, i.e. b-a-l-l, than I would deffinately skip the ligature. <BR> <BR>As I
    understand it good typography is about readability. Ligatures aid that by clarifying
    places in a word where the combination of letterforms is awkeward. Everyone likes
    that. And I can imagine as a kid ligatures would seem fancy and interesting.  <BR>
    <BR>As a father I would appreciate any addition of quality and sophistication
    to my childrens books. I believe that they will adapt to any level of sophistication
    they are presented with. For me ligatures are a go

  body: While I appreciate John&#39;s comment. I would have to say that you shouldn&#39;t
    use ligatures. Children, especially those learning to read, are also developing
    writing skills. I would think that ligatures would introduce confusion. At that
    level it would be difficult to depend upon conformity in the typography of the
    books they are reading.  <BR> <BR>It is also important, I think, to keep dyslexia
    in mind. Those children already struggle with this disorder. It could be especially
    damaging for them.

    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not easy getting other people to use a new word. I know, &#39;cause
    I&#39;ve been trying since my pre-teen years. When I moved back to Beirut after
    living in Palo Alto for 2.5 years, I tried to introduce &#34;moron&#34; to my
    classmates. I think like three of them were using it profusely by the following
    year. But &#34;bouma&#34; is much harder, because you never hear it on TV, plus
    the target group is adults. The advantage is that the concept itself is pretty
    old by now - even though it&#39;s never been explained properly, at least not
    in the context of typography. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think there are now almost a
    dozen people who use it without quotes or italics or anything, which is great.
    And it&#39;s possible they&#39;ve passed it on to people who haven&#39;t been

    I have a problem with your <i>boumas</i>. I think understanding of reading has
    advanced considerably in the past hundred years or so, but it is not complete,
    and one of the areas that we still don&#39;t fully understand is exactly <i>how</i>
    we recognise these clusters of letters. I&#39;m not aware of evidence that eradicates
    the possibility that we are assimilating multiple data <i>including the sub-pattern
    of individual letters within the larger pattern of the cluster.</i> I don&#39;t
    think there are grounds to over-promote the &#39;nebulous&#39; by forcibly demoting
    individual letters beyond consideration. The &#39;legacy misconception&#39; is
    that we read by moving from letter to letter; this is clearly bunkum and has been
    known to be false for a long time, but recognising this misconception is not the
    same thing as saying that individual letters do not contribute to the recognition
    of, ahem, bouma-shapes. Obviously individual letters <i>do</i> contribute to this
    recognition, because they define the overall bouma-shape, but I don&#39;t think
    we know enough, yet, about how this recognition takes place.

    we are assimilating multiple <BR>&#62; data including the sub-pattern of individual
    letters within the larger pattern of the cluster. <BR> <BR>But it is there. Herman
    Bouma did a lot of it. <BR> <BR>There is empirical evidence of the retina&#39;s
    acuity distribution, empirical evidence of the degree of recognizability of individual
    letters within the parafovea, and empirical evidence that saccades exceed the
    range of the &#40;hi-res&#41; fovea by about a factor of three. One can only conclude
    that individual letters are simply not used more than half the time. Bunches of
    people have concluded this. <BR> <BR>So for example Larson&#39;s mistake -I presume-
    is to assume that ClearType text is fully immersive, and that throws eveything
    off, in many ways. <BR> <BR>&#62; forcibly demoting individual letters beyond
    consideration. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right - not beyond consideration. In fact when
    you run into a brand new word, your resort to letter compilation. But that&#39;s
    rare. And really, the best reason not to compile letters into words is good old-fashioned
    efficiency: letter distribution is not flat, and frequent groups of letters greatly
    reduce the overall recognition time of a text, because things proceed in clumps.
    Even in the hi-res fovea, boumas are used primarily, simply because it&#39;s much
    faster. The brain is a quick and dirty little devil. <BR> <BR>The basic valuable
    conclusion of the bouma model is that legibility of individual letters and readability
    of real texts are somewhat opposed. Not totally opposed of course, but think of
    it as vectors 90 degrees apart. So a letter that is too much itself is bad for
    reading, and a letter that easily decomposes into components -in the low-frequency
    &#40;blurry&#41; layer of perception-, for example thanks to stroke contrast,
    is good for reading. This is a core reason why some studies have found that sans
    fonts are more &#34;legible&#34;, while others have found the opposite. <BR> <BR>hhp

    lot more that I thought you were giving individual letters credit for. Consider,
    though, your own examples of readability in para-foveal vision on your website:
    apart from the very obvious benefit of clear ascenders, there are evident benefits
    of certain letterforms within the bouma-shapes that limit fixations and regressions.
    The lowercase k in your images seems to me a good example of this. In order to
    say that a bouma-shape in one typeface is more readable than a bouma-shape in
    another typefaces is necessarily to say that individual letterforms have a profound
    impact on bouma-shape recognition. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not debating legibility vs.
    readability; I largely agree with you on that front. I&#39;m saying that individual
    letterforms provide the underlying sub-patterns of all bouma shapes, and this
    needs to be incorporated into a useful description of reading. There is a very
    simplistic and reductionist view that says bouma-shapes are recognised by their
    &#39;outline&#39;, but the examples on your own website clearly show the importance
    of internal shapes and space within the bouma-shape. When multiple data are contributing
    to pattern recognition in a complex way, I don&#39;t think it is a good idea to
    talk about &#39;demoting&#39; the importance of a particular kind of datum, even
    if the intent is to correct an historical conceptual imbalance, albeit one to
    which almost no one still holds. Why not simply try to be accurate and, when necessary,
    acknowledge the incompleteness of our description of reading and, hence, the uncertainty
    of our practical responses? I&#39;m not advocating paralysis: there is still a
    lot we can learn from the description and apply to type design.'

    <BR>Ah, but you&#39;re looking at it &#34;deliberatively&#34;: you have all the

    individual letterforms have a profound impact on bouma-shape recognition. <BR>
    <BR>Well, sure. It&#39;s just a matter of understanding <i>how</i> a letter participates
    in reading. The distinction between the letter-wise and bouma models affects the
    ideal x-height size for example. <BR> <BR>&#62; There is a very simplistic and
    reductionist view that says bouma-shapes are recognised by their &#39;outline&#39;
    <BR> <BR>Yes, that is <i>somewhat</i> simplistic, especially in the foveal region
    &#40;which still uses boumas primarily&#41;. But it&#39;s a fact that the brain
    recognizes shapes outside-in: it starts with the silhouette, and works itself
    inward <i>as needed</i>. The point is that the better the silhouette, the faster
    the reading. <BR> <BR>Again, avoid seeing the forms &#34;deliberatively&#34;:
    that&#39;s in fact the difference between legibility and readability. <BR> <BR>Good

    them words and tell them what they are, and they&#39;ll become immersive readers
    sooner. <BR> <BR>But over here I haven&#39;t heard of trying any &#34;special

    but the tendency of the human brain to process information as quickly as possible

  body: 'I base my view -- that the majority of reading, in the sense of cognitive
    processing of perceptual elements &#40;as opposed to the wider sense that includes
    liminal recognition of peripheral cues, regression, etc.&#41;, takes place in
    foveal vision -- on what studies indicate about the phenomenon of lateral masking.
    This is the phenomenon by which adjacent shapes in parafoveal vision actually
    <i>distort</i> perception of each other: note, not blur each other, as the illustrations
    on your website suggest, but distort. This distortion, because it is the result
    of interaction between letters, is present not at the individual letter recognition
    level <i>but at the bouma-shape level</i>. The lateral masking of adjacent letters
    in parafoveal vision results in radically underdetermined bouma-shapes, with no
    recourse to internal details because it is the distortion of these details that
    is affecting the bouma-shape as a whole. <BR> <BR>That said -- but without undermining
    the view that <i>most</i> cognitive processing during reading involves perception
    in foveal vision -- the quality of cues available in parafoveal vision <i>are</i>
    affected by type design, which can certainly make it harder or easier to anticipate
    fixations. Mansfield, Legge and Ortiz &#40;University of Minnesota&#41; published
    an interesting study in which they addressed the &#39;paradox&#39; of lateral
    masking: the fact that lone letters in parafoveal vision, without flanking letters,
    are easily recognised, but strings of letters become unrecognisable either as
    individual letters or as groups of letters. They measured the phenomenon of lateral
    masking as the space between shapes with and without &#39;joining flanks&#39;
    was reduced, with some interesting implications re. the usefulness of serifs.
    Lateral masking is released when shapes with &#39;joining flanks&#39; get so close
    enough to form a single figure. In other words, letters with &#39;joining flanks&#39;,
    e.g. serifs, are more likely to release lateral masking and form recognisable
    letter clusters, but note the central implication of all this: bouma-shapes are
    <i>built up</i> from individual letters, whose form and interaction determine
    the recognisability of the bouma-shape. <BR> <BR>This is the conclusion of the
    Mansfield, Legge and Ortiz paper, with direct implications for your &#39;nebulous&#39;
    reading concept: <i>A &#39;blurring&#39; explanation cannot account for the release
    of masking when the flanks and target form a single figure. Our finding suggests
    that lateral masking occurs only after figural segmentation.</i>'

    <i>dessimate</i> parafoveal information the way you seem to be implying. Three
    things: <BR>1&#41; LM doesn&#39;t affect <i>all</i> shape-adjacencies, just certain

    as I understand, even foveal vision isn&#39;t immune to LM. <BR>3&#41; Without
    any empirical measurements of saccade length versus foveal span, you could plausibly
    use LM to think what you do. But the empirical measurements are in fact there
    to give credence to the view that the parafovea is the major player - the evidence
    is where the idea comes from, to me. How could saccades span three times more
    text than the fovea can see while enabling us to still read? Again: what kind
    of data from the parafovea can provide such a good location to saccade to next,
    while not providing significant usable textual information, especially in such
    a wide span? <BR> <BR>&#42; The other -actually the much bigger one- is something
    that <i>nobody</i> seems to understand yet &#40;and I&#39;m not holding my breath
    that it&#39;ll happen in my lifetime&#41;: how the brain maps a shape to a concept.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; strings of letters become unrecognisable <BR> <BR>But other experiments

    your elaboration makes me think that the UoM researchers&#42; validate the bouma
    model! You can&#39;t single out <i>individual</i> letters in the parafovea, but
    when multiple letters cluster together they form a nice big shape &#40;that also
    happens to be more efficient for reading&#41;. And serifs are very interesting:
    my view is that they help readability in effect because they hinder legibility!  :-/

    also check out this: &#34;Enhancing the perception of form in peripheral vision&#34;
    by G Geiger and J Y Lettvin, &#39;85 - it contains some very interesting LM research.
    <BR> <BR>Also, the issue might very well be that they were measuring deliberative
    decipherment but in the parafovea &#40;not the fovea where it happens naturally&#41;,
    and that&#39;s not something that happens in normal reading: you don&#39;t stare
    at a point and try to figure out what&#39;s a few centimeters to the right of
    it! Where consciousness fails -by worrying too much about absolute recognition-
    the subconscious might very well say: Who cares if I&#39;m not sure? It&#39;s
    close enough - let&#39;s just assume the most probable case based on the semantic
    context of the actual phrase, and move on, and if we were wrong, we&#39;ll regress
    &#40;which in fact does happen&#41;. Speaking of regressions: they could only
    happen if reading is in fact a &#34;lossy&#34; process. <BR> <BR>As for merely

  body: Brian, your DIY testing is interesting. I&#39;ve learned that on occasion
    astronomers actually use parafoveal vision consciously &#40;it helps them see
    flicker in celestial bodies, since the fovea is less sensitive to movement&#41;,
    and one day I hope to explore than personally myself. <BR> <BR>&#62; distortions
    <BR> <BR>The distorions are complex, sometimes mysterious, and they happen in
    different realms. In terms of raw acuity &#40;resolution&#41;, biological and
    perceptive tests have revealed that the retina has a small central area of high
    acuity, beyond which acuity plunges deeply, and then plateaus. Picture a narrow
    bell curve with the top sheared flat. So in terms of rod/cone &#34;hardware&#34;,
    the fovea has suberb resolution, while the parafovea starts blurry and gets blurrier.
    In addition to blurring, there&#39;s a strange phenomenon called Lateral Masking
    which causes certain shape adjacencies to implode, so to speak, reducing decipherability.
    LM is not very well understood yet, but from what I understand it happens at a
    higher level than the retina. Lastly, there&#39;s the issue of deliberative/conscious
    versus immersive/subconscious perceptual processing. When you get somebody to
    focus on a point, and you then ask him to deliberately describe what he sees some
    distance to the side &#40;usually the right&#41;, how accurately does that reflect
    what happens when we read &#34;naturally&#34;? It can be said -and I would agree-
    that the amount of information the immersed mind needs to feel satisfied that
    a bouma has been deciphered is much less than the conscious mind needs to feel
    like it&#39;s answering an explicit decipherment question adequately. <BR> <BR>In
    terms of empirical findings, Herman Bouma has done tests to measure the acuity
    of the parafovea &#40;both in the recognition of individual letters as well as
    the recognition of component letters of [short] words&#41;, and a few researchers

    to be. <BR> <BR>But really, more important is that overall &#34;cultural&#34;
    attitude. It&#39;s pretty clear to me that type designers as a whole haven&#39;t
    been taking the technical aspects of the craft seriously enough, perhaps as a
    result of the &#34;romantic&#34; 90s. This atechnical attitude is contagious,
    and it permeates type users as well as designers. With more understanding of why
    boumas for example matter, readers will end up benefiting. <BR> <BR>A specific
    example that sticks in my mind is Bilak&#39;s Eureka, and how it was [mis]used
    in One &#40;?&#41; magazine. Eureka is a wonderful font in many ways, including
    a modest x-height, but it&#39;s too loose to form good boumas, and this is a direct
    result of Bilak&#39;s announced attempt to make the individual letters more legible&#42;.
    Now, this looseness could always be largely corrected through negative tracking
    in the layout app, but of course you&#39;d have to know that&#39;s the problem.
    One magazine soon abandoned Eureka and went with something ultra-conservative
    &#40;Minion or something&#41;. Although I have no proof, I do have a strong suspicion
    that: they realized its readability was low, but had no idea how to fix it, so
    they panicked and decided to play it super-safe. All they really needed to do
    is apply negative tracking - but they didn&#39;t know what that really does to
    a text face. <BR> <BR>&#42; The good news is that his more recent work, like Fedra-Serif,
    is much more well-rounded - and yet doesn&#39;t forsake his wonderful originality.

    <BR>The discussion here is informal, but the level is pretty high compared to
    what type designers usually get exposed to. Forget the intricacies of lateral
    masking, the bulk of the design community has yet to grasp the basics. This boumas
    stuff <i>is</i> pretty radical to most people, and when you listen carefully to
    what even some of the most highly-regarded designers really have to say, you realize
    that they often have no idea about this stuff. They make the most basic of mistakes,
    like believing that serifs create some kind of &#34;flow&#34;... So how do they
    still manage to make good fonts? Simple: follow the established -and generally
    sound- conventions. Mimic. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <i>prospects</i> are better than they&#39;ve been in 30 years! :-&#41; But I am
    indeed negative about where they&#39;ve been recently, and still largely are.
    <BR> <BR>Together, we are trying to lift the craft out of this quagmire. Let&#39;s
    see if our arms hold up. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I guess our main divergence of opinion
    here concerns the balance of importance of the silhouette &#40;envelope&#41; versus
    the internal details of a bouma. Larson notwithstanding. <BR> <BR>As happens often
    enough to keep me online, thanks to this thread &#40;and countless other threads
    on many forums&#41; as well as some private exchanges, I&#39;ve clarified my own
    views on this particular matter, unifying many disparate ideas: <BR> <BR>The retina
    provides the brain with a great amount of information. Perhaps to manage this
    overload efficiently, the brain processes this information in layers of frequency:
    starting with &#34;blurry&#34; low-frequency versions that can be analyzed quickly,
    and moving to sharper higher frequency versions that take longer. The number of
    such layers the brain resorts to depends on need. In terms of reading text &#40;composed
    of horizontal lines of well-defined b&amp;w forms&#41;, there may only be two
    layers of frequency needed: a coarse one that conveys sufficient detail of silhouette,
    and a sharp one that conveys fully unambiguous data &#40;where individual letters
    could be -but are generally not- fully deciphered&#41;. <BR> <BR>My view is that
    the low-frequency data is usually adequate to decipher a bouma, considering the
    rich context of actual language. This view is substantiated by the fact that the
    parafovea &#40;which cannot convey the higher frequencies that the fovea can,
    but which is larger&#41; covers most of the reading surface during immersive reading.
    It is also substantiated by research which has shown that the brain processes
    shapes &#34;outside-in&#34;. In truth this outside-in business is misleading,
    because there&#39;s really no such &#34;geographic progression&#34;: it&#39;s
    a matter of subsequent processing of increasingly higher-frequency data, where
    internal details become increasingly clear. However, the level of detail needed
    to strike a balance in reading between speed and limiting errors is sufficienty
    expressed in the parafovea, upto ~3 times the span of the fovea. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Append: <BR>And it&#39;s not really a matter of parafovea versus fovea, since
    the latter also conveys the low-frequency data first &#40;because it&#39;s processed
    faster&#41;. However, the fovea can convey the higher-frequency version of the
    data when needed: when the silhouette is not good enough; or when the bouma is
    unknown and letter-wise decipherment/compilation &#40;the slowest of the slow&#41;
    becomes unavoidable. Note that in the former case: if the silhouette is in the
    parafovea it results in a fixation upon it; if it&#39;s already in the fovea it
    means internal details will in the end be needed for adequate decipherment. <BR>
    <BR>So: <BR>The better the bouma, the less often the higher-frequency layer is
    <BR>needed, because that translates into greater reading speed/comfort. <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR> <BR>I believe the sihouette is shot through with white: the white of the
    counters. When I have some time over the next couple of days I&#39;ll post an
    explanation of why I believe this high contrast pattern is important and, also,
    why I think it is not only perceived in immersive reading but is actually unavoidable.'
