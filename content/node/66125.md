  the course of it's ten year life on TV. \r\nThis version is from 1965 - would anybody
  be kind enough to hazard a guess a what it could be?\r\n\r\nMany thanks \r\nbest\r\nPaul"

    (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/capital/), but it's flared, or Radiant
    (http://new.myfonts.com/search/name%3Aradiant/fonts/), but it's too round.\r\nIn
    the meantime, hoping someone could find it, here's the recreation of one amateur:\r\nhttp://theavengers.tv/forever/misc-6.htm"

  body: There were some film faces back in the '60s/'70s that were similar--California
    Grotesk, Ibsen--but I can't find anything with such high contrast between thicks
    and thins. It's either custom or something really obscure.

  body: The case of font used for The Avengers is interesting, and certainly during
    Series 4 and Series 5 of the Diana Rigg episodes, the graphic design was of a
    very high calibre.  For the monochrome (Series 4) programmes, I have only ever
    found the font as mentioned above by riccardO.  For Series 5, however, it appears
    the font used was Compacta, and for the opening fanfare 'The Avengers In Color'
    it appears to be Compacta Outline.  Apart from the title, Compacta was also used
    in Series 4, along with a combination of Helvetica.
