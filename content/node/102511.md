  body: "Pretty convinced as almost all work by [[http://www.caleboweneveritt.com|Caleb
    Owen Everitt]] @[[http://www.workbyland.com/#/forestbound-bag-co|L A N D]], it
    should be a custom lettering either from scratch (mimicing or not some existing
    typeface) or a heavily customized font. \r\nFORESTBOUND: part of /O, it has a
    \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/trade+gothic|Trade Gothic Condensed]]\" feeling
    to me. So may be starting from it, make it thinner (to keep /O shape of the Condensed
    version), stretching and manually rounding it could do the job. I would probably
    start from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-sans|Benton Sans Condensed]],
    redrawing /O (from /U) and doing the same work as previously described. For the
    laziest, there's also (breathe...) [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic-next-soft-rounded|Trade
