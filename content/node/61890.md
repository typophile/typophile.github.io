  has made available perhaps?) to rename glyphs in FLS5?\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like
  to find a way where I can rename glyph X and (i) have the glyph name changed in
  the code and classes, and (ii) have all glyphs named X.* changed as well. (i) is
  easy enough, but I don't know of any simple way to achieve (ii) that doesn't involve
  manually renaming all of the glyphs involved.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Try [[http://www.adhesiontext.com/typophile/GlyphRenamer.zip|GlyphRenamer]].
    All it requires is a text file with two columns of names separated by white space
    (can be one or more space characters or tabs). So something like,\r\n\r\n<code>oldName1
    \   newName1\r\noldName2    newName2\r\noldName3    newName3</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    script will only rename glyphs. It won't change the glyph names used in Classes
    or OT features."
