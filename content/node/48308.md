body: "I just joined the site, and have a question about how everyone buys their type.\r\n\r\nI
  have a single person studio, and for things like software and hardware, I just buy
  them outright, while for stock media (photos, audio, etc) I mark up and bill to
  the client (since they are project-specific). How does everyone handle it with type?
  What do you charge clients for a new face bought for a project? Type has the added
  wrinkle that you have to buy it before you use it... there's no way to 'comp' with
  type without paying for it. So you're taking a risk just to present an option. Because
  of these things, I have largely stuck with my base collection of classics. But I'm
  wanting to branch out more.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: The answer may relate to the services you're selling to your clients. Perhaps
    you could describe typical projects.

  body: "It depends a lot on your clients. Some can afford the type and don\u2019t
    bat an eye at the addition of $300 to their bill, but when the cost of the type
    increases the bill by a third clients are going to start complaining. "

  body: I typically do web and multimedia work, but also some print. I have done identities
    (always for smaller clients) as well. An ident project seems like the most obvious
    spot, but then I have to show multiple options, and buying multiple faces just
    for options is kind of iffy. I don;t do long-form print (books, ARs), so , while
    those would also be prime candidates (I think) they are not on the table.

  body: ">An ident project seems like the most obvious spot, \r\n\r\nTwo thoughts
    - most foundry/distributor sites have online type-testers so there's no reason
    you can't do basic comps. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the client is probably going to need
    a license to the font themselves, so maybe look at vendors that allow license
    transfers, and then pass on the font at cost (+ your usual markup) along with
    the designs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    as your other software and hardware investments. Come up with an annual budget
    and increase your hourly rate to cover it. '
