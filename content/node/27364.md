body: I'm looking for a serif typeface that is as thorough as TheSerif or PMN Caecilia
  -- i.e., multiple weights, small caps, true italics, ranging figures, etc -- but
  that isn't TheSerif or PMN Caecilia. I can't use TheSerif (long story why) and I
  can't shake the feeling that PMN Caecilia is just a bit too precious (humanist)
  for this particular use. I'm tending toward slab(ish) serifs, but open to other
  suggestions, too. Any thoughts?

  body: You know what, Stefan, I'll second that. I bought Luminance recently (but
    not Remonoire - that's for later) and I must say, it's a very warm, unique and
    legible face. It works beautifully, so much character, but such that it doesn't
    overwhelm. Nice work!

    on a slow burn so I haven't committed to anything yet. Was just looking at TheAntiqua...
    Man, she's pretty...

  body: Freight Micro has all that. It has a great italic too, really similar in some
    ways to the very first italics. All the other weights and styles are a plus as
    well.

  body: "NiceTry beat me to it. Freigh Micro has everything you need. There is a lot
    of character there - maybe too much for what you need? - but it's totally style-linked,
    with a very rich character set and everything you need in terms of numerals. I'm
    trying to convince my employer to buy it and Freight Sans; it's not inexpensive,
    but I think the price is worth it. You can really see how much work Joshua poured
    into it.\r\n\r\nJLT\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com : rnrmf!"
