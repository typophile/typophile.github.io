  &#40;yes -- all of them&#41; used in the United State Passport. <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41;
  Is there a type face that matches the &#39;federal&#39; face? I know that letterror
  has &#39;Federal&#39; -- BUT, it only works with Mac. Any other suggestions. <BR>
  <BR>P.S. This isn&#39;t some sort of False ID making scam <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: It&#39;s quite different to figure this out without any samples. Many of us
    are not U.S. citizens, and even the ones that are don&#39;t necessary have a passport
    to look at. <BR> <BR>So, please, scan some samples and post them here.

  body: Kyle,  <BR> <BR>I believe you that this isn&#39;t a scam, but anyone in the
    world can read the posts on this forum. So, in principle, any ID&#39;s to try
    to help counterfeit anything should be avoided. I have refused to attempt to locate
    similar typefaces for type from what seemed to be official documents, whether
    it was stamps, serial numbers or the type itself. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if
    this Board has a policy about that, but in my opinion it should.  <BR> <BR>As
    far as Federal only working with Mac, anyone with Fontographer,  Fontlab&#39;s
    TransType, or the like, can convert from Mac to PC. That should be no problem.
    &#40;If you have the font, I&#39;ll make the conversion for you.&#41;

  body: Mike, you are propably right about this. It wouldn&#39;t be very wise to tell
    people what fonts could be used to forge a passport on a public forum.  <BR> <BR>We
    don&#39;t want to read in newspaper how someone did something stupid using a fake
    passport and how he/she found the correct typefaces on an Internet message board...
    <BR> <BR>Everyone here &#40;Kyle included&#41; are propably just interested in
    typography, but you never know... <BR> <BR>If someone knows the passport-types,
    he/she might e-mail them to Kyle.

  body: My firm is doing a &#34;Mock Passport&#39; marketing piece. <BR> <BR>I guess
    I didn&#39;t give second thought to this issue. I really only spoke of it in a
    joking manner. Maybe its just me, but I don&#39;t see the harm. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    but not identical. IMHO ... just like the new $20, the passport is ultra ugly. '

  body: Kyle, in these days of homeland security you could be making yourself a target
    of some FBI paranoid operative. I mean geese they are requiring photo IDs from
    our friends from South America now. Just have your writer use official sounding
    language, use boring colors, and lots of helvetica and you&#39;ve got it. &#40;also
    use some funky background pattern screened back to 10%&#41;

  body: Thats the basic idea. I just need it to say, Ohh.. passport. ya know? Wasnt
    trying to cause any FBI red flags ;&#41; I could start printing money, like on
    &#39;Catch me if you Can&#39;, and then stope the press, and have tons of already
    diecut money come flying out of a press. Where were the continuity directors on
    that one <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
