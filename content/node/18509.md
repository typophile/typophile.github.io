    gap in the R) might be obscured due to the printing process.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: It looks alot like Bernhard gothic, was going to post that earlier, but that
    R has me stymied, also the G in the medium weight is shaped a little differently,
    could be the light stroked which would explain the no gap in the R.

  body: "It's not Bernhard Gothic, but most likely a knockoff. The BG medium 'M' has
    slant stems,  and the 'A' in the sample matches the lighter weight, not the medium.
    Some of the letters also appear to be slightly extended like the 'C' which isn't
    round as in BG.\r\n\r\nGeorge\r\n\r\nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until
    I met a man who had no Bodoni"

    being BG Light with a stroke added.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
