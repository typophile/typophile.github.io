body: Okay, we&#39;ve all seen this behavior, where a line in a large point  <BR>size
  has much more space in front of it than lines set in smaller  <BR>sizes. Is there
  a good reason why fonts should do this? Why is  <BR>there any space left before
  characters on a line? <BR> <BR>Look how difficult it is to get a nice alignment
  here. &#40;These  <BR>screenshots are from Illustrator, but the same thing happens
  in  <BR>InDesign and Quark.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52280.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>A&#41; I know that type designers consider the space before and  <BR>after
  characters when they setup kerning metrics, but is there a  <BR>way to avoid this?
  What is it about the way fonts are built that  <BR>leaves this unwanted behavior?
  <BR> <BR>B&#41; Are there fonts that exist that don&#39;t have this problem? And
  <BR>does the spacing in these fonts &#40;if they exist&#41; create other  <BR>problems
  because of it?

  body: When I designed JFP&#39;s type specimen I accidentally on purpose made it
    very alignment exact. I ended up using the line indentation a lot. You might also
    try a left indent. Maybe?

  body: This is a question of spacing, not kerning. The left margin includes the left
    sidebearing of the glyph in question. In InDesign and Illustrator, you can get
    around this to some degree by choosing optical margin alignment. If the font had
    OpenType optical bounds info, and an application used that, it could also help.
    <BR> <BR>However, there isn&#39;t a reasonable way around this in terms of the
    actual spacing of the font. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Left sidebearings are important for good spacing. Sorry.  :-/ <BR>Fonts that
    don&#39;t have this &#34;problem&#34; are simply not well spaced. <BR>And of course
    the larger the point size the larger a sidebearing comes out. <BR> <BR>But I see
    where you&#39;re coming from, and I can think of one way of addressing it, although
    it&#39;s peculiar: a font can have an invisible dummy character, and kerning pairs
    for every single combination of it and another character, where the pair value
    &#34;removes&#34; the left sidebearing. It&#39;s not as bad as it sounds, actually
    - in fact I guess you could even do it with Quark&#39;s pair-adding facility or
    something, although you&#39;d first have to open the font and record all the left
    sidebearings &#40;and you still have to account for overshoots, like you want
    the &#34;O&#34; to be pulled back more than its &#34;raw&#34; sidebearing, otherwise
    it won&#39;t align visually&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'Heh, it gets even better: <BR>Pay somebody &#40;hint, hint&#41; to write
    a Python macro that adds the invisible dummy character and all its kerning pairs
    to an existing font, and saves out a new AFM file &#40;all you&#39;d need to replace&#41;
    in seconds. You could even write a Quark &#40;or whatever&#41; macro to replace
    linebreaks with linebreak&#43;invisibledummyaligner so you don&#39;t strain your
    fingers. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <BR>I know there are good reasons for this problem to exist, just  <BR>wondering
    how others work around it. <BR> <BR>It looks like Indy&#39;s optical margin alignment
    only gets you part  <BR>way there... I noticed that with some fonts it makes no
    noticable <BR>change and with others it helps more. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/52286.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Tiff, could you describe your method more thouroughly? Do
    you  <BR>setup paragraph style sheets with negative indent settings? Do  <BR>you
    use the text frame &#34;inset&#34; settings?

    method sounds like a great one.

  body: If it&#39;s just for the headline/subhead combo I normally modify the spacing
    in type&#62;story&#62;optical margin alignment -also like when dealing with hanging
    punctuation- and save it as one of my styles. <BR> <BR>This is just indy, of course.
