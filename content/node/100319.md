  body: "It looks like <strong>Delphian Regular</strong> by Robert Hunter Middleton
    (1928), currently available from <strong>[[http://www.linotype.com/148212/delphianregular-font.html|Linotype]]</strong>
    in Mac Postscript Format\r\nThere was also an older version from Agfa named <strong>Delphian
    CG</strong> but I can't find any legitimate source to acquire it.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    It's also available from <strong>[[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/delphian/regular|Monotype]]</strong>
    in both Windows & Mac Postscript format\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"
