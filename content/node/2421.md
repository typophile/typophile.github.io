  TypeTool 2 on Mac OS 9 and up until tonight everything worked fine. I&#39;ve added
  kerning pairs and wanted to test them, but when I use &#34;generate mac suitcase&#34;
  to create a usable font, my applications won&#39;t recognize it &#40;I&#39;m putting
  them directly in the fonts folder&#41;. Any help would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>In
  case it isn&#39;t obvious, I&#39;m fairly new at this. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: He&#39;s on OS9, Hrant. <BR> <BR>Addison, are you trying to make PC type 1
    fonts or Mac type 1?  Because PFM and AFM/INF files are only used on the PC.

  body: Well, I have no idea what happened, but it works now. Perhaps there&#39;s
    a problem with my computer -- sorry for the false alarm. <BR> <BR>BTW, I have
    a Mac font from the Storm Type Foundry and it includes an AFM file. Why is that?
    <BR> <BR>Oh, and Chris, I&#39;m creating Mac type 1 fonts. <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    the help, <BR>Addison <BR>

  body: AFM files are used almost exclusively in &#42;nix now.  Maybe they can install
    Mac fonts with the AFM. <BR> <BR>I wish I could&#39;ve helped more, but at least
    you got it working now.

  body: 'Sorry to bring up this old thread, but I&#39;m having this same problem again.
    Here&#39;s the info: <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using TypeTool 2 on Mac OS 9 and X, plus
    TypeTool 2 for Windows XP. On all of these platforms, the &#34;Generate Mac Suitcase&#34;
    or &#34;Generate Font/Type 1&#34; fails to produce a working font. It always appears
    empty, if that makes sense. For instance, in OS 9 the suitcase icon is there,
    but when I try to open the suitcase and view the bitmaps, they display as Charcoal
    &#40;system font&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve posted a thread on the MSN/Fontlab messageboard
    twice, but I get no response. Does anyone here have any suggestions? For what
    it&#39;s worth, if someone can help me, I&#39;ll give them a copy of my font when
    it&#39;s finished &#40;if anyone actually wants it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance,
    <BR>Addison'

  body: Apparently if the FOND ID is set to 0, you cannot generate a font--in case
    you want to know. I&#39;m not sure how or why I changed it, but that was extremely
    frustrating. <BR> <BR>-Addison
