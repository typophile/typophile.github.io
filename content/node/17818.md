  Magazine. The font was changed recently.\r\n\r\nThe closest I've come so far is
  ITC Conduit, but there are still quite a few differences.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gee1.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gee2a.jpg]"

  body: First I've seen of Die Gestalten, formlos. How did you find them? They have
    a few questionable fonts like the really bad <a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/Radio/mudTyper+Weights/">Radio</a>
    copy, <a href="http://www.die-gestalten.de/fonts/detail/?id=402881820693de75010693deb83000be">Pemba</a>.

  body: "Yea, I think Yves and I mentioned these before <em>( 'Blender' VS 'Gridnik',
    'Pemba' VS 'Radio', 'Hannover Millennial' VS 'Bell Centennial' )</em>, thats also
    why I posted my little remark about the 'niceness' of the typeface, in relation
    to the 'inspiration' by Lineto\r\n\r\n<em>( 'Die Gestalten' is a pretty famous
    publisher of design books over here, especially in Germany, and they sure have
    to have their own type foundry division, as well :)</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "Funny, I just made a brief [[Die Gestalten Verlag]] wiki entry post yesterday.
    I must say I'm not the biggest fan of their fonts. I don't know how that came
    about. But they do make great books\u2026 [[House Industries]]' 10-year retrospective
    is from them, isn't it?"

  body: Die Gestalten clearly states that Blender was inspired by a design by Wim
    Crowel, which also happens to be the same source of inspiration as The Foundry's
    Gridnik. I actually like Blender, it's more subtle, but I can see a little too
    much of Radio in Pemba. I'm attaching a comparison of Gridnik (in black) vs Blender
    (in gray). They are definitely very similar.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blendnik.jpg]
