    titles as in logos, thanks Olli\r\n> Thanks Stefan, the reason I asked is that

    thanks for you help\r\n\r\nI'd post the image but 'alas' I am at home and not
    work. \r\nFive days you work\r\nOne whole day to play\r\nCome on everybody, wear
    your rollerskates today\r\nIt's Saturday, Saturday\r\n\r\n--N"
