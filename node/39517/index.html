<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So, I just started a webstore @ [[http://www.blissfulcouture.com]]. We sell luxury goods at discount prices. The target audience is women of all ages. The savvy internet shopper would probably be the main demographic; the ability to recognize a deal should influence one's decision to purchase at our site.
So, most luxury logos I see are simple - text on solid backgrounds, etc. I would like the same for ours but I'm curious as to what I'd be looking to do. Obviously our current logo (if it can be called that) is awful and we need to do something pronto.
Any help is appreciated.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was thinking (before I even looked at your wordmark) the name looks as if it would be nice in a Spencerian Script. You guys beat me to it. I think the only change that could be made would be to not have a Rasterized image of the wordmark. Also create an initialized version of the type, i.e. "BC". Also mess around with the composition and placement of the words "blissful" and "couture".</div>

<div class=commentbody>A few more possibilities:
:: Avoid the bevel effect on the flag for the language options. It takes away from the premium look a bit.
:: Probably not have the menu run so close to the logo. Would it be an idea to relocate it horizontallly in a slim strip below the black band?
:: Could take the currency and brand selectors also into the lower band to avoid clutter on the top of the page.
:: A relatively large image, some kind of headline, or even a fine pattern on the home page may set the tone of the brand. Right now it seems to get transactional too soon. Even if they are dicounted, you may still want to communicate that they are luxury products.

<div class=commentbody>At the very least re-make the images for the menu and the header, they look a bit rough. Or change the menu to text instead. I also notice the center header is not flush with the sidebars. Another possible change would be making the image box a standard height, regardless of image size. This would lock the product pages into a uniform grid, rather than where it waves up and down depending on product images

<div class=commentbody>Oops. Just noticed that Tony was looking for suggestion on the logo, not the website as such :(
Frankly, it's not a script face I particularly like. Even here it's a bit all over the place.
Yeah, your right. Luxury brands generally have just beautiful type nicely spaced. Besides, as a general rule of thumb, if the name is expressive, then keep the graphic simple. Blissful Couture even in this text, communicates a lot, so perhaps go for just a nice typeface. Warnock come to mind.
What may be really cool would be to use:
