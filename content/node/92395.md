body: "Hi,\r\nI need to create an English/Russian publication for a company using
  Trade Gothic font family as their corporate typeface. I've found equivalents for
  the Regular, Regular Italic and Bold styles on ParaType website (namely [[http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?fcode=PT_NGT&letter=N|News
  Gothic]]) but am having difficulties finding replacements for the Extended and Bold
  Extended styles. Do you know any other Cyrillic typeface that could be used as a
  replacement to Trade Gothic, with regular <em>and</em> extended widths? Many thanks."
