  body: i also figured it was woodcut. but i thought perhaps it was suppose to be

  body: Usually it's the other way around. Some original wood type faces made it to
    digital, but I've never heard of any wood type face mimicking a digital font.
    Well, apart from <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=80">FF Meta
    Wood</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=141">Chaparral
    Wood</a>, but that's a different story.
