  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">There is a wealth of experience and documentation about testing, adjusting the spacing, kerning and hinting of Latin type. [[Arabic]] has a radically different sript structure - many letters are connected, dots and marks are significant design elements, and there is a lot more variation in the shapes of glyphs within one font. Software like FontLab are geared to Latin fonts for example there is no way to test Arabic using such rules of thumb as the XOX or HOH strategies. You are invited here to share your experience in dealing with these particular aspects of Arabic fonts, with thanks.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>For a typical horizontal Arabic type, I think a similarity of approach between Latin and Arabic can be found in beginning with the spacing of upright letters, i.e. alif and lam. Start with a run of isolated alif glyphs and space them so that the overall colour produced by the rhythmic repetition of black and white is neither too heavy nor too light. In Latin type, one generally starts with letters with strong uprights but also internal white space, such as H and n, but the internal white space of Arabic letters tends to be more variable, so at this initial stage I would work with simple upright forms.</p>
<p>اااااا</p>
<p>Once the isolated alif has been spaced, this gives you a guide for the left side of the final alif and the right side of the isolated and initial lam. The next step is to space the medial and final form of lam and make the connections of the appropriate length, again using the isolated alifs as a visual guide.</p>
<p>اااللل</p>
<p>The right side spacing of the medial and final lam provide a guide for the right side of the final alif. You now have a set of guide glyphs between which you can test the spacing of left-right connecting letters, e.g.</p>
<p>ااالهاااا</p>
<p>As with Latin spacing, the more glyph combinations you space, the more pairs you have against which you can check new combinations or refine previous spacing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>PS. The spacing of a lot of Arabic typefaces is really bad, so trying to find good models can be difficult. We spend a lot of time on spacing (and also kerning of non connecting letters), and I think the Adobe Arabic fonts are worth looking at in this regard.</p>
<p>A major issue re. kerning is interaction between tightly spaced letters and vocalisation marks, which need to be contextually resolved to avoid unwanted collisions. Traditionally, this is done by shifting the marks, rather than by adjusting the spacing of the letters. I think that in a typographical environment, both techniques are valid, and can be used side-by-side and even in combination. However it is done, this is major work and one of the least attractive aspects of the OpenType approach to Arabic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you John. This is very helpful. Common and sensible advice for spacing Latin is to try to equalize the spaces within the outlines with those between the letters. In other words the line of text should have an even texture and &lsquo;color&rsquo;. This is not always possible in Arabic- for example a downward-curving ra will always leave a void above it, while a tightly knotted initial heh will always look dark however one spaces it. 
هرانت
Of course this effect will vary from font to font, and can be lessened with kerning. But generally-speaking why not simply accept this basic variability in the visual density of a line of Arabic text? Aesthetic and reading comfort considerations aside, this may well prove to be an in-built aid to legibility.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I wrote, &lsquo;the internal white space of Arabic letters tends to be more variable&rsquo;, so you can&rsquo;t use the internal white space as a guide to inter-letter spacing as one can, to a certain extent, with Latin. This is why I start with the simple upright letters, because they enable one to establish a basic rhythm within which the more complex shapes can be optically spaced. In Latin script there are also letters, such as a and s, that can only be spaced by eye within the general rhythm established by other letters; in Arabic, there are simply more such letters.</div>

<p>&hellip;and even more so between one calligraphic style and another, and their equivelant manifestations in various fonts.  For example in riq&rsquo;a scrip the loops of letters like waw, ain, feh and so on are all closed, and a line of such script (or font) will have a rather spindly thorny appearance.  On the other hand more geometrical Arabic fonts with strong uprights and horizontal &lsquo;spine&rsquo; will appear more like a compact frieze pattern.  I think this is all fine, and other distinguishing patterns and textures will appear in the scripts and fonts of other languages . That is why I am wary of the recent &lsquo;matchmaking&rsquo; trend  where Arabic fonts are forced to lose their character by following the x-height and other features of Latin fonts.</p>
<p>Having said that I feel there must be common guidelines applicable to all fonts in any language- for example a rule of thumb comparing letter width and the space between letter-outlines? The minimum or maximum size of dots and other martks? Human vision is an amazingly sophisticated system, and reading a font is an act of seeing to which the basics of perception must apply whatever is being seen and read.</p>

<p>In my projects, I divide Arabic letters and glyphs into two groups based on their connectivity:  restricted and un-restricted.</p>
<p>Restricted letters can only connect from one side (Alif, Waw, Ra, Dal, ..) or never connect (Hamza). These glyphs need spaces on the left.</p>
<p>Un-Restricted letters can connect from both sides (the rest of the letters). No spaces are need for this group on either side.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Saad. I guess by spacing I meant the fine-tuning of these Restricted letter spaces.   For example if the alef width is considered as one unit, how many units of space would you give it? What if it were bold- do you make the aleph thicker but keep the space the same, or increase the space proportionally?</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Note that when talking about &lsquo;spacing&rsquo; in the context of Arabic, as should be plain from my comment earlier about spacing medial forms between initial lam and final alif, we need to consider both letters with actual space between them, e.g. waw followed by another letter, and also the relationship of connecting letters, i.e. the length of the connecting strokes. In the various classical styles of Arabic writing, these strokes are analysable as part of the fusion, i.e. as part of the letter in its appropriate form in a specific context. The advent of flat &lsquo;neo-naskh&rsquo; and other typographic styles with a horizontal baseline stroke introduces a more Latin-like spacing model, in which the connecting stroke is analysable independently of the letter as a kind of spacing. This is demonstrated in the illustration below, in which we can say that the connecting stroke to the left of the mim is too short,  and on the right it may be too long, i.e. that it is spaced too far to the left between the two upright letters. This could be a fault in the mim glyph, in the final alif glyph, in the initial lam, or any combination of the three. [Note that I messed with the spacing to produce this illustration; the actual font is not spaced like this.]</p>

<p>As John has demonstrated the the spaces between connected letters is as important as the space between unconnected ones. The figure above (using Segoe UI and some fun with Gimp) can be used to point out various aspects of spacing.</p>
<p>The colored areas are what I have been calling &lsquo;word shape&rsquo; (perhaps another term is used in typography courses?). This shape is defined both by the letter outlines and the spaces between them.  Arabic word shapes are irregular as compared to those of Latin, and arguably this helps legibility in Arabic because each word looks different than the other (an advantage erased by &lsquo;matchmaking&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Referring to the numbers in the figure I propose to use the term &lsquo;space&rsquo; for  1,2,4,5 defined by the distance between the edge of the letter and the left or right sidebearings. Perhaps &lsquo;baseline distance&rsquo; would be a good term for the distances defined by the length of the baseline in connected letters, such as in 3 (lam and meem). A &lsquo;gap&rsquo; would be the visual space such as 3 or 8 that is defined by the word-shape and it depends on the design of the letters, the baseline distances and spaces involved.</p>
<p>-In this font the spaces 1 , 2 and 7 are all different I wonder if this is intentional?
-The gap 3 will be large even if the baseline distances are tightened to the extreme.
-The space 5 is unavoidable in most Arabic fonts (if kerning is not used) - is that similar to what Aziz was saying about the dal?
-4 and 6 are the only spaces between words here. In the Latin the spaces between the words appear more prominent.
-Final letters like the yeh, seen sad etc. leave a large gap such as 8.</p>
<p>In a good font  the careful design of glyphs so that the gaps, spaces and baseline distances all combine to produce a pleasing balance.  What would your idea of a &lsquo;pleasing balance&rsquo; be? Examples of &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;bad&rsquo; fonts in this respect would be useful for discussion.</p>

<p>As I wrote previously: &lsquo;The advent of flat ’neo-naskh’ and other typographic styles with a horizontal baseline stroke introduces a more Latin-like spacing model, in which the connecting stroke is analysable independently of the letter as a kind of spacing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spacing is part of a trinity of factors, along with style and size, and isn&rsquo;t something to which I would describe myself as having &lsquo;an approach&rsquo;. The appropriate approach &ndash; or options for possible approaches &ndash; depends on the individual typeface.</p>

<p>True it all depends on the design, and perhaps the only way to space it correctly is to use an intuitive &lsquo;see for yourself&rsquo; approach.</p>
<p>The spacing S of an Arabic script or font whatever its style might be quantified as follows:
S= M/W<br>
where W is the typical width of a vertical letter like the alef, and M is the minimum horizontal distance between outlines in the font. For example in square kufi where the letter-width is exactly equal to the space between letters, S=1. In the texts above the space between alef and initial yeh (or the dot of the zain and the alef, or the dal and the alef) seem to have a typically minimum space between them.</p>
<p>Then, roughly-speaking, S=2 for the comfortably-spaced top line, S=1 for the middle and S=0.3 for the tightly squeezed bottom example.  I guess one can also use other measures for example A/W where A is the average space.</p>

<p>I think the worst disease that have struck good old poor Arabic script was the many  &ldquo;self-appointing&rdquo; prophets and guardians, complete with commandments and holly sermons! Reformers want to &ldquo;fix it&rdquo;, calli-typographers want to freeze it in time.</p>
<p>Here is my commandment: the spacier the airier; and here is my second commandment: space it at 16 point, see it at 6 points!  -:)</p>
<p>seriously, lets give theses Arabic letters a break. Calligrapher squeezed them, melted them, ligatured them, deprived them personality and independence, made art of them, claimed they were sacred .. This was (and still) fine and may be necessary IN CALLIGRAPHY . Still one thing the founding fathers of calligraphy did not do: they did not etch rules on stones, otherwise we would not have all these revoultionry different styles.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Saad! Your refreshing reminder that calligraphy and font design are (or should be) open to change, improvement and innovation is welcome. Over the centuries Arabic calligraphy has done very well for itself and the results are the fantastic &lsquo;polished&rsquo; styles of classical calligraphy, with all their in-built rules and traditions. Enter printing, and now the calligraphers feel threatened but the font-designers gradually realize that here was a new opportunity to innovate. Because of technical issues like font metrics, the visibility of displayed and printed words font designers have to explore new issues, for example spacing, and find solutions to them.</p>
<p>By the way the tight spacing Aziz advocates is not a necessarily bad thing. In Chinese and Japanese characters the density of strokes is very high in a given space, but it seems that the eye can read such character-words at one glance. The Arabic equivelant to these characters would be, for example, the basmala ligature.  Perhaps with such software as Tom Milo&rsquo;s Tasmeem where such overlapping of glyphs is possible and easy to control, old and new styles of &lsquo;tight&rsquo; Arabic can be displayed.</p>

<p>In the thread referred to by Aziz there is an image [[http://typophile.com/files/MRALLAH1.jpg|MRALLAH1]] of his font. I am not an expert of Koranic script, but I liked the elegance and smooth connectivity of the font. In some places it is too tight for example in the word كفار the kaf touches the feh. However in the word كزرع the ra and zain and kasratan fit beautifully within the curves of the ain.  In fact the marks everywhere fit very nicely within the outlines. Can you tell us more about this font family - its name, number of ligatures, kerning, hinting and other features. How long did it take you to develop? Congratulations with flowers.</p>

<p>Aziz, I am sure any fair person would give you high mark on your font (lets call it wurud - flowers-:) but I have only one problem with it: it is not yet a font that I can buy, and select from the font menu!  In other word: I agree with the question put by Vladimir, where is the beef?  Tell us more.</p>
<p>As for Tasmeem:</p>
<p>In defense of Milo&rsquo;s fascinating work, he has produced a <em>working</em> Arabic engine that can work as a desktop publishing software to print involved texts like historical works, complete with few involved and high end fonts.  Tasmeem is not a common commercial application like MS-Word targeting the general audience &hellip; at least not yet. One can agree with some of your points and disagree with others, but you have to keep in mind what Tasmeem is really targeting. Personally, I like to see Open Type flourishing for Arabic. I do not like to think of Decotype format as a replacement for it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Saad that there is room for both Tom&rsquo;s Tasmeem and Aziz' Open Type naskh. Once the user has access to both, either can be used according to availability, the level of control needed and platform used. As in Latin fonts there is always room for excellence, and healthy competition can benefit typography as a whole.</p>
<p>As I understand it Aziz has made an incredible labor of love to create a unique font family  (Wurud??) TTF (or OT?)  with artistry and precision. Let us call it a full-course naskh meal by a master chef. We look forward to the feast.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s Tasmeem work is an incredible labor of love consisting of the scholarly analysis of the roots of what he calls the grammar (the visual language) of Arabic writing systems and naskh in particular. This has been ingeniously implemented by the decotype team in software where such writing can be re-created naturally on the computer. In Tasmeem&rsquo;s naskh the user can control spacing and choose the details of various letters and markings. This flexibility applies to any other font adapted for the system, where it can be fine-tuned according to need or level of design experience. One might say Tom makes available a gleaming  futuristic kitchen; and (as soon as any techno-phobia has had a chance to wear off) guides us to effortlessly create a superb meal to taste.</p>
<p>Aziz gives flowers. Tom gives magic tulip bulbs to instantly grow your own.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Vladimir,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying this is such nice culinary metaphors. I love cooking, you could guess as you caught me the other day baking a loaf of bread and one day I hope to present you my version of felafel!</p>
<p>But after some soul searching, I had to come to the conclusion that I am more of model builder where Arabic is concerned. Models you normally make from fascinating objects like intriguing cars or famous  airplanes. Grammars are models of languages - mental exercises driven by fascination and curiosity, attempting structurally to understand and reproduce what can be observed. The object of analysis itself, language, is is taught by examples and learned by imitating. I felt that Arabic script should be approached from the same point of view: not as a capricious art-form irreverently called AC, but as a  communication system where senders and receivers over a period of many centuries successfully shared the code. In this approach historical Arabic script is understood as a tool for text manufacture with not so much learnability, but legibility as its primary characteristic.</p>
<p>Azizi Aziz,</p>
<p>Lemme try to clarify what that implies.</p>
<p>Naskh is a historical script style. We made a computer model of it. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>DecoType ACE is technology to make this possible (which incidentally was the proof of concept for OpenType). It is not naskh, but a programming environment we (for I am not doing this alone) developed over the years for projects like a naskh model - the ultimate challenge.</p>
<p>Tasmeem is Adobe In Design with ACE built into it by WinSoft, who, together with DecoType, designed a User Interface around ACE. With ACE, Tasmeem can handle any Arabic script style.</p>
<p>ACE was first conceived as early as 1982-83 to enable the creation of a ruq`a replica. As said, the result was not so much a font, but a computer model of ruq' a. It was licensed by Microsoft around 1993. It was Microsoft who asked us to do a naskh with the same method in 1995. But not after they had first asked us in 1991-92 to provide a realistic naskh solution within their very simple design template - but I suppose that&rsquo;s more a topic for the other thread.</p>
<p>InDesign is a typesetter&rsquo;s tool with enormous precision and many specialized controls - for Latin-based scripts. Some people just want it like that. With Tasmeem, we try to introduce this kind of precision into the field of Arabic script.</p>
<p>Against this background, Tasmeem provides the user with tools to adjust the positioning of points and vowels. And, it provides specialized kerning and tracking controls based on the structure of Arabic - which is I believe the subject of this thread.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s Tasmeem (nice alliteration, but it is really WinSoft&rsquo;s) and Aziz’ Open Type naskh are sooner complementary than mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Each is in it&rsquo;s own league.</p>

<p>The historical calligraphic script was not primarily about Legibility or learnability.  It was about speed and harmony. Read what one of the fathers of Caligraphy, Barmaki, said 1000 years ago:</p>
<p>الخط صورة روحها البيان، ويدها السرعة، وقدمها التسوية، وجوارحها معرفة الفصول</p>
<p>Translation: Calligraphy is a living picture, whose soul is representation, hand is speed, foot is harmony, and strength is the knowledge of derived styles.</p>

<p>My font Mehdi, which uses both Tatweel (kashida) (not today&rsquo;s common dash-like imitation) and Irsaal (final form tatweel) was implemented across 5 fonts with more that 2500 glyphs and plenty of glyph substitutions. In Tasmeem, less than 500 glyphs were needed.  Plus, users do not need to keep changing fonts and they have additional power and flexibilty. This was accomplished with a simple template on Fontlab with no letter chopping.</p>
<p>Also, Tasmeem can keep your flowers fresh: Users can not steal fonts since they can not work outside the environment.</p>

<p>Tom- nice alliteration here too ruq‘a replica! Was there just one stroke-like curve for each glyph (not a complete outline)and the program creates an outline from this curve according to a &lsquo;nib&rsquo; (qalam tip)  length and angle? Some reference graphics would be nice to see. Is r-r included in Tasmeem?  I guess it is time to start a Tasmeem thread here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s less. The total glyph complement of Mehdi is now 235 including punctuation and static Arabic characters. The ACE-driven set, that replaces the original 5000 with partial Unicode support is only 161 for full support (excluding Koranic tajweed).</p>

It is true that under Islam geometrical patterns and scripts were prized as a sophisticated  abstract art form. This led to illegible calligraphic styles that were enjoyed as decorative puzzles. At the same time it was a period of intensive scholarship when books on science, philosophy and theology were written by skilled scribes. For those books legibility would have been important. This lead to the highly legible naskh. Later for official Ottoman government documents the highly legible ruq&rsquo;a was adopted.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I feel reminded of a previous discussions about the goods and bads of DecoType/WinSoft’s InDesign plug-in Tasmeem, a layout engine for typesetting Arabic which uses a special font format. Thomas Milo usually presents its capabilities with help of a high-end typeface of a special style. (By the analysis of this style he arrived at the technology, but in the end the technology is suited for any other style too.) To my amusement or regret (depends on my mood) this provoked some critics to blame him for propagating this particular style which they consider outdated — and disregard the layout engine because of the style of the typeface used for presentations! A layout engine of course is “mere” technology and is ignorant of anything like designers’ sentiments.
Same is true for iKern. If you object to a Fell being kerned at all, then I had preferred if there were no “automated” in “applying automated spacing to pre-designed types”.  ;-)

If the left side bearing of all glyphs are set to zero, the right side bearing of alef would define the right side bearing of dal, reh waw and all no right joiner glyphs. And the same amount cut off from left of reh and waw (as a start) and half of that amount added to the right of alef (and its final form).

Can you provide a graphic or screen shot with large-size glyphs and bearings to illustrate your ideas?<br>
Would these rules of thumb depend on the vertical stem thickness of the letters?
In other words would you expand the spaces as the font gets bolder?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m in the middle of moving now. I&rsquo;ll expand this idea when I have time. But until then, suppose this:
FontLab adds an Arabic spacing tool which produce a preview of that string (it has to be expanded and include initial jeem for example).
All characters are initially set at zero side bearing on both sides (where applicable). Then you have a &lsquo;master&rsquo; side bearing glider that you can manually adjust the value of &ldquo;s&rdquo; as the value of side bearing. As you increase this value from initial zero, it is applied to all characters of that string with a coefficient number.
That coefficient number would be 1 for right side of all characters (except jeem for which it should be 1/2). And coefficient number for the left side should be zero for all, except reh and waw for which it should be -1 and for alef for which it should be +1/2.
Now as you slide the &lsquo;master&rsquo; spacing line, you stop where that string looks good! That&rsquo;s your spacing!
Aziz you are right. I&rsquo;m Persian that&rsquo;s why I usually use jeh in my string too, to make sure dots are not messed up!
This is my idea of spacing setting. I usually apply it to all characters, even assorted alefs. But we have not yet discussed in this topic about the &lsquo;kerning&rsquo; part, which I usually use to undue the damage after the spacing is being set.
So this scheme can be applied to any font, regardless of the thickness of the characters. Actually in my experience, bold fonts tend to need less spacing.</div>

I don&rsquo;t know if this picture can illustrate it or not. It&rsquo;s setting the spacing based on above mentioned scheme, and then do the corrections by kerning. BTW I don&rsquo;t know how to edit previously posted text and this &lsquo;undue&rsquo; in my previous post is getting on my nerves!.. Miss Tiffany, would you please undo the undue for me?!</p>
<p>You may notice that in picture sample, the right side bearing of alef is not following that 1/2 value of &ldquo;s&rdquo;. It is more. In some other faces, it should be less. The point is that you only have one single variant for spacing which is &ldquo;s&rdquo;. Then if you had &lsquo;side bearing classes&rsquo; for each, depending the font face, you&rsquo;d assign certain coefficient for the characters, the spacing adjustment can be controlled by variant &ldquo;s&rdquo; on one hand, and occasionally fine tuning the coefficient for side bearing class. I do this by creating normal classes, selecting and increasing and decreasing the side bearing. But it&rsquo;s hard to keep-up with every little changes you do in the value of &ldquo;s&rdquo;. I often ignore them and later regret!
A tool with those side bearing classes in which you can set the coefficient for the class is, for Arabic spacing, a tool made in heaven! also notice initial Khah (same thing as initial jeem etc.) has reduced spacing on its right. This is because the &lsquo;weight&rsquo; of the character which is toward the left, remain balanced despite the extended line to the right.
The picture is for a sample with and without kerning.
As you see, I use the same spacing for alef with madda above. And madda, particularly in Persian use, can be really substantial! but I ignore it in spacing. Same thing with what in Persian is called &lsquo;sarkash&rsquo; of kaf and gaf. I ignore them in setting spacing and I apply the side bearing based on its base body. Then I do the correction in kerning.
Lately I changed this method in my fonts because most browsers don&rsquo;t support kerning and as you see in the picture, the text without kerning correction can&rsquo;t survive. So now I do apply side bearing with considering &lsquo;sarkash&rsquo; and then in kerning, I apply negative value when applicable. But the first method is better (in a perfect world).
Hope it interest you,
Behnam</p>

<p>Exactly- one wants to see the verses written in Farsi. There is the famous manuscript at Oxford with the Rubaiyat. Are there any known examples of Omar Khayyam&rsquo;s own handwriting? Also the English I quoted is known to be too freely translated often changing the meaning.</p>
<p>Thanks behnam! Your &lsquo;dream software&rsquo; for spacing Arabic  sounds very interesting hope Fontlab is listening. In the sense that it lets you choose the spacing in a proportional way for all glyphs simultaneously, it sounds a lot like one function of DecoType&rsquo;s Tasmeem on InDesign ME.  Too bad many programs do not apply kerning, so the only practical way remains to do manual spacing as you showed.</p>

<p>Kerning is a font built-in feature. 
It is automatic in Adobe Arabic OTF.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, this is my contribution, for however wants to implement it in a tool!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been away from Iran too far and for too long to have any relevant information. But my instinct says that if the original manuscript of Khayyam existed, every single Iranian would have known it! In a region with a long history of far too many wars and far too many burnt cities and libraries, it is highly unlikely that we ever see the original manuscript of any great writer. But the manuscript of Oxford library seems to be one of credible references.
<a href="http://www.bestirantravel.com/culture/poetry/khayam_old.html">http://www.bestirantravel.com/culture/poetry/khayam_old.html</a>
Edward Fitzgerald, as you mentioned, was a poet who made poetry based on his inspiration of Khayyam. I guess this is the best way to put it, and perhaps the only way to translate Persian poetry. Khayyam could not be known in English literary if it was otherwise. So I personally don&rsquo;t see this free style of translation as a fallback.
Even in Persian, it was not uncommon for someone to reproduce the book of a great poet with adding one or two verses of his own, inspired by his greatness! This makes the task of authentication very difficult for researchers. But &lsquo;culturally&rsquo; speaking, this is not considered a forgery. It is considered a tribute to a great poet. If a verse is good enough to be Khayyam, it is Khayyam as far as I&rsquo;m concerned!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This is increasingly getting off topic Vladimir. But in two lines, I&rsquo;d say both Khayyam and Fitzgerald were praising hedonistic lifestyle, not as a goal, but as a vehicle to express some ideas about freedom of mind. Victorian era might be a good reason for Fitzgerald to be attracted to those ideas. When Khayyam talks about wine, he means that well known alcoholic beverage and not some symbolic medium to some spiritual pleasure that some people claim! These people can not face the fact that this great person was completely ignoring Islamic rules and was following his own mind. But Khayyam meant what he meant. A modern translation can only emphasis this. The spirituality is right there.</div>

..yes of course behnam.I once wondered whether this was OK in Typophile threads and was reassured that it is quite normal to go on all sorts of tangents in discussions. I now realize that part of the value of Typophile is to provide a place to relax from the rigors of font-making.  You may well be right about the earthiness of Khayyam&rsquo;s verse - but wine is spirit-ual however one reads it!  Still, one likes to see a translation free from Victorian sentimentality and the need to rhyme etc.</p>
<p>Going back to your idea for a spacing scheme I wonder if this is the sort of thing that can be implemented with Python scripts? My hope is that you and others will start new threads here, perhaps &lsquo;Arabic Features I&rsquo;d like to See in Fontlab&rsquo;. I would start it but do not want to appear to monopolize this space, so please feel free.

<p>I too believe this is the best course in handling spacing. I used this principle in my fonts by divining letters/glyphs (from connectivity aspect) to restricted (no right joiner included) and non-restricted.  Restricted get built-in spaces to avoid kerning. Non restricted are set to zero (or more if one design isolated glyph fonts) side bearing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, the idea is to minimize kerning by implementing a proper spacing from the get go. My main concern was applications and mediums which don&rsquo;t have sophisticated text rendering. Think of text messaging for example. But also, it seems that kerning chews a lot of CPU activities and slows down the process. I don&rsquo;t have scientific knowledge about it but in my experience it certainly feels that way.
So if we are designing fonts for high end publishing environment, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. But if the intention is a general purpose font, minimizing kerning to strict minimum is important.
As I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not a coder and have no knowledge about programming whatsoever. So I can&rsquo;t initiate a topic revolving the design of an Arabic script font tool. This is a very good idea though but it should be initiated by someone who actually intends to make a tool. Then we can all contribute and give our inputs for such project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re-reading Bahnam&rsquo;s suggestion, I see that we are probably not talking about the same thing. In my approach, all restricted letters/glyphs get extra spaces: those that do not join on left - like Raa, Dal, waw&hellip; - get extra built-in space on the left; And those that do not join at all -like Hamzah - get space on both sides.  This would apply to all shapes: initial, isolated and final.</p>
<p>Non restricted letters/glyphs are all the rest of the letters which can be either joined on both sides, one side, or be isolated, like Haa, baa, ayn, Faa, ..etc. These all get zero or one value side bearing. Again, this would apply to all shapes: initial, medial, isolated and final.</p>
<p>Kerning can then be applied to final shapes of restricted and some non-restricted letters like jeem &hellip;etc, depending on style, but it would not be required.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes I suspected that we were not applying the spacing the same way. But the point is that if we had an &ldquo;s&rdquo; variant and designated coefficient for side bearing classes, we could apply it anyway we want.
Having an equal spacing on the right side of all glyphs (where applicable) would ensure a better spacing (basic) setting for a character like reh, that could use a -1 coefficient for its left side and this cut-off portion would be absorbed by &ldquo;s&rdquo; value of the right side of any glyph which might be at the left side of reh. A +1/2 coefficient for the left side of alef (again, as a start) also is an important part of balancing the whole thing.</div>

<p>But the point is that if we had an “s” variant and designated coefficient for side bearing classes, we could apply it anyway we want.</p>

<p>Bahnam, Yes, this is the beneficial central point. Both of our approaches recognize the importance of designating &ldquo;side bearing classes&rdquo; to simplify the kerning task.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh this was just for the pattern demonstration. Kerning if applied in ltr preview will be applied in opposite side of the glyph. I don&rsquo;t know if it functions properly in rtl setting though. Because I made all my sample patterns in ltr setting, I stayed with it. A friend of mine made me a little application that reverse the kerning after the font is made. I vaguely remember that the kerning didn&rsquo;t work properly in rtl setting of the preview either. But this was about the version 4. I don&rsquo;t know about now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems that with FLS5 it works like it should.
There is an &lsquo;RTL&rsquo; button both in the Kerning Window and in the OpenType Feature section of the Preview panel. (Though not in the Preview section of this panel.) Since FLS5&rsquo;s internal logic for kerning and classes goes by &ldquo;1st and 2nd glyph of a pair&rdquo; (in RTL mode the 1st glyph of a pair is the right one), FLS5&rsquo;s kerning data can be transformed (almost) 1:1 into OT feature logic, e.g. with kern2volt. So it makes sense to use the Kerning Window&rsquo;s RTL mode when kerning Arabic.</p>
<p>But if you have a workflow with text patterns and tools already, then there&rsquo;s no need for change.</p>

There are two types of posts on Typophile, those that are flowerized by Aziz (or Azizified with flowers), and those that are not :) He is an expert font designer with many interesting ideas on Arabic fonts, sometimes expressed rather enigmatically!</div>
