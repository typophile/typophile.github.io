  body: "I second Kabel. Note that there are multiple versions that differ quite a
    bit (this would be ITC Kabel), and that your sample looks like it was strangely
    compressed horizontally.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the Book weight <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-kabel/\">here</a>,
    that looks right to me."
