  a bit of bonus video footage this month. As well as telling you about what's been
  happening on the site over the past onth I've posted some video and photographs
  that I took at the Great Yorkshire Show.\r\n\r\nThe Great Yorkshire Show is now
  the UK's biggest agricultural show and a great day out. As well as showing you some
  film of the horse shoe-making competition, there's a montage of photographs including
  one of The Duchess of Cornwall, aka Camilla Parker Bowles, Prince Charles's second
  wife.\r\n\r\nClick here to take a look at this month's video:\r\nhttp://j.mp/k5KA95\r\n\r\nAlso
  don't miss out on a superb run-through of British Print Trade Union cards, dating
  from 1946-1993.\r\n\r\nThis is a unique collection of typesetting union cards that
  reflect the different typographical styles of five decades.\r\n\r\nClick here to
  take a look:\r\nhttp://j.mp/mP6yna\r\n\r\nAll the Best\r\nDave Hughes\r\nYork, UK"
