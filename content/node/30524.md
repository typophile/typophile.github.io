  body: "As a designer for a Government Contractor, I can emphatically state that
    anything we (designers) do is an improvement over what's already in place. I would
    also encourage making as many visual improvements until someone says something.
    I'm constantly tweaking forms and factsheets that were created by some number
    cruncher using powerpoint. \r\n\r\n<strong>It brings up an interesting side question:</strong>
    <em>Should I feel ethically wrong if I tweak a non trademarked logo?</em> \r\n\r\nI'm
    constantly working with Government and Military logos that are either exist as
    small raster images, or as a horribly outdated and poorly created vector EPS.
    On more than one occasion, I've had to re-vectorize one or more of these logos
    for a project. I'd take the opportunity to then \"tweaked\" them, typography and
    all. "

    whomever you are working for that you have to redraw it, and mention what you
    want to tweak. They probably won't care, but at least you'll have their permission
    to do so.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    definitely a bastardized form of Helvetica Neue. <em>wait a sec, isn't Helvetica
    an Apple system font?</em>\r\n\r\nAs a Government Contractor; we work WITH the
    Government, not FOR the Government. I have a pretty decent collection of NON system
    fonts and use them as often as possible when \"recreating\" documents passed to
    me.\r\n\r\n "
