body: "We hit this technical support question recently, and thought others might like
  to be aware of it. One of our SBL Hebrew users reported that his existing Powerpoint
  documents were broken when he updated to the latest version of the font, despite
  the fact that the font works correctly elsewhere and he can also create new Powerpoint
  documents correctly. It turns out that Powerpoint stores glyphs by glyph index in
  slide/preview mode, and will not automatically refresh if you install a new version
  of the font with different glyph ordering. Thankfully, there is an easy fix for
  this one: the user has to open each slide of the document in edit mode (by double-clicking
  on it). This will refresh the glyph display.\r\n\r\nSo if you are providing updates
  to fonts that include changes to the glyph set indexing you might want to alert
  Powerpoint users that they will need to refresh their documents. I can imagine a
  user getting very upset if he stood up infront of an audience to give a presentation
  only to find all his slides broken because he installed a new font or was running
  his presentation from a machine that had a different version of the font."

    that's probably why we've not experienced this problem ourselves. I'll raise this
    with the PPT guys.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n"
