  body: "I wasn't meaning to attack you Timo. But I must say that if I saw these two
    logos, and wouldn't know what either of them is, I would in fact assume these
    two companies are affiliated, without any mean thoughts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixelmatrix_3607.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/designbits_5031.png]\r\n<em>\"I
    can\u2019t see any similarity between the pixelmedia logo and my version, except
    that both contain pixels.\"</em>\r\n\r\n1) In both logos, the central idea is
    how the pixel mark plays with negative space \r\nto \"reveal\" the initial letter
    of the company's name.\r\n\r\n2) Both logos include said pixelated mark; the company's
    name in all lc; \r\nand a subline in all UC.\r\n\r\n3) The layout / order (Anordnung)
    of these elements is extremely similar. \r\nThe pixel mark appears on the left;
    brand name to the right of it, more or less horizontally centered; subline below
    that, flush right. Even the size relations \r\nare pretty similar.\r\nIf you think
    of the gazillions of ways the individual elements of a logotype \r\ncan be arranged,
    this similarity in layout <em>is</em> surprising. Have you tried laying out your
    logo in a different way? Making the pixel mark larger, centering the brand name
    under it \u2013 or any of the numerous other options out there?\r\n\r\n4) You're
    obviously also trying to get the type to feel pretty much similar as in the original,
    which needless to say does a lot for their \"visual closeness\".\r\n\r\n5) From
    a copywriting perspective, the subline follows the exact same logic (Design /
    Web Design), which probably makes these two logos feel even more like being for
    two subsets of the same company.\r\n\r\n6) It doesn't help dissuade the notion
    of overt similarity that you chose very similar colors to the original logo (dark
    blue background, white type in the brand name, and the same color for the most
    part of the pixel mark and the subline, thus tying these two elements together).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
    just suspecting you may be glued to this \"inspirational\" logo too closely. Break
    free, play around! The pixelmatrix logo is nice, doubtless \u2013 but you're a
    different company. \r\nNo offense."
