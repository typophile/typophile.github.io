  body: "wow, thanks alot guys for your help! but i'm not quite finding what i'm looking
    for. if you take a look at the lower-cases, especialy \"e\", you'll find that
    they're somewhat condensed and have much more straight lines then the ones you've
    suggested. the book is from the 1870's if that could be of any further help. i've
    been looking around the net in the art nouveau and the arts and crafts sections,
    but without any luck.\r\n\r\nanyway \u2013 thanks again for your time,\r\n\r\ncheers!"

      that's true \u2013 but i need to have some more references to model them on.
      \r\n\r\nanyway, the ones you've suggested are quite near what i'm looking for,
      so thanks alot for your help tim!\r\n\r\ncheers"
