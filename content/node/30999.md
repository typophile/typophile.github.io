body: "FontLab's Font Auditor supposedly flags \"inflections\". The manual says that
  \"it is better to replace such curves with two curves.\" The accompanying picture
  shows an 's' curve like this: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/S curve_4013.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  wrote \"supposedly flags\" because I don't really see them flagged by Font Audit,
  though that option is checked in the 'options' window. (Extrema without points are
  flagged, but that it seems is another matter.)\r\n\r\nNow it is convenient to use
  'S' curves since that is what you can do with a Bezier curve that you can't do with
  a quadratic spline. \r\n\r\nWhat harm is done by inflections? Is it a question of
  functioning of the font? Of aesthetics? What is the issue here, if any? "

  body: "From the dusty bowels of my memory, I seem to recall that it is only a hinting
    issue and that it may be difficult to hint such curves properly. Once again my
    warning--the deepest dark corners of Chris's mind may not recall as acurately
    as they should :-)\r\n\r\nThat being said. I am surprised that FontAudit did not
    flag the above curve for missing extremma.  If you draw such a curve rotated so
    that there are no missing extremma points, you have the normal middle section
    of an \"s\" situation.  I often use this technique when drawing an s. I may later
    tweek it a tad by adiing a midpoint for more control but generally get as close
    as I can without the midpoint.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Font audit did flag extrema in my graphic--before I switched it off--but did
    not flag the inflection. Even if points were at both extrema, the inflection would
    still be there. This problem, if it is one, doesn't seem to be mentioned elsewhere...
