body: "G-Type is Nick Cooke's Foundry\r\n\r\nNick Cooke started his typographic journey
  as a lettering artist, in London, in 1982, crafting type by hand for book jackets.
  Working with David Cox (the great nephew of Eric Gill) was for him an apprenticeship
  into acquiring an appreciation of letterforms and proportions.\r\n\r\nInvolved in
  the digital type eversince computers made it to the mainline, he began to experiment
  with designing complete typefaces using Fontographer. His first type family \u2019Penguin\u2019,
  developed while working for Prima magazine, was accepted by Fontshop International
  in 1995. His second type family, an one-off script font \u2019ITC Dartangnon\u2019
  was produced in a similar manner at his next place of employment.\r\n\r\nHis independent
  career started soon after, as Fontworks UK started comissioning him custom typefaces
  for their clients. Later on, following his suggestion, they were more than happy
  to market his proprietary designs under the G-Type Foundry name. So, he started
  the G-Type foundry in 1999 to develop innovative and original - but most importantly,
  usable typefaces.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke is still doing comissioned work for Fontworks
  UK as well as custom type and lettering for his own clients.\r\n\r\nCreation Dates:\r\n\r\nFF
