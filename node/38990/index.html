  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My partner and I have been discussing moving out of Toronto for about a year now and we have decided moving somewhere in Europe would be ideal. He was born in Greece and speaks the language and has a lot of cultural ties there still so really wants to move back to Athens. I was born in Canada and my Greek is not -that- good and although this wouldn't be happening for at least another year and I would have time to work on it, is there really any chance of finding work in the design industry there if I don't speak the language fluently? Is it like that all over Europe? 

My partner and I both work as Art Directors in interactive departments of advertising agencies.

I know there are a lot of European designers here who could maybe provide some insights for me. I really don't want to move to London.</div>

For food it would be my first choice, for living conditions it would be pretty far down the list of European cities.

I've been told that European countries look at North American Degrees rather highly. Could I use this as leverage even though I don't speak another language fluently.

It's modern. Not nearly as modern as Berlin but pleny hooked up.

There's lots of large companies so I'm sure there's pleny of work. The local joke is that the Germans own all of them.

The language seemed completely foreign to me. I have been in most of western Europe and there were almost always parts of the language I could understand but not there, or Scandinavia. The written language seems like it would definitely take some time.

I don't know exactly what you do but my job requires idiomatic knowledge of language, that's one of the hardest things to aquire and it takes the longest.

My friends from Berlin all want to leave now. They say it's getting a lot more stressful living there. It's a shame.

All I can say from LA is welcome to the club. :)

The Basques live on some of the best real estate on this earth. Bilbao perhaps?

Designer I work with is from Athens but she says might be difficult not speaking the language although not impossible in the larger ad agencies. Scandanavia always appealed to me.

		<div class="commentbody">There are quite a few non-Finnish speakers here in Helsinki, and I think it would be possible to work in design without knowing the local languages. I know people who've been here for decades and still don't/won't speak the language. Houses are good and warm, infrastructure ok, air pretty clean and lots of nature around, even beaches. Downside is the climate, at the moment it's snowing and we won't see much sun for a few months from now. Summers are nice. As for swimming – my local beach offers a nice maintaned hole in the ice during the Winter months, so it's possible to swim in the sea around the year...

Actually, I suppose it's not that different to Toronto, except it's in Europe, there's the sea and people speak strange languages.

I lived in Munich for a year, and it was lovely. I was there only as a Hausfrau, it wouldn't have been possible to get a design job with my poor German skills. A Central European location is a good idea, if you want to visit other countries easily. From Munich we wisited Austria, Italy and Switzerland by train – very convienient.</div>

Why not Istanbul? I've been living here for more than 3 years. There's a huge amount of foreigners, including greek and canadians. Foreigners here are making an awful lot of money, providing they are good at what they do. Language is not a problem, there is a lot of work in graphic design, urban life is awesome, quality of life rather good, europe is an hour and a half away by plane, religion is not invasive.

so, i dont know - think about it.

I visited Istanbul on holiday a few years ago and fell in love with it and want to go back so badly. I was wondering how easy a move it was for you? Visa/job hunting/etc? The extent of my Turkish is basically "Bir chai, lutfen!", so I would need to bone up on that =)</div>

moving was not easy, i guess it never is anyway, to start a new life from scratch in a country you don't know. before thet i have been living 10 years in new york, 1 year in tokyo and 4 years in paris, but this was very different. it takes time to get fully used to this city, about 6 month. after that, its really very nice. to obtain a visa is very tricky and long, depending on your country: for french people, for example, you have to ask the working visa before you actually go and work there; that's really boring. i dont know for other countries, but french citizens can go and stay in turkey without any visa for 90 consecutive days, which is a blessing: you can go hunt for jobs, eventually find one, and ask the company's lawyers to get your visa (as in the USA), making things much faster done. job hunting is not very hard: just buy the newspaper hurriyet on sundays, that's where 95% of the ads are posted. you also might try a spontaneous job request by contacting the agencies here, there is a crazy amount of advertising / graphic design companies, both local or international. in 70% of the time, their creative directors or top art directors are foreigners. if your portfolio is good, they will call you, believe me. 3 major companies called me in the week following my emailing, 3 years ago, and it is still true today.

and to finish with the turkish language... i'm ashamed to say that my turkish sucks, still now. i can chat, order food, talk about graphic design specifics... but that's pretty thin. i am even married to a turkish girl, but we speak english and she is learning french... so, dont be too much afraid: language is not too much of a problem (until you get in a taxi of course).

		<div class="commentbody">I lived in Germany from 2001–2002, and then again from 2003–2007. Now I'm at Reading in the UK, but I'll be returning to Germany in late 2008. Both times in Germany, I was living near Frankfurt. It is possible to get work in Europe without speaking the native language, but you integrate so much better & so much faster if you do learn it, and quickly. I love Berlin, but the job market there is rubbish, and the salaries low. From what I hear, designers make more there than in Athens, though, if that is consoling. Lots of people seem to like moving to the Netherlands. I think its cities must be quite cosmopolitan, and depending on what you are looking for, pleasant.</div>
