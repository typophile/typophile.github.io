  The x height needs to be very similar. Thanks in advance.

    on?\r\n4. Who are the readers?\r\n\r\nThere's dozens of choices. Answering a few
    simple questions regarding context makes the task far easier and removes aesthetic
    guesswork. Garamond and Sabon are pretty good fallbacks. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/2021\">Nick

  body: "1. Its a Government Magazine with a different theme each publication. \r\n2.
    It is printed on a Heidelberg web press with Aqueous coating.  \r\n3. 60# Utopia
    dull No2 grade.\r\n4. Geared towards a diverse resident base covering major departments
    such as Environmental, Transportation, Public Health etc. Each has a Page and/or
    a spread dedicated to them but they all have to fit within a theme. This issue
    is all about how their tax dollars are spent. It usually has a \"Newsweek\" feel
    for content and a \"Wired\" style for layout and graphics with a size similar
    to the \"T magazine\"\r\n\r\nI don't dislike Minion I just want a modern version.
    Currently Minion is paired with Din and Titling. I have explored the use of FF
    Yoga as a good all round super family, Brioni because of its suitability for magazines
    and Premiera for its X height. Would these substitute well?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"
