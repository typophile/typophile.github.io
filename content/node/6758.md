  body: No. <BR> <BR>But then again I don&#39;t design type. <BR> <BR>I just swagger

    Maybe that depends upon how many correct font IDs you&#39;ve made lately :-&#41;

    Type Design course &#40;under Gerry Leonidas&#41; at the <a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/home.html"

  body: 'Actually, this thread is making me wonder if my degree is  <BR>worth zilch&#42;
    in the current situatioin of Art Education. It has  <BR>been completely overhauled
    in Belgium since &#34;my days&#34;  <BR>and is now called Bachelor and Master
    and so on. <BR> <BR>&#42; Mind you, I&#39;ve never really <i>needed</i> it: usually
    at job  <BR>interviews the portfolio does the trick. Has anyone of you  <BR>ever
    needed to show your diploma to get somewhere?  <BR>I reckon that in the &#40;typo&#41;graphic
    design business it only  <BR>is of secondary importance.'

    <BR>No. That is really sad &#40;especially when you pay a lot of money - Balliol/Ruskin/Yale&#41;

  body: 'I am sorry I do not have the time to get involved with this discussion here:
    partly because there are too many things I would have to say, on matters ranging
    from the rather general issue of value-added in postgraduate education in applied
    arts and humanities, to more mundane matters like planning of learning outcomes
    of MA-level programmes. But, apart from being busy preparing the torture chamber
    for the incoming group of students, I am also getting things ready for ATypI where
    we have a discrete type-education strand. So, if you make it to Prague do come
    at the panel talk, or corner me at a coffer break and I will be happy to chat.'
