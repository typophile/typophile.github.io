body: "HI, these house numbers (painted over in white) may be original to spanish
  colonial style housing community of Green Valley, AZ, which was developed in 1964.
  Many numbers still do exist on stucco exterior sides but the management does not
  track the history of this housing project. The letter B is on the door, and looks
  similiar to the 407. We have a duplex and need to improve our street numbers. I\"d
  love to match this if I can, if not, I'll do something appropriate for spanish colonial
  buildings. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Don, your picture is delightful to see, yes this is that same look and feel.
    Some hardware stores still have packages of house numbers similiar. But getting
    a number AND letter is like detective work. The Bayside is wonderful, but only
    the numbers. Thank you for responding to this post!
