  logotype.\r\nAlso does anyone know what the serif typeface on  the neck of the bottle
  is?\r\n\r\nOther than that am I correct in saying that the Sans serif is various
  weights of Helvetica, 'Pure' being Bold extended, 'Lager' light condensed etc.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJulian

  body: "You're correct about the Helvetica, and Eric is right about the Trajan. \r\n\r\nConsidering
    how basic the black lettering is, it's could be a number of fonts. It is rather
    refined and looks like a streamlined version of a traditional black letter. I
    might have been hand done for this project, or they might have cleaned up another
    font. I'd check P22, they usually have a decent amount of traditional old world
    style fonts. The S is probably hand lettered however, though it looks more like
    a flourish than a letter."
