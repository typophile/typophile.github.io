  body: In order to get a google translation of the caption, I copied/pasted some
    of the text.  I then noted that there are no spaces in the text - it seems that
    all of the letters at the ends of words a spaced with extra wide right shoulders.
    Anybody know why?

    indicisation. If so, maybe not so clever.\r\nBut I would assume that such a large
    newspaper use a proprietary layout and program which handles wordspacing differently
    than standard DTP. So, when producing a PDF, it will look OK in screen and print,
    but upon copy, wordspaces will disappear (just like linebreaks do in any PDF).\r\nTalk
    about long German words! ;-)"

  body: "C&P works for me from that PDF.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Holy Scripture \u2013
    Muslims have a different, if any, sense of humour than the Western mainstream.
    But usually they have no sense of humour \u2013 and they they don't even need
    to be Salafists for that \u2013 when it comes to the Quran. Whether this has to
    do with the so-called modernization deficits that the disenchanted and religiously
    only scantily clad West likes to attribute to the Islam? Who can tell? Anyway
    this graceful calligraphic double page from a 12th Century Seljuk Qur'an manuscript
    is at least aesthetically pleasing.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAfter translating it I'm
    still not sure what they're trying to say."

  body: "@Jens\r\nGermans \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid of Muslims. Can people who have
    done such beautiful calligraphy be evil?\r\nNot being able to read this script
    the look is just about the aesthetics of the Holy Quran, forgetting that the mediaeval
    bibles were pleasing for the eye, too. Which didn\u2019t hold the Christians back
    from slaughtering other people. It\u2019s a rather stupid argument in the current
    debate in Germany about the Salafists giving away thousands of Qurans in public.
    To me it just mirrors the suffering quality of this influental newspaper. Its
    design also was much better years before. Now they have to put a pleasing picture
    on the front page, no matter what. (For non-Germans: FAZ was one of the very few
    newspapers that had a very strong visual identity by being purely typographic
    \u2013 not a single picture on the front page. Times are changing. The Salafists
    are in the news now everywhere, so let\u2019s show a nice picture of some islamic
    calligraphy.) I\u2019m not afraid of the Salafists, nor of the Quran. Maybe some
    really interesting news were out. No news is bad news. Let\u2019s write just something
    to be up to date in a nonsense debate \u2026"
