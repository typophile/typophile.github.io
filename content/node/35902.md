  body: "I agree that this lettering looks a lot like the stuff Ale Paul and Angel
    Koziupa do (not sure who draws the letters first), but my candidate for similar
    would be Malbeck Alternate (attached)\r\n\r\nBTW, I suspect this logo is hand-lettered,
    since the two a's seem a bit different to me. Maybe one of them did the lettering.\r\n\r\n-
