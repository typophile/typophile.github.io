body: Hi all - I am working on an identity project for a client in Russia. I need
  to find a cyrillic font which reflects a contemporary interpretation of a heritage
  brand. I am thinking something along the lines of Fedra Serif, but I need a cyrillic
  character set. Any suggestions?

    Scotch Modern was the prevalent serif style immediately prior to the Russian revolution.\r\nDuring
    the Soviet era, it was revived as New Standard, which, like revivals of the Scotch
    Modern elsewhere, was \"cleaned up\", so this finely-detailed digitization of
    the letterpress effect represents a fresh take on the genre."
