body: "Hi, I've read the guidelines, but I apologize in advance if I'm doing some
  incorrectly. I'm trying to figure out the font used on [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/SheMayLookCleanBut.jpg|this
  poster]]. Near as I can tell, it's the same font for all the text, save for \"VDgraphic
  - 9\" in the bottom left corner, which isn't important.\r\n\r\nI've tried to identify
  this font myself, and I've tried using WhatTheFont! and Identifont, but, to no avail.
  The guide here also linked me to Type Navigator at typenav.fontshop.com, but that
  appears to be down.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this poster is from the early 1940s, no later
  than 1945, made by the government as a VD propaganda poster. It's been posted [[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/visualculture/infectious21.html|here]],
  which has a small amount of information about it. This is probably an easy one for
  many of you, but, I can't figure it out, and I'd greatly appreciate any help anyone
  can provide. Thanks. :D"

    any differences- and those, as in the 'A' might simply be a difference of weight.
    Thanks, Ryuk! (Death Note reference?)\r\n\r\nI would be interested in further
    input if anyone finds a better match and/or the actual font, provided this isn't
    it."

  body: If the poster is original, it's almost certainly hand-painted (letters included).
    So you will not find "the" font.

  body: Besides there being other propaganda posters from the same era with this same
    font, the letters used there are the exact same as other instances of the same
    letter- even when the size is different. Unless hand-painted has some special
    font-related meaning I'm not aware of, there seems to be a typeface that is being
    used here- or they had a savant "paint" this.

  body: '@ Joseph: Riccardo seems to be using the widely-accepted definition of a
    <em>font</em> as a set of letterforms used to replicate letters by a mechanical,
    optical, or digital device. If an artist makes the letters without any such device,
    then no <em>font</em> is used (although the artist may use a <em>font</em> as
    the model for the letters he/she draws by hand, as the artist for this poster
    may have done with Titling Gothic Skyline Medium). '

  body: "I appreciate the information. I don't know much about hand-painting text,
    but, considering the perfection between same letters on this poster, and considering
    some of the other posters [[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/visualculture/venereal.html#21|here]]
    (reachable from the page I linked in my original post), I'm disinclined to believe
    the letters themselves were painted.\r\n\r\nTitling Gothic Skyline Medium is incredibly
    close, the only differences I was able to notice were things like the gap in the
    A, which seem as though they could be explaining by bolding. Ryuk's post introducing
    it mentioned them as similars, though, and I'm sure he has a more educated opinion
    than I about why they could not be the same. I remain of the opinion from looking
    at the posters, however, that there does exist some sort of typeface that was
    used for this- though I'm not sure how it'd be evident what media they may have
    used to utilize said typeface."
