body: "Does anyone have intelligence (or heard rumors) about which fonts will be bundled
  with Adobe CS5?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I've been auditing installed fonts at computer
  labs in a couple of institutions (as well as on my own Macs), and was hoping to
  get a handy list of which fonts shipped with which versions of Adobe CS. I remembered
  there had been conversations here about this, so I poked around and figured it might
  be useful to re-post Thomas Phinney's lists from his Typblography (thanks again,
  Thomas):\r\n\r\nFonts that shipped with CS3\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/04/cs3_bundled_fon.html\r\n\r\nFonts
  that shipped with CS4\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4_fonts.html\r\n\r\nI'm
  left with some questions -- like, did Warnock Pro or Brioso Pro fonts ever ship
  bundled with other Adobe products? How'd they get on these lab computers!? Cussed
  pirates!\r\n\r\n- Matthew"

  body: Brioso fonts were offered as a registration incentive for CS1. I'm sure Warnock
    Pro fonts were also bundled with the first CS release.

  body: "Is this Nicole Mendoza correct? She starts right off the bat with this statement\r\n\r\n\"The
    font set shipping with CS5 closely resembles the CS4 set with the following exceptions:\r\nThe
    following families have been added to the CS5 font set: \r\n\r\nAdobe Arabic (4
    fonts)\r\nAdobe Hebrew (4 fonts)\"\r\n\r\nCurious as ever, I went to the exact
    list, to see these at the very top:\r\n\r\nAdobeArabic, in all 4 styles\r\nAdobeHebrew,
    in all 4 styles\r\n\r\nbut these were already in the <em>CS4</em> package. I'll
    grant her, they were <em>not</em> installed by default, but I would still not
    list them as \"added\"."
