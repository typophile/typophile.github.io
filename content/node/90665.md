body: "When looking through books published from early movable type, I am often struck
  by how different the italics appear to modern works published with, purportedly,
  the same faces, digitalised.\r\n\r\nThe modern Italics often seem far less flamboyant
  than their historic predecessors but I cannot work out whether this is due to the
  digitalisations being toned down in their reproduction of the forms; changes in
  typesetting practices or just my imagination.\r\n\r\nFor example, looking at some
  examples of [[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uspkC7Qycjw/TywEKc0ht0I/AAAAAAAABCs/LvRDbuZRwzU/s1600/Updike%2Bfig%2B172.JPG|Jannon
  Italic]] or the example in Carter\u2019s \u201CA View of Early Typography\u201D
  at fig. 83, the Italics seem more striking than they do in modern revivals.\r\n\r\nOf
  course, much of the flamboyance seems to be caused by greater use of swash letters
  (obvious in the Qs but also in the initial u); ligatures (in addition to the traditional
  \u201Cold-style\u201D ligatures, ligatures such as the us and is which are rarely
  found in modern fonts); and less kerning than is possible today. However, I often
  feel that historic Italics sit less comfortably on the base-line than their modern
  revivals (for example look at the start of the word accoustum\xE9 in the second
  Italic line of the linked file); and that they tend to have less even stroke variation,
  in that the amount of contrast between the strokes is often different in different
  letters. I think, combined with the greater number of glyphs (e.g. a stand-alone
  s is rarely the same as the s in the st ligature, as it would be now), this makes
  the faces seem more extravagant, but I am worried that this may just be my imagination.\r\n\r\nAlthough,
  I\u2019ve been wondering about this for a while but do not have sufficient numbers
  of examples to be able to make proper conclusions. I was therefore wondering what
  typophile members thought about this.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJacob"

  body: "This type is alive, for several reasons! It's wonky, shoddy, un-even, bits
    have broken off. The regular doesn't sit straight on its baseline either. The
    italics lean forward and backward, some individual characters almost look roman.
    Stem widths are un-even.\r\n\r\nI love it. No surprise here that digital versions
    look flat and dead in comparison."

    your attention to convey the text, and to me\r\nthe best Italic is a subservient
    one. So I think the older\r\nphilosophy reflects a less sophisticated understanding\r\nof
    how an Italic is supposed to be read.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think a subordinate Italic
    needs to look dead:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garams_4479.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere, I reset
    the deck from a 1920s magazine article in the 1990s, to compare foundry type with
    digital type.\r\nI had long been interested in the sterilizing effect that technological
    progress, with its greater precision, has upon older forms.\r\nFor indeed, this
    is not a new digital phenomenon.\r\nFred Goudy addressed the issue with many of
    his designs, made for metal, such as Garamont and Kennerley. \r\nDo italics suffer
    more than the roman?\r\n\r\nWhatever reasons Robert Slimbach had for \u201Ccleaning
    up\u201D Adobe Garamond, there is also a certain amount of technological determinism
    at play: in particular the role of hinting and alignment zones in PostScript Type
    1, which tend to regularize x-heights. If you don\u2019t standardize x-heights,
    slight deviations become ridiculously and unpredictably exaggerated at low resolutions\u2014so
    rather than the charming and evenly distributed wonkyness of old letterpress,
    what you get is abrupt oddities standing out from conformity. \r\n\r\nThe italics
    of Garamond Premier Pro have slightly more personality than the older Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nAt
    any rate, there are by now, twenty-five years into digital type on personal computers,
    and with a solid ten years of prolific \u201Cindie\u201D foundry font publishing,
    plenty of sturdy text faces with interesting new italics. Quadraat and Dolly spring
    to mind, both over 10 years old now. For my part, rather than redo Garamond, I
    produced a new design in the garalde genre\u2014Oneleigh, with italics inspired
    by Oz Cooper\u2019s love of a certain off-kilter font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
