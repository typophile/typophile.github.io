body: "I've had a hard time IDing this for a friend. It's from People Magazine. It
  looks like Neuraface Condensed or Relay but its not. I realize it could be custom
  but I'm hoping for a simpler explanation. By the way, note the Georgia italic with
  the custom \"y.\" Any help appreciated as always.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The sans is very similar to Gotham Condensed, could be a slightly customized
    version maybe?

  body: "\"Cairo\", a True Type font will work.  I created a very realistic mockup
    of a magazine cover by manipulating the individual letters in Photoshop (crunched
    the letters together, rasterized, created a stroke around each letter).  This
    image is of the font without any manipulation.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cairo-font_3749.jpg]"
