  body: "I agree with Hrant, interesting site, thanks.\r\n\r\nTypography:\r\nI can't
    claim that it kickstarted my ambition but a bit later in my education I found
    <em>Raster systeme</em> by JMB. I think it gave me a desire to know my own work
    inside-out and that maybe designing type would allow me an even more intimate
    understanding of layout and typesetting, from micro to macro.\r\n\r\nType design:\r\n<em>Adrian
    Frutiger Typefaces.</em>  This has been inspiring me for the past year.\r\n\r\nThese
    are quite Titanic books and easy to suggest. What about the many smaller books
    along the way:\r\n\r\nAs a kid I loved Dorling Kindersley educational books, which
    were fantastically arranged and really easy to navigate. They were also really
    consistent in series. At high school I studied Russian language and the textbooks
    were influential, as was learning a new alphabet. <em>\u0418\u0441\u043A\u0440\u0430</em>,
    which was practically a zine as it was composed on a typewriter and <em>\u0412\u043F\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0434!</em>,
    which had fantastic 3d lettering as well as photography of signage, stamps and
    general ephemera. I was also inspired at some point by <em>Schott's Miscellany</em>
    which is typeset and designed by the author."

    little note in the back of \"In His Majesty's Service\" by Naomi Novik. It said
    the book was set in Granjon typeface, and that's inspired me to look further into
    typography and typefaces. To learn more about typography, I'm purchasing:\r\n\r\nThe
    Stroke: Theory of Writing\r\nby Gerrit Noordzij\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nThe Elements
    of Typographic Style\r\nby Robert Bringhurst"

    situation: be careful of \"growing up\" thinking that type is based on chirography
    (what the hand holding a particular writing instrument tends to produce) since
    it might trap you on one continent of exploration. Gerrit Noordzij is the intelligent,
    charismatic high priest of chirographic type. Mind the foundations you lay for
    yourself.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Two things come immediately to mind:\r\n\r\nThe biography of Bram de Does,
    edited by Mathieu Lommen. I read it shortly after it was published, at a time
    when the business of making fonts for a living \u2014 meeting deadlines, responding
    to bug logs, trying to solve knotty technical problems \u2014 was beginning to
    take the pleasure out of designing type. This book was inspiring as a record of
    a humane and intelligent life in type design and typography, and a timely reminder
    of the things that first attracted me to this work. Hmm, maybe it's time to re-read
    it.\r\n\r\nGerrit Noordzij's <em>Letterletter</em> (and later <em>The Stroke</em>).
    What I found inspiring in Noordzij was the development of systematic ideas about
    letters which enabled techniques of analysis and understanding. No one else I
    have read has attempted this, so while I'll go some way to seconding Hrant's caveats
    about how one approaches Noordzij \u2014 including how Hrant approaches Noordzij
    \u2014, I consider these books inspiring in encouraging an analytical approach.
    So far, there is nothing similar in terms of scope and depth attempted from a
    different perspective, but there should be."
