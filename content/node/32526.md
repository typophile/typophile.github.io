  cars. I have attached a pict as an example.\r\n\r\nFYI-\r\nThis was asked in late
  2004 at the following url (http://typophile.com/node/4442) however no one replied.
  Perhaps someone has learned or signed up since then.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRastus\r\n"

  body: Badges and emblems are often not made with fonts but designed by the auto
    makers specifically for the cars. I believe that is the case here. Your examples
    are something like a strange amalgam of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Eurostile">Eurostile</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Trademarker">FF
    Trademarker</a>, and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Serpentine">Serpentine</a>.
