body: 'A friend sent me a small word processor/dictionary program that he has written
  in Java.  When I use one of my fonts with this program, the line spacing is noticeably
  too small.  This comes right after I had redone the vertical metrics so that Mac
  and Windows display would match . . . <BR> <BR>My friend says that he used only
  standard Java font handling routines, whatever those may be.  I&#39;m not a programmer
  so I have no clue what is going on.  Only this one font is affected. <BR> <BR>I
  can think of only one explanation: the font in question has many extra-tall characters.  I
  therefore set the Line Gap values at zero and put more space in the Ascender/WinAscent
  values.  Could the lack of any LineGap spacing be the problem?  Any Java gurus here?
  <BR> <BR>The font in question works fine in all regular Windows and Mac apps. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks for any help - David'

    <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Java font handling is following the
    spec rather than matching the buggy behavior of many Windows apps. <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Thanks, Thomas.  It was another, more detailed post by John Hudson that I
    used to get the Mac and Windows linespacing to be consistent.  The WinAscent,
    TypoAscender, and hhea Ascender values &#40;all the same, BTW&#41; provide plenty
    of clearance.  Whichever system is used to calculate line spacing -- the &#34;typo&#34;
    values as in Microsoft&#39;s spec, the hhea values as in Apple&#39;s spec, or
    the unofficial but widely used WinAscent -- should not produce squished line spacing
    in this font.  I set these values very carefully--so that&#39;s why I&#39;m puzzled.

    my brain is made of mashed potatos. I need to take a nap. <BR> <BR>T
