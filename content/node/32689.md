  body: It would be nice if there were more contemporary versions of "oldstyle" fonts.
    Something that retains the charm these typefaces have without shoving the idea
    of "Colonials, Pirates, and Cowboys" down my throat.

  body: i agree, but these are obviously novelty faces. if it's called deadmanschest.ttf,
    it's going to be kinda goofy.

  body: I guess I'm just upset there aren't more fonts that blend Utilitarian and
    Style together better. It's either one or the other and it effects how far that
    font is developed. Outside of a Script there aren't many super fonts that satisfy
    both needs well.

  body: i know. especially seeing some of the beautiful and quirky forms that came
    out of the tiny houses long ago. i suppose though, that by their very nature,
    those faces are so evocative of a particular genre or period that they wouldn't
    function well in common use these days. so we're left with "paulrevereshorse.ttf"
    and stuff like that.

  body: "What are you using this for?\r\n\r\nCheck out Fonts&Logos by Doyald Young
    (speaking of Art Center) pp.110-113 where he nails this style for LORETO. Not
    a font however :-)\r\n\r\nIt looks like spanish/italian painted lettering -- what
    was my first clue :-) The ogee shape shows up in rococo and arts-n-crafts in northern
    europe also. I can see the small caps of DTL Fleischman with ogee crossbars evoking
    the same rustic look.\r\n\r\nIf this is for a logo, then letter it, or hire someone
    to do the lettering. It will get you much closer to what you want. Sorry, not
    a convenient answer.\r\n\r\nR"

    genre or period that they wouldn\u2019t function well in common use these days.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    just it. Why do they have to look exactly like the original, why can't it just
    borrow some of the charm and character. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture
    1_66_4249.png]\r\n\r\nThe example has an old world charm, but the letters are
    really pretty normal aside from the embellishments. Just look at \"Hotel\", the
    majority of the characters are slab serifed, but what makes it unique are the
    embellishments of the crossbar on the H and E, and of course the inconsistent
    outline. Same with the A's in San Agustin. This has a modern feel, and I could
    see it being used often, but what sets it apart from a standard utilitarian font
    is the additional features (which could be Alternative figure set in a font).

  body: "Thanks everyone. I think I'll end up modifiying an existing font.\r\n(I don't
    want anything too piratey.)\r\n\r\nFYI, the photo comes from some Mexican colonial
    signage. \r\nThe web site I found it on says this:\r\n\"In order to keep a colonial
    flavour to the cities settled by the Spanish conquerors in the center of Mexico
    (Morelia, Patzcuaro & Puebla), most of the signs of this area respect the following
    rules: composition in an incised typeface, first letter composed in red and substitution
    of the capital \u2018O\u2019 by a lower-case \u2018o\u2019 above a tilde. \""
