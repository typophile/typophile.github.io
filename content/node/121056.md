  - it's just that i need an expert eye\u2026\r\n\u2026but see for yourself:\r\n\r\ni
  would say the top headline is a bookman font; the one closest is bookmania semi.\r\ni
  cannot however find the fitting swashy letters.\r\nbottom line looks more like a
  condensed bookman, also with swashes - pls note the steep capital_r; the stroke
  of the top swashes is going a bit upwards (just as in above line)\r\n\r\ncover made
  in gb '65\r\n\r\n(resource probably a scan with minimal distortion)\r\n\r\ngood

  body: "Confirming Bookman. Quoting MF description text: \"Bookmania (2011) is a
    revival of Bookman Oldstyle (1901) and the Bookmans of the 1960s, but with all
    the features you would expect in a modern digital font family.\" Don't know any
    other version of Bookman available with such an amount of alternate glyphs: /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/547|B]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/1653|k]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/1789|r]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/1965|y]]
    and /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/279|A]]
    for your sample\r\nBaseline is also Bookman. My suggestion would probably to keep
    Bookmania scaling it to match the lettering using /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/775|K]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/917|N]],

    and /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/519883/1050|R]]
    alternate glyphs."

    could perhaps try to contact Mark Simonson, who could have stumbled on this specific
    cut during his research on Bookmania.\r\nAs for the joke, I don't understand what
    you're talking about, Vach's Mass in V minor is a classic."

    As we said, this is Bookman but from the pre-digital era thus the differences."
