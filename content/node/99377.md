  body: "Good to hear, Erum.\r\n\r\nHrant - You seem to increasingly be trying to
    dictate the rules of this forum.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you just might be missing
    the very legitimate, \"I can't afford it\" factor. Erum didn't ask for a freebie
    ripoff of Genial. He asked for a free <em>alternative</em> (and was, it seems,
    happy to pay for a cheaper option [than $77 for the whole family] on the original).\r\n\r\nI
    hate ripoff clones of commercial fonts as much as you, but sometimes very cheap
    or free alternatives are the only option for posters. What is suggested to them
    as a poor substitute may be a crappy font, but their crappy font budget may be
    able to afford nothing better and, so, your 'hranting\" against affording them
    options is truly misguided.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I don't think that your stance of,
    \"Please do not ask for or suggest free alternatives\" is an official Typophile
    policy but, rather, a personal agenda.\r\n\r\nLastly, your dislike of revivals
    because it's hard to determine legitimacy is not the poster's problem - it's yours.
    Those of us who recognize a typeface as originally an old metal or wood creation
    understand that anyone is free to create a digital version -no matter the quality.
    Again, your inability to do so should <em>not</em> be the poster's problem."

    agenda.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBingo.\r\nPlease look up what \"dictate\" means. And
    look up \"please\" while you're at it. Please.\r\n\r\nI've been a Typophile member
    since week 2, and remain one of its most dedicated users. But I've never had any
    formal authority (probably mostly because I've never wanted it) and have very
    rarely asked the moderators for anything (and never BTW for the removal of a member).
    Maybe my tone threw you off; on the Internet (and these days apparently most of
    the US as well) it seems only official moderators are supposed to (in fact <em>have</em>
    to) express themselves in measured terms - everybody else is expected to engage
    in trench warfare...\r\n\r\nMy agenda is no secret, and is nothing nefarious -
    quite the contrary: I want to support typeface design, and I want Typophile to
    be healthy. Nasty stuff, eh? To me what's nasty is the increase in catering to
    users who hurt the craft, helping them ID fonts only to steal them, helping them
    find free clones, etc.\r\n\r\nCan't afford it? I do feel I'm sensitive to that*
    but there are limits, especially when it comes to choosing \"just the right font\",
    which is essentially a luxury, not a need. That said, I certainly agree that settling
    for buying a bad font is much better than pirating a good one. You should note
    that I wrote my post above at a point where it seemed probable that Erum simply
    didn't want pay <em>anything</em>. I'm glad that doesn't seem to be the case -
    thank you, Erum.\r\n\r\n* As I've said elsewhere I feel even outright <em>property
    theft</em> can sometimes be justified.\r\n\r\nBTW this recent thread is pretty
    revealing all-around I think:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99112\r\n\r\n<blockquote>your
    dislike of revivals</blockquote>\r\n\r\nPlease bring that up in the pertinent
    thread and I will gladly address it - I don't want to distract from the helpful
    conversation happening here.\r\n\r\nAs for what's whose problem: this is a community
    - your problems are my problems (just milder). People who don't like community
    responsibilities can go live in the forest.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
