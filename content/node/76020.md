  designer and really want help to find out what these are (i've tried \"What Font
  is That\" and \"Identifont\" already).\r\n\r\nThere are a few fonts, as far as I
  can count: the serif one used for people's name, a curved-joined san serif font
  (\"Nicholas Hoult\" name), and a simple San Serif for some of the text (it's not
  Futura, it's more narrow, and has an angle (the e goes up, the W's middle bar pushes
  to the left - I think it's like \"Organic\" or something).\r\n\r\nPlease please,
  would also love to know if you know what the Drama title font is.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nP.S.
  Enjoy the photography\r\n\r\nP.S.S. I just put samples of the fonts here, if that's
  easier. Thank you"

    and the serif a combination of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon/regular/|Caslon
