I used to leave them blank because I didn&rsquo;t realize how critical they were for typographers in preventing expensive disasters. For example: going to press without spotting missing glyphs. Recently MyFonts (the <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/whatsnew/">new site</a>) added a choice of multilingual pangrams. So give it a try. Switch your sample text to Japanese and browse. If my .notdefs are missing it&rsquo;s because I forgot to add them. But some font designers seem to always leave them out and most do it about half the time.</p>
<p>My point: does anyone deliberately leave .notdefs blank? If so, why?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, it&rsquo;s not a good idea to leave the .notdef glyph blank. The point of the glyph is to signal the presence of characters not supported by the font, and that includes characters beyond the codepages that the font aims to support. If your .notdef glyph is blank or, worse, blank and zero-width, those characters will simply disappear from the text in many applications. Consider what happens if someone is using one of your fine fonts, but is sent a text for typesetting that includes e.g. one Chinese character. There should be some visible indication that this character is present and that it requires a different font to be selected.</p>
<p>My preferred .notdef design is a box with a question mark in it. Recently, seeking to give this maximum visual impact on the page, I&rsquo;ve taken to reversing the question mark out of a black box. I usually align the height of the box to the cap-height, because this producing a proportion that doesn&rsquo;t have an atypical impact on the line-layout, i.e. its width is representative of a typical missing character.</p>

<p>I do recall a customer complaint. One chap had been using a random Arial codepoint that resulted in a missing glyph. He used it as a check-box on all his forms. When we updated the font his check boxes were all replaced with the obscure character that belonged in that slot.</p>
<p>Also there are “blank” code-points in Unicode – all those different spaces for example – if you don’t populate them and have a blank missing glyph, expected spacing could be messed up.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, the .notdef glyph dates back to Apple&rsquo;s original TT spec: it is to be the first glyph in a font, it is to be named .notdef, and it is to be unencoded. It provides the ultimate fallback &ndash; after font switching or other mechanisms that an application may choose to employ &ndash; to display <em>something</em> when text includes a character that is not supported in the font. The .notdef glyph is not a Unicode characters because it may represent <em>any</em> Unicode character that is not mapped in the font cmap table.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad we don&rsquo;t. I recall some users being confused by the spiral in the Palatino Linotype fonts. It is better that this glyph approximate the evolved conventions: an empty rectangle, a rectangle with diagonal lines corner-to-corner (the form Adobe uses), a rectangle with a question mark in it, a reversed rectangle with a question mark in it.</p>
<p>In traditional Japanese typography, a placeholder sort was used for a similar purpose: to mark a place in the text that would require a character from a different font. This enabled the typesetter to keep working and to leave a visible marker in the text to indicate the place where the other-font character should be inserted. If I recall correctly, the sort had a horizontal rectangle in the upper half, so would print as a black rectangle above a white rectangular space. This form might be appropriate for the .notdef glyph in an East Asian font, although Ken Lunde should comment on this and correct me if I am wrong. It led me to experiment with this form:</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case, as there is a variety of glyphs used to represent absent characters, as well as emptiness.
Perhaps it would be better to handle this at a deeper level than fonts?</p>
<p>Alternatively, Unicode could specify a preferred glyph shape for &ldquo;.notdef&rdquo;, even if it has no code number.
That would at least apply some standard to the situation, and provide direction to font developers, internationally.</p>

<p>For instance, let&rsquo;s say a piece of text includes a character not supported by the current font cmap table. An application (or system/library/engine) may automatically use the .notdef glyph, or it may go through a series of degrading fallbacks. It may try to find a default font on the system for displaying the character; if it can&rsquo;t find such a font, it may try to find a default fallback font such as Apple use in order to at least identify the Unicode range and script to which the missing character belongs; if the system does not have such a font, the ultimate fallback should still be the .notdef glyph.</p>
<p><em>Alternatively, Unicode could specify a preferred glyph shape for “.notdef”, even if it has no code number.</em></p>
<p>This has nothing to do with Unicode. The .notdef glyph is not a Unicode character; its function is defined by the Apple TT spec.</p>

<p>Thanks, Ken. I remember now the three-band placeholder. I did try a .notdef glyph based on this with a superimposed question mark, but it was too messy at small sizes.</p>

<p>How are we going to get all the foundries to play ball, especially when there is no Unicode guide to suggest a standard glyph shape?
Having the standard in the Microsoft TT spec is not comprehensive enough.</p>
<p><em>This has nothing to do with Unicode. </em></p>
<p>By the same token, it&rsquo;s not really a responsibility of font formats
As Unicode is all about character encoding, it may be better positioned to deal with the lack of an encoded character than font formats.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OpenType (and TrueType) fonts are designed to be fairly self-contained. Depending on external resources, such as the rendering of the &ldquo;.notdef&rdquo; glyph goes against this, though some clients may choose to implement their own handling of &ldquo;.notdef&rdquo; situations. This is also the reason why the mapping from character codes to glyphs are included in the fonts themselves, in the form of the &lsquo;cmap&rsquo; table.</p>

<p>Nick, it&rsquo;s also in the Adobe CFF specification, so pretty much any font that doesn&rsquo;t have it is buggy.</p>
<p>But I think your point is that it&rsquo;s not required to be a particular mark, or any mark at all. (Maybe there is some suggestion somewhere in Adobe&rsquo;s documentation, I&rsquo;m not sure.) It would maybe be nice if FontLab and other significant tools had a reasonable default notdef shape built-in.</p>

<p>Nick, We key about 2 manuscripts a year. Well, no, we no longer key, we send out about 2 manuscripts a year to be keyed . . . The other 398 arrive &ldquo;editorially correct on disk.&rdquo; We set them with one of the few apps that supports OT - Adobe&rsquo;s InDesign. Not one of our customers would accept, say, an Ariel character if the MS called for a glyph not in the font. And not one of the graphic designers will check to see if the typeface they have selected in fact has all the characters called in the MS, (which may, BTW, have substituted characters from another font).</p>
<p>Yes, we do have a little script we run that shows all the Unicode characters called in the MS. But you can miss something; each proofing pass catches about 98 percent of the errors.</p>
<p>So, (1) The appearance of the missing glyphs is important. The starker, the better. And (2) it is important the end user has the right to add the missing glyph &ndash; like the ygrave I encountered today.</p>
<p>I understand ID-CS4 won&rsquo;t let you export to PDF unless all the needed characters are present. But sadly, I flat guarantee you ID-CS2 will.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kevin: <em>Isn’t .notdef Unicode #FFFD? If not, shouldn’t it be?</em></p>
<p>U+FFFD is used to replace an incoming character whose value is unknown or unrepresentable in Unicode, e.g. where you have text in a different encoding for which software can&rsquo;t figure a way to convert to Unicode. So U+FFFD indicates a character not recognised as Unicode, whereas the .notdef <em>glyph</em> indicates a character not supported by the font. U+FFFD appears in text up-stream of display; .notdef appears in text during glyph display.</p>

<p>Well, it is pink. I&rsquo;ve seen fonts where the size &ndash; width &ndash; is quite small. I&rsquo;d assumed the &ldquo;pink&rdquo; is the width assigned to the .notdef character; I suppose I should check. I&rsquo;ve missed a few.</p>
<p>Pink doesn&rsquo;t work when your primary checking/proofing method is to print out the job and have it read (or skimmed) by someone other then the comp who set it. An old idea, but still a good one. BTW, with &ldquo;editorially correct&rdquo; files supplied, we don&rsquo;t read against copy.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">@Jan (paragraph): Both. In InDesign, missing fonts and missing characters are both marked with a pink highlight that can be toggled in the preferences (Compositon &gt; Substituted Fonts). If the font has a .notdef glyph, missing characters are substituted with that glyph <strong>and</strong> get highlighted. Otherwise it’s just a highlighted blank space. I reckon the width of that blank space is one <strong>en</strong> space.

<p>For entire missing fonts, it seems ID checks for a <em>reasonable</em> match &ndash; the same Unicode in its default font (Myriad?), or in a font matching the name but not the style. A missing glyph in an otherwise good font usually displays the notdef glyph.</p>
<p>Pre-CS4 InDesign, it used to be a matter of carefully examining the document (in InDesign), but hip-hip-hooray! CS4 <em>finally</em> marks &lsquo;missing glyphs&rsquo; as an error in its live preflight.</p>
