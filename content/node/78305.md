  to share a project that I've been working on with everyone. About six or seven months
  ago I started helping out with DesignChat.\r\n\r\nDesignChat is a live video chat
  that airs every Wednesday night at 8pm CST. We broadcast from smbolic (formerly
  SamataMason) and interview some of the coolest people in the industry for about
  an hour each week. So far we've had some amazing guests like Milton Glaser, Erik
  Spiekermann, Debbie Millman, Jessica Hische and many others.\r\n\r\nIf you have
  a chance, check out the live show on Wednesday nights. We use a platform called
  Vokle to broadcast the shows and it allows the audience to chat, submit text questions
  and even get on screen via webcam to ask a live video question. It's extremely interactive
  and a great opportunity to get face to face with some design legends. If you're
  unable to check us out live, we release the episodes as a podcast on iTunes afterwards.\r\n\r\nI
  highly recommend everyone check out the show at www.designchat.info and also subscribe
  to the podcast on iTunes. I'd love to hear feedback also on the site, videos or
  even guest recommendations."
