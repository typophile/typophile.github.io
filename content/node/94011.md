body: "I am shopping for a used hot foil stamping machine.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm wondering
  about: how cross-manufacturer compatible is the type used by these machines? For
  example, if I buy a Howard machine, can it use type from old Kingsley machines?
  If so, can the type be mixed or is it only compatible if used separately, due to
  height differences?\r\n\r\nPardon the cross-posting with ATypI list. I am guessing
  that even in these crowds, this is pretty obscure!"

    of manufacturers who advertise such as  "Our Kwikprint fonts are universally compatible
    with most foil stamping machines"

    it like the plague. Otherwise, a practical, serviceable hot-stamping machine will
    use the same type as any other machine in a letterpress shop\u2014off-the-shelf
    foundry type."

    about hot foil stamping machines, but the one we had in the bookbinding workshop
    at university used brass type. I assumed there was a reason for that, like different
    heat conductivity compared to lead type."

  body: Yes, my limited experience with these machines suggests they all need brass
    type, not lead (foundry) type.

  body: "Type specifically made for hot foil stamping machines is generally brass
    or zinc. Although the standard temperatures used are not enough to actually melt
    metal type, they do soften it a little and cause it to wear faster. I don't know
    how much faster. For light usage and one-off printing I expect to mostly do, I
    am in principle willing to try foundry type as well. But I'd rather use the \"right
    stuff\" where possible.\r\n\r\nFor the composition of foundry type, even cold
    metal type has always been an alloy, and always mostly lead. According to Carter\u2019s
    <em>A View of Early Typography</em>, Plantin in 1580 used \u201C82 per cent lead,
    9 per cent tin, and 6 per cent antimony, with a little copper. The modern standard
    for a hard typefounder\u2019s alloy is about 15 per cent tin, 25 per cent antimony,
    and 60 per cent lead with a trace of copper.\u201D However, smaller foundry metal
    type often had a higher tin content to give it the fluidity necessary to get into
    small cavities."

  body: BTW, I ended up buying a Kingsley M-101 machine. It should arrive on Saturday.
    Since most of the hot stamping type out there is Kingsley stuff, that resolves
    any compatibility worry.

  body: Foundry type has always been mostly lead. It may simply have slightly more
    tin or antimony (or, rarely, a bit of copper) than hot metal type.

  body: I have been doing some hot foil stamping on book covers and spines (bookcloth)
    and I would appreciate any comments or information on using foundry type in a
    hot foil stamping machine.  While the foundry type is softer than that used in
    hot foil type I think that it would work for small runs, maybe 2 or 3 covers.  I
    base this on the fact that foundry type, which I understand is lead, has a melting
    point above 600 degrees while hot stamping requires 300 degrees or less.

    lower it''s melting temperature. Odd situation: the alloys that give more strength
    lower the melting point. '

  body: Thank you.  I never considered that.  I am starting to think that it may not
    be feasible to use the foundry type.  If someone as used foundry type for hot
    foil stamping please let me know what your experience was .  Alternately, I will
    try to get a few pieces of foundry type and try it.  When I do I will post the
    results.
