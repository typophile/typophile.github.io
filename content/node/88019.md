  on the screen and some only on the paper?\r\n\r\nAre they re-designed for the screen?\r\n\r\nConcretely
  I compared [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-blur|Blur]] font printed and
  on screen.\r\n\r\nThe one on paper looked very good while on the screen looked good
  only at higher sizes."
