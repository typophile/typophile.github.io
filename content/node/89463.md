  body: I think that the number of designers who would even want to, and are actually
    capable of doing so, is so low that any answer could not represent enough of a
    sample to be seriously considered when pricing fonts.

  body: "Like I said on Twitter, I think it's an interesting idea. You'd have sort
    of a consumer / extended license split. I'd ideally like the modification-friendliness
    to be an add-on that can be bought after purchase as well (since when one licenses
    a font one wouldn't necessarily already know if mods might be needed). This might
    make \xABnormal\xBB customers feel good for not paying for rights they don't need,
    and make \xABextended\xBB clients happy too because paying an additional fee and
    modding oneself (provided one is capable of doing so) might seem more interesting
    than commissioning changes directly from the foundry (so the latter would of course
    lose some of the revenue from commissioned modifications, which would likely be
    much more expensive...)."

    where you have a list of options that\r\nadd to the price, like a moonroof or
    heated seats. And\r\nfor the easily-overwhelmed shopper we could have\r\npreset
    packages like cars have \"Sport\", etc.\r\n\r\nSo what's the list of options a
    font could come with?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    allowed\" list and raise the price, than add a lot of options. Options are nice,
    yes, but why not just make something great and stick to your guns?"

  body: "As a user of type, I would pay a modest sum for the right to modify. If the
    modification was to add more characters, improve the letterfit, etc, I would charge
    the extra modification fee back to my customers. I would of course first recommend
    to my customers that they not use such a font, but people get caught up in fashion.\r\n\r\nTo
    be clear: I wouldn't (usually) charge my customers for the needed work, only for
    having to pay the publisher more for the right to fix their font. If you find
    that too brutal, sorry. It would be different if the modifications anticipated
    were for, say, one-off logo use. But if the work is to fix the spacing, add extra
    characters, etc., it seems odd to have to pay for the right.\r\n\r\nAn interesting
    option would be that the right to do this kind of work was free, but the additions
    would have to be made available to the font publisher at no charge, so they could,
    if they chose, include them in future releases. That would make the end user think
    hard about the whole issue. I view my modified fonts as giving us a competitive
    advantage over other typesetters. To then give the font publisher the right to
    add my work to their fonts would (in my mind) lessen that advantage. It would
    make us end-users think about the issue with the shoe on the other foot."

  body: 'Having been on the other side of the table (as a type user), I know the frustration
    of having the skills but not the permission to fix issues. Modifications for personal
    use should, IMO, be a given. Apart from the financial side, what is the arguments
    against allowing designers to modify on behalf of their clients as well?  '

  body: "It is an interesting question, Frode. I think the difference between the
    European and U.S. copyright laws points up the obvious on the question of allowing
    designers to modify fonts on behalf of their clients as well. In the States, you
    can copyright software, but not designs. So to be legal, you copy the font into
    the background layer of FontLab, then delete all the points on the front layer
    -- all you have is a gray mass that sort of represents the character(s). Then
    you autotrace. The result is legal, but also terrible. You will spend considerable
    time fixing the autotrace to get anything useful. Then make your modifications
    for the client. Being able to modify the font itself should cost less than your
    time is worth to do the the work of recreating the font. That way, everybody wins.\r\n\r\nIn
    Europe, I believe the copyright laws are different. But all that really means
    is you have to add a person who can draw, while looking at the characters. Then,
    all the etc. BTW, I believe some parts of the European copyright law are more
    reasonable than in the States -- It is a confusing situation.\r\n\r\nAside from
    the law, the point remains: if starting with the original font saves you time,
    then the font publisher is due some compensation for that savings.\r\n"
