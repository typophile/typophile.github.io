  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear Sir or Madam,

I recently joined a polo club, and we have decided to create business cards which we can handout during events. Since appearance plays a large role at such events I really want to put some effort into creating great looking business cards. Currently I am considering using some decadent colored paper. I have also looked into using [[http://www.drukkerijdouma.nl/diensten/foliedruk/|gold]] or [[http://www.packvision.nl/NL/Folies/Parelmoer_Folies/|pearl]] lettering. To top it off i might want to use [[http://creativebits.org/files/126895462_d86b4b5425.jpg|gold edging]], not sure about that though.

Since this seems to be the place where typophiles hang around I am open for suggestions on fonts. Can anyone recommend some free fonts which would create a classier look? I browsed the forums and saw some very nice fonts, such as the Diamond font from http://www.orangeitalic.com/ but 299$ is too exotic for me!

Here is what I created so far:
(still has the bleed margins or something)

		<div class="commentbody">If you want to have something that feels expensive an exclusive you may want to consider thermography or blind embossing which both make the business card quite luxurious and definitely decadent.

If you're interested, I have some really good contacts in the industry and I'm sure I can help you out.

Thank you for your offer, however I live in the Netherlands and I am very busy with my studies and cant afford to drop by your London office :) I will have a look at your suggestion of thermography or blind embossing the cards. Do you have any further suggestions on the font or other ideas?

		<div class="commentbody">It’s strange that you are willing to pay for very expensive printing techniques, but then you want a free font.
Quality applies to printing as it applies to typeface design.
Anyway, about the design: your letters and words are too crowded. Nothing says "class" as a good use of whitespace.</div>

You make a good point as to my spending behavior, but it is difficult for me to justify purchasing fonts when there is already so a broad free offer. You can only spend money once so I always try to spend it wisely.

		<div class="commentbody">Personally I don't think thermography creates a high-end look. I associate it with lower-budget projects where someone wants the general look of embossing or engraving but can't afford the real thing.

I agree with Riccard0 that the type (especially the larger type) looks crowded. 

Regarding fonts, what fonts are used in your current signage, stationery, etc?  Normally you'd want your card to use the same fonts, unless you plan on re-doing those other items to match.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would say it's a better use of money to get some very nice, professional quality fonts than to put your money into unusual and expensive printing processes. If the thing you're printing isn't top quality, using a pricey printing method isn't going to make it look better. Of course, this is just my opinion — but I think it's something to consider.

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">If you intend to keep the same all-caps formatting, I might suggest letterspaced caps in one of the following:

Adobe Garamond (which I think has special display caps, at least in some versions, and a very nice italic)
Trajan (famously overused and often misused, but may be appropriate and effective here)
Perpetua Titling (looks similar to what you have)
Waters Titling (gorgeous)
Brioso Pro (for a little more personality)

Note that at least the first two faces mentioned above come free with InDesign, and maybe other Adobe software, so depending what program you're using, you may have them already.

Using small caps for the smaller text underneath the name, with oldstyle figures, will add a classier look. It looks like you may already have true small caps, but the osf will help. Letterspace everything more than feels necessary: for the name, you might start with 200 "units" (1000/em) = 20%.

Also, I sometimes find that using large small caps can be better than full caps in this kind of situation, as they're wider and seem to have a stronger stance. (I would use the small caps from the next optical size up, ideally.)

I hope this helps.

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I think thermography looks cheap, but we've had customers come through our shop who thought otherwise. I have one word for you: letterpress. Some classy letters punched so deep into a luxurious, thick paper that you can feel the valleys... Mmm...

<a href="http://www.bisonbookbinding.com/portfolio.php">Something like this</a>. In particular, check out the third card over, but don't go square like that one. I say, stick with standard-size business cards. </div>

If contributors started actually redesigning the business card or posting comp images and so on, I think I would agree with typenazi.</div>
