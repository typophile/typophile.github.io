  It will be released first for iPads. You'll place and arrange type on a press bed,
  lock the type, ink the type, and print. You can print your design or export to other
  applications.\r\n\r\nApparently the developer is trying to raise development funds
  through KickStarter. (I have no connection to this project; I just thought it looked
  interesting.)\r\n\r\nMore info and video demo: http://tinyurl.com/4tm2ke9\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letterpress_5295.jpg]"

  body: "I have trouble wrapping my  head around this. If it exports an image, then
    it will be useless for actually creating letterpress prints, unless it's a high-resolution,
    un-antialiased image that will be used to make a custom die, in which case the
    process really isn't any different from using any other software, cuteness aside.
    Right?\r\n\r\nIt says something about eventually wanting to acquire metal and
    wood type so people can actually create prints, but does that mean the program
    will email finished designs to a mothership and the mothership will ship finished
    prints to the user? In that case, I'd personally rather just go to my local print
    shop.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me understand this?"

    plates. You move the letters into place and print a \"fake letterpress\" printout
    on your inkjet or whatever. Or export an image that you could use in art projects
    or on a webpage.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the program will contain both pictures
    of the (backwards) wood type plus scans (vectorized?) of what each letter looks
    like printed.\r\n\r\nHe also mentions a later phase, where you'd be able to send
    your layouts electronically and their shop would actually set up the type and
    print it letterpress, then mail it to you (I wonder what they'd do if you sent
    them a layout with more \"Z\"s than they had actual type...)"

  body: "David, I think you've got it right. The plan is for them to take your iPad
    layout, set it up in wood and/or metal type, and print it using  the ink and paper
    you chose from their menu. It seems they're still trying to raise enough money
    to buy more type to offer users more variety (and so they're less likely to run
    out of <strong>Z</strong>s).\r\nWhat I like about the interface is that it shows
    users how letterpress works, and lets them experience (in a clean-fingered way)
    the limitations and the possibilities of the medium. And once LetterMPress is
    able to make printed copies, users can show all their hipster buddies what real
    printing looks like. "

    asking the public to donate 15,000 so they can setup a nice print shop with lots
    of wood type. In return, they promise to develop a silly ipad game you can use
    to order letterpress printed posters from said developers?\r\n\r\nSeems like a
    pretty clever business strategy.\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something?"

    design studio. The CPU could be deliberately overheated to simulate burning your
    hand on the waxer. X-acto blades could be wedged in the rubber around the bezel
    so iPad users can experience the thrill of cutting their fingers all the time.

    the economics aren't even that good. We can assume 20% of the apps collect 80%
    of the revenue (I'd guess it's even more skewed than that). That means the other
    80% of the apps (52,000) share 20% of the revenue ($400M), which is less than
    $8K per app. And the original $2B is a 31-month number, so it's even less than
    $8K annually.\r\n\r\nProbably it would be more profitable for these folks to just

    but those hobbyists aren't asking strangers for $15,000 for the chance \"to make
    a few hundred bucks.\" The lack of meaningful accountability in the Kickstarter
    system \u2014 donors don't get ownership, they don't get interest payments \u2014
    means that it tends to attract good-natured grifters.\r\n\r\nThough maybe I'm
    looking at this the wrong way. I could be using Kickstarter to fund some new,
    expensive hobbies of my own. For instance, that 3-week luxury cruise to Antarctica.
    Uh, I mean \u2014 my photography project investigating global climate change."

    funding method for artistic projects. My guess is that an app like LetterMpress
    would appeal to a fairly small group of users and thus self-funding its development,
    including spending thousands for original wood type, just wouldn't happen without
    some kind of underwriting.\r\n\r\nDoes the project leader have devious ulterior
    motives?  I dunno, but he seems to spell out pretty clearly what he's using the
    funds for, so potential donors can decide for themselves. \r\n\r\nPersonally I'm
    not planning to donate anything, but if the app gets made I'd certainly buy a
    copy if the cost was reasonable. It looks pretty cool."

  body: What confuses me though I love this idea, is how many people are actually
    going to order output? and if that's a very small number, then it's just a toy
    that does not need the actual fonts behind it, just the images. Collecting images
    of wood type would be cheaper, the acquisition of type being only the beginning
    of the expenses for this product's fonts. Someone like me would gladly give them
    images of my wood type, (though most of it is so big, not a word would fit on
    an iPad screen).

    owners instinctively flock to. If priced in the $5.99-$9.99 range the app will
    probably sell like hotcakes. I'm not sure, however, how the "get your design printed
    for real" thing will do, but I'm willing to bet that a bugfixed version of the
    current beta could probably raise the $15000 needed to stock a wood type letterpress
    shop without the need to beg for venture funding.
