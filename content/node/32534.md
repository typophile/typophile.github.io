  design. For my final project, duration of 1 academic year, I shall attempt to expose
  the significance of the space in typographic design, starting from exploring form
  & counterform, then moving onto figure and ground, foreground and background and
  finally object and environment. \r\n\r\nSeeing as there are many of you who are
  absolutely fanatical about type and design I would greatly appreciate if you could
  put your views across about the importance of space when using type. Also, if you
  have done any experimental work on this subject I would be very interested in seeing
  it - or if you have any other information (exhibitions, articles, books etc) that
  you might think it would be useful.\r\n\r\nAt present I have done an extensive amount
  research and have read many books. If anyone is keen on this subject I'll be happy
  to give you reading references an other materials I've come across.\r\n\r\nI look
  forward to hearing from you all.\r\n"

  body: "Ana,\r\nSpace is an equal and integral partner in both typeface design and
    page layout of typography. The two forces of positive and negative require each-other
    to exist. I am not sure what is meant by experimental work since all work has
    some degree of it. Gui Bonsieppe of the Ulm School (Hocheschool Fur Gestaltung,
    Ulm), published an article in about 1958 in the Ulm Journal about the use of space
    in layout and how it improves comprehension. I wish I could find my copy for you!
    There have been numerous experimental movements in typography from DaDa, Bauhaus,
    Russian Constructivists, Swiss Modernists, and many more contemporary ones that
    have pushed the space and interaction threshold. \r\nIs there some specific notion
    you are looking at?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    body: "thank you for your reply Chris. I probably haven't made myself clear enough.
      I'm new to these forums. When I said 'experimental work' I guess I was referring
      to for example the works of Sandberg, Peter Willberg and more recently the alphabet
      created by Mathias Schweizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have done an extensive amount of
      research not only about space in typographic design but i have also tried to
      compare it to use of space in fine art such as Matisse's paper cut outs, installations
      by Rachel Whiteread, type design 'miniscule' by Thomas Hount-Marchard etc.\r\n\r\nTo
      my way of thinking, space is the core quintessential of typographic letterforms
      and typographic design. My aim is to visually express my statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
      far I have broken down some existing fonts such as Bebmo & Gill and created
      a typology of that font.\r\n\r\n"

    a lot. If the typophile 'search' function is still down, do a Google search starting
    with the web site, like the following\r\n\r\ntypophile: notan\r\n\r\nYou could
    also start with the relevant terms in the typowiki. \r\n\r\nThen do join the conversation

    of the alphabet, the invention of the word is the single most important invention

    corpus. Even in cultural-historical literature the concept of the word does not
    make an appearance. I had to seek out the invention of the word on my own from
    reproductions of old manuscripts. If I can rely upon the dating of their origins,
    then the word appears to have been invented in Ireland in the first half of the

  body: "Kris, \r\n\r\nNoordzij's history is not really correct, or at least is misleading.
    Hebrew and I believe other semitic languages had word spacing all along--you can
    see it in the Dead Sea Scrolls and even more ancient stuff. The Irish were re-introducing
    word spacing, not inventing it. Apparently with vowels--which Greek and Latin
    used and Hebrew did not--it is more possible to read without word spacing. \r\n\r\nI
    got into a discussion via e-mail with Peter Enneson and Gerrit Noordzij about
    this, and ended up quoting to them the rules from the Talmud--well before the
    9th century--specifying precisely how much to space words and letters.\r\n\r\nSo
    the Irish monks were re-introducing word spaces, and I would think were probably
    aware of Hebrew, Syriac, etc, which used them. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the reintroduction
    was, as Noordzij says, a big deal. I recently saw the exhibition of early Bible
    manuscripts here at the Smithsonian museum, and it was thrilling to see the great
    jump in readability of the Carolingan minscule--in the hand of Alcuin himself!--and
    the introduction of word spaces by those Irish monks. \r\n\r\nAna, when you cut
    up the letters and re-arrange parts you are destroying the 'notan' that is there
    (strongly) in Bodoni. \r\n\r\nMark, you're right. Sorry for my sloppiness, I didn't
    check carefully. \r\n"

  body: "I don't understand the Bodoni experiment. What instructions did you give
    them? Was there an objective they were to work towards?. Years ago, when I taught
    design, I gave students enlrged segments of typeset lines that were cut into abstractions.
    We used them to discuss spacial interaction without interference from word meaning.
    We used different typeface and noted the interaction of dark and light space variatrion

      to find out not only how a person will construct a letterform but also where
      it will be placed on A4 page. This was a very simple experiment, you might think
      even childish, but  it was very interesting to see how designers react when
      asked to put a letterform together. Some were nervous because they struggled
      with what looks like a simple task, some took a long time and some appeared
      frustrated with themselves. '

    is great, and I wish you well. I also would like to point out that type made for
    reading, has three distinct \"grounds.\" Wheather one considers white space inside
    or outside of the letter, \"ground\" is clearly one thing, Among the forms, on
    the other hand, I consider those that repeat with any sort of frequency, like
    the main stems of H, E, L and P for example, as a secondary background against
    which the unique forms play. It is the unique forms then, like bottom of j or
    bar of H that are what we read with, and by the way design with. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
