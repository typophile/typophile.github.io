  splendid <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=styles\">Dolly</a>
  as the main typeface. While I don't mind it at larger sizes, I'm after something
  to compliment it for both story titles, and the book title as used on the cover.
  \r\n\r\nI've got no real requirements other than something with plenty of character,
  and perhaps some stronger/harsher lines to contrast with Dolly's multitude of curves.\r\n\r\nAll
  thoughts/suggestions welcome!\r\n\r\nJez"
