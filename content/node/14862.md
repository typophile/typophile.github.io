  body: "The UPS typeface is indeed a reverse engineered FF Dax with an FF Meta-style
    lowercase 'g'. The fact that we denounce this case of intellectual property theft
    makes us liable for prosecution. What a botched-up world, innit? The thieves go
    free, and the ones who just talk about it get busted.\r\n\r\nBert, although they
    are by the same type designer -- [[Hans Reichel]] -- <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=sari\"

    thieves make money from their stealing and can afford big lawyers.  Those who
    cry fowl are just low-life type designers who can't afford high-priced legal threads
    to weave a defense let alone a suit of armour.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
