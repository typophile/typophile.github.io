body: "I've been working on a new logo for a firm of independent mortgage brokers
  and financial consultants. The company work mostly within the construction and property
  sectors, and their name was made up from scratch, having no real meaning.\r\n\r\nThey
  wanted something clean, corporate, and professional, and a logo that would inspire
  confidence in their clients.\r\n\r\nI'm only working in black for now, but would
  appreciate any feedback, particularly on the choice of typeface. I wanted a face
  that would reflect the simplicity and geometric nature of the 'EC' icon, but the
  more I look at it the more I'm unsure that Bank Gothic is right.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ec_logo_4169.jpg]"

  body: I like the mark a lot! As for the type, I understand why you chose bank gothic,
    its based on geometric forms, however, it was designed quite some time ago (Bauhaus
    era) and has an indefinable 'old' quality to it...at least in the eyes of designers
    :)...if you want to use a 'squarish' geometric face I would recommend something
    like the new H&FJ face <a href="http://www.typography.com./fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041">Forza</a>
    or you can go with typefaces that are slightly more humanistic in nature as opposed
    to the technical/mechanical look and feel of Bank Gothic or FB Agency, such as
    <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/klavika/">Klavika</a>, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/sentico-sans-dt/">Sentico
    Sans</a> or <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/klint-lt-pro/">Klint
    pro</a>. The last kind of faces I would recommend would be the geometric sans
    of late such as Gotham, Proxima Nova or other similar faces (do a MyFonts search
    for geometric sans).
