  logo, ive trawled threw hundreds of fonts and not found much that look relevant\r\n\r\nThe
  company name is \"hypernumbers\", it plans to be the de facto standard for sharing
  numbers 'doing for numbers what hypertext did for text' \r\n\r\nI quite like elegant
  fonts, usually stick to serif, but with this it does need to be quite modern and
  technical\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://arandomurl.com/stuff/Logo.jpg\">Current Samples</a>
  is what I have found so far, I prefer 1 the most (KofiPure), particularly the quircky
  descender on y, but it does looks quite chunkily constructed, 2 (Avance) is a font
  i love, but overuse, and it doesnt quite fit, the other I just came across, i quite
  like it, but certainly not convinced\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any suggestions
  on faces or even places to look\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDale"

    Avance</a>."
