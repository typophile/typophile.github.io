  body: That may be the only weight that has a serif 'I'. Monotype Grotesque <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/monotype_grotesque_std_by_adobe_complete_vp/?sample_text=Isengard&sample_size=74">varies
    quite a bit</a> between weights and the Black seems even more related to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/bell_gothic_std_complete_vp/">Bell
    Gothic</a>. See also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/griffith_gothic/">Griffith
    Gothic</a>.
