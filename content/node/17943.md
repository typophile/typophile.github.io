body: 'Is there a standard to which most fonts are designed, in which I can set up
  a certain grid in [[Adobe Illustrator|illustrator]] where the points magically line
  up to the grid? My grid is set every 100pt  with 10 subdivisions. Then I set the
  type at 1000pt and convert it to outlines. Still, the points land somewhere else. '

    possible answer: Most fonts are produced on a 1000 units per em (PostScript) or
    2048 units per em coordinate system.'
