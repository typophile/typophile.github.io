body: Can anyone point me toward some resources on subtitling for film?  I&#39;m looking
  mostly for theory and current usage trends, but some info on research and development
  would be terrific too. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I can find it out there, but I thought
  some of you might be able to help lessen the tedium.
