  create a new logo for a small Volunteer Services department at a university. They
  want something simple, clean, and somewhat \"tech\"-y since their tagline at the
  moment is Wired for Service. Any suggestions for improvement/comments/etc. would
  be much appreciated."

  body: "If this is a department of a larger University, does it make sense, from
    the University's brand perspective, to have a completely unique logo?\r\n\r\nI
    suppose that's the big picture.\r\n\r\nIf we want to focus on the smaller bits,
    then I would have \"Volunteer\" and \"Services\" in the same cap style \u2013\_either
    all upper & lowercase, or all caps, but not both.  None of these logos carry much
    of a sense of warmth, which would seem appropriate for a volunteer organization.
    \ The tagline should provide additional sense about the group, not simply echo
    the logo (and vice versa).  "

    if anything -- should get more emphasis.

  body: "The marks on the left side look very generic and almost as if little thought
    was put into their meaning. The top-right looks better suited to a television
    station or monitor company. I agree with Henry that \"SERVICES\" should not be
    set in all-caps.\r\n\r\nI'd rethink the mark, maybe incorporating a wire of some
    sort into the design. What about the university's regular logo but drawn loosely
    with a squiggly line to represent the wire?\r\n\r\n - Lex"
