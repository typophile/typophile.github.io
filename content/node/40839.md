  moving here I bought a 1982 Chevy P/U short / step. The goal is to put a touch screen
  monitor into a custom dash and have a carputer. I'll be designing the program that
  integrates all the electronics together (satellite radio, GPS, DVD playback, etc)
  \r\n\r\nI was browsing the web for Christmas presents and stumbled across this <a
  href=\"http://www.originalpenguin.com/\">site</a>. I really like the font they use
  in their logo (quite retro looking I thought) and would like to use it - or at least
  something very similar - for the main interface logo. \r\n\r\nAny help identifying
  this font or alternative retro font sources (40s, 50s and 60s cinema type font in
  particular) would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDanny.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nBefore
  posting this thread - I read both your FAQs on Type IDing. I am not sure if I overlooked
  something but \"!!! PLEASE READ THIS FIRST !!! Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ
  states: \r\n\r\n<cite>Do I need to register to post a type ID request?\r\nNot at
  all: this is a public posting area. If you are a \u201Creturning customer\u201D
  it\u2019s nicer if you register of course. What the heck, it\u2019s free!</cite>\r\n\r\nI
  was not able to post a thread to the forum without first registering. Just thought
  I would bring this to your attention. \r\n\r\n"

    logo? I had suspected as much since all my attempts to find something turned out
    negative. Thank you all for the suggestions on retro fonts - some of them actually
    look promising. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nDanny."
