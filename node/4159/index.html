		<div class="commentbody">Emilie - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As mentioned, the vinyl cannot be removed with success but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it does however stick to many surfaces. I'm guessing you'll <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be sticking it to plaster or sheetrock walls - which it will do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with ease. In fact, we used to have it on the walls of our  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->old apartment. White on white walls can look nice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We used Fast Signs. Basically the Kinkos of vinyl. There are two <!-- raw HTML omitted -->main grades - normal and heavy duty. The heavy duty will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->work outdoors and they claim it even sticks to cement.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wouldn't suggest that, but the museum I used to work for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has had the same vinyl on sheetrock walls for years.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Usually you can just send an Illustrator eps of your artwork. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be mindful of the sizes the shop has as it can dramatically alter the price.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are many grades and suppliers of vinyl for signage.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are removable or low tack vinyl and vinyl that that is extremely permanent that it is used for identification on jet airliners. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would suggest that you talk to a number of sign companies that specialize in vinyl cut signage about the cost and your application use. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Depending on the amount of copy an alternate would be to print out the copy on your printer and use that as a template for cutting or tracing to the walls.
