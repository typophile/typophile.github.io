  body: Thanks, I appreciate the input but neither one of them is from LD or any of
    the other scrapbook font foundries that I could find at least. I&#39;ve been researching
    it for about 5 days now. A client loves them and wants to use them for a new website
    and I can&#39;t seem to convince her to use anything else.

    with even the lowest on the display font evolutionary scale, the Scrappin&#39;
    font. . . <BR> <BR>The font you are looking for is called CK Gala: <a href="http://www.creatingkeepsakes.com/shop/item_examples.ihtml?prod_id=CDACL"
    target="_blank">http://www.creatingkeepsakes.com/shop/item_examples.ihtml?prod_id=CDACL</a>
    <BR> <BR>It is distributed by Creating Keepsakes as part of an absurb collection
    of something like 50 fonts for $36. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll find the
    other font in one of these CDs as well. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D'

  body: Thanks so much. I didn&#39;t even know that Creative Keepsakes sold their
    own fonts. I thought they sold them through LD. I think its the only place I didn&#39;t
    look &#40;of course!&#41;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    fonts as Stuart I woulda caught this one. Haha.
