  posts. I decided to finally get an account. My first question on the forum is:\r\n\r\nwhat
  is the difference between a [[solidus]] and a [[virgule]]?\r\n\r\nI believe a solidus
  is a fraction mark and a virgule is the plain old slash, is this correct? Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian"

  body: According to Bringhurst, yes. Solidus is a more angled slash used for fractions
    (the term derived from a roman coin).

  body: "True solidus from Roman.\r\n\r\nEngland has it because the Romans came here
    and '/' is a shilling. // two slashes with a bar through it is a libra, a measure
    of weight or curreny (looks similar to # that the americans call 'pound sign').
    Hence the \xA3 is the current form of the 'pound sterling'. \r\n\r\nAnd in typography
    the stacked fractions were called 'nut' fractions since they were often on the
    'nut' or 'en space' and the lining ones often called 'shilling fractions'. "
