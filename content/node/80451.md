body: "[Fontlab Studio 5] I'm building a font that is small caps, in other words,
  all the letters are uniform in width. I meticulously kerned the lowercase first,
  and I'd like to apply to lowercase kerning to the uppercase, which I did using kerning
  classes, i.e. _kern1: a' A\r\n\r\nHowever, I would also like that same kerning to
  apply to the Uppercase-to-Uppercase, i.e. the kerning from fa to be the same as
  FA. \r\n\r\nUsing the classes, and putting a' A in the same class seems to only
  apply the kerning to Fa, and not FA.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
