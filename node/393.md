body: Hello everyone - iam new to the board. Can anyone help with the following query.
  <BR> <BR>I have picked up a version of Fontographer 4.1.2 and am trying to import
  illustrator eps files of a logotype I have just developed into fontographer. However
  the &#39;import eps&#39; option appears not to work due to lack of memory, no matter
  how much i allocate to the programme, and a simple cut and paste of the ill. vectors
  just gives a greyed out guide in fontographer. <BR> <BR>Is there any way to use
  the ill. vector AW without having to redraw the characters in Fontographer.  <BR>
  <BR>Any help greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Matt

    <BR> <BR>Here you can find the complete manual of Fontographer. <BR>EPS documents
    you can&#39;t directly import. <BR>The best way to &#39;import&#39; a glyph is
    with copy/paste. Make sure the settings are set to copy in PICT format. I&#39;m
    a Freehand user but I heard that it&#39;s possible in Illustrator to change the
    settings. <BR> <BR>Good luck <BR>Ren

  body: Try saving the eps file as an older version. I think illustrator 7 will work.
    Just to be safe though you could choose &#34;illustrator 1.1.&#34; It should import
    then.  My guess is you&#39;re trying to import AI9 or 10 files, right?

  body: 'Matthew, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m something of a Fontographer newbie, but I believe
    you should be using an older version of Illustrator, such as 5 or 6, to copy your
    logo &#40;I use version 6 and it works just fine&#41;. I think the problem is
    that from version 7 onwards, they made changes to the way Illustrator works with
    the clipboard. Actually, there is even an older typophile thread about this very
    topic: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/1479.html?1024492172"

    <BR> <BR>here&#39;s another tip: once you get an older version of Illustrator
    to work with, don&#39;t just press Command-C to copy your logo/glyphs, press Option
    and go to the Copy command in the Edit menu. Then go to Fontographer and use the
    Paste command in the Edit menu. This is advice given in the Fontographer manual
    and also in Chank&#39;s tutorial, which I recommend: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.chank.com/howto/"
