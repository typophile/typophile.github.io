    made don't emphasize your caracters, on the contrary. Otherwise the site looks
    well.

  body: "Thanks for the input kuroneko and alepaul.\r\n\r\nI'm mainly curious about
    peoples perception of the illustrations, \r\nwhich is why I posted the link. I
    guess you either love or hate \r\nthis aesthetic. Much of it can certainly be
    seen as 'bad, cheesy' \r\nbut also I think 'good, kitsch'.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to
    avoid vectors and 3D seems a good starting point, \r\nalthough it carries a lot
    of baggage and it's not a particularly \r\n'cool' style at the moment.\r\n\r\n>the
    illustrations you\u2019ve made don\u2019t emphasize your caracters...\r\n\r\nI
    guess what I'm trying to do, in some ways, is create images \r\nthat make lettering
    interesting and evocative to a wider audience, \r\nrather than just designers.
    I love stark, simple, black and white \r\nimages but I also like the other extreme.
    Vivid, complex and colourful."

  body: I understand your point of view and I really hope you will continue to experiment
    this way. My critic was only based on my personnal tastes which is based on my
    so called strict, minimalist swiss visual culture. So I'm not really impartial
    and the fact I don't appreciate something don't means it's bad. Plus, even if
    I'm not a fanatic of this style, it's evident that your illustrations are really
    well done and that you work quiet a lot on them. So, goodnight and good luck!
