    when you look closely it becomes 3D, because you can actually only see the shadows
    if you know what I mean..\r\nI might add some colour to is anyway.. I just put
    it in here in dark grey so that you're unbiased in terms of colours\r\n\r\nI'd
    also like to add a wordmark but i've got no idea which font would fit.. I've tried
    a few already but none seemed to work\r\n\r\ncheers, mike"

    very much contrived web1.0 era online branding. Fake words for fake business models.
    ;0)\r\n\r\nIf you like blue, and seven, why not simplify it to something like:\r\n\r\nblooseven\r\nblu7\r\nblue7\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAdded
    bonus is that 'blue seven' has an obvious logo solution. ;o)\r\n\r\n-Darrel"

    nicer weight to it.

    for my taste and for my approach of design.. imo\r\nis boob such a bad association?

  body: "The concept for this latest post is nice, however I think you need to work
    on the actual drawing more, the curve of the b counter needs some work especially
    around approximately 4 o\u2019clock and at either end, the horizontals and verticals
    of the b and 7 need a more geometric and symmetric feel, maybe creating a 3d solid
    version and then removing the unwanted elements might help. On the name it has
    an onomatopoeic quality, a kind of rounded sound, I think that it might require
    more rounded forms, maybe you could emphasise roundness of the corners.\r\nTim"

  body: "well.. I just wasn't really satisfied for some reason so I went back to the
    drawing board.. I've played around with very minimalistic shapes of a b and the
    number 7 and this is what came out..\r\nAt the top you can see the idea behind
    the logo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bloob_new_5699.jpg]\r\n\r\npersonally,
    I'm pretty satisfied (for the moment) because it's a much more energetic and dynamic
    piece which fits me better than the Uber-serious look from before because I'm
    only 22\r\nPersonally I like A) the best.. It has got a touch of blue (bloo) and
    symbolizes an idea and/or graphic solution that just popped into my mind but the
    whole could also stand for a (design) factory with the blue part being the top
    of a chimney. \r\n\r\nany comments?!\r\nI'm also looking for an accompanying font..
    any ideas?\r\n\r\ncheers mike"

      a bolder and squatter type would work better."
