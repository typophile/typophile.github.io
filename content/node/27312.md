  and want to use a more modern geometric sans. Along the lines of Gotham, with a
  range from condensed to extended. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nAppreciate any input! Happy
  Friday!"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html\" target=\"_blank\">proxima
    nova</a> could fit, but it hasnt got a extended, only normal, condensed and extra
    condensed\u2026 thats what <a href=\"http://typographi.com/001045.php\" target=\"_blank\">typographi.com</a>
    wrote about it:\r\n<cite>Proxima Nova takes all that is good from faces such as
    Gotham, Neutraface, Futura, and Akzidenz Grotesk, and leaves what\u2019s bad behind.
    It nestles neatly in a place between the geometric, grotesque, and gothic. Its
    generous x-height, thoughtfully balanced color, and expert typographic features
    (small caps, text figures, lining figures, etc.) position it as a prime candidate
    for extended textual setting. This is definitely Mr. Simonson\u2019s tour de force.
    I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Proxima Nova pop-up in the next major magazine
    redesign. \u2014 Kyle Hildebrant</cite>\r\n\r\nand what about <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2090/avenirnext.html\"

  body: I guess I don't quite understand why geometric faces such as these really
    need an extended version. They're already wide enough. Gotham is quite a wide
    face already.

  body: "i dont like extended faces anyway. i can see the use of a condensed cuts,
    but for an extended? i havent come across an extended cut that didnt look goofy
    and wrong to my eyes.\r\n\r\n(of course, there are uses for them. i'd just rather
    design differently than use an extended cut)\r\n\r\n\r\n(notoriousD, sorry for
    posting offtopic in your thread\u2026 i couldnt resist)\r\n"

  body: "My thoughts for using an extended face is to provide a little variety to
    the template...mainly used on \"headline\" copy. The wider letterforms can provide
    a unique, progressive feel that will create a modern edge that the publisher wants.\r\n\r\nI
    found <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay\">Relay</a> which is by
    far my favorite... a little pricey. But worth the cash!\r\n\r\nThanks so much
    for the suggestions!"
