body: "Dear all (and especially those of you familiar with cyrillic)\r\n\r\nMaking
  italics for a typeface that also contains the cyrillic letter ghe stroke, I am having
  difficulties finding any information on what the (lower case) italic version of
  this letter looks like.\r\nIs it just a slanted version of the upright, or does
  it follow the rule of ghe (and in that case: how is the stroke applied), or is it
  something third?\r\n\r\nYour help will be very much appreciated."
