  body: "A logo from the pre-digital era. AFAIK it has not been made into a digital
    font.\r\nAs for something similar, I looked for fonts with about the same degree
    of squareness and width of vertical and horizontal stokes. Found very little,
    but consider FF District Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFDistrictMedAsFuji_3515.gif]
    https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/district/ as a very distant relative. A
    mirrored _J_ could resemble _L_ and if the new _L_ was flipped vertically it could
    be the basis for the _F_. A clipped _U_ could become a _J_.\r\nDon"

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/ which has similar curved strokes
    for _U_ and _J_.\r\nDon"

  body: "Reminds me a lot of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/univers|Univers]] and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers-lt|Linotype Univers]]. Something
    like Univers Black should give you a good base for customization. \r\nTalking
    about 'Univers', try maybe having a look to [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm|Kasse]]
    FLF (Kasse Ultra looks promising), a digital version of [[http://typophile.com/node/69556|Modula]],
    an old film font close to Univers but a bit more contrasted.\r\nQuick comparaison,
    top logo/bottom scaled Kasse Ultra\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5463.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
    option to consider is [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/serpentine|Serpentine]]/([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/serpentine-sans|Serpentine
    Sans]] with more work on /J though."
