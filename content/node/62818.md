  body: "That was the first one I tested. It's quite similar, but the type on the
    picture seems quite a lot heavier. Maybe that'll just do though. I'm still curious
    if they made a heavier-than-black cut of helvetica in the 70's or if it was made
    heavier by hand?\r\n\r\nSv."

    image in Photoshop, reset the type in Helvetica Neue Black, laid it on top, and
    it appears to be a match (the weight seems the same)"
