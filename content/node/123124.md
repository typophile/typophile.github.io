  body: "Confirming your hunch, not a font to me as well, rather a custom logo work
    and possibly heavily customized.\r\nI'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/sackers-roman|Sackers
    Roman]] Heavy:\r\n- adding an outline stroke to embolden it and to round corners\r\n-
    reconstruct /O (the only real custom part of this logo to me) from /U left spurred
    quarter, mirroring vertically once, merging the 2 parts, mirroring horizontally,
    merging, done\r\n- add a rough/grunge/eroded/vintage post-treatment: the 2 /T
    treatments are different meaning the lettering has been treated globally and does
    indicate the lettering does not come treated"

    font\" feature work to ID this font?\r\n"

  body: "No, haven't used it for years and notoriously un-accurate (potentially part
    of their business model). I use only [[http://www.whatfontis.com|WhatFontiS]]
    when I lack alternative suggestions and it has always been of a big help.\r\nThis
    spurred /U was the earmark and rang the bell of Sackers Roman. /S looked also
    very close so decided to share my thought about it."
