  it. I know I used it once before but it has been years since I have seen it. If
  anyone has any ideas I would love to hear them.  The image shows the cog after I
  converted to 3D.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nChris[img:sites/default/files/old-images/COG3D_3894.jpg]"

  body: "I don\u2019t know the name of the font, but the OSX application ArtText has
    a gear in its library of vector shapes. It\u2019s in the Symbols category. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    easy to create a gear in a drawing program with oblongs, circles and path operations
    such as Illustrator's Pathfinder filters.\r\n \r\nDraw an oblong, duplicate, select
    all and combine to form a cross. \r\nDuplicate the cross, revolve by 45\xB0, select
    all and combine. This creates an 8-pointed star. \r\nDraw a circle, place on top
    of the \u2018star\u2019 shape, select all and subtract."
