    Try this [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ionic_6509.jpg]\r\n_Darby's_ looks
    like a heavier version of Ionic.\r\nAnyway I have not found a font with an exact
    match to the center stroke on the _a_ of _Darby's_. However you could use News
    701 BT and most people would not notice the difference.\r\nDon"

    a trifle thick. But this might just be an effect of the larger size of the test
    specimen. If it is in fact thicker than the image for ID there is Sentinel Book,
    which I did not test.\r\nDon"
