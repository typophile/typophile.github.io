  endeavors. Nothing I expect to make a billion dollars off  of, but, I think it's
  going well. Some people probe me to consider fonts, colors, visuals, etc. Im not
  sold on the idea, but it has its purpose I suppose. I started looking into this
  and came across a few that I like.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any insight as to what
  the attached fonts may be?"

    In fact enough purpose to hire a trained/experienced person to help you.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure you'll get IDs on those fonts, but -especially since they're so different-
    it's important to focus on what message the typography (which BTW is only part
    of the puzzle) should convey (as opposed to simply choosing a font you personally
    like).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, \r\n\r\nI completely understand what you're saying. Which is why I
    thought it beneficial to perhaps get some idea of what class/family these fonts
    that caught my eye belonged to as a means to study how they're typically used
    and further investigate why I like them. \r\n\r\nThen, if I decide to care about
    a format, I can bring more than vague indesicion to a trained professional.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    my initial message was a bit too thorough. in the future should I just say \"help
    me with this font pleaseeee!!\" ? I see that seems to work...."

    do be thorough! And most of all please don't resort to teenspeak.  :-)\r\n\r\nYour
    first example is just handwriting; there's at least 3 billion fonts like that.
    The second one I'm not sure how to categorize, but I can tell you that House Industries
    is crawling with stuff like that. As for your third one, you might try \"Art Deco\"
    as a search term on MyFonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
