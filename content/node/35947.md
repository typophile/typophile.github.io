body: "\r\nI thought I would just throw this basic question out to see what kind of
  feedback I get. I'm currently working on a vitamin label and the client requests
  that the small product description copy be justified. When the column is justified
  there are a lot of rivers and funny spacing issues. What I typically will do with
  a line or lines with large gaps is just highlight that specific line in play with
  the tracking. I've always wondered if this is the correct thing to do. What would
  you suggest? I need to be enlightened. \r\n\r\nThanks."

    some of those rivers.

    and this sounds like a very narrow column, I'd be leery of doing so.  \r\n\r\nAnd
    tracking small print can get very ugly as well.\r\n\r\nIf I were you, I'd do up
    two -- one justified, and one ragged, and let the client decide which one looks
    \"better\": my guess is that they'd pick the ragged one...."

  body: "Thanks for the comments. I decided to do what Linda said about showing the
    client the two versions. I think I can persuade them into the ragged version.
    It's much more comfortable to read. \r\n\r\nBut I still don't want to give up
    on learning to create nice fully justified columns. I've never really learned
    how to fine tune them. That's always bugged me. Could it have something to do
    with the justification settings (word spacing, letter spacing)? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to avoid rivers. Normally this is an editors' perogative but some will allow you
    to make a suggestion. Just make sure they explicitly approve it.\r\n\r\n(And thinking
    about it ... for drug information copy, I probably wouldn't dare making text changes.
    More likely than not, it was written by lawyers.)"

    sizes (both font and column width), it makes a huge difference, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>But
    I still don\u2019t want to give up on learning to create nice fully justified
    columns.</em>\r\n\r\nDepending on the text, hyphenation is usually the first resort,
    particularly if you're able to keep it to a minimum, but there's a really fine
    line to draw between too many hyphens (particularly in a row) and the academic
    level of the text you're working on.  You don't want to end up hyphenating long
    words all the time, because that's hard on your reader, and if it's a more accessible
    text, hyphenating short words is distracting as well.\r\n\r\nThat being said,
    and depending on the font/size/column you're using, you don't want to mess around
    extensively with word and letter spacing that much either.  I am reminded of the
    comment quoted in <em>The Joy of Cooking</em> that is attributed to Lao Tsu: <em>Ruling
    a large kingdom is like cooking a small fish. Both need to be treated gently and
    not overdone.\" </em>  ;-)"

  body: Text with a lot of long words can be a problem to justify in any setting,
    but generally if you have lines more than about two alphabets (i.e. 56 characters)
    wide, they will justify nicely in InDesign with paragraph composer turned on,
    hyphenation set to maximum two in a row (three in a pinch), minimum three letters
    before and after hyphen, hyphenate capitalized words, and word spacing set to
    85% min., 100% normal, and 130% max. (no letter spacing allowed). You still have
    to do some manual tweaking, but this gives decent results. As your column of text
    narrows, you have to allow more leeway on the parameters and accept that it won't
    be quite as attractive. Below about one and a half alphabets (42 characters per
    line), I set it ragged right unless it's very short and I have carte blanche to
    rewrite the text.
