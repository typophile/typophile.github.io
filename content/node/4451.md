  body: Now that I think about this, would the post office have trouble reading such
    an ornamental script? If this is the case, can anyone reccomend a complementary
    serif?

  body: The font used  for the script looks like <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=203230"
    target="_blank">Citadel Script</a>. However, I agree that this would not be appropriate
    for addressing the envelopes.  My suggestion would be to use a legible Italic
    face from a serif font, or else a formal serif font &#40;preferably not Times

    something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/engravers-gothic/testdrive.html?s=75%20Gateshead%20Lane%20South&amp;p=36"

  body: Thanks Mike, you script hound. <BR> <BR>Engravers&#39; is nice. I was also
    looking at some high contrast extended faces. However, both ideas were nixed out.
    &#34;They look like a business letter!&#34; At the moment, they like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/SNLQ/F_SNLQ-10005000.jhtml">Snell</a>.

    Both from Agfa. <BR>
