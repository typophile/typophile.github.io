  as bold/heavy as possible, but also having high contrast between the thicks and
  thins. its kind of an experiment testing the relationship of the black and white.
  the serifs will be very thin, i want the glyphs to have a sexy fashionable look
  to it. so far, i have not found any project that matches this description. if you
  know of a certain typeface that is similar to what i'm describing, please share,
  so i may study it. thank you. "

    be what others have already done?

    isolation. I think I was just in a hurry because this is for a class and there
    is a time limit.\r\nAnd thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed the posters."

  body: "<blockquote>what is going on with the 'insert image' option?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNothing
    good. I find it very temperamental and it only seems to work in particular browsers
    on particular days of the week, but I haven't figured out which ones. I use Chrome
    as standard and that does not like it but Safari works from time to time. I think
    there may also be a restriction on image pixel size with an upper limit of 500
    x 500. You should be able to display images hosted externally though."

    get much heavier or blacker than Ultra. And you don\u2019t get much more fashionable

  body: "In an educational context, I would say that the \uFB01rst fat faces (early
    19th century) and the \u201CUltra Bodonis\u201D of the early 20th century are
    worth studying, because the designers of these were pushing the limit of form
    experimentally. Commercial\u2019s Austin is more about the nuances of style\u2014targeting
    fashion magazines while alluding to the 1970s (e.g. Lubalin/Carnese\u2019s Fat
    Face).\r\n\r\nHas anybody designed a \u201CKlimax with serifs\u201D yet?\r\nIf
    not, it may be what you should try (emulating the principle, not the artefact)."
