  I just wrote a post about it for <A HREF=\"http://blog.crazyegg.com/2012/02/06/finding-the-right-font/\">The
  Daily Egg (Smashing Magazine Network)</A> and I would love to hear your opinions!
  \ \r\n\r\nI seem to have a particular attachment for Avenir. It's not as abundantly
  used as something like Helvetica but I find I can usually use it without any negative
  consequences- so it's great for situations where I don't have the time to experiment
  with new typefaces but still want the copy to look good.\r\n\r\nYour turn now! ;)"
