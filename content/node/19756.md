body: "I was just leafing through some of my old pre-Postscript specimen books and
  got nostalgic about some of the swash and alternate characters that got dropped
  during the initial conversions to Postscript.\r\n\r\nWith OpenType advanced features,
  many typefaces are becoming available with for use with alternates. Just thought
  I'd show you a few of the alternates that have been stash in the vaults... maybe
  they will make their way back.\r\n\r\nAll of these faces are currently available
  in digital format in one form or another. Please excuse some slight distortions
  as they were scanned from thickly bound books.\r\n\r\nThought some of you might
  have some fun just trying to identify their parent typefaces. (Samples added below)"

    yes, it helps to be \"old\" to remember this one.\r\n\r\nOne of my personal favorite
    type families (because of its eccentric qualities) is Goudy Sans, which at one
    point had more swash and alternate characters than ITC Avant Garde Gothic. Somewhere
    in my dusty vault I have specimens, but these characters were \"axed\" long ago
    when CG first licensed Goudy Sans to ITC, then subsequently Monotype took claim
    of licensing. Not sure if the lost alternates will ever be released again :-("

  body: Did CG do any marketing of Goudy Sans before it was licensed to ITC? I'm wondering
    if there may have been ads in, say, U&lc. that would show the lost characters.
    I've got nearly every issue.

    like it because it was too feminine and couldn't be used for more than very specific
    jobs. However, a few years ago I saw a letterpressed invitation which used it.
    It was gorgeous. Now I've been waiting for the opportunity to use it again.\r\n\r\nI'd
    love to see the swashes I hope you can find the specimens.\r\n\r\n(I should add

    have the ITC rights. It could be that everything needed is all in one place. Mind
    you, Goudy Sans doesn't seem to be terribly popular, so I don't know how worthwhile
    it would be for them.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "From what I recall (strictly from memory... somewhere, sometime I'll find
    my old notes if I didn't trash them), between 1982--1986 Compugraphic launched
    a major push to improve its digital library to support the high-end MCS Digital
    Imagesetters. This included significant cleanup of the older \"CG-lookalike\"
    faces in favor of licensing from originating foundries, release of exclusive designs
    like Shannon, Garth Graphic, Pasquale and a whole series of revivals which included
    Goudy Sans, Albertus, Hadriano, Schneidler (these previous four families were
    release between 1982-83) and more.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 we also launched an aggressive
    ad campaign and produced a special series of 11 x 17 \"Type Release\" posters
    for what we felt were high-profile families, in fact, twenty in all. I remember
    when doing the Goudy Sans poster (the backs had full character specimen samples)
    that I was amazed by all the cap swash alternates. The family was comprised of
    six faces -- Light, Light Italic, Medium, Medium Italic, Bold and Extrabold.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gs-postr3_6122.png]\r\nAll
    I can find so far is a smaller repro of only the front of the original Goudy Sans
    poster (shown above). On the back of the original poster there was full specimen
    showings of all available characters, though there may have been sample showings
    in a mid-eighties CG big type book.\r\n\r\nDuring the mid-to-late eighties, I
    got the word to \"retire\" the CG version of Goudy Sans, to be replaced by ITC
    Goudy Sans. This version had no alternates, and from what is written in the huge
    1994 <em>Agfa Type Reference Book for PostScript Users</em> is \"Designed by Fredric
    [Frederic] Goudy in 1929 and released by Elsener [Elsner] and Flake in 1986.\"
    Though on the <a href=\"https://ssl.kundenserver.de/www.elsner-flake-shop.com/sess/utn;jsessionid=15445d738e4c121/shopdata/product_search.shopscript?query=goudy%20sans&search_logical=and&content=suche&page=1&Filename=gsbk____.ttf&Code=EF1621-1&Family=Goudy%20Sans&Weight=Book&Layout=Text%20West&Designer=ITC%20Design%20Staff/Frederic%20W.%20Goudy&DesignYear=19,861,929&Trademark=International%20Typeface%20Corporation&content_kopf=fontvorschau&pattern=&startitem=0\"
    target=\"new\">Elsner+Flake</a> site, they attribute it to the ITC Design Staff.
    The ITC version had four weights with corresponding italics -- Book & Italics,
    Medium & Italics, Bold & Italics, and Black & Italics.\r\n\r\nBy the late eighties,
    CG and Monotype had established a relationship, and many more CG faces were \"retired\"
    and replaced by licensed versions directly from Monotype. You can see from the
    specimens shown below (from 1990 <em>Agfa Type Book</em>) that Goudy Sans retained
    a few alternates. (Thick book hard to flatten on scanner.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gs-MT3_5633.png]"
