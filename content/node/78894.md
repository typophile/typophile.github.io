  body: "On second thoughts, Organda doesn't have that E. In the Phil's Photo \"Homage
    To The Alphabet\" book there is a Cinema One, Cinema Two and Cinema Three that
    have the E and the 3D effect. It doesn't appear to be digitised and I haven't
    yet found a sample online. I can do you a scan from the book if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe
    links in my previous post are the closest you'll get. You can construct the E
    easily if you need to."

    much trouble :)\r\n\r\nOrganda & Toasted Vein are great decco faces too, i doubt
    i would've come across those without your help. Thanks again!"
