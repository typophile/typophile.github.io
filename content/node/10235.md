body: We&#39;ve got a flash project that we are trying to squeeze every cpu cycle
  out of. <BR>Obviously the best way to do this and get any form or decent quality,
  is to go with bitmaps, rather than vectors in low-quality mode. <BR>So we&#39;re
  looking to test the performance of greyscale fonts in Flash in low-quailty mode.
  <BR>If this works out I guess we&#39;ll have to investigate the next steps of building
  such a font, although after reading previous posts in this forum it might be a lot
  less painful to us if we outsouce it. <BR> <BR>So... we&#39;re looking for a demo
  greyscal bitmap font to be tested in flash MX 2004. <BR> <BR>Any offers ?

  body: 'Hold on. The Ultrafonts stuff is still outlines: they&#39;re pixelfonts,
    outline fonts designed to render out crisp anti-aliased type &#40;the best stuff
    to read onscreen&#41; at a single point size. I doubt they will render out faster
    &#40;although their lack of curves <i>might</i> make a slight difference&#41;.
    So I think Robert might be talking about one of the relatively new features of
    Flash: the ability to render out an internal actual bitmap font &#40;from an outline
    font&#41; and then use that instead; the problem is I think that doesn&#39;t work
    with grayscale - although I think it might depend on platform -not sure though.
    <BR> <BR>And a side question: what point size are you looking for? <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hmmm... was a bit worried about that. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re basically trying
    to get away from using vector fonts &#40;outlines fonts with or without &#39;clever&#39;
    hinting&#41;. <BR> <BR>Nor are we too worried about &#39;tiny&#39; fonts, but
    rather more traditional &#34;Arial&#39; derivatives at 12px, 14px and 18px. So
    there is no real worry about &#39;blurry&#39; visuals at very small font sizes.
    <BR> <BR>We are ONLY worried about performance issues. <BR> <BR>Ideally we would
    like to use &#39;low-quality&#39; mode fonts in flash and have the nice anti-aliased
    edges of &#39;high-quality&#39; mode. <BR> <BR>The only way I can see this happening,
    is if there is a bitmap font... the trick is... does flash support greyscale bitmap
    fonts or not... <BR> <BR>...if it does, all I really want to be able to do is
    convert a standard outline font into a greyscale one and use it in Flash. <BR>
    <BR>...if it doesn&#39;t, then there are 2 ways forward. <BR>1. Use standard 1
    bit fonts during high calculation areas, and then use high quality mode for notifications
    and interaction. &#42;ugh&#42; <BR>2. Use a bitmap based lookup graphic element
    table and chain &#39;words&#39; together. Just requires more programming I guess,
    and kerning goes right out the window. Then for the interactive areas, I would
    then switch to standard fonts in high quality mode. &#42;not so ugh, just more
    work&#42; <BR> <BR>I guess it all really depends on how thoroughly flash has embraced
    the relatively not-so-new TTF specification. &#42;heh&#42; <BR> <BR>Any further
    light ? <BR> <BR>Rob.

  body: Mana comes in 13&#42; and 16 PPEM - you can see them on the Ultrafonts site.
    It&#39;s probably not too expensive for you to buy them just to test; and if they
    don&#39;t work you might find a use for them in the future. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which
    actually has an Arial air to it, at least in the Regular lowercase. <BR> <BR>I
    think a decent fallback would be to use a 1-bit font, which I&#39;m pretty sure
    that new Flash feature can handle. But hopefully you can get grayscale to work.
    <BR> <BR>Do let us know what happens! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;ve had a quick look at Mana on Ultrafonts. <BR>Unfortunately if you
    right click and choose &#39;quality- low&#39; in the flash player, we go straight
    back to the beginning, and the fonts become very aliased. <BR> <BR>Is there no
    such thing as a font that contains no outline data, but only bitmap data ? <BR>Greyscale
    if possible ? <BR> <BR>All I&#39;m really looking for is a test greyscale bitmap
    ttf font to play with. It doesn&#39;t even have to have real glyphs in it. We&#39;re
    only interested in seeing if it works in Flash, and if there is any performance
    boost over standard outline fonts. <BR> <BR>Can anyone send us a &#39;demo&#39;
    greyscale bitmap ttf font to test ? <BR> <BR>Rob.

    an official answer from Macromedia? <BR>Only Flash MX technology can really guarantee
    a greyscale bitmap ttf good work on low quality mode. <BR> <BR>If Flash dont support
    this feature, and you decide to use high quality mode in font, i can do the development
    of your customised fonts designs, starting to send you a demo agreement for the
    proyect. Ultrafonts technology is the better solution actually available for greyscale
    fonts custom type design with a crossplatform ttf solution. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>
