body: "HI,\r\nI'm doing a font for Type 1 class. The idea was to get a hand-rendered
  feel, but with a cleaner look. Also I wanted to retian some 'old-style' elements
  suck as tick-thin difference on stems and some curvy tails.I'm having some problems
  with the S,X,Y, and Z.\r\nMuch feedback would be appreciated.\r\nThanks,\r\nElena"

  body: The darkening scribbles are not even through the letters. Starting the scribble
    later like you did with the A might make the H and others look more uniform and
    thus cleaner, imo.
