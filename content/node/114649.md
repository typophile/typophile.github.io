body: "Hello again, guys!\r\nI\u2019m with a new question for you. I like the so-called
  old-style numerals, with 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 having descenders, and 6 and 8 having
  ascenders. Also I like the Roman-like number 1 of fonts such as Bembo and Centaur.\r\nAccording
  to what I\u2019ve found searching on typefaces, the fonts Aldus, Arno, Bembo, Emerson,
  FF Scala, Goudy Old Style, Requiem and Sabon all feature old-style numerals, with
  Bembo, FF Scala, Requiem and Sabon showing the I like numeral for 1. Of these, I
  have Goudy Old and Sabon available in my PC, however the numerals are regular, nothing
  of old-style, only a slight overshoot of 4 and 7 in the Goudy Old. Also the 1 of
  Sabon is regular. Why? And where can I find some typeface that has truly old-style
  numerals?\r\nCan you help me, please?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"
