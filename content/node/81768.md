body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nIt's been quiet around Sensato for a while, but here
  it is again. Capitals have always been my weakest point, so I guess there is much
  to improve on. I decided to step away from the caps in Sensato A (the text/low-contrast
  variant) with the caps, so once I'm satisfied with these I'll adjust the caps in
  Sensato A accordingly. All feedback is much appreciated and will be carefully considered.
  \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sensato-Display2_5409.jpg]"

  body: "Hello :)\r\nIt looks very nice.\r\nI especially like your B C D Q S.\r\nHowever
    I'm not sure about some capitals that look totally <em>sans</em> like H I V. \r\nMaybe
    adding a little something at terminals? (You've done it for F T Z) L.\r\nBut maybe
    I'm totally wrong."

  body: a good question.. maybe add some stress, as in horizontal arms? (a bit like
    in Optima font)

  body: "When I visualise drawing these with a broadnibbed pen (which fits the type
    of font you aim for) there are some glyphs and parts of glyphs that stand out
    as being \u2018wrong\u2019, eg:\r\nthe tail of \\R\\, the descending part of \\y\\,
    the terminals of \\K\\ and \\k\\ which differ too much from \\A\\, the top left
    of \\N\\ which is way too blotchy.\r\n\r\nAlso the vertical ricght of \\G\\ isn\u2019t
    wide enough.\r\nThe angle of the left part of \\Y\\ is too steep.\r\nYou may want
    too take a closer look at \\W\\ and esp. \\w\\ because the relation between the
    two \u2018valleys\u2019 is off.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t try to emulate Optima \u2014
    I like the super-ellipsis-ish tension caused by the \u2018bulging\u2019 verticals.
    Maybe you should accentuate that and use it more.\r\n\r\nBTW. Are you using your
    May-vacation to work on this? The sun is shining!"

  body: "Hey! Thanks a lot! I've been waiting for a good portion of tough feedback.
    I'll try to improve on the weak spots you pointed out and come back with an update
    as soon as I'm seeing some improvement.\r\n\r\nI am using my May-vacation for
    Sensato, but I spend hours outside looking at the test prints in the sun, and
    I get my daily portion of football too, so no worries. I usually work on Sensato
    when it's dark outside.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean with 'bulging' verticals?"
