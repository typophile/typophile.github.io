body: "Marimekko is a Finnish company making textiles and clothing. They've been a
  minor success around the world, especially since Jacqueline Kennedy bought and wore
  their clothes in the sixties. Lately they were in the news, when they sued Dolce
  & Gabbana for copying their classic Unikko (Poppy) pattern.\r\n\r\nI updated their
  logo, and made two families reflecting the logo, which weas originally made in 1954
  from Olivetti typewriting. With both type and logo I would have liked to go further,
  but they wanted to keep fairly neutral look, so there you go.\r\n\r\nOld and new
