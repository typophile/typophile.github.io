  for a school project. We were given an insect that would have it's own exhibit at
  the Smithsonian and need to develop an identity for the insect we receive (the Moth
  in my case) - along with a piece that include the identity.\r\n\r\nI tried to simplify
  the Moth into just a few lines, and then went with some type that match the symbol
  (which happens to be Neutra Display in this case).\r\n\r\nThe name of the exhibit
  is \"Hidden Beauty\"...\r\n\r\nJust looking for some feedback thus far.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n "

  body: It's very nice, the only thing I would say is that the moth image looks more
    like a butterfly (moths and butterflies are hard to tell apart anyways). Still,
    with a moth you usually can't see the body, the wings cover it.

  body: Yeah both wings should be pointing down. That would make it more moth like.

  body: I've just had a look at some moth images, and although it does seem that the
    wings pointing down is more 'mothlike' i.e more recognisable as a moth, when their
    wings open, they do look more butterfly-like and seem to reveal their 'hidden
    beauty', so maybe this is something to consider?

  body: "moth is a rather ugly word to say, but when set in Neutra it really shines
    in print.\r\n\r\nAs for the mark, the fact that it says MOTH right next to it
    seems to make it look like a moth to me."

  body: Very nice, Mike -- I'm not generally a fan of Neutra but this is quite beautiful
    and very appropriate for the Smithsonian.

    for my monster movie. Some of those suckers are scary-looking.\r\n\r\nThe logo
    is quite stylized, but that's probably what you were going for, so thumbs up.\r\n\r\n
