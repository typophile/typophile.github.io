  body: I think Refrigerator is closer than the others you cited (and by a typophile)
    but it lacks the funky W and R of the sample.

  body: No! Of course I appreciate the suggestions. I don't have a specific use for
    this font but was really struck by it and hoped to find out its name in case I
    want to purchase it later. Hoped it was from some boutique foundry one of y'all
    know about that I don't.

  body: I think it might be a combo of Nicotine and Nicotine Jazz, but it's hard to
    tell from those small samples. Also reminds me of www.cape-arcona.com stuff. (Nope,
    close but no cigar :) It definitely looks "chank-ish" though.

  body: "Cape Arcona has some nice fonts and well priced, thanks for the tip.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think the R matches either Nicotine. It's definitely a font because it's
    used pretty extensively on the jacket, not just for the title. The designer is
    a friend of a friend so I may try to find out that way."

  body: You are correct. Not sure if it may be a different chank font, he's got some
    others that are similar (I think)...

    'Cachet'</a>, which has the R and W, but not quite the right S, and the C isn't
