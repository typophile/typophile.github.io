  Love the nuance of the R in relation to the other letters, as well as the borderline
  uniform stroke quality.\r\n\r\nCan anyone ID?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"

  body: "This appears to be the product graphic of the Speed Graphic logo.  Speed
    Graphic was the venerable camera of photo-journalists prior to the 35mm era. \r\nI
    doubt that there is an actual typeface to match.  There are several condensed
    light italic sans serifs that get close except for the R which you care about.
    \ Univers might give you a similar feel but it is not a match, for sure.\r\n\r\nHere
    are a few choices to look at: Escort, Breuer, and Heroic\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/escort/\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/breuer-condensed/light-italic/\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed/book-oblique/\r\n"

  body: "Yes, I realize I misphrased my initial post in that I'm not looking for the
    font \"speed graphic,\" but rather the font that would be used for logo design.
    Thanks Chris. \r\n\r\nI've found that Heroic Condensed Oblique (http://typetrust.com/font/heroiccondensed)
    and Filmotype Escort (http://new.myfonts.com/search/filmotype+escort/fonts/) have
    similar qualities, but lack the nuance of this face. Will compare with Univers
    as well..."

    looking at as well from Type Trust. 3/3 then. At least I'm swimming in the right
    pool.\r\n"

  body: Wearetrippen Tall has an R that gets a little closer too, but doesn't come
    in oblique. Trump Gothic is also close.

  body: I doubt if you will find anything closer than you have.  If you MUST have
    that R, you might contact the foundry (TypeTrust or whoever) of the font you choose
    and ask them to change the R for you?  There will be a fee, but you will get what
    you want.

    or Heroic look much closer to the sample? The R is what he really wants most\r\n\r\nThe
    Fontry image you linked to is pretty low rez though."
