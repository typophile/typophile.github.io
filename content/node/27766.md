  body: "Please explain what you mean by \"support for superscript and subscript\"?
    Very few fonts have sups or subs beyond the handful of common Unicode encoded
    ones you find in western codepages. \r\n\r\nIn most cases applications will scale
    and position the normal characters in the font to form the sups and subs. Some
    apps use values in the font as a guide, others use an algorithm. \r\n\r\nOf course
    OpenType supports the sub and sup features so an OpenType font could include specifically
    drawn glyphs for every normal glyph, but I don\u2019t think any cover more than
    a handful.\r\n\r\nSo finding a font manager or viewer to sort through this \u2013
    showing true, scaled and OpenType sups and subs seems a bit, er specialized. You
    might be better off using an app like InDesign and some scripts to generate samples
    of all the fonts you have with the sups and subs you care about.  \r\n"

    body: "Hi\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer, I think the idea of using scripts
      sounds good, since it's propably impossible to find a viewer that has just the
      specific feature I'm looking for.\r\nEven if I found a viewer that would let
      me see a sample text in either super or subscript, it wouldn't be possible to
      mix the two on the same line. See example pic.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your
      time.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuperSub_Example_4821.gif]"
