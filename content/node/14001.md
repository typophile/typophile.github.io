body: Does this font exist from any foundry? I'm a production manager at an agency
  where naughty young designers have specified Frutiger condensed as part of a corporate
  identity, and now we're fudging when we need Frutiger condensed italic. Is there
  another font that would pass for Frutiger cond ital?

    Frutiger. - Frutiger itself dont loved the idea of a true italic, but the market
    demanded, so Linotype made it. Have a look to Linotypes Frutiger Next. They used
    the italic model of Myriad for their version, but not for the condensed ones.\r\n\r\n--<a
