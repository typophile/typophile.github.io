body: In a months time I&#39;ll travel from Dover to Lands End &#40;in the UK&#41;
  taking photos, picking up stuff from the ground and talking to people. Do you know
  of good &#40;type-&#41;spots along that route? &#40;diners, streets, museums, anything&#41;
  Please let me know. If you live along that route we could also go for a beer. <BR>this&#39;ll
  be a grand road movie. Without the movie. <BR>
