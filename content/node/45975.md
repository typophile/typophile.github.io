  design work. I created the letterforms in Illustrator - I'm sure something similar
  (if not identical) exists somewhere out there, but I was unable to find it. Please
  share your thoughts. Thank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qube_cr_6665.jpg]"

  body: "JH, \r\nYou're right! Some of the letters are identical. My concept was to
    fit every letter in a square of the same size (with a couple of exceptions - like
    r, t, and i) - i didn't go monospace for all letters. "
