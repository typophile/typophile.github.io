  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,
Long time lurker, I finally have a request to post here: I would very much appreciate a critique of a business card I’m designing for a violin maker.
The typography is loosely inspired by the stamps used to make violin labels in late 17th, early 18th century Italy. Janson, Kis and the like didn't feel quite right so I treated myself to Lexicon, so far this is the only irrevocable decision.

<img src="http://typophile.com/files/A_7.jpg">
<img src="http://typophile.com/files/B_16.jpg">

The frontside of the business cards would be letterpress’d from polymere plates (the tryouts I made look fairly good). Everything inked except the f-hole which would only be embossed. The backside printed with varnish on a paper similar to Royal Print containing wood so it gets colored by daylight rather quickly.

<img src="http://typophile.com/files/card1_0.jpg">

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kentlew's suggestion of die cutting the f-hole is a nice idea. (I might make it bigger than you have it, though.) 

But if you emboss it, you may want to print the f-hole in a very faint tint (like a tinted varnish) before embossing. A small embossing like that can just disappear under some lighting conditions.

Is "Luthier" in a smaller point size? It looks smaller to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the suggestions. A die cut for the f-hole would unfortunately be too pricey at this stage but adding a faint tint to the emboss sounds very good.
The word “Luthier” is set in the same point size (and as I remember x-height) as the rest, this seems to be the italic's design, but maybe in this case I could adjust it?

I was mostly afraid the composition looked dull and not very tight somehow.</div>

beastpieces.com (a letterpress printer) sometimes posts examples that use that technique. This example is debossing, which would probably be more appropriate than embossing.

		<div class="commentbody">Neil,
Point taken. The violin maker insists on the f-hole and wood image because he says it's unclear to some what "luthier" means. I'd rather make something that only relies on the ageing of varnish (some abstract riddle-ish pattern) and let the typography be the only token but it's difficult to convince him that this could be clear enough.

Johan,
I agree, the one the violin maker sent me is from an Amati cello, it looks great at display size but if using one I should look for a text cut, from a 1/2 violin or something.

		<div class="commentbody">Or: have a black background and make <em>only the f-hole</em> a wood texture!

BTW, that particular f-hole design has an interesting abrupt angle at the ends of the inside curves (I'm guessing to reduce the risk of breakage). More suitable than Lexicon might be a font that exhibits that characteristic. Maybe something by Menhart, or Dwiggins.

If an f-hole glyph needs to be made, the integral sign is a great place to start (assuming it's not merely a generic math dump-in, like many type designers do). And the Florin might be an alternative, depending.

Oh, and anybody who doesn't know what luthier means is quite unlikely to need one anyway.

- It strikes me that that wood grain looks like curtains... as in: musical performance. Don't know what you could do with that though - maybe some kind of red velvet tint, or transition?

- Those long phone number strings look uncomfortable, messy; I think their "wordspace" is too loose compared to the letterspace. Try tightening each pair of numbers. And the parentheses are too high.

- Thank you for the suggestion. Thing is, I started from the US/UK expression which I found nicely fitting and tried to find a french equivalent. My favourite is "prendre de la bouteille" but it might not be the most fitting, and not too appropriate for a business card.
- I agree, this is a quick photoshop tryout but it doesn't bring the right association. I will keep trying out for this one. Watercolor maybe..
- I tried tightening "wordspace" between the pairs of numbers, it does look a lot better, could it be still closer together?

		<div class="commentbody">Nice concept and layout. Here's my two cents:

- The last two bottom lines with phone numbers and contact info should be set in a smaller size, say 2 points less than the luthier's name line of text.
- I would increase a little, in general, the word spacing (around +10%)
- by my point of view, the motto ("bonifie avec l'age") should stand on its own, either on top or on the recto of the card.

If you find a printer able to letterpress it - using a cliché - , it will look very nice.</div>

 The  italic is tighter - More condensed which seems to make it look a little smaller. Perhaps some more space would off-set that a bit.

Awesome. For me, a Canadian, the more ways the are to spell words the bettre.

Figural would be lovely but I swore myself to stop using Menhart's types unless I had to set something in Czech!

James & Hrant,
Thank you for the suggestions but in this case I would like to focus on making a piece of nice paper with letters pressed on one size and varnish on the other. I think Neil Caldwell's "trivial tokens" comment was right on point, every graphic translation of a violin's top plate into printed matter will somehow look ridiculous next to an instrument, where the cards will be exchanged most of the time.

I tried something without the f-hole, clearer lines of text and a less literal translation of the wood's texture but it could maybe still be simpler.</div>
