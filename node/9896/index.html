  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been asked to try to get some quick information for a product and not spend any money (yet) doing so&hellip; <BR> <BR>Generically speaking, what I'm trying to determine is what rings we'll need to hop through to produce a three-dimensional product using a font.  The kicker, is that we'll need to use the name of the font (ie Trade Gothic).  So, I'm guessing that we'll need to obtain a special licensing deal for use of font&hellip;because of the identification. <BR> <BR>Or, not?  With the license of our existing fonts are we already covered?  We've bought many fonts in the past (but who saves the TOS) so&hellip;this is where I'm fuzzy. <BR> <BR>Anyways, before we have to get attorneys involved and such I'm hoping that somebody might have some insight even with my lack of very clear product information (just try to take it as I explained it). <BR> <BR>Thanks, v</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My take on licenses is that I only buy fonts which licenses aren't stuck in the 1980's. But on the other hand I'm using those for my own stuff sometimes. I'm not sure if this helps or not. <BR> <BR>If the font is used in a game for a gaming console you don't need to fear that someone cracks the code and pulls out the font for desktop use. Even on a Mac or Windows game the fonts are usually put in hard to convert formats that render the font unusable for desktop use. <BR> <BR>In a font license the part of the font embedding would affect you I think. That quite fits what you do, embed the whole font in a product that uses it, but the font can't be pulled out of it again. <BR> <BR>It's hard to guess, as a lot of foundries are still fast asleep when it comes to solutions for modern media. <BR> <BR>FJ</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you could consider it embedding if a rather common technique is used where a font file is <i>embedded</i> into the application. The 3D engine then either renders it in 2D as a texture or creates geometry from its outlines in (semi)real-time. <BR> <BR>I agree with Si that a custom license would be the safest way in any case. Not necessarily the more costly even.  <BR> <BR>FJ</div>

		<div class="commentbody">v, it might be helpful if you could clarify what you mean by &quot;three-dimensional product.&quot;  <BR> <BR>When I first read it, I assumed you meant something like letters cast in metal. In other words, physical objects, like House Industries' Neutraface house numbers.  <BR> <BR>When Frank started talking about 3d digital rendering in some sort of software product, I realized that that could well be what you mean.  <BR> <BR>Either interpretation seems possible from your description, but they are entirely different things when it comes to licensing issues.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">V. Depending upon the font which you are using to create your 3D object, I would recommend you contact the foundry. Some foundries won't mind and will not see what you have done as against their EULA, but some foundries will see it exactly opposite. Those foundries will view what you've created as dependent upon their typeface and will require additional licensing fees. I would guess that these foundries will be more likely to be generous if you contact them now, before you've created the product.  <BR> <BR>My suggestions</div>
