  I am supplying him with Flash templates which I create on a Mac. \r\n\r\nI have
  supplied him with PC versions of the exact font I am using (even though he owns
  the font himself, I have made a version for PC using Fontographer, to try and ensure
  equivalence), but whenever he resupplies me with the completed file, the fonts all
  look completely different and have shifted position.\r\n\r\nThis isn't the end of
  the world, it just involves a lot more work for me than I was originally expecting.
  However, we are about to begin work on a new Flash movie that requires a 'handwritten'
  style typeface.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a handwritten font that will work and
  look exactly the same on both platforms, without me having to reposition it every
  time?\r\n\r\nMany thanks..."

  body: "Flash may be a problem. As far as I know, Flash does not support OpenType
    fonts. With an OpenType font, you could use the same font file on a Mac and a
    PC. That would normally eliminate your issues.\r\n\r\nI can't guarantee you that
    any same PC and Mac versions of a font will render exactly alike. But maybe I'm
    wrong."

    Type. I'll post in a few of the Flash Forums to see if anyone can tell me more.
    If I get any joy, I'll post back here in case anyone else ever has a similar problem.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the reply."

  body: "Actually it is possible that Flash offers the same basic support for OT fonts
    as Freehand MX. That is super limited, but here is its level of support (from
    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/9-9-9-14510/opentypeandapplicationsupport.html\">this
    page</a> on the Linotype website).\r\n\r\n<strong>Freehand MX (Windows XP/Mac
    OS X)</strong>\r\n1. Only TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts (\u201CTTF\u201D) are
    supported. These function like traditional TrueType fonts\r\n\r\n2. No support
    for \u201CCFF\u201D-flavored OpenType fonts\r\n\r\n3. Only the first 255 characters
    of Latin Character Sets are supported\r\n\r\n4. No Unicode support, and therefore
    no capabilities beyond Latin 1 languages\r\n\r\n5. No support for OpenType Layout
    features"

    body: "Excellent. In this case, that limited support will probably be good enough.
      All I need to do now is post in the design forum to see if anyone can recommend
      a handwritten-style TrueType OpenType font...\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help."

    has <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/languages/unicode_in_flmx/\">supported
    Unicode</a> since player 6.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure flash supports both flavours
    of opentype font, but does not support opentype features (flash throws away a
    lot of font info when it embeds the font)."
