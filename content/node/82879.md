body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nIdea: Logo in the making in Illustrator, The top one is kerned
  by 'Auto', the bottom one is kerned by using 'pair of 3 letters kerning principle'
  (By lying white strokes above the rest of the type). Pouring water between the characters
  principle isn't always usable I think, squinting and looking at a whole is in my
  opinion more usable.\r\n\r\nFeel free to post a comment on the kerning or design.\r\n\r\nhttp://jeroenboselie.blogspot.com/2011/06/museum-logo.html\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, Jeroen"

  body: "I'd put /MUSEUM/ to align with /T/ instead of apostrophe.\r\n\r\nBut both
    have a uniform letterspacing. The first one has more loose spaced /MUSEUM/ which
    by my opinion fits /'T OUDE SLOT/ much better because it's smaller type and being
    more loose has similar contrast."

    90 pt Auto, in Illustrator) \r\nThe logo also could have been made in Indesign.\r\n\r\nGr

    museum in dat logo aanpakken."

  body: "Thanks for the advice,\r\n\r\nIn the end it's just what the client wants,
    making the type as fat as the present logo is an option though.\r\n\r\nI've chosen
    to keep it a little lighter in appearance.\r\n\r\nCurrent logo seems a little
    scaled horizontally.\r\n\r\nGr Jeroen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo1_4623.jpg]"
