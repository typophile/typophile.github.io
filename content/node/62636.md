  body: "I checked the Script Guide and Dafont for anything like these and found nothing
    that matched. The top one is probably hand-drawn, and in any case it is probably
    not the same font as the \"HOW TO WEAR IT\" lettering, if it is a font. The latter
    is surely a font, but may be a custom-made one, since that style can be made by
    anyone very cheaply, and with no skill.\r\n\r\nI am not sure I understand searching
    for exact matches for fonts like this, because there are hundreds of free fonts
    that would have the same feeling, if not the identical details.\r\n\r\n- Mike
