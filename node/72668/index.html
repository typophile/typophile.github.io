  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Adam,

We got a notice that the large discount to purchase the Fontographer upgrade would expire in a few days, at the end of the month. Now, the only thing I would use Fontographer over FontLab for is it's *change weight* feature (as opposed to FL's *bold*). If I do only that in Fontographer, I'll (1) spend an extra $100, and (2) have a cumbersome workflow. 

It is rumored that when FL Studio 6 comes out, the "bold" will work much better, akin to Fontographer's "change weight." Does anyone at FontLab have a projection when version 6 will come out? 

(Jeez, from your web page, you are partly the marketing manager. Usually I don't ask a marketing manager if I can save some money by not buying one of their products, but in FontLab's case, I figure you guys have our interests at heart.)

Our intent is to have FontLab Studio 6 for Windows available by the end of this calendar year, and the Mac version 3-4 months later. 

These are early projections but we're on a steady development track right now.

		<div class="commentbody">Dunwich Type: No, we've provided some funding for RoboFab development, but not for Glyphs. 

Charles: It's not like that. Georg approached us quite some time ago, giving us suggestions for further development of our product. He started developing Glyphs as a proof of concept that his ideas had merit. We've been in informal contact for a few years, and a few months ago (at the ATypI Dublin conference, in fact), we've come to a mutual agreement that it's best for both sides if Georg is working for us, and helps us improve the products. By the way, the story is quite similar to how I came to work for FontLab. I've corresponded with the developers for a few years and shared my ideas with them, and at some point they decided to invite me to their team. There is certainly no conspiracy behind all this :) 

The past few months of development also showed us that we need to rewrite some major parts of our 13-years-old code from scratch. Some limitations of it (such as the integer coordinates, limitation to +-32,000 in coordinate space, hardwired Multiple Master support) limited us largely as for what we could do. But the biggest problem was indeed, the rooting of the Mac version in Mac OS 9, Carbon, and PowerPC. Moving the old code to XCode and Intel turned out to be a huge task and lots of wasted energy. So we concentrated on rewriting the core from scratch, eliminating lots of silly stuff from the past, improving the speed and stability a lot. A huge part of it is already done, but we were not able to finalize the application by the end of the last calendar year. 

I realize that it's disappointing for many of our customers, but please be assured that we *are* working at our full capacity on the project. It's just a hugely complex application and we do have very limited resources (in short: we're a small company). 

I'll keep you posted on new developments, of course. 

Best regards,
Adam

&nbsp;
If you <strong>really</strong> can’t wait for applying the AFDKO 2.5, you could generate your OT fonts without features using FLS, build a features file that contains all you can think of, like <a href="http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/features_2.1_New_OTM.txt">this one</a> (I will revise and enhance the file shortly), and use <em>DTL OTMaster</em>, which is available from FontLab Ltd, to generate (and check and [if applicable] edit) the tables.
&nbsp;
Adam: <em>[...] we need to rewrite some major parts of our 13-years-old code from scratch</em>
&nbsp;
After releasing DTL FontMaster in 2002 we were in a pickle, because the MFC compiler was not updated to support Mac OS X. So, everything had to be newly coded at URW++ in <em>Qt</em> (if I recall correctly what Yuri told me in Dublin, FL Ltd has switched to Qt too).
All our recent applications, from OTM to LeMo have been made using Qt, and sooner or later we will have a new font editor also.
&nbsp;
(At the moment I am thinking of an iOS version of [the new edition of] LeMo [which will be for free again, of course].)

		<div class="commentbody">Dear all,

About a year ago, I wrote: "the biggest problem was indeed, the rooting of the Mac version in Mac OS 9, Carbon, and PowerPC. Moving the old code to XCode and Intel turned out to be a huge task and lots of wasted energy. So we concentrated on rewriting the core from scratch, eliminating lots of silly stuff from the past, improving the speed and stability a lot." 

As you can see now -- primarily because of Apple's decision to drop PPC support from Mac OS X 10.7 Lion -- we had to change things once again. 

As it was obvious that the complete rewrite would not be ready before Lion is released, we decided to do what we had dreaded to do for so long. In the last 15 months or so, we did indeed port the Metroworks/PowerPC-based Mac code to XCode/Intel-based Mac code and upgraded all text controls to Unicode (so typing Cyrillic or Greek characters is possible directly in the Preview panel or the Metrics Window's text box), upgraded the Python integration. Especially the first step was a truly major operation -- about 24 man-months of full-time work! 

As I said, the lack of compatibility and support of the older development platforms on the Apple side was the primary reason why the FontLab Studio for Mac development was on hold in 2007-2010. 

Moving from PPC to Intel in our case was really a great challenge, but fortunately, it's done now. And -- hell! -- we decided to swallow the cost of those 24 man-months ourselves and released FLS 5.1 as a free update for all 5.0 users. While FLS 5.1.1 is not yet perfect, it's MUCH more than just a simple update to 5.0.4. Really a lot was changed to make FLS 5.1.1 run 2.5 times faster than 5.0.4. But most of those changes were done "under the hood". 

Anyhow -- the work of the last 15 months has laid a good foundation for FontLab Studio 6 development on the Mac. And after all, in FLS 5.1.1, we have also included some features that were originally planned for FontLab Studio 6: we have integrated Adobe FDK for OpenType version 2.5 and the native Microsoft rasterizers for TrueType hinting preview, included the Clean Up Paths algorithm from Fontographer (in FLS 5.1's Actions panel) as an alternative to Optimize, and done some additional improvements under the hood. 

We realize that for some users it's not much, but that's primarily because we never really planned to release FLS 5.1. All this work was supposed to go into FLS 6.0, along with "real new features" but because of Lion, we needed to shift things around, give all priority to the necessary architectural changes first (so that 5.1 could be released), and do the nice creative things later. 

There are more features that we're working on, and also more bugfixes. Some are already "ready" i.e. implemented in a development build for Windows, and currently we are merging the changes that two teams had done independently (the Windows team and the Mac team). Others have been developed while we worked on Fontographer 5.0 and 5.1 (a huge lot, actually), and we're now able to "move" them into FontLab Studio. We are also prioritizing the features that still need to be developed, and working on their implementation. 

I'd like to add that for years, FontLab and later FontLab Studio were developed by just two people (one on Mac, one on Windows). We now have a team of seven people working on FontLab Studio 6, and they're making good progress. 

We also have a separate team working on a complete rewrite of the code, but that project -- while it's hugely exciting and, dare I say, quite revolutionary -- will still take time to gain shape.  

Overall, I can say that in the last 12 months, I've seen the most intense development progress at Fontlab Ltd. since I joined the company in 2004. 

So basically, the bottom line is: FontLab Studio 6 will be built on the mature, solid foundation of the current FLS 5.1 codebase. It won't be a revolution, but will be an evolution. It's being worked on as we speak. It will suffer from some limitations of the FLS 5.x codebase (e.g. integer coordinates only), and will not include a huge number of revolutionary changes, but our goal is: some good new features and a lot of stability improvements. I still cannot give you any specific times at this point simply because -- as I said -- we're currently doing the major improvement in the code, and it's difficult to estimate when we'll have something which will be ready-to-ship. But we'll start seeding pre-release versions to groups of testers within the next few months. 

At the same time, we're working on a product that will be a completely new thing. From what I've seen: if FontLab Studio 5 was PageMaker 6, then FontLab Studio 6 will be PageMaker 7, and "the completely new thing" will be InDesign. 

You'll be hearing from us. Before the end of the world, I'm sure of it! 

Happy 2012 for you all! 

Best,
Adam

I think from reading this thread, you should realize that whenever I announce any timeframes, people end up laughing at me some time later. 

I could give you my *goal* though: my goal is to have FontLab Studio 6 released in 2012 for both Mac OS X and Windows. I really cannot be more specific. But early development pre-release versions should be available within the next 2-3 months or so. We'll post an announcement inviting people to a closed pre-release program as soon as those are available. 

We're back to work on our "flagship product". Not on Photofont, not on BitFonter, not on Fontographer etc., but on FontLab Studio. 

Best,
Adam

Good to hear the FontLab team is taking this as seriously as you obviously do. For now, FontLab 5.0.4 is still working fine on my Windows 7 system, but boy! am I looking forward to a major update. Using FL5 now does indeed feel a bit like how using PageMaker while waiting for InDesign must have felt (while knowing that QuarkXPress is available). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Charles, 

InDesign has gone a long way now, but the point is the comparison between PageMaker and InDesign. InDesign did bring native PDF support, full vector-based drawing, Unicode, OpenType, plug-in extensibility and an overall "modern" approach to page layout. PageMaker was an old product, based on a very old core. 

I'm not trying to compare the future FontLab product to InDesign directly :) I'm trying to make the parallel that the difference between FontLab Studio as you know it now (and which version *6* will still be based on) and the future product (let's call it FLS 7 for now) will be just as serious as the difference between PageMaker and InDesign (which both came from the former Aldus and later Adobe development). 

Just as Aldus and later Adobe kept on developing PageMaker while having started a completely new product (InDesign) from scratch, we are working on a similar cycle. We're adding features, maturity and stability to FLS 5.x to make FLS 6. It won't be a revolution but will be an evolution -- of a product which is now (in total) some 15 years old. 

At the same time, we're reinventing the font editor completely, from scratch, based on a very modern and flexible architecture. 

The bottom line is: we're working hard, and we're fortunate to have the largest team of developers that we've ever had, and they're some some very fine people! :) I'm excited. 

Best,
Adam

Unlike any other company that offers font editing tools, we've always developed for both Mac OS X and Windows. This is on one hand a bit of complication (since the development takes longer and the applications may not look and feel so completely slick and fancy as some competing products), on the other hand it allows more users to run the tools. 

Macs are somewhat popular in Western Europe and the U.S., but in the rest of the world, they're hardly relevant. We want to make products that allow people to make fonts not just for the Western languages, but also for all the other scripts that exist in the world. 

So we have, and will continue to release products for both Mac OS X and Windows. 

Best,
Adam

Ah. Perhaps that's why my business partner, ethnic Chinese, born & raised in Sabah, educated in Scotland and the U.S., dislikes Macs...

For me, the old Altsys Fontographer, even though developed for the Mac, use to crash on the hour when used on a Mac. It was sort of intuitive. Every time you think "I'd better save now," the program would beat you to it and crash. 

But it seemed bulletproof on a P.C. And TeX ran better on a P.C. ...</div>

FontLab Studio 6 for Mac OS X and for Windows will be a 32-bit Intel application. Just as the current versions of FontLab Studio (5.1 on Mac OS X and 5.0.4 on Windows), FLS6 will work fine on 64-bit operating systems. 

As far as I can tell, the primary advantage of compiling applications as native 64-bit Intel is the ability to address more than 4 GB of RAM. Are there other reasons why you'd need a native 64-bit version? </div>

font development isn't particularly RAM-hungry. The 4 GB limit is far more than enough. Native 64-bit is mostly needed for large images or video editing where you're really dealing with huge amounts of data. Yet developing a native 64-bit version is costly, because you can't just switch to it -- you still need a 32-bit version of code. We're already making a Mac and a Windows version, and adding the 32+64 bit pair to each those would mean double the binaries. Then, there's the PPC + Intel on the Mac etc. When developing applications, they need to be tested in a variety of environments. We already have several versions of Windows and Mac OS X on which we need to test. 

Let's say we release the Windows version of the app only as 32-bit native. Then we need to test that code on Windows 7 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit. 

But if we release the Windows version of the app as both 32-bit and 64-bit, we'd need to test the 32-bit code on Windows 7 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit, and the 64-bit code on Windows 7 64-bit. And then also comes Windows XP and Vista, and the Mac OS X versions etc. 

So it'd just add more combinations that would need to be thoroughly tested, which would only delay the release of the products even further. So we think it's not worth the effort. 

I hope you understand the above reasoning. 

Best,
Adam

> If you are already working on FL7, why waste your time and energy on FL6?

As I explained it earlier, it's kind of similar of Aldus and later Adobe working concurrently on PageMaker and InDesign. 

Developing an application from scratch takes a long time. FontLab Studio as we know it today is a very feature-rich application with an established user interface and usage patters by the users. Many people are used to it, they're very proficient in the tool but have been asking for more than just UFO. In our minds, we quite well know what FontLab Studio 6 will be like, and we're essentially implementing what already has been planned. We'll "call it a day" once we've given our devoted users *what they want*. 

What I'm referring to as "FontLab Studio 7" is a different matter. It may well break with many of the old habits and make users introduce new ones. We're working on it, but it's nowhere near completion. Some parts of its functionality haven't been even started, while others are already quite well-implemented. It's certain, however, that users will need to re-learn. Some people may perhaps hate it in the end. It's very likely that the product won't be called "FontLab Studio 7" at all (again, as with PageMaker, where InDesign 1.0 and PageMaker 6.5 and later InDesign 2.0 and PageMaker 7.0 were different products). 

It will take quite some time for the new product to cover all kinds of functionalities that people will need. For some years to come, FontLab Studio (5.x now and 6.0 later this year) will be the *only* product on the market which will offer that particular functionality. In other words, FontLab Studio as we know it now is now a mature product, like a person in their 40s. The fully new product is in its early teen years. At some point, it'll be in its early 20s but will still not be free of faults. There will be people who'll jump onto the new kid on the block but there will be others who'll prefer to stick with the old product. 

You can also see it this way: FontLab Studio as we know it now is so extensive that -- when it comes to the "wealth" of features -- it practically has no match on the market. But there is Glyphs and RoboFont, which are more sophisticated and smoother as a design tool, while on the other hand they don't offer (and probably never will) offer certain other aspects -- like for example manual TrueType hinting. 

The new product will initially be more in the same realm as Glyphs or RoboFab, I suppose. Only with time, it (or perhaps a separate tool) may also cover other parts which are currently unique to FLS. 

With UFO, fortunately, we can have interoperability between all these products. 

With any product, there is a certain development cycle. You have it with fonts as well: 

Imagine FontLab Studio 6 as a typeface which already had earlier versions released, but you're now adding Greek and some OpenType glyphs. It already has 90% of the intended character set, which is kerned and hinted, but now you're working on some additional glyphs, reviewing existing spacing, kerning and hinting, fixing some problems with them, and writing some additional code for OpenType Layout features. 

Then imagine our new product (which I referred to as "FLS7" but this may very well change) as a typeface where you have most of the basic alphabet and quite a few special glyphs already drawn, but you still are deciding on the shape of the serifs, and maybe you'll redraw some of the glyphs completely, and perhaps you'll re-space it fully once again, and there are no composite glyphs or math glyphs or any kerning or hinting done yet. 

You certainly wouldn't say "just drop the first one completely and focus all your energy on the second one", would you?

Adam</div>

is there any possibility to have a 5.1 version for Windows addressing the 6,000 glyph limit? FLS runs very smoothly for me (in a Vista 64-bit, using the XP compatibility mode) but the glyph limit does not let me to work with the whole font project.

Although FLS hardly consumes many resources, I found a situation where it becomes almost frozen. When working with _xxx anchors which are referred by hundreds of base letter with xxx anchors, the program takes several seconds to do any operation – even to open the glyph window.

With the help of fellow typophiller Eigi, I did a workaround to edit combining diacritics: changed the _xxx anchors to _zzz with a Python script. To build compositions, just change the anchors back to _xxx. Anyway, this is a rare issue where FLS really stresses the computer resources (but just with glyphs where there is a _xxx anchor, all remaining operations keep normal).</div>

Yes, I understand everything what you're saying and it's not so easy as it seems, as you already explained. It's like when webdesigner make tests on every browser, going down to IE6, cause market dictates some rules.

My question was mostly related to those who will/would, in some moment, have to use Windows (Vista/7) 64-bit as their environment. For example, on this computer, I have 8GB (Vista 64-bit) and on another 16GB with Win7 64-bit. Cause I think people will start moving to 64-bit OS slowly since trends on IT market are moving forward to it, like it or not, and in some moment, most of designers (graphic/web/typo..) would have to switch to 64-bit cause of RAM on first place. Simply said - when you're buying a new configuration those days (for general design usage), somehow 4GB became standard RAM in offer.

I'm just afraid, it might happened, for example, that in some moment, after 1-2 years of releasing FLS6 doesn't become an "problematic" software for OS and reverse. So it doesn't become already old version cause of IT trends we're talking about.</div>

Then that's good to hear. Didn't had a chance to try it in any Windows 64 bit OS yet.

There was no problem at all, I just thought that FLS6 could have some issues with 64 bit OS and wanted to ask Adam if they were thinking about it in advance. That's all. Cause (theoretically) if something is not made to be used in another environment, then there might be a chance that something goes wrong. But it's cool to know that FLS 5.x works fine.</div>

Most applications made for Windows are 32-bit. Also many Mac OS X applications are 32-bit (although the OS is natively 64 bit since 10.6). For example, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Skype, Adobe InDesign CS5, Adobe Illustrator CS5 and many many others. They all work fine on a 64-bit system. As far as I could tell, FontLab Studio 5.1 (Mac) and 5.0.4 (Win) work well there as well. 

The only slight complication is when you heavily use Python and C-compiled modules. Some C-compiled modules made for Python may be 64-bit only (though it's still a rarity). Or at the very least you need to be aware of that -- so for example, on Windows 7 64-bit, you need to install the 32-bit version of Python 2.4 rather than the 64-bit version.

Adam</div>

theoretically, OpenType PS (.otf) supports fractional coordinates, but there are some technical caveats associated with it. In principle, we could say that the final font formats only support integer coordinates but during the work process, having fractional coordinates would be helpful. 

For example, if you have drawn your glyphs on an integer grid, but then you'd like to make some adjustments such as: make it slightly more narrow, then slightly wider, then perhaps slant it by a few degrees and then slant it back, or make some tiny rotations, or maybe scale the glyph down and then up again -- on an integer grid, the result will have accumulated the rounding errors from every one of these operations. On a fractional grid, all your shapes (the positions of the BCPs, the angles, the stem thicknesses etc.) will always remain just as in the original design. 

Therefore, a hardwired integer grid such as the one in FontLab Studio does impose a certain limitation onto the type designer. A fractional grid such as the one in Fontographer allows you to avoid those rounding errors. But of course, at the very end, when you decide to generate or ship the font, you'll need to align your points to an integer grid, or the software will do this for you. 

Hopefully that helps to answer your question! 

Best,
Adam

		<div class="commentbody">Every time I see Adam, which is usually at least once a year, I ask for a progress report. The good news is that there is always progress, and some of it is very cool. The bad news, from my perspective, is that updating to FontLab 6 might require as much of a re-investment in Python scripting as switching to RoboFont or Glyphs.

This is mostly guesswork, but I think FontLab are a little wrong-footed by the recent advent of competition in the primary glyph tool category from RoboFont and Glyphs, just as they were previously wrong-footed by the initial poor implementation of the Mac version of FontLab Studio, which contributed to the development of that competition. It took a lot of effort from what I understand to be a reduced team to remake a stable version of FLS for Mac, and that is part of the reason why 'Victoria' -- the new code architecture for FontLab 6 -- has been delayed. Remember, FontLab has always been primarily a Windows tool and only secondarily ported to Mac. I was reflecting recently that it was about 20 years ago that I saw an ad in a desktop publishing magazine and bought my first license for FontLab 2.5. It was good, and successive (Windows) versions of FontLab have remained good. Current trends favour more openly scriptable object structures, which is a good thing, but it terms of core functionality FLS remains better than any other tool I have tried, and even with its current scripting model fits nicely into my sfnt-centric workflow. I also remain impressed by the size and performance of the VFB source format, even for large fonts of the kinds I regularly build, compared to UFO, which contains less information in much larger files and takes ages to load even in dedicated UFO tools. While I can understand why people are keen for a version of FontLab that natively handles UFO files, I'd like to see the VFB format open-sourced and supported in UFO tools.</div>

A kind of Hobbit. But if you call them that, they shout, "We're Little Wrong-Feets!"

Current trends favour more openly scriptable object structures, but only if extendable. Is that VFB or sfnt?

Time management concerned with figurative "ages to load", while waiting literally "years to do", seem reasonable?

		<div class="commentbody">I do not notice any difference in loading time between UFO and VFB files on my 3 year old Mac.

The only time I notice quickly is when there is a software or bug issue that prevents me from working well and efficiently.  Whatever FontLab does to make Victoria dance needs to be rock solid above all.  I much prefer rock solid to glitzy and cute features.  The main feature that needs attention is search and replace.

I have licensed and support the further development of the 3 major players, FontLab, Robofont, and Glyphs and hope they all prosper and have a lovely synergistic competition among themselves. Competition is vital.  We can never trust putting all of our eggs in one basket again.  I have seen this in Quark, Adobe, FontLab, Apple, and Microsoft.  When a product becomes the default standard, developers get complacent and the user gets screwed.  May healthy competition thrive and keep all parties active and honest.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We’ve been releasing the things first which were ready first. 

TransType 4 was primarily made so that we could test the fully rewritten and modernized import/export infrastructure (OTF, TTF, EOT, WOFF, SVG, VFB, UFO and all the other formats, including conversions between them). We basically wanted the “gear” done and stable — before releasing a follow-up to FontLab Studio. We figured, it’s more important to have a tool with limited functionality which generates good fonts than to have a tool with full functionality that generates bad fonts. 

FontLab Pad was done because it was very easy — it’s essentially the Preview panel of TransType. In the same vein, we wanted to have a tool for ourselves — a testing app for the color fonts in all the relevant formats (sbix, COLR, SVG). 

We’re heavily under way on glyph editing right now. The lack of my activity here on Typophile and other forums actually indicates that we’re working hard. 

We’ll start publishing pre-release versions of our new font editor in the next months. 

You’ll love it, and you’ll be blown away :)

Microsoft Font Validator has not been updated in a long time. The OS/2 table version 4 and the gasp table version 1 have been added to the OpenType standard after the release of Font Validator, so the complaints related to OS/2 and gasp are all a false alarm. The tables are correct. 

As for the "W0020—Tables are not in optimal order: table 'glyf' precedes table 'loca'" warning, it's by no means critical but we'll look into it. 

Thanks,
Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, with regard to the table order warning, this is a test that Microsoft put into Font Validator based on performance testing that they did in the 1990s. If the tables are in a particular order, Windows can do some things faster. If you're concerned about this, you can run the FastFont command line tool from MS on your fonts, which will put the tables in the 'optimal' order.

Adam, I don't know if the preferred table order is published anywhere, but you presumably run FastFont on a font and then look what the resulting table order is. If your new tools would write that order by default, it would save us a post-productions step.</div>

I routinely use FastFont to order the tables correctly, and it's a breeze: simply drop the font filename onto fastfont.exe, and it does the job in the blink of an eye. During my latest rounds of updating, I had to do this over 600 times, which became a bit tedious. I pointed out the anomaly in order to to save others the effort, because it seems to me that the fix should be easy.</div>

TBH, I never used FastFont, but just had a look at it. Actually you can make a shell script for FastFont (using a listing of all your .ttf ﬁles). This is a bit less tedious ;-)

		<div class="commentbody">I'm looking forward to the new FL release. Working on my latest typeface I have a set of swashes. I have been laboriously copying from 'results' in the Open Type Features Preview panel, then pasting into the Metrics panel to do the class kerning. It would be great if any features results could be incorporated into the main metrics panel for ease of editing. That would be a huge improvement.</div>
