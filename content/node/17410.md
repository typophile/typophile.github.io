  what I've got right now. Anybody got suggestions for improvement?\r\n\r\n(and yes,
  \"Heagy\" is a last name and it's terrible. Pronounced \"HAY-gee\" where the g is
  hard like in \"goodness gracious that name sounds like you're spitting!\")"

  body: "I think the first version was about right for the HEA combination, especially
    at the small size, while the AG wants a slight increase and the GY wants an even
    smaller increase, these alterations are only hair's* difference.\r\nIn the second
    version I would consider closing up the HE slightly it is creating a quite distinct
    vertical.\r\nTim\r\n* or gnat's"
