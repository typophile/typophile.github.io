  out pretty much so thought if anyone can recognize this one?\r\nWill upload a better
  image tonight when I have my camera.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/devoksnesby_5300.gif]"

  body: "Here is a link to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/waters-titling-mm/|Waters
    Titling]]. The heavier condensed versions seem similar, but the Y (at least) seems
    wrong, unless there are alternates in the font. \r\n\r\nI don't think Utopia matches
    because there is no serif on the middle arm of the E in this sample.\r\n\r\n-
