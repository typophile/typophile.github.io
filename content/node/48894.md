  font</a> working in Word 2004 on the Mac. Right now the tops of the diacritical
  marks are getting hacked off. I\u2019ve been trying various possible settings of
  the vertical metrics and had no luck. And of course it works fine in Indesign and
  Textedit\u2026 \r\n\r\nThe highest point in the font is 978, the lowest is -300,
  stuff appears to be getting chopped off at around 945. WinAscent is at 1089 and
  WinDescent at -411, which seems like plenty of padding. How do I get this working?\r\n\r\nAnd
  before anyone asks, yes, I\u2019ve read the relevant HowTo and the FLAB manual.\r\n\r\nEdit:
  Fixed the link problem so it doesn\u2019t go to an old post about Hebrew fonts."

  body: You can't. Because it is a rtl text which is not supported in Word for Mac.
    I guess Word should get the directionality right before implementing font instructions.
    Even if you get it work -space wise- it still is not supported in Word for Mac.

    \r\n\r\nAs for the Eogonek, I did look at the Polish howto\u2014but it\u2019s
    still the first time I\u2019ve drawn one, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve ever
    had an opportunity to see one in use. I\u2019ll keep at it. "

    I guess the 'rtl' issue was never an issue!
