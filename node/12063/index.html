		<div class="commentbody">This is sort of related to the the bug I was experiencing before. As long as the URL does not get prefixed with the www subdomain, I appear to be logged in. If I go away from Typophile for a while (say, I actually have to get some work done...) and return using a link or bookmark which includes the www subdomain, It appears that I am no longer logged in. Once I click another link within the Typophile site, the www is not used and I am magically logged in again.

This must have something to do with the domain specificity of your cookies. Perhaps redirecting or doing a mod_rewrite on all www.* requests to a subdomainless address would resolve the issue.

You guys are running this site on Apache, right?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for Typophile 2 guys!  I've been awaiting this eagerly for a long time!  I really appreciate all your hard work!

Okay, here's the bug report.

* It seems that both on IE and FF (on PC) that the first post in every thread wraps around the avatar image (if it's long enough) and in subsequent posts it doesn't wrap around the image at all.

* When using FF on the Forums home page when you drag your mouse pointer over the links in the Prolific Posters and Active forum topics sections the headlines (or second versions of them) flicker above them (around 100 pixels).

* At the bottom of the page where you're able to send instant messages the Go! button is located underneath the grey box instead of inside it.

I love the news section, and everything else about the site... I haven't had a chance to explore too much yet.  Plus the headlines are really great-looking (where you use that font-substition tech).

Will we be able to use our real names (next to the messages) when we post?  I really liked that about Typophile, that people weren't hiding behind aliases and you know who's who.

Thanks again for all the great work... this is all I can think of at the moment.

Here are a couple bugs to report:

I wanted to become an Uppercase member, but the link is broken. I tried to email the bot, first and my message was returned. So now I'm posting here. 

I'm trying to give you money and I'm getting shut down. Guess my credit's no good at Typophile</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Couple of more bugs:

* It seems that when you log in to the site the Username and Password input boxes look different (IE and FF on PC).  Username box is not as tall as the Password box, it has a light grey border while the Password box has a dark grey border.  And on FF the Password box's border turns blue when your typing something inside it (focus); this doesn't happen with the Username box.

* Instead of quotes and apostrophies I see &#xy; codes in the list of forum topics and in the title bar of the browser.

* Also when your reading a forum thread the great-looking headers with the thread topic doesn't show up on all pages (both IE and FF).

* Also the image for the smileys used in old posts seems to be broken.

Let me know if I'm being too nit-picky, just trying to help.  :)

Thanks!  I've got it changed now.  Now we'll have to get everybody to change their usernames so that we know who we're talking to.  It took me a while to figure out who "formlos" is.  :)

Although the ability to change your username without re-registering is great but it might lead to chaos if people constantly change their usernames or try nabbing other peoples'.</div>

Yeah, that would be best solution.  Have a username for login purposes and then use your full name throughout the site.  I tried logging out, and then using my old username to log in and that didn't work, so I had to use my full name (case insensitive) to gain access to Typophile.

Also, it would be nice to have some space between your username + time stamp and your message.  Because the way it is now, the username with the timestamp looks like it's part of the message.  This could be solved with some space, having your username in bold, a different color, put it in a box, or have a horizontal rule underneath the username.  (Typophile 2.0 is still beta so I'm not too worried about all this).</div>

I figured it was you after checking out your profile (by clicking on the T avatar; maybe the username should eb clickable as well?).  And from there I followed the link to your website and got your full name.  After seeing people's real names for so long usernames don't mean that much... so "formlos" is pretty indistinguishable from "PantyRaider056".  :)</div>

My request for new password on my old user name ‘billyb’ did not get a response, though the site posts a message that the password was sent.

I registered anew, and then tried again to get a new password for ‘billyb’ using my e-mail address. That responded under the new registration. Is my old user name dead?

I agree with Stephen Coles about the background - too little contrast, the old way was better.

		<div class="commentbody">First impressions ar hard to give. The new site is easy on the eyes, but hard on my patience. I second other posts about the speed (read: lack of). It's a lot slower than the old one -- and that was no speed demon either.
Furthermore I noticed coding instead of ampersands and apostrophes (eg #39;). Is that browser related or a bug or due to transferring the old files?

Of an other order: why is my identity not saved in a cookie or whatever? I hate having to log in each time I connect...

Oh yeah: the added wiki has enormous potential. Cheers all around.

A minor (but still annoying) bug I've noticed is that the IM box at the top never goes away (even though it's been 1 hour since I received this message), and sometimes it multiplies itself on the screen (at this moment there are +/- 20 identical IM boxes with the same message, date, etc).

Ok, my list:

 - server seems slow. Page loads take quite a while
 - the site is still WAY too wide for my browser. Any change of implementing a liquid-width design?
 - the time stamps on the post list are formatted in long text based on 'x minutes ago'. This is pretty useless. Very hard to scan through. Just put the date/time there.

Otherwise, looks great. VERY nice to see plain HTML formatting for replies...that'll make things SO much easier.

One other thing that gets lost easily is the "paging" numbers at the bottom. Possibly a bold red may help to bring these numbers out. For example I read this thread several times before I realised there were multiple pages.</div>

The use of Flash is rather questionable at best, but if you really insist, you should use a custom DTD that makes it legal. At no time do you need width and border attributes or the font element. I also don't think Typophile's use of the b element fits within the edge case where it's appropriate. Quite possibly you are also afflicted with a case of divitis.

It would not take very long to fix these problems. You'd still be less compliant than any of the type sites Jérôme Vogel has developed, but at least your markup is better than, say, Speak Up's.

Jared, Joe and anyone involved: This upgrade is sublime. Very elegant. My only suggestion would be to make the name, date and time that appear at the top of each comment to be bold. That way you would be able to skim the conversation quicker since those avatar thingies are sometimes non-descriptive.

Clicking on it would lead me to believe that I'll jump right to the beginning of the new posts. However, that doesn't happen. (Take this thread, for example).

Statistically, 60% of the US has 1024 x 768 or greater screen widths. We decided that since our audience is mostly comprised of designers and design educators that it's much more likely that you can accommodate larger widths. We intentionally kept the body area neatly kept under 800 px to account for the exceptions like yourself. In those cases it is only the login and advertising that you're missing in that column. This allows us to get richer functionality without clogging up the footer.

* Since I'm a good boy and rarely say 'never', I'll just say it sucks most of the time. =) Show me a site that looks good at any width and I'll show you <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> .</div>

I agree, liquid screen width does not always work too well with bigger screens or the new widescreens.  My screen's 1680 pixels wide and if I have my browser maximized and encounter liquid designs they usually look too spread apart, or lines are way too long and hard to read.  But there's always liquid designs that don't get bigger but only smaller... For example you could have a maximum width of 1030 pixels, and the liquid design would adapt to browser windows smaller than that, but then you would run into problems with columns being too narrow.  It's been a while since I read about maxwidth and minwidth, but if I recall correctly, the properties aren't that widely supported.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>it’s much more likely that you can accommodate larger widths

I'm sorry to say this, but the long lines are a fundmental typographical mistake, and very offputting, though in a way that people generally would not be able to put their fingers on.  

Bringhurst says that "45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of a line for a single column page set in a seriffed typeface in a text size." And a line of 66 characters he thinks ideal. He goes on to say "Even with generous leading, a line that averages more than 75 or 80 characters is likely to be too long for continuous reading."

I couldn't figure out why I felt so uncomfortable with the new design until I read the comments from others on the width. Then I counted characters, and I think I got up to 110. This is totally unsatisfactory.

I found in my own experimentation on Bringhurst's recommendation that, to my eye, line length, in terms of characters, together with leading are the most important factors in comfort in reading - generally more important than typeface. 

Please please please change the line length to a comfortable measure. </div>

Regarding line length. One of the things that keeps Typophile unique is that we try to promote showing, instead of always telling. The critique and type id boards are some of the most useful 'features' because people are showing work in-line with the threads. So, that's why we opted for a full-width content area for the forums. What has yet to be resolved is the CSS that controls line length for text and allows images to span the body area.</div>

I did some quick tests, and it seems if you use paragraph tags on all forum posts and add this to your style sheet:

<code>.content p { width: 500px; }</code>

And even if you have images withing the paragraph tags they extend to their full widths without stretching the text all way.  Not sure how it'll jive with the rest of your styles... but you can always give it a quick try.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kudos for fixing the author line!  It looks a lot better with the smaller font and the added space underneath.

A few small bugs:
<ul>
<li>On the <a href="http://typophile.com/forums">forums home page</a> you can't see any info about the critique section (Topics, Posts, and Last Post).</li>
<li>The breadcrumbs don't use consistent title case; <em>forums</em> is all lower case.</li>
<li>On IE but not on FF, the forum posts seem to indent 3 pixels underneath the avatar image (slight image wrapping).</li>
<li>When viewing a list of topics in the different <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/4">forum sections</a>, maybe have <em>Last Post</em> instead of <em>Last Reply</em> since all threads don't have replies?  Because now some of them say <em>n/a</em> and you can't follow the chronology the posts that well.  But if there's no replies this would have the same info as <em>Created</em>.  I suggest that the <em>Created</em> field would have the date and time, while the <em>Last Reply</em> field have the time that has transpired.</li>
<li>Maybe have less space around a list?  Same as between paragraphs.</li>
</ul>

I bet I'm sounding like a nightmare client by now.  But if didn't love Typophile I wouldn't care either.  Thanks for all you hard work!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><strong>The Width Issue&trade;:</strong> I hear Joe about the need to allow space for large images, but these are so uncommon on Typophile that it seems a waste of space to force the column (now 685px wide) to leave room for them <em>all</em> the time. Check out how the beautifully functional <a href="http://www.yayhooray.com/thread/997/Must-Find-Robex">YayHooray</a> manages the issue. The content column width is static, sized for text and smaller images (though maybe a tad too wide at 600px). On the <a href="http://www.yayhooray.com/thread/42226/The-New-Typophile-Is-Live">rare occasion</a> that an image extends beyond the column, that image floats, and the line width for text remains. I feel strongly this is both the most aesthetic and practical solution. Just shave a few pixels off the width.

On another note, though I preferred names and posting times in the left column, the new style is perfect. Thank you!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is more of a feature request. I'd like to be able to get an RSS feed for a single thread. For example, I like to know immediately when someone posts to a certain few critique threads which I'm following closely. This is more interesting to me than knowing when a new critique is started, especially since new critiques begin infrequently but can last for months. If this is implemented, I'd like it if it was hooked up with a <link> tag so I can subscribe by clicking the RSS address bar button in Safari.

This might count as a bug. The Uppercase Blog RSS feed items don't say which blog the item comes from. There's an author field for RSS items. That might be a nice place to stick the name of the author from who's blog the item was aggregated. Admittedly it is kinda fun to guess who the author might be from the content and style, but still, I'd rather have it fixed.

Blue sky thinking here. I liked how the old typophile could email you about any thread you've participated in. So posting to a thread was the way you indicated that you wanted to be kept up to date on the thread. It's a bit of a technical challenge I think to get that working efficiently with RSS but I'd to have something similar.</div>

I think Stewf Coles has the right idea there for handling images. Comfortable column sizes shouldn't restrict image sizes. Large images shouldn't make text hard to read.

About the left hand column. I like it empty like it is now. Now that I've been reading threads for a bit and now that everyone is choosing an icon, the blank space works to delimit the posts and makes it easier for me to scan to the right spot faster. Maybe the user names could be bold. I agree that the name used for the author of the post should be the "Full Name" and not the login.

About the empty right hand gutter, I'm with Frank Jonen on this. Lots of room that could be used for more controls. Maybe stick some thread pagination controls there. It'd beat having to scroll to the bottom of a thread to find the link that shows the most recent page.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another solution on the problem of too many characters per line: make the type bigger. This will reduce the measure in characters per line, but keep the broad width for posting graphics, which is a good thing. I noticed that Tiffany, in another thread misread something, and put it down to small characters. With old guys like me, it is an even bigger problem. Have mercy! Also, have you now changed the text now to fully black? Still the contrast has problems. Bigger text would help solve this also...

The names of those posting is also too small for me, out of balance.

The moving 5 at the top was cute at first, but quickly wore out its welcome. And the  outlying info at the right is ungainly. I agree with those who have said it should be at the top.

I love the new news feed feature, and am looking forward to exploring the Wiki feature. But count me as definitely not a fan of the new typography, which is seriously hard to read. :(

I'll only say this once: fixed-width sites that are way too wide for my browser view port suck.

;o)

<em>Statistically, 60% of the US has 1024 x 768 or greater screen widths.</em>

That would mean something if screen resolution had something to do with browser viewport size. But it doesn't.

If you want fixed width, fine...I'm not going to fight it...it is your site after all ;o)

But there doesn't seem to be a strong reason TO go with fixed width...especially for forums. Ever time I visit your site, I need to stretch out my browser wider and hide my bookmarks pane...kind of a pain. ;o)

Granted, you moved to an all-CSS layout which is really nice, and means I can futz with the CSS myself to make it work as I need to, so we're all happy in that sense. ;o)

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that in forums a slightly larger font size might be a good idea. The lines do seem a bit wide for comfort. BTW do you use a pt size or a pixel size CSS? I haven't checked. It may be that on a PC the fonts look fine but they shink on a mac - hence the winging. I guess I'll have to check. If thats the case then a pixel size would solve the problem no?

Also- I really like the new features - My forum discussions.
& Active forum discussions. It would be cool to elevate them in the Ui so they were easier to access. Sometimes I read & read & the regular UI is fine but sometimes I am hoping to find out if anybody has answered my question or replied in which case the new links aree what I want & right away!

I do kind of miss the 'venacular' photos. ( Sorry mr. Hoefler - I know you hate the term but your suggested substitute is too windy for me! ). It's nice to see things in use! It's nice to see the physicality & contexts.

I have been assuming that like the other greyed out UI elements the search is not up yet. Correct?

Maybe the IM stuff should be in it's own window...

I wouldn't mind it is the account info was intergrated back into the main UI & if the main UI was formated/css text. The site would loook pretty & minimal even with a dense UI header!

Also, I've subscribed to a few of the other feeds, and they have stuff that's not in the main feed, which is supposed to have it all, right?

Also, I think it's imperative you add updates for comments, if only because right now that's the only way we can even kinda replicate the behavior of the old site, where comments on threads we've created or commented on get e-mailed to us. That was an unusual but extremely useful feature, and I think the new Typophile is feeling less interactive for want of it.</div>

Comments I make on forum threads show up in the tracker with the author of the original post that started the thread, but when I went in to the wiki to correct a trivial typo in the entry [[John Butler]] wrote for himself, the tracker started showing me as the author! That's counterintuitive. It seems to me that forum threads should show the name of the most recent commenter, and wiki entries should stick to the original authors more often than not. Or modify the tracker to have a column for author and another column for commenter / editor.</div>

I miss the image upload for showing font matching/simulation samples on the Type ID Board, but I saw statements that it was coming back. Good.

I also agree with wanting real names displayed. I keep having to check profiles to be sure I know who some login names really are.

Generally I am excited about many of the improvements -- it's almost like moving into a new house in a new neighborhood, and yet finding that most of your friends are still living nearby. 

I think what we are experiencing now is the result of trying to do too many things at once in a quantum leap upgrade. Some of it will take getting used to; some of it should evolve into something that we can all understand and use (Typowiki). <strong><em>There should be more and better tutorials for people who have not lived with these changes for the past x months.</em></strong> It would be nice not to have to know HTML to be able to format replies, but I'm learning (but not liking) to do more typing to get the end result I want on screen.

I know you're all working hard. Thanks for trying to make it something we all said we wanted, even if it may have been too much to bite off at once.

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, I'm an addict.
I eventually got sent my password, so I'm back.
I'm sure I will get used to the redesign, but will continue to curse it, just as i continue to curse all versions of Photoshop since 5, FontLab, InDesign, and OS X. What they have in common: too cute, too cluttered. in short, overdesigned. 

I'm not against new functionalities, and can sympathize with all the hard work that's gone into the Typophile revision. But I'm disappointed that the basic design of the threads is so poor:

1) Avatars too close to main column
2) Avatar format (square) unsuitable for portraits.
3) Main measure too wide
4) Main column flow interrupted by poster names, date, and reply.
5) First post type size way too big in comparison to basic text size.

Please:

1) Put some space between the avatar and the main column. An asymmetric, modernist (flush left) layout needs "white" space between elements.

2) Make the avatar shape portrait-proportion, which is natural for the shape of the human head.

3) Reduce the column character-count: typographic wisdom puts a good character-count in the 40s, but I'm getting over 100 here, which is severely dysfunctional according to most legibility and readability theories, and rarely appears in general usage, because it simply does not work.

4) Move the poster's info under his/her avatar icon. That's where it belongs.

5) Don't put the intial post in display-size type. The intial post is not a headline, it is usually a number of sentences. That much copy does not belong in display size. It would not even be OK for the brief title of the thread to be huge, because with no "stepping stone" to the main text, the disparity is too great. When headline-size type appears in magazines and newspapers, there is usually an intermediary deck.</div>

These aren't bugs exactly - but I have two issues with the redesign:

1. I think the initial post in a thread is WAY too big. It's fine for a brief comment but when there is a lot of text it looks like it's for the visually impaired. See, for example, the FAQ on the Type ID forum:

http://typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq

Scoffer, if you use Firefox, I made a fix for this:

http://mnteractive.com/tag-teaming-the-fixed-width-web-site/

A few more minor issues:

I'm guessing this site *is* running Plone? Like another Plone site I visit, it can't seem to keep me logged in. I have to re-log-in every time I visit. That's a bit annoying. 

Also, related to that, does every comment need the 'register or log-in to post' line? Seems way redundant. Maybe just put that at the bottom of each page? (Or better yet, somehow get the system to keep us logged in?)

On my machine, a PC, and monitor, 96 dpi, it shows the same as the 9 pt Georgia that I type in my e-mail. And this is whether I use IE or Firefox as a browser.

It's the web. You simply can't get dictate the exact typeface, size, etc. to your entire audience and expect them all to see exactly that. 

<em>Thanks Aluminum, but that’s too much hassle.</em>

Scoffer. It's actually only a few clicks if you use Firefox. 

1) Go here:

http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/

and Click on the 'Install Greasemonkey 0.3.3' link

2) close your browser

3) go here:

http://mnteractive.com/tag-teaming-the-fixed-width-web-site/

and right-click on the script I made and choose 'install greasemonkey script'

4) done. Now Typophile fits YOUR browser. ;o)

But yea, if you don't use Firefox, then it's not quite as easy.

sIFR isn't a huge deal.

Hehe...don't worry. That was just a generic disclaimer. Mainly hinting that there's probably a better way to write the script.

But the script, itself, isn't doing anything harmful. I'm just going through the page and changing the width of a variety of items from a fixed pixel width to a percentage width so that the page content will be fluid and fill my browser to whatever size I prefer.

It's also a fairly simple script, so if anyone wants to modify it to fit a specific fixed width, they shouldn't have too much trouble figuring it out.</div>

With nearly half of the responders to the survey wanting bigger type, maybe we'll get our shorter measure. After all, almost nobody wants smaller type, which I think means half can live with larger, and half positively want it. 

I have been nagging on this, which is maybe counter-productive, but with the survey and more of us singing the same song, maybe Joe and Jared will see our great wisdom and change it --it is still in 'beta'.

Other than the ability to contribute to the Wiki (the instructions for which are quite evident), how does one actually get to see what has been contributed? I can't find a portal. Is there one? An index? directory? Something seems to be missing.

Also: I agree there might be a civil or tactical reason to comply with a request like this, but I think it's only a good idea when we owe the person something; generally I think it's too censorial. Especially when you consider that all the offended person has to do is edit the wiki (even just to add something like "this wiki is not endorsed by such-and-such", if that person is gracious).

1. would it be possible to add the available page numbers of a thread at the typophile.com/forum/xy... lists to make it possible to get to the last entry without having to choose the first page, scroll down to the bottom line and then choose "last page"?

2. just in case somebody has not ticked the box in the browser to allow cookies being set: it would be helpful if there's a line beneath the registration boxes saying that registration is only possible through allowing cookies first.</div>

Could there be a place where we could view a list of reported and/or outstanding issues and bugs? This could be similar to the notice on the main <a href="http://typophile.com/wiki/start">Typowiki</a> page.

I think it would be handy for folks to be able to see a compiled list of bugs. Perhaps there could be also be some sort of status/priority indicator or an ETA for a fix pertaining to each item. It's rather tedious to go through the multiple pages of this bug reporting thread to see if something that you've discovered has been reported already.

Just a thought.

I think that there is a limit to how much data the system can handle when posting changes to one of those pages. If you take a look at the [[Designers]] page, you'll notice that the entries stop after [[Boul Yvan]], where if you actually edit the page contents, the entries include several designers after that under the 'Z' heading.

Another thing I noticed is after editing the page and previewing, the changes appear on the preview - but disappear when you save the changes.</div>

Um. Since when? Maybe if you’re still running Exploder 5 on Puma."

What's Puma? The 10.1? And yes, I'm running Explorer 5 on MacOs9.2.1. And this is only because Firefox doesn't seem to be available for Mac Os9.x. Which I intend to keep, say, forever, at least on this Macintosh. If someone gives me the money to buy a new Mac, I'll be glad to use OsX as well.

Flash work quite fine anyway, although I don't like flash-based menus, as they force the opening of new directories in the same browser window.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had severe trouble creating a new account with safari. I had to:

1. Create a new email account (my real one is linked to my old account via typophile.com alias which seems busted -- or at least I never received emails)
2. Once I received the password at the new email address, it wouldn't work using safari. I had to switch over to Camino
3. Then I could login and change my password.
4. Once I did that, i could login with safari.

It took me this long to work up enough steam to charge through the registering process. Streamlining might bring back some missing participants.

BTW: I like the redesign very much. As will unfamiliar things, it takes getting used to. We can piss and moan all we want about how things should be better. Ultimately, you could be sitting on a beach sipping a cold beverage out a hollow fruit (or spending time with your families, or...), but instead choose to labor on this beloved gift. Jared, Joe and Christian: thank you.

Are we wrong, right, or is it hard to fix? I don't know. 

You don't notice it with a short separate line or a few, like this.

But compare the following with the above:

		<div class="commentbody">I think the semantic markup could use some tweaking:

I noticed that when viewing an entry on the wiki, the title of the page is "| wiki content | Typophile." Of course, it should read "Entry Title | wiki content | Typophile" for search engine effectiveness. Also, the title of the entry is in a hierarchically weak "p" tag when an "h1" or "h2" would be more appropriate. This is great information, and no one will find it on search engines if it isn't marked up right.

The site looks great. Keep up the good work.

		<div class="commentbody">I guess I'll post this here. I'm sorry if it has already been answered elsewhere but the search seems to be disabled.

I used to use the email notification to stay atop these forums, in particular the competitive type ID board. I've subscribed to the RSS feed but I only get an update on that every 30 minutes vs. every 1 minute with the old system. I assume email notification has been disabled? If so can anyone recommend a mac RSS reader that can be set to update more often than once every 30 minutes?

Every thread I hit on the type ID board has already been resolved by the time I'm notified of its presence. I can't get my fix.

Thanks.

Oh, and it seems there's a problem with escape characters showing up (are you using mySQL?) for example <strong>I'll</strong> is escaped <strong>I\'ll</strong>. I'm sure on the backend it makes sense, but it's a little odd that it doesn't get parsed correctly before being displayed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not a bug report!

Implementation issue:
In general I'm very impressed by the typophile websites, but I have one quibble:
Why is the homepage flash-based? Any technical/functional reasons? Is it to allow the multiple scroll panels? I am wondering cause I personally find it a bit annoying not to be able to open highlighted items in separate tabs from there (I almost always open various posts in a number of tabs so I can browse for instance "critique" and "design" at the same time, so to speak) Sure it should be possible to implement a similar functionality with CSS, no?

		<div class="commentbody">OK, about the "access denied" thing, this is what I have figured out so far. It appears that the Wiki is making up incorrect addresses for some of the links, and the addresses are case sensitive. For example, when you click on the "Indicies" link, it uses this address - http://typophile.com/wiki/indices. But it should be this - http://typophile.com/wiki/Indices. The difference is the cap "I" on "Indices" in the address.

Another example: This link to Blackletter - http://typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter, should have a lower case "b". So there doesen't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the link names case.

I have also found this kind of link - http://typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif, which dosen't work. the "%20" part of that address represents a "space", so that is OK. But if I change the first "s" to a "S" then it works. Hmmm.

I have also found this oddity. In a Wiki link to a string like " Barnhart Brothers & Spindler", it will truncate it to "Barnhart Brothers", ignoring everthing after the "&"... sometimes... not all the time.

I think I understand the -Title Link|Title Displayed- syntax, but I don't think everyone gets this. Not everyone is going to type -American Type Founders|ATM-. And since there is not a real search yet, it is sometimes hard to tell if a Wiki link does not have an entry or if it is not linking properlly to an existing entry. I guess we just have to police this as best we can to try to avoid multiple entrys.</div>

That's a decision you should make, not the web site. It's trivial to open a page in new window or tab in most browsers.

I'm not sure if anyone reads this thread anymore, but the lack of TITLES in a lot of the threads (is this the comma bug?) is becoming an increasingly common problem.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, new bugs in the Wiki. Now am getting this kind of thing:
http://typophile.com/wiki/designers
That gives you two links like this:
• Designers
• Designers

When I click on the first one, it takes me here: http://typophile.com/node/12016 (Which is an "Access denied"). You will notice that this is a node that has a number instead of an alphanumeric name, so I can‘t just manually change the case to make it redirect me properly, because I have no idea what the number represents.

And when I click on the second link, it takes me here: http://typophile.com/wiki/Designers (Which is an "Access denied" because the case is wrong)

If I fix the case, it takes me back to the beginning:
http://typophile.com/wiki/designers
• Designers
• Designers

So, I am now effectively locked out. I have found this in several places so I am not sure if it is a Wiki bug, or if somone is making these. But this page: http://typophile.com/wiki/designers doesn't give you the option to edit.

(To whom it may concern, to put my comments in context: I am using OSX.3 and Safari)</div>

2. Not a bug exactly, but a possible way for the Critique section to show up as to posting info:

1. Put a subhead 'critique' without any link.
2. below that have 5 categories: serif, san serif, script and other, logos & corp ID, and typography.
3. Combine the 'Build' and 'Release' into one section. 

This way you would probably still have the key infor on the front page without scrolling, and have activity in the critique section show on the front page. The combining is based on the numbers of postings on these sections. I don't know if this would cause any problems for the archives. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not a bug, more a suggestion, related to ones above about consolidating categories: Start a new category called Superlists, or Resources, or something to indicate that collective lists of favorite Book faces, lists of Humanist Sans, Geometric Sans, lists of Fleischmann revivals, Informal scripts, etc. can be found easily without archaeology. It could be like FAQ, or part of FAQ, since so many inquiries come in along these lines. Typophile is becoming a real hub of typographic wisdom thanks to the wiki and the collective knowledge base, so maybe we start archiving the non-wiki info somewhere else. 

I like the ideas listed above about getting critique to show up at the top level. That is an important area and it's getting hidden. Fewer categories though. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh a few things. (After using the new typophile a while I start to get ideas.)

Many have mentioned that it would be good to have the selection of the thread default to the latest posting--or lacking that have the 'page menu' at the top of the thread as well as the bottom. 

In addition to that, it would be good to have the category menu visible, so that you could navigate to other categories without going back to 'forums'.

Thanks for narrowing the measure of the text. It would be still better if reduced by another 20%, according to Bringhurst (and me), but it's a lot better now. 

Finally on the issue of contrast, which a few people commented on initially. Over-45 year old eyes don't have as clear a liquid in them, I believe, which is why brighter light is better for reading printed matter then. But I think it also affects perception of contrast. Maybe that's why the old geezers like me complain about black against the grey--or is it two shades of grey--instead of black on white. Maybe someone who is knowledgeable about these things can chime in and correct or confirm my suspicions on this. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul,

I'm not looking for anything. I'm trying to figure out how to match up inquiries like the ones I've mentioned, with resources in the wiki. From the standpoint of a new visitor, how are any of the existing indices more descriptive? Refer to the sample inquiry, which is a real one from an unrelated thread: "What are some good typefaces for me to set books in for extended reading?" If I was new to Typophile, or had been thwarted in trying to use the wiki, what would be an intuitive place to look? Type For Books isn't really a class or style, yet, so.... 

It may be that this is appropriate for regular threads. But when questions become FAQs, I think about making the content re-accessible. Even if it doesn't end up in the wiki, some way to archive, or refer to, threads that address such issues would be nice. Maybe I should switch to firefox so I can use search... ;)

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, I am in Firefox (on a PC) and for me the Typowiki is really pretty unusable. When I click on something it usually gives me an 'access denied' message. When I change the case of the letter after the rightmost slash I usually get in and see the page. 

This is truly a 'bug', and it makes the wiki not really usable, which is a pity, as it is potentially a very good resource. 

Also, as mentioned before not everything is linked through the indices. When something goes out of the 'newly posted' column and is not indexed, where does it go--to typowiki heaven? 

Is there an alphabetical listing accessible? It would be good if there were. Then people--with instruction--could also create links to the indices. The typowiki will really only be useful if it has a good index, with everything connected to it.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">i suspect that permissions for general typophile users are not set to the proper level for the [[typowiki]] and that is why there are so many "access denied" messages. in some cases wiki links like [[Essential Typefaces]] will not work, but some fiddling will give users access. for example, http://typophile.com/wiki/essential_typefaces <em>should</em> work, but i'm not sure if this type of thing works for all users. 
i think this is very unfortunate that this is happening so much (in some cases some users get "access denied" when trying to access the wiki start page!) as i think it is impeding the wiki to be able to really get off the ground. hopefully this can be solved soon... in the meantime, i hate to ask you to be patient, but i'm afraid there's nothing more that i can do than what i have been doing.

Might today be the start of such a life? School seems to be open but we're not allowed in. Access denied! Access denied! Access denied! Access denied! Access denied! Access denied! 

Have the rules been changed? Do we need to have 2 tails, purple eyes and paws growing out of our ears to be allowed to read a forum - or even see one? Or has the Kat dome something wrong? Like just reading and not writing?
Let me in pse.

Example:
<code>&lt;a href="user/666" ztyle="display: block; width: 60px; height: 60px; background-image: url(666.gif); background-repeat: no-repeat;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>

This would translate to the following implementation:
<code>&lt;a href="user/666" class="avatar" ztyle="background-image: url(666.gif);"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>

With the following info in the style sheet:
<code>.avatar {display: block; width: 60px; height: 60px; background-repeat: no-repeat}</code>

P.S. All the code would not display so: ztyle = style.  For tiling smaller than 60x60 avatars, just repeat the background.</div>

for instance:

http://typophile.com/images/features/type110intro.swf 

Thats my work around.

It turns out I have flash 7 & that appears to be what is called for so.... I am still not sure why it doesn't jusy work in the window it's embeded in. I tried to copy the file over but I don't seem to be able to. Maybe in another browser...

I have a usability request. On long topics, such as this one, the only place I can see to get to the subsequent pages is near the bottom of the page. It would streamline things if the page numbers and 'next page' 'last page' links were also included at the top of each page of the topic.

It can get to be a lot of scroll-wheel action to get to the bottom of some of these pages when the content I want is on page 2 or 3.

Thanks for considering.</div>

Almost everytime I’m redirected via an external link to the Typophile forums I receive the Page Not Found page and it’s pretty frustrating.

		<div class="commentbody">ok, so this is not a bug but a suggestion:

when someone adds attachements to the posts, its often confusing because there are different versions and you dont know to open which one, etc. etc.. why not add a date-collumn beneath the name and the size of the document? not for the attachements already added, but for the new ones.

i know you surely have lots of stuff to do, but please take this suggestion into consideration.
thanks!</div>

Perhaps the images are served directly from a table in the forum database.

If the table referencing the image data became corrupted, then no images can be served. That, or maybe somebody accidentally deleted all the files...

How about a preference to just dump all the flash as it seems to be causing more problems than anything?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the problem richard hards named a few posts ago (IE6-users have to "accept" flash-parts) is pretty easy to work around. it isnt microsofts fault and it probably wont change, so this may be your best bet.

i know some big sites who use it, so there really shouldnt be a problem with this.

------------

Microsoft have just started to roll out an update that changes the way IE handles ActiveX controls:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/

MS offer a few work arounds, but all of them involve altering the way the object tag is written to the page, but here is a much easier solution that I came up with:

Create a new javascript file called, say. ieupdate.js containing the 4 lines of code at the end of this post.

Then, at the bottom of any page containing Flash (or Shockwave, Quicktime etc) add a reference to this file:
<script type="text/javascript" src="ieupdate.js"></script>

And that is it!

It works simply by replacing the contents of the object tag with itself. This external rewritting of the tag is enough for IE accept that your code doesn't require user activation. The outerHTML feature only works in IE, but as IE is the only affected browser that is OK.

You could test for IE using your favourite method (document.all, etc), and instead of adding it to the bottom of the page you could add the code to a window.onload function, depending whatever is best for your site.

If users have JavaScript turned off then your site will work as before.

Hope some people find this useful.

==========================
Attach Code

theObjects = document.getElementsByTagName("object");
for (var i = 0; i < theObjects.length; i++) {
theObjects[i].outerHTML = theObjects[i].outerHTML;

		<div class="commentbody">Typophile has one bit o' weirdness that still irks me now and again. Unlike most sites, when you scroll toward the bottom of a long screen, click on some link there, and then hit back - Typophile puts you at the top of the page, not where you were. Gets annoying with long threads, where you constantly have to refind you place. 

Don't know if this is a function of the Flash header, or what, but I'd love to see it fixed.

Of course, for the record, Typophile is an amazing community and resource, and you all do great work. Thank you.

I’m using Safari and it works just like it should. I think it’s up to the browser, not the site.

But when you click the <em>new</em> button of a topic, you get the new posts only if it’s a single page thread. It would be nice to get to new posts no matter how many pages there are.</div>

I have a clipping on my desktop that contains "?from=0&comments_per_page=500". To use it, I first copy the (lengthy) thread link, paste it in the browser address field, open the clipping file, copy and then paste onto the end of the link address.

It would be so much easier if there was a setting in my user profile that let me control the maximum number of posts per page.</div>

And after you post a message, the forum returns to the first page of a multi-page thread. I believe this was also the case with the previous forum, and it is annoying as hell. It should return to the message you just posted, or at least the last page.

Yes, but I meant in the red square around it. That one has an indent on the left, the line is not straight.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Firebug's Net profiler shows the pages are weighing around 150KB. Considering the images and Flash elements, it's a good measure. I think some simple adjustments can improve this website's performance and especially its loading time <em>perception</em>.

For instance, instead of having 10 separate small CSS files, merge them into a single file. Too many requests bog down the server.

The Flash masthead and title are taking too long to show up on page. JQuery's $(document).ready is being used, but I think it's worth trying a regular <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at the bottom of the page (before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>) instead. I've come to the conclusion that this is the best way to ensure the fastest initialization of JS-generated elements on page.

I like the featured font and the fact that you can get to the texts seen in the front page. I see I have to fix my avatar, it's too distorted.</div>
