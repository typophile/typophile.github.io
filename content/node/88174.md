  body: "It seems like a rather strange combination of a <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/frankfurter/|Frankfurter
    Medium]]</strong> with the /S of an <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/arial/rounded-mt-bold/|Arial
    Rounded Bold]]</strong> !\r\n(+ a dot in the /Q off course)\r\n\r\nI can't understand
    why somebody would choose this combination,\r\nso I guess I'm simply wrong, and
    this is a font I don't know... :)"

  body: "The S is clearly an addition (it\u2019s shorter than the rest too). It looks
    almost like the original name was Aluminum Techique and when they wanted to change
    it, they din\u2019t have/know the original font anymore. So they added the S from
    Arial Rounded and kept it smaller to retain the stroke weight."

  body: "All the letters which would normally have overshoots look wrong. Top of C
    & Q, bottom of U's in Aluminium, although it looks better in Techniques.\r\n\r\nMy
    thought is that it is all Frankfurter, but was put together by someone who doesn't
    know about overshoots and so they've tweaked those curved letters to sit on a
    guideline drawn from the straighter ones."
