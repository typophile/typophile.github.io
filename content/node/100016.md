  is not mentioned it is only possible with right to left scripts.\r\nBut on other
  sources, there is stated it doesn't work with left to right, like\r\n[[http://glyphsapp.com/blog/arabic]]\r\n\r\n\r\nPs,
  is it required to work with .init and .fina if I want to work with 'curs'?\r\nMost
  times it is done so\u2026"

  body: "There are a few different things to consider here.\r\n\r\nThe first is the
    'curs' OpenType Layout feature, which may or may not be supported for individual
    scripts. It is part of default layout for Arabic, as you note, but I'm not sure
    whether it is in any European script layout engines. When in doubt, experiment.
    \r\n\r\nThe second thing to consider is that 'cursive attachment' is a standard
    GPOS lookup type, as well as being a specific layout feature, so in theory you
    can associate a cursive attachment lookup with any feature you like. So, for example,
    you could experiment with putting cursive attachment lookups in the 'kern' feature,
    and see if/where that works. Risky, because some layout engines might make assumptions
    about lookup types, but I would consider that a layout engine bug because the
    OT spec explicitly states that lookup types should not be assumed.\r\n\r\nThe
    final thing to consider is whether you really need cursive attachment in your
    design. Cursive attachment is <em>necessary</em> when you have both vertical and
    horizontal offsets to joins; if you have horizontal offsets only, you can get
    away with kerning connections and will get more reliable support in more places.
    However, there is a real attraction to using cursive attachment, even for horizontal-only
    offsets, because -- in theory at least -- it locks the two glyphs together so
    that the connection will not break if somone applies tracking."
