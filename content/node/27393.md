  to ignore the 800 x 600 and going for a bigger 1024 x 768 design. This means more
  space - more type options.\r\n\r\nAnyone got any suggestions for web type or websites
  where type is good and well used? Type on the web can be pretty difficult I've read.
  Would appreciate any input for either weblog or type design. Thanks."

    size, and tracking options and go for typefaces that are common on most machines
    which are Arial, Times New Roman, Georgia, and Verdana. My advice is to avoid
    the first two fonts ;)\r\n\r\nIf you're using images as text spaces, then look
    into \"screen fonts\" or \"pixel fonts.\""

  body: "The biggest difficulty is the lack of usable text faces. You got add Trebuchet,
    Tahoma and perhaps Lucida Sans to Cyanide\u2019s list, though. There are also
    Arial Black, Impact, Courier New and\u2026 \u2026sigh, Comic Sans."

  body: "Palatino Linotype is also common (Windows XP), but be sure to provide alternatives
    and don't make it too small. A hint: Book Antiqua and Zapf Calligraphic are nearly
    identical to Palatino.\r\n\r\nWeb type is 99% about line spacing and widths of
    text blocks (if the contrast between background and the type color is already
    sorted).\r\n\r\nBe careful with Verdana, it has a much bigger x-height than other
    popular web fonts. If your type is set in 8px Verdana it will be less legible
    if a browser decides to display it in e.g. Arial. Verdana is found on both Windows
    PCs and Macs, so you won't let down many of your viewers anyway. The biggest problem
    is Linux, but there you have \"Bitstream Vera Sans\" which also has a large x-height.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood
    use of Georgia: <a href=\"http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2006/06/25/letterpress_adventure.php\">Jason
    Santa Maria</a>\r\n\r\nGood use of Arial: <a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/\">Six
    Apart</a>\r\n\r\nGood use of Verdana: <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/\">Mark
    Simonson Studio</a>\r\n\r\nGood use of Lucida Grande: <a href=\"http://www.haveamint.com/faqs\">Mint</a>\r\n\r\nGood
    use of Times New Roman: Can't think of any...\r\n\r\nGood use of Palatino: <a
    href=\"http://blog.fawny.org/2006/06/24/failed3/\">Joe Clark</a>\r\n(you'll see
    it if you don't have \"Constantia\", \"Rockwell\" or \"Serifa\" on your machine)\r\n\r\nGood
    use of Comic Sans:\r\nNever. Or, in some cases, 9px italic. Or not.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also a few new kids on the block: Cambria, Constantia, Calibri, Corbel and
    Candara as well as the monospaces Consolas, but don't count too much on them just
    yet."
