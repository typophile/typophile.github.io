  me to redesign the existing identity.\r\nSee attached [dull sloppy vetica thing
  they have now]\r\n\r\nHas anyone got suggestions for a new typeface for the identity.\r\nBut
  I also want to sell the idea of doing the way-finding with the Architects\r\nAlso
  it will have to be used for catalogs and exhibition work.\r\n\r\nWhat do you suggest?\r\n\r\nThe
  Gallery has an African /South Asian remit but its also contemporary art.\r\n\r\nLove\r\n\r\nMr
  Brown"

    a full set of weights including italics would be required.\r\nBut yes hopefully
    the identity will implemented across everything so donor labels etc\r\nwould all
    come into it.\r\nSomething very modern [thats my favorite word]and European.\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\nMr Brown"

  body: "Well, I was in a similar situation, and the gallery was in a museum district.\r\n\r\nI
    decided to try and use that larger context. I also looked at the range of shows\u2014which
    included everything from contemporary international art to period artifacts like
    clothing and furniture.\r\n\r\nI decided to pick a contemporary serif and combine
    that with more traditional sans so the publications etc. could shift in feel and
    remain within the identity.\r\n\r\nI think Pentagram's work for the DMA is very
    solid, using Fedra Sans is very nice.\r\nhttp://a.velluminous.org/dma.html\r\n\r\nMaybe
    a family like OurType's Fresco and Fresco Sans would work. It would probably function
    well for wayfinding and identity, and have a serif option for extended text in
    a catalogue."

    works well as text and is also particularly suited to signage.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
