  body: Looks nice and casual, though I am not an expert on Devanagari. And I guess
    the text is in Marathi, which is even more alien to me. It is high time we make
    casual and non-formal typefaces in Indian scripts and bring in some much-needed
    vitality into the scene.

  body: That is really beautiful. I cannot read any of the Indian scripts (except
    those based on Arabic) so I see your font as pure abstract calligraphic shapes.
    Inspired by a particular style of Japanese calligraphy I developed my own style
    of brush-drawn Arabic, and some of my shapes resemble some of the curves in your
    font.  Can you please display some large close-ups of a few words or letters with
    your font?  I want to see how you treated the lines - strictly monoline (same
    width) or modulated. If modeulated what criterion did you use to decide where
    it should be thick and where thin?
