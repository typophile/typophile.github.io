  besides the title of his now out of print book? I\xB4ve googled for his name but
  nothing interesting returned besides an article on TypoGraphic 62 called \"The Future
  for the Typographer\". Any info on his biography? When was his book (Finer Points
  in the Spacing & Arrangement of Type) originally written? This guy is a total mystery
  to me..."

  body: "I have the 1995 reprint of his book. Published by Hartley & Marks Publishers,
    Vancouver. There is no biographic info other than this paragraph on the back cover:\r\n\r\n<em>During
    his long typographic career, Geoffrey Dowding was typographer to a number of British
    publishers and agencies. He also served as an instructor in typographic design
    at the London College of Printing for over twenty years.</em>\r\n\r\nOriginally
    published in 1954 by Wace & Company, London. The 1995 reprint is of the 1966 edition
    with a dated (September 1966) Preface by Dowding.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Good
    luck with your research."

    you think the word spacing in that edition is good? I bought a used copy. It is
    readable, but it looks a bit too pinched to me. "

  body: "Bill, I agree with you. So many people quote Dowding without a notion of
    what he had in mind. If you accept that all book composition involves compromises,
    what one can say about Dowding is that he is willing to make any compromise --
    including legibility -- to avoid a lose line.\r\n\r\nIn practice, no modern editor
    would accept many lines in the Wace edition, and a some lines (in my opinion)
    no typographer should accept. I still remember the first time I read the book
    -- Rich Hendel had lent me his copy & about 30 pages in I got so perturbed I called
    him & said something like \"this is nonsense.\" Rich, ever the gentleman, just
    laughed & said \"I though you'd like to read it.\""
