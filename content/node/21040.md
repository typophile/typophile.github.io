body: "I need some type that looks like it is from a 1950s-1960s space program. Not
  like the Jetsons or boomerang-table-hepcat stuff, but something that might actually
  appear on the side of a rocket or test-plane in the early supersonic jet propulsion
  era. \r\n\r\nThere is one in particular that I saw, but I forgot what it was called.
  I think the name of it was a near-meaningless, short mix of letters and numbers,
  and it looked like what you would see painted on the side of a bomber, a bit na\xEFve
  and engineered-looking, the typographic equivalent to a telephone pole. It had an
  tall octagonal shape and was quite stark. \r\n\r\nI am sure there are others, but
  I am stumped as display type is not my specialty. Please help if you can. Thanks!"

    had the chance to visit the Kennedy Space Center this past few days and saw this
    and more at the exhibits.\r\n\r\nBest of all -- we had an AWESOME view of the

  body: "Albeit off topic, but I can't resist... The \"worm\" logo was also called
    the \"spaghetti\" mark. After seeing several shuttle launches from the press center
    in my earlier journalist days, I have a great affinity for NASA and actually prefer
    the historical \"meatball\" logo.\r\n\r\nHere's a page from NASA's site about
    the history of the \"meatball\" logo (http://history.nasa.gov/meatball.htm), with
    this priceless quote:\r\n\r\n<cite>When the meatball was reinstated in 1992, Greg
    Patt, then Graphics Manager for [the Glenn Research Center's] Publishing Services
    contractor, remarked \"It's a design nightmare. It doesn't print well on laser
    printers because of the gradations on the airfoil, and it can't be used at less
    than 5/8 inch because the stars disappear and the type becomes illegible.\" </cite>\r\n\r\nOh,
    and this one, too:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"Meatball\" has also been used for a dull, unattractive
    person and for a penant for battle efficiency or an athletic scholarship. </cite>\r\n\r\nI
    love their honesty on both counts.\r\n\r\nMore about NASA's logos at their Graphics
