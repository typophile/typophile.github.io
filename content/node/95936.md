  someone could help me pair up a typeface.\r\n\r\nWe're under fairly strict confidentiality
  restrictions with this client, but what I can tell you is that the business will
  be operating in the student market throughout Europe. At the heart of the brand
  is a sense of functional simplicity. Nothing is superflous with their products;
  everything is considered, intelligently designed and included for a reason. Style
  is important as well but it's very much a brand that is not consciously trying to
  be cool. As you can see, we're hardly talking distressed/grungy typefaces here.\r\n\r\nThe
  primary headline font is Century Gothic Bold, and we're after a complementary sans
  serif that can be used for body copy, captioning, etc. We've been working with Myriad
  Pro up until now, so I'd welcome your opinion on that as well as any other suggestions
  you can throw up.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nScott"

  body: Have you considered a slab serif? Longer passages of text are rarely served
    well with a sans. Plus with a sans headline, it is much harder to compliment with
    another sans. I am not saying it can't be done, but it is more often done poorly.

    you might have \u2013 be it a sans or slab. Appreciate your rationale though,
    I think we'll cast the net a little wider.\r\n\r\nIf we do stick to a sans, would
    Futura be a good match given it was the inspiration for Century Gothic and is
    more suited to longer passages of text? Or is their similarity precisely the reason
    you wouldn't pick it?"
