  thought to use italic and regular versions to differentiate the 2 languages or use
  regular on both languages but use black for one and gray for the second language.\r\n\r\nWhat

  body: Are the two languages appearing on the same page, or only on facing pages?
    What are the languages? Is one of the languages predominate in the sense of being
    the original language of the text or the language of the principle audience for
    the book (this can be the case, for example, in bilingual literary texts or scholarly
    editions). If the two languages are to be considered of equal importance, then
    you need to come up with a solution that doesn't give the impression of making
    one primary, e.g. by setting it in roman (regular) type and the other in italics.

  body: "Find out which language sets longer (if any). If one language is longer,
    choose a typeface with an italic that has a greater character count per pica.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    try and make the layout consistent, so that when readers turn the page, they are
    anticipating seeing their language in \u201Cits\u201D place. If you achieve this,
    it might be possible to use the same spec for both languages.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    like greying type (unless with a spot color) because it kills the sharpness of
    the type."

  body: "Making one language grey will automatically demote it and give it second
    place, so it\u2019s not something I would do, unless that was intended. Here in
    Canada I would never deal with French and English together that way.\r\n\r\nFor
    photo captions, your bits of text should be relatively short. What you need to
    do is keep the text in the two languages of equal visual colour, yet keep them
    distinct from each other. Going roman/italic is one solution. You could also go
    serif/sans. I wouldn\u2019t worry about varying text lengths as you can accommodate
    them in your design; again, it\u2019s the overall text colour I\u2019d be more
    concerned about, so that one language doesn\u2019t dominate the other.\r\n\r\nAnother
    solution would be simple placement. Put enough space between the two captions
    so it doesn\u2019t look like the reader should read on from the other and keep
    the positions of the captions consistent in relation to the photographs. Not knowing
    the nature of the photos or the trim size of the book, it\u2019s difficult to
    be more specific, but a left/right or top left/bottom right arrangement could
    work in the right design.\r\n"

  body: "I've done a number of these including a three-volume trilingual series. John
    pretty much nailed it. As long as there is no confusion about which language you're
    in as you read (& that in itself would be a strange notion), why would you want
    to graphically say, \"Boy, these languages are different\"? Only if you can come
    up with a reason in a particular case, does the idea makes sense.\r\n\r\nThere
    are other problems, usually one language is not as efficient as the other, so
    if you're going to maintain basically the same place on the page with a side-by-side
    presentation, you have that problem to address. It's easier to solve if you keep
    one language on the verso, one on the recto. If the trim is large & two columns
    would work, that's an option, too. If you want the simultaneity across the page/spread
    really tight, set ragged.\r\n\r\nFootnotes, if used, can be a factor. Here's an
    example. The poetry volume in that tri-lingual series was trouble. Basically,
    the languages used were indigenous, English, and Spanish The editorial decision
    was to have the footnotes in both English and Spanish for the indigenous language,
    and then English with the English & Spanish for the Spanish. As a design, it It
    would have been easy to just have four columns & handle things that way, but the
    editors decided differently (& wrongly, I felt).\r\n\r\nIn another book I did,
    English was so much more efficeient that we set all the footnotes on the \"English\"
    page. Depends on how many & how complex the footnotes are. \r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I think a word in your thread title is important: <strong> editorial</strong>.
    The languages themselves in simultaneous presentations aren't really a graphical
    problem, but the layout can be greatly eased if the editors work with the designer.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "If you are able to maintain consistent positioning of the two language texts
    relative to the images to which they relate, I don't think you need any typographic
    distinction between them. The reader will quickly attune to the positioning convention,
    and immediately locate his or her language on each page.\r\n\r\nIf you find you
    do need to make a typographic distinction, consider pair serif and sans serif,
    since most of the text  per page is presumably quite short."

  body: "<blockquote>the principal is the spanish.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNote that which
    language is the original versus which is the translation does not necessarily
    mean one should <em>look</em> more important. As David opines, that's rarely desirable.\r\n\r\nConcerning
    captions, one trick would be to use them to separate the two languages (like in
    Lane's \"The Diaspora of Armenian Printing, 1512-2012\", although in that case
    the <em>writing systems</em> are different).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Find out which
    language sets longer</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSpanish is typically ~10% longer than
    English, but translation is about ~15% longer than the original, so you might
    be lucky and end up with very comparable lengths.\r\n\r\nBTW for comparative language
    lengths get a copy of \"Typographia Polyglotta\" by Maxim Zhukov and George Sadek.
    Although it's over $100 now, whereas years ago I got mine for ~$20.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>try
    and make the layout consistent</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes, this is key. But to me
    that doesn't make using identical typography (a Modernist fetish) a good idea;
    there is always something different about the two languages/cultures, and being
    sensitive to that difference does not have to result in gimmicky differentiation.
    It is however tricky business, which is why many people give up and pretend making
    them identical is a good solution.\r\n\r\nConcerning specific suggestions:\r\n-
    I think using Roman and Italic is rarely a good idea - the latter is too casual.\r\n-
    Using serif and sans is also problematic: big readability difference in addition
    to a huge formality difference.\r\n- You need subtlety in your solution; check
    out Lisboa - see the first entry here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/on-typography/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2005/\r\nIt's
    not a serif font, but it <em>is</em> suitably Iberian!  :-)\r\n- Consider using
    Rotis (as Aicher did in his monumental book) since it has four flavors, or Linotype's
    comprehensive Compatil system. Note that both of those designs are generally maligned,
    but I don't think they deserve that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
