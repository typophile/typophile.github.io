  any in Kelly\u2019s collection, and they don\u2019t seem to turn up much in period
  posters, but I know that they did exist because <a href=\"http://www.unicorngraphics.com/wood%20type%20museum/hamilton14/hamiltonfourteen.asp\">I\u2019ve
  found an example in an old Hamilton catalog</a>, they\u2019re in the left-hand column
  in that image. Does anyone out there have one of these alphabets, and would you
  be willing to take a photo for me?"

    don\u2019t feature complete alphabets of this style."
