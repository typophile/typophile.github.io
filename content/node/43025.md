  need to make a 6-page spread for the internet TV station Diggnation.\r\n\r\nI would
  very much enjoy using 'Sauna' by Underware as the Title typeface. ([[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=sauna&id2=overview|Underware's
  Sauna here...]])\r\n\r\nWhat do you people recommend me to use for the body copy
  itself?\r\n\r\nI'm a little new at this thing and I just don't have the typographic
  sensitivity (yet) that you guys have!\r\n\r\nThanks a ton for your input,\r\ninnovati!"

    to achieve with the spread, and the magazine \u2013 but since you're using an
    Underware face for display, you might try Underware's excellent text typeface
    Dolly.\r\n"

  body: "I wasn't sure if Dolly was 'mature' enough to work for large bodies of text,
    but I certainly trust you more than my own intuition.\r\n\r\nIf you think it's
    worth it I'll certainly look into getting it!\r\n\r\nI don't know, but Underware
    really seems to have a rhythm to all of their typefaces, what are your thoughts
    on their font \"auto\" in general, I'm not sure what to make of it yet..."

    Auto for nearly everything, including body copy. It works really well, IMHO.

  body: If you like Dolly you will probably like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suitcase/dederon_serif_family/">Dederon</a>.
    The bonus? The companion, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suitcase/dederon_sans_family/">Dederon
    Sans</a>.

  body: "You've picked a tough one.\r\nIt requires a lot of research to find a good
    contrast face for a distinctive hybrid face like Sauna (semi-serif, low contrast,
    large x-height/short capitals).\r\nYou can always use Sauna!"

  body: 'What makes most Underware fonts like Sauna or Auto work is the fact they
    have weights that verge on display faces, and weights that work as body text. '

  body: 'Don''t use Dolly: yes, it''s charming, but it lacks a bold italic, which
    you will need sooner or later, and the base weight is a little too heavy, esp
    if your paper stock is slick. Zingha, Proforma, Bitstream Iowan (available with
    OSFs as a separate bundle), and especially Esta (which is also inexpensive) have
    appeal similar to Dolly with no problems. Poynter Text Roman One, ITC Bodoni 12,
    Filosofia, Warnock, Quadraat, Scala, and Celeste each have a very distinctive
    appeal, but without problems or missing fonts. Take a peek.  '

    a big help :)"

  body: 'Second Miss Tiff on Dederon Serif and Sans--except for the price, $75 per
    font for four weights and 8 fonts! Some of those European boutique foundries are
    way overpriced: this one is Czech so maybe they should emulate Storm''s moderate
    pricing. '
