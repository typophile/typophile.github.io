body: "I've written a library (in clojure, a lisp dialect), to work with parametric
  fonts (in a lisp dialect). You can look at it at github: https://github.com/danielecapo/fonduta,
  the readme file tries to explain how to use it.\r\n\r\nIt was written for my own
  fun, and it is far from being complete, but I decided to release it, because somebody
  (maybe) can find it interesting.\r\n\r\nYou can see a small video [[http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151772596645311&set=vb.906345310&type=2&theater#|here]]."

  body: "Thank you for posting this it looks really interesting, hopefully I will
    be able to try it out soon and give you some feedback.\r\n\r\nSomething about
    the link did not quite work, re-directing to a Typophile wiki generation page.
    Copying and reformatting did the job though."
