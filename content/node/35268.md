  body: "I was a novice designer when DTP was first introduced and font choice was
    extremely limited. Since Palatino was one of the 35 fonts included in the original
    Laserwriter, I saw it (and used it) a *lot*. I mean a *lot*. ;)\r\n\r\nPlus, you
    start to recognize Zapf-isms like the open P and R."
