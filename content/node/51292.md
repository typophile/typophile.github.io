  for Pearson Education. It is an accounting book for University students with sustainability
  or eco-friendly theme. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for any suggestion on a typeface that
  might be suitable? I am a bit bored with my current selection of fonts. So any recommendation
  will be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n[="
