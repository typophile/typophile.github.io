  body: "Ha. That's Alpha Headline from Lineto which hasn't been available for several
    years. \r\nhttp://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Alpha+Headline/\r\n\r\nIt's
    been licensed exclusively to Mitsubishi until 2012. The version I have is all-caps
    and one weight only. Designer Cornel Windlin later added lowercase and other weights,
    but that's unavailable for purchase. Hopefully the full set will be available
    in 2012.\r\n\r\nThere's a similar font available called Mandatory: \r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/k-type.d872?nb_ppp=50\r\n\r\n"
