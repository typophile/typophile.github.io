body: "Hello everybody !!!!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font that can handles every type
  of characters, from the latin alphabet till the cyrillic alphabet via the asiatic
  alphabets (japanese, chinese, ..). I though that Lucida Grande would do it, but
  apparently not (when I embed this font on my appli, it doens't display correctly
  the characters..). With a japanese character I though that I would have manage to
  find it, but unfortunately the russian is craply displayed (with a huge letter-spacing)\r\nSo
  do you know if this magic font exist or how to find it ?\r\n\r\nIn other case, do
  you know how to find the character palette on the mac that would list me all the
  font available on my mac and which alphabet these fonts handle ?\r\n\r\nOr maybe
  a website with fonts and their cover ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any help !!!"

  body: "Depends on what you need, but the short answer is no. There is no such magic
    font. I've yet to come across a font with a broad coverage of different writing
    systems that does each of them justice. MS Arial Unicode is atrocious in this
    respect.\r\n\r\nUse the mix and match approach. Choose a good multi-script font
    that supports a good portion of the writing systems you need as its core design.
    Supplement the writing systems that are missing with fonts that cover them as
    their core designs. If you need a font for Chinese ideographs, use a font designed
    specifically for Chinese or Japanese, not something like MS Arial Unicode. Ditto
    for Thai, Georgian, Greek, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you specify which scripts you need,
    then it will be easier to suggest which fonts you might use. I don't know if you'll
    need the Korean alphabet, but if you do, you could do worse than use Malgun Gothic,
    the font shipped with Windows Vista for Korean. It has comparably decent Cyrillic
    design (although I would like to hear from native Cyrillic readers; ditto for
    its Greek and Japanese components). It only supports the Russian letters, though.
    And it lacks Chinese characters entirely--you would have to choose a comparable
    sans serif font with Chinese character support."

  body: "These days, there are a fair number of typefaces that have decent Latin,
    Greek and Cyrillic in a single font.\r\n\r\nThe problem is getting East Asian
    support in the same font. The particularly thorny problem is dealing with the
    Han unification characters. Basically, for certain East Asian characters, There
    are quite different designs for (1) Chinese versus Japanese and (2) simplified
    Chinese versus traditional Chinese. Currently, the only functional way to distinguish
    them is to build an OpenType font with the 'locl' (locale) feature, and use apps/OSes
    that process that feature correctly for those languages.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how
    widespread such app/OS support is for the 'locl' feature with those languages,
    but I know that such fonts are pretty much non-existent in the wild. AFAIK, thus
    far such fonts have only been built by mad scientists in labs (<i>pace</i> Dr
    Lunde & Mr Meyer).\r\n\r\nBecause of the potential for great efficiency (space
    savings), I imagine we will see such fonts in the wild in the future.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "The following thread went on a lengthy tangent regarding the difference between
    the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese letterforms for the same characters:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/42433\r\n\r\nAs
    I wished in that thread, it would be great to see a font that handles the country-specific
    variations of Chinese characters with the 'locl' feature. The thing is that such
    a font would require the coordination of an international team of experts from
    the different countries that use Chinese characters in addition to the ridiculous
    amount of man-hours needed to design the tens of thousands of glyphs. Thomas can
    confirm this, but I think Adobe has developed Japanese fonts that utilize OpenType
    features for Chinese characters, so Adobe would be a good candidate to coordinate
    such an effort."

  body: "You talk about embedding a font in your appli(cation) - so do you plan on
    redistributing the universal font with your Mac based application? The cost of
    licensing one of the existing fonts or a custom font for redistribution would
    be expensive, and you're probabyl better off writing code that uses a preferred
    system font for each language. \r\n\r\nSome platforms have that built in - for
    example WPF has the concept of a composite font, an XML file that points to different
    fonts for each Unicode range and language ID.  \r\n"

    you said about the licensing  I didn't really get it, you mean that if I use a

  body: "I know it's your choice, but please, please, please don't use MS Arial Unicode
    for Korean if you have any consideration at all for respectful typography.\r\n\r\nThe
    Korean portion of MS Arial Unicode is downright distracting in its ugliness and
    complete disregard of the Korean feel for letterform proportions. It looks so
    amazingly amateurish even to Koreans untrained in typography. I sincerely wish
    it didn't exist at all.\r\n\r\nThat was my whole point. Yes, there are fonts that
    provide glyphs for all those different writing systems, but they won't all be
    usable. Please don't sacrifice typographic sensitivity for the apparent simplicity
    of using a single font. You will regret it if you actually want people to read
    all the different scripts you set in that font."
