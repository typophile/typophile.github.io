body: 'Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to identify the font in the following
  images.  The images are from a set of logs on our website and on our company cards.  they
  were designed by a local graphics design company which went out of business several
  years ago and their graphic design staff have &#40;as far as we can discern&#41;
  left the country so we are unable to simply ask the designers what it is! <BR> <BR>I
  have been using any online ID tools i can find in my attempts to ID this font and
  most recently Mike Yanega of Bowfin Printworks&#39; ID tool.  He suggested i post
  here as he is sure you people will be able to cast your experienced eyes over it
  and say what it is. I&#39;m hoping, nay preying, he&#39;s right. <BR> <BR>Push comes
  to shove i&#39;m prepared to sit down with what i&#39;ve got, download a font authoring
  tool and over the weekend emerse myself in redesigning the font type from scratch
  if necessary so any help with that would also be good. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve setup this
  account with my work address but if you have a 100% sure ID on the font you can
  email me at home over the weekend &#40;it&#39;s friday afternoon here now&#41; at
