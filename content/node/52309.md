  body: "@Renko Thanks for your prompt reply.\r\n\r\nThe new font is not Erik Spiekerman's
    work, although he creates the famous Nokia Sans. Nor is it based on Siemens croporate
    typeface. I Googled over the web, and found that Moving Brands, a newly emerging
    design firm based in Lodon helped making the new logo for the the new emerged
    company in 2007. There is also an animation verson of the logo. Pretty impressive.
    \r\nBut I still have no idea what exactly the typeface is. The font looks like
    a customization based on Neo Sans and Frutiger. Any thoughts?"

    appear softer, but the makeup of the t appears extremely similar. "

    a copy of it, but I've misplaced it.
