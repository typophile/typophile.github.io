body: Does anyone know if Lucida Grande (which resembles Helvetica Standard) comes
  in a rounded version? I desperately need Lucida Grande Round because the periods
  are looking like square boxes with the Lucida Grande. I can't have those square
  periods. I've built a video around Lucida Grande and will have to change everything
  because of these periods. Please can anyone help me find the rounded version of
  Lucida Grande or suggest some substitutes that hopefully won't mess up my video
  presentation? Thank you.

    Can't you just select a different font for the periods? There are probably thousands
    of humanist sans serifs with round(er) dots.

    to make if the EULA allows it. You can contact Apple and ask about it, or if perhaps
    they themselves can modify Lucida Grande to fit your needs.'

  body: Like Frode said, can't you just replace the periods with a different font?
    Don't replace the other characters. :-)

    i's, colons, semi-colons, exclamation points, j's, etc. I don't have the time
    for that, but guess I'll have to do it, anyway.\r\nWhat I get is there is no version
    of Lucida Grande Rounded? \r\nThank you for your comments."
