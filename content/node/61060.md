  of distressed fonts but none quite like this which I have seen on more than one
  occasion so think it is not a custom face...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Text_sample_3594.jpg]\r\nThis
  is driving me mad so any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking
  the time to look - Zaphodz"
