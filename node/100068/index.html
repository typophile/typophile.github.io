  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles, its been a while since I have posted on here.

This is the first time I have seriously tried to design a font, I'm 20 and a student, previously I have flirted half-heartedly or edited existing faces. So I would really appreciate some feedback (please be gentle, this is my first time at the rodeo).

The working title for this font is Lombard, but I have a feeling I am going to change it. I was inspired by a pair of unique street signs in my home town of Wellington, but through further development I found myself looking at the type used in the Tintin magazines of my childhood. I can also definitively say Colophone's incredible [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/raisonne/about-font|Raisonne]] and [[http://www.grillitype.com|Grilli Type's entire catalogue]] were guiding hands as to the boundaries between feature and distraction.

I am placing this post in the Display section, for obvious reasons. I position this as an interesting alternative to the many condensed slabs that people use perhaps a little too often these days.

Overall I'm quite happy with the result, but I know that there is a fair amount of work left to do; small caps, a lighter weight and perhaps an outlined version is in order I think.

Please let me know what you think, dying to hear.

At first glance the font didn't  impress me, but the more I looked at it the more I liked it. I like that the K is so much wider than the R and P, and that the bottom of the R sticks out further than the top. I think that is what gives it it's quiet and simple charm. My only problem is the W, every time I read through your samples it stops me, it just seems to heavy. I don't know how to solve it, lucky for me that is the designers job.

I wish my first font would have turned out this nice. I would really love to see the finished version.</div>
