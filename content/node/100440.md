body: "I've asked this question over on the OpenType and mpeg lists, but I thought
  some of you might have longer memories.\r\n\r\nThe current OpenType spec says, in
  the 'post' fmt 2.0 table, that:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n     Index numbers 32768 through
  65535 are reserved for future use.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any
  recollection of why this limit is present -- or what possible \"future use\" such
  name ids might be put to?\r\n\r\nAnd I guess more practically, can anyone suggest
  a reason not to eliminate this restriction?\r\n\r\ntia,\r\n\r\nBob"

    to try to write OpenType and Graphite rules without human-friendly glyph identifiers,
    and for this the PS names are extremely helpful."

  body: "I'm generally of the opinion that the identifiers used in development tools
    needn't be the same as or limited by any of the requirements of the post table
    (or of Adobe's naming recommendations). If tools are going to offer to write development
    names to a post table, then they should flag any that are too long or otherwise
    contravene particular specifications.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't see any reason
    why this restriction in the post table spec shouldn't be removed. As I understand
    from Apple, it was originally made because of some ancient software that is no
    longer relevant."
