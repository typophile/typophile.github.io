  organisation called FDU. I'm trying to do something 70s-ish, with a modern feel.
  I guess Bello by Underware is somewhat similar to my goal. It's not good yet, I
  know. This is my first go at a handwritten script ever. If you have a minute, please
  give your opinion."

  body: "It looks beautiful; the curves don't quite work yet but I don't think that's
    the main problem. To be honest, I could absolutely not read it until I read your
    explanation, and even knowing what letters are supposed to be there, it's really
    hard. I see FJa, or maybe FSa or FHl or FHe, but mostly just a nice scripty \"thing\"
    (sorry). The d is not a d, and the u looks like it wants to be an a or maybe an
    o or a couple of e's or something.\r\n\r\nAlso, have you checked if an \"Fdu\"
    (instead of \"FDU\") treatment may be confusing?\r\n\r\nFWIW, your letters reminded
    me just a bit of <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-72-pivo\">Pivo</a>
    \u2013 might be worth checking out."

    drawing the letters individually and then working them together with loose or

    Gotta figure out a way to connect the letters and still keep it readable.

  body: Script and all-caps is a recipe for difficulty. Would you be better off dropping
    the script idea - or, dropping the caps idea (FDU -> fdu)?
