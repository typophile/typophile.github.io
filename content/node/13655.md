body: Designed by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] for [[Megenthaler Linotype]] under
  the direction of [[C. H. Griffith]] starting 7/19/39 through 2/6/41. These typeface
  [[fleurons]] were inspired by Dwiggins' work with stencils and stencil artwork.
  One can clearly see some of the same shapes and curves in the design of his marionettes.
