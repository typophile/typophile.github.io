  Wentworth Thompsons \"On Growth and Form\"?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIn combination with
  the strict page cramming layout of the book this font adds an airiness that makes
  this dense text look and be fluently readable.\r\n\r\nI guess it's a classic, but
  what is the name of this font?"

  body: "Yes, Computer Modern looks very close. I remember that I really liked the
    font of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX|LaTeX]], and that was Computer Modern!
    Actually I think that I'll go for a LaTeX-trip when I write this essay ...\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments!"
