    apartheid and genocide on a smaller nation they completely control and have lead
    a brutal 45 year occupation of.  Israel has dropped 250+ bombs on this country
    in the past week alone, all unprovoked.  They are trying to systematically destroy
    a population of people, saying they have no choice, when in reality they control
    Gaza right down to the quality of their drinking water, which per them has been
    reduced down to only 5% safe for human consumption.  Israel controls where people
    are allowed to live in Gaza, continually taking more and more of the land for
    their own, and does not recognize any political party that may form democratically
    there.  The relationship Israel has with Gaza is the same as the US government
    has with the Native American reservations.  I doubt if any of you would rush to
    defend the US if they started dropping bombs on the Native American reservations.
    \ Yes, 2012 Israel = Nazi era Germany.  They are committing an atrocity.\r\n\r\nI
    have changed all my profile pics on all the networks I belong to to this picture

    sure is not a member of this forum.\r\n\r\nThis is all I have to say on the matter.
    I have no desire to change typophile into a political forum, however it seems
    that others here want exactly that.  This was supposed to be a thread about marketing
    fonts.  Who changed it into something else? Not me.  I have made no ranting political
    statements about this here other than this post, and I will not make anymore in

    have nothing more to say on the matter and will not respond to anyone who wants
    to press the issue further.\r\n\r\nSo, anyone want to actually answer my question?"

  body: "Ryan, you have no idea what you are writing about, which is a very complicated
    and tragic situation. Within hours after Israel voluntarily withdrew from the
    Gaza strip in Sept 2005 some within Gaza started shelling Israel, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rocket_and_mortar_attacks_in_Israel_in_2001_through_2006|as
    noted here in a Wikipedia article]]. If they were interested in further withdrawal
    from the West Bank, this would make no sense, as it is not exactly designed to
    encourage Israel to continue withdrawal from territories beyond the '67 borders.
    \r\n\r\nHowever the continual shelling of Israel by the Hamas-led government (which
    took over by violence) is understandable given [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Charter|the
    Hamas Charter]], which explicitly adopts the goal of eliminating the Jewish state,
    and is full of hatred for Jews, not just Israelis\u2014and has not been renounced
    by current Hamas leaders. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel|Gaza
    has continually shelled Israel since]] Israel left in 2005, leading to the 2008
    invasion by Israel and second withdrawal, and then relative quiet for several
    years. But there has been [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel#2012|escalation
    recently]]. A country being continuously shelled by another is intolerable, and
    Israel fighting back against those who have declared war against them and are
    continually attacking them is understandable. If some Mexicans were shelling Texas
    regularly, I think we would less see restraint on the part of the US. \r\n\r\nThe
    situation in Gaza is also intolerable, partly due to Israel's blockade, and I
    am sure Israel has also done bad things. In any case, it is disgusting and horrible
    that people are dying on both sides, and right now many more on the side of Gaza.
    But the fact is that Israel is not conducting a genocidal war. If they wanted
    to do that, they could, and millions would die, but that isn't what is happening.
    It would also be insane and evil, but that is another matter.  \r\n\r\nI am also
    not saying that the Netanyahu government is right to attack now. I am too far
    from the situation and know too little to have any wisdom about who does exactly
    what when. Also personally I distrust Netanyahu. \r\n\r\nBut I would say this:
    \ Hamas from its beginning declared war against Israel, and has prosecuted that
    war in an ineffectual but terrorizing way for many years. When Israel fights back
    trying to stop the rockets, and with some restraint but also a lot of horror and
    death, I think it rings hollow to complain about one-sided aggression. Hamas has
    asked for war by their continual attacks, and now they've got it, for the second
    time. Because of this background both the US <em>and European</em> governments
    have not been condemning Israel, though both have called for a cease-fire, which
    I devoutly wish happens soon.  \r\n\r\nI will leave it to more knowledgeable people
    to write the story of this battle, and to sort out the rights and wrongs, which
    I assure you are not just on one side. And I understand the fury of those on both
    sides who are losing and may lose friends and relatives, and their own lives.
    But please don't spout off from a distance when you have no idea of the situation."

    That includes Jews, Arabs, and Muslims. If you overlay the New York area with
    a circle equal to the territory of Israel, you will include 80% or so as many
    Jews as in Israel, but nobody is killing anybody else in ethnic wars. The source
    of the war is intolerance, not immigration. Had not people like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini|Haj
    Amin al-Husseini]] demagogically whipped up hatred, but instead tolerant and democratic
    processes had been followed, you would have the same thing in the Middle East.
    There would be an Arab led Palestine with a substantial Jewish minority all working
    together, prosperous and at peace. \r\n\r\nThe Hamas war on Israel is part of
    being led by hatred, rather than cooperation and peace. If Hamas stops bombing,
    then building trust and cooperation can move forward. I'm not saying that it will
    be easy, because Israelis are traumatized by over 60 years of attacks, and are
    full of mistrust and in some cases hatred, as are Palestinian Arabs. But the path
    of war is a path to devastation and misery. Simply looking at the conflict as
    a question of who is the good guy and who is the bad guy, as you have done, is
    a symptom of an approach that leads to more conflict, misery and devastation.

    February 2009 \u2014 just after the Operation Cast Lead onslaught \u2014 and August
    2012, Israeli attacks in Gaza, averaging six per week. They came by aircraft,
    helicopter gunships, drones, and tanks throughout Gaza; the confiscation of, or
    damage to, fishing boats and the detention and arrest of fishermen; attacks on
    industrial, farm, and food production facilities; and military ground incursions.\r\n\r\nThe
    current crisis is framed in terms devoid of any real context. The issue goes far
    beyond which side precipitated the terrible violence that has killed innocents
    on both sides. The issue \u2014 largely forgotten \u2014 is one of continued occupation
    and blockade, a grossly asymmetrical conflict that has deliberately and systematically
    disabled Gaza\u2019s economy and people.\r\n\r\nThe Gaza Strip is now in its 46th
    year of occupation, 22nd year of closure, and sixth year of intensified closure.
    The resulting normalization of the occupation assumes a dangerous form in the
    Gaza Strip, whose status as an occupied territory has ceased to matter in the
    West; the attention has shifted \u2014 after Hamas\u2019s 2006 electoral victory
    and 2007 takeover of the territory \u2014 to Gaza\u2019s containment and punishment,
    rendering illegitimate any notion of human rights or freedom for Palestinians.\r\n\r\nThe
    Israeli government has referred to its siege policy as a form of \u201Ceconomic
    warfare.\u201D In a Nov. 2008 cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv released by
    WikiLeaks, US officials wrote, \u201CAs part of their overall embargo plan against
    Gaza, Israeli officials have confirmed . . . on multiple occasions that they intend
    to keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse without quite pushing it over
    the edge\u201D with the aim of having Gaza\u2019s economy \u201Cfunctioning at
    the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis.\u201D
    This was achieved through an Israeli-imposed blockade that ended all normal trade.\r\n\r\nThe
    result has been high and persistent unemployment, which stood near 30 percent
    by June 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund. Approximately 39 percent
    of Gaza\u2019s people lived below the poverty line in 2011. The figure would be
    far greater without donor aid.\r\n\r\nGaza\u2019s economic decline is seen in
    the near collapse of its agricultural sector. One factor is the destruction of
    around 7,800 acres of agricultural land during Cast Lead. Consequently, approximately
    one-third of Gaza\u2019s total arable land is out of production. Furthermore,
    Israeli-imposed buffer zones \u2014 areas of restricted access \u2014 now absorb
    nearly 14 percent of Gaza\u2019s total land and at least 48 percent of total arable
    land.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the sea buffer zone covers 85 percent of the maritime
    area promised to Palestinians in the Oslo Accords, reducing 20 nautical miles
    to three, where waters are fouled by sewage flows in excess of 23 million gallons
    daily.\r\n\r\nAnother critical constraint is water. Gaza\u2019s aquifer has been
    ruined by prolonged over-pumping and sewage and contaminant infiltration.\r\n\r\nAlmost
    all of Gaza\u2019s municipal wells used for drinking water are seriously polluted.
    Due to the breakdown of Gaza\u2019s sanitation infrastructure, particularly after
    2008, this infiltration has led to elevated levels of nitrates and chlorides in
    the groundwater and soil \u2014 far above World Health Organization safety levels
    \u2014 posing a dangerous health risk to humans and livestock.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u2019s
    blockade policy restricts the entry of materials needed to repair, maintain, and
    upgrade Gaza\u2019s sewage and wastewater treatment infrastructure. Save the Children
    reported in 2011 that Israeli airstrikes destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure
    valued at $1.3 million.\r\n\r\nThe impact on health is clear: Just under 10 percent
    of Gazan children under five suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2010. According
    to Save the Children, \u201CDiseases of poverty and conflict combined with a degenerating
    health care system are claiming growing numbers of Gaza\u2019s children.\u201D\r\n\r\nBirth
    defects, congenital anomalies, and cancer cases are reportedly rising. This is
    likely due to environmental contamination, including the possible use of toxic
    weaponry during Cast Lead. The current military assault will undoubtedly worsen
    environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nYet the US government will probably cut funding
    to the Palestinians if they pursue United Nations observer membership.\r\n\r\nPolitical
    differences aside, where is our humanity?\r\n"

  body: "@Ryan Maelhorn:\r\n<cite>Israel has dropped 250+ bombs on this country in
    the past week alone, all unprovoked.</cite>\r\n\r\nSince your post was dated November
    17, 2012, the fact that the attacks by Israel on the Gaza strip that are taking
    place <em>this</em> week were not unprovoked, but were in response to missiles
    being launched at Israel is not directly relevant.\r\n\r\nHowever, even without
    going to Wikipedia, I see by other posts in this thread that shelling and rockets
    from Hamas were taking place then too. I would like to see the blockade of Gaza
    end, but it won't end if it's obvious that will just give Hamas the opportunity
    to more easily bring in better rockets in order to accomplish its goal of driving
    Israel into the sea.\r\n\r\nHamas, not Israel, is the obstacle to a normal life
    for the Palestinian people. Naturally, though, it's going to be difficult to make
    many of the Palestinian people understand that so that they can take their place
    as responsible, peaceful world citizens, living peacefully in their own country
    beside Israel and not attacking it the same way that the people of Finland live
    peacefully in their own country without shooting missiles at Russia or Germany
    or wherever.\r\n\r\nAnd what is also shocking is that these attacks are taking
    place <em>after</em> September 11, 2001. After terrorism had been exposed as utterly
    evil depravity, after the world has demanded zero tolerance for terrorism henceforth."
