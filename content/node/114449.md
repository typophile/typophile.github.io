  best quick auto-hinting solution, right now I know 4 (quick) options:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  No Hinting\r\n\u2022 Fontlab Hinting (with proper stems/blue zones)\r\n\u2022 FontSquirrel\r\n\u2022
  TTFautohint Program (thanks to Dave Crossland)\r\n\r\n(I've attached the results)
  The question is:\r\nDo you know any other quick auto-hinting options that might
  be worth a try?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<em>*I'm using Chrome on Windows 8.1, and
  the tests with Impallari testing tool</em>"

  body: The Fontlab autohinting screenshot looks like PostScript outlines rendering.
    If you are looking for meaningful results, it's better to only compare fonts with
    the same outline type.

    but you are right!\r\nYes Jens, I should have done TTF tests only! :/\r\n\r\nWill
