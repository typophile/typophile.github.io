  body: The shapes of the letters are exactly the same as those in ITC Aki Lines,
    except it's solid instead of made up from parallel lines (similar to Prisma, but
    going thick to thin). For better or worse, ITC Aki Lines has yet to be digitized.
    I can find no evidence that there was a released version that was filled in like
    this, so it was probably some sort of modification.
