  body: None of your posts feature 'fonts'. They are all hand carved, nor are they

  body: "Most interesting thing about the lettering is the swoosh leg on _R_. In digital
    form this is found on a serifed font called Vulpa [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vulpa_R_6215.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/vulpa/\r\nThe sans lettering has some
    similarity to the thick and thin style that appeared in some fonts from circa
    1900, including Globe Gothic http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-globe-gothic/\r\nDon"
