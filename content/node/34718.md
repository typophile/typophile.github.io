body: "Hello, I'm a new individual font designer. I'm creating new writing systems,
  new \"alphabets\" if you will, and want to create an easy to use font that will
  allow people to write with those new alphabets by simply installing the font on
  their computer. \r\n\r\nHere's what happened, I drew the glyphs in Adobe Illustrator
  CS2, and I need to draw them in that software and not in a font-editing/making software
  because the glyphs in question have to be very accurate and well-drawn which would
  take forever using the limited tools in font-creating software. So I drew them in
  Illustrator, but when I try to import them into Font Creator 5 or Fontographer 4.1,
  they distort the vector art or rasterize it. I tried everything, importing it as
  EPS in Fontographer (but it causes the program to crash)...\r\n\r\nHow can I import
  or copy-paste a vector drawing/glyph into a font creating program without it distorting
  the vector art? What font program should I use? Should I get Font Creator Pro or
  maybe something else? Is there a free font editing program that can do this? \r\n\r\nThank
  you very much in advance guys. "

  body: "Fontographer could always easily import Illustrator files as long as they
    were measured correctly, each letter being the same height. A good easy intro
    on how to do this is <a href=\"http://www.chank.com/howto/index.php\">here</a>
    Chank was one of the original guys who introduced fonts to the Internet world
    and is still working. There are of course many other places to look for info.
    If I were you I would, if you haven't already, download from FontLab the manuals
    and or demo programs for Fontographer or FontLab or better yet, for the beginner,
    TypeTool 3, also from FontLab, an inexpensive yet very powerful program. Without
    seeing an example of the font you are attempting to create it is difficult to
    understand where the problem is but I suspect that the outlines of the glyphs
    are very complex, which can cause problems. If you can, put up a gif or pdf file
    of the work you are doing so readers can get an idea of what is going on. Not
    familiar with Font Creator 5. And given the tools available in the font creation
    programs I use, TypeTool 3, Fontog, FontLab Studio I don't see why you couldn't
    create the fonts directly in those programs. But for clarity the contributors
    to Typophle probably need to see something. \r\nGood luck\r\nJordan"

    :) I assume you don't mean \"numerically\"... what do you mean exactly?\r\n\r\nTo
    the OP: \"VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE HELP!!\" is a really really bad subject line for
    a post. You'll get a better response if you summarise what you are really asking.
    I can't speak for others, but I don't normally read any post that doesn't give
    a clue to itself in the subject line (it's almost always a waste of time, obviously)."

  body: Ah OK. I recently re-read the <a href="/node/33531">thread</a> on Raph's prototype
    Cornu editor (weird, searching for 'cornu' does not find anything). Is anyone
    doing anything with it?

  body: "Here it is, handwritten. If you see it on its actual size, it's very well-written
    but the zoom magnifies the inevitable errors made during handwriting. Needless
    to say, as a font it needs to be 100% accurate. This is even more the case when
    the writing system has it's letters/glyphs connected to each other. \r\n\r\nhttp://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f112/Elenalkarnur/quenyalen.png\r\n\r\nI
    have found on the Fontlab Studio page that it supports importing Illustrator data
    (.ai and .eps), I have tried the demo version: the import worked succesfully.
    I am currently downloading Fontlab Studio retail. "

    like you found the answer as far as software is concerned.
