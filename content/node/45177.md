    same question to you with the Dell, about colour, and have you ever thought the
    ultra sharp was artificially over-sharp? yes no?\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: "Whenever this stuff gets discussed on the InDesign mailing list, there seems
    to be a general consensus that the Dell UltraSharp line has outstanding quality
    at a decent price. At least until recently Dell and Apple used the same suppliers,
    so you were getting largely the \"same\" monitor for a big price differential
    - I assume that's still true, but haven't heard on that point lately.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I don't want to buy an external monitor whose resolution isn't at least equal
    to my laptop's built-in screen, so currently that's 1920x1200, which is what the
    particular Dell linked above has. But for now I'll stick to my old 1600x1200 CRT
    monitor. It works well enough I can't justify spending the money to replace it,
    even though a higher-res LCD screen would be HOTT.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks Paul. Cartoonish is right. Plus, what a lot of work outlined in the
    threads. Compared to plugging in an apple display. yikes. \r\n\r\nI brought my
    laptop to Future Shop yesterday and hooked it up, calibrated it as best I could,
    it was still over-saturated. It wasn't an Ultra Sharp, but I don't know about
    the Dell idea. Maybe you do get what you pay for, and after working on cinema
    displays this long, maybe I'll always be bugged by the differences. :(\r\n\r\nthanks
    everyone.\r\n\r\n"

  body: yep, you do. this isn't a mac-pc thing, lets not go there. its more a matter
    of where I can get respectable equipment around here that isn't apple. since that
    isn't a type thing, I'll figure it out. :)

    ish its a pretty fair price.?\r\n\r\nive not come across anything as - plug and
    play for sharpness and colour.\r\n\r\nbut i'd avoid the 20\" version - we have
    a couple in the studio and compared to the 23's they are like working in a grubby

    inch Samsung monitor. When using InDesign I have plenty of room for workspace
    and room for all the tools and preference windows. The two monitors work well
    together.
