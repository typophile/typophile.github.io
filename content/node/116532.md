  looking for the font used for the W and also the text at the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_4951.JPG]"

    I know combining both slab (/W) and sans serif (rest) in a single family with
    many variations in weight and width. BTW, the four upper terminals /W could easily
    be reconstructed with 2 overlapped /V.\r\nMore alternatives: http://typophile.com/node/107362,
