  body: "Thanks and happy new year.\r\n\r\nStationer:\r\n\r\nThe original, old fashioned
    \"stationer\" goes back before the incunabula, I believe; these were middlemen
    who sold and controlled the binding of manuscripts into books for sale. \"In 1403,
    the Corporation of London approved the formation of a Guild of stationers. At
    this time, stationers were either booksellers, illuminators, or bookbinders[1].
    Booksellers sold manuscript books that they or their employees had copied. They
    also sold the writing materials that they used. Illuminators illustrated and decorated
    manuscripts.\r\n\r\nPrinting gradually displaced manuscript production and, by
    the time that the Guild received a royal charter of incorporation on May 4, 1557...\"\u2014http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers\r\n\r\nMore
    recently (1830-ish, rise of the middle class, industrial revolution and invention
    of department stores, window displays and marketing devices such as pre-packaged
    sets of stuffs like paper with envelopes) the old fashioned stationer was to whom
    the public would go for writing equipment (paper, pens, tablets, stationery, blank
    books, paper what-nots and household needs such as paper clips\u2014when people
    still actively used such things.) As printing technology became easier to operate
    and more and more affordable, stationery shops (store front affairs) invested
    in little letterpress and engraving set-ups to better serve a growing clientele
    and hold on to more of the purchase price for their wares and services. \r\n\r\nThe
    stationer is also to whom one goes to help conform with local social etiquette
    (such as the correct calling card, birth announcement, wedding invitation, condolence
    card, change of address announcement; kind of a one stop shop for printed matters
    pertaining to getting along with the neighbors.)\r\n\r\nSince digital technology
    has supplanted this lovely, and nostalgic old trade, there has been a major resurgence
    in new small shop set-ups, primarily with young designers."
