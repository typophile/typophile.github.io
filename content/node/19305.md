    a free font, but you could go over to www.typedifferent.com to see if there's
    anything similar."

  body: I thought "Alert" might be either DustBust or Identikal, but I couldn't find
    it (yet). Seen it before though.

    at dafont.com has a similar feel to \"alert\", but it aint the same.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I just noticed that dafont.com has 45 pages of \"Techno>Various\"\r\n\r\nI think
    I'll quit now"

    to me to keep a font that looked like that.

    didn't find it, thank you for reminding me, the job is getting closer. I shall
    probably re-draw it.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was Charter Oak, but that's much
    nicer. Judging by the delightful counters in the R and B, whatever it was has
    been skewd and reverse squooshed\u2122 to within an inch of it's life.\r\n\r\nOn
    second thoughts, I'll see if I can break Handel!\r\n\r\nRichard"
