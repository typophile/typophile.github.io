body: "   Back to the research, I looked at various graphic designers like Paul Rand,
  Milton Glaser, Walter Landor and Charmayoff & Geismar amongst other designers. These
  were all quiet inspirational to my ideas generation, especially Paul Rand's logo
  designs. Rand's logos were just in a class of there own when it came to simplicity
  and style. Yeah, I've seen them all before from previous research finds, but every
  time I look at them they still look timeless and amaze me how well they explain
  the brand.\r\n   [tbc]"
