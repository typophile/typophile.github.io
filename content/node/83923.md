  his animated gifs. Originally I thought it was something straightforward like a
  Futura or Avant Garde, but the \"a\" doesn't match up on either of those so I'm
  stumped. Any help would be appreciated."

  body: "It depends on what fonts you have installed.\r\n\r\nLooks like it will prefer
    Futura, Century Gothic and Apple Gothic, according to the HTML I'm seeing.  As
    to the A, there are a few different types of Futura, with some having a pointed
    A and others having a truncated one."

  body: Andrew, he is asking specifically about the fonts on animated gifs, not the
    website's css font-stack.

    are on the page.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle font is not Futura or Avant Garde or a geometric
    face.  It appears to be a humanist face."
