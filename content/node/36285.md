body: "Hello,\r\nI've searched and found a couple of posts of people asking for help
  on this topic, but nothing exactly related to decorative ends. I help people put
  decorative one-line phrases and quotes above their windows, doors, etc. Everyone
  asks me for help about the size the ornaments need to be in relation to the text.
  Does anyone have any general guidelines?\r\n\r\nI have a couple of examples that
  I would like to be critiqued below...how are the size and placement of the decorative
  ends in relation to the text?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peace-to-this-house_foyer_5775.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/now-and-forever_window_6100.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Laissez-les-bons-temps-roulez_Family-room_6337.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance,\r\nylenyon\r\n \r\nP.S. I'm also looking for someone willing to consult
  with my company on this topic, so if you do such work, please let me know. thx"
