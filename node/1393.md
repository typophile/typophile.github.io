  font the Tarantino film Jackie Brown headline is in? It&#39;s a straight lift from
  the original poster for the 1970&#39;s blaxploitation flic &#34;Foxy Brown&#34;
  I&#39;ve got a feeling I should know this... it looks like its based on a Lubalin
  face... anybody up on their 70s retro? <BR>cheers <BR>andrew <BR><a href="http://www.crocodilejock.com"
