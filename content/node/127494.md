  body: "Indeed, the image traces back to FontFont's in-use page for Parango: https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/parango/in-use
    \r\nThank you for that. \r\nImages showing the title face, however, only exhibit
    the following caption: Y. Perrousseaux\r\nMaybe the images were posted by http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-45756.html
    ?\r\nSadly that's as far as I've been able to get. A pity, too.. it's a perfect
    match for a project I'm working on.\r\n\r\n"

    searches, and came up empty.\r\n\r\nThe late Yves Perrousseaux was the founder
    of Atelier Perrousseaux, a publisher of design-related (not cook) books. He likely
    contributed the images, but he doesn\u2019t appear to be the publisher of the
    source material.\r\n\r\nThe style of lettering is Carolingian:\r\nhttp://www.designhistory.org/Handwriting_pages/Carolingian.html\r\n\r\nWhat
    you posted is likely custom or from a very small foundry or solo type designer...."
