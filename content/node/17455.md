  body: "The mark looks haphazardly put together. The sloppy curves of the \"papers\"
    really distract from a potentially good mark. It has potential as I see what you
    were getting to, but work on simplifying the mark, taking the balance of the strokes
    and how they look together into consideration. Also, consider the role of positive
    to negative space play together. These paper overlap each other and create minor
    distracting negative spaces. \r\n\r\nI think you should sharpen that up first,
    then resubmit it for review. The forum functions much better when everyone thinks
    you put some effort into it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I agree that this has potential. I think the way you're portraying the paper
    now looks more like waves than paper though. Maybe you can try some different
    angles, or show a bit of the surface of the paper, and not just the end to give
    it more form? Keep working on it...

  body: "I agree with Chris and blackbirdsings, it's a good start but needs work.\r\n\r\nKeep
    refining the paper. It doesn't read as paper. Maybe that is not important, and
    it is just supposed to look interesting and abstract, but the paper crosses over
    itself, which makes the design confusing. Paper cannot pass through itself like
    that. It looks more like wood or metal shavings than paper. Also, the books use
    the flat side of the paper sheets, not the edges, so that adds to the confusion.\r\n\r\nKeep
    playing with the paper design. You've got an interesting start."

  body: Try taking the paper out of the box and try to make it curl like a lower case
    e. Try another face for Editura, it looks to stiff and unflexible. Your not making
    boxes or some other product you are publishing. Loosen up the design

  body: "With the last two that you posted the \"upright\" of the edge of the paper
    is conflicting with the e-ness of your icon, I think that the version with the
    lowercase editura where the righthand upright is not quite connecting works better,
    might be worth trying to move the upright on the left down slightly away from
    the e. I also like the look of your first post where the bottom of the box was
    implied.\r\nTim"

  body: "I know you don't want to be too literal, but that is one thick piece of paper!
    I think the you need to bring down the contrast between the thick and thin parts
    of your \"e\". Also, the perspective is too severe. You are forcing the viewer
    to imagine a rolled up piece of paper held from something like a 60 degree angle
    above their head and then read the text at no angle. It's not harmonious.\r\n\r\nGet
    some tape and roll up a piece of paper into the shape of an e. Take some digital
    pictures at different angles and then use them as references while you sketch.
    For instance, I see a lowercase e with horizontal lines flowing left.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Gil Sans feels to cold and corporate compared to the style of drawing you have
    shown. A nice serif would probably serve the mark better."
