  body: Basically, bigger fonts create a bigger emotional response that can be measured
    by scanning someone's brain.

    something getting bigger (i.e. closer). So if you really want to leave a strong
    impression take a logo of any size and smack it on their face.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    instance, be one reason why headlines written in big letters are popular and evidently
    successful in the yellow press media.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nOr vice versa.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    how art directors, graphic designers and typographers invest display type with
    \u201Caesthetic\u201D tonality or para-textual meaning, and consequently how it\u2019s
    read. One is accustomed to respond to a title or headline with a value judgement
    (emotionally-driven), namely, whether one should continue with the document and
    dive into the body text.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201Cyellow press\u201D phenomenon,
    but deeply embedded in the culture:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lindisfarne-big_3597.jpg]"

    it is in contrast to typical broadsheet typography. GOTCHA!"
