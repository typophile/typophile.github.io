  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am designing italics to fit with a roman, and I am having trouble knowing where to place the glyphs so that the word space looks right either side of a bit of italics in line with roman.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a slanted rectangle glyph, as tall as the x height. If I set the sidebearings such that the baseline part of the glyph is central in the set width, then this glyph will look displaced to the right relative to upright glyphs, due to the rightward slant. So I offset the glyph to the left, such that the top sticks out to the right as much as the bottom sticks out to the left. I can then apply the same offset to all glyphs. The problem is, this simple formula does not work for all glyphs. For example, italic capitals can be modelled as a slanted rectangle as tall as the cap height, so these need more offset than the x height rectangle. Ascenders and descenders in the lower case have a similar effect, I think. Since the italics must be correctly spaced within themselves, the same offset must be applied to all italic glyphs, so a compromise of some kind is needed.</p>
<p>Is there some standard formula for working out the offset from the italic angle and the vertical proportions (x height, ascender, cap height, etc), or is there some recommended test to help adjust the offset by eye?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Tiffany. I followed that thread when it was first introduced, and it does indeed contain a great deal of useful technical stuff about optical corrections required when creating obliqued shapes, with a good sprinkling of debate about whether italics should adopt a cursive style compared to the roman, and so on.</p>
<p>That said, I have just re-read all the comments, and the particular problem I am looking at now did not appear to be addressed. I am just thinking that this is another one of those &lsquo;gotchas&rsquo; that type design appears to be full of, and that, given the long history of type design, it was no doubt sorted out centuries ago by someone far more clever than I am.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I&rsquo;ve always done is to shift the italic left so that the point midway between the baseline and the x-height of the roman and italic align, like this:

_________________ x-height

&hellip;..|./
&hellip;..|/
&hellip;..|
&hellip;./|

<p>There&rsquo;s really no way to make every combination between roman and italic fit perfectly. Lowercase-to-lowercase would seem to be the most common situation, so that&rsquo;s why I do it this way.</p>
<p>Punctuation is not really a problem except in a situation where you have roman followed by italic punctuation in which case the punctuation will be a bit too close. The reverse situation is probably more common&ndash;italic followed by roman punctuation. In that case, the punctuation will be spaced a little loose, which I think is okay. In any case, the rule I learned years ago about typesetting is that, with rare exceptions, punctuation should match the style that precedes it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Since the beginning of my experience, I&rsquo;ve been taught to center the italic H with about the same interserif spacing as the Roman, and then offset the italic l.c.

There is another theory that I&rsquo;m in the midst of debunking where you center the italic l.c. and space the caps where they fall, but this does not always work, resulting in a l.c. that&rsquo;s too far to the right amongst Roman and letter(s) with extreme right kerns falling into stuff.</div>

<p>The interserif space (i.e. the space between the serifs of two adjacent H&rsquo;s), should be about the same, or slightly less than the Roman&hellip;if there are no serifs, well, then the space between italic H&rsquo;s should be slightly less than the roman space between H&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;re two things: getting the basic H space, (and n space), fromRoman to Italic, and determining how and which way to offset either the upper, or lowercase, or both. I space the Uppers as I&rsquo;ve described, and offset the lowers to the left&hellip;</p>
<p>The fundamental principle is rooted in the following: you really do want to center the Roman by itself, don&rsquo;t you?, you really cannot effectively offset into the word space, can you, and you can&rsquo;t control any interfont spacing, thus: if the italic caps are not centered between romans, they never will be&hellip;and that is the basic need because the l.c. can only look bad if too far right&hellip;and this you can see a lot of these daze.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, David. Am I right in thinking that the interserif space idea refers to letter spacing within the italics, to make the italic letter spacing match that of the roman? That is another problem from the italic offset, I think, though it is also interesting, as the different lower case serif shapes and placements in roman and italics give rise to different spacings to the main stems, and it is typically only in the capitals that the serifs are the same in italic and roman.</p>
<p>Looking at the offset point, I gather that you would place the alignment line (as shown in John&rsquo;s attachment) at half of the cap height, so an italic &lsquo;H&rsquo; would be centered between two roman &lsquo;Hs&rsquo;. Your alignment line is therefore higher than that suggested by Mark, Thomas, and John, which is a bit above half the x height. I would have thought that lower case words and phrases embedded in roman sentences (the most common case?) would look displaced too far to the left with your choice of offset.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Glyn, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve translated the &lsquo;Berlownese,&rsquo; as John Hudson calls it, correctly. The italic H will have the same or slightly less space between the serifs&ndash;and stems, as these are the same shape on both sides of the H. The italic H should also be centered between the side bearings, if I understand him correctly. But the n will be offset to the left of center between its side bearings in order to center between two H&rsquo;s. This will put the n somewhere in the neighborhood of where Mark and John will put it according to their rules. But it may be different from font to font, according to the design.</p>
<p>The rest of the italics may be spaced relative to the italic H and n. Did I get it right, David?</p>
<p>p.s. Just testing with an italic I am working on now, David&rsquo;s method made the side bearings of the italic n equal with the guideline at 63% of the x-height&ndash;about the same as Thomas&rsquo;s method, for this particular design, anyway</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I hadn&rsquo;t before considered the roman-italic spacing question in the terms David suggests, but I can see the sense in beginning with spacing the italic H so that it centres between roman Hs. As David says, if you use any other approach, the italic H will always be offset to the left or right (unless the design happens to have very short caps, in which case one might get close to a centered H following my recommendation or Thomas'). The problem I have with this approach, though, is that if you do centre the H, you end up with the lowercase offset to the left. When a word is set in italics within roman text &ndash; or in roman within italic text &ndash;, I like the space before and after the word to be equal. Following David&rsquo;s recommendation, an italic word drifts to the left. Also, depending on the design, the italic letters may noticeably protrude into a left margin defined by roman letters above and below. For me, the whole question is really what aspect of mixed text setting you wish to compromise.</p>
<p>An illustration to these thoughts is online at: <a href="http://www.tiro.com/John/RomanItalicSpacing2.gif">http://www.tiro.com/John/RomanItalicSpacing2.gif</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I consider the roman and italic spacing method I use as OMEGA tested: In 1992, just previous to my having deciding I&rsquo;d seen everything, a client came and told me they were going to set headlines made of alternating Roman and Italic letters (in a Transitional typeface). The spacing method I&rsquo;ve described was Norbertequesly old by then, but it worked in what I think we could agree was perhaps the most extreme &ldquo;useful&rdquo; case. I.E. mixed words of 12 or 13 degree italics would be more extreme but not likely to be tasty on the eyes. I absolutely know of other methods well enough to tell you when they Could be used (quite often), and when they Will fail (rarely). With enough experience you can use any number of methods because you know what to look out for&hellip;in the mean time, any complaints about the FB, Bitstream or Linotype libraries? I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>
<p>Also, &ldquo;Berownese&rdquo; should always contain some kind of nut, otherwise, they&rsquo;re just lumps of chocolate, which is okay, but after a while you crave something c&rsquo;runchy.</p>
