    if this is a font."

  body: In that case they made a lot of effort since they used this typography for
    several issues both on the cover and inside... maybe a custom set of fonts or
    they scanned it... hence why it looks so nice and random... maybe somebody else
    has a suggestion on something similar?

  body: I don't think it's a custom font either, Pop really uses a lot of hand lettering.
    The cover lines and headlines are also all hand lettered in their current F/W
    08 issue, albeit in a different style.

    be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andinistas/lucrecia/|Lucrecia]] which comes
    with varying degrees of grunginess. It is somewhat scripty, unlike many other
    grunge-brush styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
