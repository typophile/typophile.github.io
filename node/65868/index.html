  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am finally giving a lecture on my vast collection of handmade typography used by merchants to mark pieces of cloth that were sent around the world from manchester, England in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The type was handmade, by hammering copper strips into fruit wood blocks, and many fonts are unique to the textile trade. I have never shown these items before and am hoping that someone will be able to make use or at least be inspired by this unseen part of typographic history.
The Type Directors Club, based in the Garment District of NYC, seems a perfect location for this lecture. I will be showing original sample books, blocks, lettering and describing the history of this long gone typography.

Please come along or pass the invite along to anyone who may be interested in the event.

Thanks

Adrian Wilson

		<div class="commentbody">I am a photographer and could put together a website but really the collection has many varied strands to it, from art history to typography etc so I haven't got around to even thinking about a website.
The talk is hopefully a first step in getting the information out there. I was a guest on the Antiques Roadshow when it went to Manchester but apart from that, this collection has just been sat around. 
Tobias Frere Jones came to see part of the collection and he thought many of the fonts were unique to the textile trade but that was maybe 3 years ago and I have done nothing since in terms of displaying them.
I am hoping the lecture will generate some interest and hopefully lead to an exhibition or maybe some of the fonts could be digitized.

I really have no idea but they are wonderful objects.

I wrote a book years ago (in fact it was on a floppy disc for a while!) but again, I never got around to publishing. I know there are a lot more outlets and even self publishing is easy nowadays but again it is finding time while trying to run a location photography business.
I really appreciate your link though.

		<div class="commentbody">Adrian,
I am a recently graduated Graphic Designer and am working in the printing buisness at the moment. I am greatly interested in these stamps and wondered if you knew of any books which display a range or whether you are thinking of creating a book like this. I think I could take a lot of insperation from them. 
Hope you can help.

Thanks
