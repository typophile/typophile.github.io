A nice mix. I guess I'd say that affected my work by giving me the motivation and tools to easily experiment outside of the computer. Granted, a lot of what we did there ended up with the letterpressed aesthetic, which for us was a nice selling point.</div>

Clients come in all shapes and sizes ;o) <BR> <BR>A lot of our clients were actually other design firms that, obviously, knew of printing methods and media.  <BR> <BR>That said, we also had a lot of wedding/event invite type stuff where people were, IMHO, looking for something more unique. Not necessarily in look, but in terms of production. ie, it added a bit of perceived value to the piece when there was that tactile response (the impression of the type, the thicker paper stock, etc.) We had to hit the paper hard because people wanted to emphasize the fact that it was letterpressed. True letterpress shouldn't really advertise the fact that it was letterpressed. <BR> <BR>Also, folks just found it fun to dig through the type cabinents. <BR> <BR>&quot;Also, when Microsoft was founded how substantially did this affect graphic design?&quot; <BR> <BR>In terms of producing work, not at all. <BR> <BR>&quot; Also why was the introduction the apple so popular?&quot; <BR> <BR>Because it was unlike anything else at the time. It had a mouse, you moved the mouse and it did things on screen. The original apps were geared toward the visual arts. It had the first set of fonts that weren't monospaced, etc.</div>
