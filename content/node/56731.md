  How much do you space before you start kerning? Are there any good methods around?
  (Like strings of letters?)"

    Fast</a>\r\nB: Draw the entire face and do as much spacing as possible before
    you start kerning. I find it a little easier to start with the common and egregious
    pairs like AVA, AWA, T<vowel>, F<vowel>. Once you nail down those you can use
    them to check the spacing a second time. After that set every letter set against
    every other letter and relevant punctuation in Indesign. Use that to build text
    files to import into the metrics window. If you have $500 Tal Leming\u2019s app
    <a href=\"http://tools.typesupply.com/metricsmachine.html\">Metrics Machine</a>
    will make this process exponentially faster. Spacing and kerning words will go
    much faster and be easier if you stick to languages you do not know and if you
    view pages upside-down or sideways.\r\n\r\nGet it onscreen, test in print, repeat
    until you want to die, then start testing using lists of words like Leslie Cabarga\u2019s
    Kern King or one section from the UN Declaration of Human Rights in every single
    language your encoding will support. It also helps to check pairs in different
    light\u2014inside, outside, in subway cars, at coffee shops, etc. Do it with the
    TV on to keep yourself distracted from the words and just look at the spaces."
