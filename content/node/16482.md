    to have his books produced in the best possible production circumstances, this
    results in a book too few can get their hands on, even in terms of library exposure
    (I don't know many libraries with budgets to allow for contemporary productions
    at $2000 a pop). Don't get me wrong, I've recently commented on Peter Koch's production
    of <a href=\"http://www.peterkochprinters.com/show.php?bookid=3\" target=\"_blank\">The
    Fragments of Parmenides</a> (translated {from the Greek}, designed, and co-written
    by Bringhurst), which is probably the best designed, set, printed & bound book
    I've ever seen (at $1850.00 and $3500.00), but I'm left wondering what the purpose
    of that kind of production is when so few will ever see it.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan
    of Robert's work, and he's been very kind to me personally and professionally,
    but it drives me crazy that not in a million years could I afford to collect his
    more specialized books.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also a writer, and if someone was
    up for producing a book of my work at the production level of Parmenides, I'd
    jump at it in a second. Hell, I'd jump off a cliff if they wanted me to. Turning
    the pages of Parmenides was right up there with turning the pages of Jenson's
    Eusebius of 1470. Complete and total wonder."

    same way as Formula One cars: very few people can afford to own one or even get
    to drive one, but they push the boundaries of automative engineering.\r\n\r\nI
    used to work for William Hoffer, who published Robert's first attempted at polyphonic
    typography, <em>The Blue Roofs of Japan.</em> It was certainly cheaper than the
    new volume, but also a limited edition and not something for a general market.
    It was also a lot less elaborate than the new book. I'm pleased to see that Robert
    has found a publisher willing to undertake so complex an unusual a work, at whatever
    cost."

  body: "High priced limited edition books have always been a problem since few can
    afford them. I suppose it is true that this limits the collectibility of them
    to the wealthy for the most part.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand one could consider
    that if a person really wants a deluxe set of golf clubs or a music system, that
    person will somehow dig up the few thousand or so dollars. There is a maker of
    brass instruments in Portland Oregon who makes beautiul old style cornets at $9000
    US a pop. I am an old age pensioner and definitely an amateur musician, but I
    haven't given up on the idea of one day owning one. It's a matter of priority,
    really. I want the horn!\r\n\r\nI am working on the printing of a limited edition
    book (50 copies) that covers my working life and the work produced in my press/foundry.
    I have cut a new typeface and cast it specifically for the book. Buying the $2000
    worth of paper was possible only with the co-publishing kind assistance of people
    outside my press.\r\n\r\nEven at $700 per copy, the work involved will bring me
    somewhere in the neighborhood of six or seven dollars an hour.\r\n\r\nThis is
    by no means a complaint. I merely want to say that time and labour are going into
    the book and the price is not a greedy one. \r\nI am doing this mainly for the
    love of it, because there are ways to make better than the hourly rate I'll be
    getting.\r\n\r\nSo far I have done two books in this vein and relative price range
    and they have not all gone to wealthy collectors. A good many people have bought
    copies for a spouse etc.\r\n\r\nIn the end I guess a private press book is something
    of an enigma. The price is seemingly high, but the originator gets not a lot of
    money. One book I did a few years ago sold for $300. If a person can find a copy
    now the price I am told is $700.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the speculator gets the cash.
    The maker of the book is certainly not overpaid.\r\n\r\nI've enjoyed the comments
    on this thread, and I still understand the exasperation of someone who would like
    to have a book but can't afford it. I can't afford the horn, but I know I'll get
    it. But if you bump into my good lady this is our secret.\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    should we expect life to be fair. The best things in life do not cost anything.\r\n\r\nBut
    in regard to this book, it would be the type of thing I'd like to obtain based
    not only on Bringhurst's reputation (more though as a writer on typography than
    his language work) and its concept, but also because of its production values.
    One look at your example and I would opt out. While high concept, someone certainly
    has little control over their presswork. The leading is increasingly wrong (per
    color) as it travels down the page. This is something that should not have occurred
    (sloppiness, ignorance?). If the plan can't be executed properly, forgo it (but
    let's not get into politics). One would expect to pay this kind of money not only
    for name, and concept, but also production quality. And part of this book's ticket
    is its production qualities. I'd pay highly for examples of masterly work (because
    one can learn from the masters), but this appears not to be the case.\r\n\r\nGerald"
