  Prague, and got this tattoo. This numbers mean the important day for us. \r\nWhen
  I decided to make the same thing, I realized that it\u2019s not so easy to find
  the exact font. \r\nSome of them are too heavy, others have different \u201CM\u201D
  letter shape.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me find this font. \r\nAlready tried myfont
  tool, 50 pages of listings on different sites ant tools like identyfont.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/54321-1000IMG_1320_5147.jpg]"

  body: "Or just take the photo and make the tattoo artist do a drawing of the final
    piece before touching your skin.\r\n(by the way, looking at the sample, it seems
    to me that the lettering inspiration is something more calligraphic than a metal
    typeface like Bodoni)"
