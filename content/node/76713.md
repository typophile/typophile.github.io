  than the original \u201EAkzidenz Grotesk Condensed\u201C does. I think the letterforms
  of the condensed AG are too awkward an it doesn't look like belonging to the family.
  Anybody an idea which could fit better?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nBenny"

  body: "yeah, I considered that already. \r\n\r\nWould anyone agree, that \xBBFlama
    semicondensed\xAB would be a good choice since I want to use that for a signage
    system and the corporate font of the customer is Akzidenz Grotesk but the regular
    one is too wide for signs and the condensed too awkward and the letterforms too
    much closed.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nbenny\r\n\r\n "
