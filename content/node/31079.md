  some time now as you type masters gambol among ligatures and kerning. I'm deeply
  impressed by the breadth and depth of knowledge represented here, and would now
  like to get a piece of the action!\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a bit of logo design I made
  for our small in-house educational materials publishing company. I not only welcome
  critiques on these, I ask for them in imploring tones. I might stoop to begging,
  although hopefully it won't come to that.\r\n\r\nPlease be as theoretical or as
  nitpicky as the mood suits!"

- body: "You're requesting nitpicky?  Are you insane?  I've been thinking of changing
    my official job title to Graphic Nitpicker. :)  \r\n\r\nOverall, I really admire
    the work you've done; it's not easy to make five logos work together.  Can we
    see them all on one page?\r\n\r\nFirst off, Pop Quiz is my favorite. Very clever
    and whimsical - well executed. Nice.\r\n\r\nTapestry needs kerning - especially
    between the T and A ... and the \"STR\".  Also, if you're going to vary the size
    of the text, then perhaps the word \"of\" could be smaller?  Right now it looks
    too close (in size) to the rest of the font. \r\n\r\nI like where you're going
    with \"Writing Aids,\" but I don't understand how changing fonts adds anything.
    Did you try it with one font?\r\n\r\nMap Aids has potential - but I wanna take
    my dustbuster to it. Perhaps fewer swirls, carefully placed with thicker lines,
    would have more impact?\r\n\r\nEgypt works well at small scale - but viewed at
    full size the words \"go\" and \"to\" run together.\r\n\r\nFeeling nitpicked yet?\r\nAlaskan\r\n"

  body: "Take everything I say as my personal opinion, and as how I would approach
    these logos. As with everything, a little bit of Morton's iodized would go well
    with my words.\r\n\r\n1. Tapestry of Grace - The letters could do with more letterspacing.
    Using small caps just breaks down the quick readability and a little more letterspacing
    could help. If you need the overlap of R over A see if there is a swash character
    available and stretch the outline. The \"of,\" because it is the most different
    in forn, is upstaging the rest of the type. If you are going to change size make
    sure you change it enough to make it look like a choice and not a mistake. It
    just ends up clashing here.\r\n\r\n2. Map Aids - What is the intent of the logo,
    because the wordmark of map is communicating \"messy\" and for aids is \"sterile.\"
    Try a more humanist sans for aids, and maybe remove the extra strokes around the
    a and p of map, The geometry is making me feel as if no one really wants to help
    me and I'll get a computer-packaged answer.\r\n\r\n3.Writing aids - Match the
    x-heights on writing and aids, otherwise it communicates a comparative preference
    of writing over the aids and the idea is to make the difference in height large
    enough to not look like a mistake and instead be a conscious choice.\r\n\r\n4.
    POP Quiz - Nice idea. Kerning on the Q and U is off. The tie acts as an arrow
    and leads my eye away from the logo. I never see the word Quiz. Have you experimented
    with other placements for it? Also, look for the swash alternate on the Q, and
    see if you like that better.\r\n\r\n5. Egypt - The idea is a little on the nose.
    Egypt in torn papyrus looking text... a little on the forgettable side. Again
    open up the letterspacing. It's okay to do it, I won't tell, and will help legibility
    at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nOverall, nice explorations, but I feel you can push further.
    Be more experimental and make things more memorable. Make sure you pay attention
    to what the logo is communicating, your message needs to be tighter."

  body: "Thanks Alaskan and Ryan, that's really helpful! I knew my letterspacing was
    off - thanks for detailing that. And Ryan, your impressions of the logos are excellent.
    I definitely feel like I have direction for improvement.\r\n\r\nI was pondering
    last night, I think my word choice of \"logos\" may have been misleading. As I
    mentioned, I work for an educational publishing company, so these logos are product
    logos, more than corporate identities (which doesn't negate any of what was said,
    but I think might be helpful in honing further input).  Go <a href=\"http://www.lampstandpress.com/egypt/index.htm\">here</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.tapestryofgrace.com/tog_fast/index.htm\">here</a> to
    see some of them in context.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogoSheet_5704.gif]\r\nHere
    are all five on one sheet, with brief(ish) explanations. Is that helpful?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
    regarding the input on the sterile sans serif, our corporate font identity consists
    of Minion Pro and Univers (hence those specific choices for Writing Aids). How
    important is it to use the text font in the title, would you say? That is, given
    that the product is set in Minion Pro and Univers (or, for some web products,
    Arial), is it appropriate to put the title in another text sans serif, or would
    that dilute the visual consistency?\r\n\r\nAnd how much wood would a woodchuck
    chuck if he had a land clearing permit and a backhoe?"
