  to get to know at least 4 faces really well. What are your suggestions. '

  body: "Not so much starting palettes, as that would be dependent on the content
    of the job at hand, but you could perhaps take a broad look by looking at one
    solid example of each of some of the major classifications of typeface.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    serifs: an old style (such as Garamond), a transitional (such as Baskerville),
    a modern (such as Bodoni), and a slab (such as Beton); sanserifs: a neo-grotesque
    (such as Univers), a humanistic (such as Gill Sans), and a geometric (such as
    Futura). Examining the design, designers, historical background, and contrasts
    between these is rewarding. The first few pages in Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic
    Style chart the development of type with respective nuances nicely. \r\n\r\nAlso
    a good excercise is to hunt through the available glyphs of a font, to discover
    alternates and other features such as ornaments - the Adobe Originals serif faces
    are good examples.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

  body: "I would suggest looking through some magazines from the 1930s (<em>Saturday
    Evening Post, Fortune, Ladies Home Journal</em>, etc.)  and finding a piece of
    typography that you like the look of, then attempting to create a digital facsimile
    of it.\r\n\r\nThe piece should have sufficient complexity, with small caps used
    somewhere.\r\n\r\nFirstly, you will have to identify the typeface, which may be
    done with the aid of Matt MacGrew's <em>American Metal Typefaces</em>.\r\n\r\nThe
    trickiest part will be justification, as the defaults of digital justification
    are quite different from those of metal type. There was also not so much kerning
    back then.\r\n\r\nThis difficult exercise will help you acquire expert skills
    in layout apps, and give you an appreciation of the relationship between typeface,
    time and technology, which is fundamental to typography. A design such as Garamond,
    for instance, has been re-rendered with each generation of technology and is still
    going strong. \r\n\r\nThe issue of press gain is significant, as it has varied
    over time, and is different for different media (e.g. coated/uncoated stock, screen
    display). There are a number of ways to deal with this, most notably by choosing
    different \"cuts\" of the same typeface, or adding minute amounts of stroke in
    InDesign/Quark, or by playing with the various rasterization settings in Photoshop.
    And one has to be aware of the different rendering abilities of browser applications
    and screen devices.\r\n\r\nYou will find that the effect of a font is quite different
    in a laser printout than when printed offset, or letterpress.\r\n\r\nWith all
    these variables in mind, I would say that for educational purposes, it would be
    best to go with common faces that have been around a while, such as those recommended
    by James, so that you can observe their behavior across the board and compare
    it with your own use of them\u2014although I don't believe that such faces are
    necessarily the best choices for contemporary design, as they are too \"safe\",
    and don't express the emergent zeitgeist as well as new faces do. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
