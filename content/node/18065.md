body: "Hi.\r\nIm not very experienced in font building, and hope on somebodies help.\r\nThe
  goal was to prepare national (abkhazinan)fonts based on modern technological principles
  - Unicode and Open Type. So I make a font and indicates all glyphs according their
  unicode indexes (abkhazian characters are part of cyrrilic coderange and complitely
  regestered in Basic Multilingual Plan of Unicode Concorcium). After generating font
  file and installing in Windows XP system (I use MKLC for national keyboard layout)
  almost everything is OK in MS Office - I can see and type all abkhazian characters
  but when I use  Photoshop or Illustrator or Corel Draw I can type only cyrillic
  characters and one more abkhazian letter Dje (040F, 045F) which is ocasionaly the
  part of 1251 cyrillic codepage. \r\nThe same situation win Adobe CS applications
  but I dont use CS2. \r\nWhy.\r\nThanks, Akhra."

    that font fails in the Adobe apps it's likely that your font isn't to blame.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    body: "Hi, Si.\r\nTahoma like Palatino has some characters which used in abkhazian
      but not all. \r\nAnyway, when I type that (Tahoma abkhaz) characters in Word
      2003 everything is OK, but when I try to do so in Photoshop CS I see only ?
      marks. But when I insert same Tahoma or Palatino characters from character table
      they work in Photoshop. \r\nBy the way I prepare abkhaz keyboard layout using
      Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.\r\n\r\nThanks, Akhra"
