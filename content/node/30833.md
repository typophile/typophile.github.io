  the only usage in a small German book of that title (which means what, btw?) printed
  in Stuttgart in 1952 (the copyright date). I've included the subtitle in Palatino
  to remind us how effete the digital version is - just look at the \"s\" and \"t\"...

    If so, it probably replaced that funky blackletter form - which might have been
    seen as too old-fashioned (and/or, this being post-WWII, probably too German)
    especially in light of the \"progressive\" lower-casization in the subtitle.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant\r\n\r\nThat one sent me diving for the script section of the Jaspert,
    Johnson & Turner Berry 'Encyclopedia of Typefaces' (1958). If you've got a copy,
    the following image appears on p.306. Your example above, IMHO looks like a cleaned-up
    version of the same face (I think there are structural similarities between the
    two). There again, I could always be wrong... don't think there is a digital version
    around of this either.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Balzac-ref_4749.jpg]"

    is showing at top is far tastier anyway; does anyone think it'd be worth Hrant's
    while to quiz the archives at Stempel to see if there was ever an alternate 'smooth'
    Balzac produced?"

  body: "Man, some people will digitize anything.\r\n\r\nBen, thanks for finding that
    - I do have the Jaspert. Balzac must be it: it has that distinctive bad \"k\",
    and the date & location make sense. The difference of finish we're seeing between
    my book's setting and the Jaspert sample is most probably due simply to scale:
    irregularity gets more diluted the smaller the size, both optically and mechanically
    (ink gain). They probably relied too heavily on the pantograph, ending up with
    a \"size-ignorant\" finish - unlike in the case of masterful Mistral, shown here
    (size normalized) in a large point size and a small:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mistral_big_3627.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mistral_small_4011.gif]\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
