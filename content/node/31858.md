  body: There's no real technique -- it's all about recognising certain glyph shapes
    or an overall design.

  body: I'm not sure it's memorization as much as having a part of your brain that
    is able to make connections between certain letter styles and their designers
    or placement in the context of the font world. I have a terrible memory.

  body: "i agree  with you stephen... the 'connections' thing is definitely a part
    of it...\r\n\r\nand retoid,  i agree it isn't it, but i think the sample you put
    up is a bad copy of it\r\n"

  body: With the "overall design" bit I meant that sometimes I recognize the specific
    style of a type designer or a foundry which makes finding the damn thing so much
    easier. That's extremely useful when you recognize a face but can't remember the
    name right away. This concurs with what Stephen said.
