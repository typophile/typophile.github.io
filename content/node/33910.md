  font, he is going to get a Master's in Graphic Design and this would be a fantastic
  gift for him. I finally tracked down the name of the font yet it seems impossible
  to find it online for download. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nFont name is L&C Hairline"

  body: You may be right that it's L&C Hairline, but it's very similar to standard
    <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/>Futura</a>. It doesn't
    seem, unfortunately, that L&C Hairline has been digitized; my guess is that the
    designer of the poster just customized Futura himself or herself. I'd just buy
    a terrific Futura font family for him and call it a day.

  body: "L&C Hairline was digitized years ago by The Image Club. It is also closer
    to an Avant Garde (it was the basis of Avant Garde Extra Light) than a Futura.\r\n\r\nThe
    font can be seen here: http://www.incipit.com/typefaces.html"

    the first typefaces we licensed IIRC...
