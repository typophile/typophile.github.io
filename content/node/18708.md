  body: This is a really nice old gothic. The closest I can get is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FB.100194.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=IFTHEYWORKED&sampleSize=30">Rhode
    Medium</a>, but the 'R' and 'K' is special and I think we would see a lot of irregularity
    in the forms if we had a closer look.

  body: It looks very much like Knockout (Cruiserweight), but there are a few tiny
    differences - the "E"s and the question mark are not quite the same. Really close,
    though.

  body: If it's a bit "soft" in the corners and abit clumsy, it might be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/landry-gothic/">Landry
    Gothic</a>

  body: "I was going bleary-eyed looking at Sans samples at MyFonts, and when I hit
    Andrew Lehman's 'Landry Gothic', I said that's it! Jan, I think you nailed it.
    To me it has all the right earmarks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
