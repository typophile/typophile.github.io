    OT rasterizers are generally more forgiving than TT rasterizers so sometimes there's
    no avoiding having to tweak the outlines to make them more TT autohint-friendly.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option is ttfautohint. (There's Windows and 'Nix executables available but I'm
    not sure about Mac.) Does pretty well with bold outlines, especially those with
    a lot of straight lines. A work in progress."

  body: "@Hrant: Well, conversion is OK if you compare and check against the original
    PS contours. First, I erase the mask layer and copy all the glyphs to mask layer.
    Only then I  convert the foreground to TTF outlines and I go glyph by glyph checking
    is everything is fine and eventually tweaking some details in TTF outlines. \r\nAvoid
    \"in poitn BCPs\" (BCPs with zero value). They distort the contour when the line

  body: Interesting discussion with Dan R on twitter about this just now; I suppose
    'non hinting' is a better description than 'magic hinting' - setting the PREP
    and GASP tables with 'magic numbers' improves rendering over no hinting tables
    at all, and while it is no substitute for top quality hand hinting, it doesn't
    effect the filesize at all :)

    stripped out of the fonts when served to Mac based browsers to reduce file sizes,
    and you simply can't remove religion (or magic) from any Mac/Windows debate. \r\n\r\nSo
    maybe \"mythic hints\" or maybe \"social hints\" might be better. :-)\r\n\r\nSi"
