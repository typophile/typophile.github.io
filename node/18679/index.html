		<div class="commentbody">Have you met Karen Cheng Si! I just pre-ordered the book because I am too impatient to wait for reviews but I wondered if you knew anything about her background and why she would be a good author of a type design book.  I Googled her and could not find any type designs to her credit.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris,

Karen teaches the typography course at the University of Washington, and I heard about her and her book from one of her students, Microsoft's own Kevin Larson. When Kevin joined the Advanced Reading Technology group he decided to go do a type course so he could better understand what people like Mike and Geraldine were  talking about. I think this was also part of Kevin's secret plan to become an A-list superstar speaker at typography conferences.
 
I met Karen for the first time on Sunday and got to briefly see the books (English and German) for the first time as well. It struck me as a very methodical, practical, hands-on manual describing the process of designing a western font. My initial reaction was also that it will be a bit controversial, with seasoned pro's exclaiming "you can't distil my fifty years of experience into a how-to guide!" But I think even non-beginers will get something out of it, for example the part on diacritics (some Twardochian principles seem to be in use).

I don't think people will feel cheated out of their $20, and I'm going to order copies for my team. I think John Berry is writing a review so if people want to wait, they might want to check out his thoughts before ordering, but I say go for it!

As for why she did the book? I'm sure all will be revealed at the talk, but I'll ask her and report back.  

Si</div>

Hrant show me the book during our lunch in LA and had the chance to literally flip through the pages and at first glance it looks like it could be useful to beginning type design in the context of class study.

I'm sure there will be yays & nays and I look forward to Hrant's and John B's reviews. As Hrant explained to me, some of Karen's students assisted with the project.</div>

Please don't buy your books from Amazon.  They are making it nearly impossible for the independent bookseller to survive.  It is not acceptable to bring a discount book into a real bookstore for a signing.  If you want a signed copy of a title, buy it from the store hosting the signing & keep an eye on the bigger picture.

Didn't mean to offend anyone. I linked to the German Amazon site as I couldn't find a direct link to the German publisher. In this case the signing will happen at a gallery, not a book shop. But I suspect the copies the author sells at the talk would be considered harmful to indie book stores too.</div>

I live in Virginia and will not be attending the book signing in Seattle. (I don't think I need to be coached on the no-no of bringing a book from another vendor to a book signing.) Am I still allowed to buy the book or do I need your approval on all my book purchases? I buy many more books than I can afford as it is.  If I pay retail prices, to make you happy, I will just buy fewer books and the only person who will be happy is you. If you want me to still pay retail, send me the difference in price and I will buy from the merchant of your choice.  That way everyone will be happy, the author, the publisher, the bookstore, and you.

Oops again. Didn't realize that the signing would not be happening in the auditorium - if Karen will only be signing books in the store then I'd agree it would be very bad form to bring in your Amazon purchases for her to sign. I'm sure no one on typophile would do that. As for me I don't tend to line up for book signings, line up at the bar maybe, but not to have a book signed.

Designing Type
A Lecture by Karen Cheng 
Thursday, April 13/ 6:00pm - 8:00pm
A reception and book signing will follow the lecture. 
Henry Art Gallery
15th Ave NE and NE 41st Street
University of Washington 

Typefaces are one of the graphic designer's most essential tools; they can determine the success or failure of visual communication. In her new book, Designing Type, Karen Cheng examines what makes a good typeface, describing in detail how to construct letters, numbers, and accents in serif and sans-serif systems. 

Cheng analyzes a wide range of classic and modern typefaces, including many from today's premier contemporary type foundries. In the rapidly broadening market for original and custom fonts, Designing Type is an excellent reference for experienced professionals and novice designers. 

Hosted by Peter Miller Books
Co-sponsored by the Simpson Center for the Humanities 


Cheers, Si</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>Review?

First off I had a pint of the Amber, it was okay, but had a bit of that fizzy homebrew aftertaste. Then when some others arrived we got a pitcher of the Scarlett IPA, described as an “experiment” by the barkeep it was actually pretty nice, had good color, and didn’t have the kick of some other IPA’s. It was pretty smooth. 

As for the talk, the auditorium was full, I’d guess about 180 people, with a number standing. Karen stood at the base of the stage and her style was pretty entertaining, a touch of self deprecating humor, and jokes which seemed to be a hit with the crowd. Using questions reproduced from four or five student evaluation forms, her short (no more than half an hour) talk was really an entry-level introduction to the appreciation and understanding of type – and was at the right level for the audience who seemed to be mostly students, ex students, friends and local celebrities (Kevin Larson & John D. Berry being two I recognized). One question, “What’s the absolute best font in the world and what is the absolute worst font in the world”, was typical of the questions, and provided a way for Karen to show bad type used badly, and student work, and spreads from her book. There was plenty of time left for audience questions and these again were the typical, legibility type questions “why do you use sans fonts on signage” and standard fare “how do designers name their fonts” – again reinforcing this as not a specialist font crowd. Still a worthwhile event.

		<div class="commentbody">Does anyone know the difference between the englisch and the german version? On the german publisher's website it says:

"Es ist toll, hierzulande auf hochkompetente Schriftentwerfer wie Henning Krause bauen zu können, der daraus mit Akribie die Anatomie der Buchstaben [weiter]entwickelt hat."

"It is good to be able to rely on highly competent type designers like Henning Krause in this country, who, with meticulousness, developed [further] the 'Anatomy of Typefaces'" (which is the german (sub)title of the book).

It also says in the credits:
"[mehr als nur] übersetzt von Henning Krause"
"[more than just] translated by Henning Krause"


So, does anyone know the differences?
I know that Hermann Schmidt always produces premium-quality books at high price (german edition: 68€, english edition: 27€), and as native speaker and book-lover i will get the german edition anyway, but it would be interesting to know what has been changed...

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Sebilar,
There are very minor differencesbetween the German version and the English version. The largest difference is that the German version has a different type classification chapter, since their system goes by different terminology. Also, the German version uses Quadraat as the body text (rather than Univers) — and it is printed as a casebound book (hardback) with a different title.

I think the "more than just translated" bit refers to Henning's self-appointed role as an editor, fact-checker and proofreader. Henning made many editorial suggestions throughout, especially in the section on accents/diacritics. He was particularly helpful (as a native speaker of German, and as an experienced type designer) with questions I had about the German eszett.

		<div class="commentbody">I purchased Designing Type at the Seattle event. Although I haven't been through the whole book yet, here's my take:

The book is a mostly visual compendium of  the options  presented in the design of letterforms. Each page could potentially comprise a Typophile thread. For example, how would one design a 'Q'? The advantage here is that hours and hours of discussions are distilled into a single useful reference. I'm not aware of any other documentation, web or print, that is this focused on the shapes of letters. 

Many books on typography tend to cover too many topics and end up being fairly shallow. This book only makes historical references when it is necessary for classification purposes. This is a good thing. The book also avoids much technological discussion. The information would useful for someone cutting Monotype matrices or working in FontLab.

Also, I think I had a taste of the Scarlet IPA out of Sii's pitcher. It was quite good. I owe him, or someone he was with, a pint.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">i got the book and it's kind of interesting. the book reviews the construction of [[Serif]] and [[Sans Serif]] letters. If you've been building letters for a while, a lot of the relationships should be well known to you, other small details it's interesting to see compared from style to style and spelled out specifically. This book would be an even better resource if italics and obliques were covered as well... maybe there will be a sequel. I'm wondering if the book was edited at any point by a type designer or two as some statements come off a little odd. Overall, a good resource, especially for beginners.</div>

To be fair, every type book by anybody has some of those.
Like have you <cite>ever</cite> read a convincing passage about why serifs matter?

BTW, what does "buchstaben" mean?

I think ‘Buchstabel’ means ‘a letter’ so maybe it would be ‘to make letters’ (Like designing type).

		<div class="commentbody">I'll take a whack at an off-the-cuff review:

Useful, but ultimately not necessary. The analysis is limited to roman (i.e. upright) letterforms with a strong bias toward normative shapes, and text faces (but Hoefler's Didot when it appears is one of the display masters). There is little history (which admittedly wouldn't fit) but even less context. I wonder if all the attention to measuring production details is wasted when what all designers need (both users and makers of type) is visual sensitivity. The student work that is scattered throughout the book is immature, and doesn't show much in the way of strong design concepts; compared to the work from graduates of KABK and the University of Reading. Unlike more polemic, or quirkier, treatments of typeforms and how they are made or passed down to us (Noordzij, Young, Smeijers, etc.) this book seems to basically encourage minor riffs on the typefaces of the twentieth century. For a book seemingly devoted to textfaces, there are few examples & discussions of text composition showing how the details work in practice. The fact that the US edition is set in Univers vs. the more recent Quadraat, says something about its timidity. And I still love Univers to this day.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">> yes, “Buchstaben” is the 1:1-translation to “letter”.

Etymologically, “der Buchstabe” is a compound word of “Buch”+“Stab”, which literally means “book bar”, i.e. it stands for a piece of printing type. Funnily enough, the original meaning of “Buchstabe” (a piece of printing type) has been expanded, so these days it just means “letter” (as part of any writing/script/type). Through reverse translation, printing type is now called “die Type”, “die Drucktype” or... “die Letter”.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">A few impressions.
All who do type already know what is necessary to make n m r &c look right, or how to deal with X and W diagonals. Nevertheless this is a good source for studying how others did it, and to see examples from different typefaces next to each other. I find these ones particularly interesting: overlap comparisons e.g. for a/n, r/n, V/W, c/r-bowl (though I miss f and s here), or the i/j/f/t-structure comparisons. I had wished for even more such examples.
As to the selection of typefaces, I am not sure if it is the best one, but one could question every selection.
However, I would ask that all books of this kind -- including "the Bringhurst" or "the Tschichold"* -- should bear a label: "I am not the bible." If this book is understood as an encouragement to look closer at letterforms, it has done a good job already.

For example, observe how many "r"s have a foot serif with equal sides.

		<div class="commentbody">Now I purchased the german version. Very beautiful book, it's worth even if it would only turn out to be another jewel in the bookshelf :-)

For the content: Not too much new findings, even to me, who is into the topic for only about one or two years (or is it almost three already?).

As peter_bain already said: I don't know if all the measuring done is necessary. I don't think type designers construct their typefaces in that manner, but it is the result of a visual process.

But for one thing, the book is very useful to me: I can check my letters after designing them, being reminded to details I might not have considered without the book. It prevents me from embarrassing situations like proudly presenting an "r" with equal foot serifes ;-)

What I miss is something like this:
http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics
Some kind of "learn how to write" and "learn how to see".

What I also miss is some more detailed information on italics, bold, smallcaps etc. and how they are related to the roman. But I guess that's okay, otherwise this book would have much more pages...

And of course, one should not expect something like this, typedesign is too complex than it could be put on 200-and-something pages. There may be (a) sequel(s), as it says in the foreword (namely italics).

On the student works: I've seen much more interesting drafts done by beginners on typophile...

Altogether, this sounds sceptical, but in fact I'm happy to have bought the book. One just must not expect to buy the nonplus ultra how-to-be-a-typedesigner-in-two-weeks-guide. And I know this never was the intention of the book.

		<div class="commentbody">Actually Karen and I talked about a potential sequel of Designing Type. We’re both fully aware of all the missing characters and designs. In fact things have to and will always come to an end - all things actually. After 230 pages with hundreds of illustrations and thousands of captions it is a good idea to simply release something to check the market needs first. There is a lot to add of course. Obviously we could begin with the principles of designing italic and oblique faces, add some info on caps (rapidly filling another 200 pages) and finally leaving the unfinished work to our bereaved as we died whilst analysing kerning differences between superior numerals and numerators in Georgian text faces (hello hrant ;-). While I can imagine that a book on italic and caps has its market, discussing the latter is possibly better hosted in an online forum like this one. Get me right: I'm NOT saying that these questions are less important. I'm just talking about market - the number of copies sold at the end of the day.

There’s quite a lot of people that don’t design type all day. They will find "Designing Type" extremely useful, for sure. My assumption is, that people are going to use the book because it is useful - regardless whether its title is "Designing Type" or "800 commented Letter Designs" or if the shrink wrapper is clear or white (that one goes directly to Mr. Bi‘lak). Of course all of the experienced type designers get a bit bored to read what they already know. My German introduction opens "Real cooks don’t need cookbooks." and  ends with "But even the best cooks (surreptitiously) look things up from time to time."
