  body: "A new version, named \"K22 GKW Computer\", based on the graphic in your link,
    was just (Oct 1) created and posted by \"Toto\" in alt.binaries.fonts.\r\n\r\nHis
    fonts normally appear on www.fontspace.com shortly after their initial post. His
    comments (unfortunately not as an associated readme file) included:\r\n\r\n\"Here's
    K22 GKW Computer based on G.K.W. Computer attributed to American Type\r\nFounders
    in an image of a letter transfer that I have (see attached.)\r\n\r\nThis is something
    that I would not normally do but someone told me it hasn't\r\nbeen done yet. Also
    when I checked the Solotype Catalog, GKW Computer\r\nmatched the sample text for
    Moore Computer (on page 70) except for the H.  I\r\nthought the H might be an
    alternate but the link to a site posted by\r\nMindofone in the Auto Mission thread
    has the character set of Moore Computer\r\nand definitely showed it is not GKW
    Computer. Only 2 letters differ in the\r\nalphabet but many differences in the
    numerals and punctuations. \"\r\n\r\n  - Herb VB"
