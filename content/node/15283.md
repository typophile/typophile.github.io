  to InDesign. A simple <em>copy-paste</em> doesn't seem to work for me. I loose the
  grid in the process. \r\nIt works fine when I import or <em>place</em> the Words
  document in InDesign, but that is not a good solution for the job I have to do since
  the Words documents I receive from my client contain hundreds of tables. Unless
  I recompile the data and place one table per Words document which would take months.\r\n\r\n"

    or after) is selected before you cut-and-paste, otherwise it gets hashed. Importing
    the file often works better.\r\n\r\nAdobe has an excellent forum for InDy help,
    both mac and PC:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?14@@.ee6b330\r\n\r\nAlthough
    it's listed as \"user-to-user\", many Adobe wizards hang out there.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    just re-read your post, & realize that you tried to \"place\"; not enough coffee
    yet this morning ... although sometimes it works best to place into a \"scratch\"
    file, then you cut-and-paste within InDy, not between 2 applications. "
