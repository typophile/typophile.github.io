  body: Looks like some sort of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-bodoni|Bodoni
    Compressed]] but hard to say with the distortion, serifs look bigger on my suggestion.
    A [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bodoni-rr-black-condensed|Bodoni Condensed
    Black]] might work as well.

  body: "This was a typeface known as \"Roman\" which was popular during the third
    quarter of the 19th century. Note the extreme thick-thin contrast like Didot or
    Bodoni. Also note the huge pointed-wedge shaped beaks on E, G, L, T & S and mini
    unbracketed serifs. Foundry terminology varied but Roman Extra Condensed Italic,
    or Roman Elongated Slope would fit.  Here is a condensed version, with no slope,
    from Bruce Foundry 1869.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RomanCond@Bruce1869p55_3914.jpg]\r\nAFAIK
    \"Roman\" is not digitized in a precise match to your image.\r\nDon"

    Type Foundry and possibly some digitizations of "Roman" as identified by him:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/roman-x|Roman X]] (no more available
    to sell unfortunately), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/penny|Penny]]

  body: "Thanks Ryuk for posting the Wooden Type Foundry fonts. I won't duplicate
    the references.\r\nA few more: Matthew Carter's <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/899985/Regular-product.html/\">Elephant
    Regular</a> is a well designed presentation of a design that is somewhere between
    Thororowgood and the font that formed the basis for your image. Somewhat similar
    is Monotype's 1931 design for <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/falstaff/\">Falstaff</a>.
    Berthold's 1860 design, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/normande-bq/\">Normand
    BQ</a> includes a condensed version and an italic version but not a condesnsed
    italic. There is also a Bitstream version of Normande.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "For a not exact, but fairly close to your image, rendition of the letters
    in your image see the following image using Woodentype's Roman Xtra Cond, wqhich
    also shows the letters with a slope of 4 degrees:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RomanXCondWoodentype_5066.jpg]\r\nI
    have no idea how you could purchase this font. MyFonts does not sell it and the
    website http://www.woodentypefonts.com/, which used to sell it, merely has a notice
    in Russian that the website is suspended. Perhaps someone has current info on
    the foundry?\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
