    It seems brilliant to work with such a big type system and get the text and display
    typefaces out of the same type system.\r\n\r\nI think K/R/Z in Alternates are
    too obtrusive though."

    makes them perfect for the obtrusive typography typical of fashion magazines and
    the like ;-)"

    I like a bit of tension, especially in display use, but it doesn't seem a good
    idea to have this vertical cut which can't be found anywhere in the typeface.
    I suppose it's a matter of taste, but I feel K/OO/R/Z go completely against the
    core design principle of the font. I can elaborate on why I feel this is the case.\r\n\r\nI'm
    all for prominent and slightly \"off\" elements in a display font, but it shouldn't
    become obtrusive. And to be clear, obtrusiveness is inherently bad. You make it
    sound as if obtrusiveness is exactly what the fashion magazines are looking for
    but that is not the case."

    winked. That said, I do find most fashion (or fashionable) magazines\u2019 typography
    obtrusive, as most fashion photography for that matter. Not aesthetically displeasing,
    mind you, but in antithesis with Warde\u2019s \u201Ccrystal goblet\u201D principle.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    it\u2019s not that you <em>need</em> to use the alternates, anyway ;-)"

    seem to be misunderstanding sarcasm.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>That said, I do find most
    fashion (or fashionable) magazines\u2019 typography obtrusive.</blockquote>\r\nI
    wouldn't necessarily use the word 'obtrusive' here but I know what you mean. In
    most cases though there is logic behind the \"obtrusive\" details. I feel the
    OO ligature is nice on its own and it's a nice graphical element to use in fashion
    (the Gucci and Chanel logos basically do the same, and I've seen the double O
    in several fashionable typefaces) but it just doesn't fit the typeface. It's completely
    out of place. I feel the same about the Z as it has vertical cuts which are nowhere
    to be found anywhere else in the typeface. The horizontal cut on K/R is something
    I've seen in fashion before (Prada does it in their logo as well) but again it
    doesn't fit with the typeface at all. If you look at the letter shapes of the
    Prada logo you feel the horizontal cut in R is logical in a sense because the
    shapes are squared, there are sudden angles and the /A has an extended terminal.
    Without these aspects the horizontal cut on the leg of /R wouldn't work. Right
    now it's a bit obtrusive but coherent. With just the horizontal cut it would just
    be obtrusive. Similarly, I feel the alternates of Beausite lack logic and coherence
    while the typeface in general is brilliant and beautiful. I suppose I'm just puzzled.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And,
    it\u2019s not that you need to use the alternates, anyway ;-)</blockquote>\r\nI
    get that, and I wouldn't. I'm just surprised to see these alternates because I
    feel they go against the logic behind the typeface."
