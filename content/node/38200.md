  thinkness as verticals and horizontals... sofar I found out that if a vertical has
  50 point thickness the diagonal has to been 57 or sow ... Then I'm i doubt...\r\n\r\n\r\ncould
  anyone sum up a good reciepie on doing a good diagonal that has the same thinkness
  as a ver. and hori.\r\n\r\nthx."

  body: I don't know if there's a recipe, but I do know that diagonals generally have
    to be heavier than verticals to make them look the same weight (as you did here).
    I'd do whatever looks right to you -- that's what most of these optical correction
    "rules" are there for.

    or along the horizontal axis? In Adobe Garamond Pro, for example, the width of
    the thick stroke of the X at right angles to the stroke is about 77, narrower
    than the stems of the H, at 82. If you measure the breadth of that same heavy
    diagonal of the X horizontally, that measurement is bigger than the stem, at 96.\r\n\r\nEspecially
    because diagonals are often tapered, there is no simple rule on this that I know
    of.    "

  body: "If you're measuring the diagonals in the horizontal direction (parallel to
    the baseline), then there can't be a rule to follow. \r\nThat distance would change
    depending on the angle of the stroke: the more upright the diagonal, the closer
    the distance would be to a vertical stem width, the less upright the diagonal,
    the wider that distance would be.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the angles of diagonals
    are usually different in K, k, w, v, etc. Even if each of those strokes had exactly
    the same weight (measuring at a right angle to the stroke), each would measure
    differently in a purely horizontal measurement.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: 'You have to measure the thickness of a diagonal stroke at right angles to
    the angle of the stroke. As the eye perceives a horizontal line to be thicker
    than a vertical one of the same actual thickness, horizontals have to be made
    a bit thinner to appear optically the same. A diagonal being somewhere in between
    horizontal and vertical, it will generally also need to be slightly thinner than
    a vertical to match the optical thickness of the vertical. The eye is the best
    judge of how much in any particular circumstance. '
