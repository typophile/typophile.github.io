  body: "Goudy Old Style with some sort of weight reduction. \r\n\r\nOne way to get
    this effect: In Illustrator, add a stroke to the text (1 pt. for the size shown);
    convert to outlines and expand the stroke; finally, using the Pathfinder palette,
    subtract the expanded stroke from the body of the letters.\r\n\r\nThere are other
    ways to do this, but something like this has been done."
