body: When I was first in school for design I remember finding the Pricing &amp; Ethical
  Guidelines book and found it very intriguing.  I also found it cool that there was
  a organized union for Designers, and they could help you get a lawyer if  you ever
  felt ripped off.  &#40;nice insurance for those of us in school weary of becoming
  a freelancer&#41;.  I never did join but was something I wanted to do once I graduated
  school. <BR> <BR>Anyway in the middle of here I transfered to Portland Oregon. <BR>
  <BR>The head of design of my new school is an AIGA member&#40;an organization that
  is a lot more potent it seems than GAG&#41; and he stresses that AIGA is very important
  to join, just for the contacts alone.  The only impact I feel they have had in my
  community is a bunch of guest speakers &#40;and I am not complaining&#41;.  On the
  surface level they seem to offer a lot of the same stuff that GAG does. <BR> <BR>So
  I am a little confused.  Who does what?  If they both do the same thing who should
  I join?  Should I even join at all? <BR> <BR> <BR>A while back I was talking to
  a friend of mine who is also the head of the AIGA student group, and I asked him...
  <BR> <BR>&#34;What does AIGA do?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;pfft no one really knows&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>I graduate really soon and am confused.  I was hoping I could get some
  good testimonials on here. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any information.

  body: After not attending a single AIGA function for 5 years, I gave up my membership.  It
    is better for young people as a place to meet.  Our local chapter does a lot of
    TGIFing at bars.  It is definitely a 30s and younger thing. If you are new in
    your area, it might be something to join for a year or two.

  body: '&#34;he stresses that AIGA is very important to join, just for the contacts
    alone&#34; <BR> <BR>He&#39;s 100% right about that. AIGA&#39;s main benefit to
    any member is that it&#39;s a good networking tool. <BR> <BR>The other benefits
    are all debatable. Some folks find a lot to get out of the AGIA, some folks don&#39;t.
    I was in it throughout school and a handful of years afterwords before finally
    bowing out. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not a union of any sort. More of a club.'

  body: I&#39;ve been an on-again-off-again member since being in school. For me,
    it&#39;s the events and the possiblity for networking that matters. But even then,
    it can be hard if the design community is insular. <BR> <BR>AIGA seems like one
    of those things where 50% scoff and roll their eyes and 50% treat it as part of
    being a designer. I&#39;m still undecided.
