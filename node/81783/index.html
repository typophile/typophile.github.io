its presented by stephen fry, very very interesting.

http://www.dailymotion.com/user/xSilverPhinx/28?tabs_selected=member

its called the "the machine that made us" all three parts are present in the link, my advice is to open them all in different tabs instead of one at a time as u then have to look through 24 pages to find part 2 and part 3 all over again.

the ending is great, they make a 15th century printing press from scratch.</div>

Was it? It may be now, but I would imagine there were legitimate options at the time.
(There were many variations of Shakespeare in his day, for instance.)
Printing may be somewhat responsible for standardized spelling of family names.

		<div class="commentbody">While spelling does change a lot, I doubt there would have been much confusion between the German -berg and -burg. The words may sound similar, but one implies a hill, and the other a fortress/castle/etc. Both are very common in place names. Spelling Gutenberg as <em>Gutenburg</em> is incorrect. I doubt that the comparison with one of various spellings of Shakespeare is apt.</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">According to your logic, it would be, because the implied meanings of the different Shakespeare spellings are not the same— "pear" (fruit), and "pere" (father) in particular being quite different. 

But does meaning have much to do with the spelling of surnames?

In those days there was in Britain significant variance in spelling, so it's unlikely that people attached any great significance to the literal meaning of family names. I would imagine such variance occurred in other countries too, as uniformity of spelling is, in theory, a condition which can mainly be attributed to the printing press.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, German spelling has for a long time tended to be more regular and phonetically reliable than English spelling, in part because it has not inherited the same complexity of etymological sources. In German ‘Gutenberg’ and ‘Gutenburg’ are not only spelled differently but pronounced differently. They are different names: as different as Goodhill and Goodcastle.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It was a great documentary – Stephen Fry had the opportunity to make a piece of metal type –lucky man. On this subject: As we all know documentaries on typography and type design are very rare and when they come along they are watched avidly. (At least by me) Does anyone remember a programme on BBC about 20 years ago – As far as I recall it was a kind of top 20 of typefaces –
it featured Freda Sack of The Foundry making pencil drawings – Not a lot to go on but I would love to know if anyone had a copy
as I would love to see it again.</div>
