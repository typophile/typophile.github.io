  body: "It looks like some variation on a Bauhaus-style font. It's possible a tail
    on the 'a' has been chopped off. Often with Bauhaus-looks, if it isn't actual
    ITC Bauhaus, you can often piece it together with some of the fonts in House Chalet.\r\n\r\nSee
    the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html|Bauhaus-style Font ID
    Guide]] to scan through some of the related styles.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
