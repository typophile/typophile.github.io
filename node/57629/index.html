		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all your comments. I plan to ask for a copy of the book, but I&rsquo;m still a little fuzzy on the licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Guifa: Yes, the fonts are outlined in the file I&rsquo;ll submit; but all the work I sell (publish or print) myself consists of outlined fonts when I submit the final file. Obviously I pay to license the fonts. Is that all a designer needs to do to avoid paying a license - rasterize or outline? That seems unethical and wrong to me.</p>
<p>I always make clients license the fonts I use, even if it&rsquo;s for a newspaper ad and they&rsquo;ll never use the font again. So why wouldn&rsquo;t this author be required to license the fonts? Can somebody clarify?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You have it all wrong, David. About 70% of the work I do is volunteer. I don&rsquo;t have a greedy bone in my body, and my bank account proves it.</p>
<p>I require clients pay for a font (once!) because THEY are the one printing the work, not me. I&rsquo;m simply designing for them, and they&rsquo;re not paying ME for the font, they&rsquo;re paying the type designer directly. If I were an in-house designer, the company would buy the font, right?</p>
<p>As far as the book is concerned, I had no idea how to handle it. I simply didn&rsquo;t want to be taken advantage of. I&rsquo;ve had my work stolen so often that it&rsquo;s extremely rare to have somebody ask permission beforehand. The book is on a very hot, historic topic and I expect it will sell very well. Seriously well, especially with an October release.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem right that a publisher doesn&rsquo;t pay anything to the artists whose art <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the book. The author says it&rsquo;s a 200 page book with 186 posters, very minimal writing. 186 artists, and the author and the publisher are the only people that profit?</p>

<p>Approaching it from the other end:
The client needs to license fonts as soon as he is handed files (for InDesign, Illustrator, etc) which, for modification or printing or generating PDFs, require that fonts are installed on his computer.
But if the client receives files with text converted to outlines or rasterized, or receives PDFs with fonts embedded (please check the EULA for this point), he can modify or print or generate PDFs without fonts being installed on his computer, and in this case does not need to license them.</p>
<p>[Alaskan] <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip; but all the work I sell (publish or print) myself consists of outlined fonts when I submit the final file.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Oh, this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a worry. I think that we all assumed (jumped to the conclusion:) that this would be an academic endeavour with your poster as an example, to illustrate a point.

<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s why Wall Street brokers have surreptitiously gotten into publishing art books. (Did I mention that I can get you a good deal on ocean-front property in Arizona?)</p>
<p>There is an old saying about publishing &ndash; it is a good way to make a small fortune, as long as you start with a large one. And you can achieve this much faster with art books.</p>
<p>As far as the popularity of poster work goes, Tom Eckersley got an OBE for his poster work during World War II. Fame, but no fortune.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: would the author have a viable book without your poster? With only 187 images &ndash; or with 188, using one other than yours?</p>
<p>I do wish you good luck, but check out the realities of book publishing before making a demand for a fee for including your work in a book.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If it&rsquo;s a 186 poster book with 200 pages, there could easily be a solid 30-60 pages of writing, which could indeed be a pretty serious bit of writing.</p>
<p>While when I write an academic work on literature I can easily reference multiple works citing only the most relevant part since presumably any major library at a research university will have them or can quickly retrieve them with ILL, pieces on visual works (especially posters which can be have very short public lives and may not otherwise be published in any other place),  illustrations are a necessity and may not be available in published form anywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d discuss the work some with the author, to see precisely how he wants to go about the work.  If it&rsquo;s a mere collection, then you&rsquo;ll likely want to ask for compensation, but (I think I lean more to this) if it&rsquo;s a substantial work that requires illustrations to be meaningful, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary.  Actually, just ask him to see a draft copy of the chapter he&rsquo;s using your book and maybe the introduction too.  Contractual obligations with the publisher aside, he&rsquo;ll probably let you take a look, and from what you read you can decide how to proceed.  Liberal arts publishing, at least from my experience in the literature world, isn&rsquo;t quite as secretive as, say, science publishing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Alaskan, maybe I can cite a couple of examples from the type community&hellip; First example: Tamye Riggs recently posted a request here (and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->elsewhere<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) for work using certain typefaces considered to be classic, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the book is due to be published in June<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The other example: When Leslie Cabarga was writing his <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logo, Font and Lettering Bible<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, he sent out requests to designers he knew, and he got many illustrations for his book this way. Everyone received credit, and got some exposure in exchange. A win-win situation for all involved, I suppose.</p>
<p>I think that this author has gone about things the right way &ndash; he&rsquo;s written you in advance to request your permission to use your work. Of course, you don&rsquo;t know this professor the way you might know Tamye or Leslie, but you could find out if he&rsquo;s published other books &ndash; that might give you some reassurance as to his intentions. Or, as Matthew suggests, ask him if you can see a draft, a chapter, etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all your advice, Typophiles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten further clarification. The book is strictly a collection; several posters will fold out into full-sized posters, and several gate folds. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;oversized deluxe&rdquo; edition, and the only writing is an intro page and an index of artists with mini-bios at the end.</p>
<p>This is not an educational book about poster design techniques at all &ndash; it&rsquo;s definitely a coffee table book. If it were &ldquo;The History of Posters&rdquo; I&rsquo;d have jumped at the chance without a second thought. This book is a gift item, not a collegiate text. I guess I should have made that clear from the start of the thread, huh?</p>
<p>So, does that change how I should proceed? I still haven&rsquo;t given him an answer, I&rsquo;ve just been asking questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">To my mind this is clearly a commercial (for profit) use of your work rather than academic one. In my experience, in these instances the publishers themselves negotiate fees/acknowledgements rather than the authors. Could it be that the author is building the content and then the publisher will negotiate a potential fee with you?</div>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t be so sure about fee. Anyway, I’d say yes. If you think this is going to be good for your résumé, accept. This is the best reason – maybe the only one.</p>
<p>A coffee table book is always a pretty, impressive book. In addition, you say it’s a major publisher, so it’s going to be (hopefully) everywhere and therefore it’s going to be watched by many people (free publicity, as James says). And your poster will be among other great designs. It’s like saying, “See?, this people think I’m good on my job, just as good as the other rockstars included here!”</p>
<p>I’d go for it, for sure.</p>

<p>Yes, the book is going to be like the rock star book Ricardo linked to. I emailed the author and inquired about the publisher negotiating fees with artists, but I also let him know I was very interested in being part of the book and a fee wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a deal breaker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read up on his bio, and I have no reason to think he&rsquo;s inclined to pull the wool over my eyes. I found stuff online that he&rsquo;s written about professional ethics and artist survival. So, I decided to simply trust he&rsquo;s not likely to profiteer off the work of graphic artists. If there is no cash forthcoming from the publisher, I&rsquo;ll simply give the author permission for the PR.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post the end of the story when I know.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I still say the best fee is a free copy of the book. If it is a coffee table work, then it will be priced in the $50 to $100 range. If there are 186 contributions, they won&rsquo;t be paying all that much more than $100 anyway to the contributors. 186 x 100 = $18,600, a lot more than most publishers will pay for permissions.</p>
<p>And if you have the free copy, then it becomes a great part of your portfolio (although perhaps a bit much to lug around).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you have a clear idea of how your poster will be described? If the author is big on professional ethics and artist survival, you probably don&rsquo;t have to worry. But I&rsquo;d make sure he&rsquo;s going to say something nice about it, if anything at all. You wouldn&rsquo;t want the poster to be held up as a bad example of something. :-)</div>
