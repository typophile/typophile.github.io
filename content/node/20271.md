body: 'Specifically, a logotype is defined as only the typographical portion of any
  unique or [[logo]], although confusion amongst the definition of this term is rather
  prominent today. The logotype can be presented as a separate entity from its accompanying
  mark, and may function independently from a graphic or pictogram. A prominent example
  of this term would be that of the FedEx logotype, which serves as the main vehicle
  for branding and advertising for FedEx. '
