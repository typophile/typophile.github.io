  a week or 10 before posting, I thought I'd jump right in and rummage around in the
  basement for something to 'donate'....to placate the flamers, as it were.\r\n\r\nSo
  I found this font I designed wayback but never 'fontified', that I thought I'd post
  and see what people thought."

    than General Discussion (for future reference, but a mod will surely move it!).
    Also if you upgrade to Flash 8 you can insert images into your posts rather than
    attaching them as such.\r\n\r\nWhat was your intention with this? I'd like to
    hear more before I say anything about your design."

  body: "Intention? I guess I was interested in designing a gothic/industrial looking
    typeface that wasn't so heavy. I also like the idea of individual letters that
    are constructed using 'generic' elements.\r\n\r\nAs for the intention of the typeface,
    it would be cool if someone was interested in it enough to run it through Fontographer
    or whatever so it could be used as an actual typable font. That's something that's
    not currently within my capabilities, but something I'd like to see happen in
    some capacity."

  body: I'm just not sure about all those circular cuts in the glyphs, at some points
    they act as an ink trap would (which works?) but at other times it just seems
    random. You've got lots of glyphs that are just copies of each other, flipped
    ie. the s and the z, p and the q etc. If you examine other faces you'll find that
    this is not the case. This practice seems to give your idea a rather bland/haphazard
    feel to it. What does this look like without all those random cuts in it? That
    might be worth pursuing.

    talk around these parts. Developming a decent font into an \"actual typable\"
    condition takes, what?, a few hundred hours? Not quite as simple as \"run[ning]
    it through Fontographer or whatever...\""

  body: "I think with a an increased contrast in the strokes this might be pretty
    sweet. The question is Asian brush contrast or western nib?  \r\n\r\nAlso specifically
    - the 2579 f & s all have some form issues.. The 2 5 and s have a crossbar that's
    unfortunate. It needs thinking through. Also the f is just too programatic. It
    draws on the font's formula for it's solution to too great an extent. \r\n\r\nThe
    age in which this might have been a really popular/fashionable font is over -
    but if you want to finnish it I would encourage you. There is enough here that's
    worthwhile to give it a go. If I really like the direction I might even be willing
    to 'fontify it'  - maybe."
