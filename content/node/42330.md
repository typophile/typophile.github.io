body: "Responded to a Craigslist ad this week for a graphic designer. Man on the phone
  sounded a little distracted and there were voices in the background, but he eventually
  said that he had a lot of projects on hand that I could work on, and I should come
  downtown and talk to him.\r\n\r\nSo yesterday afternoon I went downtown to his office.\r\n\r\nThe
  man I'd spoken to wasn't there and nobody knew where he was, but I talked to someone
  else.\r\n\r\nIt came out in the course of our rather casual brief chat (he was typing
  on the computer and talking to other folks the whole time) that they were building
  porn sites, and wanted someone to help work on the front end for a database of \"girls\"
  available for various roles and purposes.\r\n\r\nI did wish I'd been told before
  going that it was a question of adult entertainment. I have no moral imperative
  against the existence of porn, but I've found that the atmosphere around this world
  is not good, tending towards a lack of respect and reliability (viz. making an appointment
  with me then forgetting it the next day).\r\n\r\nMore CVs out today."

  body: When I lived in Chicago I answered an ad for a graphic designer that turned
    out to be for Vivid Video, which was/is a major porn company. They were looking
    for someone to design slipcases for VHS tapes and the like. I interviewed with
    the office manager, and she said "after a while it's like auto parts." I didn't
    take the job, partly because I wouldn't know what to tell my mother, and partly
    because I didn't want to get as jaded and burned out as that office manager seemed
    to be.

  body: "I see a lot of ads for porn jobs here in DC. I think they\u2019re up front
    about it because they usually want someone to do really low-class art for really
    freaky porn. Craiglist makes me very happy to be an in-house designer at a nice
    professional organization. \r\n\r\nThe problem with porn is that it\u2019s a context
    where tasteful design is usually bad design. It would be like doing design for
    Wal-Mart. That and I\u2019m pretty sure it would be hard to get used to coked-up
    porno girls running around topless."

    money, and her first placement was at a printer. Her job was to insert the pornographic
    magazine subscription cards into the pornographic magazines on the assembly line.
    \r\n\r\nAnd she got carpal tunnel syndrome from it to boot!"
