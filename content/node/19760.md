  body: "I sure wish fonts were like an album $10 a pop.\r\n\r\nThat would let me
    experiment beyond the mundane.\r\n(Produce better design and pay some font creators,
    nonetheless).\r\n\r\nI know, you get what you pay for.\r\n"

      a side of carrots, for instance.\r\n\r\nA font family would be the meal. = Big
      Bucks!"

  body: Can't make bucks with an album -- a good type family repays itself with all
    the killer designs you can produce with it. It's a tool, allowing you to earn
    money.

  body: 'Yeah I''d agree that the concept of a font being a tool is a better analogy
    than something like an album or a meal. (Although, you can continue to listen
    to the album more than once.) You create with the tools that you have in your
    toolbox, whether your pencil, pen, rapidiograph, font, computer, etc. '

  body: Indeed, you can continue to listen to the album more than once, but does that
    increase your income? The purchase of a font license has a direct and noticeable
    impact on your work.

  body: 'My take on this is: you earn a living thanks to somebody else''s work, it''s
    normal that person benefits from this, same as you''d pay a photographer, an illustrator,
    a litographer, whoever allows you to do better-looking work. It''s pretty straightforward
    if you ask me.'
