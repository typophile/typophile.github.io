  It's for a cocktail bar, to be used as both signage and logo. I'm trying to portray
  a classic feel to the bar, but with contemporary ideologies. Any comments would
  be greatly appreciated. The colours are not final as the end thing will be a photograph
  with fruit and other bar related objects showing through the lettering. Thank you
  for your time!"

    intended to shape a cocktail glass. \r\nThe little umbrella appears floating,
    more than leaning against the glass or sticking out from something inside."

    gut-reaction comments:\r\n\r\n - the weight of the X's strokes are too thick compared
    to the other letterforms\r\n - the banners/ribbons are distracting rather than
    enhancing\r\n - the umbrella isn't matching stylistically. Maybe go with something
    that can be rendered a bit more iconically (olives?)"

    contemporary cocktail bar and is unlikely to serve martinis, so have to go with
    something other than olives!  like the placement of the type though, do you think
    the x carries the glass shape well enough on its own without being segmented?\r\n\r\nriccard0,
    mostra nuova is perfect, very 20's Italia!\r\n\r\nthanks."

    see that it does, what I was trying to do was represent the Bowl of Hygeia.  I
    have changed it now and gone back to the original name (a variation on). I know
    I previously said no olives, however it seems to work better in all sizes than
    other symbols.\r\nCrits appreciated, [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-23_4545.jpg]"

    or \"V\"  used like a glass is a little bit overused as solution to convey the
    \"cocktail\" feeling. If you want to stick to the Twenties,here are few suggestions
    for typefaces you could try (in addiction to a wisely used Futura, maybe condensed
    due to the length of the name):\r\n\r\nNeutraface\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface\r\n\r\nVerlag\r\nhttp://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009\r\n\r\n\r\nCould

    think you need to start from a strong concept. I'd want the name settled for definite
    and a clear idea of the style of bar. 'Classic and contemporary' doesn't mean
    anything to me. What era is 'classic' anyway? Ask questions like what is the client
    demographic? What is the atmosphere going to be like? What sort of music? Until
    this is clear, the graphic elements are not coherent. And stay away from fruit
    showing through...can you read the yellow-on-white italics in your example?"
