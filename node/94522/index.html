  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I admire this book jacket by Chip Kidd. The layout and typeface, Corvinus Skyline by Imre Renner, convey a sense of power in restraint that perfectly suits this work by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The letters march in a pace that is measured but by no means static. The jacket is a gem.

I find it totally lacking harmony and good proportion.

		<div class="commentbody">Frank U. Finkelstein, I agree. The thin bits of the letter shapes begin to dissolve and the one point perspective formed by the top and bottom text blocks become too dominant. Somber grey tones with the 'busy' imagery make to the whole composition weary. All-in-all I doubt that Breyer is neither weary nor spaced out, lol.  

And adding to that, his opinions are clearly worded.

I think this Kidd's jacket is more about creating a one point perspective - as in - Breyer's one point perspective on democracy as a whole, and sacrificed the integral elements of the letter shapes to do so. Which is rather ironic.

For books that are marketed and sold on the internet, a thumbnail is all many buyers see before they order the book on-line or before they walk into the bookstore to buy or order the book there. That thumbnail version (smaller than the one at the top of this thread) is what sells (or doesn't sell) the book.

The thumbnail is the cover, and deserves its own review. You may not like that, but this is the way we live now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You buy books based on thumbnails of their covers? Isn't there a proverb about not judging a book by (a thumbnail of) its cover?

I think the notion of reviewing thumbnails of book covers is stupid.

		<div class="commentbody">That’s not true.
The design of the cover gives the reader important cues as to what sort of a book is inside.
When I was working for Harlequin, I discovered that there were many sub-genres of women’s ﬁction, e.g. Historical, Humorous, Erotic, Chicklit, etc., and these each had a corresponding style of cover.
Whether the author’s name or the title is more prominent tells you how well known the author is.
How “clever” the concept is counts too.
When working for Jim Lorimer, he would set up prospective book covers on a pseudo-bookstore shelf, and see what they looked like from afar: not thumbnails per se, but a corresponding angle of vision. The book had to make a good ﬁrst impression, across a crowded store, and get noticed enough for someone to pick it up and read the blurb, and perhaps open it and read the contents page or a few paragraphs.

I’m surprised the brilliant Mr Kidd designed this dreary, unimaginative cover, though it is well-crafted and presumably on the money. (Perhaps he designed a really cool concept, but the client would have none of it?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I'm not debating that a cover can provide useful information, especially when part of a differentiated series from a publisher, as in the Harlequin example you give. What I am saying is that thumbnails of designs are not a worthwhile subject of <em>design critique,</em> especially not at the level of type stroke contrast as was happening in this discussion (the hairlines of the type in the image are greying out, whereas in the real object they would have the same stroke density as the main stems). I suppose one can make some general comments about concept and layout, but even there is is difficult to judge the real impact of the physical object from a small, low-res pixelated image.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Right, it’s not the kind of thing that would belong in a “best of” selection by the best book jacket designer of our time, e.g.
http://www.amazon.com/Chip-Kidd-Monographics-Veronique-Vienne/dp/0300099525/ref=pd_sim_b_4
His designs are generally quite dramatic, with clever concepts.
This Breyer book has a tombstone layout, and no concept!
—which is plain to see, even in a thumbnail. 

However, given the serious content of the book, perhaps it was decided that a “creative” cover was counterproductive. As Bob Gill put it when discussing such content, you shouldn’t get creative if your text is “Cure for cancer discovered”.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ Frank and Neil: In the early 90s, you used to see a lot of wide letterspacing used with condensed fonts. Quark xPress was everybody's new toy, and they were letterspacing because Quark made it easy, not because it was the best design solution. At the time, I hated it. I thought making the type skinny and then putting wide spaces in it was like running the air conditioner with the windows open.

I guess I've mellowed with the passing years. Now I look at a book jacket like this and think, "That's not how I would have done it, but you know, it works."</div>

In fact, as a substantial trend it began in the UK in the mid 1980s, as a reaction against the status quo of tight ﬁtting.
