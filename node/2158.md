body: I&#39;ve been wondering, has anybody discerned the logic &#40;assuming it wasn&#39;t
  formally documented in the first place&#41; of the Petrine reform of Cyrillic at
  the beginning of the 18th century? Like why was the cap U &#40;the one that looks
  like a big Latin lc &#34;y&#34;&#41; left/made into a form different than the Latin
  cap &#34;Y&#34;&#42;, while something like the EM was made totally Latin? Was there
  some system to it? <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode?

  body: 'Have you read Vladimir Yefimov&#39;s essay on the Petrine Civil Type in <i>Language
    Culture Type</i>? It doesn&#39;t directly address the capital U question, but
    it does provide a fairly detailed history of the reform. Of course, at the final
    stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff:
    alphabet reform by royal fiat, and I don&#39;t suppose the Tsar felt any need
    to explain himself. <BR> <BR>You might also track down volumes 3:4 &#40;1969&#41;
    and 4:2 &#40;1970&#41; of the journal <i>Visible Language</i>, which contain a
    two-part essay on &#39;The Genesis of Russian Grazhdanskii Shrift or Civil Type&#39;
    by Ivan L. Kaldor. I don&#39;t have my copies to hand, so I can&#39;t check what
    information they might include about the alphabet reform. Kaldor was principally
    interested in identifying the specific Latin types on which the Civil Type was
    based. <BR> <BR><i>BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode?</i> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    used in the Cyrillic orthographies of Azerbaijani, Bashkir and Kalmyk. Take a
    look at the lowercase form, U&#43;04AF. I&#39;m not sure when this developed.
    All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s
    and 1930s, until Stalin decided that the USSR should be a Cyrillic-only zone.
    But if you take a look at the images at <a href="http://www.pmicro.kz/~library/unicode/index.html">this
    site</a>, taken from M.I. Isaev&#39;s <i>Yazykovoe strointel&#39;stvo v SSSR</i>,
    you&#39;ll see that the &#39;Y&#39; is shown with a typical Russian U form. It
    is difficult to tell whether this represents the form used for these languages
    in the 1920s and 1930s or if this was simply what Isaev had available in 1979.'

    <BR>Good thinking, would have saved me a lot of trouble. <BR> <BR>I would be interested
    in reading the essay, <i>Petrine Civil Type.</i>

  body: Obviously, I haven&#39;t read Yefimov&#39;s chapter yet. :-/ <BR>I&#39;ll
    have to bump it up my reading list... In fact I can make it second in line &#40;after
    part 3 of that Ovink thing&#41;, not least because Typophile threads get &#34;closed&#34;
    after a month of inactivity... <BR> <BR>And thanks for the VL references. I recently
    finished &#34;mining&#34; Quaerendo all the way back to the beginning, and VL/JoTR
    can be next. Long live UCLA! Well, at least their libraries... <BR> <BR>&#62;
    at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile
    of stuff <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what I suspected. But I guess the preparatory stuff
    by &#34;advisors&#34; did guide the process to a large extent &#40;at least I
    hope so&#41;. Nonetheless, what might be called the erratic, &#34;human&#34; nature
    of the process probably resulted in some strangeness. For example, for the cap
    U, I wonder if Peter saw a lc Latin &#34;y&#34;, and since it&#39;s &#34;tall&#34;
    he thought it was a cap, and he just took a fancy to it? But this is mostly just
    my imagination for now - I&#39;ll read up that material soon. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;
    04AE <BR>&#62; Take a look at the lowercase form <BR> <BR>Huh, it looks like a
    van Krimpen Greek gamma. <BR> <BR>&#62; All three languages were written in variants
    of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s <BR> <BR>It seems that this is what
    would have made them used a more Latin form, although <BR>that lc is still strange
    - maybe it was to differentiate it from the mainstream/Russian form. <BR> <BR>hhp

    they&#39;re different letters in a single orthography. All three languages use
    this straight-leg form <i>and</i> the typical Cyrillic U. In the new Azerbaijani
    Latin orthography &#40;1992&#41;, the latter is written <i>u</i> while the straight-leg
    letter is written as <i>&uuml;</i>. I&#39;m not sure of the exact phonetic value.

  body: Oh, OK - that explains the lc form. <BR>I wonder why they didn&#39;t just
    use an accent, since they have accents for other letters. But maybe it&#39;s better
    this way. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    the Arabic script, Azerbaijani uses letters as vowels, not Arabic vocalisation

    vowels discussed above, <i>u</i> and <i>&uuml;</i>, as well as the vowels <i>o</i>

  body: The Cyrillic orthographies for these languages don&#39;t use any floating
    accent marks, except those that occur in the Russian orthography &#40;<i>Ie</i>
    with diaeresis and the short sign on the <i>I</i>&#41;. These orthographies all
    used newly invented letters for non-Russian sounds.

    switch to Latin a few years ago? I&#39;d guess they&#39;ve modeled the switch
    on the Turkish precedent. But is Cyrillic still the de facto script? I remember
    that the switch was seen as a long-shot political ploy; which was in fact the
    case with Turkish, although having a strong leader -and the high illiteracy back
    then- made that one more effective. <BR> <BR>In fact here&#39;s a story: <BR><a

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the current state of play is in Azerbaijan. My guess
    is that the two scripts co-exist, with the Latin being given preference in schools
    and in all official publications.
