body: Hello.  I've found this sample of a script that I really like, however it has
  proven difficult to identify.  Someone suggested that it is not a font at all, but
  rather hand drawn.  I have been directed to P22Corinthia and Annabelle-JF as similar
  fonts.  Am wondering if anyone here may have any other possibilities as to either
  the identity, if it is actually a font, or other similiar ones.  Thank you in advance
  for any help.

  body: Hi all.  Don't want to be a pest, but just wanted to bump this pretty little
    "font?" up again.  Thank you for any help you might be able to offer regarding
    it or anything more that might be similar.  Best regards.

  body: Did you download this image from a website? You should try contacting them
    to ask whoever made it. I could not find it on Veer or House Industries, and those
    were my first inclinations ... It is quite nice, though!

  body: Yes, thank you, I did try Mike's Script ID first.  He's the one that sent
    me here =), also the one that suggested P22Corinthia which is quite similar.  I
    actually found the sample on the DaFont forum as a question to them (so I don't
    know where the original came from).  No answer there tho, and I really liked the
    font, so thot I'd do some research myself. No success, so asked Mike... and here
    I am!  Thanks to you all for trying to find something for me.  I really appreciate
    it. Someone at MyFonts forum said they thought it was hand drawn.  Probably correct
    as it seems to not exist anywhere.  So I guess now I'm just looking for other
    similar fonts.  The two mentioned above are good ones, just wondering if there
    are others.  Thanks again for all your help.

  body: "My impulse was originally (and still) that this may have been the work of
    Rob Leuschke. Several of his fonts, besides \"Corinthia\" have somewhat similar
    letterforms, and it seems consistent with 'calmer' examples of his style. I checked
    his web sites for Alphabytes and TypeSetit, but he never used 'Gallery' there.
    \r\n\r\nThe other calligrapher-font designer whose style might cover this is Hermann
    Zapf, but this seems very unlikely to me. (I was thinking about some of the variations
    in Zapfino, but the \"Gallery' lettering is less flamboyant than the Zapfino style,
    in my way of looking at it.)\r\n\r\nI'm afraid this one remains a mystery, at
    least for now.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
