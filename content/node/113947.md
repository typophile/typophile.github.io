  body: "Thanks Fivos for the pointer to Legrand. I found the Rick Mueller and \"Font
    Shop 1999\" digitizations at \"free\" sites as well as a pointer to a digitization
    by Gerald Gallo being sold under the name Display Art Three http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/display-art-three/
    Identifont and the major font vendors are blank for Legrand.\r\nThey seem to be
    independent digitizations of the same source.  The Gallo version has a slightly
    more finished quality than the Mueller, but has far fewer glyphs. The Fontshop
    1999 is of poorer quality. \r\nDon"
