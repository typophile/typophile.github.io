body: Somehow I have a feeling that of the European scripts, the Latin and Armenian
  scripts can't be the only one with a typographical history of [[ligature|ligatures]].  Are
  there any common ligatures in Cyrillic/Georgian/Greek scripts?  Or any common ligatures
  in Latin/Armenian other than the standard ones defined in the [[Unicode]] spec (in
  addition to other semi-common ligatures like fj, ct, ck, it, ip)?

    make it really difficult for me to read Greek manuscripts from that era. Adaptation
    to the typographic age must have had something to do with the fact that we don't
    see them so much anymore.\r\n\r\nNowadays in Greek typography, I think ligatures
    serve mainly an aesthetic function rather than arising from scribal shorthand;
    some ligatures I see are for double lambda or double gamma and the like."

  body: "Nick, sorry, somehow I read \"Greek printers\" where you'd simply written
    \"printers\"! So I would instead say: yes that must have had something to do with
    it, on the other hand the difficulty of setting ligated Greek was no easier in
    the age of Granjon, but those guys simply hadn't fallen for the charms of Simplification.
    Over-simplification, in my book. Difficult things (like making fonts!) are quite
    often worth the effort. And Complexity is sometimes just the ticket.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "ChrisL: <cite>The double lamda and double gamma are perhaps the most prevalent
    of Greek ligatures.</cite>\r\n\r\nRight. But should they be stowed under \"standard\"
    ligatures? Probably not. They occur in medial positions only in Greek and can
    often appear at hyphenation break points. Depending on character design, other
    commonly doubled consonants that are candidates for ligation include: double mu,
    double sigma, double pi, double rho, and double nu. However, since none of these
    doubled consonants are found in initial occurrence in Greek (except, perhaps,
    in some transliterated \"loan words\" from foreign languages &mdash; though even
    that seems a stretch too far), the same hyphenation caveat would appear to apply.
    The upshot, then? At best, these all seem candidates for \"discretionary\" ligatures,
    not \"standard\" alongside fi, ff, ffl, and so on.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nErnie\r\n\r\n"

    Well, good for Adobe and their users. What about QuarkXPress/Passport and other
    apps? What's the status there? \r\n\r\nIn any case, do you feel such Greek ligatures
    merit inclusion under \"standard\" (liga) or \"discretionary\" (dlig) or perhaps
    as contextual alternates (calt)? I'd opt for \"discretionary\" unless wiser counsel
    chimes in (e.g., John Hudson, Adam Twardoch, Gerry Leonidas).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nErnie\r\n\r\n"
