  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Everybody,

I'm currently a student studying Graphic Design and I've been given Apple's Chalkboard typeface to research. So far I have come up with not a lot apart that apple commissioned its design and it was launched in 2003 packaged with Mac OS X Panther.

I have hence turned to the guru's of Type to ask for some pointers. Does anybody know the following:-

Who actually designed Chalkboard?

Is there any special reason behind the typeface's name apart from the hand written black board writing?

What is the taxonomy of this typeface, Sans, transitional or what what? Where can I find info on typeface taxonomy?

Does anybody have any suggestions of what typefaces would work in harmony with Chalkboard and which ones in your opinion will totally clash?

Is there any history behind this typeface?

Thanks for your help,

Regards,

Tim</div>

Good to hear that Aussie graphic design teachers haven't lost their sense of humor. 

As you're unlikely to get much information on its design you might want to take a look at the relationship between it and other similar typefaces.

Cheers, Si</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim, Chalkboard is an homage to the hugely successful Comic Sans.

This kind of plagiarism is legal in North America, as there is apparently no "point piracy" involved (but you could do a comparison of physical parameters). Technically it may be illegal in Europe.

No self-respecting type foundry or designer would put their name to it, but Big Silicon can publish this font without damaging its reputation; Apple has no qualms about doing to Microsoft what Microsoft has done several times to others, most notoriously its copy of Palatino. 
Also, there is no general outrage, because Comic Sans is a much despised face--so again, there is a double standard.
The fact that this is a free (bundled) font may also effect the optics, further lessening the stigma.

However, despite Comic Sans and Chalkboard being "infra dig" with professional designers, Chalkboard has never acquired the cachet of Comic Sans, even amongst Mac users. The why of this may be worth pursuing; is it not as good a design, or does being a sequel to a well established face prejudice against it aesthetically? </div>

That saying has been mixed into 3 rave songs from today's BBC 6 Music George Lamb show taken from tuesday 11 Aug 09 broadcast. Today's podcast isn't live yet but will be soon.
