body: Hi, <BR>Ive recently had alot of trouble with panther. I had to make a clean
  install and create a back up of my work. I forgot to copy my atm control panel.
  &#40;the original installer is long gone&#41; and now i cant get atm deluxe to work
  properly. it says to make sure i have atm in the control panel and that it is ON
  in the preference dialog.  <BR>How could i get another ATM control panel, and is
  this the problem. I just copied the application folder.  <BR>I have the atm preferences
  and manager sets in the preferences folder. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any help.

  body: Hi Grant, <BR>Thanks for the reply and offer of help but ive since realised
    the control panel has little to do with this. <BR>Im having huge trouble with
    my laptop and its quite scary because ive alot of work to do and since ive gotton
    panther its lost control. <BR>Ill explain it all because im hoping somebody can
    give some advice that may help fix this. I firstly installed panther, upgrade,
    then anytime i tryed open an application it said &#34;unexpectedly quit&#34;.
    I had to erase the disk and make a clean install. I also installed 9.2, for quark.
    when i tryed organising fonts with fontbook, the machine got alot slower. When
    I would try open font book the rainbow spiral just kept spinning. iCal was the
    same and when i tryed to click &#34;accounts&#34; in the preferences window. I
    went to an apple place they just got me to install panther again, gave me new
    discs and it all seemed ok again until i tryed sort my fonts and it all happened
    again.  <BR>Another clean install later. Trying to forget about fontbook, i just
    put my essential fonts in harddrive/library/fonts then the computer wouldnt start
    the same spiral on the desktop waiting for the folders to dissapear. Ive since
    started up on my os 9 cd and removed the fonts from the library and it all works
    fine.  <BR>Has anyone an idea why? <BR>and is there a problem with putting too
    many fonts in the library, i put about 50. would it be safer to put the fonts
    in the application fonts folder. the laptop is an ibook about 1.5 years old. <BR>Thanks
    for any help, <BR>david.

    Font Book. You might want to read about his plight and how he managed to get things
    working again. It may help. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.cacomixl.com/blog/2003_11_01_archive.html#106833576659861355"

    <BR> <BR> I have yet to migrate to Panther, but I&#39;ll probably keep using SuitCase
    XI rather than Font Book, seeing as I have several thousand typefaces to manage.
    As far as I&#39;m concerned, Font Book ain&#39;t ready for large-scale prime time
    type libraries.

  body: grant your a star, thanks ill read this now, i figure the best thing to do
    is just put the fonts in the library when i start and delete them when im finished.
    im ready to throw this thing out the window.

  body: Regardless of what else is going on, I&#39;ll note that ATM Deluxe is officially
    &#42;not&#42; compatible with OS X. &#40;ATM Light can still be run in Classic,
    and is pretty useful there.&#41; <BR> <BR>Some people have reported success using
    ATM Deluxe in OS X as long as they turn off auto-activation. Of course, it&#39;s
    still a Classic app, so you have to run Classic to run it. But you&#39;re taking
    your chances if you choose to go this route. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR>

  body: I have to admit that I do run ATMD in Classic - mind you, not for font management
    as Thomas mentions above - but for sample printing. The type index and sample
    templates built into SuitCase are teetering on this side of atrocious. &#40;ATMD
    is active for cross-OS compatibility testing too, of course.&#41;

  body: What bothers me, is Panther is less than a month old and they already had
    an update 10.3.1, not a good sign. To manage fonts I use Font Reserve, it works
    with OS 10. Dan

    that a bad sign. I find that comforting. Any software manufacturer &#40;Apple,
    Microsoft, whomever...&#41; that can identify serious issues and patch them within
    a week of a major release is on the ball in my book. Yes, it would have been better
    if the issues had been caught prior to the release of Panther, but we&#39;re talking
    about a massive ball consisting of several thousand chunks of code and individual
    programs which make up an operating system. Given the complexity of the end product,
    I&#39;m impressed they were able to release 10.3.1 as quickly as they did. You
    don&#39;t often see an Adobe or a Macromedia fixing issues that fast.'
