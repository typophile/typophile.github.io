  body: "Good evening,\r\nor whatever time it is when you read my comment...\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is:\r\ntwo dozend of Antiqua were built between, lets say,\r\n1900 up
    to 1920. All called with a name part like\r\n\"Roman\" (R\xF6mische or Romanische).
    They all look\r\na little bit the same way.\r\n\r\nThis one shows some typical
    signs like the lower \r\ncase \"e\" or the upper case \"A\", not to forget the\r\nspecial
    \"R\" rounding (this is typical for those\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nThe best source \"Seemann
    - Handbuch f\xFCr Schriften\"\r\nis not senseful to use because they used the
    word\r\n\"Hamburg\" or \"Hamburger\". But not in this case,\r\nI checked it.\r\n\r\nIts
    a typography book, mh?\r\nIt tells something about form and spirit (Ausdruck).\r\nCan
    you tell me in which year the book was printed?\r\nOr the title and author? That
    makes it easier to find\r\nit. Is it printed in Leipzig e.g.? So it could be a\r\nSchriftguss
    or Schelter & Giesecke type. \r\n\r\nYou see... I'ld like to help, but I'ld need
    your support.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

    magazine G, edited by El Lissitzy, Werner Graeff and Hans Richter in the early
    1920s. The typeface is a little bit like Italia in structure, but different in
    many details.\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n"
