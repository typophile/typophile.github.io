<p>The short answer is no, I don&rsquo;t think there is a way to do this.</p>
<p>The results of gridfitting are size-specific, so at best you would get an outline correspondence at one size only. Delta hints are expressed, obviously, as deltas to the unadjusted position, not as target point positions. You are saying &lsquo;Move this point a distance from its current position&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Move this point to this location&rsquo;, and since the delta technology was designed to turn whole pixels on or off the units are quite crude. Even if you knew exactly what the target position was, in xy coordinates from your alternate outline, the chance of being able to hit it precisely with hinting is very remote, unless that alternate outline had been designed very precisely for a particular ppem size.</p>
<p>I think Sergej is right, and what you are looking for is outline substitution. No idea if that is possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure. But how does this make it impossible?
You measure the difference between the points,
and you move the Main points by that amount.</p>
<p>Also: Deltas are applied per PPEM, right? So, just like you
do in 1-bit, you have sets of deltas that make a glyph come
out right for each point size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>unless that alternate outline had been
designed very precisely for a particular ppem size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has.
It&rsquo;s designed to 1/4 pixels in each dimension.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>since the delta technology was designed to turn whole pixels on or off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I was pretty sure that it was ammended to address partial pixels, no?</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m describing can be done manually, I&rsquo;m pretty sure.
The question is, how hard would it be to automate it based
on a explicit outline pair? In the worst case, a low-level
utility would have to be written to do with the TT code as
it pleases (which would be too much work, unless somebody
were to process truck-loads of such fonts). In the best case, I
suspect Python could be made to splice in the needed hints, no?</p>

I&rsquo;d rather not get into outline subbing though.</p>
<p>OK, let me ask this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can&rsquo;t you use something like VTT to take the Main font, choose a PPEM, and manually move the points so you get the points of the Alternate?</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t this difference information be extracted from comparing the two outlines?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer to both those is Yes, shouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to write some code that takes the Main font, observes its differences with the Alternate font, is given a PPEM, and with all that info generates a font like I&rsquo;m saying?</p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tt/ttf_spec/ttch06b.doc">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tt/ttf_spec/ttch06b.doc</a></p>
<p>Also the instruction I was thinking of before was &lsquo;FLIPPT[]&rsquo; Flip point which will make an on curve point an off curve point and the other way around. That way you don&rsquo;t have curves just straight lines everywhere, easier to put on grid boundries.</p>
<p>The TrueType instruction set was not designed to do what you are asking. But you can, at a certain PPEM use one CVT (control value) for small sizes (using MIAP and setting it to not look at the cut-in limit), an X height for instance, and then use a smaller one for larger print sizes. You could also move points or use larger CVT values to thicken up the stems at smaller sizes.</p>
<p>But using instructions in a heavy handed way is always dangerous since they might not get used by some devices. (like some printers)</p>
<p>TrueType has the ability to manipulate outlines using a matrix but its implementation doesn&rsquo;t always support this. Ie. Hp Deskjets back in the early 1990&rsquo;s couldn&rsquo;t handle flipped glyphs or scaled glyphs. In theory the SOFFSET let&rsquo;s you skew, scale, or flip. FontLab will output a composite in TTF using the SOFFSET if you flip or scale it.</p>

<p>BTW, why such a fine scale? I thought Windows (for one) uses
only 16 shades of gray when rendering gs fonts, which would
mean 1/4 pixels (in each dimension) should be enough, no?</p>

<p>But if they&rsquo;re ignored, what&rsquo;s the worst that can happen?
Won&rsquo;t you just get what you were going to anyway, like in
the case of bitmap tuning you&rsquo;d revert to the fuzzy stuff.</p>
<p>Or are you saying that some instructions wouldn&rsquo;t
work but some would so you&rsquo;d get a hodge-podge?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the CVT that controls curve widths I see.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all looking possible, eh?</p>
<p>Now, what would it take to automate this, and tweak the CVTs using data
from the differences between two (outline-compatible) outline fonts?</p>

<p>You could use embedding bitmaps</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually a big fan of embedded bitmaps, and have a few fonts that way, like Arasan*. But besides the fact that they don&rsquo;t work on MacOS**, the critical thing is that they don&rsquo;t handle grayscale bitmaps. Or actually, I&rsquo;ve been told they do, but after trying for a while I had to give up. In my best effort I did get grays, but they were totally off in value. On the other hand, I was using a beta of BitFonter, and maybe the later versions made some fix? I asked the Pyrus boys about this a few times a while back, but never got a convincing reply (which is pretty rare for them).</p>

<p>You can use VTT functions that were used for grey or binary to do CT delta like hinting. But you have to add to one of the functions and know the settings and add to the function.</p>
<p>CVTs are control values. You use them for heights or stem widths. So you could in theory thicken up all the stems at small sizes for small text use and increase the xheight but then use others for normal text sizes.</p>

<p>none would work or all would. example: Bitstream&rsquo;s Font Fusion has modes so it sometimes might not use the hints. It depends how it&rsquo;s set up. 
<a href="http://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/font_fusion/ffoverview.html">http://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/font_fusion/ffoverview.html</a></p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t read between fonts. The code in the font is internal. What you want to do is outside of the scope of a font file. It&rsquo;s part of the rasterizer or a state engine.</p>
<p>QuickDraw GX supported morphing images. In 1992 at the Apple Safari Erik and Just showed Trixie being tweeked to be lighter or darker depending if the ribbon was new or old.</p>
<p>I morped a symbol USA font to change into fire krackers. This was done by QuickDraw GX and very useless.</p>
<p>OpenType was to solve more serious problems such as ones in languages. It was decided that solving Asian font issues, for instance was more important than if you could make an &lsquo;A&rsquo; thicker.</p>

<p>Sure. In fact I&rsquo;d be shocked if a font could like contain
two fonts, take measurements between them, adjust itself, etc.</p>
<p>Like I said at the very beginning, what I&rsquo;d like is an external
app/utility, but maybe hopefully just Python code, that creates
a new font with its &ldquo;custom&rdquo; hinting, based on the input of a
general font and a PPEM-specific font (the two outline-compatible).</p>
<p>So if you think it&rsquo;s doable, what would it take, effort-wise?</p>

<p>non linear hinting of widths has been a part of TrueType since the beginning. Bitmaps are often on larger widths at small sizes than they would be if it&rsquo;s width value was calculated for that size linearly.</p>
<p>when we made Tahoma I had to support Matthew Carter and Tom Rickner by giving them (or Matthew) the escapements for some of the core bitmap fonts that were part of Windows, (I made most of the original bitmaps for Tahoma for Windows). The old system bitmap fonts (like all) do not scale linearly ie. the &lsquo;space&rsquo; might be 3 pixels at 9ppem, 4 pixels at 10ppem, then 3 at 11ppem. Often the &lsquo;l&rsquo; or &lsquo;i&rsquo; needs to be more than 1 pixel wide or it crashes with other characters and doesn&rsquo;t centre so you make it&rsquo;s width one bigger.</p>
<p>the &lsquo;hdmx&rsquo; is there to speed up line layout. Also there is always some give and take in page layout the screen is just a representation of the printed page and simulates a point size.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Tahoma was the regular weight font and was made first, Verdana was the bold. Verdana was originally called Ohana but that got dropped.</p>
<p>We were trying to replace MS Sans as the UI font in Windows 95 to make it look very different than anything out there (at the last minute!). Changing the UI font was the quickest way to do that.</p>
<p>We had to come as close as possible to MS Sans bitmaps that were in Windows. So somebody has to open up all those bitmaps and come up with numbers and in some cases convert the bitmap fonts so Matthew could use them on his Mac and that was me.</p>
<p>Matthew made the bitmaps and in some cases used negative sidebearings (the bitmap went out of the width). Matthew designs on a Mac.</p>
<p>I had to correct the bitmaps and remake them in the Window SDK tool for making fnt&rsquo;s and then we used those in test Versions of Windows 95. The fnt bitmap format didn&rsquo;t support negative lsb or rsb.</p>
<p>We went through many versions and many system tests (many) and eventually it was not accepted because it was not exactly the same as Ms Sans for the escapements. This would cause massive problems for thousands of applications developers developing for Windows. It also was different than what most people were use to seeing so they thought MS Sans was better (mostly because of the &lsquo;what you read most, reads best theory&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Matthew made the first bitmaps, I made them work.</p>
<p>Eventually I had to calculate the metrics from the bitmaps for the TrueType font then when Matthew made the outline I embedded the bitmaps into the fonts so Tom Rickner could use them to hint the font to get the exact image as the bitmaps.</p>
<p>There were many people involved in the making of Tahoma, we are generally credited in talks about Tahoma as &lsquo;the engineers&rsquo;. We &lsquo;the engineers&rsquo; were trying to maintain backward compatibility and do something different, not just do something different.</p>
<p>Eventually Tahoma got picked up by Office for its dialogs after Internet Explorer shipped with the bolder font Verdana.</p>
<p>I made Trebuchet after/during the hinting of Tahoma. The way the shapes came out largely is caused by making sure at the small sizes the bitmaps were all different than Tahoma. I made the &lsquo;M&rsquo; angled because Tahoma was straight. I used a serif on the &lsquo;l&rsquo; because Tahoma didn&rsquo;t and made the &lsquo;g&rsquo; 2-story since his was one story. I also made my cap height, x-height and ascenders different. At 10 or 11 ppem there is very little difference between one font and another other than the white space and the Cap height. Matthew made his ascenders bigger than his Caps to separate them visually, and made a big x-height.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s keeper trivia right there.
I guess they dumped it because of the potential confusion

<p>I embedded the bitmaps into the fonts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m really curious, assuming you can remember/dig_it_up (I hope so)
what the comparative filesize was between your transitional font and
the final superhinted version. I ask because one classic argument in
support of superhinting versus embedded bitmaps (at least before CT :-)
was filesize. The thing is, the hints in the old MS core fonts took up
fully HALF the file size!! So I&rsquo;m suspicious. Hopefully we can unravel
this once and for all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the bolder font Verdana</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything the first time :-) but are you sure you mean bolder? I mean, Verdana has 1- and 2-pixel stem Regular and Bold fonts just like Tahoma (and I think they &ldquo;break&rdquo; at the same PPEMs). In fact, if anything, Verdana&rsquo;s looser spacing (its [official] raison-d&rsquo;être vis-a-vis Tahoma) makes it slightly lighter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trebuchet&hellip; making sure at the small sizes
the bitmaps were all different than Tahoma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d read that before (but is less detail).
It&rsquo;s an interesting, and to me not invalid, strategy.</p>

I don&rsquo;t think Matthew would like it to be seen since it&rsquo;s very geometric and a work in progress. I do think he has shown this in one of his talks about the face. It looks a bit like his &lsquo;Walker&rsquo; typeface.</p>
<p>The early bitmaps were designed at 8 pixels high (ascender to descender)for the UI font (regular) and 18, 22 pixels height for the test Display font. These really weren&rsquo;t ppem but more cell height of the ascender to descender.</p>
<p>Later there were condensed versions which I embedded into TrueType fonts containing only bitmaps and a single &lsquo;missing glyph&rsquo;. The bitmap fonts only contained A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and a couple of test accents like Aring, and Ccedilla plus basic punctuation so we could test it in the system.</p>
<p>The original font was called MS Sans and compiled into a .fon file with the basic sizes for 96x96 res for testing.</p>
<p>The first use a font named Tahoma was as a bitmap font based on a Display font previously referred to as &lsquo;Ohana&rsquo;. This font was used for Windows 95&rsquo;s start-up screen. It was necessary for it to be a bitmap font since during the install process the operating system is not fully installed and only simple formats could be used. Ohana was a nonsense name made from the two senior leads Virginia Howlett and Dave Ohara.</p>
<p>The first Display test TrueType font; of 299 glyphs (char set &lsquo;Win ANSII&rsquo;; )hinted font with embedded bitmaps for 3 sizes 13, 14, 17 ppem was 77,572 bytes</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s the difference between legibility (where having <cite>anything</cite> is -naturally- better than nothing) and readability (without which you can still read, just not comfortably), with the former always getting more attention because it&rsquo;s much more obvious. The good news is that you could say this is natural evolution, in that complex scripts acquire the basics first, and then they (and Latin as a consequence) move up to more sophisticated things like optical scaling and good bitmaps. On the other hand, there will always be more money (hence development, at least in a capitalistic framework) in legibility than readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hr: BTW, why such a fine scale? I thought Windows (for one) uses
only 16 shades of gray when rendering gs fonts, which would
mean 1/4 pixels (in each dimension) should be enough, no?</p>
<p>TT is overbuilt, typical of a good long-term standard. There also 72 different rounding states possible.</p>
<p>VC: You can’t read between fonts. The code in the font is internal.</p>
<p>Literally, this is true, but you can however pass info and code from one font to another by including, e.g. a Roman cvt stem value in the CVT of the Bold to make sure they&rsquo;ll always be different, or e.g. an identical function acting upon a cascade of cvts.</p>
<p>Fonts can talk to each other through TT, and as long as all other things in the transformation and rasterization of the fonts is =, all&rsquo;s well. The Barriers that stop more from happening are in my original crit of OT.</p>
