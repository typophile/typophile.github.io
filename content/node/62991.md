body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface that has some of the characteristics
  of Sabon, but in bold or semibold condensed caps. A little like Trajan Pro Bold,
  I guess, but quite  bit narrower.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nR"

    BQ</a> has condensed medium and regular weights (regular small caps as well).
    Also, you might want to look <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/trajan/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s
    also <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-trajan/\">Goudy Trajan</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/eason\">Eason</a> (the display
    caps). \r\n\r\nThese are broad suggestions. Would you care to explain what purpose
    you need it to fullfill? That would make it easier to give suggestions."

    asking because it\u2019s easier to find something specific if I know what kind
    of work you are doing. Some of these are very newspaperish, some are more bookish.
    I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever seen any condensed caps true to Trajan.\r\n\r\n"
