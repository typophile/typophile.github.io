  saying - font may be damaged or invalid. This happens with every single OT or PS
  font I try to use. I have tried fonts from my collection and fonts I have downloaded
  to test, same thing every time no matter how I try to install them.\r\n\r\nIm on
  windows xp pro.\r\n\r\nAnyone have an idea what could be going on?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Sounds like the system libraries that process the fonts might be corrupt.
    Try doing a repair install of the OS.

  body: "VERY probably somewhere along the line this computer had ATM installed, and
    never had it upgraded to the latest version and/or cleanly de-installed prior
    to upgrading to Vista. Is that possible? It's kind of famous for causing this
    problem.\r\n\r\nIf so, install the ATM 4.1.2 \"patch,\" which is really a Windows
    registry fix.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "ATM Was installed after I installed XP. Then I un-installed it as I suspected
    it may be causing the problem. Also ran the patch with no luck. Still getting
    error message.\r\n\r\nIm wondering if I clean the registry of all entries of ATM
    if that may help.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks"
