    to do the file conversion.

  body: Generating a font file from Fontographer and importing it into another editor
    will work, but you will lose things like guide and template layer data, and any
    off-grid points may be rounded off to the nearest whole number.

  body: aargh. ok. i will have to open the wallet one more time for foglamp. don't
    wanna lose all the stuff since way back. seems a hassle to find an old komputter
    with fog and generate a font, plus transfer it to my new laptop every time for
    every font. i am just going to start working on yet another weight to malmo sans...

  body: 'One little thing here: FogLamp will round off the off-grid points just the
    same as generating a font file (ttf or ps). The simple fact is FontLab does not
    support off-grid points (neither do ttf or ps). However, FogLamp does give you
    the option of increasing the number of units per em in the resulting vfb, so the
    rounding can be lessened. '
