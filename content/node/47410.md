body: "How much do you charge to design a logo or application icon? Do you charge
  a flat amount?\r\n\r\nThis probably depends on several factors. What factors do
  you consider?\r\n\r\nFor example, if someone contacts you interested in designing
  a logo (or application icon, etc.), how would you respond? What questions would
  you ask?\r\n\r\nI have designed logos for friends and personal projects, but haven't
  had any \"serious\" clients. Please detail your experience or point me toward a
  place to figure this basic stuff out.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "ya, what Al said. Solve for that good hourly rate that you can actually break
    down to your client on paper. No one likes to get a number quoted to them and
    feel like it was just pulled out of thin air. Stick by that hourly rate and chronicle
    every bit of work (i.e. sketches, computer-aided comps, even just simple ideation.)
    so you can show them exactly what you did. Having a well put together and organized
    job profile can go a long way. Sometimes clients don't appreciate all of the little
    things that go into creating a solid design, so keep track of them and bill 'em!
    \  \r\n\r\nAlso consider your prospective client's profit margin. If they are
    economically \"superior\" and/or stand to receive considerable gains from your
    design work then factor that in too...it's sink or swim nowadays!\r\n\r\n\r\n-Get
    that paper Boo Boo"
