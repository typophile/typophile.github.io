  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/prob_3470.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve come across a bug in iOS causing rendering errors with Postscript flavoured fonts. Some characters are rendered lighter than others in landscape mode (subpixels), but when you zoom in or switch to portrait mode (greyscale) they appear correctly again. Tim Brown (edit: Tim Ahrens) over at Typekit looked into the issue with the font in question (I’ve only tested Mobile Safari on iPad, but Tim also sees these problems on the iPod):</p>
<cite>
I think you have discovered a rather weird bug in the iOS type rendering engine. I can reproduce this and have tried to figure out what exactly it is that causes the problem. It must be in the actual outline drawings of the letters in question, not the hinting, features or any other font metadata.
It seems that the rasterizer is not 100% numerically stable and runs into problems when certain constellations of nodes and BCPs occur. It is difficult to pin down exactly what these constellations are, which is not too surprising considering it is a bug.
I had a closer look at the v, which rendered strangely on my iPod. After a bit of playing around, it turned out that tweaking one curve is enough to make it render correctly (see the arrow on the attached image). Looking at this example, and how the other glyphs are drawn, I suspect that it could be related to "retracted" BCPs, although in some cases, they don't seem to cause any problems. I personally also work with retracted BCPs a lot and I am not aware of any rule or convention that forbids this. That said, the only fix I can think of right now would be to "extract" the BCPs.

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a highly unsatisfactory solution having to redefine all the serifs because of this, as this practice is not in any way non-standard. (At least, Font Audit does not think it is.) People need to write better renderers.</p>

Is there a modifier key or other method for grabbing such a fully-retracted handle?

<p>Wait, what? I got the «avoid in-point BCPs» rule from the FF boys (hello Jens!). The Alt-Shift-click technique was something I found more or less by accident while playing around in FL. I think what it does is make the curve [more] symmetrical, which isn&rsquo;t always what&rsquo;s needed. I basically ended up correcting all of my «half-dead curves» manually. :-\</p>

<p>While you are not saying this explicitly, your comments can be read as &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a font quality issue that needs to be address on font level&rdquo; which would be the wrong message. Type designers and font producers cannot, and should not, offer workaround for all other parties' faults.
If certain point constellations cause rasterization issues, it is a rasterizer bug which needs to be fixed. (Hello Apple.)
If they cause issues with cubic to quadratic bezier conversion in one or another font editor, then the conversion mechanism needs to – and can – be fixed. (Hello FontLab.)</p>

<p>Who benefits when one refuses to tweak
curves that expose a flaw in a renderer?
How much time are you saving? And what
are the chances a large corporation will
care enough (beyond its own products,
which it can easily tweak to mask the flaw)
to spend money fixing the problem? Maybe
if you can get somebody of the stature of
Matthew Carter to create a highly desirable
font that exposes the flaw&hellip; What are the

<p>Karsten is right, of course. It is definitely related to our own workflow. We need reproducible results when converting PostScript to TrueType curves, so we need to take that into account as early in the process as possible.</p>
<p>Frode, does this bug occur also in Mac OS rendering? For all I know, it is the same rasterizer as on iOS (except for different settings for subpixel vs. greyscale antialiasing). The FreeType rasterizer is also related, you may want to test with it.</p>

<p>As early in the process as possible, you would want to design your outlines as TT curves instead of PS. This is one reason why I&rsquo;ve been pushing so hard (since 1989), for native TT drawing in font design apps!</p>

Does TT even explicitly prohibit half-dead curves?
What I&rsquo;m wondering is, if we know that a given font will
only ever be in PS, is it <em>safe</em> to leave in half-dead curves?</p>
<p>BTW, Adobe does break some PS rules though - like
Slimbach doesn&rsquo;t bother with explicit extrema for
very small curves, like at the tips of bulgy serifs.</p>
