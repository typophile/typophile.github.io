  and the text? The text is hard to see in this photo so I'm not sure if that's possible
  unless someone is already familiar with it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/joshboston/2282476500/\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: Thank you. I can see the text as Caslon, but the big G too? I can't see it
    but I'm new to all this.
