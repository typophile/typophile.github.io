  odd strokes that stand out.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    needs some work, but I'm still pretty happy with it."

    are two revisions. Flemish Script is what I started with.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/somuch_2_6430.jpg]"

  body: Reads a little better now. That flick off the h seems to feel a little awkward
    in comparison to the rest of the swashes. Is there any way to make it work a little
    more harmoniously? Maybe cutting it a little short and curling the end a little.

  body: "Can't say I do a lot of this stuff these days, but some quick advice/thoughts:\r\n\r\n-
    the flourishes feel forced and a little stiff right now\r\n- don't do this digitally
    from the get go, start on paper\r\n- see if you can grab a copy of Dangerous Curves
    by Doyald Young, great reference.\r\n- if there is a good tattoo parlor in your
    area, talk to the artists there\r\n\r\nA good tattoo artist will take your initial
    sketch and make it work that much better when it's placed onto a curved surface.
    There's a wonderful tradition of hand lettering alphabets being handed down from
    artist to artist in the their craft.\r\n\r\nGood luck"

  body: Thanks Tell. I appreciate your comment and I'll grab that book. I agree on
    the tattoo side as well. I would want them to take my sketch as a reference and
    let their abilities take over. Thanks again.
