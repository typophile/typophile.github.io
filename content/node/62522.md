  body: Thanks so much.  By 'artificial' and 'fake' small caps. Do you mean that they
    just used a smaller font size for what would be lower case?

  body: Exactly. They set it in ALL CAPS and just increased the font size on the "L"
    and "C" to produce a 'faux' small cap... (Not Ideal however, because it changes
    the thickness slightly on certain letters)
