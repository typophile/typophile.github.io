1.I am not sure why the &ldquo;T&rdquo; of &ldquo;The&rdquo; looks to me like a small letter.. may be because of it&rsquo;s height. 
2.Some people may read &ldquo;scribe&rdquo; in a little different way: &ldquo;Scnbe&rdquo;?
3.The &ldquo;e&rdquo; of &ldquo;Scribe&rdquo; ? rotate it and You may get this symbol <a href="http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/06/066.html">http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/06/066.html</a>
4.The ornamental part of the &ldquo;h&rdquo; letter in &ldquo;The&rdquo; looks to me like the pink ribbon.

6.The dot of scribe&rsquo;s &ldquo;i&rdquo; again.</p>

<p>Graham, you’re saying this is ugly? Because I actually
don’t think so. But I would very much like to hear why
you think it is - it might help solve this riddle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reference to ugly was directed elsewhere-another riddle to solve :)
This piece is very much of its day and it would have been well received within the general calligraphic community of the time.
By today&rsquo;s standards it is poor. Its not really fair to pick on the work of a fellow scribe who can&rsquo;t defend him/herself. But it is not what I would have done in 1975, and it certainly is nothing like what I would do today.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you have in mind nor what point you are trying to make with this. There is nothing overtly strange to it that I can see. My take of the &ldquo;The Art of the Scribe&rdquo; is that the pen angle is all wrong from the start and is not correct at any point. It&rsquo;s too small to tell and I would need a much closer look, but if the entire poster is calligraphy as you say, then it does not look to be written entirely by the same hand-can&rsquo;t be sure of this from the jpg.</p>

That&rsquo;s more difficult than doing it vertically which is probably why the top side of that stroke is not as steady looking as the bottom. It is one of the more awkward and inconsistent parts of the design. Most pen strokes are either vertical or horizontal, but the A crossbar, Cap T and rt horizontals deviate from this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit puzzled here expecting that there would be some kind of real mystery revealed. It seems to be just minor oddities in a piece of lettering that was manipulated in whatever means the artist had available at the time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, that &ldquo;serif&rdquo; on the T is simply the result of lifting the nib on one side at the end of a stroke. This makes the stroke get very thin towards the end.
[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/visigoth/|Arthur Baker]] was a master at this, in some of his works you can find hardly any stroke that is written without lifting the nib. Also, some broken scripts show features based on this principle.</div>

<p>I tried reproducing some of Baker&rsquo;s works myself using a broad nib pen and found it much easier when I lifted the nib. I also tried rotating the pen but soon gave up since it wouldn&rsquo;t create that look nearly as easily. So I was convinced Baker must also have primarily lifted the nib but - as your example proves - obviously was wrong. Maybe I used too small a nib.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michael, that Arthur Baker example is amazing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are not enough visual clues in this
piece to indicate it was done by a southpaw!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the top three opinions in this thread that make me doubt that:
-&ldquo;You’d have to rotate your pen anti-clockwise for the ’A’ swirl with quite
a difficult manoevre, and even more so for the clockwise one on the ’h’
(unless your wrist joints are disjointed).&rdquo;
-&ldquo;it might have been originally written at an angle and then skewed upright.&rdquo;
-&ldquo;the pen angle is all wrong from the start and is not correct at any point.&rdquo;
There are a few more, although less focused.</p>
<p>Not to mention that Timo figured it out, and apparently Jonathan (jselig) as well. Unless you think that their being left-handed (Timo too?) makes them jump to conclusions (not impossible I admit). I would be interested to hear specifically what made Timo -and especially Jonathan, since he says he had the idea immediately- think it was made by a left-hander.</p>
<p>Another useful avenue might be to look at the Mike Sull video that David linked to, and (while pondering the relevance of that crabby nib&hellip;) see if a right-hander could produce the same results <em>with equal effort</em> - contortions are grounds for disqualification!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you read it was written by a southpaw and backseat drove from there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;ve been driving this jalopy for years!</p>
<p>Basically I have ideas concerning the fact that ~15% of the population has to go to a &ldquo;worker retraining facility&rdquo; so to speak to do calligraphy &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;. And this ties in to type very poignantly: if there&rsquo;s something Righteously Right about basing fonts on right-handed calligraphy, doesn&rsquo;t that mean there&rsquo;s something Wrong about left-handers? Furthermore, it is a fact that some people have been forced (sometimes by their teachers) to drop calligraphy because they are left-handed. What I have to ask is: what are we missing out on as a result?</p>
<p>This thread was an attempt to extract people&rsquo;s insights in
spite of themselves, and I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was it done by Larry Brady?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re good! The example is from Nemoy&rsquo;s book. He has a whole chapter about how southpaws should do calligraphy - as do many other calligraphy books. I even own a 64-page book titled &ldquo;Left-Handed Calligraphy&rdquo;. And let&rsquo;s not go into how Noordzij suggests they should write&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you get left handed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has to do with the orientation of certain body parts during conception.</p>

<p>I talked with Bob Boyajian today and Larry took his class on left handed calligraphy in the 70&rsquo;s. Bob laughed at your speculation! &ldquo;You cannot tell.&rdquo; Those &ldquo;backward finishes&rdquo; were basically made famous by James Hayes, Arthur Davies, Arthur Baker and Byron MacDonald -  ALL RIGHTIES as far as I know.</p>
<p>Manipulation, whether you want to disqualify it or not, is pretty standard. Not to mention almost natural!</p>
<p>The contortions in Sull&rsquo;s videos are also pretty standard. I turn the paper, turn the pen, add pressure to expand the stroke. You are delving into a field you have no clue about. Stick to your pencils.</p>

<p>True, I cannot; the one calligraphy class I&rsquo;ve taken gave me minimal insight. But that&rsquo;s the main reason I started this thread. The thing is, others here -including Graham- think they can, or at least have some niggling feeling. Maybe they&rsquo;re wrong too. And like I said myself maybe the two who guessed it right were unduly motivated, or just lucky. But for yourself, how can you be sure all those people are way off?</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s something else: if that&rsquo;s in fact true, might it not be because the left-hander is using a &ldquo;special&rdquo; nib, or perhaps a contorted posture? Contortion is good if it&rsquo;s necessary, but can conforming to third-party expectations lead to a full fruition of a person&rsquo;s creativity? I would love to see a left-hander expertly render something &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; - then we might see either something very outlandish, or something very normal. Maybe Bob Boyajian can whip up an example?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand you. Do you mean that you think it was not actually done by a left-hander, because a right-hander like you can duplicate it and/or it&rsquo;s too good? Well, I think it&rsquo;s unlikely that the Nemoy book is incorrect about the scribe and Michael&rsquo;s source is confused as well. On the other hand, if a right-hander AND a left-hander can indeed create this without &ldquo;going out of their way&rdquo;*, then my stance has lost a big chunk of its foundation.</p>

<p>I did not say, nor do I believe I am perfect. Far from it, but I am not going to air out my weaknesses. How dare you question, in such a way, ones commitment and fervor to his chosen field. I constantly question every stroke I make with the pen. I just know forced thought when I see it, especially when it is posited by someone with limited experience in a field that I adore. At 56 I am up at 5 to get down to my studio and get my fingers wet! Most of the time I lay down at 1 in the morning. I am serious about what I do. Reading, practicing, experimenting.</p>
<p>Nobody has brought forth any inkling of proof about the difference of l vs. r. Ultimately the goal is the same, to emulate age old forms! However you achieve it.</p>
<p>Not stonewalling. Just giving you what I know and feel in my bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is: can right-handed and left-handed calligraphers produce the same results with the same effort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absolutely, unequivocally and without reservation!</p>
<p>And as to highway robbery, you are stealing my energy. If you want to do this off line just e-mail me via my contact. You want fervor, you got it.</p>

<p>Here are the top three opinions in this thread that make me doubt that:
-“You’d have to rotate your pen anti-clockwise for the ’A’ swirl with quite
a difficult manoevre, and even more so for the clockwise one on the ’h’
(unless your wrist joints are disjointed).”
-“it might have been originally written at an angle and then skewed upright.”
-“the pen angle is all wrong from the start and is not correct at any point.”
There are a few more, although less focused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You do not have to rotate your pen anti-clockwise for the A swirl. The &lsquo;swirl&rsquo; in question is a simple and basic pen manipulation technique that is an anti clockwise &lsquo;movement&rsquo;, however the rotation is actually to the right - a clockwise rotation. In this case the pen starts at a natural angle of about 60 degrees and in a downward- anti-clockwise movement the right hand edge of the pen is rotated to the right to finish at another natural pen angle of about 20 degrees. This a natural and simple pen manipulation for both right and left handers. It is, in fact easier for the left hander in this particular pen stroke. This standard manipulation is one of the easiest to do and the first one a calligrapher would learn when starting pen manipulation study.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;&hellip;and even more so for the clockwise one on the ’h’ (unless your wrist joints are disjointed).” &quot;
This is not a pen manipulated stroke in any form!  Are we looking at the same piece of lettering? Do you have any idea about pen made letters? From the comments being made in this thread I can only say - and with respect - that there is a lot of ignorance and ill informed opinion on calligraphy standards and practice as well as on how letters are constructed using the tools of the craft.
Nothing special here in pen manipulation and nothing to indicate a left hander. Even given the very steep starting pen angle - this is not always a sign of being left handed although it is more common in left handed beginners trying to write with a right hand nib and coming to grips with the pen hold (pun intended). It is also seen in right handed calligraphy, so its not exclusive to left handedness but is more due to a lack of looking, lack of familiarity with the tool and little understanding of correct letter form.</p>
<p>There is no skewing at all in this work. There is nothing &lsquo;peculiar&rsquo; either. It&rsquo;s a standard example form the time. There is nothing special and nothing to define left handedness. My reference to the pen angle being wrong from the start can not be taken as a sign of left handedness - for this &lsquo;fault&rsquo; is a common one for both left &amp; right handed calligraphers. In this case the pen angles are too steep all round. Again this can not be seen as a sign of left V right.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may find more weight for your research into the direction you wish to take it by studying the effects and influence of religion on left/ right handedness and writing from left to right and from top to bottom and of turning the page from right to left.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Graham, thank you for the detailed -and calm- clarifications.
Sorry that I misunderstood some important parts of what you had written.</p>
<p>Now, when you say:
&ldquo;It is, in fact easier for the left hander in this particular pen stroke.&rdquo;
and
&ldquo;given the very steep starting pen angle - this is not always a sign of being
left handed although it is more common in left handed beginners&rdquo;
does that not seem to correlate with my main point?</p>
<p>I do understand that practice will allow a left-hander to come closer to what a right-hander would more easily render, but I have to suspect that even this difference matters; comfort, &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, is very relevant.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how religion can be a factor, at least in this realm; please elaborate at will. The directionality issue however can be quite a fascinating opening, and I was actually getting ready to ask the following:</p>
<p>Ahmad,
presuming you are experienced in Arabic calligraphy, I&rsquo;m wondering if you think the right-to-left direction of Arabic actually gives an advantage to left-handers (due the smearing issue that Michael mentioned) even though as far as I know the conventional models are still based on right-handed calligraphy. Are there any left-handed Arabic calligraphers whose work might shed some light?</p>
<p>Simon, point taken.

<p>It&rsquo;s indirect, certainly. But I&rsquo;m essentially interested in type, not calligraphy, so you can be sure there&rsquo;s a connection, and it&rsquo;s a connection I already alluded to: if the dominance of right-handedness in calligraphy is spurious (and I admit that does remain a big IF) then the calligraphic basis at the heart of the bulk of type design so far should be tamed, possibly even discarded. To put it another way: 15% of the population cannot be &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo;, cannot be seen as needing to &ldquo;compensate&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s much more logical (and gracious) to think that calligraphy (at least uni-directional calligraphy) is unnatural to type.</p>
<p>Calligraphic &ldquo;handedness&rdquo; is only one piece of the puzzle however. There are other, and much more forceful, arguments that lead to the desire to demote calligraphy in type design. This issue is quite a minor one. But we do deal in details around here!</p>
<p>As very many fellow type people know too well, this is a sentiment I&rsquo;ve harbored for a long time, and I admit it would take a lot to dislodge me from it, considering all I&rsquo;ve seen and all I&rsquo;ve thought. However I am not jaded enough to stop looking for both validation and doubt.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it does support your main point at all. You will need a lot more tangible evidence than what is displayed here.</p>
<p>Religion has a large part to play with manuscript production, therefore it also had a great deal of influence on the development of the alphabet under discussion. Left handedness was considered a sign of the devil and was seen as a curse. It also has direct links in book binding and book design. More research needed before you can conclude anything yet, hhp.</p>

<p>So, at last we come to the crus of the whole exercise. You are on a long path with no end in this battle. 
Unfortunately your very strong and heavy bias against calligraphy is much too strong to engage in a reasonable debate on almost any point on calligraphy or in type design or even within this current thread.</p>
<p>This whole thread was orchestrated to deliver a certain response which has not delivered what you were after, despite a small claim of victory. Any support to your theories stand on very thin ground and to my mind have been refuted.</p>
<p>I would also refute any claim by you that Michael needs to calm down. He has put his point of view across strongly but calmly, as far as I can see. I can find no fault in his argument so far. I haven&rsquo;t felt the &lsquo;blustery manner&rsquo; of any response. What I have felt is your continued trawling to stir the pot and invoke anger with thinly veiled jibes.
Michael has made a sensible suggestion given the direction and length of this thread to continue in private discussion. Michael is an extremely knowledgeable and competent calligrapher, one of the very best in the business, so he has a lot to offer and pass on to any discussion on letter forms, and not just calligraphic letter forms. Why take affront to this suggestion?</p>
<p>Instead of trying to manipulate and twist debate, why not present a documented and detailed submission supporting your theories. This continued clutching at straws will lead to nothing but resentment from those who may be able to offer insight.</p>
<p>This whole debate has become farcical and pointless and destined to a sad end.
Its good day from me.</p>

<p>I have to agree (even if I think there are glimmers of light in this thread). Maybe the Arabic (or Hebrew) angle might be more fruitful, since that seems to favor left-handers (in terms of not smearing at least).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because a text is read from right to left doesn’t

</blockquote>
<p>True. 
On the other hand, it&rsquo;s possible for a right-hander to perform Arabic calligraphy without re-orienting the paper; during a workshop on Arabic calligraphy that I participated in during a type conference in Beirut, we were not told to tilt the paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rotating the page avoids the ink smear problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also &ldquo;avoids&rdquo; the scribe being able to comfortably read what he&rsquo;s writing. :-/
I think the deciding factor might be the length of the text: if it&rsquo;s a short/artistic piece there&rsquo;s more freedom with the paper orientation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You forget that I design type (TDC awards two years running)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations. I can assure you that I fully believe that most of the craft of type design is on your side. Most type is essentially calligraphic. I don&rsquo;t claim to be in the majority. I do however claim to see where type is heading, even if it won&rsquo;t happen in my lifetime. For a glimpse, please see -no, research, and contemplate- the font Legato by Evert Bloemsma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that details can only be achieved by bezier control points?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No actually, one of the <em>main things</em> about type (ideal reading) can only be arrived at through the delineation of the border between black and white, as opposed to the marking of the black. I&rsquo;m not going to elaborate more in this thread, because I&rsquo;ve done so too often in the past here and elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you are not interested in calligraphy, according
to your last post, why did you start this thread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am interested in calligraphy to the extent of learning its limitations and learning how to ween people (including myself) off of it in the realm of type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This continued clutching at straws will lead to nothing but
resentment from those who may be able to offer insight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect to get insight from people who&rsquo;s art I have insulted (if only in the sphere of type - calligraphy of itself I find very beautiful and enriching). I don&rsquo;t think most people are strong enough to remain objective when their entire life&rsquo;s work is doubted; artists especially are more liable to rely on their egos and throw humility out the window, to be honest. And that&rsquo;s why I had to resort to a ruse of sorts - simply to circumvent human nature. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the outcome was predetermined. I really am looking for lights on the path, and this thread has been useful to me: now I know I need better examples, more evidence.</p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the only one who sees inconsistencies in the various opinions and claims made by you and Michael in this thread. These inconsistencies give me hope that there&rsquo;s more to this than meets the hand.</p>
<p>If you were expecting this thread to be a cheerleading festival for your art, I&rsquo;m honestly sorry it turned out into something quite different. I do want people to celebrate, but sometimes there&rsquo;s serious ideological work to be trudged through. In any case, discussions with people I disagree with are my best hope of honing my methods and ideas, so thank you.</p>

<p>The right to left direction? hmm it is a nice theory too, but I don&rsquo;t see a different. It is all about training. Those who learn how to write by left hand are just got trained in a calligraphy school or they have trained them selves to do so.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, let&rsquo;s say that with a little bit of training a left-hander can pen what a right-hander can with the same effort. What about this: let&rsquo;s say we ask a left-hander to write with a normal/natural grasp (like when writing a note with a ball-point pen) and not tilt the paper 90 degrees, and we give him a pen with a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; nib (or actually maybe one that is cut at the opposite angle - do they made those?), what would he create? Surely it would be different than what the right-hander would. Like the axis would be flipped horizontally, no? If so, what would people think of those results?</p>
<p>This experiment would be interesting in both Latin and Arabic (or Hebrew, which however I&rsquo;m far less familiar with so would have trouble evaluating) so Michael, Ahmad, Graham, and possibly others are encouraged to help.</p>
<p>In fact I&rsquo;m sure this has been done before, if only quietly; it seems hard to get left-handers to flaunt that fascinating divergence they&rsquo;re born with. Maybe having struggled to &ldquo;compensate&rdquo;*, at least initially, makes them loathe to go &ldquo;backwards&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s still hanging - attacks do not remove the need to reply in earnest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something else:
It would be interesting to measure the proportion of left-handers in the population of calligraphers. If it&rsquo;s far below ~15% (as I suspect), and if we believe that left-handers have different parameters of creativity (no hard proof that I know of, however) then the question of &ldquo;what are we missing out on?&rdquo; resurfaces.</p>

<p>Absolutely Hrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, what would people think of those results?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorry for the humor&hellip; but it would probably be hard to read.</p>
<p>I thought the percentage was about ten. When I teach Hrant,  I always ask before class starts if there are any hookers in the room. There are usually snickers but invariably a knowing smile on a face appears and a hand is raised. Then everybody gets it.</p>
<p>How they have adjusted has long since passed. Suffice it to say they have adjusted tool (canted edge), stance (of the pen), grip, perspective (orientation of both body and paper) in order to allow them to physically represent the letter du jour. For no known reason I use a similar face to paper as a left hander (only I look from the left), I view from the side as opposed to straight on. Tried to break the habit but I could not give up the pacifier : )</p>
<p>All this to say each of us compensates, and going backwards would be a tough one unless it is caught early on. But, and here is my point, it is in order to accurately make the historical forms that have been passed down through the centuries. Even Zapf, after a few years of practice, reoriented his grip. Not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it seems hard to get left-handers to flaunt that fascinating divergence they’re born with&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not when you give them a tool that is &ldquo;point neutral,&rdquo; such as a pointed pen (Michael Sull) or a ruling pen. Then you really see the smiles.</p>

<p>What about this: let’s say we ask a left-hander to write with a normal/natural grasp..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is normal to a left hander is not normal to right-handers! what I know is, it depends on the person himself. Those Arabic calligraphers who are writing Arabic calligraphy with both hands are a good example. One of them may use some pen that is different than the pen he uses to write by his natural writing hand ( if it is right or left ). This is basically possible as well for right handers, and it means their right hand is comfortable with some pen and their left hand is comfortable with another.</p>
<p>And some of them can write with both hands with same pen too! It is a question of the body itself: how good he can control over his left hand. And btw, I deeply believe it is always possible to get both to work the same way by a lot of training.</p>
<p>And I believe so because I have a personal theory, As a lot of practicing is the key of any hand craftsmanship. It is also the same way it may work for You to use Your right hand or left hand to gain a specific result. I know a girl that can draw with her feet.. and I see she can paint classic paintings too! and she does that because she has naturally born with no arms.. and acutally she doesn&rsquo;t have the arms concept at all. The Natural to her is just feet! It is something about the person at first place, and if someone has not born with his arms, he will instead train him self hard to use his feet, and it seems from her paintings she has a big control over a lot of various lines and colors.. and her art comes very natural.</p>
<p>Another matter of fact, I have read at some place in this thread that one of reasons to run this thread is about some students who has been asked to drop the calligraphy because they are left handers, if I am not wrong about what I read.. I hope what I mentioned is a good reason for them to say: No, we will not forget about calligraphy, we will just try it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see the humor, but I do see a relevant point of discussion. What would make it hard to read? Also, is readability a primary concern of calligraphy these days? When you read a piece of calligraphy, are you typically in a hurry? But of course I&rsquo;m focusing on type, so speed/comfort is a big issue: would a font with horizontally-flipped ductus be slower to read? Why, and for how long?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is quite a peculiar thought to me&hellip;
What about the ones that aren&rsquo;t born yet?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>OK, we&rsquo;re getting somewhere.</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s more like the &ldquo;lettre des milènes&rdquo;!</li>
<li>Are you saying it&rsquo;s a matter of fashion?</li>
</ol>
<p>This leads me to say that it&rsquo;s time to change those clothes, at least when it comes to: making type; left-handed calligraphy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>accurately make the historical forms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me this has little value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>point neutral</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then you can&rsquo;t make the &ldquo;historical forms&rdquo;, correct? BTW, I didn&rsquo;t realize that Hull was using one of those in the video. I have to suspect that more left-handers use those than righties. If so, that&rsquo;s a skew right there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is normal to a left hander is not normal to right-handers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you.
Now, what does this imply?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I deeply believe it is always possible to get both to work the same way by a lot of training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to find any solid research to support that.
I have to doubt it because handedness is linked to brain structure.
On the other hand, it might be possible to change brain structure.
In fact during puberty this happens to all of us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know a girl that can draw with her feet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a story on BBC.com about a boy like that in India.
But we don&rsquo;t know how well such people would have done with arms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>good reason for them to say: No, we will not forget about calligraphy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they&rsquo;re strong enough and if they want to badly enough.
The fact remains that a barrier is there, and I suspect we&rsquo;re losing something.</p>

By turns you read things like &ldquo;With a little effort, you can learn to letter with the broad-edged pen as well as the right-hander&rdquo;, followed not far afterwards by things like &ldquo;the left-handed person is kept at a disadvantage&rdquo; and &ldquo;It is an altogether different way of tackling the problem and must be seen from this other point of view&rdquo;. Every passage contains a &ldquo;sure, no problem&rdquo; followed by a &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really different&rdquo;.

<p>Again, one shouldn&rsquo;t confuse direction of reading with direction of writing, and what needs to be analysed is how letters are constructed, not just the direction in which the arm moves between letters. Yes, left-handed writers might avoid issues of potential ink-smear in writing right-to-left scripts, but they face just as many challenges in terms of letter construction and ductus as they do for most Latin styles. Hebrew letters are basically written following the same construction as Latin letters, starting in the top left of the letter with the characteristic entry stroke. In almost all Hebrew strokes, as with Latin, the pen is pulled. In Arabic, the pen is more likely to be pushed sometimes, hence the importance of the flexible reed and the incredibly smooth paper used by Islamic calligraphers, but the ductus pattern is very similar to that of Hebrew (steeper than Latin, but in the same quadrant).</p>
<p>I suspect the implications of broad nib ductus patterns present the biggest challenges for left-handed writers <em>regardless of script direction.</em> These are always going to mean that a left-hander is at a disadvantage if trying to reproduce writing styles developed by right-handed scribes, and that is as true for Hebrew and Arabic as it is for Latin. Either the arm must be hooked or the page must be rotated; this is unavoidable. Again, this is presuming that the lefty is trying to write a broad nib style developed by and for right-handed scribes.</p>
<p>Things change when the flexible pointed nib and the expansion stroke pattern are introduced, and there are styles of strongly slanted English roundhand at which lefties should excel, because the normal contrast pattern of these letters corresponds to the natural angle of a left-handed writer and special canted pens are made for right-handers to master these styles.</p>

The most commonly used text type for books in Greece, during the 20th century, was Monotype Greek 90, the &ldquo;Plain&rdquo; or &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; style, as it was known. It was originally designed in the early 19th century by Ambroise Firmin Didot.</p>
<p>Why did he produce such a baroque (to use Bringhurst&rsquo;s descriptor of stress) creature and not a &ldquo;Didone&rdquo; face?
And why is the angle of stress &ldquo;left-handed&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I suspect he envisioned a type which would have to satisfy the demands of being part of a triumvirate with Latin Roman and Italic in academic French texts, with a quite different look from either. But what effect did this apparent celebration of minority handedness have on the Greek book-reading populace?</p>

<p>But one shouldn&rsquo;t forget that scribes benefit from reading what they&rsquo;re writing. Writing in a way that makes it more difficult for the writer to read simply to follow a certain unfounded convention is neither intelligent nor honest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how letters are constructed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course my main contention. You refer to a construction that I believe is misguided, especially in terms of what readers need. The construction you refer to is tuned for right-handed scribes, and not the object of design: readers. Furthermore, even in its focus on creation it demotes 15% of the human population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they face just as many challenges in terms of letter
construction and ductus as they do for most Latin styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming they follow the right-handed model, I agree. But not smearing is an advantage, while in left-to-right scripts it&rsquo;s an <em>extra</em> impediment; it might even be a big reason why left-handers are compelled (although maybe mostly by right-handers who are teaching them&hellip;) to write &ldquo;funny&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, I think many of the cultures that switched from right-to-left (or boustrophedon) to left-to-write did so because of the smearing issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In almost all Hebrew strokes, as with Latin, the pen is pulled.
In Arabic, the pen is more likely to be pushed sometimes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Studley book:
&ldquo;the right-handed writer makes the majority of strokes in movements directed primarily away from the body. The left-handed writer makes the majority of strokes in a predominantly pushing movement towards the body. The right-hander pulls the pen across the page from left to right with the writing hand well in advance of the damp ink. To achieve the same results, the left-hander pushes the pen in a way that will not smear the freshly written ink. This is best accomplished by holding the pen below or in extreme cases, above the line of writing.&rdquo;
This seems to reinforce the view that Arabic and Hebrew are more friendly to left-handers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either the arm must be hooked or the page must be rotated</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure. I think with a &ldquo;special&rdquo; nib and enough facilitation of pushing, it might be possible. But I&rsquo;m not in a position to test that theory; I&rsquo;m right-handed.  :-)</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re right, the opposite should be true for right-to-left scripts, no?</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not very interested in left-handers emulating right-handers; to me that&rsquo;s old news, and it&rsquo;s unnatural. I&rsquo;m interested in exploring the missing links. I&rsquo;d like to see a left-handed calligraphic typeface, and gauge how people -readers- react to it.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Nick, maybe Ambroise Firmin Didot was left-handed, and lacking a precedent that he would feel forced to emulate, he did the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; thing? I&rsquo;m just speculating.</p>

<p>That prompted me to look through some reference material.
Wilson (1756) and Baskerville (1763) both have a &ldquo;left-handed&rdquo; stress to their Greeks.
So does Fry (1828) (based on the Wilson).
Fry also has another, &ldquo;right-handed&rdquo; Greek, a clone of the <em>Porson</em> cut by Richard Austin in 1806, based on the handwriting of Greek Scholar Richard Porson.
The Haralambous 18th century German revival <em>Bekkeriana</em> is also a lefty.
It seems probable that the only &ldquo;natural&rdquo; writing-to-type Greek style was the Porson, and that there was a tradition in the West of &ldquo;left-handed&rdquo; Greek types for several centuries.
With earlier Greek types of the 16th and 17th century, the printing is so bad they all look monoline, at least in the few examples I&rsquo;ve seen. Of course, I&rsquo;m no scholar, just a designer with a few type books.</p>

<p>Well, thank you.
Now, what does this imply?</p>

<p>YVW sir, it implies:
1.The one who has born with no arms, started to use her feet instead of it, oh and she can draw better than many art graduated students who have 2 hands in regards of her skills, why? because she doesn&rsquo;t even have the concept of arms ( according to her talk ). Her feet is the natural part of body to write and draw.</p>
<p>2.The one who has a right hand, doesn&rsquo;t have the concept of left hand using.. yes I know he can try it and do it. But he can also try to use his feet to draw and do it too by a lot of training. What I see about the human is he can just try and do.. it is like sports .. You can&rsquo;t enter now a karate battle, but if You got some training for about 1 or 2 years may be You can .. at least You will get a lot better than how You were&hellip;</p>
<p>3&hellip;.and vice versa for a left hander.</p>
<p>And that is how my theory works for me, without finding a research to support it, but I agree a research in that would be very interesting, and may be I can find someone to help me to do it someday. I am a designer too acutally, and I know how research is very important in design field, it is important too in fine art, but a lot of things I know in my illustration/calligraphy part have been known by life experince and by meeting a lot of artists, visiting galleries and reading in art history.</p>
<p>Another matter of fact is most Egyptians have been taught English writing since they were kids in schools. If not, then they started to learn it in primary school. So I guess the English/Latin direction concept as well as the Arabic direction concept. If You ask me what does that implies, I would thank You firstly for asking me, then I personally am not sure, but it should do something with the whole discussion. :)))))</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, my theory is shot. This is a very interesting line of discussion. Let&rsquo;s hope an expert in Greek will chime in. In the meantime, let&rsquo;s ask the calligraphy experts here: are those Greeks in fact left-handed?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems probable that the only “natural”
writing-to-type Greek style was the Porson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Natural to 85% of writers, and specifically with the broad-nib pen.
But in terms of what matters (reading), not necessarily natural at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, what does this imply?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me &ldquo;What is normal to a left hander is not
normal to right-handers&rdquo; supports my overall thrust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>she can draw better than many</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That still doesn&rsquo;t mean she couldn&rsquo;t have done better with hands. Now, sometimes people get motivated by a deficiency. For example, I don&rsquo;t think Lance Armstrong would have been so successful if not for his cancer. But that still doesn&rsquo;t mean she changed her brain structure to become AS GOOD as a right-hander would.</p>
<p>That said, I would love to see some foot calligraphy as well. In fact, as I&rsquo;ve said before many years ago, I think mouth calligraphy would be the most fascinating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he can just try and do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But surely there are limits. For example, we cannot digest tree bark. Also, just because we can do something doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a lot of things I know in my illustration/calligraphy
part have been known by life experince</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is critically important. I&rsquo;m that way too. Often people ask me for Proof, and I tell them just because I don&rsquo;t have any doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m wrong. There are entire dark worlds out there that have not been documented, and to some extent can never be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>most Egyptians have been taught English
writing since they were kids in schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Armenians from Lebanon are taught three writing systems&hellip;  :-)
What does it imply? I&rsquo;m not sure, but if it&rsquo;s anything like learning multiple languages at a young age, it&rsquo;s very good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re. the Didot Greek. Nick, the angle of the ductus in the Didot Greek is consistent with the heritage of the Byzantine minuscule, and with preceding Greek types in the Adline-Garamond lineage. Didot regularised the angle &ndash; one sees more variation in e.g. the Garamond Grec du Roi &ndash;, but this kind of ductus had been characteristic of most Greek writing for more than five hundred years. It isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;left-handed stress&rsquo;: it simply implies that Byzantine scribes, the majority of whom we can assume to have been right-handed, wrote in a manner similar to Sanskrit scribers, with the wrist bent in and/or with the page rotated 30-45 degrees.</p>
<p>Here is an image from my ATypI Prague presentation on the influence of tools and writing styles on the normative shape of letters in different scripts, showing the variety of angles found in a typical Byzantine minuscule (the darker the line, the more prevalent the angle). In the Didot Greek style, the angle is more consistent, but it is close to the dominant angle in the earlier styles of writing and type.</p>

<p>This certainly isn&rsquo;t possible with the kind of nibs one usually finds marketed for lefties. I have a few because they are useful for writing Devanagari. The tip of the broad nib is cut on an angle, so that the writer does not have to hook his arm too far, but hooking or page rotation is still very much necessary. If the goal were for the lefty&rsquo;s writing position to be the lateral mirror image of the typical righty&rsquo;s (forearm extending before the body) then I can imagine a more extreme special nib with a turned head, but since the letter construction would rely on a lot of pushing I&rsquo;m not sure whether such a nib would give enough control. One shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the difficulty of pushing the pen, certainly not if one is going to give lefties the same kind of tools and writing surfaces that right-handed writers use. Islamic calligraphers probably devote more time to sizing their paper than any other scribes in the world; the smoothness of that paper, and the continued use of the reed pen instead of steel nibs, is what makes pushing possible.</p>
<p>Again, all this presumes the lefty is trying to write styles developed by and for right-handed scribes. If I were a lefty interested in beautiful writing, I would be working with split nibs and developing styles following the contrast pattern of the English roundhand, which is ideally suited to left-handed righting.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t implying a link (although trade between the Middle East and India was considerable). We know what the Byzantine writing implement was, because it is described by authors, and we can determine the angle relative to the page from looking at the writing. So from this we can determine that either the wrist was turned inward or that the page was rotated, or both. And the same thing can be concluded about Sanskrit writing from the same information.</p>
<p>Now, this leads one to a conclusion that should be obvious: there is no &lsquo;normal&rsquo; way to write that is independent of the particular script and style of writing. We look at lefties trying to write e.g. Johnstonian foundational hand and we say that the writing position with the hooked arm and in-turned wrist is contorted, and contrasted with the normal, typical or majority way of writing that script it is contorted and it may, in fact, produce artefacts in the writing. But if we saw a Hindi or Bengali scribe, right-handed, writing his native script with an in-turned wrist, we wouldn&rsquo;t say it was contorted because that is the normal way to write those scripts.</p>
<p><em>Is the Sanksrit/Greek way as comfortable?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I think it probably is &ndash; not for me because I&rsquo;m not used to it, and I would need to practice a lot more to get comfortable. Possibly it is actually more comfortable, as a default position, than the typical Latin writing position, because the tendency in the latter is for the wrist to be flexed backwards, whereas the Devanagari position is more relaxed and closer to a neutral alignment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>1) What about a horizontal mirror of the “standard Roman”?</em></p>
<p>What about the reader? Writing and reading are social activities, not idiosyncratic ones, so there is a certain tyranny of the majority in determining the norms of those activities. While I might, if a lefty, find some personal satisfaction in writing such mirrored shapes, I would be very much aware of how they would appear simply freakish to most readers. Perhaps worse, such letters look like a pastiche of Devanagari.</p>
<p>Have you tried writing Latin letters with a mirrored ductus? I have, and one runs into problems with</p>
<p><em>2) What about right-to-left scripts?</em></p>
<p>Arabic or Syriac maybe. Not Hebrew, because in Hebrew the horizontal strokes are mostly written from left-to-right, so the direction of reading isn&rsquo;t any advantage to the lefty writer. But in Arabic and Syriac most of the horizontal strokes are written from right-to-left, so there some advantage in terms of being able to pull the pen. Also, because the typical ductus of these scripts is very steep the arm does not need to be hooked so much as it would to write Latin.</p>
<p>What might be ideal for a lefty would be a script with a normative ductus similar to that of Devanagari but written from right-to-left. I&rsquo;d say that being able to pull the pen is probably the most important element of ease and control in writing.</p>

<p>Agreed. However I would not class script and style equally; the latter is much more intertwined with the &ldquo;normality&rdquo;, while the former is much more (although not entirely) inherited, more of a fixture that one has to adapt to.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see it like that. I think the human body has parameters of comfort, and just because a way of writing a script is accepted doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. So I would like to see the body (particularly that of left-handers) be given more respect, if only in calligraphy; in type it&rsquo;s a different story, but the calligraphic precedent is still useful to discuss.</p>

<p>But inherited from what? We should be careful not to &lsquo;Platonise&rsquo; script. All writing has form and form implies style, with greater or lesser degree of consciousness on the part of the writer. So what we think of as the &lsquo;shapes&rsquo; of a script are in fact the result of historical evolution involving people writing with particular tools on particular surfaces, i.e. of styles of writing. This is the argument of my ATypI Prague presentation: the normative shapes of letters are the products of writing.</p>

<p>Maybe. Let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>Also, it might appear freakish for a while, and then usefully novel (especially in some contexts, like maybe a book about left-handers) after a while, and then ho-hum after a while later. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s smart to assume it&rsquo;s useless; it tends to mean that there&rsquo;s something Wrong with left-handers. Do you believe that?</p>

<p>Nothing Platonic. Inherited from a different medium, like stonecarving, or etching bamboo, etc. When a culture switches a medium, there&rsquo;s still a strong desire/need to emulate the precedent, leading to unnaturalness. This is where I would distinguish script from style: the former is seen as the firm basis while the latter is seen as much more malleable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the normative shapes of letters are the products of writing.</p>

<p>Of course. But the <em>role</em> of letters is not (since the spread of printing) so their shapes need a different control.</p>

<p>Wrist position and stress is something I think about a lot these days, since I started to experience symptoms of carpal tunnel injury. I recently switched to a vertical mouse, which pretty much instantly stopped the symptoms.</p>
<p>I tried writing, with a large broad nib (it had to be large in order to have reasonable control in the unfamiliar position), holding my wrist in a perfectly neutral position aligned with my forearm, meaning that my fingers are extended to the left. This results in a steep natural ductus just past vertical. I wonder if the very fine verticals are a problem for reading? I suspect this is why all normal writing ducti are less steep than this, why the Devanagari scribe hooks his wrist more and why the Latin scribe flexes his back more: both are mechanisms to reduce the contrast.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s easier for left-handers, since I&rsquo;m right-handed and don&rsquo;t know any left-handers who can write Devanagari. I find it fairly comfortable. The thing is that my grip on the pen is more akin to the grip I learned for holding a brush for oriental calligraphy, not the sort of grip that is used for western calligraphy. So my hand isn&rsquo;t hooked quite as much as John&rsquo;s description suggests. (I have to point out that I don&rsquo;t ordinarily grip my pen for even just casual handwriting quite like other people I know.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also never used a steel nib for writing Devanagari. I don&rsquo;t know if people do that. Being a dilettante and a modern westerner, I just use a felt tip pen. If I use a graphic art marker &ndash; you know, with the chisel end tip, instead of a traditional calligraphy shape &ndash; then that&rsquo;s the easiest, and the hand position is closest to my normal. A traditional calligraphy shaped nib, square cut, requires a more hooked position, and I find I use more push strokes. I don&rsquo;t know how any of this would relate to what would be considered traditional.</p>
<p>Writing Latin letters with these same orientations makes for weird-looking letters. Some of the characteristic shapes of the Latin alphabet are just not very accommodating of this approach &ndash; for instance, the arching of h n etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m only part way through a close reading of this thread, although I&rsquo;ve browsed through it several times.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I see in the title line of the calligraphic sample.</p>
<p>The line is entirely consistent with writing using — by Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s definition — downstrokes only. The right-handed writer can do this piece using a vertical orientation of his paper; the left-handed writer can do this piece by rotating his sheet clockwise by 90 degrees. The construction scheme is interrupted construction throughout — again, by Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s definition.</p>
<p>Mostly we are seeing strict translation, with notable exceptions in 1) the swash on the first h that forms the roof of the initial T, and 2) the cross-bar of the A of Art.</p>
<p>The Th swash is made with 3 strokes and 2 pen-lifts. 
[stroke 1] — the loop coming off the stem of the h and going down to about 5 o&rsquo;clock;
[stroke 2] — the left-to-right horizontal ‘downstroke’ above the stem of the T;
[stroke 3] — the vertical downstroke starting from the beginning of [stroke 2].
Note that [stroke 2] uses clock-wise rotation as it proceeds to the join with [stroke 1] (almost as if anticipating the need to avoid making a slight upstroke where this join occurs!)</p>
<p>The A cross-bar swash uses two strokes, the first one mimicing [stroke 2] above and the second substituting an extended curve for [stroke 3] which is then mirrored in the h-swash of the second ‘the’ in the third line.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, I felt the conclusion that there&rsquo;s something funny about the piece relating to left-handedness needed to be put to rest. It seemed to me ideas about how the swashes were constructed needed correction. You tried to use this to launch your critique. Do I have this wrong?</p>
<p>I might have something more to say about what the visual cortex needs, and how that relates to handedly-biased formal grammers and the hybridizing of grammers once I am out of the work crunch I&rsquo;m currently in.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I tried to use that example to launch an exploration*, without being qualified to see anything &ldquo;funny&rdquo; in that example. I do now believe that that example doesn&rsquo;t have enough artefacts of the downtrodden 15%, but the results of this discussion (not least the peppering of inconsistencies) do give me hope that even if one believes that calligraphy** (specifically broad-nib calligraphy, not matter how strange I for one think a particularly shaped piece of metal can have such metaphysical centrality) has a Righteous place in type, there&rsquo;s something unacceptable about limiting it to what right-handers feel more comfortable executing. And I hope that more people will realize this - through discussion triggered by exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually just a side-exploration on this new continent, one unreachable by hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>** I haven&rsquo;t been using &ldquo;chirography&rdquo; in consideration of certain others here. I&rsquo;m not a terminological crusader; even if a word is more accurate, sometimes you must not use it, because there&rsquo;s a higher goal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think, unless I have misread this thread, that Hrant is venturing to criticize the handwriting at the top of this thread because it exhibits traits of left-handedness. Surely this is not a critique at all but rather a &lsquo;proof&rsquo;, as it were, of the fact that left handed writing looks different to right handed writing. It obviously does or no-one would ever have suggested so.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the argument go something like this:</p>
<p>(i) The &lsquo;age-old forms&rsquo; of handwriting are the way they are because they are easier to execute with the right hand, and more people (4:1, 5:1 whatever the correct proportion) are right-handed so more of these forms are said to be &lsquo;correct&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s democracy for you. (Lefty calligraphers were unkindly bullied into contorting themselves or rotating the paper or whatever to achieve these forms faithfully - who said the right-handers were right?)</p>
<p>(ii) The reason current &lsquo;right-handed&rsquo; calligraphic Latin forms are commonplace and customary is that more people are/were right-handed and therefore, through repeated usage, we became thoroughly accustomed to reading letters (the Latin alphabet at least) which are &lsquo;right-handed&rsquo; so to speak.</p>
<p>(iii) Next, the vast majority of printing text faces are, because of ease of recognition through customary usage, heavily wedded to the forms of the hand that belonged to their &lsquo;right-handed&rsquo; predecessors.</p>
<p>(iv) Nobody has ever said that right-looking (as opposed to left-looking lettering) is better looking aesthetically or even functionally, apart from the arguments in (i), (ii) and (iii) to do with what we have become used to. I don&rsquo;t know about you but what we hav e become used to is often utter garbage, we&rsquo;re just too lazy to do anything about it.</p>
<p>(v) Now, suppose more people were left-handed than right, then everything would look completely different (maybe mirrored - who knows?) There would definitely be different ideas about what right and wrong were when it came to the &lsquo;age-old forms&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(vi) The predisposition to closely link the forms of text faced to their right-hand-rendered forerunners may be unhelpful at best, massively detrimental at worst, to the establishment of letterforms that make reading easier which, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, is one of the thing&rsquo;s that makes Hrant tick.</p>
<p>I know this is impossible, but I wonder what text faces would look like if the punch-cutting process had pre-emptend the cutting of the first pen-nib. Maybe the challenge is to imagine what letters would look like had the pen never been invented???</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m totally ignorant but I get fed up with people championing a text face because it is &lsquo;faithful&rsquo; to those age-old forms (after all, even though they might look very beautiful, who said they were right or worth copying?) What I&rsquo;d like to see is something that functions better than lettering that was done with pen and ink.</p>
<p>I guess I like new and some people like old. Otherwise why would some people &lsquo;waste&rsquo; so much time doing revivals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant: <em>Now, if we discover that there’s nothing Wrong with such a rendering, the
right-hand broad-nib basis of type surely becomes quite suspect.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it becomes &lsquo;suspect&rsquo;, I think it becomes recognised as what it always was: a cultural phenomenon, a set of conventions arising from particular tools and practices during the maturation of our writing system. When we design type, we interpret that writing system and, to borrow a concept from Gadamerian hermeneutics, all interpretations happen relative to a tradition (even if it is in opposition to that tradition).</p>
<p>Where the tradition has considerable internal force &ndash; as distinct from cultural conservatism, financial caution, etc. &ndash; is in the influence of the particular tools and practices on the basic shape of letters, such that these shapes are either difficult to make or present design problems when written with other tools and/or different practices (e.g. a different ductus).</p>
<p>In principle, I&rsquo;m not wedded to the idea that typography should endlessly follow the patterns established by particular models of right-handed chirography (and note that there are multiple patterns, which is evidence that the tools and practices are not deterministic but enable invention). My main concern is that a typeface needs to be internally consistent, not that it needs to follow a particular model.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr.Papazian said:</p>
<p>.BTW, I managed to dig up that “Left-Handed Calligraphy” book (Vance Studley*, a 1991 Dover facsimile of the 1979 edition) and the inconsistencies I see here are reflected there as well. By turns you read things like “With a little effort, you can learn to letter with the broad-edged pen as well as the right-hander&quot;.</p>
<p>Do You mean they have to read from right to left like Arabic language speakers?
A question came to my mind: Do the Arabic and English calligraphers or even normal people write the single letter from right to left or from left to write?</p>
<p>Same Question should be asked for a Chinese calligrapher too?
and BTW, How the left handers Chinese calligraphers are dealing with this problem.</p>
<p>If I am not wrong, we all starts from right to left.. even the left hander starts right to left too? then reading from different directions would not make any different.</p>
<p>But it may make a different then with the whole text .. as any way left hander should fill the page from left to write in Latin languages. I will here copy and paste a part from Wikipedia that strongly supports Mr.Papazian point of view about directions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be difficult for left-handed children to learn to write if the teacher does not take the student&rsquo;s left-handedness into account. In fact, even in the later 20th century, some UK schools were discouraging children from writing with their left hand, often seriously affecting the child&rsquo;s development (Hansard 1998). When properly done, left-handed writing is a mirror image to that of the right-hander, making the teaching process confusing for the right-handed teacher of a left-handed student. The result is that many left-handed children learn to write with their hand curled around the pen so that it can meet the paper at the same angle as the right-hander, rather than simply tilt the paper the opposite way.[citation needed] Once this habit is formed, it is difficult to break.[citation needed] This curling of the hand results in the heel of the palm being placed behind the writing, forcing the writer to lift it off the paper and making the grip even more awkward. In addition, constantly lifting and replacing the hand over fresh ink often causes smudging, causing problems for many left-handed students, especially in exam situations. Ink is also rubbed on to the hand, causing an inky hand. When the left hand is held correctly, it is below the writing, as is typical for right-handers.</p>
<p>However, left-handed people who speak Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Hebrew or any other right to left language, do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right to left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left to right languages. Still, due to these alphabets being developed for right-handed people, the characters are still often more easily matched to a right-handed profile.&rdquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handed">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-handed</a></p>
<p>The other only point which I disagree with You about is the point of the girl..</p>
<p>Every now and then, You keep saying when a left hander needs to make the same quality with his right hand, he has to change his brain structure.. because it is linked to brain? I see yes they can without going to anything related to change brain structure.. Why do I need to change my brain structure to train my hand to bring specific quality of art work.. it is just a matter of training.</p>
<p>Do You know people with long-term impairment of the right hand are more likely to become left-handed, even after their right hand heals. Such long-term impairment is defined as eight months or more. Even without touching their brain by their thumb.</p>
<p>I am not sure why I need to know what the girl who has no arms could do if she got them! I have told this example to prove that human can do anything could be trained to do. It is not about the examples You have mentioned.. have time and watch the national geography about the shawling temple, if You didn&rsquo;t yet. I am sure You will be surprised how some normal people by training can break rocks and their bodies get some resistance to sharp tools to not even injure them.. aside from walking by some strange ways that normal one can&rsquo;t do. It has nothing to do with a disabilities.. because they are normal people, it just proves man limitations are possible to control.</p>
<p>Nothing is impossible, the fact is since 3000 years egyptians used to write by their hands and walk by their feet, oh and it happened to be the same even back in history that when there were no writings at all, and man used to draw his drawings on rocks by his hands and walk by his feet.. when a woman can challenge that and use her feet to write, draw and produce art forms without changing her brain structure, then a left hander can do the same like a right hander even better in many cases in Arabic calligraphy at least, which is pretty hard and complicated. Yes, I agree we are never sure if the name I told were to produce better quality if they were right handers, but at least I know they produced better quality than those who has a right hand, it is possible the left handers has a different way in thinking according to what I have read, but it is possible too it is based on the person him self! Actually both cases are possible for logic and the more logical to me is the fact it depends on the person. But the question which I think You even ask: Do we need really the left hander to use his left hand and right hand the same way? or do we need to improve the skills that his left hand gave him.. which are described in this thread or even to be described.</p>
<p>And btw, I am not trying to jump to conclusions, I am just showing the ideas I have to discuss with You.</p>
<p>Actually to be honest with You typophilers, if this thread should take us any where, it should in my opinion be about advancing our educational system to deal with left handers , exactly like how Michel does .. it is very true one should ask the class firstly if there is any left hander .. I see the thread is going some where to the fact what as easier for a left hander may be harder for right hander, and vice versa.. and that may lead the left handers to create some different fonts, etc. I am happy we reached this phase of discussion, and I am sorry if I didn&rsquo;t follow part of it, because I was away for long time and just came back lately and I keep reading some old posts.. but any way I want to say before we think about that, we should think how left handers are getting help at first place. Do the education systems have a full understanding for what left-handed can do to improve it, and what they can&rsquo;t? Does the educational systems give them the chance to create new fonts or even a new visuals of the current fonts, and to be explained by them. Because left handers are smart too, according to some research the proportion of left-handers is rising and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. Left-handers brains are structured differently in a way that widens their range of abilities, and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.</p>
<p>However, the problem of left handers is not just about calligraphy according to wikipedia to I see the industry doesn&rsquo;t consider them enough, most mouses are done for right handers, same for scissors, and knifes. &ldquo;The lack of left-handed tools and machines in many workplaces is not only a nuisance to many left-handers, but has actually placed them at peril. In fact, some factories have installed left-handed equipment after successful class-action lawsuits on behalf of left-handed employees.&rdquo; Which makes me ask how comfortable are them with the industries pens, in case I told already those left handed Arabic calligraphers are normally crafting their pens at the angle that works better for them.</p>
<p>Mort to be told later about this part when I hope.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, I am part of the downtrodden 15 percent, yet I don&rsquo;t feel like dirt.</p>
<p>As an exploration try the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>divide your students into lefties and righties</li>
<li>give both an identical catalogue of basic shapes — this could be circle / rectangle / triangle <em>or</em> bird / giraffe / tree.</li>
<li>subdivide both the lefties and the righties into five groups — group one gets a ball point pen or pencil; group two gets a set of chisels and a hammer; group three gets a broad-nibbed pen; group four gets a flexible straight-pen; group five gets a set of chinese calligraphy brushes.</li>
<li>sequester the various groups and set each group the task of writing the basic catalogue of shapes on a daily basis for the entire semester with attention to maximizing speed, maximizing articulation, enhancing cohesivenes as a group, and consolidating the wholistic integrity of the unit made by placing them in combinations.</li>
<li>take what emerges from this process and translate the products a) into metal punches and b)directly into a digital font.</li>
<li>the next semester, using a different set of groups have them review what the others are doing on a weekly basis.</li>
<li>the next semester go directly to punch-cutting or digital form-giving from the catalogue of basic shapes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further points:</p>
<ol>
<li>the centrality of the broad-nibbed pen in Western writing is circumstantial, as John suggests, not metaphysical.</li>
<li>there is nothing righteous about calliigaphy, but the durability of the products of a hand in combination with a proper tool comes from it&rsquo;s ability to give shapes a stable construction and a consistent volume, and — related to this — it&rsquo;s ability to facilitate effective co-ordination of the whites between and inside letters. This latter is tantamount to optimizing notan.</li>
<li>the reader (what the body as visual cortex needs in reading) has always been an integral (or dialogic) part of the equation — what survives in writing or the evolution of a script are the things that 1) optimize perceptual distances between individual letter forms and 2) optimize the visual integrity and optical-grammatical distinctiveness as a unit of the word-wholes they form.</li>
<li>the essence of punch cutting is feature manipulation inside a parametrically hyper-malleable domain; each novel feature manipulation is also a norm-violation in relation to what has previously occurred within the domain; feature manipulation is susceptable to cultural pressures, personal preferences, and external shape-modelling paradigms; it should be hyper-explored; what survives will be things that 1) optimize perceptual distances between individual letter forms and 2) optimize the visual integrity as a unit of the word-wholes they form..</li>
<li>on your criteria the products of left-handed dominance might be as problematic as the existing alternative, especially as it also &lsquo;privileges the black.&rsquo;</li>
<li>hybridization puts at risks the cohesivenes as a group, and consolidating the wholistic integrity of the unit made by placing the members of the group in combinations.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, I&rsquo;m largely in agreement with you. The one thing that I like to clarify in such discussions is that I think novelty for its own sake is no better than blind conservatism.</p>
<p>John, I can imagine, but: it&rsquo;s not the same; this way, others benefit. So thank you, twice.</p>
<p>Your result is very interesting. Besides being even less freakish to me than the left-hand one (for both we would reduce the contrast) there&rsquo;s that fascinating split, like in the top-left of the bowl of the &ldquo;d&rdquo;, a result of avoiding pushing the pen. I can see that becoming a full-fledged -if preferably subtly applied- feature of a typeface, sort of like the abrupt shift on the insides of calligraphic strokes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it becomes recognised as what it always was: a cultural
phenomenon, a set of conventions arising from particular tools
and practices during the maturation of our writing system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad to hear you (and Peter) say that, but you should know that there are many people (such as Gary Munch) who have expressed a very deep and necessary human link between writing (and often specifically right-hand broad-nib writing) and reading.* Tellingly, these tend to be the people -unlike you and Peter- who make a lot of calligraphic type&hellip; This is very disturbing to me, and all of us are responsible for purging this delusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I have to suspect that certain people in this discussion feel the same way, even though at this point they may opt to keep that in the closet&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>The questions between people like me and people like you &amp; Peter are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the advantages of totally breaking the link to writing?</li>
<li>How quickly do people adapt to new structures?</li>
</ol>
<p>To me both questions have firm -if not assured- answers: the advantages are greater readability and the opening of a new dimension of style; and the speed of adaptation is very fast, on the order of hours at most (with for example Gary himself once pointing out that a &ldquo;g&rdquo; he had trouble with* stopped bothering him after a few pages).</p>
<ul>
<li>Nevermind that most laymen certainly don&rsquo;t even get that far, at least not consciously.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a typeface needs to be internally consistent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This I&rsquo;ve always had trouble with. A typeface needs to work, not be some sort of creative exercise. Also, what&rsquo;s &ldquo;internally consistent&rdquo; about the thin diagonal of the &ldquo;Z&rdquo; in your fonts?</p>
<p>Ahmad, I&rsquo;m not grasping the connection between reading direction and writing direction. If you&rsquo;re referring to my comment that doing calligraphy vertically (in order to maintain the historical model) prevents the writer from comfortably reading his writing, that&rsquo;s true because we read laterally irrespective of script. We can talk about Chinese, although these days they do their stuff mostly laterally too I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the Arabic and English calligraphers or even normal people
write the single letter from right to left or from left to write?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Latin, people tend to write the letters left-to-right (some people going back to dot &ldquo;i&quot;s, cross &ldquo;t&quot;s, etc.) while in Arabic at least* people tend to make the entire body of the letter cluster segment leftward without lifting the pen. No?</p>
<ul>
<li>John says it&rsquo;s different in Hebrew, which makes sense because unlike Arabic the letters are detached.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning brain structure:
It matters because the brain does have a structure, and it affects the way we perform things, including which hand we&rsquo;re more comfortable writing with. It&rsquo;s well-known for example that the left and right halves of the brain are better at different things, and some of this propagates throughout the body. Furthermore, after puberty changing brain structure is not known, or at least not fully revealed. This is why for example when a person learns a foreign language as an adult he will almost certainly never lose his accent. The point is, as an adult, no matter how hard one tries, the handedness will remain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>human can do anything could be trained to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this. For example, we cannot fly. More modestly, something from a closer sphere: we cannot move our eyes in a smooth motion unless we&rsquo;re looking at something that&rsquo;s moving; we can only saccade. The brain is structured in this way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do we need really the left hander to use his left hand and right hand
the same way? or do we need to improve the skills that his left hand
gave him.. which are described in this thread or even to be described.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking about society and not the individual, I would say that
we need to learn from the left-hander to benefit more people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>according to some research the proportion of left-handers is rising</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very interesting! Do you have a reference?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t feel like dirt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Downtrodden&rdquo; was a bit much, sorry. It&rsquo;s not like I even think calligraphy has any place at all in the topic at hand: type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an exploration try the following.
&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elaborate experiments are wonderful.
Common sense is even better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This latter is tantamount to optimizing notan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than ignoring notan, but it&rsquo;s still non-ideal. Since we know of a higher ideal (treating the border between the white and black as the focus of design), continuing to leverage calligraphy is a waste of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the products of left-handed dominance might
be as problematic as the existing alternative</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course. I&rsquo;m simply using the utter dominance of the right hand as further proof that calligraphy cannot be a serious foundation for type (because 15% of the population cannot be Wrong). That said, if one insists on using calligraphy as a foundation, one must make left-handed calligraphic type (not to mention Indian-style calligraphic type, since by some accounts it&rsquo;s more comfortable) on occasion; one must stop promulgating the right-hand model with such oppressive conviction.</p>

<p>Other than making a post-colonial socio-political gesture, in what way is that any less objectionable than &lsquo;Latinising&rsquo; Devangari or any other script with its own history and distinctive cultural identity? To me, the typical ductus is such an inherent quality in the identity of a script that I see it as an impervious barrier, in terms of harmonising type designs for different writing systems. [I came to this conclusion after designing the Constantia Greek in 2003, which was the last time I tried to adapt Greek letters to a (hybridised) Latin ductus.] Note that this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I consider the typical ductus an impervious barrier in the design of new types within a single script &ndash; on the contrary, this is one of the ways in which new styles are developed, as any history of writing will illustrate (and historically writing has been much more dynamic in this regard than typography) &ndash;, but I don&rsquo;t think it is mechanism that should be employed to forcibly integrate two different scripts, subjecting one to the other. Taking your Noor+Patria types as an example, my inclination &ndash; as a typographer, setting bilingual text &ndash; would be to use the two &lsquo;dominant&rsquo; fonts together and ignore the subjugated ones altogether. For me, multilingual typography should be about allowing the individual voices to speak: to borrow musical terminology, it is about polyphony not homophony.</p>
<p>In cases where styles with variant ductus or other characteristics that might suggest themselves as harmonious with other scripts have developed organically within the individual traditions, then interesting possibilities arise [cf. Nyala.] But even then, it can be a mistake to leap to a combination based on similarity of forms without considering the <em>associations</em> those forms have within their individual traditions, consciously or unconsciously held by the reader.</p>

<p>As well, I might be accused of trying to leverage Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s analytic inventions for getting a handle on design, but I should not be accussed of trying to promote calligraphic styling in type design. My contention that all novel feature manipulation is a norm-violation should not be construed as implying it is bad.

</blockquote>
<p>I certainly know what you mean. It is highly objectionable if it mirrors the long-standing deplorable practice of making Latinized fonts for other scripts <em>as a routine</em>. The important distinction is that it&rsquo;s OK if the purpose is such; Latinized fonts work very well when the non-Latin setting is embedded in a block of Latin. The problem is such fonts are used to set whole books in that language, not least because counterparts going the other way are not provided. It&rsquo;s unilateral, instead of multilateral. So my contention isn&rsquo;t that Latinization is Evil, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s simply out of control, and not understood.</p>
<p>You might use only the two masters in the Nour&amp;Patria system*, but a font is a tool and not an ideology, and others might want to use the subordinates for setting snippets or even short passages within the dominant script**. In fact in Nour&amp;Patria you can&rsquo;t do that with the two master designs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I myself would might use the Latin subordinate to the Armenian to set texts -even long texts- about an Armenian topic. Like maybe the captions for:
<a href="http://www.eastofbyzantium.com/">http://www.eastofbyzantium.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>** This is what Emily Artinian did in her large-format artist&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;From Ararat to Angeltown&rdquo;:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your dismissive stance to my proposed exploration makes me doubt your sincerity in launching this thread. My starting point was John&rsquo;s little samples, which you found useful.</p>
<p>As I understand it, chirography is paraphrastic of the pen. This is different than saying some type is para-paraphrastic. Etymologically <em>para-</em> is <em>beside</em>, <em>alongside of</em>, <em>by</em>, <em>beyond</em>. For me para-paraphrastic is not a program or stance, but a type-historical fact.</p>
<p>Legato is para-paraphrastic. It takes the product of contrast reduction on a template of expansion and twists the counters counter-clockwise to get a contrast or stress that ressembles that of the neo-humanistic sans serif Today. Today, ironically, is contrast reduction on a template of translation. The twisting in Legato is a norm-violating feature-manipulative action, which I am for. The interesting perceptual-psychological question is why should this enhance rapid automatic visual wordform resolution as Bloemsma thoguht it might. I think it is because co-ordinated tensivities inside bounded maps of visual information promote unitization of the form.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant:<em>Your result is very interesting. Besides being even less freakish to me than the left-hand one&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Neither of the quick example images I posted were &lsquo;left-hand&rsquo;: the first showed the result of the right hand in a neutral position aligned with the forearm, the second showed the result of the right hand hooked inward. I&rsquo;m not surprised that you found the latter less freakish than the first, because it exhibits a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; (typical, average) contrast between thick and thin strokes. As I wrote above, flexing the wrist (out for Latin, in for Devanagari) is a means to reduce contrast. [Kent&rsquo;s comment about how he actuall holds his pen when writing Devanagari should not be ignored, by the way. What I&rsquo;m doing is playing with variations on the European positioning, in which the hand is close to the paper; there are plenty of places in the world where people write with their hand further from the writing surface and, hence, more above the text and below or to the side.]</p>
<p><em>I’m very glad to hear you (and Peter) say that, but you should know that there are many people (such as Gary Munch) who have expressed a very deep and necessary human link between writing (and often specifically right-hand broad-nib writing) and reading.* Tellingly, these tend to be the people -unlike you and Peter- who make a lot of calligraphic type&hellip; This is very disturbing to me, and all of us are responsible for purging this delusion.</em></p>
<p>There are deep links between writing and reading, which I don&rsquo;t think should be thrown out with the delusional bathwater, but I agree that they are not per se necessary (they are circumstantial). The links have a common sense basis: no one invents a writing system that people can&rsquo;t read (ignoring some calligraphic modes which are really games not text). So of course writing is linked to reading; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that reading is linked to writing (in the limited sense of chirography, not the wider sense of writing that includes &lsquo;typewriting&rsquo; and other means of text manufacture).</p>
<p><em>The questions between people like me and people like you &amp; Peter are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the advantages of totally breaking the link to writing?</li>
<li>How quickly do people adapt to new structures?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Your number 1 is <em>seriously</em> begging the question.</p>
<p>I would phrase the questions slightly differently:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there advantages to breaking the link between reading and writing <em>more than it has already been broken</em>?</li>
<li>If so, what are these advantages?</li>
<li>Are there potential disadvantages?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your number 2 is really much of a question, at least between us. As you know, I think readerability is overwhelmingly the dominant factor in reading, so of course I think that &ndash; physiologically and cognitively &ndash; humans can quickly and easily adapt to new structures and the patterns they produce. But the pressures on the form of text are not physiological and cognitive, they are cultural and economic, and these forces encourage conservatism.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I’ve always had trouble with [the idea that a typeface needs to be internally consistent]. A typeface needs to work, not be some sort of creative exercise. Also, what’s “internally consistent” about the thin diagonal of the “Z” in your fonts?</em></p>
<p>I presume you mean the typical <em>thick</em> diagonal stroke of most serif types, which appears to contradict the typical ductus derived from the moving front. It is precisely for the sake of consistency that this feature was developed: in typical Latin letters all strokes connecting the x-height and baseline regions are heavy strokes not hairlines. The unique shape of the letter z breaks this pattern when written with the same ductus as the other letters, so the letter is written with a rotated pen in formal book hands to maintain consistency with the other letters.</p>
<p>I should clarify what I mean by &lsquo;internally consistent&rsquo;, and perhaps try to find a more precise term. I certainly don&rsquo;t mean that every part of every letter in a typeface must be consistent with a particular stroke model analysis, let alone with the results of a particular chirographic exemplar. What I mean is that a typeface should be <em>analysable in its component parts so that the whole can be understood.</em> A typeface is not a gathering of arbitrary shapes &ndash; Rotis excepted! &ndash;, it is a system of shapes. If we look at a page of text and some shape seems wrong, seems not to fit in the system, we should &ndash; as professionals, not necessarily as laymen &ndash; be able to explain <em>why</em> that shape seems wrong. And that means we need to be able to understand what is happening within the system.</p>
<p>When I see examples of neophyte type design in the Typophile critique threads or elsewhere, what I see most often is arbitrariness (and this is true also of my own first attempts sixteen years ago). What is lacking are the analytical tools to understand the relationships that make up a system. The system itself does not need to have particular characteristics &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t need to be chirographic or based on a broad-nib translation stroke model, any more than it needs to be a revival of Jenson or a Modernist sans &ndash; but it does need to have that internal consistency that identifies the system as a system and makes it work as such.</p>
<p>Now, a few other observations arise from this. One is that the system may be multifaceted and, hence, analysable in multiple ways. Another is that the same typeface may be analysed in different ways by different observers, and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>I think that Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s theory of the stroke provides <em>one</em> very strong analytical tool: one which I use every day when making decisions about shapes. Perhaps more importantly, I was instinctively looking at shapes in this way for many years before I read Noordzij&rsquo;s formulation of the theory. What Noordzij did was to expand my analysis, so that I saw and understood things that I had previously missed. Crucially, I think Noordzij has described the hermeneutic tradition within which type design exists, and has done so in a way that is independent of the lore, legend, personalities and advertising copy that make up much &lsquo;typographic history&rsquo;. As I wrote earlier in this thread, a hermeneutic tradition is not something from which one can escape, and in some ways one is most deeply embedded in that tradition when one is critiquing it and finding reasons for rejecting it or extending it.</p>

<p>The observation that punch cutting when applied to writing leads to a heightened level of feature-analytic engagement on the level of form, and new prospects for enhancement, is entirely my own, as is the corollary that this can lead to norm-violating feature-manipulative action, which, when strategically applied in text face situations, or creatively applied in display situations, is or can be positive or progressive. I think it can be progressive for many of the reasons that you think being antichirographic is. I just don&rsquo;t need to debunk writing to make my claim.

<p>Just make the damn typeface already. Believe it or not, I agree that what you want to do is possible and may have benefits. You are obviously having a hard time conveying this concept, and why not? Words rarely suffice to describe a visual effect. Go ahead and make a typeface without a single pen artifact. I absolutely believe you can do it and it will be illuminating to many. One hopes you won&rsquo;t simply be reacting to what you see as an oppressive dominant paradigm like some resentful catholic. Maybe the reason you aren&rsquo;t getting a lot of traction is that these theories don&rsquo;t really hold much weight in their conceptual form. Make it happen! Show rather than tell.</p>

<p>I agree. Hrant, go ahead! Manipulating people to your own end is one thing, but backing up babble (or BS) is another. You tell a client you know the solution, you gotta produce!</p>

<p>Hrant, Good luck with that. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re crazy. I do think you have your work cut out, but then so does Michael, it&rsquo;s just different work. Wouldn&rsquo;t be much fun if we were all the same. The world needs pioneers as much as craftsmen.</p>
<p>Michael, we all have inabilities. I don&rsquo;t think the swipes were at you or even calligraphy per se but rather at calligraphy being the perennial driving force behind modern type design. If the left-handed stuff looked (even marginally) different at the start, but just as &lsquo;good&rsquo;, why is it so wrong to question right-handed forms as the only valid influencer on functional, readable type? This has nothing to do with a dislike of calligraphy&hellip; maybe ennui but not hatred.</p>
<p>Carl, is it not shrewd of Hrant to take counsel before embarking in a particular direction? He could have saved himself several thousand hours of fruitless labour if someone wise had made so much as a throw-away comment; I&rsquo;m not sure if many have.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The minute one stroke is thicker than another, it will attract accusations of being &lsquo;pen-led&rsquo;. There will also be letters involved. Surely every letter (I am talking basic shape, not individual stylistics) in its crudest and most embryonic form was written first before it was ever drawn/punched/described by mouse/whatever. Is what you are suggesting really possible? If you really think so, I&rsquo;m surprised that you don&rsquo;t want to have a go too? Or has Beorcana (which, by the way, you already know I think is one of the most attractive faces ever) completely knackered you out? Hope not.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already working on something vexing and experimental. One of those at a time is plenty. Thanks for the appreciation, Nick.</p>
<p>I think we ought to stop talking about this because there are too many pitfalls to over-conceptualizing; for every Legato there&rsquo;s a Rotis. I also think we&rsquo;re closer to this abstract goal than we realize. And the results may not look all that radical.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>Seb Lester, an avid calligrapher, believes that being left-handed is a disadvantage in calligraphy.</cite></p>
<p>And of course it is, <em>for the calligraphy of scripts written from left to right</em>.</p>
<p>A naïve person might then ask why there are scripts written from right to left, for which being right-handed is a disadvantage. However, the historical reason is simple enough; these scripts arose before the invention of paper, and were written on things like clay tablets, where ink smear was not a problem. Without that problem, it was natural for a right-handed person to start with the right arm at rest, and then move it to more extended positions along the writing surface.</p>
<p>As to your example, it was much too difficult for my simple skills.</p>
<p>My first guess would be that since the thin parts disappeared in the alphabets around the edge, this was reminiscent of a certain style of Armenian typeface.</p>
<p>My second guess would be that the very long flourishes on two of the letters were added after the fact, cheating or no.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought &ldquo;left-handed&rdquo;, since the letters don&rsquo;t have reversed ductus. But on reading the thread, I do note that they have <em>exaggerated</em> ductus, given the nib being inclined 45 degrees, and a left-handed person preparing the calligraphy using the same writing-sideways technique traditionally used by right-handed people to write Hebrew is as good an explanation of that as any.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not proof&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a reason to reject raising the possibility.</p>
<p>But since it&rsquo;s a poster about calligraphy, exaggerating the ductus to get its calligraphic nature noted is an obvious reason for it by itself.</p>

<p>Well, since it&rsquo;s easy enough to turn the paper sideways, and some left-handed people have produced excellent Latin-alphabet calligraphy, what seems like denial may merely reflect the passion of our current era for equality.</p>
<p>Which is well-intentioned, and even its excesses cause only minor harm compared to what it is a reaction to. But that is still, to me, not an excuse for doing needless harm.</p>
