body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nIve decided to delete the previous thread because it was just
  too cluttered and the images were H U G E !\r\n\r\nSo starting afresh:\r\n\r\nive
  spoken to the client who insists on having an \u2018edgy\u2019 invite. Title was
  also chosen by her so i cant do much about it.\r\n\r\nShe also specified she wanted
  a black invite so i thought this was a great opportunity to play around with spot
  UV varnish.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using Didot Elder for the title as it has devilish
  arrows on some of the letters which could look quite cool ( yet to purchase it),
  also a nice italic would be an option ( didnt nail it with my choice so far). Any
  suggestions would be much appreciated. something elegant and almost hand written
  might look cool.\r\n\r\nI was also thnking of incorporating a graphic on the front
  ( that will be spot uved) which references the venue in which the show will take
  place.\r\n\r\nWhat do u all think of the composition or the 2 options? The text
  in dark grey is meant to represent the type when spot UVed.\r\n\r\nwith regards
  to spot uv are there any rules i should be aware of in terms of the weight of the
  typeface ( eg. will didot work? thin strokes)"

  body: "Are you doing a 'dull' or 'gloss' varnish and how noticeable do you want
    it to appear in the end? Also, what kind of stock?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is
    because some of the soy based inks have a semi-gloss appearance in heavier coverage.
    I did a 'gloss' varnish on a very dark brown on an uncoated card stock and afterward
    you could barely see it until you turned the card and it caught the light. I didn't
    discover this until the press check which made adding a 'dull' varnish to the
    other area very costly.\r\n\r\nYou'll want to talk with your printer regarding
    your desire to use Didot at a smaller size. It may produce a less then desirable
    result. If you're unfamiliar with using varnish I'd ask if they have any samples
    so you can get a framework for appearance."

  body: "thanx for the reply CreativeNRG.\r\n\r\nI am planning to do a gloss varnish
    on coated paper as i have been reading that with uncoated the ink seeps thru and
    turns an odd color.\r\nIve also changed the body text to a san serif and changed
    the layout as you can see in the newly uploaded foto, also read san serifs work
    better than serifs at small sizes when applying spot uv varnish.\r\n\r\nHowever
    i am thinking about using didot elder http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/view_font.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=9&id_font_type=25for
    the front, given the name and the devlish details of the face i reckon it could
    work, though i am a bit concerend of the hairline details if i spot uv it.\r\n\r\nif
    you have any type recommendations of elegant but naughty typefaces do let me know.
    I would like to try other type but havent quite found what i am looking for. A
    typeface that is  a rich, strong,respected elegant woman whos got herself a toy
    boy is what im after.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion-mischief-FRNT-THEONE_5545.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion-mischief-back2-THEONE-typo_6117.jpg]"

    and <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000118\">Eloquent</a>
    from Jukebox. They come with a little female attitude.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe
    the term is 'boy toy'. :)\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL NOTE: If you use a 'gloss' varnish
    over the black on a coated stock for the text you're going to have a hell of a
    time reading it unless you also apply a 'dull' varnish to the rest of the area.
    Also, regardless of a varnish being apply or not, those thin serifs may give you
    big trouble with that heavy of a ink coverage. I'd almost guarantee they will
    start to fill in... even on coated stock.\r\n\r\nOne option you may want to ask
    the printer about would be to print white ink on a black stock."

    to this project\r\n\r\ncabarnet however could be an option.\r\n\r\ni was also
    thinking of opting for white ink on black stock for the cover but first i have
    to choose an appropriate typeface. didot elder is cool. i like its quirkiness
    but the extreme hairlines render it too fashiony i feel. i need something thats
    a bit more interesting and less cliche that would work well if i wanted to spot
    uv it or white ink.\r\n\r\n\"If you use a \u2019gloss\u2019 varnish over the black

  body: "<cite>rest of the area meaning the white text?</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, I was referring
    to the other black area.\r\n\r\nBasically, you would use a 'spot UV varnish' on
    the text as indicated and a 'spot dull varnish' on the rest of the black to insure
    you could see the effect. I uploaded some images I took of the press sheet and
    I can't express enough how subtle the gloss varnish turned out over dark brown
    without the dull varnish. The printer told me they even used some new 'ultra gloss'
    varnish.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL NOTE: The areas you UV varnish won't appear 'dark gray'
    as in your sample. The UV varnish will actually make the 'black' ink appear more
    rich and shiny... almost like it's wet. If you changed the dark gray text to pure
    black it would be more true to the final piece.\r\n\r\nSomething like this...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gloss-UV-BLK_3662.jpg]"

    only had the text in grey to indicate to the users on here the parts i wanted
    varnished, i knew they wouldnt be grey upon output. \r\n\r\nive amended the invite
    so it looks closer to the final piece as u suggested. 100% black text on 96% black

    the rich, shiny look) a Spot Dull Varnish on the rest of the black paper ( to
    really bring out the shininess/contrast) and which regards to the white text,
    white ink on black? \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fashion-mischief-back2-THEONE-typo_4323.jpg]"

  body: hmmm ok the client doesnt like avenir, thinks its too round compared to the
    cover and also reminds him of Calibri ( font they use for emails) i like it however..  any
    suggestions to other type that might look equally well with the proposed printing
    technique and looks harmonious with  didot? im trying to find an alternative tyepface
    for mischief , like an italic, to give it that rebel factor
