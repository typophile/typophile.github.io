body: Can anyone tell me where to get the best version of Akzidenz Grotesk? When I
  was in school I had some Font Pusher student load like 9274908347 gigs of type onto
  my computer and with it came 928752 versions of the face. Now that I am a professional
  I would like to have a legal copy for my own use. I looked around but sometimes
  it's hard to decide with just web previews. Any suggestions?

    giving money to Harvey Hunt. No super weight for that one, tho."
