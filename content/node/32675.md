body: "I am currently writing a three-part article on type design for Unzipped (The
  Type Designer as Artist; The Type Designer as Craftsman; The Type Designer as Technician).
  Can anybody help me out with pictures of type designers doing what they do, which
  I could use to illustrate the article. It can be anything: sketching on paper, finished
  designs on paper, with or without notes, designing on screen, digitizing, whatever...\r\n\r\nImages
  should be at least 440 px wide and 100 to 500 px high (or bigger so I can resize).
  Please send them to [myfirstname][at]typographer[dot]org\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nYves"

    Fortunately I'm pretty sure I haven't been snagged in the wild, but I could send
    you a scan/photo of some Nour drawings - from the typical reaction to them I've
    concluded they're deceptively exotic!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I'd like at least a hand, shoulder, face, whatever body part* is involved
    in the design process included in the image. I want to stress as much as possible
    that type doesn't just appear magically on one's computer, but that living and
    breathing people put an incredible amount of effort and time into creating type.
    That's also why I'd like them to be living type designers, so the situation is
    as recognizable as possible.\r\n\r\n<em>* I sure hope there aren't any \"exotic\"
    type designers just like there are \"exotic dancers\"...</em> :^/"
