  are happy to announce that [[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/|Nitti]] has been
  updated to version 3.0. The major change in this new version is the addition of
  monotonic Greek.\r\nAlso some optimisations, such as a redrawn ampersand and a more
  distinctive zero, have been included after feedback from users of [[http://iawriter.com|iA
  Writer]], the popular new text editor on iPad and OS X.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/|Nitti]]
  is a monospaced typeface family in five weights that has its roots in the first
  sans-serif designs of the 19th century \u2013 the Grotesques. Originally a British
  invention, the Grotesques gained massive popularity in mainland Europe and also
  became widespread in early 20th century USA where it was commonly referred to as
  \u2018Gothic\u2019. The quirky and often idiosyncratic shapes of these designs lend
  them a humanity and warmth which is still widely appreciated.\r\n \r\n[[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/|Nitti]]
  comes in two versions. Nitti Basic offers 264 characters per font and only supports
  western European languages.\r\n\r\nThe full version of [[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/|Nitti]]
  on the other hand offers a generous 611 characters per font including many more
  accented letters, Greek and Cyrillic. This version covers all European languages
  together with most Asian languages that use the Cyrillic script.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate
  this launch we\u2019re offering more bundles and a [[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti_buy|special
  price of 129 Euros]] for the complete Nitti Basic family bundle.\r\n\r\nBest wishes
  from Den Haag!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.boldmonday.com|Bold Monday]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nitti3_580_typophile2_6674.png]"
