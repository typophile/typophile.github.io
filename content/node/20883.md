body: "I'm looking for a font similar to Whitney Index Black Round (Bold) that will
  support double digits through the font. Currently, Whitney only supports the numbers
  0-9 and any other numbers must be individually composed. Sans Serif is preferred,
  but ANY related font suggestions welcomed.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to Whitney Index
  Black Round (Bold)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMarty"

  body: A couple of the asian fonts included with CS2 have these as well. Both Kozuka
    Gothic Pro and Kozuka Mincho Pro have 1 through 100.
