  eye was the way umlaut was used in shop signs and in the Bayern M\xFCnchen shirts.
  The shirt one seemed very odd to me, hardly an umlaut!\r\n\r\nAre there fonts with
  umlauts inside the u, or is it just a clever way to keep signs neat and in uniform
  hight? Is this very common in German speaking countries?\r\n"

  body: "Hi Mili, thank you for posting these! Any chance you could upload the pictures
    to Flickr, and add them to our group that Frode and riccard0 linked to?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is
    this very common in German speaking countries?</blockquote>\r\nCounter question:
    Isn\u2019t this done in Finland? Finding creative solutions for diacritics that
    otherwise stick out of a blocky all-caps word image is not limited to German,
    or umlauts. It is also done with <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fontblog/2477282211/in/pool-fancy-diacritics\">tildes</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/patlejch/3878225502/in/pool-fancy-diacritics/\">h\xE1\u010Deks
    and acutes</a>, for example.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Are there fonts with umlauts inside
    the u?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes, there are a few*, but as far as I am concerned,
    there should be a lot more. Graphic designers obviously feel the need to fiddle
    around with fonts (convert to outlines, move the dots), in order to have vertically
    compact umlauts for tight and blocky all-caps settings. They shouldn\u2019t have
    to: type designers could provide display alternates, accessible via stylistic
    sets or the like.\r\n\r\n*) Some simply manage to keep the dots within cap height
    (<a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-63NRR3\">FB Nobel</a>), some are more fancy, with
    a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/verticalumlaut/\">vertical arrangement</a>
    and/or with the dots inside the counter (<a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-lGFe5K\">Mahlau</a>).
    Others have display alternates that look cramped, and, in older pre-OT fonts,
    are encoded poorly (<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/bernhard_antique_sh_bold_condensed_ot/?&sample_text=H%C3%84H%C3%96H%C3%9CH%5EH%7BH%7D&sample_size=48\">Bernhard
    Antique</a>). Thomas Phinney\u2019s <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-LhKZRA\">Hypatia
    Sans</a> is a modern typeface family that provides space-saving alternates via
    OpenType. You can get them by activating Stylistic Set 12. For the Black weight,
    the two dots have been arranged vertically.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>People write this
    way quite often there.</blockquote>\r\nTrue. But there\u2019s a huge difference
    between handwriting, and lettering and typography. Here are some of the macron-like
    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/swissumlaut/\">\u2018Swiss umlauts\u2019</a>
    that we have collected."

    the thing: do the fonts they do this to already have a non-descending \"Q\" (and
    \"J\")? When not, one has to suspect it's merely playfulness at best, and typical
    graphic designer look-at-me-too affectation at worst.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you everyone! I've added the pictures I took to the pool, the shirt
    isn't mine, so I couldn't add that.\r\n\r\nIs the use of vertical umlauts relatively
    new phenomenon? I lived in Munich for an year in the 90's and don't remember seeing
    those. Mind you, I wasn't quite as interested in them as I am now, but I'm sure
    I would've noticed them.\r\n\r\nAs for diacritics in Finland, we have \xC4, \xD6
    and \xC5, and their diacritics are often dropped down or otherwise embedded, especially
    in newspaper headlines. Sometimes with \xC4 and \xD6 people replace the dots with
    a macron like line (esp. in handwriting), which in theory changes the letter,
    but as macron is not used in Swedish or Finnish, it doesn't cause confusion.\r\n\r\nThen
    there's this one font that was never id'd, an unusual approach (scroll to the
    end for a close-up):\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29532"

    are many fonts with a non-descending J to choose from, and B) the letters J and,
    especially, Q are among the rarest in German spelling. It is a lot more likely
    to run in one of the three umlauted vowels than in one of these two letters.\r\n\r\nRalf
    (and Georg), Nick, thanks for making these typefaces, and bringing them to my
    mind. Excellent!"

    point. Especially since -as you already noted- graphic designers typically don't
    modify the ascending caps in an actual font, they simply modify a particular (and
    relatively short) rendering of the font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
