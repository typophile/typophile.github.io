  body: "JP, thanks for the larger sample. Alas, WhatTheFont still coming up without
    a match.\r\n\r\nHmmm, yeah, Gringo Tuscan is definitely close--I just wish it
    didn't have those weird spiky bits coming off the midpoints of all the characters."

  body: Hi. the title fonts for Goodbye Madame Butterfly are Parker Slab for "Goodbye"
    and Parker for "Madame Butterfly." If you have the book, check out the very last
    page after the acknowledgments, where designer Craig Mod lists all the fonts used
    in the book. Cheers, Bruce
