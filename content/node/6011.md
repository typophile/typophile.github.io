  u should sort them out in to different folders. <BR> <BR>for example: <BR> <BR>Serif
  <BR>Sans serif <BR>Script <BR>Display/Headline <BR>Stencil <BR>Bitmap/web <BR> <BR>maybe
  someone got a better structure? '

  body: I organize my typefaces by foundry. I&#39;m basically aware of the quality
    of each foundry and prefer not to mix them. I tried organizing them a long long
    time ago into similar categories as you, Christoffer, but found that to be a little
    confusing when trying to use the correct foundries version of the typefaces. Although,
    obviously, naming conventions don&#39;t allow that to happen very often. I guess
    I&#39;m a foundry snob.

    sans, display, etc.

  body: 'The Germans, in some sort of inner quest for order, have devised means to
    classify almost everything even vaguely industrial. Including typefaces. Also
    not surprising is that there are two DIN classification models, an older &#40;longer&#41;
    one and a newer one. An article briefly describing them is available via the following
    link, in German only <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    target="_blank">http://www.typolexikon.de/s/schriftklassifikation-din.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Below is the older, longer system &#40;please excuse my quick translation&#41;:
    <BR>01. Venetian Renaissance Serif &#40;i.e., Centaur or Bembo&#41; <BR>02. French
    Renaissance Serif &#40;i.e., Garamond&#41; <BR>03. Baroque Serif &#40;Janson and
    the Dutch Romans&#41; <BR>04. Neo-Classical Serifs &#40;i.e., Bodoni&#41; <BR>05.
    Slab Serifs &#40;Egyptiennes&#41; <BR>06. Sans Serifs &#40;e.g., AG&#41; <BR>07.
    Variations on the Serifed Letter Theme <BR>08. Handwriting-like Typefaces &#40;i.e.,
    Mistral&#41; <BR>09. Caligraphic Serif Typefaces <BR>10. Blackletter &#40;there
    are at least four sub-families here&#41; <BR>11. Foreign Writing Systems &#40;i.e.,
    Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Kanji, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>And here is the newer,
    current system: <BR>1. Blackletter Faces <BR>2. Traditional Serif Faces <BR>3.
    Sans Serif Faces <BR>4. Slab Serif Faces <BR>5. Handwritten-like Faces'

  body: 'There is also the Bringhurst System &#40;Hans Peter Willberg has developed
    a similar system in German that covers both serifs and sans serifs equally extensively...
    but I don&#39;t have that book of his handy&#41;: <BR> <BR>1. Renaissance <BR>2.
    Baroque <BR>3. Neo-Classical &#40;unlike the DIN system, this is for Transitional
    faces&#41; <BR>4. Romantic &#40;he puts the Didones here&#41; <BR>5. Realist &#40;AG&#41;
    <BR>6. Geometric Modernist &#40;Futura&#41; <BR>7. Lyrical Modernist <BR>8. Postmodernist
    <BR> <BR>This mirrors movements in Art, of course...'

  body: Having just listed three differen, time-based classification systems, I should
    point out don&#39;t I don&#39;t use any of them. I <b>try</b> to organize my faces
    in folders by project &#40;using type-managing software&#41;. This doesn&#39;t
    always work. So, I end up often trying to sort my faces by country &#40;and then
    often in sub-categories for designers&#41;. I like this method a lot. Its fun
    to think that Alte Schwabacher, Fette Fraktur, AG, and Meta are all <i>equally</i>
    German... and put put everything American under one roof... that&#39;s just a
    blast, especially when Dwiggins comes right before Emigre.

  body: I took me some time to discover what works best to me, but I have them organized
    by foundry. Have another folder called Collections on the same level where I collect
    some fonts grouped by various flavours. I also think that there is no need to
    group the fonts inside the foundry, rather pointless when you can have have My
    fonts/Font Book etc to look the font name/designer etc and get it on you hard
    disk with a few clicks. Why order it into families?Save clicks, it extends your
    life. Inside each Foundry I have 2 dirs, PC and MAC version. <BR> <BR>BTW, are
    you a font backup fanatic? Do you have several backups? just the hard disk copy?

    Just curious.

  body: Ok... i understand there&#39;s many different ways <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I think what suits me best at last must be the one i mentioned,
    but maybe with some more alternatives as Tracy wrote. In those folders i only
    put my favourites or fonts that i think are good enough to use. Just to narrow
    my search when i shall find the best font for that specific moment. <BR> <BR>About
    the backup, well i wish i did backup more often but i got almost the same collection
    both home and on my work so i guess i wont loose them at the same time.... i hope

  body: Backup is VERY important. I had a disk crash 2 years ago and I had to pay
    something like 2200US$ to recover the disc content &#40;1 year Work &#43; fonts
    included&#41;. Since then I have a 2 disc RAID mirror system. $hit Happens. <BR>
    <BR>On the collections folder I&#39;ve mentioned I have my common/current fonts,
    which is something like 10 fonts I use the most. Organization does change from
    person to person. As long as you don&#39;t get lost and canfind a font in 20 sec
    I would say you are well organized :P <BR> <BR>Dan, nice! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
