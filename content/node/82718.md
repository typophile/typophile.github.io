body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nLooking for this typeface. It's the e that defines it different
  to any of the other common sans-serifs. Could it possibly be a custom e?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  not many symbols to play with.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: Yeah, it looks to me like Helvetica that, in anticipation of the printing
    conditions, has had its e opened up a bit.
