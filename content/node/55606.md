  body: "i really like your personal mark but much more before web2.0/gradients hit
    it \r\n\r\ni dont dislike the dark layout, however i went right to the bright
    layout  \r\nas it was less distracting and easier to see your work more quickly\r\n\r\nthe
    same goes for the colors of the tabs on each project (yellow/blue)\r\nless distraction
    from your work would let it shine more\r\n\r\nits nice"
