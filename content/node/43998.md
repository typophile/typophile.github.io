  it.  I stumbled on this ultra bargain software sight that I would question if its
  legitimate or a scam, possibly piracy. They say they sell so cheaply because they
  don't send packaging or disks. I'm skeptical. Anybody have experience with sites
  like these?\r\n"

    have not included the link to it for others to make an informed answer\r\n"

    the folks at FontLab to make them aware of the situation. Please do not post the
    URL here.

  body: Most of these type of sites claim to sell OEM software and most of the time,
    it's a lie.

  body: "It was listed as OEM software at $49.99.\r\nI agrre about not posting the
    URL. I thought I had, but just now getting back online realize I didn't. Now I'm
    glad I forgot. The link is in my history at home and I will try to post it to
    FL tonight for their review. I was under the impression that FL was a download
    only program so I doubt they could be doing buyouts on overstocks of it.\r\n"

  body: 'Very few software software companies actually sell OEM software to your average
    vendor (if at all). Those that do offer OEM software will typically only sell
    it to hardware vendors for bundling and, even then, it''s usually a crippled version
    of the software anyways. '
