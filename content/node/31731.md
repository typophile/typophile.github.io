body: When designing grids, do you prefer to design a grid suited to the type and
  then add margins to create a page, or do you create a grid to fit a chosen page
  size?

  body: For me, it makes more sense to work the grid with the final size.

  body: I agree - I create the grid based on the trim size and the various elements
    of the design and then style the type to suit the grid. I can't really imagine
    why you'd do it the other way round.

  body: "its probably because im computer kid and learned designing on a computer,
    but i normaly just fiddle around till it fits my needs. i normaly know how complicated
    the grid has to be (depending on if its a simple flyer, a 80 page magazine or
    a white paper with survey results).\r\n\r\nmargins on the other hand are fitted
    to the needs of paper size, type of binding, type of publication. i just made
    a student project with 5mm margin on all sides, but thats because it had to be
    like that conceptual-wise.\r\n\r\nthe grid itself was really simple, 9x12 lines
    to get nearly square grid blocks. the paper size was 20x25cm, also because it
    fitted the needs (both production- and conceptual-wise).\r\n\r\nim not sure how
    much this helps to answer your question, but i dont think there's a golden way
    how to do it - sometimes i know exactly what i want and just try to find a grid
    fitting my needs, and sometimes i experiment until i find margins/a grid that
    fit the project."
