  \ I would like some help IDing the types, so I am appealing to the collective wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe
  jpegs are small, but I will hope that some of you are familiar with the products...you
  can also look at them at http://sites.target.com/site/en/supertarget/page.jsp?title=brands&brand=archerFarms\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!  Do any of you know a website that could be useful for IDing?  Like
  a 20 questions for typeface, entering yes/no or parameters for line, weight, etc.?"
