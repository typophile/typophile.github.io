  to use a font called \"Blue Jeans\" at my previous work place. If I remember correctly,
  it is a Type1 font, but I am not 100% on that one.\r\n\r\nSo, if anyone has any
  information at all about \"Blue Jeans\" (foundry / who made it / where can it be
  bought), then I would appreciate hearing it. I haven't been able to even come up
  with anything proofing this font's existance through google, although I remember
  using it for several DVD covers.\r\n\r\nInformation that I remember:\r\n- Blue Jeans
  (100% sure about name)\r\n- It is a trashy font. We found it suitable on the covers
  for horror movies and such.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJohan"

    It\u2019s a knock off of Revue."
