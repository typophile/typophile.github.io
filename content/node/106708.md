  process, but it would be more flexible if a command-line tool existed that did the
  same thing at at least nearly the same quality.\r\nI've tried FontForge and it doesn't
  do such a good job on some TTFs I've tested. Sometimes it doesn't even convert the
  outlines to PS and the end/starting node(s) are not aligned properly but instead
  off by a few pixels creating an ugly jagged effect :/ Unfortunately also most online
  font converters do the same thing (bad quality).\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Can be a program/script
  (ie. python) and run on Win/Mac/Linux no problem, I got all three OS's :)"

  body: Why do you need to convert them at all? There are very few reasons that I
    can think of why this should be necessary.

  body: "Jens, as I understand it, MS Word will not use OpenType features with a ttf
    font unless the font has a digital signature. Expensive. However, with Word, the
    same font will use the same OT features if the font is in otf format.\r\n\r\nAll
    more evidence for the hypothesis that there is (currently) no intelligent life
    beyond earth, because within 250 years of discovering radio wave communications,
    any species self-destructs."

  body: It seems to have dribbled out of the documentation, but FontForge can append
    a dummy digital signature. Dunno if it's still Good Enough, though. I think it's
    also possible with ttx.

    do the trick. One can generate one with for instance FontForge and just copy it
    to other TTF fonts. At DTL we use OTM for this, of course, but surely there are
    other tools for this purpose too. I don\u2019t know whether it is available still,
    but quite some time ago the free command-line utility <em>Addtable.exe</em> worked
    for us as well.\r\n\r\nFEB"
