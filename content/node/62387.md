body: "I find that what makes my design senses tingle with joy are places that exist
  whch are \"ripe\" for placing type there....a book cover, a poster, a car, a shirt,
  a field or forest. Conversely, environments that already have many placed letterforms,
  makes me feel the most uncomfortable and oppressed ...bookstores...Adbusters magazine.
  \ Yikes!! I have to look at the floor the whole time, and I become short of breath.
  \ \r\n\r\nMaybe there should be an artistic movement that takes down advertisements
  and removes words where they uglify the spaces we inhabit.\r\n\r\nI dunno, just
  a duality I've noticed... I want to create, and yet I hate looking at created things.
  \ \r\n\r\nMasterful things I love to look at.  Maybe its the amount of attention
  masterfully created thing demand. My attention can be set and explore a masterpiece.
  \ Where as bookstore seems more like a cacophony of various styles of music being
  sung at different volumes. "
