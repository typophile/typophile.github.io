		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the 'top-down' orientation. (I'm an American and a lefty, if that's relevant.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My rationale for my visual preference (beyond any theories about my physiological/ geographic biases) is in 2 parts: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) If I'm not mistaken, readers' eyes move across the tops of letterforms (lowercase), along with examining the word shapes formed by the acsenders and descenders. The top-down allows more air space (so to speak) for the eye to read the forms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) The window frame acts like a sitting point for the type. To my eye (and therefore my mind), the type feels 'seated' on the left, as though it's using the wooden frame as a base. Its placement looks more considered to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A caveat: upon second (and subsequent) glances, the righthand one feels more active to me, as though it's moving up, rather than sitting nicely still. If you're looking for a more active, irreverent, young, (blah, blah, you get where I'm going) appearance, the righthand may end up serving your purposes better. Use the potential difference from the 'norm' to your advantage.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ultimately, I agree with Jacques' first post, just ask some people you trust in the office about it informally.

		<div class="commentbody">Good morning from Finland. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I am used to, left eye up, reading down. It also makes marketing sense if a book lies cover up to produce them in that fashion. At least some sense.

Also about my earlier observation, I would not make things easy for those folk that look in your window!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So that said.

		<div class="commentbody">there is a paragraph on Binding in 'Designing Books' Hochull, Kinross: Hypen Press. pg 101 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it suggests if the spine is broad enough to have it horizontal. then goes on to say:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'If they are vertical, traditionally in German-language books text runs from the bottom up (except on large-format volumes that are laid front cover up in the bookshelf, so that the spine title can be read normally).

		<div class="commentbody">Vincent, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the most part I agree. But, more often than not, it is impossible to run the name of the volume horizontal. Also you probably can read the book title from the cover when lying down. A stack of magazines? The top one, stack of books the top one. But books tend to have more personality than magazines. Well. at least that's the way it was in my day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Besides, I do not subscribe to the theory that just because you are left handed, you are left eyed, or visa versa. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also I am not sure we can move our heads to the left or right any easier. My old noggin just gets dizzy no matter how I look at it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kids, be kind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I figure we just read from left to right. There are those that don't. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we rotate our heads to the position of &quot;left eye up&quot;, that eye is closer to the beginning of the text because it is up. If printed the opposite way, then the opposite is true. Unless we tilt our head the other way and theoretically all things become equal. Assuming, naturally, that the head is central to the text. Have you ever noticed how difficult it is reading the spines tight against the wall. My books closest to the wall left, I keep my books that are right reading upwards. My right reading downwards books I keep closest to the right hand wall. Try it, you will thank me later. Especially when you are as old as me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, still we have those stairs, I think you may fall down if you choose the picture on the left, increasing liability insurance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So still, I stick to my position, at least for now, with sign as illustrated in the right hand picture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think, it was the right hand picture.

		<div class="commentbody">Allright guys! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you all for your thoughts, it really is an interesting matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is how I decided to do it - in the middle left window, reading upward, aligned to the top right of the window. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Motivation: if you look on Google-images for conference stand, very large corporate banners etc, the all go upward. I do think the reason for this is the downward=negative and upward=positive explanation. I think the book spine is just a different discussion, although personally, being from The Netherlands, I am used to downward titles, and also the point that it's readable when the book is on its back seems logical to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But since this signage is more like the &quot;vertical text on a big object&quot; matter than a title on a book cover, I choose the upward option. Also consider that the windows are very big, the text as you see it in the picture is almost 1 meter high! The alignment changed because think the text should have some ground under its feet, so its now grounded on the right side of the window.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the advice and the food for thought!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">caspar, I think you've found the right solution! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as titles on spines go, I just found the following bit in Marshall Lee's 'Bookmaking':  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;&hellip;it is a fact that italics and cursives are much more easily read from bottom to top. This position is actually less of a departure from the normal horizontal arrangement for them than it is for roman type, the latter being perpendicular to the normal angle, wheras italics are turned considerably less than 90</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For the most part you design with rules. But the rules don't make the design. More often than not I would prefer the work of a non designer following well established typographical rules than a bad designer abusing them or working without knowledge. Admittedly however, some brilliant designs are successful by playing with, or teasing both the rules and their makers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This particular problem, I believe, has no traditionally established rules. Maybe one, running stacking type downwards, are to some, an offence. But this specific design problem has irritated many in the past. Solutions are only to be found by compromise of established reading habits and therefore reasonably, leads to, as we can see, &quot;individual&quot; solutions.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;individual solution&quot; is Caspar's, he is the designer, and he shows us his solution. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And from what I can make of it, a good one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now I could say what I would do, however that would be my solution, not representative of Caspar. His individual solution is of paramount importance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerald Giampa <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P.S. Hope you got insurance.
