body: Hi I'd like to get some feedback on this composition. I am going for a 1930's
  spiritualism/magician/mentalist feel using period type in a woodblock printing style.
  I want to work in black and white only for now. I'd love to get some feedback on
  what could be improved. The verbage for the central text is not established yet
  so I haven't filled it in. The part I am feeling least sure about is the outside
  text but they want this phrase incorporated somehow. Also, I realize only part of
  it is currently distressed but I have to have finalization on the rest of the text
  before doing so. Any and all comments are warmly welcomed. Thank you.
