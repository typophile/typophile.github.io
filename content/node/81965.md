  at the top of a front page of a newspaper; I've recently found that masthead actually
  means something different (list of staff), and that I should be using the term \"heading.\"
  This seems like a rather broad term, though. Is there a specific term for this section
  at the top of the front page with the logo, tagline, date, etc?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "Actually the word \"masthead\" applies to both. \r\n\r\nAccording to Webster,
    the first definition is nautical; the second definition applies to newspapers/newsletters,
    with sub-definitions of a & b, with b being defined as the newspaper name at the
    top of the front page. It further mentions that the front page masthead is also
    called \"nameplate\".\r\n\r\nI've always used the word \"masthead\" to indicate
    the logo on the front page, but either use is correct.\r\n\r\nI agree that \"nameplate\"
    is best in order to avoid confusing people."
