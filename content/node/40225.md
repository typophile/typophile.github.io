  body: "This reminds me...\r\n\r\nSome time ago we mastered some Arabic OT fonts
    for a client. They supplied the outline data, some of which had been around the
    block in other font formats for several decades, and we built TTFs and added OpenType
    Layout tables. Fairly typical bread-and-butter work for us. I was bemused when
    we received marketing feedback that the design of the asterisks in the fonts needed
    to be changed from six-pointed to five-pointed, for 'cultural reasons'.\r\n\r\nAdam,
    that slide is clearly a Zionist conspiracy. :)"
