body: "I am currently beginning a project to rebrand a small fine furniture business.
  Most of the work is high design wooden pieces, the focal point being the wood most
  times.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we are moving away from the craft feel, to better
  capture the refinement of his business and convey these pieces as art, rather than
  craft \u2013\_which they most certainly are!\r\n\r\nHe leans towards the modernist
  approach, which is great as I tend to as well. However, as I have fallen behind
  on a lot of current faces, I thought someone may be able to recommend a few fonts
  that I may benefit from seeing / comparing.\r\n\r\nProbably going sans serif on
  this one, but was hoping for a slightly rougher / humanist sans... if there is such
  a thing! Trying to avoid slabs even, and a heavier weight is ideal.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance."

  body: Surely why not, however as I said, probably gunning for a nice sans serif,
    I appreciate the suggestion though. Perhaps as a secondary, but probably will
    not fly.

    your point Nick, his current type / logo is Papyrus! \r\n\r\nI suppose to revise
    this inquiry, I would not say Humanist, just a slightly rougher nice sans out
    there, if there is anything that has come around of late.\r\n\r\nUnderstandable
    to let this post rest though I suppose. Thanks."

    quality \"serif\").\r\nFutura, Helvetica, Univers, Gill Sans, Fruriger, Meta,
    Rotis, Eurostile... Scala.\r\nMaybe also Avant Garde sounds good on wooden surfaces.\r\nBut
    if you're looking for something \"rougher\" you must use a serif. Mantinia by
    Matthew Carter, is perfect!\r\n\r\ncf\r\n"

    designed by Eric Gill) to be a little rougher then the humanists of today. I would
    suggest you do a search for humanists in the new MyFonts site. You'll surely find

    before your last paragraph \u2014 was a geometric sans like Futura or Neutraface,

  body: "Thank you all for the suggestions. I understand the question was a bit \"off,\"
    and some of the responses (especially mine) reinforced that I was not sure exactly
    where I was headed. \r\n\r\nI guess by rough / modernist, I actually meant not
    flawlessly resolved. I commented on Neutra not because I thought it met these
    specific criteria, but because it seemed to be an alternate approach to type for
    this... to the rougher idea anyway. Since most of his pieces are very architectural,
    it seemed appropriate due to it's inspirations / style.\r\n\r\nThat being said,
    there was one suggestion that won it for me... can't seem to locate it now, but
    it was the type with blown out (not sure the name, but the ink overflow allowance
    things for letters) but designed to extremes. That, to me read rougher, and a
    bit more unique in the sans world, and spoke to \"process,\" which was my goal.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end, all proved to scarily offensive to him to purchase, so back to working
    with Berthold Akzidenz... which I love, and will work, just not quite as custom.
    \r\n\r\nThank you all for your suggestions, and sorry I was a bit here and there
    on it!"

    It's not a sans though, and I'm not sure it's available, but may be worth havin'
    a look at.
