  body: Well, the bottom left-hand one is the only one where you can read the information
    without something getting in the way, although the type could be a bit bigger.
    Maybe at high resolution and actual size, the top right-hand one might work, too.
    Make it easy for the reader to get the information, and maybe there will be people
    at the concert!

  body: I&#39;m not in love with the type being forced to flush left and right. Did
    you try stacking the title and taking the second line and placing it somewhere
    else on the poster? This way you could make the type work more with the image
    and not become separated from it. Last, I think the headline is set too tight.
    It looks very 70s, just too much crashing. Did you try Initial cap and lower case?

  body: thank you for both for your comments,in one hand i also think the top right
    one and the bottom left one are the better ones, but in the other hand i think
    that in the top right poster our vision gets distracted with those two horizontal
    lines, and in the bottom right poster maybe the type is a bit small &#40;this
    way the type finishes were the diagonal line starts&#41;, a good thing in this
    or at least better than the first is that the type is in the line of streangth
    between the black an the green/white area and as Steve said &#34;you can read
    the information without something getting in the way&#34;. <BR>stacking the title
    is a very good idea i never thought in doing it, as also the ideia of placing
    the second line in another place,&#40;i was trying to &#34;make&#34; a rectangle
    with the type thats why the type is &#34;forced&#34;&#41;, inicialy i did try
    initial cap and lower case but i give up on that because of the rectangle idea...
    <BR>both gave me lots of stuff to think about, i think im going with the second
    poster after some changes.. <BR>txs again!

  body: I like the top left, <BR>because that image is very cool <BR>and I would keep
    the vertical direction <BR>of the text &#40;visually you already have <BR>three
    horizontal areas&#41;. I like it white <BR>&#40;light&#41; but I will play some
    trick to <BR>increase the contrast, pro legibility. <BR>AS

  body: 'i also like the two first ones, maybe the second because of the red letters&#40;is
    better to read&#41; but the first should work well with a little bit of contrast
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    and is cheaper&#40;because theres no red paint&#41;. i need to work on those first
    posters to, but for now this is the final poster! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    need nothing more  <BR>than to follow the movement  <BR>of the image. <BR> <BR>I
