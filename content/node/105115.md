  offer regarding my first font. I intend on using it to break into the type design
  industry and have been tweaking it constantly. I think the time has come for other,
  more experienced, eyes to have a go.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo1_4135.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo2_5773.jpg]"

    is a new alphabet set with heavier curves to visually balance with the straight
    strokes. I've also adjusted the weight of the terminals in the /G/ /C/ /c/ /S/
    & /s/ to help them at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo3_5801.jpg]"

    and lessened the contrast greatly. Some of the emphasis was mis-angled on a few
    of the lowercase bowls, and I think I've gotten a handle on that. Feeling better
    about this now.\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ferd-rnd2_5894.jpg]"

  body: "Very respectable for a first font!\r\n\r\nSome letters feel too wide to me;
    {u h z E F M Z} in particular. You seem to have a different arch design in {h}
    than in {n m u}; the latter look better in my opinion. Your previous {g} seemed
    more in character than the new open one. The {t} is a bit timid. {C G} look like
    they bit into a lemon; maybe relax their apertures a bit?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    the width and apertures of the letters. I've always wanted to find a chart of
    standard widths of letters as they relate to the m. If you know of anything, I
    would appreciate it. Will post some revisions soon.\r\n\r\nConrad"

    trick is in learning to see and balance the counter spaces. If you look at the
    beginning of \"phonmusik\" in that last image, the /o/ captures less interior
    space area-wise than the /p/, and the /p/ less than the /h/. The closer those
    are to visually balanced, the better. No chart needed, just your eyes!"

  body: Thanks again. I hadn't thought to compare the counters. I suppose designing
    the white is as important as the black.

  body: "Really nice font :)\r\n\r\nSince the first image has sentences with Romanian
    diacritics (my language), may I say that while the distance between them and the
    letter is good (so keep it the same) the comma-accent of lowercase |\u021B| and
    |\u0219| are too heavy \u2013 they should be a bit smaller \u2013 around 90% or
    even 80%, I'd say. (And FYI, most of the time the comma-accent diacritical mark
    should be smaller than the \"regular\" comma anyway).\r\n\r\nAlso, the circumflex
    of |\xE2| should be nudged a bit to the right, to be centered to the upper extrema
    point of |a|.\r\n\r\ncheers  :)"

  body: "Bogdan, thanks for the great feedback on the diacritics. I'm currently working
    on a more decorative font based on a specific sample of Romanian Orthodox I found
    in Galati. I'll look you up for a review when it's ready.\r\n\r\n(looking at your
    profile rang a bell, I just drove by this sign a month ago. Next time, I'll stop
    and buy you a drink)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sebessign_5285.png]\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Nice start, hope you're still working on this. \r\n\r\n- n and h are still
    quite wide.\r\n- I suggest horizontally flipping the top serif of d.\r\n- You
    have a lot of curved detailing going on. Not sure I like all of them.\r\n- Thickness
    of serifs is inconsistent. Compare the bottom serif of u to the top ones.\r\n-
    The bottom of g looks a bit out of tune to me, shape-wise. Too futuristic-like\r\n-
    middle stem in m needs a serif\r\n- t is really narrow."

  body: Thanks for the pointers Jasper. I haven't looked at this in a while for the
    sake of being able to look at it again with fresh eyes. I agree with your comments,
    and will be re-evaluating probably most-if-not-all of the other characters as
    well.
