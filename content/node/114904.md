  of Fiddler on the Roof?  The show's logo is done by hand (and follows the style
  of several of the classic Fiddler logos) so I can't just use what the logo designer
  used.  \r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nJ F F "

    be good, or something evocative of the period....\r\n\r\nPerhaps Jenson Oldstyle
