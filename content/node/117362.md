    exact font family name I have is \"2 BlockParty DNA\", the site reports 2005 as

  body: "Good enough for me Fivos. I'm happy to learn that you saw nothing similar
    from another source. The fonts that Luc Devroye attributes to Dave Simpson are
    about as good a collection of original show-card style fonts as I have seen anywhere.\r\nDon"

title: Looking for font used on the sign in this image. I believe the "Jose's" and
  "Mexican Restaurant" are the same font. If anyone could tell me the font for "Authentic"
  also that would be a bonus!
