body: "After years of admiring, but not truly understanding, good design, I've decided
  to learn the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nI enrolled in two online classes at Foothill College,
  the local junior college.  The first is on color, taught by Linda Lum, using gouache
  and Color Aid paper.  The second is on design, taught by Carolyn Brown, using Photoshop,
  Illustrator, and InDesign.\r\n\r\nMy previous years of higher education have been
  immersed in physics, biology, and medicine, so this is a completely different paradigm
  of learning. The concept and practice of creative exercises and group critiques
  is completely new to me.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I've been reading blogs and books about
  typography and grid systems.\r\n\r\nMy favorite sites:\r\nhttp://www.ilovetypography.com\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com
  (obviously)\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com\r\n\r\nSo far, my book collection includes:\r\n-
  Rookledge's International Fontfinder\r\n- Robert Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic
  Design \r\n- Thinking with Type, by Ellen Lupton\r\n\r\nLast night, I went to a
  Sharks game with my husband, and while he cheered on the home team, I happily took
  in all the advertising designs on the LED screens.  \r\n"
