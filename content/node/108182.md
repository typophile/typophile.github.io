  In my attachment, this sans serif I'm curious about is saying \"UNIVERSITY CANADA\".
  \r\n\r\nI've attached it low res by itself and also hi res as part of the greater
  logo graphic design.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help. If it might be a custom font (like
  their serif saying \"Western\" now is), the closest suggestion would be appreciated.\r\n"
