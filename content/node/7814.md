  body: Hi Ryan, <BR> <BR>It has a nice visual style, but only two links to external
    sites. In short, I think it needs more stuff, more content.

  body: I like the site. The Trade Gothic &#39;work&#39; titles look blurry to me,
    though. Actually, a lot of the type feels over compressed or anti-aliased a bit
    too much. <BR> <BR>I definitely like your little tagline over the TV. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
