  in Aboriginal art, so I wanted it to maintain an indigenous feel, both in colour
  and symbolism, while still remaining attractive to an overseas (mainly German and
  Holland) corporate market.\r\n\r\nThe gallery will also serve as a store/gallery
  for tourists.\r\n\r\nThe symbol is called a Journey Circle, as I wanted to avoid
  using a literal translation of a foot.\r\n\r\nI am not very confident in my ability
  to kern so I need help in making this visually balanced. So far FOOTSTEPS is looking
  inconsistant. But I cannot put my finger on it.\r\n\r\nhelp..."

    is great!\r\n\r\nI love how theyre not perfect circles, which is absolutely relevant
    to aboriginal art.\r\n\r\nVery good take and awesome overall job so far!"
