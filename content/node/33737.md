  body: "Katja, you have to understand that the numbers and letters on licence plates
    are not fonts, but alphabets that were specifically designed for the stamping
    machines that make those plates. This means these alphabets are specific to the
    manufacturing method they were designed for. There are no equivalents that exist
    as (digital) typefaces for general use.\r\n\r\nSome of these licence plate alphabets
    were digitised and made into fonts, but not all of them. Apart from the aforementionned
    Lineto versions of the Italian, Swiss, Belgian and French licence plate fonts,
    both [[Lineto]] and [[Fountain]] digitised the German plates (but Fountain did
    <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/sauerkrauto.asp\">a far better job</a>
    than Lineto IMHO), [[Christian Schwartz]] did the <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/pennsylvania.shtml\">Pennsylvanian
    one</a>. [[Conor Mangat]]'s <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=115\">Platelet</a>
    is loosely based on the Californian licence plates. And <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=carplates&q=Go\">ACME
    Carplates</a> brought the British plates into the digital realm (Lineto had that
    one as well, but Mitsubishi Motors Europe acquired exclusive license for the Alpha
    Headline fonts for the duration of ten years, expiring at the end of 2012)."
