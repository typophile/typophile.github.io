  body: This sign is on a wall in Copenhagen, so Danish. But judging by the orthography,
    it's quite old. Don't have the resources with me now to try to identify the type,
    unfortunately.

  body: "Just wanted to make certain that this was not some new \"break the rules\"
    font.\r\nI love the quirks in the lettering, including an _r_ that I have not
    seen before. The heavy serifs on the _s_ -- Egyptian style -- are completely different
    from the other pointed wedge serifs -- Latin style. Some letters use a Didot style
    hairline for some of the strokes. Other letters are low contrast.\r\nMy opinion
    is that this is a local sign-painter's  lettering which is not based on any particular
    font but has a little something for people with various tastes and is customized
    to resolve designl problems. Note in particular,  the _g_ with the clipped lower
    bowl that fits directly over the top of _f_.\r\nDon"
