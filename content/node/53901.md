  in Midcity\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI am putting up this collection of signs because
  I don't feel that three images offer enough variety. New Orleans has long been known
  for it's culture. And for a culture to exist, there has to be some lasting influences
  to make it a culture and not a fad. Here are some examples of classic signage with
  some random signs from the New Orleans area. An interesting observation is that
  New Orleans has always been known for the food, and the majority of these photos
  are of restaurants. I got so caught up in taking the photos though, that I didn't
  realize they were all from restaurants until I uploaded them here.\r\n\r\nI noticed
  that most of these signs use a sans serif type for the main text and may accentuate
  it with a scripty typeface as a second or third level of hierarchy. I hate to be
  the one to criticize classics, but without pointing out specific signs, many of
  them could use a little love, especially with kerning. I also notice that the signs
  with darker backgrounds and light text tend to be easier to read than dark text
  over light. Maybe that's because you generally look up into the bright sky and the
  dark background gives the sign a ground on which to reinforce its message."
