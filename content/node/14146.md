  gear for backboards. Can't really say what that will be, but stuff. They want to
  attract college basketball fans.  And people who play basketball.\r\n\r\nI've tried
  a few other directions but I like the type on this best.  It takes the form of the
  backboard and translates it into type.  At least that is what I was trying to do.
  HOOP has gone through a couple drafts.\r\n\r\nThe FX mark part I am just getting
  to.  I think I need to try a few different renderings before this starts working.
  \ I think the bottom of the mark is the tricky part...that will impact how FX reads.\r\n\r\nWould
  love to hear what you all think. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I quite like the type. I think it will appeal to the demographic. Maybe try
    adjusting the tips of the \"H\" and \"P\" to be less angular and more like the
    \"O\"s.\r\n\r\nAlso, the H and P's tips might be too high considering there location.
    I might shave a bit off them too see what it looks like.\r\n\r\nHow 'bout setting
    \"FX\" onto basketball's spherical surface? Perhaps rebounding off the \"backboard\"
    of one of the \"O\"s?\r\n\r\nGood start."

  body: "'FX' is readng as a cropped 'EX' to me.\r\n\r\nMaybe try Tim's idea, or perhaps
    make the 'FX' take up the same space as the traditional box on the backboard.\r\n\r\nThe
    backboard also seems a bit small compared to the type. "

    sure if my inner angles on the H and the P are spot on.  Though they are based
    off the outer angles and optically adjusted.  \r\n\r\n?"

    is missing something.  Or perhaps it needs to be executed in another way. Though
    the client does like the idea of some sort of basketball-based mark.\r\n\r\nOpen
    to suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    in no way final

    \"F\" and \"X\" into the backboard of the Os. Since all backboards have a square
    of tape in that location, it seems like a natural fit. Feel free to post/develop/use.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.splashdesign.com/temp/typofile/hoopfx/hoopfx.gif\r\n\r\n

    body: "Some good ideas there from tim and eben.\r\n\r\nI started to add some outlines
      and color, but still not satisfied though it could work\r\n\r\nI have some ideas
      that remove FX from the mark that I might try, and I think tim's idea has some
      potential, though it might not reduce well (have a feeling it won't). But I
      like the idea of a wordmark, instead of a mark + logotype.\r\n\r\nAnd eben,
      I think I will explore yours as well.\r\n\r\nI'll keep you posted.\r\n"

    off a paper on the flooe & then start erasing - or take the image to computer
    & manipulate.\r\n\r\nThis idea is a bit x-treme sports though... Maybe not the
