  first image I found in a Japanese anime website, in a wallpaper. The second image
  I found while watching an anime fansub.\r\n\r\nI've tried Identifont and WhatTheFontFont?!,
  both didn't give me what I'm looking for, I guess this is a pretty rare font? Thanks
  in advance if any of you identify this font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/miyoko_6654.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/poplardon_3695.png]"

  body: "It's possible these are from Japanese fonts that also have Latin letters.
    P22 used to have collections of these on their site years ago, but I don't see
    them any more.  Maybe if we have some Japanese participants here, like Akira,
    they might be able to help ID these?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
