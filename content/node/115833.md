body: "Hi. I'm working on a webdesign for dj school.\r\n\r\nWe are going to use FUTURA
  PL as the main font for headers, titles and menu. The client doesn't want to use
  a serif as a complement for body text.\r\n\r\nWhich sans-serif font do you recommend
  to use for body text that would look good in combination with FUTURA PL?\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to avoid using Helvetica as the combination.\r\n\r\nHere is a draft with
  FUTURA and Helvetica\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Captura-de-pantalla-2014-04-17-a-la(s)-15_6414.40.03.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"
