body: I wanted to use CSS to style some text with Copperplate Gothic Bold and Harrington
  fonts. But I&#39;m concerned that they may be not found on many computers. <BR>  Is
  there a way to telling how common those fonts are? <BR>  If they are not commonly
  found on the typical user&#39;s computer, are there substitute fonts that are commonly
  found? <BR> <BR>                                   Thanks, CMA

  body: You are better off making a gif image of the type. If I remember correctly,
    Copperplate Gothic is only found on something like 20% of computers and Harrington
    is much less. Using gifs will ensure that everyone sees the words correctly. If
    you keep the original photoshop file, it shouldn&#39;t be terribly difficult to
    update.  <BR>That is, if you&#39;re planning on using those typefaces for heads
    and stuff.  <BR>If you want to use them for body text... well... just don&#39;t.

  body: I already have a gif. I want text. So I would appreciate suggestions from
    the knowledgeable for the best substitutes for Copperplate Gothic Bold and Harrington
    among the widely distributed fonts.

  body: Problem is, those <i>are</i> widely distributed, compared to anything that
    would look like Copperplate Gothic and Harrington. Web fonts are the only fonts,
    in my opinion, that one can count on. <BR> <BR>Considering how distinct those
    fonts are, can you really risk the user not having them? The design would be appear
    completely different. You could always toss some alt text tags on the images if
    you&#39;re concerned about searches and readers for the visually impaired.

  body: I second that you should look at SIFR. <BR> <BR>It substitutes your css styled
    html text with flash using javascript.  It is accessable and searchable. I&#39;m
    testing it now and will soon be using it on my websites. It is not great for long
    texts, as it can be a little slow &#40;depending on the users computer&#41;, but
    it is a fantastic alternative to using an image. <BR> <BR>Ed

  body: Ed, thanks for the suggestion. But I need to go with a very simple solution.
    I am replacing my logo, which is gif with alt tags, with CSS-styled text &#40;just
    two words.&#41; <BR> <BR>I will have to use Times New Roman, unless anyone has
    a recommendation for common fonts that are a bit closer to at least Copperplate
    Gothic Bold, if not Harrington.  <BR> <BR>  The current gif log uses Copperplate
    Gothic Bold for the first word and Harrington for the second word.

  body: A sans-serif font like Arial or Verdana is closer to Copperplate Gothic than
    Times.
