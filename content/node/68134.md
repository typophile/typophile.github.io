  this font.  I need to find it to update our logos at work, and unfortunately, the
  designer's files for our business were lost in Katrina.  Please check it out and
  see if you can help me- \"Modula Tall\" or \"Modula round\" are as close as I've
  been able to get, but it are not exact.\r\n\r\nThanks a mil!\r\n\r\nElizabeth\r\n\r\nPS
  if you cannot see the attached image, please go to www.vintage429.com and look at
  our main logo- that is the font I need to find.  Thanks!"
