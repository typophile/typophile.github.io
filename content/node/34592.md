  body: "One that is close is one I found in an old future-techno font printout from
    years ago called Mirth. I can't seem to find any info on it anywhere, and no longer
    have the font.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking and add any other finds to this post.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mirth_6512.gif]\r\n\r\n...found
    another called Gia, but can't find any info for it either. I have a feeling they
    might be from Japanese sites I used to visit in my addict days.\r\n\r\nAnother
    with a similar feel if you removed some weight is Hemi-head 426 by Ray Larabie"
