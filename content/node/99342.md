  Museum on a recent visit. The top image shows the not-quite-type: a metal stamp
  used by devotees of Vishnu to print on their clothing and bodies during religious
  rituals. The bottom image shows the printed result. I really like the adaptation
  of the letterforms to the medium.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BengaliStamp_4331.jpg]"
