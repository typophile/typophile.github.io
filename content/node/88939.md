  I have looked everywhere and still no luck. I know that details such as lines within
  the font can be created afterwards.\r\n\r\nPlease note specimens 2 \"PARIS\" and
  3 \"SAVON\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thedieline.com/blog/2010/11/18/vintage-packaging-french-lables.html\r\n\r\nThank
  you!!!!! "

    closer inspection, you are quite right about the fonts appearing to be hand drawn
    and/or engraved.\r\n\r\nAgain, THANK YOU!"
