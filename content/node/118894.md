body: "Looking for the font used in this logo (it was designed before I started working
  with the client), it's very close to Adobe Jenson, but it's not 100% there... seems
  like the lowercase e in Jenson has a more pronounced and protruding crossbar. Any
  ideas?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://seedbed.com/wp-content/themes/reseedbed/images/logo.png\">"
