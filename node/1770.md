  posted some type samples on the site : <a href="http://www.buildingletters.org"
  target="_blank">http://www.buildingletters.org</a> <BR> <BR>One thing which I think
  you&#39;ll all be interested in is the magazine which Max Kisman has put together
  for us. It has articles about African Alphabets and a great piece on the Highfield
  Art Club. <BR> <BR>Start the buzz, it will help us sell copies and raise the cash
  to build the orphanages which the project is all about.'
