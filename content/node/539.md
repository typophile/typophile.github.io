  body: Graphology is useless pseudoscientific cack claiming to tell us something
    about a person&#39;s innermost drives based on their handwriting. It is an insult
    to both science and art. I beg you, please do not waste any of your time on it.
    <BR> <BR>There is an organization that offers training in graphology claiming
    it can be a lucrative expert-witness gig in court. This is also cack. There are
    true Questioned Document Examiners who can detect &#40;using conventional scientific
    means&#41; whether two samples of writing were produced by the same hand, but
    their training is completely different from &#34;graphology&#34; and they regularly
    distance themselves from graphologists. But those not familiar with this conflict
    are easily led to confuse the two groups. Questioned Document Examination is a
    worthwhile career to pursue &#40;although about as livable as type design&#41;
    whereas graphology is not. Know the difference. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.abfde.org/fde.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.abfde.org/fde.htm</a> <BR> <BR>Graphology belongs in
    the same bucket as New Age religions, UFO and conspiracy theorists, homeopathic
    medicine and magnetic insoles. <BR>

    want to work.

  body: "I'm fascinated by the fact that I haven't read anything about people trying
    to do analysis on other people's calligraphy, in the same way that they analyze
    handwriting. This has me very perplexed because in calligraphy, we can often tell
    who wrote what, even if we are all scribing in the same style of writing.\r\n\r\nI'm
    still at a state where I'm not completely sold on what I have read, and I haven't
    applied what I've learned to my work. Still, I find this subject to be really
    interesting.\r\n\r\nI've noticed reading extensively on it, that I tend to agree
    with the graphology experts who have extensive psychology backgrounds and apply
    it to the analysis they do. I feel the more modern approaches to Graphology make
    a lot more sense because they realize that a lot of people think the subject is
    perceived as a irrelevant or inaccurate.\r\n\r\nLila"

  body: "I agree, that writing in more traditional hands can be less individual because
    we are striving to write in a certain way. However, when a calligrapher is just
    writing in their own style using a broad edge or pointed pen, doesn't it have
    the potential to reveal a lot about them?\r\n\r\nDoes it really matter if they
    are writing with a crayon versus writing with a ballpoint pen?"

  body: "The thing is calligraphy instruction is much more formal and imitative than
    the teaching of handwriting (at least these days). For example, our oldest does
    innovative things with some of his letters and his teachers don't complain (luckily),
    but when I took a calligraphy class there was essentially only one way to make
    a letter.\r\n\r\n> Does it really matter if they are writing with\r\n> a crayon
    versus writing with a ballpoint pen?\r\n\r\nI would say the more complex a tool
    the more potential for revelation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
