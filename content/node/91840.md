    extrapolate this out.  Havent decided what height to put the bowls of the bdpq.
    \ Both options appear in this proof. And guess where I got the e from?"

  body: chose the upper limit for the bowls. stretched the g vertically a bit, thickened
    the stem of the i a bit.  should the k reflect the e and now the changes to the

  body: "Thinking though the glyphs have so far very much grown organically from the
    original g, they do not quite mix with it, as a significant (probably) important

    put up a rectangle across the glyphs of a matching height to what the g already
    had.  I had it suspended across the whole set at first, but that was too extreme,
    so I opted to keep it only over half of a  glyph.  Or maybe not at at, such as
    in 'a' and 'o.' Or a third as in 'm'.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think about the 'n'?
    I think i may remove the cross cut there as it makes the glyph look, rather like
    a small cap 'B' actually. Or perhaps an 'R'. Actually i think i will refer to
    this glyph as is when I get to the 'R.'"
