  with access to the shop knows how to use it, and it hasn't been used in years.\r\n\r\nI
  know something about letterpress printing from reading books about printing, but
  I still think it'd be a really, really good idea to read in more detail about how
  to use the machines. I'm looking for recommendations of books about how to use a
  letterpress."

    mind you hanging out to watch. I think you'd learn more from experience rather
    than books. ;^)\r\n\r\n( Moving this thread to General Discussions. )"

  body: I found three rather detailed manuals on letterpress printing, including Maravelas's
    and many of those listed at http://www.fiveroses.org/intro.htm#Manuals, in a library.
    I'll look for an active letterpress shop too.

    that. I managed to find someone to show me around just to the extent that I wasn't
    afraid of breaking anything, and then I figured out a lot from more books in the
    library.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Book Arts looks interesting; I'll try to go to
    take a class there at some point, but it is less convenient for me to get there
    now as I'm fortunately no longer in Scarsdale.\r\n\r\nHere's the last thing I
