  body: I like it.  I especially like the use of contrast in the lowercase letters.  One
    thing that strikes me as a little off is the capital R; the bowl stroke begins
    to thin as it comes down and around but is then eclipsed by the heavier leg stroke;
    I'd like to see those two strokes harmonized a bit more.  But on the whole it's
    quite attractive.  Nice work.

    not quite right\r\nI was trying to base it on my R when I do it calligraphically\r\nI'll
    post a scan when I get home am at work at the moment"

    curve of capital O.\r\n\r\nWhile otherwise well-formed, capital S is a little
    bit heavy."

  body: "Good work!\r\nIMVHO, the spacing is not right at all. l are too tight, the
    spacing of e & i is unbalanced, they are too much to the right.\r\nIn terms of
    design: the g does not really fit; why did you do all these ink-gaps? what size
    do you want this printed? are you sure the ink gaps are consistent? there seems
    to be a u/n issue with the u too wide, no? the sa couple does not work, no?\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I am self-teaching myself type design so I may be wrong, I am simply trying
    to contibute to the debate & hopefully be told I am wrong & why so that I can
    improve."

  body: "Thank you to Cerulean and dojr2 its great to have feedback. \r\nThe idea
    for erato was to see how I could make a roman \r\ntypeface with a cursive structure.
    \r\n\r\nIn the lowercase n, h, m, etc the junction is as low as possible \r\nless
    so in the characters with bowls. \r\nAfter I did this it seemed to need an ink
    trap so the join\r\nwouldn't look so dark.\r\nThe spacing has been done very roughly
    and there are no \r\nkerning pairs.\r\nAnd dojr2 you are spot on the g doesn't
    flow enough but i don't want a one story\r\ng so I will try and get this form
    to work. \r\n\r\nThanks again for the comments"

    groups of letters somehow. less cursiveness (or sharp curves) for the former or
    more for the latter. \r\n\r\ni like the overall concept."

    in the Typophile critique forum is the best gauge of the worth of a font project
    :)  If you're looking for more feedback, your best bet may be to ask some specific
    questions.\r\n\r\nI wonder about the middle arm of your capital E and F (especially
    F).  Have you tried making this arm shorter?"
