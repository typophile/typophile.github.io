    may be correct, that originally someone drew this up as a logo and it may not
    be from a font.\r\n\r\nIf you are now in that same process there are a few that
    may help you capture the \"feeling.\" Among them would be Saginaw (Treacyface)
    to capture the \"V\" -- \r\n\r\nFontella - for the same \"feel\" (not the same,
    but similar) or even a Gilliess Gothic Sans\r\n\r\nWhat ever it was, it looked
    like it was influenced by Kaufman (Swing) Script.\r\n\r\nHope that helps in some
    way...\r\n\r\n"
