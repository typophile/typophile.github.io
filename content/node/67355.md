  body: "OK. Thanks.\r\nBut I don't think it's custom made, but thats just what i
    think.\r\nIt might be done with some print machine or what so ever and never been
    release for computers but I also might be so wrong.\r\nDo you know anything similar?
    Other than what you already linked\u2026[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Babylove_3740.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/RSC_5823.jpg]"

  body: "Those other photos make a good case that this exists as some sort of 'font',
    although they may be iron-on letters, and nothing digital.\r\n\r\nI searched Dafont
    and MyFonts.com and could not find anything especially close. (I did not look
    at the Blackletter fonts in my Script Guide, so I will do that now.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yeah, It really could be some iron-on letters. Maby Letraset might have something
    close enough?\r\nBut if i don't remember wrong I have seen that font used in some
    new t-shirts also.\r\n\r\nBut thanks a lot Mike.\r\n\r\n-ABCDEFG"

  body: "These were fabric, iron-on letters which the t-shirt shop would layout and
    press on for you. I'm sure they were fairly common at the time in the US.\r\nYou
    need to be looking for a simple, blackletter style that would have been around
    in the early '80s. Quite likely something you could also have bought as vinyl
    stickers in a hardware store. A lot of Jeff Levine's fonts are from this kind
    of source material but he doesn't seem to have done this particular one yet. Probably
    his closest are:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/same-old-english/|Same
    Old English]]\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/leathercrafter/|Leathercrafter]]\r\n\r\nI've
    never actually checked, but I always thought it looked like a very simplified
    version of Old English, with the fine lines removed and any breaks in the thicker
    strokes filled in.\r\n\r\nSimilar fabric lettering which in closer to Old English
    here in the basketball scene from \"Wildstyle\".\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aP0gFs8ObA]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    from the same movie ... check out Grandmaster Flash's back 10 seconds in. I think
    this might be the same alphabet as the Rock Steady Crew ones you posted.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qefZczEMmjI]]"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/graphic2url_5056.jpg]\r\nWell after lots
    of searching and not being able to find it, I decided to make it. \r\nIt's very
    basic with a few alt characters and limited punctuation etc. But it's enough to
    reproduce shirt designs or knock out a headline. \r\n\r\nAvailable here [[http://www.bengoetting.com/fonts]]"
