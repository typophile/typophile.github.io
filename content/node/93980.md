  all over the 'net\u2014here's one link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/ardenwood.font\r\n\r\nI
  think this is outstanding. The trouble is, one can't use it as it is\u2014the letters
  are all lowercase, and all those ornaments crash into each other.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd
  love is a completed version of this font. (Most of the glyphs besides the lowercase
  letters are blank.) Does anybody know who designed it, and if there is indeed a
  completed version available?"

    Scriptorium Fonts. Their website is at http://www.fontcraft.com/fontcraft/ . I''m
    going to give them a call and see what''s up with this typeface. Their website
    is a little gaudy but they specialize in revivals of real designs, so this is
    a promising lead.'

  body: "Nalle's DEMO fonts are intended ONLY to see what the font looks like. They're
    most often incomplete, have super-wide space glyphs,  have missing letters (usually
    a vowel or three), and are otherwise intentionally unusable. The full version
    of Ardenwood demo doesn't have these flaws.  However, it IS lower case only. The
    glyphs in the upper case haves the ruffles and flourishes, while those in the
    lower case are much plainer.  You can test the full font and look at all of its
    glyphs at the link provided by riccardo above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
