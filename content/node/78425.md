  to be the perfect fit for titles, but is too contrasty to work well for body text.
  \ Is there anything that would be a comparable substitute?  Is there a Bodoni designed
  for text that has less contrast & perfectly horizontal serifs?\r\n\r\nSorry if this
  has been discussed before, but a \"bodoni\" search pulls up just about everything
  under the sun.\r\n"

  body: Thanks for those.  I figured it must've been discussed.  ITC's SeventytTwo
    seems like "the one", though can't imagine it set smaller than 10pt.

  body: David, ITC Bodoni's three sizes have been optimized for display (72), main
    text (12) and notes or smaller text (6). So the one you're after - a less contrast
    typeface for body text - is Bodoni Twelve, not Seventy Two.
