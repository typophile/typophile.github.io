body: "Hi!\r\nI am wondering if anyone has heard a particular [old] saying about Caslon.
  I only remember the \"punch line\" and not the beginning of it.\r\n\r\nSomething
  along the lines of \"If you can't choose a typeface\", or \"If you are not sure
  what to set\"... \"If you don't know what typeface you should use\"and the punch
  line is \"...set Caslon\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone remember what the exact saying is?\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nFG"
