  for identifying fonts for me. \r\n\r\ni'm interested in expanding my knowledge of
  fonts. The way i discover \r\nfonts is very random. I'm sure i'm overlooking all
  kinds of great fonts.\r\nI tend to see fonts on various types of media on the internet,\r\nthen
  i come here to identify them, then buy it if i like it.\r\nThere must be a better
  way for me to discover fonts.\r\n\r\nIts difficult for me to find fonts through
  seemingly endless \r\narchives of fonts on sites like myfonts.\r\n\r\nAre there
  any resources that provide font lists that are combed through by \r\ntypographers
  and graphic designers or compilations of great fonts shown in context on print and
  web?\r\nThat way, i can look through content that i'm more likely to like and skip
  over the junk.\r\nI don't know if any resource like this exist, but i thought id
  ask.\r\n\r\nAlso, id love to have recommendations for books or other resources about
  the history of fonts. \r\nSomething that covers all the important font releases
  that were impactful in graphic design history. \r\nForgive me for not googling any
  of this, but i figured id get the best information by asking the community here.\r\n\r\nAny
  input would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    by Alexander Lawson\r\nTypes of Typefaces, by J. Ben Liebermann\r\n\r\nBut these
    deal in classic faces, and you may want something more contemporary or more oriented
    to display faces."

    one of them was:\r\n\r\nAn Atlas of Typeforms\r\n\r\nit was recently reprinted,
    but the reprint got remaindered, so it is easily available at reasonable prices."
