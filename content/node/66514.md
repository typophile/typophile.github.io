    letters are so varied. In addition to Tamas's suggestion, you could look at [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html|Part
    14 (Distressed Scripts) of the Script Font ID Guide]] for similar messy, blobby
    scripts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    project. I decided that if you need this kind of lettering it will be best if
    you draw it yourself.\r\nBest wishes."
