  larger scale image is attached.\r\nMy search for a constructivist  font drew a blank.

    free font by Roman Yershov, Jovanny Lemonad [2008] looks like a match.\r\nA comma
    \",\" is probably used to simulate the missing(?) apostrophe."

  body: "Many thanks Fivos. For a free font it works very well.\r\nUpdate:\r\nA well
    made Russian looking font that avoids silly features, like a reversed _R_ for
    _A_, and includes a correct Cyrillic alphabet that harmonizes well with the Latin
    letters.\r\nThis one goes in my favorites list.\r\nDon"
