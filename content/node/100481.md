    license is missing from the derivation.\r\n- The Dafont \"Donate to author\" button
    should not be there.\r\nBoth of those are EULA violations so unless Lonton corrects
    those oversights I would not recommend or use Frederic.\r\n\r\n* Same thing with
    DejaVu (while Prima is off-limits).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: hrant, my previous was only for you, thought stupidly you hadn't seen Vera/DejaVu/Prima
    were the same font. Was actually confused and misunderstood your sentence. Thought
    you were saying there was the same issue with Vera/Frederic and Vera/DejaVu/Prima.
    For the rest, I'm clueless for Frederic.

  body: Given its crude outlines and other discrepancies, I doubt Frederick was derived
    from Vera Sans. Even if it was, where in Vera Sans's EULA does it prohibit authors
    of derivative works from accepting voluntary donations?

  body: "1) Open source fonts typically require the original license to be reproduced
    (otherwise various things can go wrong).\r\n2) Very few fonts allow redistribution
    for money (Apache fonts, like Roboto, being the most common exception). Maybe
    donations are a gray area, but to me it's a pretty dark shade of gray when the
    \"Donate to author\" button is right next to the font download button...\r\n\r\nBTW,
    another reason to avoid Frederic is one of Lonton's other fonts, Josephin, which
    likely involves outline theft from a non-libre font, possibly Rotis.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "1) Absolutely, no dispute on that issue.\r\n2) \"Redistribution of money\"
    is pretty broad terminology\u2014 Vera Sans' license (as with most open source
    licenses) explicitly prohibits direct resale of derivative works, and that's as
    far as it goes; it explicitly permits resale as part of a larger package, and
    says nothing in terms of generally accepting donations for one's work (or the
    placement of \"Donate\" buttons in relation to download links). Many open source
    projects and authors accept donations and I've never had the sense that it's discouraged.\r\n\r\nBut
    in this case that's all rather moot; whatever Frederic's origin, it probably wasn't
    a libre font, and as you point out, Frederic's cousin Josephin is almost certainly
    a hack job of Avenir. Luckily it's only one letter as far as the OP is concerned,
    which could probably be modified from Verdana or borrowed from a similar font
    like Avant Garde."
