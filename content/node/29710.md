  I would very much to hear your opinions of the structure and the way the typefaces
  is presented etc. I\u2019ve cooperated with an MC (rap artist) and taken his lyrics
  as sample text when displaying the fonts.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you think
  I should add / take away to make it more attractive?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve just did a
  nice intro flash video aswell ;-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hear your comments,
  don\u2018t be soft on the critique if you have \u2013 I can take it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.autodidakt.se\r\n\r\n"

  body: Love your opening animation, which could be about 50% faster. It introduces
    people to the concept of creating digital type without being preachy. Maybe end
    it by filling the letter.

    idea. I think your right about the speed to, faster is probably better so one
    doesnt get bored."

  body: That animation is a terrific way to introduce the idea of "making type". You
    could even make a longer animation, just put it on a separate page or make it
    an optional link. If it was longer, you could show filling it, then adjusting
    it, then zooming out to show it in a line with other letters..... Maybe break
    it into wordless instructional modules that show the process of digital type design!

  body: Very nice. I agree that faster would be better. Maybe 3x faster. Particularly
    if it will be up for any longer period of time like a month or more. You could
    cut ahead to get a shorter movie. Just speeding it up maight look a bit frenetic
    and amaybe be unpleasant. If you fade from one clip to the next the impression
    of jumping ahead will be soft. Do you know what I mean?

  body: "Hi Goran,\r\n\r\nalthough I think this animation is really cool, I see some
    problems:\r\n\r\nI did not realise there was an animation at all until I read
    it in this discussion because I loaded the link in a new tab in the background
    and when I actually visited the page the animation had already finished. Is this
    ilkely to happen with other users or am I an exception? Is it possible to start
    the animation only when the page actually gets the focus (HTML \"on focus\" or
    so)?\r\n\r\nIs this really how you design fonts? Wow, I envy you ;) You obviously
    show \"corrections\" but they are very quick compared to the initial drawing of
    the outline from scratch. That is a bit misleading. To me, designing type is much
    more difficult and much more effort than that. Maybe this animation even devalues
    what you have to offer?\r\n\r\nIf this is supposed to reflect the design process
    some people might think you do not care about spacing and kerning, formal consistency
    within the family and so on."

  body: I had thoughts like Tim's but then I thought - to a designer it will probably
    just look really cool. And if he was to cut from one part of working on the design
    to the next the amount of time taken would be ambiguous...

    for a late answer but I have just been travelling a little bit. I understand what
    you mean, but I don\u2018t think it\u2019s a problem since most users probably
    visit the page directly. At least I believe so :) But if there is a way to make
    the animation start first when the user actually see the page, please tell me
    how to do it, cos I dont have a clue :)\r\n\r\n<cite>Is this really how you design
    fonts? Wow, I envy you ;) ...</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, of course not. Actually this animation
    is more to be looked at as a symbolic idea illustration, rather than an instruction
    movie or some kind of reality movie. An intro illustration, a decorative moving
    image if you like. More to give a feeling than to claim it\u2019s for \"real\".\r\n\r\n<cite>If
    this is supposed to reflect the design process some people might think you do

    nice little intro movie, nothing else. But of course I could be wrong.\r\n"
