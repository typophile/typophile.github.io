  elsewhere so I''ll ask it outright. My studio is working on a custom sans serif
  font for a client (lc, UC, #s and punct). We started with just the end product in
  mind but now the client wants to buy the font outright so no other usage or distribution
  will be permitted. I have NO idea where to start with pricing something like this
  out. Any advice would be great. _w'

    selling the font before current type trends are dead. Then think about how much
    of that money you\u2019re willing to lose in exchange for getting a lump sum now.
    And, of course, think about how deep the client\u2019s pockets are!"
