    by the entire resume, with a very impressive list of worked-on fonts!\r\n\r\n(Imagine
    browsing through any major font catalogue, with off-the-cuff remarks such as \"Oh
    sure, I did this one ... did <em>that</em> too ... and that one ... and I worked
    on that one ...\")"

    by the fact that I use this audience for proofreading (I did spell check it!),
    but if typos are all that is to be pointed out, I guess we have a fair chance
    to get this business going!\r\n"
