  body: Thanks, yet again, Mark. The letters are definitely Century. Here&#39;s the
    closest one, in terms of weight and width, that I could find online.  I&#39;m
    just not sure how &#34;fat&#34; the sample that was given to me got. I may need
    to be looking for a typeface with thicker thins that was based on Century. Maybe?
    What do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/26528.gif"

  body: 'The sample you have on your post #26 looks like ITC Century Bold &#40;possibly
    a knock-off&#41;. Century Schoolbook is a bit thicker in the thins. I also think
    the title has been condensed somewhat and some of the boldness is simply the result
    of video distortion &#40;blooming&#41; from being reversed.'

  body: Thanks Mark, My sample is ITC Century Standard Bold Condensed. I&#39;ve done
    some research into Century Schoolbook and haven&#39;t found a bold condensed version
    yet. I&#39;ll keep looking.  <BR> <BR>

  body: Just FYI, I found the typeface &#34;Century S True Condensed&#34; in my old
    Andresen &#40;Typographics, in L.A.&#41; catalog. It has fatter thins and square-ended
    serifs and is a good match to the logo. Unfortunately it is listed as an Andresen
    exclusive and the showing is printed in a coarse halftone to deter reproduction.
