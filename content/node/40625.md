    but the r has much more open space on both sides. Thus the middle has lighter
    'color' making the r and the word mark overall look weak. \r\n\r\nThe old mark
    solves the problem by using all caps and a square look. It's a bit dated, but
    at least it looks good and strong throughout. "

    come to copying (esp. by machines that go back and forth as they scan), that''s
