body: I am wondering who else on the forums is interested in the fonts from ephemera
  &amp; mechanical/modular sources - Receipts, LCD displays, Transit Systems signs
  &amp; tickets, Airport Flight displays, Baggage Stickers etc. Anything else? <BR>
  <BR><a href="http://www.lineto.com" target="_blank">http://www.lineto.com</a> seem
  pretty keen on this sort of thing. <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s playing Tempest, Galaxian
  &amp; Pac Man &amp; as a youth that has me smitten with this category. Obviously
  some of these fonts are pretty awful but some of them seem pretty peachy to me -
  if only because they do as well as they have in their confined set of options. To
  me that kind of success has it&#39;s own odd beauty.

  body: I think it&#39;s beautiful only when it comes naturally. <BR> <BR>For example
    the funky German license plate font to me is very natural, probably because it
    was made a non-designer. A &#34;designer&#34; would never have made something
    so non-selfconsciously functional. Beautiful. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The distinction you seem to have made seems false to me.  <BR> <BR>Even if
    you are working strictly within a grid you can innovate. There have been some
    really beautiful pixel fonts made in the last few years.  <BR> <BR>In a related
    vein - think of arabic tiles! Some of that work is magnificent even if it is really
    geometic &amp; mathematical. <BR> <BR>But back to pixel fonts - some of whats
    nice about pixel fonts for instance is how well they mimic something that looks
    hand drawn &#40;brushwork, or classic roman forms or woddtype forms&#41; but in
    some cases whats nice about them is how they work on their own pixely terms. Those
    are the interesting fonts for me. <BR> <BR>In these cases new interesting &amp;
    colorful forms evolve that result in part from the constraint or environment &#40;pixels&#41;.
    Rather than chafe on the pixels - the pixels are embraced. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not
    saying you would want to set a novel in these fonts - but that shouldn&#39;t be
    the only criteria for virtue.  <BR> <BR>What&#39;s nice about fonts from ephemera
    is their potential for evoking a feeling like any display face. They have a personality.
    Too much for a book of text. &amp; it may be somewhat industrially tinged personaility
    but that doesn&#39;t mean there can be no humanity coming through. <BR> <BR>You
    seem to be saying that typographic virtue can only flow from the hand. The logical
    extreme of which is that we should all be using fonts that mimic handwritting
    &#40; beautiful handwriting of course&#41;. You can really mean that.  <BR> <BR>On
    the other hand beauty is in the eye of beholder I suppose. <BR> <BR>What is this
    &#39;naturally&#39; you refer to anyway? What do you think of Base 9 &amp; Base12?

  body: '&#62; You seem to be saying that typographic virtue can only flow from the
    hand. <BR> <BR>? <BR>I believe in exactly the opposite! <BR> <BR>I love pixels
    &#40;I guess because they&#39;re still new&#41;, and I also think that embracing
    them &#40;and not just black pixels either&#41; is the key. <BR> <BR>Natural:
    Well, in the end everything is natural, I guess. But what I&#39;m talking about
    is something that flows more from the medium than the person creating it. A lot
    of design is made for other designers, not the user - to me that&#39;s &#34;unnatural&#34;.
    I like the Base stuff. One &#34;unnatural&#34; thing in it though is the overly
    narrow &#34;m&#34; in the 9: I know it&#39;s to fit the grid, but it could just
    have been like two &#34;n&#34;s - it seems that Licko was trying to make an ideological
    point - which is fine in an experimental face, but not one &#34;for the masses&#34;.
