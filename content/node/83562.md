body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/header_sept10a-1_6400.jpg]\r\n\r\nHi! New
  to the board, thanks for having me over!\r\n\r\nI created this header a while ago
  for my blog, but then changed computers and lost all of my fonts and psd files...
  I have found (via dafont) one of the two fonts (the <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/bomb-font.font?text=kense&psize=l\"
  target=\"_blank\">bomb font</a>) but can't for the life of me find the other, blocky
  one laid over it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"
