  FontLab, all weights have the same UPM size, very close values for descender, ascender,
  x-height and caps high. I tried to set bigger UPM size for UL weight, but when I
  open Illustrator, nothing changes. Also, I tried to increase size for UL at 115%
  but again, same result - nothing. This is what do I get:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5317.jpg]\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone tell me how do fix this? What seems to be problem, I can't remember anything
  logical to me.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
