  good swash and alternate functions. I've had a gander around at the usual foundry's
  and found a couple, but not nearly as many as i expected. I was wondering wether
  there might be a foundry or designer that specializes or dedicates to this style
  of typography?\r\n\r\nI've attached something from my travels that interest's me
  and is kinda what i'm after from MYFONTS.COM (Mon Amour Script Pro) but would be
  nice to find something not so commercial or exposed shall we say.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/24200_3754.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  help from you wonderful people would be muchly appreciated as always.\r\n\r\nWith
  Kind Regards\r\nLuey"

    on my next tattoo which will be all typography so being very picky with the choice
    of typography chosen.\r\n\r\nNeed to make sure I've left no stone unturned in
    exploring potential faces.\r\n\r\nThere must be so many more out there just gotta
    find them!\r\n\r\n"

    artist!

  body: "Doesn't necessarily need to be a font, I intend to only use the face as a
    structure and add my own embellishment and decoration. But I like the idea of
    using a word artist!\r\n\r\nLast tattoo i designed for myself was based on 15
    century renaissance penmanship so will be looking for a style to contrast this.\r\n\r\nSo
    when you say word artist you mean the people in the tattoo parlor or people that
    just do word art only?\r\n\r\nappreciate the input!"

    tattoos with some great lettering that the tattoo artist did himself/herself.

  body: At Linotype, we just released <a href="http://www.linotype.com/5866/libelle.html">Libelle</a>,
    a new design by Jovica Veljovic. I don't know if an 18th century copperplate script
    is the direction that you are looking for. But it would offer quite a contrast
    to a 15th century Renaissance hand! Also, the font has a number of alternates
    that you could play with.

  body: "OK cool Quin i'll check that out. The last two suggestions on faces are delightful!
    Dan i really think you hit it on the button with this Libelle! Indeed it would
    sit well next to 15th century Renaissance hand. Defiantly one i shall add to the
    short list.\r\n\r\nThis is going better than i thought. I'm still really interested
    to hear any ones else's thoughts or personal favorites off scripts they have or
    know off or indeed any good references of word art that you have come across?\r\n\r\nI
    have been planning this in my head for some time now, kinda itching now to get
    started with it!\r\n\r\nThanks Guys"

  body: "This was found on Flickr. Really Really like this and is the style i am trying
    to achieve with my design. My penmanship is some what non excitant shall we say.
    so it begs the question is there a font out there that has any resemblance to
    this at all?\r\n\r\nI know a lettering artist could have this done in no time,
    but i really want to have a crack at the whip myself first.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture10_6361.png]"
