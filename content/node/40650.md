body: "I'm doing layout for a client at their office, where they have a Windows terminal
  running Adobe apps & Quark 6. The laser prints of the newsletter I've been putting
  together look fine, but in trying to print a PDF of the 8-page Quark doc, I'm getting
  a document in which everything's in place except for one font, which doesn't print
  at all.\r\n\r\nNow, full disclosure: this is a font that I know perfectly well is
  expensive, and was surprised to find on their terminal (Neutraface - first version,
  all iterations [I think] ). It seems most likely to me that another part-timer left
  it behind as he whizzed through. So it won't surprise or disappoint me if I have
  to work around it (though boy, it does look snazzy). I don't understand Quark's
  behavior, though. \r\n\r\nQuark doesn't stop me to tell me that there's a conflicting
  permission bit, and it doesn't put another font in its place \u2013 it just leaves
  blank space. Is this how \"permission bits\" work - that you can use the font for
  quick in & out stuff, bathroom signs, no problem, but it won't spin down to your
  actual workflow?\r\n\r\nThe other reason I'm surprised is that I took the project
  home last weekend and worked on it on my Mac, and generated a PDF (to send to them)
  that looked fine. At home I'm running Adobe CS2, with Acrobat 8.1.1; at this office
  they're running CS3.\r\n\r\nSo if it sounds like I'm just trolling for an explanation
  of how font companies are starting to protect themselves, that's not coincidental."

  body: "Some foundries do manipulate the bits. AFAIK and I've worked plenty with
    House fonts, you can embed their fonts. I've done so myself. Their EULA allows
    it as well. (The new EULA more explicitly allows it.) \r\n\r\nHave you tried exporting
    from Quark as a .PS file and running that through Distiller? I know of a situation
    where I had to do that. But, it was a PS font so I'm not sure if the problem is
    the same."

  body: No, permission bits do not work that way - if the bit is not set, then you
    get an error message. This sounds more like a bug either in the font or in the
    PDF generating program. I have seen some wild things happening during PDF generation,
    so my guess would be the latter...

  body: "I'm glad to hear you both say so.As I say, none of the workarounds is painful
    \u2013 I can substitute another modern sans, or write the PDF at home \u2013 but
    I was wondering if this was how a restricted font was supposed to work (because
    if so, it seemed treacherous).\r\n\r\nThanks for your input."
