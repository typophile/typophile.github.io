  body: I don&#39;t know who letters Sin City, perhaps one of comic book aficiandos
    will chime in, but Dark Horse comics has used computer fonts before from <a href="http://www.comicbookfonts.com"
    target="_blank">Comicraft</a>. Even if Frank Miller does the lettering himself,
    I&#39;m sure you can find something very similar over at Comicraft in their lettering
    section. For less expensive comic book fonts, I&#39;d suggest <a href="http://www.blambot.com"
    target="_blank">Blambot</a>. I hope this helps.

  body: There is no credit for a letterer so I presume that Frank Miller lettered
    the stories as well as writing, layout and inking.
