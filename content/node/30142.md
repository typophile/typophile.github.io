body: "Has anyone had any problems with Quark 6.5 and Linotype's FontExplorer?  I'm
  having an issue where only part of a set of fonts becomes active in Quark.  The
  complete set is available in Illustrator and InDesign, but not Quark.  What's up
  with that?  And I'm using Quark because my client requires it, so I must figure
  this out.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

  body: "If your problem is with a OpenType font \u2014 that issue has been covered
    before (and in other forums as well). Here's the gist of it: older versions of
    Quark do not support OpenType-faces. Only the first 256 or so glyphs are recognized.
    Solution: update to QXP 7 or go the Adobe route (InDesign rocks!).\r\nPossible
    solution: do not use OTF but only PS (with Expert-sets)."

  body: The problem is occurring with both OT and PS fonts.  What happens is I get
    the Light and the Medium weights to show up, and not the Bold and Regular weights.  It
    doesn't make sense to me.

  body: "I guess you're problem is related to the way font families were merged and
    linked into one suitcase in the OS 9 days. \r\nTry this to hopefully solve the
    problem: find your original font files (with separate suitcase files for each
    variant) and use those. \r\nOr else use Font/DAMover (a Classic app!) to split
    up the faulty font suitcase(s) into separate suitcases for each subfamily.\r\n"

  body: Or it can be FontExplorer's problem. I stopped using it completely. Another
    pile of junk on the OSX font manager heap. IMO.
