  greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\"domain street\" is very similar to times new roman,
  but i think it's something else because of the capital R and lowercase a\r\n\r\n\"mills\"
  i'm pretty sure the all caps font is times as well, but i don't know what mills
  is.\r\n\r\nThanks again for helping!"

  body: "William, there are a couple of things that you should do in the future to
    make helping you easier: please don't post multiple requests in the same thread;
    and please use a .gif or .jpg image, instead of a pdf. The best thing would be
    if you could actually get the image to post directly, so we can see it on the
    top of the thread.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you can tell us anything about the origin and
    age of the sample, that can be helpful too.\r\n\r\nYour MILLS sample is hard to
    trust as to its accuracy, the image quality seems poor. It's hard to be sure (to
    me) that the caps letters are Times, because the serifs are sort of blurred. I
    would guess that 'mills' could be one of the Century types, since they have flat
    serifs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
