  font.\r\n\r\nThey are supposed to substitute a connecting letter with a nonconnecting
  letter whenever it is typed as a single letter.\r\nSo typing 'Banana' would result
  in a fully connected word. But typing 'B anana' would give you a nonconnecting 'B'
  followed by connecting letters 'anana'.\r\n\r\nI have been pulling my hair out trying
  to work out somethin with the opentype tags 'init', 'isol' and 'fina' but obviously
  something is wrong since it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nHeres a copy of the 'isol' tag\r\n\r\n----\r\nEDIT
  (something whent wrong in this post also :)\r\n\r\n   "

    but I don't think most Adobe programs do, if that's what you're using to test.
    \r\n\r\nIn addition to those features, you should probably add a \"calt\" feature,
    which the current InDesign does support. I've never done it, but I think the \"calt\"
    feature can be made to do this sort of thing. See the rather daunting \"calt\"
    definition in Adobe's <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?233@@.3bb7c828!enclosure=.3bb7c829\">example
    feature file</a> for Bickham script."

    'calt' feature.\r\n\r\nDamn! I might just be too lazy for that ;)\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the tip though"

  body: "Well I didn't have to write a very long feature file to get it to work. I
    guess you were right about the fact that indesign and other programs do not yet
    support isol init medi and fina. \r\n\r\nI got the thing working by making a calt
    feature looking like this:\r\n\r\n----\r\n  ###replaces the uppercase letter followed
    by punctuation or numeral with the isolated formof the uppercase letter.\r\n  sub
    @LETTERS_UC' @PUNCTU by @LETTERS_UC_ISOL;\r\n  sub @LETTERS_UC' @FIGURES_LINING
    by @LETTERS_UC_ISOL;\r\n  sub @LETTERS_UC' @FIGURES_OSF by @LETTERS_UC_ISOL;\r\n\r\n
    \ sub @LETTERS_LC' @PUNCTU by @LETTERS_LC_FINA;\r\n  sub @LETTERS_LC' @FIGURES_LINING
    by @LETTERS_LC_FINA;\r\n  sub @LETTERS_LC' @FIGURES_OSF by @LETTERS_LC_FINA;\r\n----
    \r\n\r\n\r\nThx man you saved my day"
