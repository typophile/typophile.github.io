body: "Hi, been a while since I posted. Came back for some help.\r\n\r\nI'm working
  on a logo and stationary for a bespoke furniture maker and he has the idea for the
  logo. It's based on some free font he found that mixes up the faces to look like
  some sort of ransom letter made up of different old display faces.\r\nI'm trying
  to re-work it using models of old types found on the manufacturers marks/plates/stamps
  foung on old furniture and antiques. If anyone could help out with images, leads,
  ideas or just a good source of unusual or archaic typrfaces that would be perfect.
  Much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers, James."
