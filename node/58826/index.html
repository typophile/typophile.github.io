  </header>
  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Alright guys and gals, let me start by introducing myself. My name is Graham Hammond (I creatively overlapped the two names to get my current handle). I was referred to this site by [[http://typophile.com/user/44690|Lefty]] and I&rsquo;ve moved here from Logopond. The constructive criticism over there is almost non-existent and since I&rsquo;m currently struggling with creating a brand identity for myself I was looking for opinions/tips from other great designers.</p>
<p>I am currently working on trying to create a personal logo for myself as a designer; something I&rsquo;ll use as a résumé header, website logo, and possibly on personal business cards. Right now, I&rsquo;m using a personal variant of the CS3 logo, as you can see. I am aware that this will not do, and so I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple months trying to create a memorable mark that I can use to identify myself.</p>
<p>I seem to be fine working on existing logos and providing good feedback for others and helping them to tweak their mark, but when it comes to my own I can&rsquo;t seem to get to the finish. I&rsquo;m extremely critical of myself and can&rsquo;t ever really be satisfied with something. I have gone through about 10 different ideas in the last month or so, and I just can&rsquo;t seem to make a decision. My brain just keeps coming up with other ideas and now I have an overflow of personal mark concepts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve narrowed it down to 5 of my concepts for this thread. They&rsquo;re not all the best ones, but they do encompass most of the base concepts I&rsquo;ve had&hellip; many other ideas are just variations of these. Let me make it clear that the main focus here is strictly the mark istelf, (I have to say it because people have focused on it before) the gradient background and the drop shadow are only for presentation; they have nothing to do with the mark! Also, focus is of course on creating a black mark first and foremost, as that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve come to learn it should be done. Color will come once the mark has been selected and perfected. Here&rsquo;s hoping you folks can help bring out the best in me.</p>
<p>So in somewhat of a chronological order, here we go:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh4_6558.png]</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it happened, but I really became a fan of negative space recently. I got inspired by some logos that I saw and I started to play around. This was my favorite for quite a while. I realize that a designer will probably see it right away, but I&rsquo;ve showed this to some people and they just see black shapes. I kind of liked the idea, it has a kind of Tetris block feel to it and takes a little bit to register the letters.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh5b_5407.png]</p>
<p>This one I like because it seems to invoke an image of a shift pattern generally seen on manual car gear knobs. I&rsquo;m a pretty big car buff, so this one sits well with me. Plus I think it has more significance as an insight into my persona. This one got comments over at Logopond to the tune of &lsquo;It looks too much like the LG logo&rsquo;. Personally, I don&rsquo;t see it&hellip; how about you?</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh6_4745.png]</p>
<p>This is one of my least favorites, but the idea popped into my head to modify the @ symbol. So I turned the &ldquo;a&rdquo; into a &ldquo;g&rdquo; and tweaked it to fit.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh7_5388.png]</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really remember where this concept came from, but it seems it may have developed from the @ variation. Obviously I added in the H and squared off the border.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh8_5360.png]</p>
<p>This is one of my most recent marks, and I hold this as one of my favorites. Again, there&rsquo;s something about negative space that I just like to play with. I felt it had just the right mix of simplicity, creative flair, and a bit of that &ldquo;a-ha!&rdquo; factor when you finally see it. However, I&rsquo;ve showed this one to many people&hellip; my parents, and a couple friends who also do design, and nobody seems to see the G in negative space until I point it out to them. I suppose this is the one I&rsquo;m looking for feedback on the most, as I just want a nice broad opinion on whether or not the G is noticeable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The second one is pretty solid, though as you stated the style is slightly derivative (I did NOT think LG immediately, however) and you may get pigeonholed. I think that last one could work but only if you could figure a way to make the &ldquo;G&rdquo; slightly more obvious. I have no thoughts on how to do that at the moment, though someone else may. As it stands right now that inside shape of the &ldquo;G&rdquo; stands out to me as being way too awkward with the very vertical and horizontal lines of the upper-case &ldquo;H.&rdquo;</div>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think of LG instantly, but I can see why someone might. The similarity for me is that both use a monoline, geometric typeface.</p>
<p>Perhaps moving forward you could try a different typeface, as Chris says, something with more personality.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, everyone, for your opinions. I see that the general input is split between the &lsquo;gearshift&rsquo; and the &lsquo;negative G&rsquo; options. This is more progress than I have made so far, so this is fantastic.</p>
<p>For the &lsquo;gearshift&rsquo; option&hellip; my original concept was the single stroke as presented in the first post, but the one I submitted and got the feedback on over at logopond was reversed on a circle. Maybe presenting it like this makes the LG connection more prevalent and thus why I got the comments I did:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh5_5741.png]</p>
<p>I still think it&rsquo;s plenty different and unique enough to work, but of course I&rsquo;m open to any and all input.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad to see that people like my &lsquo;negative G&rsquo; logo. I realize it&rsquo;s a bit challenging to see at first, but that&rsquo;s why I like it. I feel like that&rsquo;s what makes it successful; that you finally see it, and have that &ldquo;a-ha moment&rdquo; and you remember it from then on&hellip; it sticks with you. I&rsquo;ve run through a bunch of other variations, and since there is a lean towards that logo as well I&rsquo;ll post them here. It seems the basic suggestion is to tweak it more and try different typfaces. I had already experimented with that and kept going back to the original, but up for opinions now&hellip; here are all the variants I worked with:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh8all_3902.png]</p>
<p>Sorry about the scrolling, and I know I lack letters or numbers for each item like most people&hellip; but bear with me. I started originally with Helvetica and branched out to other typefaces and ideas. So here we go&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Ed, I&rsquo;m still very partial to that one, I just don&rsquo;t think it would be as successful for me as a graphic designer as it would if I were to go into an automotive business. This is the only reason I hesitate on it. I feel that the enthusiast inspiration would be lost on most people.</p>
<p>Reinis, perhaps you didn&rsquo;t read my initial post&hellip; but allow me to reiterate that the gradients and drop shadows are strictly for presentation. They have nothing to do with the mark itself. These were pre-canned images that I had already made up for use at logopond—where I didn&rsquo;t get as much help as I&rsquo;ve already had here. Also, thanks for the mock-up. The misalignment bothers me a bit as well and it was something I had intended to deal with should I choose to develop that mark further.</p>
<p>Alex, I also feel like the Eurostile G has potential. Maybe I&rsquo;ll work with it a bit more&hellip; thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I too like the gear shift version. I like the mark for it&rsquo;s metaphoric symbolism - moving forward, speeding ahead, someone who doesn&rsquo;t get stuck in ruts, pushing beyond the limits - concepts which may describe you as a graphic designer. That you are a car enthusiast is just an added dimension to the meaning. Glad to hear the shadows aren&rsquo;t part of the mark. And to be honest they don&rsquo;t bring anything to the presentation.</div>
