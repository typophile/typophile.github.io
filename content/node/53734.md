body: "I'm using Linotype Didot (or an extremely similar custom face) for an identity
  system and I'm contemplating over whether or not to use a sans serif for body copy
  (for collateral pieces, etc). I'm going for high end/modern simplicity. Do you all
  have any recommendations? I have come to the conclusion that using another serif
  face would be overkill, but I am open to suggestions. \r\n\r\nI thank you for your
  assistance in advance!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The usual suspect following the internal structure of a didone type would
    be Helvetica. But this is not the best type for body copy.\r\nYou could try Walbaum
    however, also didone, comfortable to read with a rather large x-height."
