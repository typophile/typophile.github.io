  I think it's a kind of Garamond, but the j's are too different. Does anyone recognize
  this font?\r\n\r\nIt's a scan from a Dutch translation of Dante's Divine Comedy,
  by Primavera Pers, Leiden,  published in three parts around 2000.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nMarcel"

  body: The "J" seems to match up with ITC Galliard. In fact, many of the roman letters
    do. But the Italic is a whole nother story... Perhaps the Dutch Foundry could
    be of some help to ID it if no one else chimes in. Sorry, I can't be more helpful.

    a similar italic, but not quite right, I think.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/garamont-amsterdam/\r\n"

  body: "I second Jan's comment.\r\n\r\nGaramont Amst is much too close to the monotype
    Garamond to be the culprit.\r\n\r\nBTW. I've always loved the monotype version
    (although not a real Garamond), especially the italics with all its quirks. I
    don't see around much anymore... pity."
