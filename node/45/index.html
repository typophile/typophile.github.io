		<div class="commentbody">Thanx! (Hrant approval is gooood <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">) <BR> <BR>Actually, the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height&hellip; So I guess I could make them cap height. Haven't tried. <BR>The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps&hellip; Hmmm. (Starting to notice a pattern maybe&hellip;) <BR> <BR>What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change, and if I took all in account, it would end up either like regular old-style or lining numerals. <BR> <BR>More questions: <BR> <BR>1. Being a newbie in (serious) type-design, I was wondering how many characters I should make, I don't really know how they all are supposed to look <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">  <BR>(I know the alphabet, of course, and the letters used in swedish, å,ä,ö, but I'm having trouble with things like the difference in lenght between en dashes and em dashes and various other characters) <BR>So, Is there any standard on how many (and what) characters there should be in a (professional) typeface. <BR> <BR>2. Distribution. <BR>I was thinking of making my bitmap faces (designed mainly for flash use&hellip;) available freely.  <BR>Is this a good/bad idea?  <BR>I invest quite alot of time in the tiny bitmapped stuff, but it feels like taking money for the typefaces wouldn't work. <BR>  <BR>Planned for this typeface for example is an extensive set of characters, small caps, different numeral sets and italics&hellip;oh yeah, and bitmap ornaments! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use? Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? Help me out here, please!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height <BR> <BR>! <BR>They look so much smaller&hellip; Maybe the tall &quot;Z&quot; next to the short zero exagerates the difference. OK, just ignore what I said.  :-/ <BR> <BR>&gt; The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps. <BR> <BR>That makes sense, since the old-styles are x-height (this time I actually measured to make sure&hellip;), and you want smallcaps to be a bit larger. <BR> <BR>&gt; What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change <BR> <BR>I don't remember such suggestions&hellip; Anyway, here's the best on-line sample that I know of: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html">http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>I've become conviced that -overall- the Carter numerals (as I [personally] have now decided to call them) offer the best balance in most situations. <BR> <BR>In your case I would make the &quot;x-height&quot; of the Carter numerals one pixel smaller than what you currently have for your linings, and extend the traditional old-style choices* by two pixels. <BR> <BR>* Except maybe make the &quot;2&quot; ascend - possibly by one pixel only. <BR> <BR>&gt;  I was wondering how many characters I should make <BR> <BR>Start with ASCII-8 (for both platforms). <BR> <BR>&gt; I don't really know how they all are supposed to look <BR> <BR>That's of course a major thing in type design. And sometimes designers will agree quite closely on things, other times not at all. And some designers worry a lot about the quality of such &quot;extra&quot; characters, while others just slap them together. <BR> <BR>Obviously, the more you look at precedents (especially of course reputable ones), the better your results will be - as long as you don't *mimic* anybody - think things through yourself, and apply your conclusions. For example, the en/em issue raises all kinds of opposing opinions, so in that case it's better to simply look at what those characters are supposed to *do* in text, instead of copying some precedent. Another example: many people make the Florin upright, but I've heard that the authentic form is slanted; this type of thing obviously deals with cultural preferences, so it's much harder to get right, as it can't really be &quot;thought through&quot; as much. <BR> <BR>Then there's this: <BR><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm</a></A> <BR> <BR>&gt; taking money for the typefaces wouldn't work. <BR> <BR>For bitmap fonts it only works if you have a stellar reputation - like Matthew Bardram. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, consider doing this: <BR>Make outlines, and have two versions of the font: one bitmap-only, the other with both outlines and bitmaps. You give away the former, get people &quot;dependent&quot; on it, and sell the full version. <BR> <BR>&gt; Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use? <BR> <BR>There are various schemes like that, but I think they're generally not flexible enough, and tend to be more complicated than people like. <BR> <BR>Consider this instead: <BR><A HREF="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082</a></A> <BR> <BR>&gt; Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? <BR> <BR>Some of them are probably here listening, so wait and see. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanx again. What a resource you are Mr. Hrant!  <BR> <BR>You have good suggestions, And I'll try to incorporate them (if it looks &quot;correct&quot; that is)tonight. <BR> <BR>About this ASCII-8 character set, where might I find that? Uhm.. Sorry if that's a stupid question, again, bare with the newbie. <BR> <BR>This typeface is (unfortanly) designed *only* as a bitmap&hellip; So I don't know what difference it would make providing them only with the bitmap&hellip; Anyway, I think I'm going the donationware route, or maybe honourware. I don't know. I guess I'll have to wait and see.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm fond of your small cap set. It's nice and  <BR>tight&ndash;the biggest requirement of bitmaps. <BR> <BR>Your new Ws are much nicer than the first round.

I took a needed vacation, and I saw what you were seeing when I came back. <BR> <BR>As for the distribution, I think it would be a financial hassle, as I would have to pay taxes, and probably register a company and so.  <BR>If I do not find a foundry that wants it, I'm releasing it as some sort of share/freeware. <BR> <BR>Thanx.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. Would it be nice to have a &quot;Classified Ads&quot; section in Typophile? People could offer their fonts for licensing - it could even become an alternative to submitting to a font house: font houses would come here to see what's for &quot;sale&quot;. <BR> <BR>Or maybe make it a subsection of the Critique forum: finished faces could get an announcement there, citing the intentions of the designer. I think the News section wouldn't really work for this type of thing. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
