  (including good photographic coverage of A-Z if possible) concerning the following
  inscription in or around the Worms cathedral:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/282096361\r\n\r\nIf
  anybody could oblige, if he/she ever visits LA, I promise to take\r\nhim/her to
  see some choice Hispanic lettering or something. And lunch.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't know when I'll be in Worms again, but I can say this about the images
    you linked to (since I took them in the first place ;-)  )\r\n\r\nThe grave markers
    are in the floor of the cathedral's western apse, that's the smaller apse down
    on ground level at the back end of the church.\r\n\r\nWhoever looks at the markers
    should mark their dates (not visible in my old photos :-(   ), but also remember
    that the dates of said persons' deaths do not necessarily equal the date that
    the grave markers were made. Bodies get moved a lot, especially those of important
    people."

    any info about the grave markers in them.\r\n\r\nI also only live about an hour's
    train ride away from Worms, and I tend to go their once or twice a year. I'm not
    planning to go again until at least the Christmas holidays, but if anyone is going
    to undertake a research expedition, I'd be glad to meet you there, depending on
    my schedule."

    You can't just walk onto its floor. The western apse is where its at."
