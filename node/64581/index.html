The alphabet is by its very nature dependent on and defined by conventions. Type design that is not bound by convention is like a private language: both lack the ability to communicate. Yet it is precisely the constraints of the alphabet which inspire many designers.

-- But I do like this typeface that I found to illustrate it --

An experimental typeface:
Miniscule by Thomas Huot-Marchand, a French postgraduate student of type-design who investigates the limits of legibility while physically reducing the basic forms of the alphabet. Minuscule is his project of size-specific typography.
Minuscule characteristics are large x-height, robust slab serifs, vertical stress, open structure, big counters, low contrast..

		<div class="commentbody">The term "experimental" seems to be a post facto pigeon hole description imposed by critics/historians/academics who don't have a more fitting slot to typecast the object in. If you are writing an academic paper, you need to qualify your research in a more specific manner. You may use your example above and focus on legibility issues. There is a huge dataset published on that alone. If you are doing something more arty and less rigorous, you might look at types beginning to break the mould of the status quo at the time. Herbert Bayer's Univversal or Van Doesburg's work might be an area that is fruitful from the early modernist period.--The unicase attempts of Bradbury Thompson and others as well. Even the 1980s ITC excess of x-height period is a more specific instance. There is always the overexamined Grunge period and the Carsonogenic excesses that followed him.

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly the term "experimental" is one of the most abused in the field of type. But Miniscule is a great choice, because it shows that something that seems too experimental can actually work great. And I think this is because it originates from the mind not of a posturing artist, but an old-school scientist, the great Emile Javal.

		<div class="commentbody">All typefaces, except the most unimaginative rip-offs and revivals, are experimental, because the type design process is one of "let's see if this glyph shape works with the other ones". So the designer experiments with applying variations of thematic qualities  like stress, contrast, weight, spacing, serifs, and curve shapes to individual glyphs, and seeing how they look--first in the metrics window, then in sample documents in various media. Next step is to go back and refine things to work better en masse. It's the feedback loop that's a part of so much creative production.

But I think what is loosely meant by experimental design is that which is unusual enough to draw attention to itself, rather than being part of a seamless whole where only the message is apparent, not the means by which it is delivered.

Recently "experimental" has been updated (rebranded? obselesced?) in the concept of Critical Design, so perhaps you could approach your topic by looking to see how a typeface could be an example of critical design, which carries more intellectual clout.</div>

Yes, and that's why the term shouldn't be used that way! It's best used when the design is deployed to some extent and then <em>tested</em>, somehow (not necessarily in some laboratory), using readers. Not just glared at by the designer (and his buddies).

I think it’s also become a term with pedantic connotations. I see the same ideas rehashed over and over and labeled experimental. They’re usually images from workshops or school projects. Sculptural letters, found letters, Sagmeisteresque letters made of string, counterless letters, modular letters, and code-generated letters are all commonly labeled experimental. But there’s a great deal of sameness to them; most of the variety comes from the raw materials or camera angles. It seems to me that experimental is often used in the same sense as school science lab experiments: the outcomes are predetermined and the purpose is hands-on education rather than innovation. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Experimental doesn't necessarily refer to the aesthetic properties of it. It could be in reference to people doing new things with OpenType programming; it could be projects like what Letterror has done messing with font format technology; it could be free fonts that the priesthood of us designers look down on, where every letter is a pot leaf or a cat. You can interpret the notion of "experimental" a number of ways, but I would definitely agree with James P. -- keep away from the Keedy Sans interpretation of what "experimental" means.</div>
