  has lower case with the same height/size as upper case.\r\ndo you know any good
  fonts like that?\r\nis there a special name for fonts with that feature?\r\n\r\ni
  need it for a logo of a group that uses a strange short cut like FuBaSa but i want
  all letters in the same height like its FUBASA.\r\ni have a graphic that will be
  on the top. that graphic has a flat bottom like a straight line and the space that
  appears between that line and the lower case makes me saaaaaaaaad.\r\n\r\nthank
  you for any tips!"

  body: <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-kLWtw8">"Unicase"</a> will be a useful search
    term. Although in most unicase fonts the "case" is determined by the shape of
    the letter (those with extenders are given uppercase form, the others, lowercase).
    It sounds like you want the /u/ and /a/ to be lowercase form and the /F/B/S/ to
    be uppercase?

  body: "1 Use Small caps and lower case - they are usually designed to do exactly
    what you want - and may only need some small fractional adjustment in size and
    or weight to look right.\r\n2 If the above is not possible - and it depends on
    whether you have already chosen the font or had it chosen for you ... A thought
    occurs - in teaching typography years ago - I used to get all my students - to
    understand the importance of x-height by getting them to work out conversion factors
    across a wide variety of professional fonts so that in a piece of running text
    they could set paragraphs utilising a wide range of types but ensure that all
    the x-heights matched even if from word to word if the font was changed from what
    would have been large appearing typefaces to small appearing typefaces eg Helvetica
    to Park Avenue. I used to arbitrarily take times new roman 10pt as the base index
    and run a sheet of xxxxxxx\u2019s each one with the name of the font and adjust
    the type size until I got an exact match to the times new roman x-height and then
    record the size required for the visual match.\r\nIf I had your problem I might
    try two weights of the font the lighter one for the lowercase and character by
    character apply a similar conversion factor to the typesize so that the lowercase
    was enlarged to match the caps.\r\nLove little problems like this that show off
    the brilliance of continuous digital adjustment ... and suggest new standards
    yet to be set - like measurement by actual appearing x-height - the most meaningful
    measure for the reader & lets do it in q (quarter of millimetre typographic points).
    Have fun ..."
