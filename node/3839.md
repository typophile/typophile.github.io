body: ' ok. so i have made some pixelfonts in my days.  <BR>but i still need to know
  one thing. <BR>mac can use bitmap fonts without the vector curves. but can windows
  do the same? <BR>so far, i believe not, but i&#39;m a mac person. <BR>i need to
  listen to a pc expert. <BR>this time around, i didn&#39;t bother to make the curves,
  only the pixels. &#40;and it works just fine in mac&#41; <BR>and now people now
  want me to make a pc version. <BR>is it really necessary to make the curves, or
  is there a way around this problem? <BR>maybe i ought to make curves anyway to make
  it flash compatible, but that is another discussion. <BR>-martin &#40;core&#41; '
