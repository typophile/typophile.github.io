  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,
As part of a project I&rsquo;ve been asked to set a series of essays; two of these are on Modernism. However, each essay has to be set in a different face that echoes (or re-inforces) the topic it is speaking on. I wonder if anyone would be able to make any suggestions, as I&rsquo;m having quite a difficult time selecting suitable faces!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Long Live Modernism!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Massimo Vignelli 
currently set in Gill Sans, which is an issue - Italian-American author set in an English face, not too great a choice on my behalf. This is the one I&rsquo;m having major issues setting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New World View<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jan Tschichold taken from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
currently set in Univers. I&rsquo;m pretty settled on the setting for this one, as I feel Univers reflects the content and authorship of the essay.</p>
<p>Any suggestions / critiques of my choices would be very helpful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>I initially set the Tschichold essay in Sabon, but then discovered on further reading that &lsquo;A New World View&rsquo; was taken from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where he argues against serifs and for asymmetrical typography (including sans serif faces). Sabon was designed after he decided the views expressed in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were a little too radical and that serifs weren&rsquo;t so bad after all. (All the Penguin books are set in a serif, as per his detailed instructions).
So not sure whether that reflects the content as strongly. I guess ideally it would be set in the same face as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The New Typography<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but I don&rsquo;t have it to hand to check what it&rsquo;s set in! It would be quite ironic to find it set in a serif&hellip;</p>
<p>Will try helvetica and futura for the Vignelli - at the moment I&rsquo;m thinking about Hevetica Neue as Vignelli is arguing for a revival/continuation of Modernist thought and a re-worked version of a Modernist face would be quite apt for this. Although so would Futura&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t realise this would be so tricky&hellip;! Thanks again.</p>

<p>I love Massimo&rsquo;s work. He uses a typeface as a neutral tool and makes the page come to life with his use of space, alignment, and tension.  The typeface does not do the work, Massimo does.  To that end, Helvetica is a good choice (though I much prefer Univers). 
Massimo&rsquo;s work would still be the same had he replaced Helvetica with either Univers or AG. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that it would have been better.  I am just trying to say that he chose a small set of tools and used them to their fullest.  That was just his way of working.  I would much rather have a Vignelli piece (all done in Helvetica) hanging on my wall than any lesser designers work with all of my favorite type faces used.
Massimo is a Helluva' master (and he mastered Helvetica to boot).</p>

<p>Actually, it is not his problem, it is exactly his solution.</p>
<p>Imagine &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; was a builder in the 1950s and only had a few hand tools to work with but he was able to make sturdy, yet beautiful buildings anyway.  Jack did good work because he was a master builder, not because he had a full range of tools. Let&rsquo;s say that we give someone of mediocre skill and talent (call him &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;) a complete set of the finest power building tools our modern era can produce and have him build a house.  Would you rather have the house that Bob built or the house that Jack built?</p>

<p>Thank you, and same here.
But do know that -just like you- I&rsquo;m not alone in my opinion:</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the second sentence of a synopsis I just got from Oak Knoll for a new book entitled &ldquo;Book Typography&rdquo; starts: &ldquo;It examines the essential factors of a well designed book - attractive and suitable type, &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not alone in thinking that type is the first thing a good designer worries about.</p>

<p>So his great achievement is making Helvetica look better? Is the role of a designer to redeem fonts? Or is it to make things that express and serve.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to admit critique of sacred cows one admires, but sometimes those cows happen to be sporting quite massive blinders. For me at least, great technique doesn&rsquo;t overcome using inadequate tools.</p>

I never thought you would be the only one with your opinion&ndash;only that you would be the most vocal in expressing it :-)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;For me at least, great technique doesn’t overcome using inadequate tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great Pyramids, the Parthenon, the Trajan Column, and the Stradivarius Violin were all created with inferior tools yet great technique prevailed.  Matisse, during the latter years of his life, was crippled to the point that he could only barely use crude scissors yet managed great works of art using his inadequate tools and less adequate hands. With all the computer driven knowledge and high-tech laser tools available today, there has never been a violin created to rival the 17th Century Italian masters.</p>
<p>I much prefer greater-than-adequate skill and talent to the greatest set of tools imaginable.</p>
<p>If someone were to give me the most amazing surgical tools on Earth to use, I am sure you would not be willing to have me perform surgery on you.  The result would surely be Grotesque (pun intended :-)</p>

<p>Why do you say that? Is there any reason to believe they didn&rsquo;t use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->best available<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tools? That&rsquo;s my point. I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t blame Vignelli if he only had Helvetica and Bodoni available to him. His pyramids are made of reed.</p>

<p>They used whatever tools they felt comfortable using, so did Vignelli. His pyramids are made of talent.
You choose to attribute much more to tools than I feel tools merit. I prefer to attribute the majority of any success to the skill and talent of the human doing the work.  A resourceful person can make do with whatever tools he chooses. A person of mediocre skills can&rsquo;t do Jack with the best tools ever invented.  There has never been a violin to rival Stradivari&rsquo;s. Modern man has far better tools than Stradivari ever had but not the talent to equal his.</p>
<p>I would be very curious to see some of your typography just to be able to see what you consider good work.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.
But that doesn&rsquo;t mean Vignelli&rsquo;s skills at using a couple of fonts can make moot his ignorance of the full spectrum of the expressive and technical dimensions of type.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I suck at typography. But anyway that&rsquo;s beside the point.
The simple truth you keep avoiding in this argument is:</p>
<h1 id="human-expressions-are-more-than-a-few">FONTS EXPRESS THINGS
+
HUMAN EXPRESSIONS ARE MORE THAN A FEW</h1>
<p>A FEW FONTS ARE NOT ENOUGH</p>
<p>This is why Vignelli is limited; an artist uninterested
in the potential in type, just the potential in himself.</p>
