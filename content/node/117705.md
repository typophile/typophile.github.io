  body: I suspect it is a scan or vector of a decorative initial from an Italian manuscript
    from the 17th or 18th century, paired with an engraved script for "lori."

    medieval times to the present, but didn't see anything like your sample.\r\n\r\nGlad
    you found a music-specific source that will move you in the right direction. Happy
