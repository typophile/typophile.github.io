  body: Seems like Neutra Text, with the '1' used for an 'i'. In that case it's scaled
    up as well, as the Neutra Text numerals are medieval. Also possible that this
    is a variant with proper lining numerals.

  body: Neutraface is right but you need to go with [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface
    Display Titling]] and not Neutraface Text.
