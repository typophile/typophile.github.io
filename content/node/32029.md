  History</cite> 49 (Volume 25, No. 1). It is a nice write up on the several revivals
  of a font family from Binny & Ronaldson, America's first (successful) type foundry.
  Also some of the story about C. H. Griffith's and P. J. Conkwright's collaboration
  of bringing out Linotype Monticello, and the latest revival by Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I recently got my hands on the article, and am almost finished reading it,
    but had a question that I couldn't wait to ask: on page 18 there's mention of
    a face used by John Bell called \"English Roman\", and it sounds fascinating.
    But I wonder if this is this the Bell typeface that we know, or something else?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'English is a type size equivalent to 14pt, so ''English Roman'' implies something
    very generic: a roman type at 14pt. Presumably, in this case, it was Bell''s own
    roman type.'

  body: "The label itself did sound mundane to me as well, but the article: uses the
    label in a way that seems to imply something special, I mean beyond just a generic
    size term; and it says that \"many of the letters had two alternative forms\"
    which I don't remember being the case for Bell's face (except for the famous \"k\").\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Carter, et al for giving Monticello to us again. This is the type that started
    me thinking about letters when I was about 14, many years ago. When I saw the
    Linotype version I knew I was seeing something different than what I had been
    reading before. The face \"spoke\" to something in me, something beyond the voracious
    reader I was then. It opened my eyes so I could begin to see what words and lines
    were made of. & here I am today. & to this day I find it an admirable type.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Hrant:\r\n\r\nI really cannot recall just what it was that made me stop and
    LOOK at Monticello. I was not at 14 altogether ignorant of type, but nearly so.
    I had been given a cheap toy cylinder press when I was about 7, and I used its
    cheesy rubber type through junior high school, printing billheads for my \"Newark
    Evening News\" paper route. & I used to pore over my aunt's Heritage Club books,
    paying special attention to the little folders she kept with them, fascinated
    by colophonic nuggets about typefaces, printers, and papers. & I had been in enough
    printing shops to have been captivated by the siren sounds of Linotypes and printing
    presses. Those were my favorite industrial places.\r\n\r\nBut this Monticello
    face stopped me dead. I guess by that time about a dozen volumes of Jefferson's
    papers had been printed, and I encountered the face in one of them, as I read
    for a history project. Perhaps it was the design of the Princeton volumes, more
    sedate than those in Heritage Club books, that also attracted me. Or better presswork
    than was common in books a bookish boy might read back then. Who knows? Those
    days are long ago and misty. I know that I saw something good. I recall the sensation
    as strongly as I recall the first Duane Eddy records. & the first Ornette Coleman
    records a few years later.\r\n\r\n& Monticello seems to have pre-figured something
    of my taste in type. As soon as I became an apprentice compositor I discovered
    Bell and Baskerville, and, when given a bit of rein to make type choices I gravitated
    in those directions. Bulmer, too, attracted me, but a bit less. Scotch Roman never
    caught my eye until M Carter's Miller, which is now nearly my \"house type.\"\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe it is in the blood. My mother's family came to these shores early, from
    Scotland, and indeed settled near to where Jefferson made his home at Monticello.
    When I first went to college that was in Scotland County.\r\n\r\n& I do think
    of myself as a rather down-to-earth guy. I started this reply Friday afternoon,
    but the weather was so good I left work early to work in my garden: a rather Jeffersonian
    pursuit.\r\n\r\nThat's all I know about it.\r\n\r\npowers"
