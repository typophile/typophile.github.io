body: I&#39;m building a product showcase with Flash that is translated into multiple
  languages. The translations are handled with Text files. e.g., we send the files
  to Poland, and all the dealer needs to do is open up a text file, translate the
  text and voila, they have a Polish version of the showcase. Easy-peasy.  <BR> <BR>The
  problem we&#39;re running into is that the showcase uses our corporate font &#40;Frutiger&#41;.
  We embed the font&#39;s outlines in the Flash file, but when someone needs language-specific
  characters, some of the content comes up missing. If we switch the font to Verdana
  &#40;or any basic system font&#41;, most everything seems to show up &#40;from the
  small amount of testing we&#39;ve done&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Now my question, is it possible
  to embed an OpenType version of Frutiger and expect it work in multiple languages?
  Is there a better way to support multiple languages?

  body: Not knowing much about Flash, an obvious question is, &#34;Does an embedded
    version Verdana &#40;with the real Verdana removed from the machine&#41; display
    correcty?&#34; <BR> <BR>If so the problem would most likely be with Frutiger.
    Maybe use Font Validator to see if all the codepage and Unicode range bits are
    set correctly, or if the font has other errors.  <BR> <BR>If the embedded Verdana
    fails then the problem is likley with Flash itself - either in it&#39;s Unicode
    support or in it&#39;s subsetting of the font &#40;removing the Polish characters&#41;.
