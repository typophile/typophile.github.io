<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>i am trying to find something typographic (other than a CD of typefaces) that i can buy/steal/make/acquire for my graphic designer girlfriend for the holidays this year - any ideas? i have already been through the Veer catalog, as well as some of the foundries, and a T-shirt is not really what i am looking for. something unique, beautiful, and made of or insipred by typography. It does not neccesarily need to be super cheap - id like to get her something nice. jewlery? handmade typographic clock? i am at a loss here.
any thoughts?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would move ahead with the "typographic clock". Find out her top 12 faces, and assign one to each hour (ransom note style). Or make all the digits in the same one. Or no digits at all -- assign letters and reinvent her concept of time. I'm sure she'll be into meeting you for a date at L:RC o'clock. Plus, making it yourself beats anything you'll find for sale at veer (sorry veer).
The best typographic gift I recieved was the "CTS Photo display catalog" (a phone book sized type specimen collection). Not the most obscure collection, but for graphic designers, seeing a face in print helps with type choice far better than screen previews. Plus, there's a perverse collection of swashes and unseemly ligatures.</div>

These guys have some nice letterpressed posters and notecards:

http://www.sternandfaye.com/gnj_Garden.html
Also, since I'm in Nashville, I would like to mention Hatch Show Print, which has been around since the late 1800's. They have a wide range of posters and reprints which are great because most of them are printed with antique wood type.

<div class=commentbody>eBay, under <strong>Business and Industrial > Printing and Graphic Arts > Graphic Arts Essentials</strong> has LOTS of letterpress cuts and woodtype up for auction at ANY given time. There's something charming and captivating about these "artifacts," and they can make quite attractive decor as well. Of course, going the auction route is always hit or miss -- someone else may REALLY want that item that has caught your fancy but, as often as not, some real gems gets overlooked and can be had at a VERY reasonable price.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think any graphic designer would definitely love the entire <a href=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/articles/greatideas/><em>Great Ideas</em></a> set from Penguin. Loverly typographic covers adorn some inspiring—if not downright revolutionary—texts from smarty-pants know-it-alls like Nietzsche, Woolf, Freud, Orwell, Marx and others.
Michel de Montaign's essay <em>On Friendship</em> is so moving I almost cried... in a laundromat. IN A LAUNDROMAT.
You, my friend, will be a romantic hero when this gift is opened, and I want royalties on all the love you get.
Ha.

<div class=commentbody>There was a lecture at TypeCon this year where the presenter described Gill's life using his personal letters and writings. Lets just say that Gill made me ill and no father should do anything like that to their daughter. That is the first lecture I have ever walked out on and it had nothing to do with the man giving the presentation.

<div class=commentbody>I know what's in the book because: I've previously read virtually everything he's written in (or had translated into) English; and I've discussed his view extensively with many others for a while now. In fact his ideas are pretty obvious once you think about them (although it takes an eloquent expert like GN to put it into clear words). What's not obvious is the "dark side".
BTW, a lot of what GN says I agree with - in fact some of the things he says make me want to hug him! But it's certainly ironic that I agree with the things he says in proportion to their distance from type.

<div class=commentbody>Re. Gill. Yes, a badly broken man in many, mostly sexual, respects. My friend Alan Wall described Gill's attitude as 'priapic adventurism', which I think is a fair assessment. To be fair to Gill, his diaries do indicate remorse over what he did to his daughters, and they for their part seem to have forgiven him and not ceased to love him. [One of Gill's grandaughters, Petra's daughter, lives in Vancouver, by the way, and sent me a very nice catalogue of the paintings, drawings and engravings that David Jones had done for her mother.]
I was disappointed in the article to which Chris linked, since the author seems intent on using Gill's pedophilia and Penty's socialism -- which he clearly thinks on par morally -- to dismiss the distributist movement. In fact, neither Gill nor Penty were 'founders' of the distributism, as the article claims, and the economic philosophy was formulated in England by Chesterton and Belloc and based on Leo XIII's encyclical <em>Rerum Novarum</em> and other Catholic social justice teachings of the 19th and 20th century. What Gill and others tried to do was apply this philosophy in the particular context of rural communal life: a kind of Catholic back-to-the-land movement. The philosophy of distributism, particularly its dual critique of both capitalism and socialism, shouldn't be dismissed because of the moral failings of one of its advocates. [Also, as someone who has recently moved to a rural community and is giving a lot of thought to the differences between life here and in Vancouver, I think the critique of industrial urbanisation in, for instance, Fr Vincent McNabb's <em>The Church and the Land</em> has a lot of merit.]</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I think you might find very little to rebut in <em>The Stroke.</em> While some of what Noordzij wrote in the occasional pieces that comprise <em>Letterletter</em> may be taken as a kind of chirographic design advocacy -- although I'm not convinced that it is intended as such --, in <em>The Stroke</em> he is explicit in stating that what he is outlining is a way of analysing and describing what one is looking at in writing. There is almost nothing in the book about type design or typography: it is really presenting a new methodology for palaeography and other studies of specifically written forms that focuses on deciphering how strokes were made during writing rather than on the classification of the resulting letterforms. There is an adaptive functionality available to type designers from this methodology, that <em>can</em> be utilised to aid judgements that affect, specifically, uniformity or harmony of structure <em>as it contributes to the overall style of a typeface</em>. That is, it is a methodology that assists in aesthetic decision making, and is not intended or promoted as something that overrides or undermines other methodologies, whether focused on the aesthetic or functional aspects of type. Noordzij doesn't even go this far -- this is my own formulation of what I find useful to my work in his analysis --; as I say, he barely mentions type at all.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, I do need to read the thing.
But you seem to again be invoking the "GN doesn't prescribe, he describes" escape clause, which I don't buy: he makes fonts in a certain way, and he has encouraged others to do likewise via the classroom. Of course, it's only natural for somebody to teach what he believes; but I hope it's also natural for people to look beyond the charisma and intelligence and see the anti-typographic emotions fueling the whole operation.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>You were talking about a rebuttal, specifically, to <em>The Stroke,</em> and this is what I think you will find, when you read it, a misplaced notion, because <em>The Stroke</em> is not a book about type design or typography. It is a much more narrow piece of work than <em>Letterletter,</em> which covers a broader application of Noordzij's theory. I think there is stuff in the latter to which your critique applies, but I think you will not find it so in <em>The Stroke.</em> It is a much less polemical work than <em>Letterletter</em> -- excepting when he briefly gets onto the subject of how reading and writing are taught in schools --, and basically consists of an analysis of a number of different stroke patterns <em>in writing</em> to determine how they are made and how to describe them. It is a book about looking at written forms.
Because Noordzij's books have been published by typography and design oriented publishers (Hartley & Marks, Hyphen) and he has taught in a type design programme, I think we are tempted, as a community, to presume that we are Noordzij's audience and that he is telling us something about how we should do what we do. But what strikes me about parts of <em>Letterletter</em> and basically all of <em>The Stroke</em> is that he directly addresses palaeographers and students of writing systems. If you drop the presumption that he is talking to type designers, and read the books as a critique of assumptions and methodologies in the study of the history of writing, I think you get a truer picture of Noordzij's engagement.</div>
