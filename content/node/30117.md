  body: "Well, yes.  Sort of.  I actually agree with letting users dictate the size
    they want to read the page at: the last thing I want to visit is a web site that
    wants to lock me into one (their!) view which may or may not make me want to stick
    around.  \r\n\r\nSure, that means some complications when designing a site, but
    they are not dissimilar considerations to producing print documents.\r\n\r\nAnother
    problem I have with your link is that it's four years old -- we've come a fair
    way since then technically...."

  body: Meh... I'm a big fan of just designing a web page to scale well with the type,
    and not worrying about the details. It beats banging my head on the wall while
    I'm trying to figure out how to keep things working in IE/Firefox/etc.

    \ But now there's Firefox and upgrades to Safari, and a swack of other minor browsers.
    \ And I won't even go into what you need to do to make sites useful for the visually
    impaired.\r\n\r\n<em>But spec\u2019ing sizes is still the same code, isn\u2019t
    it?</em>\r\n\r\nType size hasn't changed much but monitor sizes have.  It's quite
    unusual now to spec for small monitors, whereas that used to be much more standard.
    \ Part of that's because the prices have come down, at least here in the industrialized
    world.\r\n\r\nI dug out one of my early web design books -- it's pretty funny
    the way it talks about HTML 2.0 as \"cutting edge\" -- and when one considers
    the explosion of XML et al, I'd want to see this site updated within the last
    six months to be really useful. \r\n\r\nPlus it's not just designers who have
    made great strides -- users are a lot more savvy (and discriminating) about what
    they will and will not deal with.  Even with many folks switching from dial-up
    to some flavour of high-speed, monster Flash-only sites still have a limited audience:
    personally, I usually skip 'em....\r\n"

  body: An new issue for page layout is that IE7 zooms all elements rather than just
    increasing text size. And it's easier to do than before.

  body: "\"Having our text look consistent across browsers/OS is a good thing, no?\"\r\n\r\nIt's
    a futile thing.\r\n\r\nThe web is not about dictating design, but suggesting design.
    Suggest something, and assume it will change to an extent by the time it's rendered
    for the end-user.\r\n\r\n\"Type size hasn\u2019t changed much but monitor sizes
    have.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, but while they've gotten larger, they've also gotten smaller
    (PDAs, Cell phones, Blackberries, compact laptops, etc.)"

    Disgusting. I want everything locked down tight, especially the text. \r\n\r\nNow,
    that doesn't mean that I want everything to only be one size, because accesibility
    is important. But I want everything to scale in proportion to MY design. Not to
    a browser's indiosyncratic whim."

    It's your suggestion of a design. The browser, the monitor, the user, the display
    device, etc. all have a say in how your design will eventually look to each individual
    person.\r\n\r\nDon't try to dictate to the pixel online. It will only drive you
    crazy."

  body: "I don't want to dictate the pixel. I want to dictate with an Iron Fist the
    structure. I see far too many piss-poor webpages that treat type as if it were
    a second thought, because quite frankly it is to most people. If I dictate structure
    with the end browser and user in mind, and the design <cite>of the text</cite>
    comes out properly, then I have done my job.\r\n\r\nEmbracing the medium does
    not have to include throwing out all of our knowledge of how people read and what
    makes for best readability. That means structuring everything to scale properly
    according to best usage. Good structure and design transcends all mediums.\r\n\r\nBut
    I'll argue that it IS my design, browser be-damned. It's the same as printing
    on a crappy 4-color offset newspaper press. You know something is going to get
    screwed up if you call for 12pt Bodoni in full color on both page 1 and 2 flats.
    The color is going to mis-register, everything will look like mud, etc. It's STILL
    my design, and I have to accept responsibility for ignoring the limitations of
    the medium, and adjusting accordingly.\r\n\r\nBrowsers are still in the crappy
    4-color offset press with bad rollers stage. We are all waiting for the Heidleburg
    browser to come out, but until it's here, we still have to have accountablility
    for our designs."

    can do that somehow * with defining the whole site css with the unit <em>em</em>
    instead of <em>px</em>. With <em>em</em> you can make a layout \"fix\", but enable
    the zoom functionality for the user via Browsermenu (fontsize), Wheelmouse, Shortcuts
    for ALL browsers.\r\n\r\nThe initial fontsize defines the \"largeness\" of the
    whole site. If the user decreases/increases the fontsize, the whole sitelayout
    is zooming. Like opera did that for years or IE 7 now (jumped on the bandwagon)\r\n\r\n*
    there is a javascript-experiment available, that reduces dynamically the line-height,
    if the user changes the font-size. It is a \"weak beginning\", but it is a beginning."

    sounding like a typical frustrated print designer on the web. ;0)\r\n\r\nOn paper,
    yes, it is your design. It can only look one way. And you know it's going to look
    exactly the same for everyone that picks up that piece of paper.\r\n\r\nOnline,
    you simply do not know that. You don't know what fonts a person has installed.
    You don't know what size their web browser is. You don't know the size of their
    monitor. You don't know if they are using a wide screen plasma monitor or a 2\"
    cell phone screen. You don't know if they prefer 18pt type for their aging eyes
    or prefer 8pt type. \r\n\r\nYou simply can't dictate anything online. Only suggest.
    By all means, use your training and skills and knowledge to suggest the best option,
    but also realize that it might change, and design to accomodate that whenever
    you can.\r\n\r\n\"Browsers are still in the crappy 4-color offset press with bad
    rollers stage.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are equating 'I can't force this design
    on everyone' with meaning 'it's a crappy browser'. A good browser gives more control
    to the end-user than the designer.\r\n\r\nAnd while zooming sounds good, it's
    not necessarily better or worse than the usual font size zooming in other browsers.
    They both serve a purpose, but people may prefer one over the other.\r\n"
