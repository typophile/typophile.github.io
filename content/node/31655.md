  type as \"modern, mediterranean, fusion\". Anyone have any suggestions for fonts
  I might look at for inspiration? I have done some research already but nothing I've
  looked at so far seems appropriate. "

  body: "timd, that's nice, but I was thinking a bit more modern.\r\n\r\nStephen,
    the business is an internet cafe and they have chosen the unfortunate moniker
    of \"java junkies\". so I was hoping to class this up with a nice type treatment. "

  body: Try something totally different like Hurricane of Selfish. They are punk fonts
    but they might be a good mix for the caffine crowd.
