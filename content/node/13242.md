  without paying for it.\r\n\r\nNow before you grill me, I don't use fonts without
  license and I have no intention of starting. My firm cover the cost anyway but I
  need to test the font. I'm not sure I'm even going to use it, probably not. It's
  an expensive font and i'm running up to big a bill just to get a font and then decide
  it isn't quite right.\r\n\r\nIf I want to use the font, I will purchase the license.\r\n\r\nSo
  where can I get it? :)"

    I can promise no one here will send you a font but will probably give you a location
    you can test your font.

  body: "I agree with the other Dan and Hrant. E-mail the foundry and ask for an extensive
    setting. Or even for the font itself. Many, many foundries actually do* give out
    test fonts if you ask nicely and/or promise to delete the files within a certain
    period of time.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/foundry/fsd/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Yes,
    many <em>really do.</em> Even if it doesn't say so explicitly on their website.
    Have you ever asked?\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
