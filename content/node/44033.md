  body: The work shown was done by [[http://www.planetpropaganda.com/|Planet Propaganda]]
    of Madison, Wisconsin. Interestingly though, Dan and Michael who make up Minneapolis
    based Aesthetic Apparatus met while working together at Planet Propaganda. However,
    I'm not certain if that means that either of the AA guys worked on this project.
    I can ask a friend at Planet if you would like to know more...
