<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello Typophiles - <br>I am new to this board, so let me introduce myself before I ask for your help. I am attending college at Kansas State University in....Kansas (go figure). Graduation is scheduled for the fall of '05, although I am considering pursuing Graduate school. I am an avid mountain biker and soccer player. <br> <br>For the last few days I have been pondering about creating a logo to use for promoting and identifying myself. I work on a medium amount of freelance projects, and I thought it would be nice to have something to put on a business card when I am networking with people (i.e. drunken shmoozing) <br> <br>In the back of my head I would like to steer this towards being a pretty strong graphic symbol, that I could then apply variations to in the form of ornamentation/texture. The thing that really got this all started was a discussion about printers marks - <br>here is a link to some...<a href=http://www.lib.iastate.edu/art/printmk.html>printers marks</a>. I think I would like to base it around my intitials in some form, but you have any other suggestion let me know. Here is one that I have come up with, its rough....HAVE AT ME! <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28927.gif alt="Initial Mark"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello, Shawn, welcome to Typophile. <br> <br>What does this mark, which you've posted, mean to you? And do you feel it is saying that? I read nothing about design, but I can see communication.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess in some ways it represents the "flow of ideas" through a plane, that plane being things created in the physical world. I seem to have double posted...im such a rookie <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>So it is Friday and I've had too much Chinese food for lunch. can see what you see. <br> <br>As you are also into the outdoors I'll mention that it (sort of) strikes me as a petroglyphic mark. (Probably used the wrong word there too.) But, do you feel as if it is too simple? Or not simple enough? <br> <br>everyone double posts. it happens.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like it. Maybe because it's open to interpretation, but there's clearly some mutual movement (communication) going on. <br> <br>I might make it more compact though, and add some irragularity, like in that St Albans Mark - or like the Koch symbols: flares at the ends of strokes and somewhat "off" arrowheads, although it's not easy to make that look intentional and not like a mistake. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>- on your point tiffany i can see where you say that it doesnt correlate with design directly or even obviously. But to be honest I find that many time artists logos or designers logos are fairly obvious, i.e. a paintbrush. While I think that this is excellent if done well, many times it is not. I also tend to be more of an abstract thinker. So it fits my personality... <br> <br>- hrant, i agree with what you say about adding irregularity. I also think it is tough to make it seem intentional. I am going to try a variation with more of a "serifed" feel to it. By compact do you mean more of a even height and width? <br> <br>thanks for the suggestions guys.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The connotations of "up and down" are very strong and have a lot of baggage. People seeing the abstract motion of ideas are likely to vaguely think "there's a good one and a bad one." What if you rotate it?</div>
