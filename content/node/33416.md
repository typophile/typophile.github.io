    Baroque</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/flemish_script_regular_ot/">Flemish
    Script</a> which have much better letter connections.

  body: "Thanks - I figured this font would be fairly commonplace since it was offered
    through the invitation company (Caslon?) - but they called it PEN in their internal
    order sheets.\r\n\r\nI am planning to make mailing labels for the invitations
    so I was hoping to match the font as close as possible."
