body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI feel I should know this newish-looking oldstyle face,
  which I kind of like. Anyone?\r\n\r\nThe book is Erin Hogan's <em>Spiral Jetta:
  A Road Trip through the Land Art of the American West</em>, published by the University
  Of Chicago Press in 2008. It was probably designed by Jill Shimabukuro, who is mentioned
  as having done the jacket.\r\n\r\n(Sorry about the cropped textblock. I can post
  images with more text or more detail if needed.)\r\n"

  body: Pretty small sample. Judging by T, e and a, it could be some Garamond.

  body: "Thanks for you input, Riccardo! I added a much bigger image.\r\n\r\nYeah,
    I was going to call it \"Garamondish\". But I'm pretty sure it's none of the common
    Garamond revivals; look at the \"a\".\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That's it! Even the slightly unusual question mark as well as \u2013 though
    not seen in my sample \u2013 the numerals and the dollar sign, with a slightly
    slanted bar, seem to be the same. (Unfortunately, I have no access to a scanner
    now so I could post more samples.)\r\n\r\nThanks a million, Riccardo! I like the
    robust readability and sheer beauty of this face."
