  a script I have made, to make a totally different typeface based on the original,
  like here (comic sans):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%204.jpg\r\nhttp://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%205.jpg\r\nhttp://www.drgs.no/dreamless/Bilde%206.jpg\r\n\r\nSomething
  similar actually done by Umbrella TF:\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000144#specimen\r\n\r\nIs
  it legal and what license restrictions apply here?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: It is a gray area at best and to begin with it does depend upon the foundry
    from whom you've licensed the typeface. Have you licensed the typeface already?
    Can you tell us the foundry?

  body: "Usually, you are prohibited from taking a font you have licensed and using
    its outlines and other data to make another, whether that new creation is very
    similar or very distinct from the original. You can typically modify the outlines
    of the font in a program like Illustrator, but you usually cannot make a font
    out of your modifications. You can usually create a new font based on a previous
    design if the original is a printed specimen, i.e. not first created in digital
    form.\r\n\r\nI've emphasized that this is what I believe many <em>(not all)</em>
    [[EULA]]s require, but as Tiffany said, you should examine the license agreement
    of the foundry you are considering licensing the font from and e-mail or call
    them if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nAs for the recommendation, you should try
    searching Typophile first (I know I've seen a thread about rounded type recently)
    and then make a new post in General Discussions if you want more or more specific
    recommendations."

  body: I'll add that 99.9% if not 100% of foundries do not allow derivate work to
    be sold as a new and/or original font. From that, most foundries don't even allow
    modification. However, some foundries, such as Adobe, do allow you to modify their
    fonts and use them internally for other work.

  body: I see. But what if there's no certain way of telling what typeface that has
    been modified?=)

    this case...wrong.\r\nIf you are modifying a font or thinking about modifying
    a font, you MUST rely on the foundry's EULA. Legally that is the contract between
    the foundry or designer and the end user or potential modifier."
