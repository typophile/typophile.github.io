    glyph. A typical 320-glyph font usually includes approx. 200 non-composite glyphs,
    so the cost per font is US$1000\u20132000. "

  body: "Gus,\r\n\r\nAs far as suggestions on hinting, it might help to know more
    about what kind of typeface you're hinting, which formats you're delivering, and
    the level of quality you're after. If you want pixel-perfect rendering at 9ppem
    in Windows XP with font-smoothing turned off, you'll need some advanced TrueType
    hinting, and Adam's figure is probably in the ballpark (multiplied by however
    many weights in your family). But even without deep pockets or extensive technical
    knowledge, it's possible to improve rendering using some combination of autohinting
    and manual tweaking.\r\n\r\nAssuming you're hinting for TrueType (or both PostScript
    and TT) you can use PostScript hints as a jumping-off point. Adobe's autohinter
    can\u2014depending on the font style\u2014produce results that rival manual hinting,
    or at least get you part-way there (provided you're alignment zones and standard
    stems are accurately set). Then use the PS hints to generate TT instructions in
    FontLab, per Adam's tutorial: https://docs.google.com/View?id=dhnxc5bs_21ggxfqxft&pli=1\r\n\r\nFrom
    there you can go into hinting mode and make manual adjustments, fine-tune problematic
    glyphs, add delta hints, etc. While FontLab's visual hinting tools don't cover
    the entire set of possible TrueType instructions, it's easier to dive into than
    something like Microsoft's Visual TrueType, and the Windows version additionally
    shows previews in grayscale and ClearType (AFAIK Mac FontLab's hinting previews
    are black and white only).\r\n\r\nBeyond the section on TT hinting in the FL manual,
    I found the info and examples in Jigal van Hemert's \"Practical TrueType Hinting\"
    to be particularly educational:\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/tt_hinting_tutorial.pdf\r\n"

  body: 'Thanks Justin. I will do that. I have spent a great deal of time optically
    correcting previous fonts. I think I will be ok. I don''t really want to put the
    effort forth for pixel-perfect rendering at 9ppem in XP with font-smoothing off.
    The way I see it, that the viewer doesn''t care anyway. They are happy with Arial
    and probably use/abuse Comic Sans and Papyrus. Maybe I''m ignorant or maybe I
    just don''t have a full grasp on designing for the web yet. Don''t get me wrong,
    I want the font to be as amazing as possible and I take pride in my design. If
    I had the cash or to put into it I would. For now your helpful tips will have
    to tide me over. Thanks again. '

    having a long debate over the merit of ie6&7 compliance with a developer friend
    over a few beers. My attitude may have carried over into my prior response here.
    Wow, that makes me sound like a giant nerd. Anyway, thanks again for the links.
    I really appreciate it. No disrespect intended.\r\n"

  body: "Buy the book \"Learn Fontlab Fast\"\r\n\r\nWhat it will tell you to do is
    basically:\r\n\r\nDo everything in Type 1. Convert all contours to Type 1. Your
    contours should run the right directions.\r\n\r\nThen convert contours and instructions
    to Truetype.\r\n\r\nUse font audit and fix any errors.\r\n\r\nErase all your hinting.\r\n\r\nAuto
    hint everything.\r\n\r\nFix overlapping hints.\r\n\r\nThen look at it and write
    down which glyphs need more hinting work. You'll need to use truetype hinting
    on them, which is more precise than Type 1 hinting.\r\n\r\nRead the fontlab manual
    about truetype hinting. It's not that difficult to figure out how to do it, but
    it is a lot of tedious work. Truetype hinting will give you the best results,
    and you can preview your hinting at different sizes as you work.\r\n"
