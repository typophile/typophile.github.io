body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nrecently made the switch to 10.7 and noticed that the default
  File Info window (apple + i) in the Finder doesn't display the same amount of information
  for font files. Before (meaning pre 10.7)  you could quickly check copyright info,
  version number etc. \r\n\r\nAnything I am missing?\r\n\r\nTIA.\r\n\r\nSeb"
