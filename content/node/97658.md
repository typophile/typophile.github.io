  below). Sorry for the picture quality. I had poor lighting and it was a capture
  with my phone out of an article. \r\n\r\nIt's similar to the Consolas typeface,
  but has different notable features in the lowercase \"l\" and spacing between the
  legs of the lowercase \"m\".\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n"
