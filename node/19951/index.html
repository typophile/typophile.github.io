<p>I&rsquo;m fighting a battle at the moment! I&rsquo;ve designed some guidelines for a client in which the prevailing style is left-aligned, un-justified type.</p>
<p>The cleint&rsquo;s company have just been introduced to the new style and they are moaning about not being able to justify or centre-align text with the new guidelines!</p>
<p>Does anyone know of or have some concrete material that I can use to convince them that left-alignment is both more elegant and more legible than a centred or right-aligned column? Also interested in any benefits of un-justified type (although I know this is debatable!)</p>
<p>Something like a case-study would be ideal. Anything that concentrates on legibility benefits is really the key thing!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you ask me FL/RR vs justified is a matter of taste and also can depend on the usage. For narrow column measures justified type can be problematic because you end up with word spacing issues as  you sometimes see in newspapers or mags. Justified type is cleaner though and you don&rsquo;t have to deal with rag issues.</p>
<p>What is the job? And why are you resistant to justified type?</p>
<p>Centered type is fine for heads or for short bits of text like captions, callouts, or blurbs but can be very annoying to read in longer paragraphs.</p>
<p>Right aligned type can be effective for heads perhaps but not for running text.</p>
<p>Also with either centered or right aligned text it can be hard to distinguish paragraph breaks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One reason for not using centered or ragged right text is that it is harder to read. When the eye gets to the end of a line, it needs to travel back a distance (hopefully not too far) to get to the start of the next line. If that starting point is always at the same position on the x-axis, it speeds up reading. Ragged right and centered text mean the eye must return to that position, and then work across to where the text eventually starts.</p>
<p>Non-justified type, as has been mentioned, should not be a problem in good typesetting. But in word processed documents, where hyphenation programs may be suspect, and users often double space after a period, you can easily wind up with a space between words, or at the end of a sentence, that is much wider than the eye expects. When it hits this, it acts like a brick wall. The reader stops reading, wondering if something should be in this space, as it looks big enough to contain something. Eventually the eye starts up again, and continues, but the delay from bad spacing can be significant.</p>

But you can still pick up any gross features (like the left
boundary of a paragraph block) quite a distance into the
parafovea. Also, the parafovea is better than the fovea
at picking up movement. For example, to see the flicker
in an interlaced computer monitor, look <cite>away</cite> from it.</p>
<p>And do try this, the next time you have to drive out of a
blind alley: instead of flipping your head left and right
a dozen times and moving ahead in fits and starts, stare
straight ahead, drive forward slowly but steadily, with
one foot on the brake pedal, and watch for movement in
your parafovea to brake for.</p>

<p>You could quote what Bringhurst has to say, which I think is pretty sound.</p>
<p>With justification you have the problem of the variation in word spacing, which has to be addressed by the typesetter, using things like the &lsquo;paragraph composer&rsquo;, the H &amp; J slider, and his or her own judgment.</p>
<p>With ragged right you have the problem of producing a good rag, which as I believe some in the other thread pointed out is not so easy.</p>
<p>Bringhurst points out that the problems of word spacing become greater with shorter measures, so the argument for ragged right becomes stronger there. But note that newspapers, with narrow columns, still usually have justified type as the norm.</p>
<p>To have a balanced view of what works best when, I think it is important not to buy into ragged right as a modernist dogma, which it has been.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve been told before (and I&rsquo;ve certainly seen all those examples in typographic history books) Modernism actually professed left-aligned setting. But that was in the early years* (and more prominently applied to titles, not text) and possibly a reactionarism to the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; establishment for the sake of a reaction. It should be clear that Modernism&rsquo;s preference for Das Grid naturally leads to a preference for full justification, and that is what we see <cite>today</cite>, with Modernism&rsquo;s terminal evolution.</p>

For a long time now, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.
Modernists can be purists (all ragged), or mix rag with justified.
There&rsquo;s no reader impact one way or the other, except as has been pointed out, when you have long words poorly justified on a short measure. But even then, a spot of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; justification can enliven a dull slab of text.</p>

<p>Yup, Fontesque for titles, and Fontesque Text for, er, text.</p>
<hr>
<p>But seriously, where&rsquo;s the research that says rag or justified is better?
All you will find is opinion and counter-opinion.
It&rsquo;s a matter of preference and aptitude &ndash; if a client wants justified, they should hire a typographer who does good justified (aptitude, attitude, experience), and not M. Vignelli.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dunno. Where&rsquo;s the research that says jumping off a building is bad for you?</p>
<p>Humans make their decisions -especially important ones- based on thought and instinct. Instinct is extremely individual, but thought develops thanks to many things, including intellect, and communication with others, and certainly not only empirical findings (I&rsquo;m sure you agree). Some people have thought about some things more than others; and the thoughts that lead me to believe that rag-right (when properly done) is better are documented, and seem sound (in that I have yet to hear good counter-arguments).</p>
<p>I guess each of us simply has to decide who to trust.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose that I can just chime in here for the sake of contribution. I typically prefer justified texts or well balanced ragged lines, and for a current project, a short newsletter style publication, I chose to go with ragged right. This is something I have not done for a while, and I was reminded as to why. Even though I was writing all the content on my own, which gave me the freedom to edit words, line lengths, paragraphs, and what not to make the proper fit, I felt it was still just as difficult, if not harder to achieve a well balanced rag all the way down the page. Although, at this point, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how nicely the columns have come out, and how the publication looks overall. I set with Chapparal Pro for the body copy with variations of Frutiger for section headings and sub-heads. I also intermingled more artistic typography, pertinent to the content and overall design of various other bulky sans serifs.</div>

<p>No argument there.
It&rsquo;s just that when we sacrifice quality for the sake of
expediency, we should at least be aware we&rsquo;re doing so.</p>
