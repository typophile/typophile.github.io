body: Hi, I&#39;ve been designing a logo for sort a union of culture &amp; research...
  I really don&#39;t know how to explain it, as it&#39;s fuzzy already in Swedish.
  <BR> <BR>Oh well, I went the swash way &#40;don&#39;t kill me, they&#39;re supposed
  to symbolize the northern lights&#41;, and now I&#39;m stuck with the type... <BR>It&#39;s
  Gill sans bold for the &#34;Nordkalottens&#34; part and Adobe caslon semibold for
  the &#34;Kultur &amp; Forskningscentrum&#34;. I don&#39;t like the type... please
  help me <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1240.gif" ALT="logo">

    it&#39;s perfect.  <BR>It&#39;s seldom Gill feels original these days, but here
    it does. <BR> <BR>&#34;Kultur &amp; forskningscentrum&#34; should maybe be a in
    little smaller point size. And not so close to the logo symbol.  <BR> <BR>Skitfin!

  body: ' Hej, you crazy svenskas. <BR> <BR>I like it too, Richard. Very comforting.
    <BR>Maybe try all the text aligned left or <BR>almost aligned left with &#34;Nordkalottens&#34;  <BR>a
    bit to the right so the symbol fits in <BR>nice and snug. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: ' Yeah, I had it aligned left before, but it looked sort of weird when there
    was a huge gap between the symbol and the lower text. I&#39;ll try to move it
    a bit though. &#40;resizing it might do the trick as well though&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: ' I think it&#39;s pretty nice - the type seems to work well, especially if
    it&#39;s a &#34;sober&#34; operation. BTW, swooshes aren&#39;t so bad for non-internet
    stuff! <BR> <BR>But I see two potentially serious problems: <BR>1. It&#39;s really
    wide - so it&#39;s less versatile. <BR>2. With the green, those look like leaves,
    and not at all atmospheric effects. So it immediately makes me think of an environmantal
    conservation organization or something. I know blue is cold, but... <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    also this: Because your logo relies on tight spaces &#40;in this case the gap
    between the &#34;leaves&#34;&#41;, you should make a different version for smaller
    sizes. <BR> <BR>BTW, if they&#39;re serious about the aurora stuff, you might
    consider making a wide, shimmering, irregular curtain spanning the width of the
    lettering. Technically much more work for sure &#40;you&#39;d have to do some
    magic with negative spaces&#41;, and you&#39;d have to make sure it&#39;s not
    too &#34;literal&#34;, but it might turn out really nice. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Hmmm...  <BR>Yeah, I was going for sober. As for leafs... yeah, I&#39;ve
    heard more than one say it. This wasn&#39;t a commissioned design in the usual
    manner though, and the aurora theme wasn&#39;t in the brief.  <BR> <BR>The spacing
    between them gets wider for smaller logos, as I&#39;ve been down that road before.
    It&#39;s quite a simple shape though, and it stands up well in a fax. <BR> <BR>thanx
    anyway, looks like I&#39;ve got an ok for the type, feels nice. '

    n&auml;ringsliv&#39;s logotype as well. Might be the gradient. So I&#39;d skip
    the gradient, change green for purple and follow Hrant&#39;s advice on making
    it look more like norhtern lights. <BR> <BR>Adobe Caslon works real nice though!
    Great setting of it! '

    ALT="svensktnaringsliv"> <BR>On the other hand, the green has worried more than
    one person... Leafs stands for growth though, and this institution &#40;I guess,
    the brief was fuzzy&#41; stands for cultural growth and research...  <BR> <BR>Btw,
    I&#39;ve never recall seeing purple northern lights... seriously, I might be wrong,
    but most of the time it&#39;s green. <BR> <BR>As for the Caslon, I&#39;m quite
    satisfied, I shrunk it a bit and now it looks great.

    their brief was very fuzzy and I tried to make the best of it.. Basically what
    the above logo is &#40;if you look closely&#41;, almost the same swoosh I&#39;ve
    used, but rotated with a gradient. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m ok though, as I find my piece
    better, it&#39;s still going in my portfolio. &#40;as a suggested design or something...&#41; '
