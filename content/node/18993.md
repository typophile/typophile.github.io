  military hardware (<A HREF="http://membres.lycos.fr/voituresrares/mondial/photos/hautdegamme.htm">H1</A>'s,
  <A HREF="http://www.deltaforce.net/ferret/ferret8.html">Ferret Armored Cars</A>
  and the <A HREF="http://www.military.cz/usa/air/in_service/aircraft/angels/angels_en.htm">Blue
  Angels</A>) I'm excited about House Industries release <A HREF="http://www.houseind.com/">United</A>
  (I've been reposting House' teasers for the past few months). But I wonder how this
  will play out amongst your average designer and international audiences?

    something. Boot camp for designers! Better still a tour of duty (or two) in Basingstoke.\r\n\r\n>What

    they\u2019re but??!! \r\n\r\nWell, the design community may be able to come together
    with a series of posters promoting alien awareness or perhaps a signage system
    directing the aliens to \"our leaders\". Better still a coffee table book with
    some tastefully moody black and white alien pictures and series of essays from
    film makers and product designers. Well there goes next years April Fools... \r\n"

    one of me best memories was visiting the Red Arrows base as a child while in the
    Cub Scouts. However my daughter was born on Seattle's Seafair Sunday with the
    Angels overhead so I have a soft spot for them too.   \r\n\r\n> wow. 105 fonts!
    that\u2019s bordering on overkill!\r\n\r\nShock and awe!\r\n\r\n\r\n "
