  Express]], designed by Paul van der Laan, is the latest addition to the everexpanding
  Feisar family:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feisar-express-overzicht_6369.gif]\r\n\r\nFeisar
  Express could be called a \u2018retro-futuristic inline script typeface family\u2019.
  But it would be better to say that it is the outcome of an experiment to explore
  what can be done with current font technology. This family comes in two different
  inline styles (called One and Two) and each inline style comes in three different
  variants for up, down and alternating connections (called Uptown, Downtown and Crosstown).\r\n\r\nMore
  information, examples and a specimen can be found at the [[http://www.type-invaders.com/feisar-express/|Type
  Invaders website]]. A special introductory price of 50 euros for the complete bundle
  applies until 15 August.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPaul van der Laan\r\n[[http://www.type-invaders.com//|www.type-invaders.com]]\r\n"
