If you are "gonna do it" then look to the "pinched" terminals in the m, n, h, u, w, y  etc. And feel free to explore the 2 story "a" and the rounded T. Look at reference for the capital N...  Just a few suggestions. Victor Hammer spent a lifetime on these forms and GG Lange did a very nice "version" with Solemnis. I think it has real potential (subjective, of course) I would like to see more idiosyncracies.</div>

First of all, it is not meant to become any sort of historically faithful rendition of Uncial. V. Hammer, yes, but that hardly counts for me here.

On the opposite, I’m tempted to make it look techy, even quirksome.

Unicase is surely worth consideration. The majuscules too big – I think about it.

There might be an alternative set with some capitals more 'common'. There may be about six (?) weights at the end. Variants with higher ascenders.

And don’t ask me for Italics  :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great idea!

The critics are premature—if you develop this as a typeface, then the issues which they have raised will be resolved when you add weights, especially bold. As it is, this is the germ of an idea. A huge number of light weight sausage faces have been published, because they are so easy to make, and for this reason they don't amount to much (they are indeed lightweight).

I don't consider this at all modernist. The nearest would be if one imagined Rudolf Koch had done something similar.
Certainly DIN rounded seems modern, but its antiqua forms are much more reductive and geometric, and one might imagine them being produced with a Rotring barrel-nib drafting pen held vertically, with a plastic template.
In contrast, I imagine your uncial as being written freehand, using a "Speedball" round-nibbed calligraphy pen.</div>

The "a" is really a tough sell as well, perhaps double bowl is a better start?</div>

Yes modernist is perhaps not the term, maybe rather *constructivist*. Medievalist-constructivist.

<cite>A huge number of light weight sausage faces have been published, because they are so easy to make …</cite>

yes and because the ladies like them (according to magazines) …  ;-)

I tried to make the capitals a bit smaller and not so heavy. I suppose this blends better with the rest.

Out of curiosity I am interested in your disinterest in italic faces? I remember there is no italics in your latest sans too. Do you follow here typographic conventions from the time of Blackletter type? I think it is an interesting position and I would like to understand the reasoning.

Here is the alternative take on capitals mentioned before:

The bottom line of this shows elongated ascenders (escenders), a path that might be gone further, even to extremes.

Well, than it is probably something else. I though it may be interesting to retain an upper-/lowercase distinction just within the limits of the x-height. Will become peculiar with things like o, s, x, though.

<cite>you should resolve what b and ß will look like in the bold weight</cite>
