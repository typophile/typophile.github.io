  body: "Because the Hamm's brand predates the digital age of type, the lettering
    of the logo must have been hand drawn. I think. And that's precisely what's so
    great about nostalgic graphic design like this example. We cannot expect to replicate
    the same unique charm with short-cut logos created with fonts.\r\n\r\n"
