body: A few years ago, I created this &#34;art deco&#34; font, Blowfish.  I&#39;m
  at the office right now, and just decided that I want to turn this thing into a
  full-character set font...  But before I do, I&#39;d like opinions on the basic
  letterforms &#40;it&#39;s mixed-case and will stay that way, at least that&#39;s
  how I&#39;m envisioning it&#41;.  Here&#39;s the .gif sample.  I&#39;m just looking
  for preliminary opinions, thoughts, critiques before I delve into the rest of the
  character set. <BR> <BR><center> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: Dan. The rounded ends do not remind me of Art Deco. The lowercase j seems
    out of place. Perhaps instead of Art Deco, you could try making into a unicase
    font of somekind? I like the g, there is something very friendly about that character.

  body: Hi Dan, <BR> <BR>I feel compelled to give you feedback since we share the
    same last name. <BR> <BR>I think the J as it stands is interesting, but I would
    personally use a cross bar. The dot is a nice little quirk, but i&#39;m not sure
    if it fits. Or maybe disconnect it? <BR> <BR>Other than that, I would consider
    narrowing the counter space in the 6 just a little, and possibly open up the lower
    counter of the 3. <BR> <BR>But that&#39;s just my two cents. Hope it helps. <BR>

  body: Not that I have clue of what I&#39;m talking about. But I love this font.
    It would be a great web font. I really like the shape of the 6 and agree with
    Ryan, however to me the 9 looks flat incomparison. All your straight line desenders
    go below the baseline, you might want consider extending the 9 or curving the
    tail like the six. The 8 also seems a little out of place visually to me. What
    about using the oval shape at the bottom and the circular shape at the top? I
    agree about the j. But I really love this cleanness and the funkiness of this
    font. I really like the simulated 3d effect it has. It appears to be jumping of
    the page. Let me know when it&#39;s for sale!

  body: No serifs on the i, imo. maybe to match the j. Maybe just a dot or nothing
    would work. In any case the Blowfish sample cries out for an fi ligature.

    for my logo. It is used on my website (www.aerobicdesign.com), business cards,
    invoices, etc. A recent computer crash had the undesired result of my losing many
    of my fonts, including this one. Is there any chance of getting it from you? I
    am trying to avoid having to do a redesign and reprint, especially since I really
    like this font.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nZachariah Crow"
