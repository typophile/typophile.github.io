  body: "I guess it's the latin characters included in a Chinese font.\r\n\r\nChinese
    fonts do have a little tendency for using \"\u0251\" instead of \"a\". For example,
    the STSong shipped with MacOSX uses Garamond as its latin style, except a special
    single-story \"\u0251\"."

  body: "I think it's an entirely different font actually. The shoulders of many of
    the characters are much less pronounced than in Helvetica. It's almost a hybrid
    between and geometric sans and a grotesque.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas I'd
    love to hear them."

  body: "Great spot fvilanakis! \r\n\r\nIt's not perfect, but if you use AG bold condensed,
    put a 0.4 stroke around it and stretch is horizontally 130% it's pretty damn close.
    \r\n\r\nSo much type crime going on!"
