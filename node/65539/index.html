  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have been using this site for years, and now I am taking the leap to ask a question to you pro&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I am designing a catalogue system (think fancy auction catalogue) for print, web and large poster design. For the web I have been working with Franklin Gothic Condensed Book and Medium for headings, and Georgia for bread text. I was trying this for a large poster and for a book layout and all of a sudden felt that I should look elsewhere. Based on a discussion here I found Whitney and Chronicle Text(which I like better than Miller) but ouch they are expensive! I am trying to determine whether it is worth it and also if they work for every medium and sizes I am working with&hellip; I do want consistency.</p>
<p>So my questions:</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I like Whitney is the old style numerics, which I have not been able to find in Franklin Gothic. Are there no such numbers in Franklin Gothic that I can use?</p>
<p>Will Georgia work for a large typographic poster (set in 30 pt) or will that look retarded?</p>
<p>Is there a way I can purchase some single styles of Whitney, say Whitney Condensed Book and Medium, and still get the old style numerics? I am also very interested in the Index White Square Bold and Black Round Bold&hellip;</p>
<p>Will Whitney/Chronicle work on the web, has someone successfully embedded them?</p>
<p>I wish I could buy them both but that means $1000&hellip;</p>
<p>Thankful for any advice!</p>
<p>S</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your comments! I did read about the restrictions regarding use on the web, which maybe makes it impossible for me to use H&amp;FJ fonts&hellip; You also cannot buy single styles from them, but I did email them to see if I could get an educational discount (as I am an academic)&hellip;</p>
<p>I am driving myself crazy here&hellip; I like the numerals of FF Dagny a lot, but want a condensed style. I just love Whitney, it has so much I need&hellip;</p>
<p>I am also struggling with the bread text. Tried to set Minion for print, and it looked better, but don&rsquo;t know if it works with Franklin Gothic? I do like Miller, but not the numerals, especially the &ldquo;1&rdquo; look strange to me. But those forms contrast nicely to Whitney.</p>
<p>I would right now love to have the full Whitney set and the full Miller set!</p>
<p>Ok, rambling. Thanks again for your help, and I might submit my design up for critique once done!</p>
<p>Sincerely, 
S</p>

<p>For Web
Franklin Gothic/Georgia
Whitney/Georgia</p>
<p>For Print</p>
<p>Whitney/Chronicle Text
Whitney/Miller Text
Franklin Gothic/Miller Text
Dagny/Miller Text
Franklin Gothic/Whitman - How humbling that you responded to my post!</p>
<p>Do you have an example where Whitman been used to set poetry and in a cataloging system? I am working on an artist book/publication for a museum show which is to a large extent text based, and I am interested in using it. I am a visual artist and poet.</p>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to express my admiration for your design!</p>

<p>The late [[http://typophile.com/user/7891|Will Powers]] used to like pairing Whitman with Franklin Gothics in books he produced for the Minnesota Historical Society Press.</p>
<p>Regarding poetry: 
[[http://typophile.com/user/23726|Nicola Caleffi]] used Whitman in an Italian book of poetry &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ombre di Luce<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Graziana Bernabei [Sassuolo (Modena): Incontri Editrice, 2009]</p>
<p>[[http://www.chapiteau.org/|Chapiteau Press]] (in Vermont) used a pre-release version of Whitman, back in 2002, for a small chapbook of poetry by Ilya Kaminsky called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Musica Humana<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Whitman is also the primary text face for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[[http://www.vqronline.org/|The Virginia Quarterly Review]]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and is used for setting poetry as well as articles, I believe.</p>
<p>Regarding cataloging systems: I&rsquo;m not sure what to tell you there. Perhaps someone else can offer an example that I&rsquo;m unaware of.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Kent,</p>
<p>Thank you so much! I will take a look at those books. I downloaded the Whitman specs from your website, that was very helpful, especially the note on dashes and special punctuation. I have been looking for an alternative to Scala for quite some time, and think this is it! I am super excited.</p>
<p>Now after looking around some more, I realize that Verlag is a better fit for me than Whitney or Franklin Gothic. I love the numerals and it seems less corporate than Whitney. Do you think it will fit well with Whitman?</p>
<p>A problem I have is that I love the Whitney Index family, and Verlag doesn&rsquo;t come with anything similar, I think! I guess it will be a big mistake to mix Whitney Index and Verlag, but this would give me what I need:</p>
<p>Heading/ wall text/ motion graphics: Verlag Condensed family
Index: Whitney Index Family
Bread (print and web): Whitman</p>
<p>A note on the context: I am designing an artist book that uses the format of an auction catalog. I am inventing a numbering system, and there will be short descriptions for each item. It will accompany an exhibition that uses wall text, which is why I want a museum style typeface. This multimedia exhibition also includes film, and I would love to also use Verlag in the titles. To make things more complicated for myself, I am also creating a version of the catalog for the web. I would love to be able to use the same typefaces, and to get a a more traditional print design feel on the web!</p>
<p>So, my convoluted question is now moving into the web design sphere:</p>
<p>There are two possibilities to make &ldquo;rare&rdquo; typefaces appear on the computer screen :</p>
<p>sIFR (Scalable Inman Flash Replacement) - H&amp;FJ demand that you buy another license for your server to use this</p>
<p>@font-face tag within Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - H&amp;FJ doesn&rsquo;t allow you to use their fonts for this.</p>
<p>There is another option, which is to use static text in Flash, but this is not ideal from a web design point of view.</p>
<p>Has anyone used Verlag and Whitman in a web context successfully? Do you need to buy an extra license to use sIFR with Whitman, and can you use CSS?</p>
<p>I do understand if people are too involved in their holiday shopping to follow my train of thought here&hellip;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sara</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any specific uses of Whitman with Verlag, off the top of my head, but I have always thought they&rsquo;d be potentially compatible.</p>
<p>You will need to speak directly with Font Bureau regarding licensing Whitman for sIFR usage. I do not know the specific policy. Contact Harry Parker at hparker [at] fontbureau [dot] com. Or call the main FB phone number to discuss in person.</p>
<p>I do know that, right now, CSS @font-face &ldquo;embedding&rdquo; is not allowable with Font Bureau retail fonts. FB has said that they are working on a web fonts licensing framework for their library. I would expect more details to emerge in the coming months.</p>
