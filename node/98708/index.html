<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/die-cuts-typophile_4432.png]</p>
<p>Inspired by, among other things, a recent Typophile thread about e-books, I&rsquo;ve decided to show exactly what I have against them, by demonstrating all the tools that are available to a designer of printed, but not electronic, books.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Perks of Print<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a sardonic celebration of the printed word. In this poster series, I subject e-readers and other electronics to the same processes that produce beautiful printed books, and thereby destroy them in the process.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maps-typophile_6285.png]</p>
<p>See more at <a href="http://www.perksofprint.com">www.perksofprint.com</a>.</p>
<p>As I will shortly be starting a production run of these prints, as well as a Kickstarter project to fund the creation of more of them, I&rsquo;d like to hear some responses. Would you want a print? What would you pay for one? Do you have any perks of your own to suggest?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an ironic celebration, not sardonic. I find it absolutely bizarre that you would use something that looks like Photoshop to lament the ways technology has supplanted ink on paper. So you really dig all of the digital tools you now have at your disposal, but resent that production has gone electronic as well as design. I think the title of your poster series should be Hypocrisy.</p>

Die cutting is used in only a tiny percentage of printed pieces, and I don&rsquo;t have any nostalgia for tea-stained maps, so while the layouts are creative they don&rsquo;t resonate with me.

<p>I really like the effort and tricks put into it, but your typography looks placed randomly. It&rsquo;s large, blunt, there is no tension between the picture and the type which makes it interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be too negative, but your ideas could be worked out amazingly with a better finish. The Kindle composition is floating (even without the drop shadow!), sags downwards. The tea one looks like a tea commercial instead of a stand for the merits of print.</p>
<p>Also, you overshoot your point, you make digitally what you dislike, isn&rsquo;t that a contradiction? I think these ideas could be so much better in real cliches, gravures or even better, cyanotype or other vintage photography mediums (no crappy, overdone instagram filters, but go back 100 years!). The pictures are just too &lsquo;finished&rsquo; which makes it hard for the type to compete with it.</p>
<p>I do want to see your other ideas and results though! Good Luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since cars get driven over cliffs for TV commercials, I&rsquo;m not going to get too concerned about wastefulness here.</p>
<p>Print has one obvious perk: physical books have value on the second-hand market; today&rsquo;s DRM technology doesn&rsquo;t offer the equivalent.</p>
<p>And e-books have the advantage that you can fit a library in a pocket.</p>
<p>People can make their own choices based on their rational self-interest; I&rsquo;m not fond of the emotional manipulation techniques used in advertising <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wherever<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they are used, but their use in opposition to previous use by conventional commercial interests at least has the virtue of provoking thought and comment.</p>

<p>There is a practical lowest bottom to the techniques used. I, for one, applaud the idea of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->physically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> abusing e-readers, rather than relying on Photoshop to add the effects. That&rsquo;s the entire point, or so I think.</p>

<p>Please accept my apology JL. The work seemed just like so much that I&rsquo;ve seen where Photoshop is used to electronically mimic printing textures and techniques, and I didn&rsquo;t check the link you provided. However, I still find it ironic even knowing your process was physical rather than digital. But to each his or her own. I imagine that one day when teleportation becomes a reality, people will reminisce about how much nicer it was to wait in airports and ride airplanes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>All right, let me address some of the comments.</p>
<p>Firstly, yes, this is a project with a high degree of irony, and that&rsquo;s completely intentional. It is also a project with a sense of humor, and I hope that comes across, though it may be clearer in some of the zanier posters I have planned.</p>
<p>5star — thanks for your critique. You&rsquo;re right about the second image needing rotation, and you&rsquo;re not the first to provide feedback about the lack of clarity in the first.</p>
<p>The question of finish, as touched on by Arthus, is one that I&rsquo;ve been debating from the start, and I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ve made the right decision. This question has a lot to do with whether I see myself as making fine art prints or more commercial posters, and who the potential audience is — something I&rsquo;m still working through. Certainly, the fact that the posters have a blatant point of view and a corresponding caption really put them more in the realm of pop art or even propaganda, which I don&rsquo;t necessarily mind, though I hope the absurdity of the whole endeavor softens the bluntness a little. I&rsquo;ve thought about shooting some more lyrical photos just focused on the qualities of the electronic devices as objects, preferably on film. This is probably worth pursuing, and would lead to a series of images with a similar theme but very different tone.</p>
<p>More thoughts are always welcome.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s something I was going to mention and forgot. The die cutting one seems to be aimed more at graphic professionals (I suspect that many people in the general public don&rsquo;t even know what the term means), but the tea-stained one seems aimed at a different audience.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As for the point above by James: The audience varies for your first two posters, but I&rsquo;m sure that the gaps will be filled while you continue the project, so that&rsquo;s not a big issue I think.</p>
<p>I think an issue is still the quality difference. Your pictures are really crisp, shiny, studio shots. You need to come with something to offset this since the type falls flat.</p>
<p>Go for the overkill (a waste of the good pictures), or underplay it. I think having a recurring layout theme instead of creating different ones for each poster will help. In the end, I suspect most people will buy the poster for the image and concept anyway. Perhaps have a small white tag in one of the corners with the title and &lsquo;perk&rsquo;, maybe even something logotype-ish.</p>
<p>This will tie all posters together in the end, and at the same time make it a bit of a campaign for the merits of print, which is also what you want to achieve.</p>
<p>My previous comment about the techniques is probably still valid, but I think your current approach will be the better solution the more posters you make, since then the classic techniques don&rsquo;t become quirky any more but boring due to repetition.</p>
