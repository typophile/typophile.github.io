body: My current project is promoting a Jazz Festival. Concept of this festival's
  poster is creating harmony using both typography and abstract images. I want to
  express "rhythm" feeling with typography so that i've been looking through typefaces.
  I've found "Fitzgerald Black" but  it's not Bold enough for my poster design idea.
  Any suggestion for this Jazz Rhythm look typeface?  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5084.jpg]

  body: well, you could start with the obvious 'jazz', which comes installed on a
    lot of macs, grotesque sans serifs were popular as well, plus fonts like neuland
    and berlin... google for 'jazz posters' for layout and colour ideas, or go to
    amazon and look for cd covers... http://www.jazzposters.com/ has a lot of stuff
    as well...

    favourite posters of all time is a black and white poster with a trumpet vertically
    with the names of the players coming from it.\r\n\r\nThis might help\r\nhttp://www.boreme.com/boreme/funny-2003/m_renault-p1.php\r\n\r\nyou
