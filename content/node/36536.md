  frame with the cutline box already tucked neatly below it? This way, it is one motion
  of the mouse, not two. I am using CS3.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it would be a combined
  graphics-and-text frame\r\n\r\nI suppose I can't do this and will just have make
  one for the library. Anyone have an answer?"

    a two-celled table, one of which contains the image and the other the cutline?\r\n\r\n(Haven't
    upgraded to CS3 yet, or I'd give it a try myself...)"
