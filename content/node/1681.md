body: I saw a typeface that had incorporated the actual marks that were made to get
  the letters, circles and lines. <BR>Does anyone know what this is called or where
  I can find it?

    target="_blank">variations of Rubino</a> available, both Sans and Serif, with
    marks and without. Agfa sells these ex-Image Club typefaces through Fonts.com

  body: The Scriptorium also has two fonts of this kind.  One is called Draughtwork,
    and can be found at <a href="http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/draughtwork.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/draughtwork.html</a>.  The
    other is called Roughwork, which I can&#39;t seem to call up on its own page,
    but if you go to the page for Draughtwork and click on the Useful Pages menu on
    the right, you can get to a picture of Roughwork.
