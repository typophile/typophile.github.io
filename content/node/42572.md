    personal, but isn't the point of advertising to create positive associations that
    make you want to buy the product? I don't think of terrorism every time I see
    an airplane, but if I saw a photo of a plane flying over New York you bet I would
    make that association. Those images were distributed widely, globally, and it
    was a recent event still referred to daily in the media. And still used as a hammer
    by the republican administration.\r\n\r\nI doubt Adobe would try to sell Acrobat
    by showing a bunch of guys wearing turbans sitting on a plane."
