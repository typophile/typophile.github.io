body: 'OK, hopefully this isn&#39;t too vague, too easy, or too stupid. <BR> <BR>In
  2000, a translation of ancient poetry written by a Vietnamese concubine and translated
  by a poet from North Carolina State University was published. It&#39;s an interesting
  book not only because the poems are right good, but because it&#39;s published in
  3 languages/scripts: English, modern Vietnamese, and the old calligraphic script
  that the poet actually used. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Name the poet <BR>2&#41; Name the script
  <BR>3&#41; Name the man who created the digital realization of the script  <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ll be online for a few more hours, but then I won&#39;t be back &#39;til
  6 or 7am TST &#40;Typophile Standard Time&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Cheers.'

  body: Obviously that was too easy. Adriano is right. Except that I <i>think</i>
    there&#39;s a circumflex in N&#0244;m. Interestingly, the lines in all but one
    of the poems in the book have the same number of characters per line. I believe
    it&#39;s something akin to the sonnet form in English. <BR> <BR>Take it away.

  body: Hm, yes... Andrea is right, there is a circumflex. <BR>Since I&#39;m not very
    good at formulating questions, Andrea can ask the next one. <BR>Or does that go
    against the rules?

  body: It&#39;s up to Nathan to declare the winner. Technically, Andrea is more correct,
    and Adriano has indicated that he would not object to her posing the next question,
    so I think Nathan would be justified in declaring Andrea the winner. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s
    say that if Andrea does not post a question within the next 12 hours, then Adriano
    will pose the next question.

  body: Alright. I like John&#39;s idea. Let&#39;s say Andrea won due to that picky
    little circumflex. And in lieu of a question in 12 hours, it&#39;s Adriano. Or,
    by Rule 15, you could nominate someone else.

  body: Incidentally, though I have <i>no</i> idea what face it was printed in, <i>Robert&#39;s
    Rules of Order</i> was first printed here in Chicago at Griggs. So I&#39;d say
    the compositors at Griggs did most of the &#34;design.&#34; And, in blatant violation
    of Rule 12 &#40;which probably doesn&#39;t matter since I doubt &#40;hope&#41;
    that we&#39;re starting a quiz within a quiz<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>, I&#39;m guessing Robert served in the Civil War. Which
    wasn&#39;t between Britain and the US, but since I grew up in Tennessee and we
    call Northerners &#34;Yanks,&#34; maybe it&#39;s almost the same...

    <BR> <BR>Nathan, I&#39;m not sure whether Robert served in the US Civil War or
    not, but the conflict to which I was referring was the altogether less bloody
    <a href="http://www.nps.gov/sajh/pig_war.htm">Pig War</a>, the only casualty of
    which was the pig.

    <BR> <BR>Do I? I think not. I didn&#39;t remember that From Russia <BR>with Love,
    an earlier film, used the same concept. <BR>And actually, as I see in the nice
    link you&#39;ve posted, <BR>in Goldfinger - as opposed to FRWL - there were images  <BR>projected
    on the body, but the actual titles were not.  <BR>So I don&#39;t win, and the
    turn reverts to you, I think. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, sorry for the Binder/Brownjohn
    confusion. <BR>Brownjohn was great.
