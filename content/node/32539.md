  this site. I have a Gutenberg coin dated 1837. It appears to be silver and larger
  than a 50 cent piece. It was apart of my mother-n-laws estate. Can anyone shed some
  light as to what these coins were issued for and the value of them."

    in Gutenberg (as the inventor of movable type in the Western sphere) didn't kick
    in with any real zealous until about mid 19th-century and took another fifty years
    to solidify. Even Joseph Moxon (late 17th century and the first writer on printing)
    did not recognize him for his possible contribution as inventor. The grandson
    of Peter Schoeffer (partner of Fust and Gutenberg) had written him out of history
    by 1515. Personally, I think they were correct, but likely, a valuable coin. There
    are better places on the web to find out the value of coins however.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    old medals are pretty specialized knowledge; you probably need to ask a professional
    medals dealer. '
