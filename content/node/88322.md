  sorry for any sort of mix ups. I've been working on a magazine layout and given
  the ability to design for a section has sparked my interest in experimental typography.
  I've seen so much of these very interesting uses of type. \r\n\r\nRecently because
  of research of trying to achieve a specific look for the title of the article I
  noticed these very interesting mixing of different fonts stacking them in all sorts
  of ways, sometimes stacking type both horizontally and vertically. I've seen many
  examples of this. How would I actually achieve this sort of effect? I've been experimenting
  and wondering if all of these variations are done in one text box inside a design
  program or is it a design that is manually placed together with several text boxes?Maybe
  different positioning methods? I don't know if it would be rude to include pictures
  of examples as it's not my own work. Hopefully I'm not confusing you guys. Thanks
  a lot for hearing me out!"

  body: 'Is it a bad idea then? How would I go about designing it? Justifying the
    text? Is it done in one text box or several? Also I see some people that use several
    different fonts. Is that also done in the same way? Mixing serif and sans-serif
    type. I saw this one that had the type stacked in different ways horizontally,
    vertically with brackets hanging outside. By the way thanks for the link. '

    also no \u201Cproper\u201D way of doing this. It all depends on tools at hand
    and how well you can use or hack them. Some of the tools will give you great amount
    of flexibility in setting type in one frame, others don\u2019t. The rest is up
    to you, really."
