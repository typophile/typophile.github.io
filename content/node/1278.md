body: Hello All, <BR> <BR>I thought I had this one licked when I first saw it. I thought
  it was Smudger. Upon investigation though, it didn&#39;t match. Can&#39;t help but
  think it&#39;s familiar. Does anyone have any idea? <BR> <BR>Any help appreciated.  <BR>

  body: Hi James, the problem with typefaces that emulate  <BR>handwriting is that
    there&#39;s a gazillion of them out  <BR>there, and lots of them are in the obscure
    freeware  <BR>department. If you&#39;re lucky someone will recognize  <BR>it straight
    away, if not this could take a while. <BR>I&#39;m really sorry I can&#39;t be
    more helpful. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"

  body: Here&#39;s another sample. I hope this one makes it easier to recognize to
    someone. It&#39;s gone beyond what&#39;s needed for work. I just want to know
    what it is now. I hope this helps.  <BR> <BR>It has a felt tip sort of flavor.
    I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not freeware either.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16343.jpg"

    MyFonts</a> did reveal that  <BR>there are quite a few similar alternatives.

  body: Wow! This was hard. Do you guys ever get obsessed about finding out what a
    particular typeface is? This one wouldn&#39;t let me go.  <BR> <BR>I thought this
    one would have been Adobe or something similar since the Diet Vanilla Coke design
    used Robert Slimbach&#39;s Caflish script. Obviously no one recognizes immediately
    putting that idea out to pasture. Nothing similar at myfonts.com after exhaustive
    searching, nothing at the fontbureau, nothing at fonthaus or houseindustries.
    Since T-26 was included in the myfonts.com search I left it alone. Just for grins
    though and perhaps out of desperation I went to the site, and checked under script.
    Nothing. However, when I saw the tiny down arrow and scrolled down further, there
    was another category--Handdrawn. I clicked it. There in my face was &#34;Aspire&#34;,
    the very font I had been looking for. Designed by One Way Out.  Kind of a surreal
    moment when you find what you&#39;ve been looking for. Whoooo hooo!!

  body: In the future, you might also want to consider looking for handwritten fonts
    in my Script Font ID Guide. &#34;Aspire&#34; was displayed in Part 11, Everyday
    Hand-Printing, right at the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg4.html"
    target="_blank"> top of page 4 &#40;of 19&#41; in that category.</a>

  body: Thanks Yves. It&#39;s an ongoing work that started just over 2 years ago,
    and I have had a lot of help. I have gotten type samples from probably 40 or more
    people scattered all around the world, including some of the foundries and designers
    themselves. It&#39;s been a very gratifying collaborative effort that I am trying
    to make into the most comprehensive Guide to hand-drawn fonts you can find anywhere,
    online or in print. The <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font Reference List</a> that goes with it, lists every
    font and its source, designer and date of design, along with alias names, and
    other information, as well as who supplied the sample, and where it can be found
    in the Guide. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s one of three Font ID Guides I have online at my
    site. The first was <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html" target="_blank">
    The Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide</a>, followed by the Script Font ID Guide, and
    the other current project is the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
    target="_blank"> Sans Serif Font Identification Aid/Guide</a>, which uses 7 letters
    &#40;a, e, g, G, M, R and y&#41; as keys to help identify Sans Serif font families.
    <BR> <BR>I have plans for a Serif Font ID Guide using a similar approach to the
    one in the Sans ID Guide. I have always been dreaming of using an identification
    Key scheme like that used in natural history books to identify fish, plants and
    insects, but applied to fonts. <BR> <BR>Wanna help? I&#39;m always looking for
    volunteers. :-&#41;
