  body: "I sent MyFonts an email and they replied the service is up and running. \r\n\r\nI
    managed to get Brandon Grotesque working on the site, but none of the other fonts
    I tried including Avenir. However, I copy/pasted the provided code in my css as
    explained.\r\n\r\nDespite having deleted the code for Brandon now, this font is
    still working, but the other font codes don't.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   "

  body: In case you're interested, I solved it by pasting the code in the original
    <head> section, instead of going via custom css.
