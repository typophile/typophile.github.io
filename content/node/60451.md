    head, it sounds a lot like regurgitate. That's really not a good association for
    a religious media company!\r\n\r\nAs far as design, the top one looks like jack-o-lantern
    teeth. Or an earthquake. I don't see the media or religious angle at all. \r\n\r\nThe
    bottom one has more potential, but the white letters are illegible. Brutal truth?
    Sound waves are incredibly overused. As a rule I never use anything in a logo
    that's a standard icon already.\r\n\r\nHave you though about doing a simple logotype
    alone instead of a mark? IMO, PR companies are best served by classy, understated
    typography alone. Due to the dynamic nature of promotional work, far too many
    media companies use trendy graphics that don't stand the test of time. Just my
    opinion."

  body: "Hi,\r\nThe name is extremely bizarre! Is it a purposefully misspelled name
    to protect your/client's confidentiality? If not, what's the rationale behind
    it?\r\nIn addition, sound waves are a rather over-used icon. However, I do think
    that the sound waves in the first version are an slightly unusual take on the
    sound-waves idea, suitably different to overcome the straightforwardness. It is
    a specifically Christian media company: do you want this to come across in the
    logo?\r\nWhen designing a logo, I find it useful to consider how it will look
    in black & white (B&W only, not grayscale) - this will help you create a clear
    and uncluttered design. In fact, I'm working on something at the moment where
    this idea would've saved me trouble now, see the thread on Cupcakes!)\r\nHope
    this helps,\r\nH"
