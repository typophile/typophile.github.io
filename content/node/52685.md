  eye my glyphs look skewed.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that a right eye dominant audience

  not?\r\n\r\nI just looked at a few other typefaces this way, I perceived them the

    but it could very well explain what I am seeing.\r\n\r\nBy skewed I meant it looks
    less harmonious, for example an overhang appears to project more or the tension
    of the shape changes. Take a letter like 's' for example. I perceive it first
    as upright, then leaning forwards."

    defect, \r\n\r\n\"Astigmatism (cylindrical defect): When some-one has a cylindrical
    defect, the eye is not spherical. Mostly this appears on the cornea, but it can
    also be somewhere else. Because of this, the light is not broken in one direction,
    and because of that the sight will be distorted. Often this occurs combined with
    long- or short sightedness. It is possible to put this right by using cylindrical
    glasses, lenses or a laser treatment.\" "

    eyes are processed into a representation and that is where it becomes muddy: the
    brain makes decisions about what we want to see and what not. Eg if you are focused
    on things being level, your perception gets tuned to that (the famous carpenters\u2019
    eye).\r\n\r\nMost important is the fact that most people use two eyes and the
    brain mixes inputs. When you use just one eye it takes some time for the brain
    to adapt.\r\n\r\nExample: a few years ago I had my eyes lasered. The right one
    has perfect vision now, which means it is perfectly suited for seeing far off.
    My left eye has been corrected to about minus 2.5 and is well suited for distances
    from 60 cms to about 120 cms (I can use my computer without needing glasses \u2014
    reading is a different matter). My brain picks what it needs \u2014 learning that
    took just a few weeks. \r\nAnecdote: My eye doctor told me that elderly people
    who have their vision restored (removing cataracts and such) sometimes can not
    adapt and remain virtually blind. Or fall over all the time.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert

  body: "You're welcome, 1985! I had to use an eye patch, too. :-) I would alternate
    between covering the right eye one day and the left eye the next. It's usually
    used for what they call \"lazy eye,\" or <a href=\"http://www.preventblindness.org/children/amblyopiaFAQ.html\">amblyopia</a>.
    The idea is that you will force the \"lazy\" eye to work harder on the days you
    cover the \"stronger\" eye. Strabismus is when you are cross-eyed, and that can
    be corrected with surgery. Read more about strabismus and amblyopia <a href=\"http://www.strabismus.org/amblyopia_lazy_eye.html\">here</a>
    (they are not the same thing!).\r\n\r\nTry to go to an eye doctor (that is, an
    optometrist or an ophthalmologist) rather than an optician. In my experience,
    at least, an optometrist or ophthalmologist will do a more thorough check-up on
    your vision. An optician is just going to give you glasses.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"
