body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nMy friend has  diesel tshirt that simply says diesel, but the
  typeface is done in sort of a denmark (futuristic type font) but the style of the
  lettering has been heavily changed and looks sort of alienish while still being
  able to make out the characters and almost sort of a japanese sort of style that
  you might see out of some sort of futuristic Japanese scifi cartoon or something.\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping someone can point into what sort of design style I am talking about, I don't
  have a photo of the logo and can't seem to find it on google. Under Dafont i guess
  it would be known as a Techno/Scifi font, I've checked in there and some of those
  are probably the closet thing I seen resemble it but obviously it isn't, hoping
  someone might be able to show a name for that sort of style.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be great  "
