  body: Oh yeah, great question, I've been wanting to know how to do that for ages
    but just gave up after extensive googling, perhaps this product is for me. My
    issue was wanting to make a logo with a gradient indestructible and friendly for
    large and small applications. Awesome.

    if you only have Macs.

  body: Apparently there's a bit of something you can do to run it on OSX, seems a
    bit complicated/involved for my non-technical mind and I've been a bit busy to
    try it, but it may help, it's <a href="http://fmpfilms.com/Rast/">here</a> and
    check the thread link down the bottom it seems to resolve a few issues that come
    up.

    you a PDF to download.

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI just tried Rasterbator online ( No Mac :o ) and it did ok.\r\nWhat
    i'd like to know is how to get perfect dots in vector format.\r\nI've purchased
    a few halftone dot background clips from iStock, Shutter and Vectorstock.\r\nSeems
    the ones here: http://vectorstock.com/gallery/1078/\r\nhave some clean dots. How
    was this done?\r\nI've tried Illustrator & Photoshop tuts found on the net with
    semi-acceptable\r\nresults but they still looked 'traced'.\r\nDoing these manually
    is a bit rediculous, I know.\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJim"

  body: "If only there were something in the 2D vector genre that did something like
    3D metaballs. It would be relatively simple to space them out on a grid then adjust
    their sizes to the brightness of a linked image. It is the nature of metaballs
    to distort their shapes as their surfaces come within proximity of another metaball,
    which should create the geometric inversion you're looking for.\r\n\r\nThere probably
    is something that does that  but I can't think of it. Best I've been able to manage
    is to generate a super-oversize halftone in Photoshop as dimitre did above and
    autotrace it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I too have found that only Photoshop gives convincing results, although I
    haven't bothered to autotrace, just saved out the very large image as a bitmap,
    then scaled down for use.\r\n\r\nProbably getting away from the original request,
    but maybe printing the resulting image on a laser printer and scanning back in,
    then autotracing, would look even more convincing, giving a bit of dot gain/loss."
