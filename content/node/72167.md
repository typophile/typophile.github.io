  two glyphs that I found and need help identifying. One is a \"W\" which looks like
  someone took a lowercase Didot and chopped off the right facing serifs and the other
  is an ampersand that seems a bit off for me.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help that
  you are able to provide and talk with you all soon\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/doubleu_6546.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersand_6243.jpg]"
