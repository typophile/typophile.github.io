		<div class="commentbody">&gt;If the pleasure is mutual, and not selfish and objectifying, it is not lust. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are defining lust in a way that is 'politically correct' now, but I challenge you to find in any traditional Christian source, including St. Thomas, your view that if pleasure is mutual it is not lust. Here is the Catholic Encyclopedia definition of Lust: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The inordinate craving for, or indulgence of, the carnal pleasure which is experienced in the human organs of generation.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is the strength of desire that is objected to, not whether it is mutual. The plain reading of my earlier quoted passage of St. Thomas is that he objects to having sex with one's wife for the sake of satisfying powerful sexual desire, rather than procreation or other noble purpose not related to your own pleasure. Pursuit of carnal pleasure is in no way seen as legitimate in itself.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;forms of contraception are permitted in family planning <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The traditional approach was to permit birth control fairly liberally on behalf of the woman's heath and the welfare of her children, while prohibiting it on the part of the man. This was part because of the biblical passage about Onan, but also because of, as you note, the mitzvah to be fruitful and multiply - and I suspect the belief that men had a limited supply of sperm. I think this belief, which is false for men and instead true for women's eggs, was based on Galen's mistaken theories of procreation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only the Orthodox (10-15% of Jews) are guided by the traditional analysis, and I don't honestly know what the current application of the tradition is, especially as the Orthodox sometimes differ radically among themselves. The Orthodox are definitely more influenced by the 'pru urvu' (be fruitful and multiply) commandment, and many have large families.</div>

Pursuit of carnal pleasure is in no way seen as legitimate in itself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is the point I have made several times: reducing sex to carnal pleasure is illegitimate. I'm not sure what you think I'm disagreeing with in this traditional teaching. I don't think the fact that you really, really want to get it on is actually a good enough reason for sex. My own view of sex is that one should always be seeking to maximise it; that is, to put as much in and get as much out of the experience as possible. Quite simply, I've found this leads to better sex. This means emotional and spiritual investment, vulnerability, openness and generosity, not just satisfying powerful sexual desire. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to go pack for Prague now, and I fly tomorrow, so I won't be on Typophile for a few days.

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas Phinnery: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, do you honestly know anybody who found wine, beer or scotch to taste good the first time they tried it? It seems to me that these are acquired tastes, and the primary reason they are acquired is because of the effects of the alcohol in them.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But lots of the things we eat and drink are acquired tastes, especially to immature or inexperience palates. There are lots of things that people eat that are not immediately delicious to most people, but many of them are ingredients in the world's great cuisines, without the need for any psycho-chemical effect to encourage people to consume them. People try them and develop a taste for them because they've learned &ndash; if they're fortunate to have been raised on something other than junk food &ndash; that a varied and sophisticated diet is a good thing and that many 'difficult' tastes are worth acquiring. I write this with a glass of Ardbeg beside me: the most complex and atypical scotch I've ever drunk. It has taken me the better part of a year to make my way toward the end of the bottle, and I'm just beginning to really appreciate it. Obviously, at that rate, I'm not getting even a little bit drunk. But I'm having a great time! Cheers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The beauty of &quot;who wouldn't you work for&quot;, is that we do all have a choice. A great question and I've appreciated reading others responses, but the thread could easily be changed to &quot;what wouldn't you watch on tv&quot; or &quot;what magazines wouldn't you read&quot;. We can always change the channel or pick a different magazine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, were you wondering (more or less) which clients would you be willing to quit your job over so as not to have to do work for them? This is a more serious question, I think. The truth is, for me, I do work that I don't want to show others all of the time because I think it doesn't show my true potential. On some level, the proud/arrogant designer level perhaps, I feel pimped doing some of it. But, I don't quit my job because of it. Would you, all who are reading and have posted, quit your job or risk being fired over being handed work for Bush, Disney, McDonald's, Hustler, etc etc ?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Hope it is ok that I did this John.

		<div class="commentbody">I posted it, but I can't stand it (the views of the article, not the discussion below it). My own thoughts are there, and they cover my views on porn, design, etc. It seemed to me that the interesting design-related issues were being set aside so everyone could start moralizing (or de-moralizing) on the subject matter and everyone else's views (I was guilty of a bit of this as well). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know that some people (such as hrant) were part of this discussion elsewhere already. Not that it shouldn't/can't happen here, but there are (as Joe points out) some nicely articulated perspectives there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An excerpt from my post which I think is relevant here: &quot;The point is that Design is complicit in the expression of sex and sexuality in our world, particularly in the mainstream and in popular culture. So how do we address our own roles? I doubt that most of us will ever lay out a porn spread, but how many of us have worked on or will work on a women's magazine, or a perfume ad, or a movie poster, or a beer commercial&hellip; ? How do we address sexuality in our work, which is often the vehicle for expressing/communicating these ideas? Is it appropriate to voice your dissent in the face of a client or employer about sexuality as a marketing device, or should we back off and do the job? Is sexuality a legitimate marketing tool because it is part of everyone on Earth? Or is it something we should avoid because we are sexualizing material objects and manipulating our fellow humans' most basic motivators for profit?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think anyone here would work on child porn. It's the grey areas that are the most interesting to/challenging for me.</div>

I don't know, you would have to ask them). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If people boycott a company, its probably ten times more effective if they write to the company and tell them why they are doing so.
