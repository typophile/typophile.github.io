body: "Hi guys,\r\nI'm creating a font that's quite 'blockish' in shape (rectangular/portrait).\r\nI'm
  learning as I'm working through FontLab Studio. Reading the Manual and practical
  work.\r\n\r\nI was wondering...\r\nIf I had a font that consisted of just, say Capitals
  A-Z and nothing else, and overall the glyphs were, say 5 different widths covering
  the 26 letters, is there a way to automatically ask FontLab to generate the same
  kerning width right across the glyphs, irrespective of the widths.\r\n\r\nI'm reading
  the Manual and trying to understand Auto Kerning, and I can do, and understand the
  kerning of pairs, but I cannot see where or how to ask FontLab to take in every
  eventuality when every unique instance of kerning would arise. Can FontLab do this
  by itself? (of course with me programing it in) Or do I need to kern every pair
  and their relationship to each other.\r\nI'm reading and reading, but just probably
  need a wise head here to either show me a quick way, or the way they do it best.\r\n\r\nI
  hope I've made it clear, and haven't confused you guys.\r\nThe more insights from
  you guys, the more I learn.\r\nThanks\r\nKind Regards\r\nDrj\r\n\r\n"

    monospaced font would not need kerning. That would defeat the purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I would think a 'blockish' 'rectangular' all-caps design would need minimal or
    even *no* kerning.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure what the point of the question is exactly.\r\n\r\n"

    it probably needs no kerning (or only a touch). But it will have to be properly
    spaced. I don't think you want to auto-spaced the font. But the whole Uppercase
    alphabet could be spaced in a very short time."

  body: "Sorry if I have confused people, and hopefully I am writing in a manner that
    is clear and correct to wiser heads.\r\n\r\nI fully understand Terminaldesign's
    opinion on kerning and laziness.\r\nI am a Graphic Designer of many years and
    would hate a fully automated process that for instance, automated a t-shirt design,
    or a logo, or business card art, or web graphics, etc.\r\n\r\nBut more my question
    was related to the things you can control.\r\nHere's a wider example, and hopefully
    this helps.\r\nSay the font was regimented by being blockish and you wanted the
    same kerned relationship between all the glyphs.\r\nNow we have 200 glyphs and
    within those 200 glyphs we have 59 different widths.\r\n(The 200 glyphs fit into
    59 widths)\r\nAnd you know the same spacing you want across all 59 width occurrences,
    because however stupidly, you think it looks good!.\r\n\r\nSo, is it possible
    to ask FontLab to look at all possible occurrences of all glyphs, irrespective
    of width, and equally kern them? Or doesn't FontLab need to know the width to
    automatically kern fonts?\r\n\r\nApologies, if I'm asking a stupid question. I'm
    learning and I just wondered if this was feasible. I already know that professional,
    individual (and time consuming) kerning of glyphs is the correct and professional
    thing to always do. Just wanted to know that if you had a regimented situation,
    was this possible.\r\n\r\nThanks Again for any insights."

    kerning or spacing. Straight-to-straight, round-to-round, straight-to-round, diagonal-to-round,
    etc., these basic relationships are what you should be concerned with. An H and
    an I have different widths, but they are treated essentially the same from a spacing

  body: "Jack, I think we have a breakdown in communications here -- I suspect because
    of terminology. \r\n\r\nKerning is only for exceptions to the base spacing. Sidebearings
    are the parameter that determine base spacing.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, you
    have a blockish design with letters of various widths. You want the spacing between
    these characters to be exactly the same with every combination of letters. I'm
    going to assume that by \"blockish\" you mean that every letter has straight sides,
    even \"round\" ones. You want mathematically equal space between them.\r\n\r\nIf
    all this is true, this is not a case for kerning. You just need to set the sidebearings
    for every glyph to be exactly half of your desired inter-letter space. You could
    use Actions > Metrics > Set Sidebearings to help facilitate this.\r\n\r\nIf this
    description doesn't help, then you may need to provide visuals to help us understand
    what you're after.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    of fonts over the last 18 years, and I can't tell you how many times contemplating
    the kerning and spacing have resulted in the redrawing or fine-tuning of a glyph.
    I review all the kerning and spacing and drawing of all interpolated instances.

  body: "> <em>if you have not read the \u2019from moleskine to market\u2019</em>\r\nPossibly
    many people here have read it. But I do not think this would help, as exactly
    the kerning tools mentioned there are not publicly available (and Tal Leming seems
    not to answer personal emails).\r\n\r\nDrjack: honestly, I would recommend at
    least doing the metrics by hand, or you'll never learn to do it right; FL contains
    some AutoMetrics feature, as well as a kind of auto-kerning. But:\r\n\r\n1: They
    are far from perfect.\r\n2: Any kind of automatic setting these values won't spare
    you the prolonged reading of printed texts, laid out with your font - to correct
    the kerning gaps. And sometimes fixing the autogenerated values is not less obnoxious
    than spacing and kerning everything by hand from the beginning.\r\n3: Any auto-spacing/kerning
    depends heavily on the letterforms. The more you sway away from the classical
    letterform, the more uneven auto-values you will get. I.e. if the font is blocky,
    the autospacing/kerning has some sense (although better to avoid it altogether).
    If you fancy curly designs... better avoid it.\r\n4: After all, you are still
    learning, and time-suckers like spacing and kerning are <strong>required</strong>
    to learn to do it right. If you prefer, later you can rely on auto-generation
    tools (even the masters sometimes get lazy), but training the eye to see the 'gaps'
    in spacing/kerning would do much better service to you in the future.\r\n5: And
    finally, would you feel this font is 'yours', if at least a half of the work on
    it was done by someone/something else?\r\n\r\nIf you are mostly interested in
    experimenting/learning, I would recommend you to start by designing monospaced
    font - better to learn to do letterspacing only, than compensate bad metrics with
    extensive kerning. If you can do this, later you could do... well, <em>almost</em>
    anything. \r\n\r\nOn more practical note: Eh, if Metrics Machine was publicly
    available for licensing... I'm getting tired doing everything the hardest way
    in FL."
