  His ideas are pretty cool, and I love his proposed method of sketching type (shading
  the front rather than filling an outline). I'm wondering how accepted his ideas
  are in this decade, and how much his theories hold up against today's ideas and
  styles.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear <em>any</em> thoughts about [[Gerrit Noordzij|Noordzij]]!"

    their distance from type.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm actually going to agree with that statement.
    With regard to the analysis of writing, I'd say Noordzij's ideas are fundamental,
    i.e. you can't really understand the characteristics of written forms without
    them; whereas with regard to type they are merely often useful."

  body: 'John, I think your "merely", while true, is misleading. There are very few
    writers who say anything at all which is both useful and original about type design.
    So "merely" puts Noordzij into a very exclusive club. Wouldn''t you recommend
    The Stroke as very valuable reading for any budding type designer? '
