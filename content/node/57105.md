body: "Hi,\r\n Currently I am creating a letterhead and resume for myself. I've used
  the typeface Din Bold-Condensed for my name, and important copy. I'm looking for
  something that pairs really well with it. I've been using Baskerville thus-far but
  something seems a little off. Does anyone have any suggestions? I think what is
  throwing me of is the fact that Din is so condensed. I would prefer not to change
  this because I'm happy with it, I just need to find the copy that goes well with
  it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I''d think Eureka might actually work. Since DIN is so ... rigid, you need
    an angular serif (can''t think of any at the moment) and maybe a semi-bold weight
    to match your DIN Bold Condensed. Baskerville is far too rounded and delicate
    to really "compliment" DIN. '

  body: "I've been testing out different sans serifs actually, and I'm kind of liking
    frutiger. The question is.. If I'm going to do sans serif, should I just stay
    with DIN all the way. I'm still looking for a serif that works well tho\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help so far"

    large. Then try PMN Caecilia.\r\nFor \"normal use\" try FF Nexus Mix or Nexus
    Serif.\r\nHmm, generally i don't like the idea searching for a squarish serif
    to go with FF Din \u2013 and never saw a squarish serif going well with FF Din.
    Show me! \r\n\r\n\r\n"
