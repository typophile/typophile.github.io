body: "We\u2019ve been dancing around this topic for months. Typophile functions all
  right most of the time. This is not a ringing endorsement, nor is it a reason not
  to fix what doesn\u2019t work. Typophile is a Web forum about typography. It has
  to succeed as a Web forum first and foremost. It isn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nThe fact that
  you don\u2019t even notice when Typophile fails does not mean your own inability
  to notice the obvious should prevail. If you think Typophile is running just fine,
  then you won\u2019t mind, or even notice, if we improve things. If you don\u2019t
  know enough to recognize what Typophile is doing wrong, you shouldn\u2019t expect
  to get your way.\r\n\r\n<h3>We\u2019re all experts here</h3>\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re all
  experts on typography here  \u2013 save for the many spammers and their close cousins,
  students who show up out of nowhere and expect us to write their homework assignments
  for them. Except for those groups, we all know a great deal about typography. We
  might be polite about it, but we wouldn\u2019t sit around and let ignorant outsiders
  tell us that everything should just be typeset in Arial (and Times \u201CNew Roman\u201D)
  because who can tell the difference?\r\n\r\nWe can. We have expertise.\r\n\r\nSome
  of us have expertise in online discussion fora. In my case, circa 11 years\u2019
  worth. At least one of my colleagues on this site also knows how things should really
  be run. I\u2019m not going to pretend I don\u2019t know more than most of you about
  this topic. I\u2019m not going to pretend to be humble about it, either. If you
  accept typographic expertise on Typophile then you have to accept online expertise
  on Typophile.\r\n\r\nFirst among equals in Web fora is <a href=\"http://MetaFilter.com\"
  title=\"MetaFilter\">MetaFilter</a>, which just celebrated its tenth anniversary.
  I\u2019m <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/user/250\" title=\"joeclark\">user
  250</a> (user 100,000 was just allocated) and I\u2019ve been there since year one.
  MetaFilter has learned a few things about what works and what doesn\u2019t. Often
  they\u2019ve learned things the hard way. But that\u2019s over and done with. A
  great many techniques of forum moderation and cultivation are now settled facts,
  not just a difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nHence a lot of the complaints I\u2019ll
  be making would be resolved if Typophile ran more like MetaFilter. (Great artists
  steal.) This is not the time to defensively claim that Typophile isn\u2019t like
  MetaFilter (in all important respects it is) or that what works at MeFi won\u2019t
  work here (it will). You don\u2019t really mean that and you don\u2019t have enough
  knowledge or evidence to back it up. I do.\r\n\r\n<h3>Defensiveness</h3>\r\n\r\nI
  find the defensiveness and evasiveness of Typophile apologists and its shadowy so-called
  \u201Cmoderators\u201D particularly enraging. Typophile <em>needs fixing</em> in
  important ways. To repeat an earlier point, if you can\u2019t tell the difference
  between Typophile as we currently know it and a properly functioning Typophile,
  you don\u2019t have enough expertise to help. \u201CI like things just the way they
  are\u201D isn\u2019t a viable argument. (\u201CI don\u2019t like your tone\u201D
  also isn\u2019t.)\r\n\r\nI will be posting a separate bug about the complete inadequacy
  of Typophile admins (as they are properly called), but the fact they sit there and
  stammer out justifications for their own failings when one somehow manages to contact
  them is, again, a bug, not a feature.\r\n\r\nTypophile needs improvement. It starts
  today."

    \r\n\r\nI'm not clear who the Typophile people are or what their strategy and
    mission might be. Technically, this website runs ok, but without knowing management's
    remit, it's hard to tell if 'ok' is ok."

    is a definite gold standard. Endless threads about should this post have been
    deleted, why was it deleted, someone quit because it was deleted, ooh what a shame
    we are really going to miss them, if it hadn't been deleted maybe this wouldn't
    have happened, etc\u2026 They could have just been \"admins\" and removed the
    link, but no.\r\n\r\nIt is all eerily similar to what Adobe forums just did -
    they cleaned house, encouraged users to \"turn\" each other in, brought in a bunch
    of new mods who stuck to the rules and totally revamped the site.\r\n\r\nThe result:
    a bunch of folks who had been posting there for years left.\r\n\r\nYour approach
    is too control oriented - what is good here is the freewheeling approach - topics
    going completely off course and coming back again, etc\u2026\r\n\r\nOf course
    in my case there might be some serious sentiment to tighten the reigns. :)\r\n\r\npbc\r\n"

  body: "Joe, I agree with a lot of your points, but I think they would be better-received
    if you were an actual contributing member of this community and not someone who
    only writes criticisms of this forum and its posters. When was the last time you
    made a post that provided a valuable contribution to a thread's content?\r\n\r\nPlease
    stop your 'sperging, and let this forum be. I agree that this forum could use
    improvements, but I also think that the number-one improvement that could be made
    to this forum is to get rid of \"gimmick\" posters like you and Uli who have become
    caricatures of themselves.\r\n\r\nMetaFilter is not the only good forum on the
    internet, and not every forum should be modeled after it. You insist that Typophile
    is a web forum first, but I think that you are wrong. Typophile is a community
    first, with a web forum that supports that community.\r\n\r\nEDIT: When I was
    in middle school I posted to a forum about Iron Chef. It was a very enjoyable
    experience, posting with like-minded people about a mutual interest. Then Iron
    Chef America aired, and fans of Iron Chef America came in, and the forum just
    turned into one giant argument over which show was better. These arguments were
    fun, because arguing over the internet is fun, but the novelty soon wore off.
    Typophile works for what it is \u2014 a place for people who share a passion about
    type to share healthy discussion and education about type. I have gained so much
    valuable type education from these forums, and in the past few months it has become
    less useful because nearly every thread is taken over by either your criticisms
    of how the forum is run or Uli's questionable legal advice. I know you think that
    you can help this forum, but the biggest way you can help it is to stop posting
    about how you can help the forum."

  body: "I don't actually know a lot about the corporate structure of Typophile, largely
    because I am not all that interested. I supost if it were to disappear tomorrow
    I'd become more interested, but that doesn't seem all that immanent, so I'll forget
    i said that for now.\r\n\r\nWhat is apparent is that it is nobody's fulltime job
    to manage the site, so unless I were willing and able to jump in and lend a helping
    hand, i'd tend to keep my thoughts to my self. That's just me, perhaps. No criticism
    of Joe intended. I like the site. I learn a lot here. "

  body: Joe, the operating philosophy behind Typophile is obviously very different
    from the operating philosophy you're advocating.  I think you stand a chance of
    making headway by suggesting that certain technical aspects of the website need
    improvement, but I don't think you'll get much traction suggesting radical philosophical
    changes.  I suspect the only way to get the kind of results you have in mind is
    by starting your own internet type forum with yourself as supreme moderator.

  body: "Russell, the question of volunteer vs. paid (not really vs. full-time) administrators
    is a common one in online fora. And my answer is I don\u2019t really care; I just
    want results. \u201CWe\u2019re all just volunteers here\u201D is really an excuse
    for half-assed work. Why not improve the existing volunteers\u2019 skills, or
    find new ones?\r\n\r\nThe only sites I know with paid admins are MetaFilter and
    Slashdot. (I\u2019m not referring to people who do nothing but respond to terms-of-service-violations
    complaints, which many, many sites have.) It helps, but it\u2019s so rare that
    it doesn\u2019t scale as a solution to the problem. Skills are the solution. One
    can learn those without a paycheque and in one\u2019s spare time."

    out of these discussions (and this is the only post I'll make in them). \r\nThe
    point of this site has never been to demonstrate how a perfect web forum works.
    The point of the site is simply to enable the amazing richness of content, shared

    than most other resources out there. And maybe that's why \u2013 and also actually
