  body: "If by a substitute you mean a similar \"old style\" looking font, then Al
    Bayan could do though it has a rather poor set of ligatures.\r\nBut if, shameless,
    self-promotion is allowed I'd suggest you check my (freely available) [[http://www.amirifont.org|Amiri
    font]] which have rather a very rich set of contextual forms and covers almost
    all Unicode 6.0 Arabic block."

    equivalent - if I could add my opinion.
