    and very powerful. I know very few about Mac, but, AFAIK, it works well under
    Mac OS X (you must have the X11 server installed in order to run FontForge).'

  body: "With just 9 icons, I guess you can import them individually. Save each one
    in a .svg file. Then in Fontforge, you select the slot where you want to put the
    icon, open it (say double click) and then in File > Import you select \"SVG\"
    instead of \"Image\" and then click the file you want to import.\r\n\r\n[edit]
    On the <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\">fontforge site</a> there
    is a pdf tutorial (second bullet)."

  body: "You can also try saving your images as EPS rather than SVG. But of course
    I don't know what your images look like: it might be possible that they are indeed
    more complex than any font editing software can understand.\r\n\r\nIf nothing
    else helps, you can subscribe to the [[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fontforge-users|fontforge-users
    mailing list]] and ask about your problem there."
