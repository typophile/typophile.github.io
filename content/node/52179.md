body: "In Fontlab Studio, under OpenType Specific Names there's a third field called
  Mac Name. I usually leave it blank. When I hit Build Open Type Names it fills Mac
  Name with the contents of Full Name on the previous page.\r\n\r\nIf I enter \"Bill
  Gates Rocks\" in this field, where will it show up in an OTF or a Win TTF? Who will
  see it? Are there advantages to leaving it blank or not leaving it blank?\r\n\r\nI
  have to generate a few hundred OpenType fonts and was wondering if I need to blank
  out that field a few hundred times or not."

    backwards compatibility towards older Mac OSes."

  body: "I read both of those threads again. I still don't understand what should
    go in the Mac Names field or which applications on which OS it will appear. Unilinear
    suggested:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Open Type Mac name should be The two other opentype
    names combined, seperated by a space, correct? Then why does Fontlab put the FOND
    name in there in stead when you hit the 'diamond' (auto-generate names) field?</cite>\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I can see, nobody answered his question. Is he correct? The two other opentype
    names combined, seperated by a space. Or leave it blank?"

    one with the green jewel and one with your avatar. Clicking on the Adam button
    would fill in all the name fields properly.'
