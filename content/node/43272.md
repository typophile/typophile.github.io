  body: "It\u2019s Apex indeed. Thanks.\r\nI had never heard of it.\r\n\r\nBut it
    really looks like Klavika, \r\nwhich i\u2019ve been seeing around a lot lately.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, it seems there\u2019s a trend \r\ngoing on with the design (and the use)\r\nof
    sans serif fonts like these. \r\n\r\nFor me it all started with Thesis <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?L6\">TheSans</a>.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone knows an earlier example?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This older thread lists <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/28458\">\u2018some
    recent square sans designs\u2019</a>. \r\n\r\n<cite>For me it all started with
    Thesis TheSans</cite>\r\n\r\nI, for one, would never have made the connection
    to [[Thesis]]. To me, [[Thesis]] is a milestone, too. But I rather see it in the
    tradition of the [[sans serif|humanist sans]], a thing started by [[Syntax]] or
    [[Frutiger]]; expanding this formal principle into a massive clan (like [[Corporate
    ASE]], [[Stone]] or [[Rotis]]) \u2013 but with a wide and well-balanced repertoire
    of weights (like [[Univers]]).\r\n\r\nThe recent square sans thing is more \u2013
    well \u2013 square, i.e. not-so-humanist, rather technical. Then again, as Chris
    has mentioned in that thread, Camingo was designed by [[Jan Fromm]], a former
    student of [[Luc(as) de Groot]]. So, yes, there is a connection.\r\nF"
