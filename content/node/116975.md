  body: Thanks. I was thinking its shapes were very much like Calibri, but there's
    no thin version of Calibri and the ends seem more straight and less rounded than
    Calibri's. But you certainly could be right. It may be thinned after the fact.
    Great...now I gotta start the thinning...

    body: Yeah that's what I ended up doing. Played with a couple different stroke
      widths until it looked about right and trimmed them off. Looks identical now.
      Thanks for pointing out Calibri as I was completely in the mindset that it must
      be an actual font and not a modified Calibri until you mentioned it.

  body: To conclude, find a reputed insurance company. There are many insurance companies
    that offer home insurance. You can find them online. A big <a href="http://www.thepropertyinsurer.co.uk/">home
    insurance company</a> will allow you to shop their policies online. So, get your
    home insured and live a risk-free and care-free life.
