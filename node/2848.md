    though not precisely.

    <BR> <BR>Heh. Sully. Heh. <BR> <BR>Actually, Fajita isn&#39;t perfectly clean
    or innocent either. It&#39;s based on a Solotype face called Sara Elizabeth. We
    added a ton of original alternates and a full glyph set to make it more Image
    Club, but of course it wasn&#39;t <i>all</i> our own.'
