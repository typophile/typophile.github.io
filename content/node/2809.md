body: TypeCon2004 is going to be the shiznit this year! Before that, however, I don&#39;t
  want to miss out on any of the inside information so I was just on my way to renew
  my membership. Does anyone want to join me? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typesociety.org/memjoin.html"
  target="_blank">http://www.typesociety.org/memjoin.html</a> <BR> <BR>Wow! I just
  found out that if you join as a professional plus member for $90, you also get a
  free FontZone subscription, AND a copy of either Indie Fonts, Indie 2, or the Metro
  Letters book from the Typeface Twin Cities project &#40;shipped post paid&#41;.  <BR>
  <BR>Count me in!!
