body: "I found this book, an older one (don't know what era), with some nice specimens
  in it.\r\nThere was this one font that I love very much. It features similar geometrical
  shapes as DIN Mittelschrift. Actually, it has the same feel to it. But it clearly
  is not.\r\n\r\nDoes someone have any idea if this typeface has been available commercially,
  if it has been finished anyway. Or maybe (a) typeface(s) that looks like this one.\r\n\r\nThe
  type specimen did not contain the whole alphabet, unfortunately. So hopefully the
  available characters are enough.\r\n\r\nI always seem to like characters like these.
  So hopefully someone knows this one or a similar one.\r\n\r\nThnx in advance."

  body: "Termopolium: yeah, I thought so too. Nice characters over-all. I can see
    if I can scan some more pages of the book. Although some of the other specimen
    are of typefaces that are a bit better known (like old english newspaper headers
    and such), or not too good at all. But the book is at my school somewhere, so
    I can always try to get it back.\r\n\r\nStephenColes: Yeah, that 'Wilma' typeface
    looks quite similar indeed. Might check into that one. Thanks.\r\n\r\n(I'm new,
    so I don't see how I can quote messages... oh well.)\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\n\r\nActually,
    I think Wilma might be it. If not, it's at least 99% the same. "

    body: "I think the font can indeed orginally come from a wood type. Since the
      book contains alot of older typefaces. So he might be right.\r\nAlthough that
      'Wilma' is practically the same, or the same. \r\nSo that one might have been
      traced from the wood type as well?"

    can't remember what book I scanned it from!  :-/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/optical_corr_4106.jpg]\r\n\r\nI

      old and worn. It could have been torn out or something.\r\nYour image does,
      however, look like the same book, or at least the same page. It's the same typeface
      anyway. ;)\r\nAnd I too remember not liking a lot of typefaces in the book,
      exept this one.\r\nWell, the next time I get to school, I will check and see
      if I can get my hands on the book again for the title.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
      reply. :)\r\n\r\nStepen Coles: Well, I guess the typeface is called Railroad
      then. Nice to know it (Wilma) is available commercially for modern use. Thanks.\r\n"

    body: "hrant, I found the book! It took a while because I couldn't exactly remember
      which one it was.\r\n\r\nIt is called:\r\n\r\n\"130 alphabets & other signs\".
      \r\nIt's from Redstone Press, London,  1991.\r\nEdited by Julian Rothenstein
      and Mel Gooding.\r\nISBN: 1870003268 (hardback)\r\nISBN: 1870003500 (paperback,
      the one I had)\r\n\r\nAnd for good measure, the text on the back says:\r\n<cite>\"ALPHABETS
      AND OTHER SIGNS brings together 130 rare and unusual alphabets and a wealth
      of printers' signs, monograms, logos and trademarks. Containing original essays,
      pages from ARTS ET M\xC9TIERS GRAPHIQUES, the great pre-war French magazine
      of printing, and many other surprises, it is a uniquely unconventional collection
      of fascinating visual material. Designed also for practical and creative use,
      it will be an invaluable resource book for artists, poets, typographers and
      other professionals of the letter, word and sign.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, that was
      basically it. I think the typeface has been identified. Digitized it's probably
      Wilma, the woodtype was called Railroad I think."
