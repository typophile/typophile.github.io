  and want to produce some work while I have the time. The problem is setting myself

  project that would be beneficial to my portfolio. <BR>Thanks for any ideas, <BR>David.

  body: My work is all print at the moment and I want to continue with some print
    projects. I have some business cards , letterheads already so I want to move away
    from that and give my portfolio a better range of work. <BR>I have done some work
    for the National Aids trust, It was for a competition, Ill look up some charities
    but I dont want to just produce posters. Im looking for something that will deal
    with alot of type. I was thinking about a cd &#43; booklet but am afraid alot
    of places I will try to get a job with will not have alot of experience with cd&#39;s
    themselves. So something that future employers have dealt with. I know I should
    be able to think of something, Its just difficult to set your own project and
    create a brief. But Im thinking along of a theatre production program. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for any help, <BR>David.

  body: 'A theatre productuon programme is a good idea. A 3- or 4-panel brochure can
    also be in interesting project: not too large, easy to include in a portfolio,
    but with potential for relatively complex interraction of text and image.'

  body: 'This reminds me of a student project that the Underware guys described during
    their ATypI presentation. A bunch of their students went out and found a small
    cafe with really bad signage: the project was to redesign the signage for the
    cafe, and then take the redesign to the owners and see if they want to implement
    it. The last bit didn&#39;t go too well: the owners of the cafe were immigrants
    who didn&#39;t speak the local language well enough to understand what the students
    were asking; they thought the students were from the immigration police <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    and produce a newsletter that at best is bad. Try contacting a non-profit in your
    area they always need help and don&#39;t have the money but can give you exposure
    and they will be real projects. '

  body: Hey. <BR> <BR>No-profits will definitely give you a lotta work. And they&#39;re
    a great learning experience for students, like myself. <BR> <BR>Learn How To Work
    Under A Deadline! <BR>Experience Approval By Committee! <BR>Deal With Tight Budgets
    And Kinkos Level Output! <BR>Variety! Postcards! Newsletters! Posters! T-Shirts!
    <BR> <BR>And something I plan on doing one of these days is some guerilla show-flyering.
    Find an upcoming show that appeals, create a kick-&#149;&#149;&#149; poster for
    it and cover the town with it. No pay and some out-of-pocket expense, but it&#39;d
    be fun and might get ya noticed &#40;if ya include contact info for the designer&#41;.
