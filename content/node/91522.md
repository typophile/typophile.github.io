  body: Instead of just pointing you in a direction you've probably already went,
    I will actually recommend something for you. You can try out Cargo Collective
    or Wix. I prefer Cargo because of the super simple approach to the layouts and
    design of the templates. Wix is decent too, and a little more fancy, but a free
    site through them will have ads and they are a bit slower to load.

  body: Depending on your comfort level and budget there are a number of options.
    Cargo is nice, 4ormat is another. You can try indexhibit or even a wordpress template.
    Places like woo themes of themeforest will have them in spades.
