    more than small ones.\r\nThe reason is that a small paper can use Quark or InDesign,

  body: "<cite> > Hard to believe that huge news companies don\u2019t have composition
    systems that include basic typography elements.</cite>\r\n\r\nNot all that hard
    for me to believe, actually. Consider: Through much of the 20th century, the vast
    majority of newspapers used Linotype systems for setting their newspapers. As
    we all know, Linotype metal technology did not allow for kerning. Most faces included
    f-ligatures, but they were time-consuming to implement, so they weren't really
    used in newspapers. (Imagine if you had to actually type shift-option-5 every
    time you wanted an \uFB01 ligature, instead of today's software handling it for
    you.) But since Linotype f's were designed not to crash, it wasn't really an issue.\r\n\r\nI
    can imagine a pretty straight line from that predominant newspaper technology
    through the development of digital pagination systems for newspapers, with the
    result that today there are still many such systems without the kinds of typographic
    niceties that we take for granted in other applications.\r\n\r\nI'm not defending,
    just trying to reason out an explanation.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    to be. I know you are not defending, Kent :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    24 hours (or sooner). Quality may have been higher when craftsmen were doing the

    at any newspaper how many proofreaders are left. If there are any, it will be
    less than 5% of what there was 40 years ago. Are reporters spelling better? I

  body: "My thinking is that part of it is newspaper culture being accustomed to minimal
    typographic niceties. The other part is that the original development of pagination
    systems, following on what came before, probably did not put a premium on new
    features. There is a good chance that much of the layout infrastructure is still
    built upon something very close to the initial systems. The older and larger the
    paper, the more likely that would seem to me.\r\n\r\nNewspapers are massive undertakings,
    with very intricate and interdependent editorial & design interfaces/workflows.
    I don't have first-hand experience with newspaper systems. But I would guess that
    implementing even very seemingly straightforward refinements might be more difficult
    than one might otherwise assume.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    the \"no lig\" types I've done for newspapers--Chicago Tribune, Globe and Mail,
    Daily Express (Worldwide), and Nicholas (not for a specific newspaper).\r\n\r\nThe
    arm of the f has to work with the shape and position of the i (and j) and l (b,
    h, etc.)\r\nIt's actually not as difficult as it would be for a text type, as
    those have a lot of width to \"f\", and large features. So it's easier to tuck
    the ball of \"f\" and the dot together in display type. Nonetheless, it can sometimes
    be a bit of a trade-off, and I think the ball of the Chicago \"f\" and the ear
    of the Nicholas Bold \"f\" are a bit twee, but not hopelessly so, and they do
    combine neatly.\r\n\r\nLigatures may not really be appropriate for headline type,
    in as much as they are too fussy for news. So they have the opposite effect to
    their original function at text size. Is it possible that for ordinary readers
    the typophile-offending example Chris posted is fine, and a ligature would be
    problematic?!\r\n\r\nIMO the ideal solution is a \"ligature\" glyph (or contextual
    alternates), but with non-ligating forms nuanced for good fit, but of course,
