  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I created this mock up type treatment for a logo. It&#39;s only
  really for practice in letterform construction, but I&#39;d really appreciate your
  feedback on it, so as to tighten it up. Looking at it now, I&#39;m starting to think
  the &#39;a&#39; is optically a little narrow. What do you think? <BR> <BR>thanks!<img

    here it is: i&#39;m no expert so take all advice with a grain of salt. <BR>that
    said, i think you&#39;ve got a good start here. <BR>very clean, crips letter forms.
    i find the a is particularly interesting. <BR>one thing i noticed: the modulation
    on the e and s is not as well done as the a, n and r. <BR>put a bit more stress
    on those letters and perhaps in the crook of the f.'

    Maybe you should try to incorporate some more of the &#39;a&#39; letter forms
    into the &#39;e&#39;.. &#41; <BR> <BR><i>By the way, there is a mighty bank in

  body: I like it, my only concern is the letter &#39;r&#39; it looks like the letter
    &#39;n&#39; cut in half. Give it some distinction. I think you should incorporate
    some elements from the letter &#39;a&#39; on to the letter &#39;r&#39;. BTW, ditto
    on Paul&#39;s disclaimer. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: Also, maybe you should strengthen the terminal on the letter &#39;a&#39; it
    looks a little flimsy. maybe if you made it a litte wider or shorter, play around
    with it. <BR> <BR>IM
