body: "Hi I accidentally found <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/32397\">this article</a>
  (and many others following) while searching other typographic related stuff over
  your forums, and I was suddenly shocked by the general misunderstandings that westerner
  people have about [[Cyrillic]] language and alphabet, so I\u2019ve updated the sections
  of your site concerning the disputed language and writing system. I found it very
  non-polite and offending that a group of people professionally involved in typography,
  which I may consider for high educated, have so little knowledge about a culture,
  for which they actually are trying to produce typefaces.  \r\n\r\nAnd two more remarks:\r\n
  I\u2019m not trying to produce a cultural scandal\u2026\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t actually
  believe all those Russian authors, cited in your posts \u2013 do not forget that,
  in the time of our little (45 years) of Russian occupation of Bulgaria, a rumor
  was widely spread that the actual developers of Cyrillic alphabet were from Russian
  origins\u2026. \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nKateliev\r\n\r\nPS: in the coming weeks,when
  i have time, i'll try to upload some works of famous Bulgarian typographers that
  are worth mentioning "

    get it, is it us westerners who are the problem, or is\r\nit simply anybody who
    disagrees with your personal views?\r\n\r\nParticipation, especially from \"natives\",
    is always highly valued, and whenever there really is something wrong with what
    we believe we're generally gracious and wise enough to admit/fix it. But pretending
    a single person knows The Truth is laughable. So please do upload anything you'd
    like (especially concerning Eastern European typography, which doesn't get enough
    coverage) but don't get too angry if some people think your views are incorrect.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    matter of blaming somebody (person,nation) it's just simple truth, you have probably
    seen my update of the Cyrilic section which has nothing to do with my personal
    opinion, but it is a simple fact - a historical fact. And how actually, can I
    not get angry, when the original post (about cyrillic aphabet) was talking that
    the other slavonic nations were some sort of proto russian cultures... \r\n\r\nBut
    all that is no mather of discussion of this forums, cause they are typographically
    not politally oriented, so consider the theme colsed..."

    sorry that you feel this way. regarding the [[typowiki]], it is quite imperfect
    and incomplete and in some ways leaves much to be desired when compared to Wikipedia.
    However, those who contribute do so in good faith and with no malice or political
    agenda (i believe) and statements made in the wiki article that you changed were
    not meant to offend. i am sure there are several contributors here on typophile
    who understand the history of the Cyrillic script very well, but have not taken
    the time or made the effort to contribute to the article in question, so i am
    glad that you want to make sure that typophiles have access to the facts concerning
    the development of the Cyrillic script. However, as a rule, typowiki authors are
    encouraged to avoid copying from other sources and pasting directly to the typowiki
    as you did in this case. The article already linked to the Wikipedia article,
    which you copied and i felt this was sufficient for readers researching the Cyrillic
    script. Please understand that our wiki is still very much in a developmental
    stage, and in some cases, articles serve more as a repository for links to discussions
    on a particular topic and sometimes the actual article content is lacking, but
    even if somewhat inaccurate or incomplete, i usually let this stand in the hopes
    that someone will come along and improve upon the article (or until i have time
    to do that myself!) please continue to help us and welcome to typophile!"

    is in the EU, isn't it a Western country too?  "
