    <BR>Seriously, InDesign is beginning to compete with Quark on a more serious basis
    now, it&#39;s faster than before and I really like the workflow. To bad my printshop
    hates it. <BR> <BR>As for opentype, it&#39;s indeed a promising format, but as
    I find the current slots available in a typeface hard to fill up, opentype will
    not exactly give me less work <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: ' Joe, you&#39;ve asked some really key questions. I think that an argument
    could be made that until Quark supports OpenType features, you won&#39;t see widespread
    adoption -- at least, not in the publishing industry.  <BR> <BR>Publishers are
    pretty much wedded to Quark. InDesign has some attractive features, but nothing
    compelling enough to overcome the inertia. Converting even a small shop over to
    InDesign is a serious proposition and investment, let alone a large established
    design department. <BR> <BR>That said, Quark may have some serious challenges
    if it doesn&#39;t get carbonized soon. As OS X stabilizes and gets more established,
    the fact that Indy runs native may become compelling enough for some operations
    to make the switch, especially if Adobe offers cross-grade pricing comparable
    to a Quark upgrade.  <BR> <BR>If Indy makes inroads, then OpenType will make inroads,
    and Adobe&#39;s gamble will have paid off. Until then, it looks like a crap shoot
    to me. <BR> <BR>-- K. '

  body: ' Stuart, good question. I&#39;m not all that OpenType aware myself yet. ;-&#41;
    But I think there are two levels of OT awareness. I think you&#39;re right, the
    first -- just being able to use OT fonts -- is accomplished by the very nature
    of OS X. In earlier OSes, it can be accomplished with the latest versions of ATM.
    <BR> <BR>But I think the second, more interesting level of OT awareness -- accessing
    the typographic features: automatic ligatures, optical versions, auto true small
    caps, etc. -- requires that the application be written to utilize these features.
    Maybe that&#39;s just Carbon apps, though. It may be that the OS X font panel,
    which I think is used by all Cocoa apps, includes access to all OT features. I&#39;m
    not sure. <BR> <BR>But Quark going straight to Cocoa? -- yeah, right. I&#39;m
    not holding my breath. <BR> <BR>Too bad you won&#39;t be able to come to TypeCon
    this year. I think that Tom Phinney is giving a presentation on OT that should
    prove quite enlightening. <BR> <BR>-- K. '

  body: ' The biggest barrier to widespread adoption of InDesign is not any real advantages
    Quark might have. It&#39;s all the scaffolding put in place over the last decade
    to make Quark work. I would encourage anyone with a newer machine &#40;e.g. capable
    of running OS 10.2 and with at least 512MB of RAM&#41; to grab one copy of InDesign
    &#40;buy it with the Adobe Design Collection for your next new machine&#41; and
    start doing one-machine projects on it, and see how fast it sells itself. <BR>
    <BR>Quark adopting OpenType? Ha, Quark can&#39;t even handle freakin&#39; UNICODE.
    Not even in their hyper-expensive Passport version. ID does multilingual typesetting
    out of the box, but Quark can&#39;t even make use of the simple CE characters
    already found in every Microsoft TT and Apple AAT font. <BR> <BR>Do ease into
    ID slowly, but do prepare to abandon the Quark ship eventually. They&#39;re continuously
    dismissive of any questions regarding intelligent fonts. <BR> <BR>&#40;nota bene:

    font in that you&#39;ve got one font file for both platforms, that really only
    simplifies sales &#40;single downloadable instead of two&#41;. At Adobe we&#39;ve

    I won&#39;t have access to the cool typographic features like auto ligatures,
    swashes, and stuff; but my fear is that since the SC, for instance, is bundled
    in to the OT font and is accessed through OT style swapping, I won&#39;t be able
    to actually access it through the font menu as before. Or what about the optical
    styles of a face like Minion? <BR> <BR>Can you please clarify? What will or won&#39;t

    difficult for anybody to create such a plug-in. So much so that it&#39;s probably
    not feasible. I suspect Quark&#39;s codebase makes some pretty deep-rooted assumptions
    about text handling, and they don&#39;t expose nearly as much of the app to plug-in
    developers as InDesign does, yet doing this in InDesign proved to be quite a bit
    of work. In all likelihood, Quark will need to make some underlying architectural
    changes first. <BR> <BR>If it were feasible, then Adobe probably still wouldn&#39;t
    do it. I mean, why would we put immense work into making our competitor&#39;s
