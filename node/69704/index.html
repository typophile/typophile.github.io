  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'd like to try to soften a little a typeface I'm working on by making its corners round (like those of ShinnType's [[http://shinntype.com/Figgins_Scotch.pdf|Figgins Sans]], for instance).

The obvious way would be to use FontLab's bold effect: first "bold" it by –X%, then bold it by X% making round corners.

Two questions –

First, would you consider the result of such a procedure generally satisfactory? I'm getting the feeling that perfect contours become much less than perfect this way, requiring tedious cleanup, even for relatively small values of X. But maybe I care too much over tiny details that nobody cares about? What would you do?

Second, if I do it this way, then all resulting arcs have the same radius, regardless of the corner's angle. Is it not preferable that greater angles would be replaced by arcs with greater radii, so all would <em>look</em> softened by the same amount?</div>

Sorry, I forget how I did that.
It wasn't a python script, though, just something in the basic FontLab menu.
But I can tell you there was a huge amount of clean-up involved.
A lot of that was because of the "resolution" of 1000 units to the em.
I would probably have been better to work at a much higher resolution.

I'm not sure it is possible to avoid manually finessing the details.
Here is the right terminal of "s" from Figgins, and from AG Rounded.
In both instances, the shapes do not correspond to a simple "circularization" of corners.

What is other people's experience with making rounded fonts?</div>

Executing what algorithm?

@William Berkson, James Puckett and Tim Ahrens 

Thanks for your suggestions, but I'm a PC... :-)

@Nick Shinn 

<cite>I would probably have been better to work at a much higher resolution.</cite>

But then when you turn back to 1000 upm, contours get distorted and you must clean them up all over again. I was under the impression that it was <em>never</em> a good idea to work at a different resolution than the one you'd use for the final product. Was I wrong?

<cite>In both instances, the shapes do not correspond to a simple "circularization" of corners.</cite>

What did dictate its precise shape, then, if any? The eye alone?</div>

You don't have to.
Many TrueType fonts have an em square of 2048.

<em>What did dictate its precise shape, then, if any? The eye alone?</em>

Yes, but I often paste circles into the mask layer, as in the image above, to use as a reference.
When eyeballing the shape of curves, I use the "vertical flip" feature of the FontLab metrics window, which gives a different view; working in fonts that have a contrast of stress between vertical and horizontal, often at an angle, can play tricks on one's eyes, so flipping brings back a measure of objectivity. </div>

As I see it, anything a script can do, I can do too (tedious as it may be). So if I had known what to put in the script, I would have known how to do it myself, which I don't (hence my question).</div>
