  body: "Oh I like the feel this has. The roundness combined with the kinks.\r\nCouple
    of things that come to mind:\r\n\r\nI think the kink in the lower right corner
    of the <strong>b</strong> might have been placed a bit too low. The bowl is being
    'pulled' to the lower right, as if it's being ripped of the stem. The lower curve
    of the <strong>j</strong> is indeed too heavy.\r\n<strong>h/m/n/u</strong>, I
    think the transition from the shoulders (round) to the stems (straights) could
    be a bit more subtle or smooth (a less direct change in direction, if you know
    what I mean).\r\n<strong>p/q/r</strong>, usually the serifs on the side of the
    bowls/ear is a bit longer than the ones on the other side; that way they 'carry'
    the load as it were. Also the ear of the <strong>r</strong> could be a bit too
    long, and might start lower on the stem and extend into a tad more heavy terminal.\r\nThe
    <strong>s</strong> seems to be too light, and also very slightly tips over to
    the right.\r\nThe <strong>t</strong> looks like it could use some love, it looks
    less defined as other characters.  The <strong>z</strong> looks too heavy, but
    it might be ok in text. I don't think the terminal of the <strong>y</strong> fits
    very well in the design, look at those of the 'f' and the 'r'.\r\n\r\nIf you include
    a couple of lines of text in a future sample, people can probably give more contructive
    critique. :) But I hope this helps. I like the characteristics this design has
    alot."

    this seems a bit light for text usage. what are you intending this for primarily?
    it looks great large. i love the broken strokes, they seem to be becoming very

    a. watch your bowls on bdpq: b seems narrow compared to d. c and e seem wide.
    the f seems a bit broken. the counters on the g seem too large with not much breathing
    space in between. i disagree and disagree with Jelmar on hmnu: you should either
    make your joins smoother or more disjointed, i'd opt for more broken. r feels
    a bit weak. s may be a bit too narrow, same with t. the tail of the y feels like
    an unfinished thought and the tail of the j to a lesser extent. the crotches on
    hmnrp feel a bit too shallow, these could be a bit more dynamic.\r\n\r\noverall
    a very nice start! keep up the good work."

  body: Yes, really digging the broken, disjointed strokes. I think that it's more
    effective on letters like "f," where it's a bit more obvious, than in some of
    the places where it's more subtle and could potentially be mistaken for a visible
    anchor point. Basically what Paul is saying, embrace the disjointed aesthetic.
    I think the "y" is really, really beautiful. A superb start! Can we see it in
    text soon?

  body: Darrin, the y is one of the few glaring problems IMO. The tail is out of character
    for the face. One man's trash is another man's treasure I guess. Trash, probably
    too harsh :-) I like the overall impression too. Reminds me of Miguel Hernandez'
    Quetzal on these forums 3-4 years ago.

    we will see more of it, but it won't catch on in a major way or will be of limited
    spread. I think it's an international trend in type design rather than one confined
    to New Zealand.\r\n\r\n@Paul: <em>minutiae: love the a. watch your bowls on bdpq:

    not knock the life out of it before it's had a chance to grow on us. This sort
    of bowl letter width variation is common to many recent (and old) fonts we set
    great store by. The main difference here is that Matt's creation has not succeeded---yet.\r\n\r\n@Randy:
    <em>...the y is one of the few glaring problems IMO. The tail is out of character
    for the face...</em>\r\n\r\nYes. But is that really a problem, or a blessing?
    Is integration of form the be-all and end-all in typeface design? For me integration
    is behind most design decisions when making a face. Other type designers may not
    see it that way and should be encouraged to make their own decisions.\r\n\r\n@Darrin:
    <em>...I think that it\u2019s more effective on letters like \u201Cf,\u201D where

  body: "And in that spirit:\r\n\r\nThis has some traits that are not commonly seen
    and therefore welcome. There is a generous width to certain characters that reminds
    me of Diotima somewhat. Nice! Along with that is a brushy feel that gives a whiff
    of Oz Cooper's hand lettering. Very nice! Long serifs, small eye in a and e, all
    nice, distinctive touches. \r\n\r\nThe spacing needs to be refined; it's uneven,
    but should not be tighter or looser, just more consistent. \r\n\r\nNot sure the
    trendy sharp cuts in the counters are in the right places however. Look at c,
    e, g, s. In s and f especially those cuts are creating a weak spot (as mentioned
    above). \r\n\r\nGiven the other, desirable influences that appear here, consider
    whether the cuts belong at all; or at least reconsider where they are. I am skeptical
    at this point, having seen them everywhere lately. Make sure you know how to use
    them.....\r\n\r\nThere seem to be principles with letter design that make bends
    or sharp angles highly functional in certain places (a, s, c terminals), and very
    distracting in other places. Observe how this affects a typeface's performance
    in reading. It's those distracting bits that mar otherwise good readable faces. "

    before]]. And there is also [[http://www.textaxis.com/img/posters/suse_pos.gif|Suite
    Serif]] on textaxis. And I'm working on a sans for a while now which has the kinks
    too. And I know of another sans which has it, but I can't remember its name and
    I can't locate the bookmark. But it does seem to be somewhat of a popular feature.
    Luckily it's a nice feature! ;)

  body: "The \"kink\"s in this case are the corners, so to speak, on the inside outline
    of a counter, where a node has been placed and the bezier handles are \"broken\".
    \ Oftentimes these kinks are meant to emulate a kind of brush-formed style, or
    else are placed in such a way as to mimic the normal stress/modulation of a pen-formed
    letter. In Weka, you can see it in the c, p, q, s, etc.\r\n\r\nTheir attractiveness,
    I think, comes from the tension they bring to a given form \u2014 continuous curve
    outside, discontinuous curve inside. In this way, (and I don't know if I'm alone
    on this) Ad Lib is sort of a caricature of the style in the same way Bell Gothic
    is a caricature of the concept of the ink trap. "

  body: "Thank you. Well, I entirely agree on the attractiveness brought by them.\r\nOne
    of the earliest examples of such stylizations I have seen (and very good too),
    is in a typeface by Aldo Novarese (which does not exist in digital format).\r\nHe
    married the proportions of Roman inscriptions with the overall feel of a \"drawn\"
    sans-serif.\r\n\r\nI can't see how you could relate Ad Lib to this, anyway. It
    looks to me as informal \"paper-cut\" lettering.\r\nI do not think Bell Gothic
    was meant as a caricature: it was designed by Carter to withstand bad printing
    conditions and the exaggerate look of these features comes from this, right?"

    caricature. I more meant that if you were to ask \"What typeface takes the concept
    of the ink trap to its logical extreme?\" my answer would be Bell Gothic. Similarly,
    if you were to ask me \"What typeface takes the concept of this inner/outer tension
    to its logical extreme?\" the best answer I could give would be Ad Lib (I know,
    it's pretty weak), since, nutty and papercut though it may be, almost all it's
    outsides are curved, and almost all it's insides are optically rectangular. I
    can't think of a typeface that takes this same approach but does it rationally
    or seriously to the hilt. \r\n\r\nWhat was that Novarese face called?"
