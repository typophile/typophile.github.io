body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy new client has Futura Condensed Light as corporate typeface.
  They use it for the body text and some headings. Can anybody recommend a technique
  to emulate this font with a browser-safe font? I was thinking of Arial but I am
  not sure if it's the best solution. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!"

    Inman Flash Replacement)]] for the headlines with the Futura. For body text, i
    guess Trebuchet is the closest option.\r\nBut check for yourself [[http://www.typetester.org/|here.]]\r\n\r\nSeb"

    web embedding. So far, afaik, it is only safari that supports it, with firefox
    coming soon.\r\nYou could try specifying century gothic, as it is a quite common
    win font (85% of windows users, according to <a href=\"http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-WindowsResults.shtml\"><b>this
    survey</b></a>)"

    of web users are still using Internet Explorer 6.0 or later which supports Embedded
    OpenType. So most users would be, in fact, using a browser that supports web embedding. "

  body: "ANY 'light condensed' would likely be a bad choice for body copy text on
    a web page (or on-screen, in general).\r\n\r\nI think light use of the typeface
    via sIFR for headlines is likely the best bet for now."
