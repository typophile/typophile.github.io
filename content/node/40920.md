body: "Here is a predicament that has been bugging me for the past year. I never know
  what to do with a pluralized word that requires [[small caps]]. I have inquired
  within the pages of Elements, Chicago Manual, and a few type books back from school.\r\n\r\nTake
  for instance the words TVs or GMOs. Should they be set like this;\r\n\r\n< sc >
  TV < /sc > s\r\n< sc > GMO < /sc > s\r\n\r\nOr should all the letters be set in
  small caps? My art director says that we should just leave them capitalized (TVs
  GMOs) and ignore the small caps in this instance. I, by nature, push back against
  him. Thoughts, guidelines, rules, opinions \u2026 anything would do. Take care."

  body: This is one reason why small caps should be designed slightly larger than
    the x-height (height of the lowercase 's'). What typeface are you using?

  body: "That always bugged me when I was art directing.\r\nMy solution was to use
    the \r\n< sc > TV < /sc > s\r\nstyle, but bump up the size of the small caps a
    tad, so that there was a noticeable difference from lower-case x-height.\r\n\r\nOccasionally,
    if the face had a larger small cap, that wasn't necessary, so that's the way I
    make my small caps now."

  body: I wouldn't use small caps for something like "TV". Usual practice is to use
    full caps for two or three letters, and small caps for four letters or longer.
    I can't think of any of the latter that would ever be pluralized, with the exception
    of OB/GYNs which I think has been making the move to lowercase lately.

    list, or even in the same text.\r\n\r\nHere's one to add to the sc pile of queries\u2014what
    do you do with a possessive apostrophe in a heading set in sc? My instinct would
    be to drop it down so it optically fit as if the heading was in all caps.  "

  body: Acronyms of more than 3 characters can get really horsey looking and stand
    out too much, which is why I think a lot of mags favor reducing them. But I don't
    think The New Yorker uses true small caps, I believe they just make the acronyms
    a point size or two smaller than the text.

  body: "There are many ways that small caps can work.\r\nA typeface would need at
    least THREE kinds (i.e. three different heights) to satisy them all.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sc_5105.jpg]\r\n\r\n1.
    This is probably the most useful, noticeably taller than lower-case x-height.
    Good for acronyms, and still plenty of size contrast with full caps (unless the
    full capitals are smallish). Also a good size for Cyrillic small caps, where Maxim
    Zhukov has argued that size differentiation from lower case is helpful, given
    the commonality of so many letter forms between the Cyrillic upper and lower case,
    and the few extenders, especially in Russian.\r\n\r\n2. These could be termed
    <em>moyen</em> caps and petite caps. The petite caps are the same height as lower-case
    x-height. Moyen caps would be larger than small caps, to allow sufficient contrast
    with petite caps for setting this kind of titular alphabet soup.\r\n\r\n3. A traditional
    way of setting petite caps, with copious lettespacing.\r\n\r\nA fourth size of
    small caps (b\xE9b\xE9?) might be necessary to deal with \"Mc/Mac\" names that
    are set in all small caps, although this is so infrequent that the typographer
    should best handle it by tweaking, rather than with a separate font. If foundries
    wish to remedy the situation in-font, perhaps just two glyphs, \"Scots A and C
    for small caps\", would do the job.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is ordinals and superiors--occasionally,
    typographers may wish to set these in capital letter style. \r\n\r\nSo, my thinking
    is that the ultimate solution would be to include small caps in the main font,
    and have a separate Caps font, which contains moyen and petite cap sizes at the
    basic upper and lower case keystrokes, and also has superiors that are capital
    in form. \r\n\r\nWith this configuration, the difficult titles (B.Des etc.) could
    be set entirely with the Caps font, simplifying that chore for the typographer.
    Small caps could also be included, so that it would be possible to set both moyen
    caps with petite caps (basic \"upper and lower\" keystrokes) and moyen caps with
    small caps (small caps feature applied), as separate styles.\r\n"

    Atma is pre-OpenType, and has Small Caps = Petite Caps, Mid Caps = Small Caps,
    and Quarter Caps = \"Moyen\" Caps.\r\nPresumably its terminology was adopted prior

    wonder how Atma's various small caps will be implemented in OpenType..."
