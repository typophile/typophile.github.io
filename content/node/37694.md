body: "Hi, I spend much time reading the great articles here, but usually feel hesitant
  to post.\r\n\r\nHowever, I now own a few of the more common commercial fonts, and
  one of the more challenging aspects I have to face at the outset of a project is
  pairing up a body and headline/titling face.\r\n\r\nTo date I tend to stick to using
  a single typeface for both, mainly due to the limited number of fonts I can afford
  as a freelancer. However, things are moving onm and I would like to find something
  to pair up with Cronos, Dax, and the much maligned Myriad Pro... Most of my projects
  are flyers, small brochures, and booklets.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for anyone's
  suggestions of pairings that work for them, and some pairings that look plain awful
  in the eyes of the typogurus...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "I feel in general most pairings depend on the theme or subject of the work.
    \r\n\r\nWhen I think about matching fonts I try and picture a contrast (like a
    body copy font mixed with an italic display) but keep in mind the design aesthetics.
    Maybe the same designer, x-height, time period etc."

    a lot of fun to just go bonkers with weird combinations of eyecatching fonts.
    It works especially well with bright, saturated colors."

    Do what looks good.\r\n2. See Rule #1.\r\n3. Break Rules #1 and #2 as needed.\r\n\r\nEssentially,
    play around and see what you like.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "The fontshop article on type systems is very useful as a guideline - thanks.\r\n\r\nI
    agree, it's usually important (for most clients) to select faces which compliment
    each other in a way that does not subtract the impact that each face has in it's
    own setting. I guess it comes down to my own confidence in choosing two faces
    to work together... \r\n\r\nHaving said that, some of the ideas my clients come
    to me with are pretty horrific (a most recent leaflet had to be set with comic
    sans headlines and arial body type, despite my protestations - this required a
    long walk with the dog to the top of a local hillside and an equally long time
    staring at the setting sun meditating on why the hell I want to be a designer)
    so I doubt I'll go that far wrong!\r\n\r\nI use Dax quite a bit for short runs
    of body text, and would like to use Cronos with it, but I'm not sure if Cronos
    is too Sans to get away with it, although the x-height and basic underlying shape
    wildly different.\r\n\r\nIt's obviously one of those areas that are open to more
    subjective thought than I first imagined :)"
