		<div class="commentbody"> Agree to a degree with Hrant. The money that the big names can command in art is definitely anti-progress. You can buy very good work for a tiny fraction of the work of others. However, are we not slightly biased as a group here, a group which has tended away from the abstract, preferring to stick with what is aesthetic. In that we must acknowledge our slight contempt for a medium that trades on ideas and not necessarily on polished output. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> sure Hrant, calling it &#34;Art&#34; is an easy justification, and belittles any and all discussion, theory or critics opinion, but one must be deemed an &#34;Artist&#34; before you get that title. Before that your merely a painter, sculptor, ect.  <BR> <BR>That is why society has people like Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg, The Guggenheims. By your judgement, anything they&#39;ve ever had to say is worthless when they could have sumed it up with your words. &#34;its art&#34; <BR> <BR>So then, critical as I may be I&#39;m saying its not Art, its nieve. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I have to agree with Hrant. Or maybe when I&#39;m finished I&#39;ll have agreed with Tanya. :$ <BR> <BR>Art in general, and in my opinion &#40;key phrase&#41;, is only the artists until it leaves their studio. Once it is on display the work &#40;whether Cot or Kitsch&#41; becomes that of the viewer. Those who view the work, everyone, will &#34;see&#34; the work through their own life&#39;s experiences. And because of this will like it or not like it based on this. <BR> <BR>Sure there are so-called and so-entitled critics of art who have a following of people that have happened to agree with their &#40;critic&#41; opinions on what is and what is not good art. And that is also not to say that some art isn&#39;t--more or less--obviously &#34;better&#34; art. Some artists do have &#40;and have had&#41; a better understanding of the human figure or how to mix their paints or how to use composition.

		<div class="commentbody"> in general i stick with hrant on this topic. but being a blabber mouth i&#39;d like to add a point: <BR> <BR>there is no real danger in leaving the doors open and letting the meaning of &#39;art&#39; run around our houses, living its stench on everything. Because being easy on this definition will only mean we&#39;ll accept evrything around as a possible oppurtunity for inspiration &#40;or - &#39;Art&#39;&#41;. It does not mean we have to be apathic about everything and let dull and mind-modular objects be excused as art. Each of us has his and hers own free will to see what is insipiring and beautiful, and what is not, so that however we define an object, we could see if its qualities. By opening the meaning of art to the public, instead of closing it in the metal zoo of the critics, we are obligated to see more in everything. Since everything might have artish qualities in it. <BR> <BR>The discussion if something is art or not seems alltogether meaningless to me. &#39;art&#39; is just stuff with concetrated inspiration. if you want, you can discuss those painting as objects and share with people the feelings they evoke in you. </div>
