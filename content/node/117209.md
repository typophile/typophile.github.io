  body: "Gavin - When you post something like this here, it is often helpful to tell
    us the source and, if known, date.\r\n\r\nIn this case, a very old Proctor & Gamble
    product with two O's that are <em>very</em> different makes it clear that this
    was a hand drawn label. No font involved. Ryuk had provided modern alternatives."

  body: "Late 19th or early 20th century artwork in the form of a trademark. The most
    interesting features are the median spurs, the terminals on _S_ and the leg on
    the _R_. \r\nMedian spurs were usually used on Tuscan, i.e. split or fishtail
    terminal fonts, rather than ones with flat terminals. \r\nA font in the latter
    style was digitized by Dan X. Solo under the name Cavalcade.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CavalcadeSoloDoverCircusAlphabetsBookAsIvorySoap_4344.jpg]
    Unfortunately the only legitimate way to get this font is by purchase of a new
    or used copy of \"24 Circus Display Fonts (Dover Electronic Display Fonts) (CD-ROM
    and Book)\" \r\nPrevious discussion of a median spur non-Tuscan font http://typophile.com/node/116784\r\nThe
    trademark could be expanded to make an attractive font, pehraps with plain and
    rimmed variations.\r\nDon"
