body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI work for an eMarketing agency that makes websites for Rare Disease
  Therapies.  I have an assignment to design a \"holiday book\", which will be a small
  (around 5x7) hard red cover book consisting of ~80 pages.  It will contain stories
  from 12 mothers of rare disease patients and the theme of the book is to show what
  good can come out of these disorders.  The artwork will resemble Wallstreet Journals
  \"hedcut\" style.  It's supposed to have a holiday theme, and the art director is
  calling for an old style look with a modern twist to signify that it's coming from
  an internet based company.  The interior pages will be black and white.\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if any typeface ideas come to you fine people from this description?
  \ I am having a hard time picturing what this book will look like.  So, I hope you
  don't mind that I came here looking for some inspiration.  \r\n\r\nThanks."
