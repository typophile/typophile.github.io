  I had the pleasure last night of designing a terrific article about Matthew Carter's
  Yale typeface and the University's overall identity, featuring interviews with Carter,
  Michael Bierut, and others. The article is available here -- http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24465
  -- but the visual aspect of the article on the site is limited. Below I've posted
  today's front page, a close-up of the article on the front, and the graphic I made
  for the inside jump. Critiques are welcome, although at this point obviously it's
  too late to be changed. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0415_pg1_front_5794.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0415_pg1_article_3447.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0415_pg4_grapihc_6656.jpg]"

    is blessed to have Matthew Carter as senior critic for their graphic design program.
    I only wish Harvard had a discernible university-wide graphic identity (other
    than a colour scheme), let alone a classy bespoke typeface.\r\n\r\nGood job overall
    on the design of the article, and I particularly like the drop cap A, a signature
    Yale glyph."

    I can't imagine a better place for me to be.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you liked the drop
    cap; Paul (the reporter) and I discussed starting the article with either an \"A\"
    or \"R\" since those are two of the more distinctive glyphs in Yale.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    And, as a proud Yalie, I have to say that I'm very glad that our identity system
    blows Harvard's out of the water. "

    present in the other examples.. hrm."

  body: Jeff, you probably are referring to our compressed headlines. We use <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/MillerHeadline>Miller
    Headline</a>, which is already condensed, but sometimes we [[squoosh]] the letterforms
    mechanically to 90% or more. But change should be coming sometime soon ...

  body: "My school (Rice) has had a really strong push for a consistent identity in
    the past year or two, but I think we're going about it all wrong. First of all,
    the official university typeface is Trajan, which is not at all distinctive. Anyone
    who is printing a Rice-related publication needs to use the official university
    logo, which is a slightly modified version of \"RICE\" spelled out in Trajan.
    We are not allowed to set the words \"Rice University\" or \"Rice\" in Trajan
    ourselves; we have to use the Illustrator file.\r\n\r\nI like what is said in
    that article about thinking of the typeface as a sort of viral marketing for the
    university; you don't force anyone to use the Yale typeface--you just strongly
    encourage. You essentially make it as easy as possible for anyone on the campus
    to fit the identity system. That's not at all what Rice is doing.\r\n\r\nAlso
    (though this is not related to the Yale typeface at all, and I apologize), someone
    in our Public Affairs department decided that our beautiful 100-year-old crest
    needed to be updated from [[http://www.danablankenhorn.com/images/2007/04/13/rice_shield_sm2.jpg|this]]
    to [[http://registrar.rice.edu/images/seal7.gif|this.]] Apparently we need to
    portray ourselves as an up-and-coming school looking towards the future, as opposed
    to a well-established, nearly-100-year-old institution that is well-respected
    throughout the country, despite the fact that <em>that's what we are.</em> Also,
    the new logo looks terrible when it's printed in grayscale (as most Web 2.0 logos
    are wont to do).\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also, are students allowed to use the typeface for
    their academic work (the license doesn't make it clear enough)? Because if I went
    to Yale, I would totally set every paper I write in that typeface."

    don't even know if there is an official Harvard logo (contrary to what some Hollywood
    films suggest, there is no big sign saying \"Harvard University\" anywhere on
    campus). There's just a university shield with what I assume is custom lettering.
    Typeface-wise, it's a real free-for-all between the different schools, the Board
    of Overseers, different Harvard-related organizations... I do see Minion a lot,
    though. The Graduate School of Design I think has their own attempt at an identity
    system, based on Trade Gothic if I recall correctly.\r\n\r\n<cite>And, as a proud

    a few -- when a slightly compact font is just what you need.\r\n\r\nAs to the
    old school rivalries, I remember when JFK got an honorary degree from Yale. He
    said something like \"Now I have the best: a Harvard education and a Yale degree.\" "

  body: "Eric, you're right; the license agreement is a bit nebulous. I didn't think
    I could use the Yale typeface for school essays, but when I visited the University
    Printer I was told that this is a use they encourage.\r\n\r\nBrian, thanks for
    pointing out the Harvard campus images. I've been starting to catalogue Yale's
    incredible lettering, the early results of which you can see <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/25535730@N03/>here</a>,
    so it's very interesting to see how the two compare. Maybe I'll celebrate our
    inevitable victory at the Game next year by touring Cambridge's lettering in person
    :-)"
