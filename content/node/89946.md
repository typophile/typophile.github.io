  body: "Thanks guys!  Half way home!  \r\n\r\nEliason: I'm worried about that as
    well.  I'm trying to get the information out of the original designers, but who
    knows.  I'm just praying that it is, or praying that I can find something REALLY
    close.  \r\n\r\nCurrently there are T-Shirts with the logo on it.  But if we wanted
    to go beyond that, we're pooched.  Hoping someone knows the Bmore Font!"
