    could, which can be nice. But it isn't necessary?"

  body: "No, it isn't.\r\n\r\nA new font is almost never needed for the creation of
    one, single logo. If an existing font does not meet your or your client's needs,
    it is usually better in terms of time and budget to just create a vector art logo.
    A fount entails so much more work and investment that the few letters or symbols
    found in a logo."

  body: "If you're talking about incorporating letter shapes into a logo design, most
    font licences specifically allow it, and with those that don't it could be argued
    that you can since this is a customary fair use of fonts. (Be careful who you
    argue with, though.)\r\n\r\nNotable exceptions include most dingbat and picture
    fonts, since the glyphs in those fonts are essentially logos already. \r\n\r\nIf
    you have the time and your client has the budget, by all means create a new custom
    font for the project."

    entire typeface, then no. But if you mean drawing only the necessary letters from
    scratch, then I say yes. It is what I always try to do do anyway.\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: "Interesting answers! \r\n\r\nLet's take a simple word and do a test. Say
    you are creating a logo, which will be used first and foremost on stationary and
    eventually a website.Use the word below.\r\n\r\nFruit!\r\nTagline- It's good for
    you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you design those five letter plus punctuation  and the
    tag line by scratch?\r\n\r\nWould you take another font and pop it into a program
    and change it? (Still confused whether that is legal in regards to the EULA- please
    hlep me on this...that is my ultimate question).\r\n\r\nIf you had an existing
    font, would you just polish it up and pop it into a snazzy illustrative design?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Type your word FRUIT! in a bunch of different fonts. You can even do this
    in your font browser. Certain characters and combinations will start to emerge.
    Then customize as necessary. You might decide, for example, to turn the I into
    a banana (I'm going for the obvious here) Wait to tackle the tagline until you
    know where you're going with the logo.\r\n\r\nYou have a lot of questions, have
    you ever studied design? Might be worth taking some classses."

  body: "I would start drawing the letters to get the feel & flavour right. Perhaps
    I already have a typeface in progress that is suitable, perhaps not. I might even
    start straight into FLS, as Illustrator is harder to work the curves. It all depends
    on the budget & client! For instance, <a href=\"http://www.klim.co.nz/content/lettering/kaweka.html\">Kaweka</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.klim.co.nz/content/lettering/conveyIT.html\">conveyIT</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.klim.co.nz/content/lettering/fiend.html\">Fiend</a> all
    started as sketches. Pen and paper are still the easiest ways to nail the idea
    for me!\r\n\r\n\u2014K"
