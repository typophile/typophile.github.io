body: Someone showed me this earlier today. It made me laugh, but at the same time,
  it reminded me of something that I seriously can&#39;t stand. &#40;Which says a
  lot about me.&#41; Anyone else have little things that make them go &#34;ARGH!&#34;?

  body: Is that some sort of confession, Tiffany? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d let people <i>sit</i>
    on my screen, but they&#39;d have to buy me a snazzy new flat one afterwards.
    <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t stand people opening my books too much and damaging the spine.
    I have a guillotine out back for those bastards. <BR> <BR>M.

  body: Matha, <BR> <BR>you&#39;re right! Those books-vandals have no respect for
    anything living under the earth. <BR>And mostly no fine-motorics, dropping books
    whenever they can. <BR> <BR>Michael

  body: Not to mention those bookbinders binding 6000 books an hour for eternity  <BR>-
    provided you NEVER open one of them or take a sharp look on it.

  body: But can you even consider a book to be bound if all of the pages fall out
    as soon as you pick it up? <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Ok, let me work it out and put it the right way: <BR>&#34;binding 6000 books
    an hour&#34; - after the hour: binding gone. <BR> <BR>But it&#39;s worse:  <BR>I
    worked for months in a bindery -  <BR>good and even expensive books bound by hotmelt,
    they will break if you use them.  <BR>Catalogs for fairs and business expositions
    were bound using PUR.  <BR>undestroyable, flexible spine - you could train your
    bizeps opening the book  <BR>over and over &#40;we did!&#41;, it won&#39;t suffer.  <BR>
    <BR>Bad world: good books falling to ashes like mummies  <BR>and dumb catalogs,
    worth only for days, lasting forever. <BR>And this because some cents, I would
    certainly add for a good book. <BR> <BR>Michael'
