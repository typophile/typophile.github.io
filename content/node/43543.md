    Isn't it two-storeyed in Gill Sans? The numeral '1' also looks wrong. \r\n\r\n(Edit:
    Just managed to find a sample of Gill Sans Schoolbook. The 'a' and '1' are indeed
    correct. Posted too soon, apologies)   \r\n\r\n-\r\nArun\r\n-"

  body: "There\u2019s a (custom) font similar to this one: Gill Sans \u201CVolk und
    Wissen\u201D.\r\n\u201CVolk und Wissen\u201D is a German publishing company, specialised
    in educational / school books (as far as I know...).\r\nSorry, couldn't find a
    sample of this font right now though I remember seeing one in \u201CErste Hilfe
    in Typografie\u201D by Hans Peter Willberg and Friedrich Forssmann.\r\nI doubt
    that this font is available for the public. But i might be wrong.\r\n\r\nI think
    the lc a is slightly different, so this is most likely an altered version of the
    original Gill Sans.\r\n\r\n@SuperUltraFabulous: http://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/fyti/typography+for+children.htm\r\n\r\n(e.g.
    AG Schulbuch / Schoolbook wd be another \u201Cinfant font\u201D)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nG\xFCnni
