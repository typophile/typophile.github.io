body: I've started using Chaparral for some of my clients' books but I'm finding it
  condenses lines of type unconscionably, that is unreadably. Has anyone found the
  same thing to be true? Any solutions? A similar but more useful type?

  body: What size are you setting Chaparral in, and which optical size of the typeface
    are you using? Switching to the "Caption" cut might help if you are using it at
    smallish text sizes and finding it a bit tight.
