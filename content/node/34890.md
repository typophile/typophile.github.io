body: A couple of days ago I noticed that <a href="http://typographica.org/"><strong>Typographica</strong></a>
  seems to be back in action. [[Mark Simonson]] has posted <a href="http://typographica.org/001057.php"><strong>an
  update to an article on Phil Martin</strong></a>, and the comments feature is back,
  too. I don't know if this is a portent of more good things to come from Messrs.
  <a href="http://dev.typophile.com/node/12036?">Coles</a> and <a href="http://dev.typophile.com/node/12116">Lurie-Terrell</a>,
  but let's hope so.  :-)
