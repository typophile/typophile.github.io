At Adobe we tested hundreds of OpenType fonts with Quark 4 on OS 9 and had no major issues. <BR> <BR>However, I do recommend examining the OpenType readme, previously pointed at, for known issues with specific apps and the like. There are a few niggly things that you may or may not care about. For example, there was some version of QuarkXPress where &quot;convert to outlines&quot; didn't work on PostScript flavored OpenType fonts. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, here's the word that I got on Avenir NEXT Pro fonts (the OpenType ones, the only ones available on the web site): they will work in Quark 4 on Mac OS 9, but you will only have access the basic 256 character set (just to remind you one more time). No OpenType features will work, as was mentioned above. To be safest, our technicians recommend that you install these fonts directly in the &quot;Fonts&quot; folder in your Mac &quot;System Folder.&quot; <BR> <BR>On a slightly different note, we apparently DO have some PostScript versions of Avenir NEXT floating around the office. They are currently not for sale via the web site, but you still should be able buy them by contacting a Linotype sales representative directly at <a href="mailto:info@linotype.com"><a href="mailto:info@linotype.com">info@linotype.com</a></a> <BR> <BR>However, Dylan, I would <b>not</b> buy those PostScript fonts if I were you. Here's why: the beauty of the OpenType fonts is that small caps and old style figures, as well as the extended character sets for non-western european languages, are all included in one font (i.e., &quot;Regular&quot;). If you wanted all of these in characters in a PostScript font, it would actually be four separate fonts: regular, regular SC, regular OsF, and regular CE.  <BR> <BR>We would of course charge more money for four fonts than for one (but I don't know how much more). Unless I absolutely needed these features right now, I would buy the OpenType fonts. Its gotta be inevitable that your company will eventually upgrade, right? Even the next Quark will be OpenType compliant. Plus, you could probably make your own PostScript extractions from the OpenType font data for your company's use, and still remain within the EULA provisions, as was also discussed above. In short, buying the OpenType weights is an investment in your design future, even though it will sadly cause a few problems in your short run <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0></div>
