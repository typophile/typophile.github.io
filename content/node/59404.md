  am working on a project for a design class and it entails a little research.\r\n\r\nCheck
  out http://evanmade.com/hopefear\r\n\r\nIn order to try to get people to actually
  <em>read</em> the little lead in, I tried to use some interesting typography. This
  was done <em>fairly</em> quickly, so things like grid and measure were not used
  (tisk tisk, i know).\r\n\r\nI would still like a little feedback on the design and
  I would love to have some of you participate with either words, or images/artwork
  (or both).\r\n\r\nSo please check out the project - http://evanmade.com/hopefear"

  body: "I think this is beautiful in a simple way (which usually is the best way,
    in my book). \r\nIt made me smile. In fact it makes me wish I had time to think
    about your questions, and submit something. Of course there's a bunch of detail
    refinements that *could* be done, but for something quick this is really nice.
    \r\n\r\nFWIW, the only thing I'm not crazy about are the arrows. They look very
    Illustrator Default, and kinda clunky and nondescript, especially compared to
    the very cool and obviously informed combination of fonts. They're the Arial of
    arrows so to speak. ;)\r\nThat, and I might try making the secret hint smaller\u2026
    more secret!\r\n\r\nMy $0.02. Now I'm going to hide under my work-laden rock again.\r\n\r\n*\r\nEdit:
    It just occurred to me that maybe this would feel more at home in the Critique
    section?"
