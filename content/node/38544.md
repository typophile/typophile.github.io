body: "Hi! This must be an easy one for you, typoholics, but I'm personnaly totally
  lost. I searched on some font Websites and found nothing. This is a part of the
  Pink Floyd's \xAB A Saucerful of Secrets \xBB album cover. I've seen this type on
  other '70s works... I guess it was very popular by those years.\r\n\r\nPlease help,
  what is it?"
