The countdown timer inside the hatch is using Arial [except for the digit 1, which is in Helvetica], however most everything in the hatch looks like it's from the 70s. So Arial wouldn't have been around yet.

And then there's that Apple II computer. Of course the computer display was done in post, but... why Palatino? Why there?

For some reason, those details bugged me so much I was looking at them frame-by-frame on the TiVo. Anyone care to add anyting to my ramble this morning? :)

Good Idea. Besides, you can't date anything in the hatch against anything else. Hurley and Libby make a comment about the newness of the washer and dryer (This years iconic LG machines must have been product placement) that is kind of a joke addressigng this very thing. Remember MR. Echo's advice, "Don't mistake coincidence fore fate."</div>

FYI, the title at the end is set in Verdana, which seems like a last minute rush thing that stuck. I have always thought it was funny that <em>The Sopranos</em> uses Geneva in the closing credits.</div>

Really? They might have used Arial because they didn't think that ordinary people would notice the anachronism. (But we're not ordinary people, are we?) The Helvetica '1' is quite distinctive, though, so I believe you. I don't see why they'd mix the fonts though. This would take extra effort, which they apparently didn't put into other typographical elements. Unless... unless... it's part of the conspiracy....

When they were cutting an early preview version of the first episode for ABC execs, he did a quick title sequence on his mac (in flash I believe) using futura that was on his mac. When the execs saw it, they loved it and it apparently stuck around for the final version of the show, unchanged.</div>

Hm, looks like the original poster was right. The '1' looks like Helvetica Black but the rest of the numerals (particularly the '2' in the first shot) look like Arial Extra Bold or something. Still a mystery why they'd mix. Maybe they first did it all in Arial, then somebody realized the '1' sucked.

		<div class="commentbody">You can use <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14738">VLC media player</a>* and get around that. I use it to get sshots for my site. It's not 100% easy to pause on the dot, but it works. Also, 'Lost' is available on the Apple iTunes store, so maybe you can capture the image on video from there.

		<div class="commentbody">All my shots were obtained (legally) right from the "Previously On Lost" section of the ABC website at http://abc.go.com/fsp/index.html?channel=Lost

It's actually quite nice quality and they have good 4 minute recaps of the episodes. The only downside is that you can't fast-forward or rewind, just pause, hence the fact that some of my shots are less than optimal.

I asked this because I will be doing some features on type used for television series (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.107404.0.0">Bank Gothic</a> for <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FB.6602.0.0">Clicker</a> for <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/">CSI</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.2961.1.6">FF Confidential</a> for <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/">Alias</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=C.420.0.3">Trajan</a> for <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/">Six Feet Under</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=E.6913.0.0">Democratica</a> for <a href="http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/">Carnivale</a> and so on...), and the articles certainly would benefit from some illustrations.

Anybody has some more suggestions on interesting use of type in television series?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">for a while i stayed fascinated by the show like a sore tooth. i knew it was painfully bad, but i kept checking it out. replete with mixed up pseudo-spiritual iconography, ridiculous plot twists, atrocious acting, and inconsistent character portraits. for a while these questions really bugged me: why didn't the korean characters mention that the dharma logo / taoist trigrams appear on the korean flag ? why doesn't anyone mention that the ultimate number 108 is quasi-magical in some hindu traditions ? why doesn't anyone notice that the infamous doomed numbers 4 8 15 16 23 42 are all streets in new york where A train exits are ?  

then i heard one of the creators interviewed on steven colbert and i got my answer: they were winging it ! making it up as they went along...  lame-o.  it seems the design problems are just part of the same process. "ok, that'll do for now".

but i'm grateful, as that helped me lose interest.</div>
