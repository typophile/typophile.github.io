body: yay! i just noticed on the veer site that [[Jason Walcott]] has done <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000085">his
  own version of Bookman</a>, complete with all the swashies! Too bad there's no [[OpenType]]
  version, tho. :'( I may have to do my own version yet.

  body: I dunno, I'm not sure this is worth celebrating. Does anyone really want to
    use Bookman anymore? I'd rather Jason work on a swashed serif of his own design.

    of the only typefaces we had. It is fun to watch as different typefaces are revived.
    More than book jackets I can't wait for the t-shirts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture

  body: I think it's the file name, Tiff. Your image shares the same name as another
    already in the system. Try renaming your image and then upload again.

  body: Paul... I'm trying to convince Jason to get up to speed on OS X and Fontlab
    so we can start releasing some OpenType Jukebox jigginess. Maybe this year. Fingers
    crossed. Bookman would definitely be one of the first families that I'd pick to
    expand and enhance.

  body: interesting. i just caught wind that [[ITC]] has just released <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2006/Jan2006.htm">Bookman
    in OT format</a>. But i'm afraid ITC Bookman is another creature. I guess you
    can't have your cake...

    ITC Bookman?\r\nI'm actually working with it for a school project and think it's
    pretty neat, and has nice lowercase \"g\"s.\r\n\r\npersonally I think it's unassuming,
    nice to read, and when you look up close it's very pleasant."

  body: I DO like ITC Bookman, but for me it doesn't have the nostalgia that the original
    Bookman does. That just has to do with spice jars in my home kitchen growing up
    and with nothing else. That's all I was saying...
