    good.

  body: "I have to admit that when I have been to Italy this is the kind of logos
    I see all the time. \r\n\r\nGranted it usually for a Mall or a Car Dealership
    or a Museum Shop - or on a magazine that is about to go belly up to be replaced
    by another similar one not for a country. But this logo comes from a pre-existing
    long standing ( 15 years+ ) context. So What I am saying is - in a weird way it
    does fit. Maybe you do't like that aspect of the itallian reality but.... it's
    there.\r\n\r\nWhat I see in it that nobody else seems to see is a willingness
    to be less serious that the UK & The US don't have. Is that bad or good? I have
    no idea. Is the logo itself wonderful? To me - No. But the key question to ask
    is - is this going to last more that a year & how serious is it as an issue anyway.
    I bet it last only a year & that it is therefore totally un-serious as an issue."
