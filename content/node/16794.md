  body: Perhaps this refers to someone named "Thall", who likes other people's money.
    After all, if it was "Thou", it should be either "thy" or "thine". And "cheque",
    come to think of it.

    that's why he's getting your pay check and not ashamed about it.

  body: "I have to admit to using Google to research a spelling as it's sometimes
    a faster starting place than the dictionary (especially when digital dictionaries
    return <em>nothing</em>). For example, search for \"ven diagram\" and you get
    18,000 results. Then if you search the correct spelling, \"Venn diagram\" you
    get 558,000 results. I'm sure it's not 100% reliable, but it's good when you don't
    have a clue.\r\n\r\nIt's like polling the audience in Who Wants to be a Millionaire.
    =P\r\n\r\n\"thou shalt not\" yields 1.2 million results\r\n\"thall shalt not\"
    yields 558 results\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nLest anyone think I'm an AIGA basher
    (nay, I'm a paying member, else why would I receive their mailings) I should say
    that the AIGA deserves a lot of credit. Who else could be a non-profit and maintain
    the image they've created with the budgets they have. Seriously."

    I didn't really think of this post as anti-AIGA-ism. Seriously, who doesn't enjoy
    pointing out someone else's mistakes? :)\r\n\r\nTo put my own shameful moment
    into the ring: \r\nOn a big marketing kit project, I once misspelled part of the
    client's name on the kit label. Fortunately, a co-worker caught the mistake (AFTER
    they were printed, but BEFORE they were applied) and we were able to fix it.\r\n\r\nBut
    believe me, it took a LONG time to live down the 'Infastucture' incident. "

    My colleague designed a poster reading "ARCHITECURE". Which was a typo, but the
    kind of typo you can claim was purposeful.
