    stands for \"Country Bluegrass Blues and Other Music For Uplifting Gormandizers\".
    Gormandizer usually means a ravenous eater of food, but according to Kristal here
    it means \"a voracious eater of ... music\".')"

    music there, usually punk, ska, rockabilly, something much harder and edgier.\r\n\r\nI'll
