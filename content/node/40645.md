  assistant\u2014with her r\xE9sum\xE9, and I\u2019m not sure how best to display
  the list of her rotations.\u2002A three column layout (medical subfield, place of
  work, date) is easy, if dull; not left-aligning every blessed field looks better
  but may not be as readable\u2014I\u2019ve playing with the thing too long to say
  for sure.\r\n\u2003Which form looks and reads best?\u2002Is there an alternative
  I\u2019m missing and should be trying?\r\n\u2003Thanks,\r\n\u2014Joel"
