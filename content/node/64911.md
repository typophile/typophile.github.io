body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm putting together a list of type styles which can be thought
  of as defining particular eras. It's for an etymological English dictionary project:
  every word set in type/lettering contemporary with when the word was first used.
  Since the Latin alphabet is first used in around 600BC, this is as far back as the
  list goes.\r\nPreferably I'd like to use examples from the English-speaking world
  where possible.\r\nI thought I'd put my list out there for your comments, improvements,
  suggestions, edification, that sort of thing.\r\n2000+: FF Dax\r\n1950 - 2000: Helvetica\r\n1900
  - 1950: Futura (Architype Renner)\r\n1800 - 1900: Clarendon (Adobe)\r\n1700 - 1800:
  Baskerville (Berthold)\r\n1500 - 1700: Fell types (HF&J)\r\n1200 - 1500: Blackletter
  textura (HF&J)\r\n800 - 1200: Carolingian minuscule (Canada Type Luminari) \r\n500
  - 700: Half uncial (Linotype Neue Hammer Unziale)\r\n300 - 500: Uncial (Linotype
  Omnia)\r\n100 - 300: Classical Roman Lapidary (Trajan)\r\n-100 - 100: Early Roman
  Lapidary (Lithos / Herculanum)\r\n-400 - -100: Early Greek Lapidary (Any ideas?
  For an example see http://www.textism.com/writing/?id=2)\r\n\r\nThis list comes
  partly from:\r\nhttp://www.designhistory.org/handwriting.html\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\nH"

  body: I've made a font "Pannartz", based on the first (so it's concidered) antiqua
    type style, Sweinheim & Pannartz; from 1468.
