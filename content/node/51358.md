  out. It looks like some sort of Futura/ avant garde mix up.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v328/bobbykills/Picture4.png\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great, Im just curios as to whether its a font or its simply drawn
  in illustrator.\r\n\r\nCheeeers,\r\n\r\nBobby"

    modify the A like that and also to trim the leg of the L. To me the Avant Garde
    identity is keyed by the C with the horizontal terminals.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes the C is a dead giveaway, but the S is too similar to futura also.\r\n\r\nMight
    try recreate it to shed some light on the subject.\r\n\r\nBobby"
