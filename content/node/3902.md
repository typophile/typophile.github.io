  body: FontLab 4.5 for the Mac was just released yesterday. <A HREF="http://www.pyrus.com/downloads/FL45MacDemo.hqx"
    TARGET="_top">Grab the latest demo.</A> It runs on OS X and costs only $200 if
    you&#39;re a registered Fog user. The trial version runs fully featured for three
    days, so find three consecutive days you can set aside for testing before you
    install it. Mind you, the trial version of ScanFont made me decide to buy after
    just one day. <BR> <BR>This software is a total dream. The Python integration
    will make it even more extensible. I have a number of scripts for it already,
    and a few big commercial Python add-ons in the works. <BR> <BR>You need Mac OS
    9.1 or later for the latest version. You can also run it on Windows, though I
    recommend either Win2000 or Win XP Pro. Good luck, and I hope it works for you.

    in certain ways &#40;not sure how though&#41;, I assume to move out of the way
