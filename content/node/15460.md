body: I am redesigning a fashion magazine where the display faces are Didone/Moderne.
  For a while I was considering Melior as a body face but it's simply too limited
  (not Open Type, not enough weights, OSF etc.) I fell in love with Storm's Walbaum
  Text but as I'm setting it, the color starts to appear very dark, almost inelegant,
  on the page. I'm worried about going so counter-trend as most consumer mags are
  light. Can anyone think of a similar face with lighter color?

    by the full text set in it. You might try something that will open the page up
    a little more.\r\n"

  body: "Walbaum is great for text setting. It has been used for such in Germany for
    over 150 years. Stateside, WIRED magazine uses (used?) a customized version of
    it, made by Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can lighten up the text by adding
    more leading? Or you could try another Walbaum digitization, like <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1594/walbaum-family.html\">Linotype's</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/walbaum-mt/\">Monotype's</a> (Monotype's
    certainly looks light\u2014from the preview\u2014to me; maybe it'd work?)."

  body: "I was redesigning a magazine a few years ago, and I worked up some prototypes
    using several different text and display faces. When I showed them to the client,
    he said he didn't want to discuss them with me for a few days, but instead would
    take the boards with him and get back to me. I asked why he didn't want to at
    least give me some preliminary thoughts, and he said, \"I want to take them to
    my mother and have her read through them. She's 70. If she can't read it, it's
    no good to me.\"\r\nI'll never forget that response, because it was so honest
    and so practical.\r\nWalbaum has been used for a hundred years (I suppose it's
    closer to 200), and it's a beautiful face. But I'd work up some dummies with something
    more legible, such as Perpetua (with a good amount of leading) or even Palatino,
    just to compare. I don't know. You said you were looking for suggestions."

  body: You know what- I don't know how but I must have missed your mention of the
    Display being Didone Moderne. Walbaum might work if you bumped the pt by a half
    or so and increased the leading, although its real strength, in my opinion, is
    as a headline face.

  body: "FF Acanthus is lovely, although not Opentype\u2014and if Storm's Walbaum
    is too dark for you, you'd probably find the text weight of Acanthus too dark
    as well. \r\n\r\nOurType's Arnhem Blonde is another great face, and it is Opentype.\r\n\r\nAdobe's
    Kepler is mighty useful, and very full featured. It would be hard to go wrong
    with it.\r\n\r\nDTL's Paradox is pretty cool. I believe all the DTL faces are
    now supplied in OT.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Not a Waldbaum, but a modern that has been used by several magazines. And it is
    OpenType.

    body: Excellent feedback everyone. Thanks very much. At first blush, Alfon has
      all the right features (I wish it had a closed loop 'g'.) I will definitely
      consider it.

    to its present form. (through many alternates) Changing that character does change
    the entire feel of the face, so I'd rather not go there. If you absolutely feel
    Alfon works for your project, drop me a line about a custom version, but first
    I'd try it \"as is\". It really works well as magazine text.\r\n\r\nHaving spent
    the first 12 or so years of my career in magazines, I keep the needs of magazine
    AD's in my head whenever I design a type family.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Showing them would require me to still have them. I tend to discard glyph
    variations once I settle on what I decide is the final. Sometimes they live on
    in another design, but a cascade of 12 or 15 variations of a lowercase g tend
    to either be discarded, or filed away never to be found. Just as well, the closed
    bowl g I would draw today as an alternate would most likely be  very different
    than the one I drew 2 or 3 years ago.\r\nI know that some designers tend to save
    everything, but I'm usually pretty liberal with the delete key."
