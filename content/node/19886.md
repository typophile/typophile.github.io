  of Fontalicious. I love both of these designers work but their websites are dead...
  I emailed T26 to see if Ben was still alive but no response yet.  I have a feeling
  the same for Thierry.\r\n\r\nAny info would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/presencetypo/\">MyFonts</a>. \r\n\r\nBen
    is an open question. It looks to me like his fontalicious.com has been coopted
    by some ne'er-do-wells."

      not his witty commentary. Or even an e-mail address to send bikini pics.
