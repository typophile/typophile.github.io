[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5854.jpg]
Right before the Arts and Crafts movement was the Victorian age which occurred 
during Queen Victoria’s reign in England. First looking at the Graphic Design 
examples during this time, I was unsure of how I felt about how many graphic 
elements the designers used on posters and ads. Visually it seemed that everything 
but the kitchen sink was in a single ad. The layouts were symmetrical in form with 
many added decorative elements. Standards of mass produced items were lower and the need for quantity surpassed quality in a lot of instances. However, I feel 
as if this syle has influenced recent designers that have incorporated typefaces and 
layouts from the Victorian era.</p>

<strong>Arts and Crafts 1850-1910</strong>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artsandcraft_4334.jpg]
Tired of the cheap mass production of the Industrial Revolution, John Ruskin and 
William Morris sought to bring individual craftsmanship back to design.  Morris, 
unhappy with the quality of home furnishing being sold at the time, designed his 
own wallpaper, tapestries, and furniture. Morris drew inspiration from nature to 
design his elaborate layouts. He even produced his own typefaces. I personally love 
the patterns from this time period, and even though Morris’ layouts utilized very 
little negatives space I really find some of his book designs to be works of art.

<strong>Swiss Style 1920-1965</strong>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/269418230_8a7ee945f8_3776.jpg]
Swiss Style was my first love. I really appreciated the clean and uncluttered lay-
outs that incorporated a lot of negative space. This time period produced the re- volutionary typefaces such as Univers and Helvetica. The designers during this time period incorporated a geometrical grid to layout text and graphics. The simple 
layouts help create dramatic posters during this time period.
