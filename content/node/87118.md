  been using FontStruct for a while. I'd like to move on to non-modular typography
  but I'm not sure which font maker to buy. Should I use FontLab, FontCreator, or
  FontForge? Or is there an even better one?\r\n\r\nSome requirements are:\r\nOpenType
  ligature support\r\nAnti-aliasing /supersampling options (not necessarily ClearType)\r\nFULL
  Unicode support, including private use\r\n\r\nSome things I'd like:\r\nMacros for
  adding diacritical marks, super/subscript, &c.\r\nAbility to export to SVG\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ntruth14ful\r\n\r\nPS:
  I have tried making a few glyphs in SVG, but it was very slow and not visual in
  any way. I'd like a program that doesn't require this."

    pro\u2019s use FontLab Studio. Or the reborn Fontographer. Interesting newcomer
    is Glyphs."

  body: "IIRC, there are two paths from [OT]TF to SVG: [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/|FontForge]]
    and [[http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/|Batik]]. I think [[http://www.inkscape.org/|Inkscape]]
    has SVG as its native format. Some folk like to draw their glyphs in Inkscape
    and then pull them into FontForge.\r\n\r\nSeems to me that lots of folk here swear
    by FontLab. Or at it. Sometimes even both."

    some leading type designers seem to be using now. See http://typophile.com/node/85575

  body: Can FontForge do what I need (OpenType ligatures, supersampling, private use)?
    If so, I'd like to use that, just because it's free. How about FontLab? Can it
    do those things?

  body: "AFAIK, all those mentioned can do OT ligatures (and other features) and the
    PUA in their sleep. The PUA is just a range, after all. Same with the GASP table
    (which lists at which pixel size ranges the MSWindows renderer should apply hinting
    or smoothing (anti-aliasing)).\r\n\r\nWare, FontForge is not install-and-go. There
    is at least one pre-packaged Windows version, I think, mentioned elsewhere on
    Typophile, but its primary distro is source-only. Makes sense, since its target
    is Unix/Linux machines, and these vary a lot.\r\n\r\nCan't tell you how FF feels
    in use, since I never compiled X on my LinuxFromScratch5.* box and can thus only
    run it in scripting mode.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Python programmer or hacker, FontLab
    and FontForge will both integrate with Python.\r\n\r\nRemember, the payware font
    editors do come with explicit support, possibly some hand-holding as well."

    handling in Glyphs is the best I\u2019ve seen so far since it makes extensive
    use of anchors. Glyphs also has a few options for realtime manipulation of multiple
    glyphs. Plus, just like Fontlab and Robofont, it has a Python interface, so you
    could write your own macros.\r\n\r\nExporting to SVG? Use Fontforge."
