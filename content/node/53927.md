    Sorry about the small samples: I was thinking it might be best to judge this at
    its intended size (it's going to be used on screen long before anything else).\r\n\r\nHrant,
    I did quite a bit of \"playing around\" with those words earlier in this project;
    a scrabble/crossword idea was in there. The client ended up being happiest with
    this \"plain & simple\" solution, which also fits the assignment pretty well.\r\nThe
    web site is trying to be \"serious\", but to avoid being boring; there is a little
    bit of a barely perceptible, and unexpected, twist built in, but that is going
    to happen outside of the type (in the grid)."

    OK then.\r\nFor the sake of time I will deal with whole pixels only.  :-)\r\n\r\n-
    Take the top line one pixel right.\r\n- Bring the bottom line one pixel lower.\r\n-
    I'd make the \"LTE\" one pixel tighter.\r\nThe rest looks fine to me.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n-
    For the vertical stems, make the edges that are anti-aliased (like on the left
    of the first \"L\") solid black.\r\n- The anti-aliasing, especially on the diagonals,
    seems strange; did you do a Curves on one of the earlier dark-gray versions?\r\n-
    The \"M\"s are clearly too dark.\r\n- The \"W\" and the \"A\"s are a hair too
    dark as well.\r\n- I'd make the \"L\"s narrower.\r\n- Lower the bar of the \"A\"s.\r\n-

  body: "Oh wow, this is major work coming up.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-|  Thanks everyone! (No,
    I <em>mean</em> that.)\r\n\r\nI was hoping I wouldn't have to do so much to the
    letterforms themselves, but looking at this from a type design (instead of a logo
    design) perspective, I'll have \r\nto agree with all of your points, Hrant.\r\n(For
    the record, I have already made the \"S\" quite a bit taller, and rotated it,
    and tweaked the curves. \"Deflated\" was a very apt description, Justin.)\r\n\r\nHrant,
    no weird Photoshop action on that anti-aliasing. Those are basically screenshots
    from AI (hit me if that's a bad thing to do). I did however make it black this
    time instead of the final dark gray, since I figured that may make it easier to
    judge the \"pure\" shapes.\r\n\r\nJan/paragraph: That's a big dilemma with the
    \"W\"/\"M\" alignment. I tried visually aligning the counters (it's tempting),
    but I felt it made the whole alignment feel \r\na bit wacky. (Also, this will
    appear basically as left-aligned on the web site, and I'd like to keep it from
    looking <em>too</em> \"designed\" &ndash; if that makes any sense.)\r\n\r\nPeter,
    I guess that's subjective, but your version feels a bit \"constipated\" to me
    \r\n(no offense &ndash; that's the word/feeling that sprung to mind!). Also, this
    doesn't really need to pack such a visual \"punch\" \u2013 it may appear to be
    \"normal text\" more or less.\r\nBut, thanks for the compliment \u2013 I confess
    to be serious about spelling (as far as my command of English permits).\r\n\r\nCheers!
    Will get back with an updated version soon."

    There's an inevitable variation within the pattern, of course.\r\nBut I completely
    stand by the spacing here, within the limits of the few moments taken to produce
    this...\r\n\r\nPerhaps \"constipated\" ;-), but my sense of these strong letters
    themselves is that they want to form a close association.\r\nToo much inter-letter
    space creates vertical rivers. Porous, rather than unified.\r\n\r\nIt's about
    texture here, and IMHO, don't think the pattern is wrong in the least.\r\n\r\nTouch\xE9

    highly dependent on context and concept. There isn't one \"right\" version & everything

    have visual appeal, (a) doesn't fit the concept/context/client/application/idea,
    and (b) also isn't my style. (By which I don't mean to imply some artistic conceit,
    but am trying to say I wouldn't do it that way, and it also doesn't look good
    to me \u2013 which comes back to the subjective nature of this.)\r\n\r\nFor the

    I also have my fancy Command-Alt-Control-8 key combo that inverts the screen,
    which is also quite handy. But yeah, I'll put this stuff up on my wall and, like
