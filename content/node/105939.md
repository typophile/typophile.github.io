    image and some creative photoshop? Any \"close\" fonts would likely not be good
    enough, anyway.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\nXervice\r\n\r\nEdit\r\nSorry, \"likely not
    good enough\" is assuming that, since it's hand carved, it might be based on art
    instead of an existing font."

    the <strong>P</strong>, the <strong>E</strong>, and the lower-right stroke of
    the <strong>K</strong>, and then stretch the whole thing horizontally, you'll
    be pretty close.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bridge_6704.jpg]"
