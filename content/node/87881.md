  only a single sentence about it that I could find in the FontLab manual.\r\nI asked
  some folks at Adobe about this and, since they use tools developed in-house, they
  had no clue - not even an educated guess about what these settings do.\r\n\r\nIn
  FontLab's Hinting Settings:\r\n\r\n-&emsp;Standard Stems (T1 hinting)\r\n-&emsp;Additional
  hinting parameters\r\n\r\nThis next one is the mystery:\r\n\r\n&emsp;-&emsp;T1 Autohinting\r\n\r\n(Gif
  image attached to this post and posted here, too: <a href=\"http://readableweb.com/rb/hintsettings/type-1-settings.gif\">Type
  1 Settings - FontLab</a>\r\n\r\nIt has one row for 'Horizontal' and another row
  for 'Vertical', with fields for:\r\n\r\n'MinWidth', 'MaxWidth', 'MinLength', and
  'Aspect Ratio'\r\n\r\nTwardoch, anybody?  What do these settings do?\r\n\r\nI'm
  no stranger to trial-and-error experimentation, but a clue would be nice.\r\nBesides,
  it's odd that there's nothing specific about it in the manual.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nRich\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    obviously you've explained it to yourself since it's pretty self-explanatory.\r\nMaybe
    I'm stupid. Would you mind sharing it's meaning with me?\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious
    to the head of the Adobe type group, I can't know for sure but I think he'd be
    amused by the notion that you're a step ahead of him. Ted Harrison of FontLab
    doesn't know either. The manuals for both the current and previous version of
    FontLab say little more than it exists. Not what it does or what the values control.\r\n\r\n@t&eacute;\r\nThere
    are no books on T1 hinting. If you know of any, I'm all ears. What tutorials and
    references there are don't give any clue as to what these values control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Since Type 1 hinting is applied to stems, I'd assume these options control
    how FontLab identifies stems to be hinted. Features which are smaller than minWidth,
    larger than MaxWidth, or shorter than MinLength won't be treated as stems and
    thus will not be hinted. Features which fall within these parameters but which
    are outside of the stated aspect ratio presumably also won't be hinted.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "I'm not sure how 'Aspect Ratio' applies, so generally leave that at default.
    The others are fairly self-explanatory. Each is a setting that determines what
    the FL autohinter will treat as a stem for hinting purposes.\r\n\r\nMinWidth and
    MaxWidth respectively determine the narrowest and widest stems that will be hinted.
    Note that these are in absolute units per em, so if your font has a UPM of 2048,
    for instance, you'll likely want different values in here than if the font has
    a UPM of 1000.\r\n\r\nMinLength is the length of *straight* stem that will be
    hinted, so might be set to ignore very short segments. Note that the autohinter
    seems not apply this to curves, which are hinted or not based only on MinWidth
    and MaxWidth settings.\r\n\r\nIn general, you want to set these values on a per
    font basis -- which is why the settings are part of Font Info and not an FLS options
    setting -- because they should reflect typical stem values in the font. You do
    not want to set the MaxWidth too large, because otherwise you will generate a
    lot of overlapping hints as FontLab. Obviously you want your MinWidth to be small
    enough to capture the thinnest stems that you want to be hinted, so in the case
    of a Light or UltraLight font this value will need to be small.\r\n"

    will come back in a couple of hours to digest. I might have a question or two,
    if you'd be so kind as to provide clarification.\r\n\r\n\"Aspect Ratio\" seems,
    so far, to be a total mystery to everybody I've asked.\r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch in

    found that these settings are \"sticky\". Once changed, they stay changed for

    a bit. Thanks for the Blues Clues.\r\n\r\nrich "
