  would anyone kindly be able to offer some insight into the method of drawing this

    created by his staff, which was mostly animators, so they probably used the same
    brushes they used in their work. (Or it was drawn to resemble that look.) \r\n\r\nI
    agree with the comment about infringement. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disney_5869_4141.jpg]"

    \u2013 it'll mostly be a personal project. \r\n\r\nI can't tell what kind of brush
    it is though, would it be something that's flat, slanted or pointy? It looks inconsistent
    to me \u2013 granted I have little experience with brushes."

  body: "> it'll mostly be a personal project\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean you're okay.
    I used to be involved with a gaming fan site (not Disney) and the game company
    had strict rules about what fans could legally post. Companies don't like to offend
    fans but they need to protect their assets.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that Disney has
    posted somewhere their rules regarding fan use of their images, copycat fonts,
    etc. Also some fan sites may have discussions of what Disney allows. \r\n\r\n"
