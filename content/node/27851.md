  typeface. \r\n1) Would you say it might be, or SHOULDN'T (as it was initialy drawn
  for the screen)?\r\n2) Could you help me understand what this means: \"His Verdana
  and Tahoma families were designed for the screen and EXTENSIVELY HINTED; they sacrifice
  economy for readability, A SENSIBLE DECISION WHEN SCROLLING IS CHEAP BUT PIXELS
  ARE SCARCE.\" (found on the typowiki)\r\n\u2026does this simply means that it is
  not apropriate for printed matters (specialy in big size)?\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  opinions,\r\nClaire"

  body: Claire, I think that Verdana is quite appropriate for headlines online. However,
    I wouldn't recommend it for use in print.

    defined in their graphic guidelines (or whatever you call it...). Even their logo
    is based on Verdana. I suppose the idea was to use a font that the customer would
    have and also they have quite a lot of stuff on the internet.\r\n\r\nI'm quite
    used to it by now, but not enjoying it.\r\n\r\nNo, I didn't design the logo etc."

  body: "Thanks for your answer Dan. \r\nI like to use Verdana for the web, but for
    printed matters, I would better not use a font that was made initially for the
    screen. In the meanwhile, I thought I should maybe just trust more Matthew Carter's
    hand, although I don't really like the look of some letters in a display text\u2026\r\n\r\nYou
    might be able to explain me what \"extensively hinted\" gives as a consequense.
    'cause I don't know so much about font encoding, and it's effects. Does it means
    : \"it is finely drawn in the closest details\" or \"the encoding is very complicate,
    which makes of it a huge and heavy font\"?\r\n\r\nClaire"

  body: "Actually, it was designed for both screen and print. Although the demands
    of the screen came first, the outlines and metrics that appear when the face is
    used in print are modified to suit that medium. And it even has kerning!\r\nDIN
    and Interstate were designed for signage, and that hasn't stopped their widespread
    use in print. What they have in common is origins in media with much cruder horizontal
    spacing than printing type.\r\n\r\nVerdana has not become established as a print
    face partly because of the screen myth, but mainly because of its limited family.
    Heck, a Light would be useful even to web designers :-)\r\nExtra Bold, Light,
    and Condensed variants would help establish Verdana for display use.\r\nIt's been
    50 years since Univers, designers expect a new face to have a bit of a palette.\r\n\r\nAscender
    Corporation has -- up to now -- missed the opportunity; meanwhile Interstate is
    available in evrything from Hairline to Ultra Black. Emigre's Base, of similar
    design provenance as Verdana, also has a big family and is well established in
    print."

  body: 'I agree with Nick, I was hoping that Ascender would have made a few intermediate
    weights by now - a semibold and a light would be well received by the design community
    in my opinion. Anyhow If the spacing of Verdana is too wide you could try Tahoma,
    essentially the same design with narrower spacing. Also Nina a condensed version
    of Verdana especially for small screen devices. Both available from Ascender. '
