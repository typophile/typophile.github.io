body: Hi All, <BR> <BR>This is my first post. I am writing my Mathematics Ph.D. thesis.
  I am planning to use Classical Garamond to typeset the thesis. Usually people use
  Computer Modern &#40;that comes with LaTeX typesetting program&#41; or Times New
  Roman. Garamond is artistic and that is my choice as I want a relaxed look for my
  thesis. Also, I own it so would not have to spend extra money. If it is the right
  choice, what font you would choose for headers, a sans serif font or bold weight
  of Garamond? Thank you very much in advance for your time and help.  <BR> <BR>Rahul.

  body: I agree with Tiffany. I&#39;m not a big fan of Garamond&#39;s bold weight.
    However, I have more experience with Adobe Garamond than Classical. <BR> <BR>Tiffany,
    since I don&#39;t know, do you think that Classical Garamond and Adobe Garamond
    SC can mesh? <BR> <BR>Rahul, I applaud your desire to seek out something better.
    Back in college I used to use Centaur with non-default margins and line-spacing
    because TNR in Word settings was so painful. Professors would ask me how I made
    my papers so nice to read. The typography was sketchy, but even those adjustments
    made a big difference. <BR> <BR>My experience with Garamond is that it can get
    tricky at smaller sizes because of its proportions and relatively fragile forms
    &#40;as compared to TNR, which was designed to take abuse&#41;. This may not matter
    for what you&#39;re using it for, but be conscious of that, particularly if you&#39;re
    outputting on an inkjet or lower-res printer &#40;which I was often forced to
    do&#41;. <BR> <BR>Because I&#39;m not a mathematician or a LaTeX user, I&#39;d
    like to know what you&#39;re using for setting the equations. Are you going with
    Garamond, or a more specialized mathematics face?

  body: Nice that you&#39;re looking beyond your default choices. Garamond &#40;which
    cut?&#41; will work well as long as your point size isn&#39;t too small &#40;unless
    you&#39;re using the obese ITC Garamond, in which case I can&#39;t help you :-&#41;.
    As for the headers, I&#39;d recommend smallcaps too &#40;you need a separate font
    though, don&#39;t use any automatic smallcaps method - they create discord&#41;
    - not a bold weight of Garamond - those tend to look caricaturish. If you go for
    a sans, I&#39;ve had good results pairing Garamond with Bank Gothic &#40;a pretty
    ubiquitous font too&#41;, which might be especially good in your case since it&#39;s
    math stuff. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Oops. I must have glossed over when I read the word &#34;classical&#34;. Well,
    I guess you might not have Adobe Garamond smallcaps then. :^/ But, I stand by
    my suggestion. Margins ... I agree with the wide margins. I am fond of 2.5&#34;
    on the left and 1&#34; on the remaining three. But, you might not have a choice.
    Some schools give students set guidelines, I know I always gave my students set
    guidlines. Yeah, I am mean, but when students realized they could use certain
    typefaces to fill the pages quicker, well I had to stop that! ;^D <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t
    go with a sans, because this will be deeply read anyway. I would think the reason
    to use a sans is to let someone skim through it. Well, I guess you can&#39;t keep
    people from skimming. Anyway, if you will be using Eular &#40;if I&#39;m understanding
    it correctly&#41; that will serve as contrast enough where you probably won&#39;t
    want a sans at all. <BR> <BR>I would agree with Hrant on the point size. 10 pt

    29&#41;. After reading Bringhurst, I found in experimenting that the measure is
    indeed very important to comfort level in reading continuous text. If you are
    close in width to a 66 character line &#40;Bringhurst explains how to measure
    this using his table&#41;, it really is a big benefit.  <BR> <BR>On A4 paper,
    a usual full width line is way too wide for comfort. With the narrower measure,
    you can use the margins for titles and notes, if your type setting software permits.
    <BR> <BR>The other thing that is critical is the leading. Adjust it till you find

    text is typeset in Classical Garamond and Mathematics is typeset in Euler and
    Computer Modern font, although the numbers are typeset using old style figures
    from text font. I have set the text at 11/13.6pt. The text width is 312pt and
    height is approx. 514pt. Spine and edge margins are 98pt and 158pt, respectively.
    Upper and lower margins are 130pt and 200pt, respectively. I use the ratio 1:1.618
    to divide the margins after fixing the text width and text height, they also share
    the same ratio. Please have a look at the file and give your opinion. I have a
    question, do old style figures look good in chapter title and heading?  <BR> <BR>Thank

    that have been historically tried for page and text blocks, and their positioning
    on the page. Not rules, but fascinating, especially for a mathematian, I would
    think. For example, he shows you how to put a golden rectangle text block on an
    A4 page, with a lot of white space around it, which will work great for you. <BR>
    <BR>Your running head with the rule defines the text block as wider. The outside

    or make the rule shorter, and reposition the whole thing. I don&#39;t know the
    current size of your type, but you can certainly make it bigger &#40;not much
    bigger though&#41; if you like, as you will use the space better.  <BR> <BR>Bringhurst&#39;s
    book is an example of how to use margins. His way is traditional. It has been
    revived in many computer instruction books, which have wide pages with stuff in
    the wide margins. Basically you want an additional column outside the text block,
    with enough space between it and the text block to distinguish it, but not so
    much that it&#39;s not related. Then do the numbers or notes right aligned on
    the left page and left aligned on the right page, if you have a wide outside margin.
    You can just align the numbers with the head, sub head or first line of the equation.   '

    topic for me, although I&#39;m in my first year now so I&#39;m not actually writing
    up yet! Apart from the thorny issue of mathematical typesetting, one has to contend
    with restrictive and largely arbitrary layout regulations. <BR> <BR>For example,
    my university mandates 12 pt text, with &#34;double or 1.5 spacing&#34; &#40;which
    I suppoose means 12/18 at least&#41;. It must be printed recto only on A4 paper
    with all margins at least 15mm, and the left-hand &#40;binding&#41; margin 40mm
    or more. <BR> <BR>For my <a href="http://www.ma.man.ac.uk/~rhouston/msc.pdf">master&#39;s
    thesis</a>, I used 12 pt Charter and Euler with a measure of 29 picas &#40;to
    make a &#34;double square&#34; text block, as Bringhurst would have it&#41;. I&#39;m
    sure there must be a better solution than this. I&#39;ve been planning to try
    and put something together using one of the Adobe OpenType fonts, which have most
    of the glyphs you need for equations &#40;e.g. swash caps and Greek letters&#41;.
    The only missing glyphs &#40;apart from &#34;blackboard bold&#34; and blackletter&#41;
    are the geometric symbols representing mathematical operators, which can easily
    be taken &#40;perhaps slightly modified&#41; from elsewhere, since they need only
    match the base font in weight and size. &#40;The proportions and style are pretty
    fixed!&#41; Adam Lindsay has done <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/OpenType.pdf">some
    work</a> in this direction. <BR> <BR>For blackboard bold, one could just eviscerate
    the ordinary bold uppercase. You&#39;re unlikely to need more than two or three
    such letters anyway. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be very interested in hearing anyone else&#39;s

    <BR>&#39;Elements&#39; is almost universally praised as the best single book on
    typography, so I think you will be happy to have it.  <BR> <BR>Currently, I don&#39;t
    think the relation of your text block, margins and page look so good. It is too
    close to the page shape, which makes it dull. I think your old version, putting
    the heading numbers in the margins would look better, or following Bringhurst&#39;s
    design for a golden rectangle on A4 paper &#40;which is the ratio 1 to sq. root
    2&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The formula is this: the top and spine margin is 1/9th of the
    width of the page, and the bottom and outside margins are twice this. This will
    give you a golden rectangle in the text block, nicely positioned on the page.
    You can then adjust the size of your text to make this work. <BR> <BR>In general,
    Bringhurst&#39;s principle is &#34;Shape the textblock so that it balances and
    contrasts with the overall shape of the page&#34;. Usually, as with the above
    formula, the inner and top margins are less than what you have in relation to
    the bottom and outside margins. This assymetry &#39;locks&#39; together the facing,
    bound pages. <BR> <BR>Some other comments: I think your rule at the top of the
    page is too thick. And your title page is too shy compared to your chapter titles.
    The classic thing would be to use letter spaced caps or caps &amp; small caps,
    but that is only one idea. <BR> <BR>Overall, Bringhurst will give you guidance

    principle and other comments. Actually it was written in the memoir manual, the
    link I posted in the second post. But I had made a terrible mistake in typesetting
    the last sample. I have a different problem though. Now if I follow the advice
    of spine margin being equal to width/9 then the type block becomes around 33pica,
    that means around 75 characters per line at 12pt Garamond. So I certainly need
    wider margins. Now the question is should I divide the edge to spine margin in
    the ratio two to one, or make spine margin equal to the page width/9 and keep
    the remaining space as the edge margin? Thank you very much for your time. <BR>

  body: Your eye needs to make the decision. 75 characters is the outer limit for
    a comfortable read, according to Bringhurst, and as your text is broken up by
    equations, it may be fine at that length. As your line length increases, so should
    the leading, so you should also test out that variable with samples before making
    a decision. Another option is to increase the size of the text. I don&#39;t know
    what your version of Garamond looks like, but if it has a small x-height like
    Adobe Garamond, setting it at 13 to 14 point may be fine.  <BR> <BR>Typotheque
    is selling a paperback edition, according to the site.

    I will experiment with the margins and will post the test file in a day or two.
    Thank you very much. <BR> <BR>Rahul.

  body: 'Having been through the PhD process myself, permit me to state the obvious:
    the design doesn&#39;t matter that much to you, because you are going to get your
    PhD based on content judged by people who are very knowledgable about that content.
    The visual &#39;sell&#39; isn&#39;t that important to you. It is a good way to
    learn about typography, but not that important to this particular product.  <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t think the current version works well. You have a number of elements
    that by themselves could work, but don&#39;t work together to make a coherent,
    balanced set of pages. The running head with the rule frames the page as having
    equal margins left and right. Then you have the text with outside margins over
    twice the inside margins, and with little use of them. The effect is unbalanced.
    <BR> <BR>It might work with somewhat less of an outside margin and more of an
    inside margin, and the running head the same width as the text. But you have to
    try to see.  <BR> <BR>If you are going to put the numbers of the headings in the
    margins &#40;as I had recommended as an option&#41;, I think will look better
    if they are right aligned on the left page and left aligned on the right page.
    Also I would try puting the equation numbers in the margins as well, if you are
    going to go that route.  <BR> <BR>The large bold numbers in the margins are distracting.
    They need to me more discrete &#40;non bold or smaller size or both&#41;, or don&#39;t
    hang them in the margins. They need to be clearly subordinate if they are in the
    margins. Also I would check whether in labelling the heads lining &#40;full height&#41;
    numbers are better, especially if they hang in the margin.    <BR> <BR>The titles
    don&#39;t need to be both bold and big. The current large size and the way they
    are vertically spaced breaks the rhythm of the grid. Bringhurst recommends keeping
    everything in multiples of unit lines. That way lines on opposite pages line up
    with each other. Felici says you can also add half line gaps between paragraphs,
    and that way after two such they come back to the grid.  <BR> <BR>You have the
    luxury of so much space that I would stick to the grid. You can put heads in bold
    caps and sub heads lc bold in your normal size. Or, more classically, you can
    avoid bold altogether and use caps, small caps and italic as your options. <BR>
    <BR>Have fun playing with this, and don&#39;t worry about it! <BR> <BR>'
