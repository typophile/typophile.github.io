body: Hi. <BR> <BR>I am working on a poster right now that has to be a two color job.  However,
  i want to do some of the type with some wood block letters that i have procured.  How
  can I scan them in and make them a spot color as opposed to a cmyk image?   <BR>
  <BR>I would rather now scan in and convert it to a vector either, i&#39;m afraid
  that would take away from the texture of the imprints. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your
  help!

  body: Peter go to photoshopusers.com  <BR>The NAPP site is a good place to learn
    about using Photoshop for spot color jobs. What you want to do has to do with
    channels and putting graphic information in spot channels. I could explain it
    to you but it would take time.

  body: Thanks Daniel. <BR> <BR>Never worked with Spot Channels before, but I will
    look into it. <BR> <BR>A quick one though, does a spot job just have one channel?

  body: One channel per color. Deke McClelland had a great article about spot colors
    in Photoshop in Photoshop User magazine. He basicly reproduced a stamp thats worth
    a small fortune using channels and spot colors.

  body: If you are producing your final a/w in InDesign or Quark you can import a
    greyscale tiff into the program and apply spot &#40;or any other&#41; colour to
    that. Make sure your scans are of about 300dpi at the size you intend to use them.
