body: "Hi everyone, apologise for yet another first post/first typeface thread. \r\n\r\nI've
  been a long time lurker, and have enjoyed reading through the forums. I've been
  working on a couple of typefaces recently - drawing the characters in illustrator
  - and thought it was probably time to get some more experiences people to have a
  look, and hopefully get some honest feedback. \r\n\r\nPhylum is a mono-line geometric
  sans serif, and I'm trying to create something simple & no-fuss that still has a
  bit of character.\r\n\r\nAnyway, any feedback that anyone can give would be great!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dalelacy_typeface01_6543.jpg]"

    closer to give meaningful critique, but a few things off the shelf are the width
    of n vs. h and both vs. u. The x-height of k. The cumbersome y. The W with too
    much air inside it. The unbalanced S. Too wide J(?). Too tight @. And that e needs
    some optical compensation. It\u2019s so busy, I\u2019d take some weight off the
    bar at least."

  body: 'Here are some suggestions:  the top of the B bowl should be a bit larger,
    not at the same of the bottom one.  The bottom tail of the S should be longer,
    for now that s seems upside down. Th 3 seems too narrow compare to other number.
    The weight of some lower case letters are too heavy compare of the entire weight,
    (e,r,s,k,v,x) or the problem come from the image. The serif of the J seems longer
    I would try the same length of the I or in between. The v seems a bit off compare
    to the u,w and y. Try to insert a PDF file with text, this will be easier to analyse.
    Keep going. '

    of typophiles rules around external links so I didn't include it in my original
    post. Apologies if this is a no-no.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback, I can see
    what you mean about the weight of the lowercase letters especially the r,s,t,u,v

    These are interlocked, so treating letters as separate items is a gross misunderstanding."

    typeface started as a personal project as a way of working on something i'd never
    worked on before. I never really had the intention of creating a full working
    typeface, it was more of a way for me to experiment with drawing characters +
    letterspacing & kerning. \r\n\r\nHence why i've put it up on behance/my website
    as a personal graphic design project.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the process of creating
    the characters; I then started to entertain the idea of turning phylum into something
    which could possibly become a commercial font, which is why i've come to typophile
    to get some feedback on taking it to the next step.\r\n\r\nThanks for the links
    frank, that first link looks exactly like the kind of thing that will help me
    out a heap.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    it would go any further then this initial exercise, but I really got into drawing
    the characters, and as I said I started to entertain the idea of actually releasing

    way off being finished, and thats why it's great to get the feedback/help that
    i'm getting on here.\r\n\r\nI really like your comment about the space between
    shapes being interlocked with the shapes themselves - definitely something to
    think about in that for me.\r\n\r\np.s. I really like your typeface 'Aften', it

    don\\t see that often in geometric typefaces like these.\r\n\r\nk - I would make
    the arm a bit longer. You can do this by either bringing the arm and leg down
    a bit or make the arm slightly more horizontal.\r\ns - Quite small. I would make
    it a bit more wider.\r\ni/l/t - I would bring the curve down a bit to the baseline.
    Right now these letters seem to be floating a bit.\r\nh/n - These characters are
    a bit too condensed. I would make them a bit wider and leave /m/ the same width.\r\nw
    - Should be more condensed\r\nW - I quite like the design but I think it looks
    rather old-fashioned for a geometric typeface like this. Why don't you try a design
    more like the lowercase /w/?\r\nM - Too wide\r\nP - You could make the bowl a
    little higher to use more of the white space underneath.\r\ng - The slight curve
    isn't working for me. It looks too much like a /q/ to me with that curve. I would
    give the /g/ a proper tail.\r\n\r\nI'm also not a fan of the long descenders.
    I would shorten them a little. The descender of /f/ actually seems to be at the
    right depth.\r\n\r\nAlso, for a typeface like this it's common and in a sense
    certainly logical to design a one-story /a/ and /g/, but perhaps it's a nice idea
    to add the two-story /a/ and /g/ as alternates.\r\n"

    some sample text in illustrator in one weight, these glyphs are fine, but then
    if I change the weight of the same text some of these don't render. If the glyphs
    are named the same, and neither have an assigned unicode, is there any reason
    why they would be assigned differently?\r\n\r\nAlso, if I open the glyph window
