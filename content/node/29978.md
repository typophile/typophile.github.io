  body: "http://www.leblogmoto.com/mondial/index.html\r\n\r\nMondial have a rather
    nice dated hand-lettered logo, rather like Norton and Triumph, but they are cripplingly
    expensive.\r\nAll the others, except Honda, use a sans serif in various forms.
    Honda\u2019s is a slab serif.\r\nGuessing from the range of brands they are more
    sports/commuter-oriented than customs (Harley-like). Have you any thoughts about
    the logo is it going to be just type or have a mark as well?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "As I see it there are two ways to go here. Either you design something entierly
    new without inheritance from earlier motorcycle logos or you go for the similarity...\r\n\r\nIf
    you go for similarity the brands you mentioned above are (according to me) slightly
    more \"modern\" than for example Harley Davidson or Triumph. I would go for a
    fat and wide font like Annonce from Canada Type ore something like that. Something
    with impact. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/\r\n\r\nIf you on
    the other hand wish to do something more classic you can always use a font like
    Euphonia from Sentinel Type or Maximo from Red Rooster. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/euphonia/
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/maximo-rr/\r\n\r\nJust some spontaneous
    suggestions..."

  body: "My initial impression is that a falling (trust me, only MotoGP gods can get
    a bike over that far) logo might not be the right way to go for a motorcycle shop,
    the perspectives seem out for the various elements. I would also clean up some
    of the bumps caused by the outline, especially at the base of the M and N, at
    the top of the S and where the L meets the T.\r\nTim"

  body: I agree with Tim on this one, the elements look like they have been left behind
    when you added the 3d to the mark.  I like the type you've selected, which is
    it?
