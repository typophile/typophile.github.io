    places. \r\nPersonnaly I would recommand netherland: gerrit rietveld academie
    or werkplaats typografie (that's a 2 years master). There are other schools but
    i'm not really aware of the quality of the education.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gerritrietveldacademie.nl\r\nhttp://www.werkplaatstypografie.org"

    feel like someone recently told me that it is expensive for Americans to study

    they take international students and i can't imagine them learning dutch so fast

  body: "Jon, I studied for two years in Germany. German higher education is a different
    sort of animal. While there are a few graduate programs that are offered in English,
    German languages is still more or less something that cannot be gotten around.\r\n\r\nThe
    entire time I was a student here, I kept hearing great things about Dutch schools,
    and many of my classmates were waiting for the first opportunity to run for the
    border. So there could be something to these recommendations.\r\n\r\nStudying
    in the UK as an American is, at least in comparison with the rest of Europe, insanely
    expensive. Nevertheless, the total cost per year is still a little less than going
    to a private University in the US (even with the current Pound\u2013Dollar rate),
    if that helps. And you can use the same sort of loans."

    Expat Typophile! \r\n\r\nThat's interesting about the British schools in terms
    of comparing them to the US. That is something to keep in my mind. I wouldn't
    have thought that would be the case. In the end, it's going to cost a lot. It's
    possible I'm just more interested in being abroad for awhile, and if you're going
    to graduate school, I feel like you should be 100% motivated about the program
    you're attending. So perhaps it should be a search for a good program first, rather
    than place. Obviously it depends on your portfolio, but I wonder how much European
    schools value American designers? And I'm still curious about South American options...
    I could pick up the Spanish well. Anything in Spain, maybe?\r\n\r\n"

    for a place, too.\r\n\r\n> Obviously it depends on your portfolio, but I wonder
    how much European schools value American designers?\r\n\r\nI interviewed with
    several German schools, and all of the schools that answered my inquiries (half
    of the ones I contacted\u2026) seemed very interested. There are not many Americans
    studying at German universities, at least when one compares Americans to many
    other national groups. The exotic factor helps the admissions process speed along,
    I think. This might not be as true in the UK, where Americans tend to flock (relatively),
    because of the language.\r\n\r\nSwiss schools may be easier for Americans to get
    into than other for students from the EU. I think that Swiss schools have quotas
    for certain countries. Again, when you are applying from the US, you are competing
    against a smaller group that say, if you were applying from Germany or France,
    who are just across the border and share similar languages.\r\n\r\nI've heard
    good and bad things about design schools in Spain and Argentina (but I could say
    the same about the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, etc.\u2026). Maybe if
    you got a short list, you could visit a few first?"

  body: "Encouraging... OK. Here's more. So how do folks feel about this. At the moment,
    my design fire is burning a bit low. When I was an undergrad, I was WAY INTO graphic
    design. Now, after being a designer for a while I'm only WAY INTO certain areas
    of graphic design. Typography and books being the heavy hitters. What I feel as
    though I'm in need of at the moment, as a designer, is some inspiration and motivation.
    The type of freedom one experienced as an undergrad perhaps. I felt like an art
    back then. I guess I'm looking for something to stoke the fire, in a way. Can
    graduate school be used for this purpose? Has anybody used graduate school for
    this purpose?\r\n"

    havent really heard about this. at some universities with some degrees there are
    quotes for international students (HSG St.Gallen for example). i havent heard
    the same for art schools like the hgkZ. they take some international students
    every year, but so little that i cant think of a use for quotas there. a whole
    years' class in graphic design in zurich is max. 20 students. in the last years
    they've taken 15-18 with the initial process (most being swiss) and then exchange
    students to fill up to 20 if available.\r\n\r\nanyway, you wouldnt come around
    learning german if you'd want to study in switzerland."
