  body: "Well. How \"classic\" are you talking? If you're looking for something distinctly
    or historically \"London,\" then Baskerville or Eric Gill. Although I can't stand
    Gill's lowercase letters, I love the uppercase bold. \r\n\r\nWhat's the application?
    The main consideration is to choose a transitional classification or at least
    a face like Sabon with minimal bracketing. \r\n\r\nA few faces within the Garamond
    or Jenson LINEAGE would really suffice even though products of the Italian Renaissance
    exported to France. Just watch the bracketing and stress. \r\n\r\n\r\nAny other
    thoughts here?"

  body: "sabon... garamond... jenson... for england?\r\n\r\ni'd suggest johnston underground,
    gill sans, baskerville, caslon, clarendon - and that's pretty much about it.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: Johnson sounds good. Initially I was thinking perhaps a script/calligraphy
    type font but  don't think that would be too appropriate.

  body: "@David \u2014 Lineage is emphasized here. \"like Sabon with minimal bracketing.\"\r\n\r\nNot
    sure about Caslon. Although originating in Britain, it was the most widely used
    typeface in America thanks to Ben Franklin. Plus depending on what version you
    use, you're either getting an Old Style, a Transitional, or somewhere in the middle.
    What I was really trying to get across is that it's not really about the face,
    it's about the classification. Baskerville is a good rubric. \r\n\r\nAlthough
    it may be appropriate to use Johnston Underground, frankly, it's just that nice.
    It forsakes optics for numerics. "
