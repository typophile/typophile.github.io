<p>New Orleans is one of the oldest cities in the US; in fact, it is older than the United States itself. I knew that I would encounter many older signs because of the history and age of the city. New Orleans values the past, and sometimes has a hard time moving into the present. Because I am a new resident in New Orleans, a couple of signs stuck out in my head before I even started taking photos. Port of Call and Pandora’s Snowballs have very distressed looking signs. This was not the reason these signs stuck out in my head. They were memorable regardless of their condition. New Orleans business owners seem to not place importance on having a clean and sterile sign to invite tourists, they seem to rely on the old world charm to bring the tourist into their establishments.</p>
<p>New Orleans is known as being a city that is a hybrid of US/European traditions.  New Orleans has a rich Spanish and French history and this is present everywhere you look. New Orleans is also a modern city, home to two professional sports teams and numerous oil refineries and chemical plants. This is also easily seen in some of the signage. There are many hand painted signs that employ script fonts from the past, yet there is something very American about the Blue Plate signage from a factory that closed down long ago. The dualism of New Orleans is seen through its signs.</p>
<p>The most noticeable differences between signage in New Orleans and the rest of the US is that other cities tend to have newer signs. They utilize newer fonts and a less distressed appearance. Old signs are not acceptable to the public in those cities and people might not frequent an establishment that looks run down from the sign.  This is not to say that New Orleans is without newer signage. The new YWCA sign uses Helvetica to create a simple yet modern sign on the front of their building.</p>
<p>The most distinct thing about New Orleans is that the residents and business owners celebrate the new and the old, and this is seen in the use of its signage.</p>
