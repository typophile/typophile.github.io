body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm wondering, if there's any chance to prevent Indesign and
  other applications from breaking letter combinations when the tracking threshold
  is exceeded.\r\nI've some kind of (faked) random opentype feature programming in
  the contextual alternates feature of my font. For it's not a script font and the
  letter combinations are not meant as ligatures, I'd like to deactivate this behavior
  in type setting applications, preferably by Opentype programming. I guess it's not
  possible, but maybe... Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n"

  body: Most page layout programs allow for exceptions in their H&J settings, but
    I doubt that you can program a font to write those exceptions to the dictionary.
    Also, it's doubtful that a font could be programmed to switch H&J on and off at
    will. If the letter combinations are really that important, make them ligatures
    and be done with it. It may not be your ideal solution, but it's one that will
    work.

  body: "AFAIK, the ligature feature ceases to work when tracked out.\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of behaviour in a layout application makes sense for Ligature features such
    as the traditional \"fi\", and for the original exegesis of Contextual Alternates
    as something for cursive scripts (IIRC Caflisch, released in 2001, was instrumental
    in establishing this concept).\r\n\r\nNow it's been grandfathered, and we're stuck
    with it, even if we want to use \"calt\" for pseudo-randomisation, where it would
    be appropriate to keep the effect operative whatever the tracking.\r\n\r\nThere
    has been a \"rand\" feature defined for several years, but it is no use unless
    supported by Quark and InDesign, which it isn't.\r\n\r\nShame, I've designed a
    couple of \"pseudo-random\" faces, and it's something that really interests me.\r\n\r\nActually,
    not really \"pseudo-random\", but \"pseudo-natural\", or \"non-repetitive\".\r\nThat's
    because if the goal is to make digital type have the natural irregularities of
    letterpress printing or ink writing, randomly selecting the iteration of a character
    from a group of variant glyphs won't do that, as statistically there will be quite
    a few adjacent doublings."

  body: "Well, it's not about certain letter combinations, but about randomness. It's
    pseudo randomness, though. I picked up the examples from Thomas Phinney and Nick
    Shinn (http://www.typophile.com/node/19625).\r\nBy the way, the problem applies
    to ligatures as well, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nEdit: I missed posting this earlier.
    I was in preview mode... well, hello Nick. :)\r\nRegarding the ligature feature,
    Indesign (CS3 in my case) breaks the fi ligature at about +16."

    feature is implemented by the \"all caps\" command, command-shift-k on Mac.\r\n(If
    the user doesn't want it, the shift key and caps lock do not activate it.)\r\nAnd
    of course, nobody ever letterspaces lower case...\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to
    test whether that would work, as I don't put \"cpsp\" in my fonts."

  body: "Thanks for the link Grrrben. As John Hudson stated at the end of that thread,
    negative tracking values have more tolerance before breaking the ligatures. So
    my workaround now is to increase the spacing within the font. This way it is possible
    to use negative values up to -44 (InDesign). It's a crutch, but at the moment
    I can live with that. It's a rather scrawly handdrawn font with capital letters
    only, so the wider standard spacing is not an issue.\r\n\r\nThanks to you as well,
    Nick. Though, I tend to use the all caps feature in Indesign to get alternative
    combinations more quickly. \r\nSpeaking of quick access and convenience, does
    anyone know, whether there is easier access to Opentype features, especially stylistic
    sets, implemented in InDesign CS5? I have to muddle through three flyout menus
    to switch them on or off in my CS3 version."

  body: "I'd like to revive this threat for I've experimented with position values
    in stylistic sets. For InDesign users, it would be possible to have a wider spacing
    by choosing stylistic set 17, which simply has the following code:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    ss17 {\r\nposition @ALL <0 0 50 0>;\r\n} ss17;</code>\r\n\r\nBy further experiments
    with y values I came to some interesting results with dancing glyphs or uneven
    lines. Funny stuff to play with. \r\nOne irritating issue, though: when it comes
    to hyphenation, some stylistic sets with positional programmings cause a missing
    glyph right after a discretionary hyphen. \u201C.notdef\u201D is displayed then.
    I thought, I could at least leave out the visible shape in the .notdef slot and
    actually it hides (while still marked as missing glyph) in InDesign. But when
    printed to PDF, a quoteleft (\u2018) shows up after the hyphen. Could somebody
    figure out, what's wrong here. Maybe I'm missing an important modifier letter
    in my font or the like?\r\n\r\n"

  body: The Stylistic Set features are specifically described in the spec as GSUB
    features, not GPOS. This means that you can't predict what applications will do
    if you put GPOS lookups into these features, so it should be avoided.
