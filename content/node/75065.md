  Seventeenth St. NW \r\nWashington, DC\r\n\r\nhttp://printinghistory.org/programs/conference.php\r\n\r\n(This
  presentation was first given at ATypeI in Dublin, September, 2010, http://www.atypi.org/03_Dublin/40_timetables/main/main12sept_html?date=20100912)\r\n\r\nAlthough
  rarely studied in today's classroom, commercial engraving for print is a vital element
  in the teaching of graphic design and media studies at the college and university
  level. This notion, which will be explored in the proposed presentation, is based
  on more than a decade of independent study of steel die and copper plate engraving,
  the recent installation of a working engraving proofing press within the Loyola
  University of New Orleans graphic design department and the establishment of a new
  and growing engraving community in New Orleans. This is the first new and only robust
  commercial print engraving community in North America.\r\n\r\nThe legacy through
  which we have studied, and viewed, graphic design, typography and the book arts
  primarily has been through the lens of the letterpress form. For over 500 years,
  almost all of our print communication was fashioned within this framework and according
  to a specific, or implied grid (grid being the series of units aligning both vertically
  and horizontally in an intentional, recognizable pattern). In the western world,
  almost every description of commercial visual communication is presented in this
  format; books, newspapers, periodicals, even the orientation and navigation of websites
  depend on a grid for their structure.\r\n\r\nEngraving, on the other hand, is a
  fluid, free-hand expression restricted only by the perimeter of the surface upon
  which an engraving is worked. The exquisite beauty and gracefulness of arcs and
  shading inherent in the engraved line is unparalleled and had become, until very
  recently, an unfortunately moribund craft.\r\n\r\nThis twenty minute presentation
  addresses ways in which the organic nature of steel die and copper plate engraved
  imagery and text complement and enhance visual experience, why and how engraving
  is a central part of any modern graphic design curriculum, and dynamic ways that
  it can be introduced in the classroom. By providing examples of elegant and unique
  engraved imagery, we can inspire the next generation of visual thinkers to keep
  this important art form alive.\r\n\r\n\xA9 2010 Nancy Sharon Collins"
