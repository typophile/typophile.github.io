body: Hi, again, wise-people. I want to know, in your opinion, what is the best open
  type feature to use with alpha-numeric ordinals (in fact, better say numeric-alphabetic
  ordinals). See the attached sample. I want to program a open type feature to use
  with this kind of gliph, where the first character is a arabic number, followed
  by a abreviation, like "1st", "2nd", "3rd"... But, I have two or three different
  kinds of each ordinal to program...

  body: "Thanks, Nick. Taking a look, the programation seems very hard to do! But
    I will learn and use it, anyway, because I think this kind of resource is very
    interesting in a good font. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I appreciate the critics from
    the coleagues at Typophile about the aesthetic solutions to this font, Penabico.
    So, I create a new theme in the Calligraphic forum, at http://typophile.com/node/74385
    - in the first post I need recomendations about the Thorn\r\n\r\nbest regards,
    and thanks, for all"

  body: "Yes, it is long-winded, but you have to do it this way in order to make the
    feature applicable in a Paragraph Style, and not have every letter made superscript,
    only those in \"1st\", \"2nd\", \"3rd\" etc., -- and also \"11th\", \"12th\",
    \"13th\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe benefit is that each instance of an ordinal doesn't have
    to be individually selected and styled."
