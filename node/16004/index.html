  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hey, here is a revised set. Im liking the back monogram and am thinking of using this on the front,what do you guys think of lines i added?(to the front )
And as for a picture of the jewelry,i dont have any sorry,but i can tell you its very busy with a collection of different shells,im trying to emphasise the hand made quality of it but also put it into a professional context,so that is why i thought of hadriano because it is a sturdy type face but the &lsquo;a&rsquo; still has character. So i thought that the packaging and card should complement the jewllery without mimicking its visual aspects.
I hope this makes sense!?
-Al
/edit/ Hey i have posted a new card still final touches to be made but i have added colour,i should have explained earlier that this is for a family friend,and the card u see is the front and the back,i also have made some stickers which will be used on lime green/light blue packaging,and there is a price tag sticker there too but its a bit wierd(the paua shell)
And the whole punch idea is good,but i think its alittle time consuming,but gave me some ideas as to showing the product through it as these cards and stickers will be placed on or with the neclaces,earings e.t.c.
thanks alot for all of the helpful input,its been better than bad its good.
Al (as in Alistair-a guy) :)
ps is it &lsquo;jewellery&rsquo; or' jewelry'&hellip;.?</div>

Two: that is an expensive card, a full bleed card, plus it paints you into a corner it terms of other communications.  Their is no flexibility with that design. Three: In the future being a web designer please post your images in web frendly formats like jpg and gif.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I quite like the arrangements of the dots, maybe you could get a bit more mileage out of that. As for the typography, the 4th example (Castellar?) doesn&rsquo;t seem appropriate (Not that I&rsquo;ve read the brief). For some reason I&rsquo;m drawn to the second option (not sure what the font is) but would prefer to see the tagline in Avenir-Light as per 3rd example.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to resonsider the contact details, I can appreciate the contrast that you&rsquo;re trying for with the san/serif used next to each other, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working.</p>
<p>Thats my 2 cents worth.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I think as you are a jewel designer you are the best one who knows which fonts to use. But I will tell you how I think your card would look better for me. 
at backgrounds I like first one at top. I would prefer to make &ldquo;K&rdquo; darker than the illustration in its background, you may even make it black, so you can balance with the huge white space more. You may try also to resize that jewel illustration to make it bigger and make part of it as if it is out of the card { it is just a suggestion here }.</p>
<p>For the front face, I disagree with the illustration at first card at top, circles over darkbackground can have many meanings, something like stars or globes in sky, may be? 
the one at bottom which contains same circles with one line is a nice gemotrical abstract for jewellery, it tells me that you are simple and modern. You still base your jewels on circle shape only, why not a polligrame or triangel also, or any shape which is entitled to jewels?  if you want circles only because it is related to your style, or any reason I think your name should have to change the idea of writing your name with normal font, you may go to some display font which has a cirlce gemotric basic.. I suggest here an  idea: what about making letters of your name as jewels and make the line pass them instead of passing some circles? that may require the name to be bigger in scale, and require a new, less effortive, and better orgnized layout.</p>
<p>I would recommend the  text to change in some parts to be like: Tel. Mob. E-mail/Email/email.  + &ldquo;New Zeland designer jewellery&rdquo; that way and in italic. It will be fine if you use a serif font for it either. And I recommend to be sure of leading between lines because the spaces between lines aren&rsquo;t look equal for me in your information area.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it looks great, and I&quot;m talking about the .jpg you posted.I think you could look at the type, but I think you&rsquo;re pretty close. I would work on the informational type that is now in the sans serif, either make it flush with the other information or move it enough so it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;almost&rdquo; flush. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going to hole punch the holes or not, but that would be a nice touch. The lines are great. Don&rsquo;t show photos of the product on the business card. Keep in ambiguous enough that it doesn&rsquo;t get outdated. I wouldn&rsquo;t change too much on this, it&rsquo;s clean, simple and elegant. How about instead of black doing a metallic silver or bronze? Overall, a great job.</div>

<p>Now guncry, I think the front and the back are at odds. One side is static and the other is dynamic. One of the versions you produced looked more like a topography map than the desired jewel chain. I think to use a different font for “New Zealand designer jewelry” is a bad idea, keep consistent, and legible. Check it…</p>
