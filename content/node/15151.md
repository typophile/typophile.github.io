  body: you look at 'new' and it's about 5 'what font is this' boring as hell and
    if it keeps up it will be the death of typophile just like comp.fonts or other
    older places that had professionals sharing ideas but it turned into idiots pirates
    sharing fonts.

  body: "Vince, if a stranger stopped you on the street to ask for directions to someplace
    you knew was just around the corner, would you advise them to get a map?\r\n\r\nAs
    someone who sometimes helps people identify fonts here, I'd like to make a few
    observations.\r\n\r\nIdentifying fonts is not an easy thing, and it gets harder
    every day, given the continual growth of the font universe. It's easy to say \"go
    look it up yourself,\" but that can easily take hours if the font is not common
    or doesn't happen to be in the particular font catalogs you happen to have, with
    no guarantee you will find what you are looking for. Many of the people who come
    here have said they have already tried to do it themselves and failed. I have
    several dozen specimen books, from around 1900 to the present, and even I am unable
    to identify a font sometimes, even with all these resources at hand. The typical
    designer may have a couple of font catalogs around. Most designers I know can
    identify common fonts on sight, but beyond that, they just shrug. As for non-designers,
    I think a service like this is rather a consciousness raising experience for them.\r\n\r\nThe
    main problem is that fonts cannot be easily and unambiguously categorized. Many
    systems have been devised, but none are as reliable or complete as, say, a dictionary
    or a thesaurus. When someone is looking at a font, they may not even have a good
    idea where to start looking. You have examples like the FontShop catalog in which
    a script font might be found under \"Script\" or \"Display\" for no obvious reason.
    And when you have hundreds of fonts listed alphabetically under one category,
    make sure you've had your morning coffee. Finding fonts in font catalogs is more
    an art than a science.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you have the Font ID Board here,
    where there are people who can identify fonts on sight, even obscure ones. In
    fact, when I contribute, I spend more time finding a sample to link to than identifying
    the font. And those sample links are nearly always to a place where you can buy
    the font.\r\n\r\nPersonally, unless I can identify the font immediately, or it's
    something I am curious about myself, I pass. Plus, as a type designer, spending
    time poring over type specimen books is never time wasted.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I realize
    that many people here have little interest in this topic area. I actually avoided
    myself it for a long time. I think what Typophile needs to do is add some kind
    of filter to the \"new\" or \"active topic\" pages so people can filter out the
    topic areas they are not interested in."

    in Firefox. Then I just click on the Forums bookmark on the toolbar so I don't
    have to go to the home page. \r\n\r\nAlso because the powers that be haven't yet
    restored the navigation menu with 'Design', 'General' etc to be accessible from
    every page *ahem, ahem, hint, hint*, I have also dragged the categories I usually
    look at to the toolbar. Then I can use the bookmarks on the toolbar to navigate.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "I am not a big fan of this category of posting in general either but I think
    Mark is right. And eloquent too. One day I could be stuck & will feel quite grateful
    if I am helped. \r\n\r\nCertainly if you don't know the answer (or do) you could
    point at the resource you think most likely to help. When the resources area comes
    back then there might be a type ID area that points at these resources.\r\n\r\nThe
    one thing I don't like is the often ambiguous titling of the 'what is this font'
    category of posting. But that is just what a new or uninvolved user is likely
    to do & there isn't much that can be done about that. \r\n\r\nFinally, if somebody
    is willing to ID fonts & is good at it ( & they are very good ) then I would have
    to say it's not too much skin off my nose! \r\n\r\nBTW, thanks again for posting
    the Cleartype hinting info!"

  body: "Mark, I agree. And it's certainly at least entertaining to watch you and
    the other master hounds nail an ID so well and as fast. I dropped out of the hunts
    long ago when I realized I was not good enough. Also, if I were a type user (I
    just make the stuff) I would clearly be an avid fan of the type-ID section on
    practical grounds.\r\n\r\nOne other thing: some people (like Gary Much on Typo-L,
    I remember) have opposed type identification on the grounds that it promotes piracy.
    To that I would say that anybody who we manage to reel into Typophile by whatever
    means is more likely to <cite>reduce</cite> any piratical activity when exposed
    to actual humans who make the stuff.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOne thing I <cite>am</cite>
    curious about though is the reasons people ask for an ID. Is it mostly out of
    curiously about something that appeals to them, or they need to ID a font from
    an old setting so they can make more stuff with it? Survey says?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    trying to pummel my poor brain into remembering the name of something I know perfectly
    well). \r\n\r\nOne of the reasons some requests come with a short/curt message
    is that the poster is not confident in their English, I can't see why that should
    count against them. As for unknown posters, everybody is identified by some kind
    of user name if you have developed some disliking for them just don't answer their
    post. There was a situation recently of people posting one letter which was some
    competition but that seems to have died off (been frightened off by Yves).\r\n\r\nThe

    strip for a computer game)\r\nWork (I need to recreate this logo)\r\nIdle curiosity

    from my informal observations. It is a category that I very rarely visit. This
    does not detract at all from my enjoyment of Typophile. My favourite category
    is Critique, which is generally pretty slow in terms of new topics and comments.
    The two different styles of posting and comment seem to co-exist quite happily,
    as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nI suppose this is like a newspaper. I do not
    have much interest in sport, but I would not say that a newspaper is boring just
    because it contains many pages of sport. As long as it has the information and
    comment I enjoy reading, it is a good newspaper."
