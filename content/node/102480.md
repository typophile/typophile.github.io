body: "Great design, because it signals its anti-establishment cred with a Jamie Reid
  punk-style ransom note collage, playing off that culture-jamming clich\xE9 to engage
  the viewer into concluding that the letters are torn from Big Food packages.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  as an art director I\u2019m aware how protective those companies are of any unauthorized
  commercial use of their trademarks, or part thereof, and suspect that this is a
  deception.\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m engaged too!\r\nAre you?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15797397_6065.jpg]"

    my cupboard \u2014 I avoid sugared/fat filled/salty/unhealthy stuff), my conclusion
    is that all of the clippings originated in custom mockups, using the vocabulary
    and design characteristics of said suspects."

    logo, but the background is blue instead of red. The \u201CG\u201D and \u201Ca\u201D
    look like they\u2019re from the same logo, as do the \u201CA\u201D and \u201CT\u201D.
    Can\u2019t quite place them, though."

  body: It's a nice design. I'm sure Random House's lawyers determined this would
    be covered by the fair use exemption for transformative use of artwork ("...altering
    the original with new expression, meaning, or message..."). And it might be considered
    parody, which is also protected.

  body: "Perhaps in the calculation of costs Vs. benefits, none of these corporations
    would wish to bring further negative attention to the subject of how they manipulate
    the food chain by going after the filmmaker in a david and Gollieth battle over
    a court could see as just a questionable infringement. It's no different than
    music sampling of the 3 second rule for playing snippets of music without having
    to pay royalties.\r\n\r\nUnless some of them are owned by Monsanto, in wich case
    Mr. Bertelsmann probably already has black SUVs slowly driving past his front
    door."
