body: I'm stuck on trying to find something close to the type used in the new Corbis
  logo. I know it's a custom design, but I'm particularly interested in finding a
  suitable replacement that mimics the C, O and S. Anyone have some suggestions? I
  know I've seen something close recently but just can't put my finger on what I was
  looking at. Any suggestions are helpful! Thank you!

    of the Akzidenz Grotesk work well, too but not close enough for what I''ve got
    in my head. '

  body: New Corbis logo indeed is similar to Smart logo, especially s and r. When
    I saw the new Corbis logo, I thought Veer made a compelete new typeface with it.
    Now, looks like there are nice alternatives. :)
