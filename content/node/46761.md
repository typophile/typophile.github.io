body: "Hi Everyone.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your comments on these wine label
  ideas the type CDV I am working on. This is my first time working on a wine label.
  It's lots of fun - and challenging too!!! However, I am having a tough time with
  the CDV type. Needs help, but at this point I am not sure how to help it. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nProject:
  Chateau de Vie wine label\r\n\r\nThis project I made up because I wanted to help
  this vineyard, and I thought it would be a good opportunity to get into the wine
  biz. These guys run a bed and breakfast in Napa, California USA, and they have a
  vineyard as well. Their BnB is very nice, sophisticated, warm and cozy (kind of
  like Pottery Barn farmhouse style).\r\n\r\nHere is a description of their CABERNET
  SAUVIGNON - 'Darkly fruity nose of brandied cherries, bouillon, vanilla and rich
  forest floor scents with peppery hints in the background. Somewhat fleshy on the
  palate, where it shows deeply ripe cherry fruit tied to lots of mocha, vanilla,
  baking spice and toasty flavors.'\r\n\r\nThey do a very limited run each year, and
  are on a modest budget. They charge about $35/40 us dollars per bottle. So, it is
  not a budget wine or a premium high end wine either.\r\n\r\nI tried to play around
  with different label shapes, a natural paper label and a colored label. Some with
  an image of the Chateau (this actual image in layout is FPO) and some without. From
  one perspective I wanted to use the bottle as a marketing tool for their BnB as
  well. That is why on some I used an image of the Chateau. However, on some concepts
  I tried a label without an image of the Chateau.? Some styles lean more toward classic,
  and some a little more colorful. Currently they use the acronym CDV. This is why
  I kept some with CDV, but I am wondering if my treatment of CDV is too simple.\r\n\r\nCan
  you guys tell what you think in general? Label shapes? Type? Color? More?\r\n\r\nI
  appreciate your help. Thank you!!!! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChateauDeVie_Label_5743.jpg]"

  body: "5B would be my choice as it is most memorable and incorporates the house
    which I believe should be included based on what you said. Wine is a tough market
    and the orange color in this label with the bold type, I think is most memorable.\r\n\r\nMy
    one big problem is I think you should use a small 'd' as in 'CdV' the way it would
    be written.\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "I live in California wine country, and 5B definitely stands out among the
    labels I've seen in my experience.  It perfectly fits a modern California vibe,
    and also does a good job of rebuffing a lot of the snobbishness that is creeping
    into the wine making culture here.  Good work.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    the orange colour of C versions to complement the B. And I'd definitely change
    the font of CDV in 5B to some serif font.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "I like 5B&C, C being more classic. I like the burnt orange in 6A&C. You could
    move the chateau to the top and die cut it out? \r\nI'm a fan of the torn edge,
    it gives an organic look to the labels, but I don't know anything about the manufacturing
    process(cost).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wine_4771.gif]"
