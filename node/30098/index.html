  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The question is, on the surface, really a no brainer. The answer is use InDesign CS2. But let me tell you my problem and then hopefully some of you can give me experienced opinions.

I have a client for whom I am to typeset/design 2 books. Previous to this the publisher which my client uses only had Quark 4. But, miracles do happen and they  upgraded. They now have InDesign CS1 and Quark 6. I have very little experience with the .INX file format as for all other clients I handle the printing and so don't need to save backwards.

My question is this. If I do the books in InDesign CS2 and then export them as Interchange (.INX) files will the formatting be safe? Or should I just use Quark 6 and call it a day?

Thanks!</div>

Tiff, I <em>have</em> had interchange files not work. I think that's risky business, particualry for such large text oriented documents. My computer <em>freaked</em> the funk out when I tried to keep both Adobe CS1 and 2 on my 'puter. I had to trash all previous versions from my system.

Perhaps not from their perspective.
Obsolescence is also an ideological issue.
I try not to upgrade immediately on principle, and also to give 'em time to work the bugs out.</div>

Waiting for bugs to be dealt with is one thing (Not that Adobe cares enough to patch non-security stuff anymore...), but still using Quark 6, or for that matter the CS 1 suite, at this point is just silly. If nothing else updating everything to the CS2 suite brings in enough new time saving features that it should pay for itself.</div>

Real pain in my a** as it required the client to gather these files from farflung sources and we lost nearly a week.</div>

The sucky part is I still can't use OT because it was already like a death-match to get these guys to license the fonts back when we were all using OS 9 and Quark 4. But this is a huge step in the right direction.

Well I'm relieved that they offered you a middle road, Tiffany. My position would have been to ask the publisher either to upgrade or to relinquish control over the final file handoff – strikes me as pretty unreasonable to expect both.

Like Terry, I've had experience of multiple versions of ID not playing happily together, and the QX-to-ID conversion is simply an unknown every time one does it. None of this translates as the basis for a deliverable project to me.

Y'know, I never thought I'd find myself saying this here, but even if the choice were between <em>current</em> versions of ID and QX, it would still be a no-brainer; this is based on recent observation of massive industry indifference to (and absence from) the Quark 7 launches in Australasia. Has it been the same in the US?</div>

From what I've read CS3 is more like six months out, but I'll be smiling if it only takes four. I'm still surprised how many businesses are on CS1, but I guess if you're not doing a lot of Illustrator/Photoshop work, it probably isn't a big deal.

Pretty much. Young designers have never used it and don't want to bother, older designers are still pissed about years of Quark not really doing anything special. And it doesn't help that the only cost that can make Quark competitive to Indesign would be less than zero.</div>

I tend to mock-up in CS2, set the book in CS2, then convert to CS1 before shipping them a PDF for proofing. This allows me to use many of the new features during the intensive stages of design & setting, but also builds in a certain safety net as any bugs that get introduced during the conversion process will be found during proofing. It's frustrating, and I've done my share of "encouraging" them to upgrade, but it's really not that big a deal.</div>

I'd suggested to you to work with Indsign CS2 and export your file in pdf for your client.

I've recently bought the Markzware plugin Q2ID (also existed for ID2Q) and it works really well when I transfert file form Xpress to Indesign CS2. Nothing is losted. I've encountered minor problem when I've printed the job I've transfered, but now it's solved. I've had to resave in an other format some image which one was'nt printed out at the final output.</div>

the grey box thing is an .inx issue. the .inx file is just XML so when the file is opened, InD has to reconstruct everything, including the jpeg previews of all images. the fact that it doesn't retain the image info is actually a blessing because it's the only way to drastically reduce file size with an image-heavy doc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Biddy - you must be at Berkley Books! LOL

Meanwhile, just wanted to share that many times designers forget that they are working with outside suppliers. Many printers are scared of the "next" generation. When Quark 4 started working after the debugging (originally only page 1 would get screened and none of the other pages in the document would) and it worked well with Illustrator 5.5 and 6.0 and Photoshop 4 (or was that 5) the printers were celebrating. They had spent nearly 100 years getting their shops to perform efficiently -- and then technology showed up.

I am on Quark 6 -- and with the printers I deal with, I would want no other program. I have InDesign here, and I have had to use it on occasion, but find it awkward. But that's me; after all, I was an original Beta and Gamma tester for Quark and have stayed loyal. I own Quark 7 -- but because my main printer doesn't own it yet - which means he does, but hasn't perfected it on his equipment yet -- there is no reason for me to move on at this point.

I do know that one particular printer in Pennsylvania adores Indesign and has started insisting his customers all switch over. But it's odd. Most printers convert our files to .eps and onto .pdf -- and btw, Quark 7's pdf's are easily recognized by old equipment.

Just my two cents worth.</div>

I still use primarily Quark too - mostly because it is my "first" language, and when I use InD I still feel like I have to translate. I'm sure that over time I'll get more comfortable with it. More and more of my clients are switching over to it, so I gotta ride the wave.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Patty, you sound just like me! Old dog -- comfy with System 9 -- Quark default go-to software. I live and work out in the boonies in complete isolation, and used to be able to take care of everything in system 9, trouble-shooting printing and the network, etc. Once I moved to X I lost all that ease, although I'm slowly learning X. 

InDesign? I bought the whole CS suite when I upgraded Photoshop (I do a lot of work as a photographer so that's an essential tool) so got ID and swore I would learn it. But every big project that came along, I would stay with Quark. Now I have upgraded to CS2 and am still in the same boat: I simply have to commit to using CS2 on a real project and jump in feet first. Meanwhile my largest client and I do everything in Quark 6.5. I've been using Quark since 1986 and despite all my complaints about customer service, company attitudes, etc. I find I can think more intuitively in it than anywhere else.

I used to have a 21 inch SuperMac grayscale monitor and really miss it -- I found it to be so restful and neutral for working with lots of type on the page, but at some point, I think when I got my G3 back in 1993, I could no longer get it to sync up with newer computer.

Au contraire mon freire! Live Trace in Illustrator has saved me HOURS of work; time I'd waste converting vector art in Flash. 

<em>Biddy - you must be at Berkley Books! LOL</em>

Nope, one of the NY magazine publishers. They refused to switch to later versions of Quark because they were "too buggy." :)

Back on the InD Quark debate: the both have their moments. I curse them both. Quark handles images (wrap around text) much better than InDesign. It drives me to distraction making clipping paths in Photoshop only then having to draw a vector outline in InDesign for my text. Much easier in Quark.

No drop shadows in Quark (until v. 7). (BOO!) I like InD drop shadow feature, but they still have transparency issues when ripping to a printer of making a PDF. (DOUBLE BOO!) But the type...oh the type in InDesign makes all the headaches worth it. I've already gotten used to InD OpenType menu, and Quark JUST got one. Way to stay ahead of the curve. My evaluation: Quark for image based layout, InDesign for text based.</div>

I'd give up nothing, they both have their flaws. I use InDesign exclusively. I used to use Quark exclusively. They both have a ways to go in terms of functionalty. In an ideal world I could buy both.

I always thought InDesign was supposed to be love child of Quark and PageMaker, but it seems still skewed towards PM's "strengths."

Certainly, CS 1 and 2 are a massive step-up from InDesign 1.5, which I used at one client's office for a project: now <strong>that</strong> was a clunker....</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking of fine typography in Quark, I was particularly fond of 3.32r5 because I could subtly adjust the rag of FL text. That version had the add-ons "Bob" and "Son of Bob" and allowed me to track word spaces only, thereby retaining the desired color of the text within words, but ever-so-slightly expanding or contracting the word spaces to make lines longer or shorter in measure. I used that feature a lot. Then along came version 4 and, as far as I know, the word space tracking disappeared.  Does anyone know if this can be done in newer versions of Quark (I have 6.5 at the moment) or in InDesign (I have CS2)?

All the discussion here is certainly pushing me off my duff and I'm going to crack open InDesign and get to know it.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>No drop shadows in Quark (until v. 7). (BOO!) I like InD drop shadow feature, but they still have transparency issues when ripping to a printer of making a PDF. (DOUBLE BOO!) But the type…oh the type in InDesign makes all the headaches worth it. I’ve already gotten used to InD OpenType menu, and Quark JUST got one. Way to stay ahead of the curve. My evaluation: Quark for image based layout, InDesign for text based.<i>

Biddy - If you go to Quark 7 - you must also upgrade to Mac OS 10.4 or higher. It doesn't work on the 10.3.9 or lesser.

Also, the drop shadows are nice - but if you hand your job over to someone on Quark 6.5 - all drop shadows are lost.

RIght now, if you use Quark 7 to made PDFs to give to your printer - chances are great that your printer, should he not have Quark 7 -- will not be able to use those PDFs. You have to open them up in the latest Adobe Acrobat -- and resave them. There is definitely something amiss here...

But you know - I'll still take all that over InDesign. Honest. Maybe I have become an old dog!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I'm somewhat surprised that you found the InDesign kerning numbers confusing, as they are exactly the same as what you are using when you design your fonts--1000 to the em. 

If you use keyboard short-cuts to kern, I see it would be confusing shifting from one system to another.
 
Googling I found this tip from Ilene Strizver:

"If you use both QuarkXPress and InDesign (or another Adobe design application), remember that these programs kern to different unit values. QuarkXPress kerns to 1/200 of a unit, while the default for InDesign is 1/1000 of a unit. This means that a kern value of -5 in QuarkXPress is equal to -25 in InDesign. You can make the transition back and forth simpler by changing InDesign’s default unit value to 20/1000 (equivalent to QuarkXPress’s 1/200) in Preferences/Units & Increments."

On the shortcuts in InDesign, from the help file:  

"Press Alt+Left/Right Arrow (Windows) or Option+Left/Right Arrow (Mac OS) to decrease or increase the kerning between two characters. 
When you kern using these shortcuts, the increment used is 1/50 of the em space for the current type size. 
Holding down Ctrl or Command when you use these keystrokes multiplies the kerning increment value by 5 with each keystroke."

Translating that into 1000-to-the-em points, Alt/Opt gives you 20 points (4 Quark points) and adding the Ctrl/Command gives you 100 (20 Quark points).

[note: I was editing and clarifying this while Chris cross-posted. I came to see the source of the confusion--which Chris explains below--while looking into it further.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William,
I started using Quark in 1986 and used it until just a few years ago. I had developed and honed a series of style sheets with tracking and H&Js in Quark which was a very ingrained and productive part of my workflow for 15 years. I did not start using FontLab until after I made the switch to InD so I had no FontLab history to refer to at the time. Also, there is a huge difference in creating a kerning pair as part of designing a typeface and actually laying out pages of text to fit a publication. The numerical value as a ratio does not tell you much, it is something you come to know by seeing and doing. It is more like switching from the English System of measure after 15 years of use to the Metric System without anyone telling you that there was a difference in size between an inch and a centimeter. You can teach an old dog new tricks but you at least have to inform the dog that the old trick has changed.

That's not a "change" that's a "feature."  ;-)

Seriously, though, I did the vast majority of my work in DC on Quark, but when I moved back here and started cranking up my business again, I found that probably 99% of the work was in PageMaker, and then InDesign.  When you don't get a choice from clients, you learn PDQ.

I've got friends at several of the high-end printers here in town, and they tell me that Quark jobs are few and far between these days.  I know one of the mega advert firms here was strictly a Quark shop, but even they are converting over.

Maybe it's a geographical thing?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Re geography: I once heard - some years ago - that while Quark was the lingua franca in NY, most of the country was still using Pagemaker, which surprised me since there was NO comparison btw those two softwares. And quite frankly, if Quark hadn't been so bloody arrogant about their upgrades and flexibility, Adobe might never have gotten their foot in the door. But I think even in NY where Quark is still used a lot, the trend is toward InD and unless Quark blows us away with some new hat trick that trend will continue.

I don't think you're allowed to upgrade from two versions back. You'll probably have to buy a whole new package. I'd check to see which is cheaper, 2 upgrades...or one full price purchase.</div>

As there are plenty of cheap PS 7 packages around, the investment is quite reasonable. I don't think that policy is going the change…

Eg the upgrade price for a full CS 2.3 Publishing suite is about 750 dollars. In this case Photoshop 7 (and even earlier) is required. Updating to 3 may be 500 bucks…

I asked the question because I was really impressed with the features demonstrated in the Quark 7 presentation in November, and the introductory/upgrade pricing was very very low – something like AUS $1500  – but it appears that this is all happening too late to win any market share back. This is already having an effect on purchasing decisions at the University; QX is already being discontinued from one of the programmes I teach on.</div>

I was still using PM 6.52 when I converted to OS X and was lucky enough to find the upgrade package to CS1 at my university store in the half-price bin -- as I've been taking Continuing Ed classes, I got the educational deal and managed to make the big jump for $110 Canadian.  

Even with cranking out for the extra memory, buying Acrobat 7 Pro, and folding in the cost of my class, I still saved big bucks.

I'm guessing that it will use more RAM and take longer to load because of new fonts and plugins but I doubt that CPU requirements would go up any any existing areas of the software. Given that one of the big Illustrator CS3 goals is a performance overhaul and that Photoshop CS3 performance is astoundingly faster in many areas it seems likely that Indesign will get some tweaking. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if the tweaking revolves around multithreading exploiting the new x86 chips, so get ready to upgrade.

On the upside, replacing a machine is a lot less expensive now that the Macbook and Mac mini are so fast and so cheap. Sure they suck if you need to do cool 3D stuff, but if all your design is 2D, a $750 Mac mini will run circles around last year's $3000 G5 machines.</div>

Ain't that the truth?  The first Mac I bought was a B/W toaster SE20, came bundled with a 2400 baud modem and cost me $3,000: the second came bundled with a 15" colour monitor and cost, about $2,500; the last one is the last of the G3 graphite iMacs and cost $2,000.

When I upgrade next, I'd be happy to blow $1,500....  ;-)</div>

I could be mistaken, but it's my understanding that every major release of InDesign has been faster than the one before it. The InDesign team pays a *lot* of attention to performance.

Now that is such a big surprise :-)

Actually, HP uses their own flavor PostScript interpreter instead of paying Adobe to use theirs. My money is on Adobe being correct in matching their own apps with their own PostScript. HP is johnny-come-lately to the PostScript party.
