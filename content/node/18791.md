  caracter sets and the differences between the mac and pc platform, hopefully now
  opentype fonts are out and things are made more simple. Is there a way to be able
  to see the full set of typefaces of an opentype, true type, type1 font so when the
  time comes to create my own, to put them in the right order!\r\nAm i making sense?"
