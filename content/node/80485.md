  based on the logotype on that B-52's album.\r\n\r\nIt's a chromatic face, and one
  of the fonts is probably going to have to have some really complex shapes because
  it's intended to simulate a texture.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b_4336.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  this totally impractical? I remember seeing some novelty fonts over the years that
  looked really complex. I just hope it doesn't totally sabotage someone's computer
  to have to load all these shapes.\r\n\r\nThanks all."

  body: Thanks to Opentype it's not impractical. There are many effects that you can
    do now, including complex shapes and textures. As long as apps are OT savvy it
    will work fine. At least there are some things that make it great to be living
    in 2011.

  body: There's one called <a href="http://www.dafont.com/romantiques.font">Romantiques</a>
    over on DaFont, which is rather complicated and takes a while to raster on screen
    at least in Windows Font Viewer.

  body: With OpenType and the power and colors available on computers these days,
    I don't see why your font should be a problem. It might be difficult to read though.
