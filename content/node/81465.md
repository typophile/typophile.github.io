body: "I'm trying to code my opentype features in the most efficient way, but not
  sure about what order they need to go in.\r\n\r\nHere's what I'm trying to achieve
  using dlig and salt.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opentypeligs_6336.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  first line is what appears by default, using just <code>liga</code>. The f has a
  slightly shorter hood.\r\n\r\nSecond, the only difference is the descender, this
  should be a stylistic set.\r\n\r\nThird, using <code>dlig</code>, the crossbar or
  hood joins onto the next glyph.\r\n\r\nFourth, if we want descending and joining
  ligatures, we can apply the stylistic set and the <code>dlig</code> feature.\r\n\r\nCodewise:\r\n\r\n<code>liga</code>
  \r\n#something like\r\nsub f'f' by ff; #where ff is a tweaked composite of two fs.\r\n#etc
  for other ligs\r\n\r\n<code>ss01</code>\r\n#sub f' [b f h i j k l t] by f.alt; #where
  f.alt is the descending version.\r\n#plus some other substition to fix the double
  f ligs.\r\n\r\n<code>dlig</code>\r\nsub f' f' by f_f; #where f_f is the connected
  variant\r\n#etc for other ligs\r\n\r\nNow where do I stick the code that applies
  when both ss01 and dlig are applied? In both features? Is my code really messy?"

    later, I would think.

    in the same glyph, I\u2019d say that you need to add some new glyphs to the font.\r\n\u2014You
    could call those new glyphs using another stylistic alternate (ss02)."

  body: "For something like this, my inclination is usually to do the stylistic variation
    first, and then the ligation. Since your ligatures seem to be all variants on
    the common f-ligature, I don't think 'dlig' is appropriate. I would use 'ss01'
    and 'liga', in that order. In other words, the input for the 'liga' feature will
    include output forms from the 'ss01' feature, e.g.\r\n\r\n'ss01'\r\nf -> f.ss01\r\n...\r\n\r\n'liga'\r\nf
    f -> f_f\r\nf.ss01 f.ss01 -> f_f.ss01\r\n...\r\n\r\nWhat you should consider is
    what behaviour would be appropriate if a user has turned on 'ss01' for only part
    of a ligating sequence, i.e. what should happen in 'liga' if the input sequence
    is\r\n\r\nf f.ss01\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nf.ss01 f"

    other ligatures in that image, there are LOTS of them :)\r\n\r\nI'll try what
    you suggest and see what happens. I'll check what happens with the half-and-half
    situation too. Good catch.\r\n\r\nFrode, maybe, is calt on by default? My knowledge
    of this stuff is very patchy! First step is to make some classes to make the code
    neater...back soon."

  body: Calt is on by default in Indesign and Photoshop, but not in Illustrator (at
    least not CS3). The latter is a bug, I think. Although for me it is on for some
    wierd reason.

    everyone!\r\n\r\nJohn, by the way, if the features are applied to one part of
    a sequence, all of it stays as the default glyphs. Not sure what would be best
    in that instance, and also where would the code go?"

    could you please post the code you finally used? This way it would be easier to

    was also slightly wondering if the non-connected forms of fi should appear in
    a contextual alternate feature, but not sure why that would be better so left

    to put things in, is whether the feature is on or off by default, and whether
    the user will be confused or comfortable with the groupings of alternates together
    in a single feature....\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nT"
