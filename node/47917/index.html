  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello, everyone! I&rsquo;ve just finished a blitzkrieg of digitization, completing two ASCII character sets in two weeks. The result is Solvejg (&ldquo;soul-veyg&rdquo;, for the Scandinavianly-impaired). I welcome critique, especially considering how fast I blazed through the production. Attached is a PDF sample. I hope you enjoy it&hellip;even the song lyrics I typed in at the end because they were stuck in my head.</p>
<p>UPDATED 4 May 09. New PDF added (NewSolvejgText.pdf); new post written below.</p>
<p>Slightly RE-UPDATED 7 May 09. After printing out the sample for myself I decided to make a few small changes. Flattened the bottom of the esses some, and made the roman t less cartoony. Replaced previous sample with SolvejgTextNew.pdf.</p>
<p>UPDATED AGAIN 2 May 10. And about time: I finally finished Solvejg Black; I&rsquo;m hoping to have this ready for distribution within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The proportions seem forced into eccentricity. The top bowl looks like a squinting eye, very tight, while the bottom bowl drips down like a giant hanging tear, very loose. How would it look to enlarge the top bowl a bit and give more structure to the s-shaped line that comes down to form the right side of the lower bowl?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nathanael,</p>
<p>I looked at the gif embedded in the thread, showing the s in context. It&rsquo;s just light. In the overall context, the change you&rsquo;ve made is infinitesimal and barely perceptible. look at that gif and how heavy the 2 i&rsquo;s look on either side.</p>
<p>The top and bottom of s are also the lightest features, tapering off to &lsquo;hairline&rsquo; thickness where everything else has either a flared stroke terminal or a horizontal feature. So the s looks like it is too short/small, and it also is lighter overall than the others. This is an example of the trickery necessary to get straight, flaring strokes to look visually the same weight as bowls. They can&rsquo;t all be the same weight in the middle.</p>
<p>The s is also one of the narrowest shapes in the lot, making it look that much smaller. Your r has this problem too, but it also has a standard flaring vertical stem. In any size less than display, I could see the r turning into an i.</p>
<p>The wide range of widths or proportions can be toyed with in display fonts, but you&rsquo;ll find as you try to use this, that text faces have a narrower range of proportion that still allows reading to occur smoothly.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t said what this design is intended for. It&rsquo;s very interesting, as is your other work, but did you have a brief or purpose in mind?</p>
<p>In overall style, I think some things need to be more related: the exaggerated eyes of g, high waist of k, narrow s and r and some of the tapers lean in a comical, display direction. But the eyes of a and e, which are central shapes to a Latin design, are more conventional and sensible, as are the simple, classic proportions of h, p, o, i, B and W. So there&rsquo;s a dilemma: Make it all more goofy, or all more sensible and conventional? A brief might help with this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t have any specific use in particular in mind so far&ndash;when I draw fonts, I tend to just come up with an idea and then sketch it out, thinking about the letters themselves rather than the future of the font. That&rsquo;s somewhat a poor way to approach the font, and it&rsquo;s resulted in some far-reaching changes in the past. In my sketches of Newt, the ascenders are impractically high. Most of the fonts I&rsquo;ve designed are serif text faces, and such is the case with both the other ones I&rsquo;ve put up here (Cyril and Newt), so I&rsquo;ve never really had the problem of unclear purpose before.</p>
<p>I think I want to make Solvejg usable for somewhat long text. I&rsquo;m realizing that it might be a good idea to make a display version of it and a milder text version. But, I think I will make the g, k, s, and r as you mentioned work better with the (more &ldquo;sensible&rdquo;) rest of the font. However, I&rsquo;m afraid if I normalize them too much I&rsquo;ll lose character. I guess I&rsquo;ll save the most flamboyant ideas for the display version.</p>
<p>Thanks&ndash;it helped to get clearer about Solvejg&rsquo;s purpose.</p>

<p>Sorry for my English :-)
I meant that it has a certain style. More classic, a bit handwritten (even if not exactly), things like that.
Those things that in a certain way seem to have sweapt away the futuristic style move form the beginning of 2000.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t suggest either direction particularly; you have a choice. But you can do some tests with copies of your current working file, pushing each one in different directions. It might help you decide which direction is the right one. It might turn out that the whole thing needs to be more quirky and clownish, but the best way to know is to try it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t place a higher value on &ldquo;sensible&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s just a descriptive term.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t started the display version, but when I find the time it shouldn&rsquo;t take too long, since it&rsquo;ll be pretty close to what I had before. Meanwhile, I wonder what everyone thinks of Solvejg Text. I&rsquo;ve attached a new pdf up above (NewSolvejgText.pdf).</p>
<p>Things I&rsquo;ve changed: I made all the hairlines sturdier. I widened the S and s distinctly (they look good to me now, but I welcome criticisms, of course). I lengthened the beak of the r, and made the top bowl of the g a little taller. In the italic I fixed some imbalance I was sensing on the bottom of the g. I also fixed various little things that I didn&rsquo;t commit to memory.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks. Eliason, I&rsquo;m really hesitant about changing the stress on the Zz, because of something to do with my hairlines. In Solvejg I&rsquo;ve got hairlines that taper away, like on E and L, but they all come from a line that&rsquo;s perpendicular to them, and I don&rsquo;t think I like the idea of one of those coming from an angle like it would in Zz. I made such a Zz anyhow. I also made a d with a kickstand, but I&rsquo;m not sure I like it. You did, however, make me think about my Zz, which was a letter I hadn&rsquo;t thought about much, and I realized it was in fact jarring. I tweaked it some to try and reduce that. Here are new letters.
<img src="/images/old-images/allpurposetemp_4832.PNG" alt="">
1: Old d, tweaked z with same stress.
2: Old d, old z.
3: d with kickstand, z with switched stress.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/allpurposetemp2_4340.PNG" alt="">
1: Old Z.
2: Tweaked Z with same stress.
3: Z with switched stress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just noticed: I should probably bring the top bar of whichever Z I pick farther left. 
Thoughts?</p>

<p>I believe I&rsquo;m getting close to done with this font. But before I talk business with people, I want to get opinions on how it looks, so it&rsquo;s not just my one set of still fairly inexperienced eyes going over it. So, I&rsquo;ve attached a new pdf (SolvejgDecember) up top for review. PLease let me know what you think of pretty much anything about the font. In particular, the most recent changes are in kerning and the letters I mention in the pdf&ndash;the g and the s, though there may have been other tweaks that I&rsquo;ve lost track of. Thanks for any comments!</p>

<p>This is pretty interesting, and I think is promising in terms of potential sales. But its suitability for &ldquo;long text&rdquo; (expressed on Aug. 7/08) I have to doubt, personally.</p>
<p>Some of the glyphs, like &ldquo;s&rdquo;, &ldquo;k&rdquo; anfd &ldquo;g&rdquo;, are highly charming. Others -like the &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo;- I personally don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>The Bold is nicely tame, which makes it usable in running text. On the other hand, this design seems to be crying for some juice really dark weights, no?</p>
<p>The italic makes me uncomfortable, frankly. By itself it looks great* but in its main role, all it makes me think of is: Mutiny! :-/  The thing is, I&rsquo;m not sure how to fix it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe even better than the Roman!
That Bold Italic is especially luscious.</li>

<p>Sounds like you both think Solvejg would look pretty good with a weight gain. It would be a fair amount of more work, but I also have some time (for once), so I might be able to deal with making a new weight. I suppose I could cook up a quick sample of something bold sometime soon and see how it looks and post it here.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular about a and y that you don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>I can sense a bit of a disconnect between the roman and the italic, too, but I&rsquo;m at a similar place&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any way to fix it, especially without losing the character that the italic has taken on, which, it sounds like we agree, is pretty nice. When I post again I&rsquo;ll put up some text with roman and italics mixed for assessing how well they collaborate.</p>
<p>Thanks for the vote of confidence on the bold italic. I always feel the shakiest designing that weight, I guess since it&rsquo;s always extrapolated the farthest away from my original ideas. Also thanks to eliason; hard not to enjoy general compliments.</p>
<p>Always liked your pangram/metagram. It shows up in most of my samples, actually.</p>

<p>What a long design process. I think I&rsquo;m finally just about done with the pixel pushing. Here, in SolvejgInMay.pdf at the top, is the latest in my efforts to make Solvejg happen. A new weight, and a slight refiguring of the old Display weight to make it finer and more Displayey. I&rsquo;m anxious to get this font <cite>finished</cite>, but I do want some eyes besides mine to see it before I start negotiations, so I turn to you, Typophiles. How do you like it? Is there stuff that I should fix? Do you want the old bold weight to still be available? Let me know any thoughts you have.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I&rsquo;m not sure what happened to the math symbols in the Text Italic. I&rsquo;ll fix that at some point. The Display Italic might have the same issue but I didn&rsquo;t put its math symbols in the sample originally because they were the same as the Roman&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>By the way, the name Solvejg is usually written with an i (Solveig). Solvejg is so uncommon, at least to me, that I first mistook it for a typo. I had to look up the phone directory, which returned nine hits in Norway (“Solveig” returned 17705). It’s a lovely name nevertheless. Makes me think of blonde farmergirls amongst deep fjords and majestic mountains. The English translation would be something like “a sunny road”.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Huh. I think the (Roman) &ldquo;g&rdquo; is beautiful, and central to the charming feel of the font. I&rsquo;d definitely keep that.</p>
<p>Really nice work! Great to see you&rsquo;re still working on it. The Roman makes me want to use it for a children&rsquo;s book with great illustrations. I&rsquo;m not quite as convinced about the angularity and heightened contrast of the Italic (especially in the &ldquo;g&rdquo; actually), it&rsquo;s a strange way of contrasting with the Roman, but not sure what to suggest. :-\</p>
<p>A couple of details:</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with Craig about making the &ldquo;s&rdquo; a bit looser, so it doesn&rsquo;t get swallowed up too much.</li>
<li>Overall, the spacing seems not bad but is still rather uneven.</li>
<li>I also wonder about the Roman &ldquo;e&rdquo; – maybe it&rsquo;s a bit deflated/lazy/soft too (compared to the angularity of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;)? But maybe there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m not getting.</li>
<li>And your c-cedilla isn&rsquo;t merged (white overlap visible).</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If there&rsquo;s a disagreement among the learnèd, I suppose I&rsquo;ll err on the side of my original intentions (and doing less work) and keep my roman &ldquo;g&rdquo; as it is. I agree, the sidebearings of the &ldquo;s&rdquo; need to be loosened up, and I&rsquo;ll get on that. For the rest of the spacing, what are bad spots that caught your eye? By now it&rsquo;s hard for me to tell.</p>
<p>People seem to talk about the italic and the roman being mismatched. I can see that too, to an extent. But everyone also says they don&rsquo;t know what to do about it, and I don&rsquo;t either. I could try approaching it sort of like Joanna, with arches not pointed and hairlines joining stems near the top, but it just seems like it would be a lot weaker-looking, and have nowhere near as much character. And I also don&rsquo;t think just rounding off the arches would work—the only way I can see it going with that change is a sort of Palatino style, and I don&rsquo;t think that would work right. I&rsquo;ll mock up some text with the italics and roman mixed and put that up here—maybe they&rsquo;ll look better together if you can see them harmonizing? Another thing is that the thought of redesigning all three italic lowercases fills me with dread.</p>
<p>I can probably make the &ldquo;e&rdquo; more angular to match the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. Also, as far as the &ldquo;ç&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve got pretty much all my composite characters still composite in the font—I haven&rsquo;t merged the contours. Is that something that&rsquo;s normally done? I remember from opening up Gentium that almost all its letters were made up of little movable pieces. I just never seem to be able to get mine all to stop showing white overlap spaces, even after telling TypeTool to point all the contours in the proper Type1 way.</p>

<p>The Italic is more of a distant relative than a cousin or sibling, I find this to be positive and quite unique actually. You got two companion typefaces that have great potential of complementing each other in a composition.
This doesn&rsquo;t occur in the PDF but maybe an Italicized word within a sentence may look odd to some people, well you can always include a Demibold for emphasis, and that&rsquo;ll make Hrant happy.</p>

<p>I believe I&rsquo;m about 99% done with this font, which is exciting. Before I call it done, though, I want to put up a bit of something I made tonight, showing the roman and italic mixed. I think they do okay together; how about you? It&rsquo;s called Hamlet.pdf, in the list at the top. If anyone has any other concerns, let me know. As long as they&rsquo;re not about kerning, because I was using Inkscape and couldn&rsquo;t kern, and thus this is kerned horribly.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S. Forgot to mention other things. I squared off the &ldquo;e&rdquo; a little, and loosened the spacing around the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, since last time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you were asking for any feedback but I think the Hamlet layout doesn&rsquo;t need to be so &lsquo;jumpy&rsquo; as your type already has so much flair! So many point sizes distract from displaying your careful attention to the weight. I&rsquo;d avoid using this as a sample for that reason.</p>
