body: Appreciate any suggestions for a font that would approximate the font which
  appears in this sign.  It&#39;s from my Grandfathers &#40;actually Great grandfathr&#39;s
  store in VT&#41;, built in late 1800.  One very helpful fellow from What&#39;s This
  Font? suggested  the sign was probably done by hand, and rather poorly at that!  <BR>  <BR>Just
  need an approxomation for a family reunion next month. <BR> <BR>Thank&#39;s for
  any and all assistance. <BR> <BR>Penny<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40389.jpg"

  body: Psy/Ops has a font called <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_krasivyi.html"
    target="_blank">Krasivyi</a>, whose italic is similar to your sample. It was a
    rather random pick of a squarish serif that might look like an old typeface. I
    am sure there would be other choices.

    Have I asked this before?
