    was way off of course. BTW, can I get an outline version of page 27? It rules,
    especially with that shading.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I didn't create these. All I have is a folder of PNG, GIF, and JPG files.\r\n\r\nI
    debated about removing the Frutiger image. There were a few that were even more
    tasteless than that which I did remove. I don't agree with it at all. Part of
    the humor, for me, was the fact that <em>it is</em> so off.\r\n\r\nBFF4likeEVER
