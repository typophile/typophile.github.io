  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m working on my first book for children (with the text integrated in the full-page illustrations - usually, the illustration has left room for the text with a uniform colour or texture of some sort).</p>
<p>I might have more of these kind of jobs, so I&rsquo;m on the lookout for fonts suitable for children&rsquo;s books (both display and text-fonts). I searched the forum, but it seems that nobody has discussed this before, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what people think about it.</p>
<p>A personal preference: I wouldn&rsquo;t like to stereotypical fonts that could risk &ldquo;talking down&rdquo; to the children. In other words, being <em>too</em> childish. Also, I&rsquo;m aware that the suitability of any font depends on the specific story, but my goal here is just to brainstorm away and create a whole bunch of inspiration!</p>
<p>Would <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=bello&id2=smallcaps">Bello</a> in small caps work for display text? My intuition tells me it would suit for young boys.</p>
<p>Thank you!

<p>What do you guys think of Zalamander for children&rsquo;s books by the way?</p>
<p>Personally I would want to use quirky serifs, like Pattyfab suggested. I think I found all the ones you listed, but I find it difficult to visualize them in print, from just looking at the screen. I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/della-robbia|Della Robbia]] though (maybe because the serifs are so neutral), [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Belucian|Belucia]] seems a bit too sophisticated for most purposes and I don&rsquo;t know what to think about [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-oneleigh/regular/|OneLeigh]]..</p>
<p>Chaparral was a really good idea! That could end up as a standard children&rsquo;s font for me. Thanks. I couldn&rsquo;t find Goudy California(n), but Garamond 3 and [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Hightower|Hightower]] seem a bit too traditional. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eldorado|Eldorado]] looked interesting (especially the lower-case &lsquo;a&rsquo;), but I think I need to see more of it (in print preferably).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>Thanks for the input. I guess your argument is similar to those in the thread on &ldquo;gay types&rdquo;: there&rsquo;s no point in finding a generic type, without considering the content. I have to say though, I&rsquo;m certainly not looking for a catch-all type, but rather stirring up some inspiration – and now, apparently, debate :)</p>
<p>Put simply, first I want to familiarize myself with a whole lot of different types suitable for children&rsquo;s book (a generalization: assuming that children&rsquo;s books have <em>something</em> in common, and are more similar than, say scientific journals), which will make it much more fun to pick a specific one for a specific book (by considering its specific subject).</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be either-or. You can work both generalizing and specific, by making a preselection.</p>
<p>But what do I know, I&rsquo;m a child in this business anyway</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>MondoB, that looks interesting, thanks for the suggestion. I will check it out.</p>
<p>Apparently, Underware fonts seem to do a lot of what I personally look for. 
– A colleague of mine actually used Sauna for the new danish edition of the Bible for children. 
– I <em>love</em> the look of Dolly, and have waited for an occasion to use it, so maybe I should put that on my childrens-list. Actually, I have considered Auto (another Underware font) for this particular job, because it seems to complement Chaparral very well (I discovered this in another thread here on the forum – I think it was a comment by crossgrove there too, so I might as well say thank you <em>twice</em>)</p>
<p>After thinking about the subject of finding &ldquo;children&rsquo;s fonts&rdquo;, I may have to accept that I am rather strongly selecting fonts from a personal aestaethic viewpoint. I&rsquo;m definately not going for the neutral and don&rsquo;t-see-me-fonts, because I want the look of the text to compliment and &ldquo;play&rdquo; with the illustrations (though not necessarily in the &ldquo;clever&rdquo; way EK mentions). But I may have a slight bias towards certain kinds of fonts. I don&rsquo;t know if this is bad or good.</p>

I&rsquo;ll remember that next time I see the Duck Confit Happy Meal at McDonalds&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think typographers/graphic designers should be afraid to play with typefaces, as long as the point size, leading (you&rsquo;re right EK), and legibility (none of those random cursive characters or such) are not affected. Take for instance, comic books. There you will have an excellent balance of type to image (and also the only time center-alligned paragraphs are acceptable) where there is in no way any indication of classic typography. Depending on the age group, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to use a &ldquo;handwritten&rdquo; sans in a children&rsquo;s book, as long as it&rsquo;s still legible, and makes sense in it&rsquo;s usage. Maybe if they&rsquo;re a little older we can go to JK Rowling&rsquo;s 12pt Adobe Garamond (at least for us in the US).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A number of children&rsquo;s picture books use type which is very unsympathetic to the art. Putting brittle type next to or over painted art looks ugly to me. For <A HREF="http://www.sadiethepilot.com">my own first book</A> I used a version of Cooper Oldstyle. The blobby serifs went very well with the acrylic painting, I thought. Where the designer and editor suggested setting some of the type along curves, I created a new upright cursive non-joining font, which being my first I make no great claims for, but it was better than having serifs choo-chooing up and down curves, which is something that looks weird to me, unless it&rsquo;s handlettered.</p>
<p>I handlettered the cover letters, which led to some problems on foreign co-editions. Where I got the chance I created hand-lettering for co-editions also, but most of them were typeset, not always in the most pleasing way.</p>
<p>My current project is a Dutch language only picture book, which I intend to handletter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also working on another English language book where I plan to follow Maurice Sendak and use Cheltenham, mixing and matching the versions from a couple of suppliers so that I can get as traditional a &lsquo;g&rsquo; as possible, and also approximate smallcaps by using a bold at a smaller size. I may have to draw that old &lsquo;r&rsquo; myself, though. I can&rsquo;t see it for sale anywhere, nor can I see an &lsquo;ffi&rsquo; for &lsquo;traffic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fond of Baskerville with art, as seen in the Danish children&rsquo;s comic <A HREF="http://airforceamazons.blogspot.com/2008/02/antlerism.html">Rasmus Klump</A>.</p>
<p>Counter to all this, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=lauren+child&Go.x=0&Go.y=0&Go=Go">Lauren Child</A> uses type in a way that is extremely ugly, but integrates with the art perfectly, and is in its own philistine way absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>I agree with your policy, but not the rationale.
IMO, traditional serif faces have the most interesting letterforms, ideal for engaging young minds.
Kellie mentions Cheltenham, which has a few &ldquo;extra&rdquo; serifs and unusual top-heavy proportions.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t design Fontesque for children, but that&rsquo;s a genre it&rsquo;s often used for.
Designers, perhaps, use its bounce and irregularity to signal the genre, being similar to the uneven quality of children&rsquo;s handwriting. Children also seem to like it; I think because it breaks the grid. They&rsquo;re always being told to conform, which is hard work, so they respond to something that doesn&rsquo;t. This isn&rsquo;t the same issue as &ldquo;serious/fun&rdquo;, although there is some overlap. It is also possible for children to be serious and non-conformist at least some of the time&ndash; after all, that&rsquo;s learning to think for oneself.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well thought out, Nick. I think that&rsquo;s a very inspiring explanation for which fonts children most often like (though, you have to admit, the mere explanation of such a thing is a generalization. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a bad thing though)</p>
<p>On a general note, I have to add that <em>not all children&rsquo;s book are read by children</em>. A lot of them are read by their parents. This affects the whole discussion of traditional type vs. expressive type. In the case of a book where most children don&rsquo;t read themselves, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate in using an expressive type. With my particular book as an example: the text is disproportionally difficult in relation to the age-relevance of the theme and the style of the artwork. If the child could read it, he/she would probably be turned of by the theme and the artwork, and go read a more serious book.</p>
<p>William: The illustration style of the book is rather wild, &ldquo;pointy&rdquo; and non-smooth. But also friendly and cuddly (especially the huge black dog, which the protagonist finds in his daddy&rsquo;s car instead of his dad). I chose Chaparral, because I seemed to get some of the same vibes from this font.</p>

Especially if your audience is younger kids, just learning to read. Don&rsquo;t pick fancy or decorative fonts. At the museum, we were very specific to using only fonts with infant characters (round a&rsquo;s and g&rsquo;s) because those are what children recgonize best. Some are:</p>
<p>Futura
Century Gothic
Andika Basic (I think this was designed especially for children): <a href="http://www.dafont.com/andika-basic.font">http://www.dafont.com/andika-basic.font</a>
Gill Sans Infant</p>
<p>There are probably others. I also had a MFA Graduate classmate who did a thesis on typography in children&rsquo;s books. Again, consistency and legibility are the most important things.</p>
