    you post them, right? If you don\u2019t actually plan on starting a discussion
    just post these to a blog instead of cluttering the forums."

    all. I don't mind at all that he posts them. In fact, Thanks, Chris. What do you
    think of Mr. Black calling type designers a scrappy bunch? :o)\r\n\r\n& What clutter?
    \ Are you kidding? Some posts on the first page of this forum are over 6 days
    old. "

  body: "@ Russell: \"<em>What do you think of Mr. Black calling type designers a
    scrappy bunch</em>?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a clear definition of what Roger Black means
    by \"scrappy\" it's difficult to say. <strong>If</strong>, for the sake of our
    discussion, I define \"scrappy\" as \"having a tendency to argue and have confrontations
    amongst themselves\" we can find proof of that in almost any thread (including
    this one). The opposite is also true (of which there is evidence within this thread
    as well). Given this, I cannot agree with Roger Black's statement. \r\n\r\nAgain,
    this is based on my definition of the term \"scrappy.\" Roger may have meant something
    entirely different. I was not there, so I cannot take his statement out of context.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I have not read everything on this subject, I have received personal correspondence
    from him regarding Ready-Media and found him to be both forthcoming and polite."

    comment is clearly valid about Roger's tastes on his own projects. Roger has always
    had a strong brand identity for himself through type.\r\n\r\nHaving worked for
    over 20 years with Roger on projects for other identities, I think it should be
    clear from the breadth of Font Bureau's, and now Webtype's offerings, that we
    do not, like a good dog, stay.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

    that Roger Black isn't African-American.\r\nGo figure.\r\n\r\n(And Chris can post
    all the links to items that he thinks will be of interest that he wants as far
    as I'm concerned. Dunwich very cranky, not scrappy.)\r\n"

    of duplication or excess is surely acceptable. Sitting there thinking \u201CEverybody
    else has already read this\u201D is a great way to ensure that people who should
    read it but haven\u2019t won\u2019t."
