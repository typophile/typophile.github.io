  body: According to [[http://www.wired.com/images/press/pdf/avatarCameron.pdf|this
    PDF]], that should be TrickMono. Even after further investigation, I wasn't able
    to get any more information on this TrickMono (may be a bespoke typeface designed
    by Hoefler & Frere Jones as almost everything at Wired Magazine).
