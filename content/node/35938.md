body: "Today is was at a museum in Terschuur: http://www.ambachtenmuseum.nl/\r\nThe
  owner collects a huge variety of old tools, etc and puts everything in the museum.
  It is pretty messy, but one is allowed to touch things (gently) and that makes a
  visit worthwhile. \r\nI found something in \"the printing corner\" which seemed
  pretty interesting for anyone here, but I'm not sure what it is and where it came
  from, but it says 'Lettergieterij Ensched\xE9'. Some kind of frontpage for a typespecimen?
  Any other ideas?\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: I reduced size of the pictures and added another:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TEFF_01_4102.jpg]<br>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TEFF_02_6369.jpg]<br>"

    seems to be a listing of type specimens.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just realized it is only
    a listing of faces but not in the type itself. Anyone who speaks Dutch might be
    able to figure out what kind of firm used it."

    you wouldn't put your phone number in the middle of a front cover, would you?
    Still, funny idea, printing the names of all those faces in Spectrum. (The bottom
    line means \"Set in Jan van Krimpen's Spectrum\".) Reminds me of the thread with
    the poster for the Helvetica film set in Trajan:)"

    is on the right (unused, or cleaned exceptionally well).\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was
    a printshop advertising it's catalog of available faces. The limited number (to
    our eyes) is probably about right when one had to buy lead type, or lino matricies. "

    of plastic and there were other examples, but in worse state.\r\nOn the right
    is made of lead. The was another piece there, but it was broken.\r\n\r\nTEFF is
    one of Hollands \"top\" font foundries. Their quality has always been high and
    still is. The museum is more like a secondhand-shop... Strange...\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know the book? Could it have to do with 'embossing'?\r\n\r\nI only found
    some names via Google, no images (bookcovers):\r\n<em>Spectrum Romulus Lutetia
    Romanee Open Kapitalen. Lettergieterij Joh. Enschede en Zonen. Haarlem, Holland.
    z.j. or.omsl. Rijk geillustreerd.</em>"

  body: "Here is another edition, from the 70s. So it seems this one should also be
    from a font specimen. BTW, I believe the historical Ensched\xE9 Foundry is now
    defunct. The name was resurrected by the new, up-upmarket, digital foundry (and
    the quality, but with new fonts).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new5_4552.jpg]"

    heer,\r\nHet linker deel is een zogenoemde \"afpersing\" van los zetsel in een
    speciaal soort hard papier, een soort \"Prespan\" en dient om daaruit een clich\xE9
    te gieten. Het clich\xE9, rechts, wordt dan gebruikt voor de druk, in dit geval
    vermoedelijk voor een advertentie.\r\nHopend u hiermee iets verder geholpen te
    hebben,\r\nMet vriendelijke groet,\r\n\r\n[removed name]\r\nConservator Museum
