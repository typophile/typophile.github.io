  by fontshop.com? My main problem on choosing fonts is a visual reference and this
  seem a nice tool. Looking at font on screen can tend to be tedious and evetually
  they look all the same &#40;as a friend of mine theory where the fonts are all like
  Times new Roman and Arial&#41;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I have it and it&#39;s the best font reference I&#39;ve ever seen <BR>or used.
    There are more fonts than any other current <BR>specimen book and they are properly
    shown with handy <BR>cross-references for typefaces of similar styles. Buy it.

    in the FontBook, and  <BR>although it&#39;s more than 5 years old, it still is
    an  <BR>invaluable reference tool. The perfect companion to  <BR>it might well

    which I unfortunately  <BR>don&#39;t own yet'

  body: Indie-Fonts is a great resource and would be a welcome addition to anyone&#39;s
    graphics/typography library.  It&#39;s been very helpful in identifying and selecting
    fonts from smaller independent foundries.
