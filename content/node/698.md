  body: Andrij, I don&#39;t speak Russian, but I have understood some of your post
    anyway &#40;you know - we&#39;re the same Slavic tribe&#41;. Personally I see
    a nice connection of microphone and hiphop. Yes, of course it is from another
    era, but I don&#39;t find hiphop very high-tech. I think the vinyls &#40;which
    are from some previous era too&#41; and microphones match perfectly with a hiphop
    image.  <BR> <BR>Dmitry - I like the logo, but I think you should give some of
    the roughness of the type to the microphone, too. That is why I like the 1.2A
    most, but it is still too soft and computerised for my eye. Hip hop has never
    been a soft politicaly correct music style, was it?

  body: It&#39;s called rap.ru? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not crazy about the color on its
    own, but it would look good with the right other colors in the design. <BR> <BR>One
    thing the logotype reminds me of is TV news reporters. You know, the ones with
    the mics with the little &#34;NBC&#34; signs on them?  <BR> <BR>I like the bottom
    one the best.

  body: Yeah, really nice logo.. my favourite is nr. 1c ;&#41; <BR> <BR>but i think
    the green color is too boring for an hiphop ezine. try an yelow/red color combination

    I spend only 2 hours &#40;from drawin sketch till this preview&#41; on this logo.
    thats why its soft an green<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#40;also this chars in &#34;rap.ru&#34; is too simple&#41;..
    <BR> <BR> <BR>So, about tha mic.. Tha domain name is &#34;rap.ru&#34; and its
    a problem for me, because rap is only a part of hiphop culture. so if i&#39;ll
    drew a turntable, for example, it will keep logical connection&#40;between domain
    name and image&#41;, but if i&#39;ll drew spray can - i think it will not..  <BR>&#40;2ANDRIJ&#62;&#62;

  body: i like tags that you used in first options &#40;1.x&#41; because in second
    options &#40;2.x&#41; i dont see RAP letters. i like &#39;X dot&#39; more than
    &#39;STAR dot&#39; <BR> <BR>would you use tags of first option without &#39;micro&#39;?
    it&#39;s more simple and effective i think <BR> <BR>&#40;sorry my english&#41;

  body: I quite like the second series. It might be the roughness I was writing about
    in my previous post. There is of course a lack of legibility, but I think that
    the pure form might become significant enough &#40;especially 2a&#41;. Well...
    the microphones weren&#39;t that bad anyway.

  body: Dmitry, maybe im stating the obvious, but have you tried doing the lettering
    with spraypaint and then photographing it? I think doing this way would capture
    street flavor better. <BR> <BR>The R in the 2nd set is turning into a B. <BR>
    <BR>my two cents. <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: I am in the throes of designing a poster for a hip hop festival in my home
    town. I have done what andrew suggested above and sprayed it. It just feels a
    lot better than vector art. But maybe that is quite appropriate for an e-zine.  <BR>
