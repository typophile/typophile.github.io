body: This is a subject I've been fascinated with since my freshman year of design
  school, after writing a paper about Matthew Carter and his work like Bell Centennial
  for phone books, Verdana for the screen, and Olympian for newspapers. I'd love to
  learn more about typefaces like this that have been designed to perform in really
  specific settings. Anyone know of any examples?

    em units, which is a lot compared to most fonts. But during production I decided
    to make additional weights, since the forms started to look very interesting.\r\n\r\nHere's

    would probably count on two fronts - designed for coding and for ClearType. Which
    kind of leads one to consider OCR A and B - fonts designed to be read by computers
    as well as humans, and maybe code 39 barcodes - fonts designed to be read just
    by computers :-)"
