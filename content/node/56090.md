  Armory art show: http://blog.myfonts.com/401\r\n\r\nThere are some examples I note
  there which I'm guessing are indeed typefaces, but I can't identify which ones.
  Stewf seemed at a loss as well when I quickly ran them under his nose. If anyone
  has any insight, please feel free to share it in the comments there.\r\n\r\nThanks
  ahead of time!"

    Bitstream Arrus (or at least that's closer than Trajan).\r\n\r\nIt might be easier
    for you to post the questions over on this List, because there's a lot to sift
    through to find your questions over on the blog page. (One post for each question,
    please).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
