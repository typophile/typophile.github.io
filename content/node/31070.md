body: "Christmas may be over but you might just think about treating yourself to a
  post holiday present (or Groundhog\u2019s Day is soon approaching). Indie Fonts
  3 is just off the press and begging for a slot on your bookshelf. Chock full with
  1,900 fonts and covering over 400 crisply printed pages, not to mention a CD sampler
  with 53 Indie fonts, Indie3 is like a taste test from your favorite candy store.
  \r\nThe book reminds me of when type samples were a regular treat in your snail-mail
  box. Other than the minor chance of getting a paper-cut, real printed samples were
  healthy food for the typophile\u2019s soul. Indie 3 does that one better by being
  a hard-bound book you can put on your coffee table. It is a smorgasbord meal with
  hearty main courses of text fonts, salads and sides of display faces, and desert
  trays of scripts. All of this from the type design chefs of 20 independent foundries.
  As examples, Tom\xE1s Brousil brings his Dederon and Pavel Teimer\u2019s Teimer
  Antiqua to life on the Suitcase Foundry pages.\r\n\r\nWhether your tastes run towards
  Robbie de Villers fresh  Pippin, Tangy treats from Tomi Haaparanta, Kenn Munk\u2019s
  \ bitmap blackletter Influenza, Jeremy Tankard\u2019s Wayfarer and Kingfisher or
  you like Sparky stuff from David Buck, Walburn or Nicholas from Nick Shinn, Jim
  Rimmer\u2019s Amethyst, Neil Summerour\u2019s Ayumi, or just giggle over Letterhead\u2019s
  sidesplitting print ads, you will find it all dished out here.\r\nMy only quibble
  with the book is Virus Fonts green diagonal stripes under every one of their foundries
  pages. It makes you wonder what the type might look like without the op-art distraction
  behind it.\r\n\r\nTo make finding your font du jour quickly, you get a one-liner
  sample as a reference and full showings with fun presentations from each of the
  participating foundries. The fully indexed book has an \u201CEight is Not Enough\u201D
  foreword by our own Yves Peters and an informative and readable essay on \u201Clearning
  to love the EULA\u201D by Tiffany Wardle. There is also a handy contact list of
  the Indie houses.\r\n\r\nEditors Richard Keglar, James Grieshaber, and Tamye Riggs
  have much to be proud of in this showcase presentation of the work of independent
  typeface designers.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll just bet you can buy the thing at P22 site
  any day now so go feed your \u201Cgotta have it\u201D urges\u2014it\u2019s a thumbs
  up no brainer buy :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    believe that the softcover versions are already at amazon.com.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Indie-Fonts-Compendium-Independent-Foundries/dp/1592533132/sr=8-1/qid=1170685046/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-2616460-8923641?ie=UTF8&s=books\">link
    to US store</a>\r\n\r\nIt should be noted the differences between the softcover
    version available widley through Amazon and other sources, and the hard cover
    version available from the indie-fonts.com site and some of the foundries directly.\r\nEssentially,
    the contents are the same. The hardcover matches the previous 2 books' format
    and has no logos on the front dust jacket.\r\nThe softcover is basically the same
    size as the other books and just a bit less impressive. Either one is worth having,
    but the hardcover is worth the extra few dollars if you already have the first
    two.\r\n"
