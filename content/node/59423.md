body: "Hey guys - \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a nice, big, bold kid friendly font that's
  got something interesting about. Something far more elegant and intriguing than
  say a Comic Sans or a fake Superman/Indiana Jones PC font.\r\n\r\nIf I could give
  you some samples - I would :p Basicaly I'm working on a logo & website for company
  that sells trampolines and want to specifically appear more kid and family friendly.
  \r\n\r\nAny help would be super appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

    stand out more than a font, especially in this context.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm talking
    about the logo more than the entire website. :-)"

  body: "Altaira, \r\n\r\nGood suggestion, but the client made the logo himself and
    said the only real modifications he's willing to allow is the changing of the
    font to the same font I use on the site.\r\n\r\nHe chose to use Bodoni for all
    of his type, which doesn't fit with a kid-friendly concept :p"

    [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrafaceslab/|Neutraface Slab]]? \r\n\r\nI just
    picked it up, and it's very nice... using it in a TV logo that's kinda kid-related."

    I'm a little astonished by the House logo thing. Not that I've used House fonts
    for logos, but that's sort of amazingly shocking. "

  body: Perhaps their strategy is to charge very large corporations extra for using
    their type in a design that will be reproduced over and over again around the
    country and globe. If you want to use the fonts for something small-fry, send
    'em a mail. I bet the price is minimal.

    of their retarded EULA.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a by-the-word reading of their EULA would
    mean that I couldn't convert to paths on a block of text that gets used by a client
    of mine using any House Industries font, because that's selling (or giving) it
    to them. Maybe someone with a stronger education in the EULA process could shed
    some light on what they are trying to restrict here.\r\n\r\nSean Glenn\r\nArt
