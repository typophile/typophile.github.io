  body: "Thanks...I considered Cholla sans but it was somehow too condensed to be
    set in all lowercase (that's just a gut feeling and I am new at this, so  I apologize
    if that does not make sense).\r\n\r\nStainless felt better by comparison so I
    think I will give that one a try. \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your suggestions."
