  body: "I think somebody did something cruel to Futura Extra Bold condensed for the
    S and possibly H, the W is along the lines of Futura Black although the separations
    are wide, while the A is Futura Bold, possibly expanded\r\n{edit \u2013 then again

    have done that to start with. Instead I wasted over an hour looking.\r\n\r\nThanks
