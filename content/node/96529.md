body: "This font is used to teach handwriting in mainland China. The supplied image
  was taken from the People's Education Press (PEP)/Cengage Learning's 7th Grade English
  Textbook \"Go For it!\".  \r\n\r\nI've tried to identify this font myself but haven't
  had any luck. The closest I have come has been the Victorian Handwriting font used
  in some Australian schools. Any help with identification would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI
  don't know if this will be useful information but apparently the textbook is based
  on an original text by David Nunan (also titled \"Go For it!\") published in 1999
  by Heinle & Heinle Publishers in Boston."
