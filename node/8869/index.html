		<div class="commentbody">Bert, <BR> <BR>Gotta disagree with you there.  Those fonts you suggested look like they belong on the front of a kids little league shirt &#40;haha&#41; <BR> <BR>They don&#39;t convey any &#34;edginess&#34; and there is little potential for intertwining them, or adding the little devil tail.  These were specific requirements from the client, which we had to keep in mind when selecting a font. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see any problem with using common typefaces in logo design, as long as they are personalized to the job at hand.  Many well known logos use popular typefaces which are just modified.  Look at the letters in logos like Pepsi, Jurassic Park, The Crocodlie Hunter, Honda, or Playboy magazine, just to name a few.   <BR> <BR>From a psychological marketing viewpoint, I think there are advantages to using familiar letterforms, particularly in logo design, as the public sees something different, yet familiar.  Going for the obscure or radical isn&#39;t always best.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, <BR> <BR>Margo Chase&#39;s clients have budgets in the thousands &#40;if not tens of thousands&#41; of dollars.  My guess is, they can afford whatever they want. <BR> <BR>In this case, we weren&#39;t hired to create a marketing campaign, or educate our client about the impact of a logo design on sales.  They had a trade show.  We had a week to work, and a few hundred dollars to spend.  That precluded going through numerous incarnations. <BR> <BR>There are many directions you can go in when creating a design.  In this case, we showed our client three ideas.  The halo/devil tail turned out to be their favorite.  It was an easy solution, given the limited budget.  I was happy, they were happy.  I hate defering artistic spirit to job constraints, but the reality is, it happens more then it doesn&#39;t.  Will it win a Clio?  No.  Did it solve their problem?  Yes.  Such is the world of production artwork. <BR> <BR>I sincerely appreciate your feedback though.  Thanks.</div>
