body: 'I just saw this article mentioned in the Font Bureau news section, and it doesn''t
  look like anyone has posted it here yet. Titled <a href=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a2fa033e-7ca1-11de-a7bf-00144feabdc0.html>"The
  history of the Times New Roman typeface,"</a> it explains Mike Parker''s claim about
  Starling Burgess being the original designer of TNR and discusses the process behind
  Font Bureau''s <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Starling>Starling</a> in some
  detail. It seems pretty well-informed, with the only obvious mistake I see the common
  one of calling type designers "typographers." The unimaginative headline may be
  a Web abridgment of the original; the <a href=http://joeldullroy.blogspot.com/2009/07/secret-history-of-times-new-roman.html>reporter''s
  blog</a> presents the title as "Fight for a font: The secret history of Times New
  Roman."'
