  with paths that were created by an auto-trace. The glyphs have relatively insane
  numbers of the paths.\r\n\r\nOver the years I have cleaned it up a little here &
  there resulting in a slowly shrinking file size and smoother performance. I've finally
  taken the tie to do a more thorough clean up of the font on on exporting the otf
  & ttf files from FontLab 5.1.4 for mac I noticed that the resulting files are significantly
  bigger that the last revision.\r\n\r\nThe newer version has 20% or so less paths
  & no other intentional changes, no new glyphs etc\u2026. so this should not be the
  case.\r\nI've gone through the font glyph by glyph to verify that it truly does
  have far fewer paths. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas how I might further investigate
  this issue? It is a free font & people like it. The clean up barely changes it's
  appearance at all & is definitely a good thing but my goal is to make the font less
  computationally demanding, not more.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Ok that seems to have worked well. I think I messed up the first step but
    I bumbled through it easy enough.\r\n\r\nHere's the process in more detailed terms
    that might be easier to digest.\r\n\r\n1.) I used FontLab to create a Postscript
    version of the font (ASCII/UNIX Type1 ). This creates 4 files: .pfa, .pfm, .inf,
    .afm \r\n\r\n2.) I downloaded the scripts created by Arno Enslin here: http://typophile.com/node/75834\r\n\r\n3.)
    I removed the .txt extention from the end of the downloaded file so my mac would
    recognize it as a zip file then uncompressed the file & moved into FontLabs standard
    location for macros & scripts located at <code> Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio
    5/Macros </code>\r\n\r\n4.) In FontLab I went to WINDOW>PANELS>EDIT MACROS to
    open the EDIT MACROS window. I dragged the \"Generate_GlyphOrderAndAliasDB_file.py\"
    file into the EDIT MACROS window. The contents of the file appeared in the window.\r\n\r\n5.)
    I hit the RUN MACRO button at the top of the window that looks like a \"play\"
    button. This generated the <code> GlyphOrderAndAliasDB </code> file in the folder
    along with the rest of the type1 font files.\r\n\r\n6.) The font in this example
    was called \"PaintCans\" so I created a plain-text file named <code> FontMenuNameDB
    </code> (no file extension) with the following contents and saved it to the folder
    with the other font files.\r\n<code>[PaintCans]\r\nf=PaintCans\r\ns=Regular\r\nc=PaintCans\r\nc=1,PaintCans</code>\r\n\r\n7.)
    Having the latest Adobe Font Dev Kit for OpenType installed ( [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html|Adobe
    FDKO]] ) I ran the \"makeOTF\" script by opening a terminal window and entering:
    \r\n<code> makeOTF -f c:\\...\\font.pfa -r </code>\r\n\r\nThis all worked like
    a charm and the Adobe makeOTF script spit out an OTF file into the directory with
    the other files.\r\n\r\nThis shaved about 7kb off of the file size which is great.
    I'm not sure why but it's still good.\r\n\r\nI had an original font at 166kb.
    I removed thousands of paths and somehow wound up with a font that was 253kb (bigger
    when I expected smaller). This method did produce a smaller file but only by a
    little bit. I was hoping to understand where all this extra file size had come
    from & to wind up with a new file under 166kb. \r\n\r\nDid I screw it up by using
    FontLab to create the initial Type1 file?\r\n\r\nAny thought on where I might
    go next?"

    I accidentally auto hinted my FontLab file for the old version some time in the
    past\u2026 so I was totally unable to to reproduce the smaller version from the
    original source file. The hinting carried over into the new revision & confusion
    ensued. \r\n\r\nI see now that the OTF  files for the old version have no hinting
    but the FontLab file does. I was looking right past this as I thought I had eliminated
    this possibility. I'm very glad to see it's a simple solution.\r\n\r\nI will add
    that you are still able to get a significantly smaller file through the process
    above than I am. I will investigate that on my own but in any case you are arriving
    at right about the expected file size by removing the hinting & this makes me
    very happy. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate you taking the time to help out with this.
    You have just spared the entire future of the digital world untold millions of

    copy of paintcans_new.otf is now on course to be somewhere between 150k & 168k.
    Now I see I may be able to get it even smaller. Good stuff.\r\n\r\nThis font has
    escaped my control & gets around the internet under it's own power. I've spent
    far more time messing with it over the last several days than I spent making it
    all those years ago. It is an inadvisable way to make a font to say the least
    but it has lead to this great learning experience. \r\n\r\nI made a number of
    path adjustments, kerning adjustments & transformations that make the font a lot
    better from a design perspective so I'm glad I got into this. I'll come back and
    post a final version after I run it through fontforge from step 1 to shave off

    easier to do: when <code>largeside(c)</code> is not larger than 5, decide with

    add contours. Those contours could also be enlarged (with matrix transformations
