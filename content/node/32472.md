  body: Stephen, I couldn't find a link on FontShop nor MyFonts. I did find it under
    <a href="http://www.fontfactory.com">FontFactory</a>. There is also <a href="http://typophile.com/node/2251">an
    old thread on Typophile</a>. Can't seem to find a purchase link I'm afraid...

      on any fonts that were clean & geometric after having used several letter rulers
      in Secondary school. Just loved setting them on paper with a traditional pen!"
