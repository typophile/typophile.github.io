  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, first-timer here, so bear with me.

I attended a lecture by Matthew Carter some time ago where he discussed his method for developing the font Fenway for Sports Illustrated. To satisfy SI's needs, he had to create a font that seemed roomier than Times New Roman, but did not take up any more space. In order to implement this, he used a character chart/map that included a PROPORTIONAL representation of how often each character is used in running text (15 A's, 6 B's, 8 C's, etc.) This allowed him to more accurately determine whether the font was going to take up the right amount of room than typing ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ over and over, as Q, X, and Z are rarely used in running text.

At our magazine, we have been using Gill for years, but want to find another face that looks similar without cutting down our word counts. I've been Googling for an hour and don't seem to be searching for the right thing. Is anyone familiar with where I can find such a character list?

		<div class="commentbody">There used to be such a thing as character count charts, back in the grisly old days of copyfitting. These gave you an average width per character per font per point size, for the most common text fonts. I don't know if one is available online but will take a look.

Have found a picture of one, but it's too small to read (bottom image).

		<div class="commentbody">I have been looking for my old Haberule and Graphics Master in my basement with no luck.  I have not used them in 40 years so that is no surprise.  As Patty said, there were characters-per-pica tables of the more popular typefaces of the time in copyfitting books and even some speciman books.
My suggestion would be to get a known text that fits the space you require and reset it i n several alternates tou your existing typeface to see which fits best.

		<div class="commentbody">That's not a bad suggestion. I may use Identifont or some other font service to find a couple alternates that have similar features and then try from there.

This site is awesome! Thank you all for being so helpful!

		<div class="commentbody">You can also adjust H&Js to make the copy fit better. I have several H&Js I use - tight, normal, and loose. Gill (as discussed in another thread) is not well kerned. If you want a similar look you could try Agenda, Bliss, or Today Sans for example. Flow them in and see how they compare. Of course if you don't already own them that might be a challenge.

Haberule, haven't heard that in awhile. Rubylith anyone?</div>

I also faced such issues, and used LetterMeter to get some clues about where I could spare significant space regarding to the most used letters. This is only valid for one-language setting only, though.</div>
