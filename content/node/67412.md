    Schocken Bible: the Five Books of Moses.]]\r\n\r\nFox also discusses translation
    in depth, and has a separate book on it. He modestly says there's no such thing
    as the perfect or timeless translation.\r\n\r\nI now and then have issues with
    some things in Fox, but its combination of accuracy to the Hebrew and poetry is
    very impressive.  \r\n\r\nI don't agree with Copulsky's critique of Fox--on the
    Google link. I don't find the English awkward, but powerful, in a way more similar
    to the Hebrew than is the King James. \r\n\r\nAnd while Alter's translation and
    especially notes to the Five Books are valuable, I dislike his translation of
    the Psalms, which form me loses its devotional power--the main point of the Psalms.

    take one example. Do you think that 'Sabbath-Ceasing' is the right translation?

    \ \r\n\r\n\r\nHoffman: Everett Fox's 1995 translation The five books of Moses
    gives us \r\n\"Sabbath, Sabbath-Ceasing,\" as though the English translation for
    shabaton must include the English translation for shabat.\r\n\r\n\r\nJPS -1999:
    \ Six days may work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a sabbath of
    complete rest, holy to the Lord;\r\n\r\nJPS- 1916: Six days shall work be done;
    but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord;\r\n\r\nJewish

  body: "I think you need to look at this example in the context of what Fox is doing
    generally, which is to try to have the English reflect same roots and rhythm as
    the Hebrew. Here the repetition of \"sabbath\" reflects the Hebrew \"Shabbat Shabbaton\".
    Fox also does that for the Biblical special construction with doubled verbs, which
    is common in the Bible, so it resonates with a lot of other stuff in the translation,
    including in this sentence. \r\n\r\nSo here is the whole of 31:15 in Fox: \"For
    six days is work to be made, but on the seventh day [is] Sabbath, Sabbath-Ceasing,
    holiness for YHVH, whoever makes work on the Sabbath day is to be put-to-death,
    yes death!\" \r\n\r\nIf you look at the whole of the passage on the Sabbath--from
    31:12-17 you get a quite different and I think more forceful and more accurate
    feeling out of Fox, compared to JPS. You are the native speaker, but to me with
    my limited Hebrew, even the bit I've quoted much better catches the sound and
    force of the Hebrew. If you look at the more traditional translations, they are
    much more sedate, and soften the ringing, celebratory, and stinging tone of the
    Hebrew. In the original you get the urgency and excitement of beginning this new
    idea of Shabbat, and the desperation to get it to function in the society.     \r\n
    \r\nSo you have to look at \"Sabbath-Ceasing\" in the context of the rest--kind
    of like looking at a glyph not on its own, but in the context of words :) The
    fair comparison is the whole of 31:12-17, one translation with another. \r\n\r\nThere
    is the other problem of adding stuff that isn't in the Hebrew, which is a particular
    problem because people tend to take very seriously the English wording because
    it is the Bible. For example I don't like the \"*may* work be done\", because
    there is no \"may\" implied in the Hebrew. Furthermore, the Sages (which ones
    I'd have to check) take \"Six days shall you work\" as a commandment as much as
    resting on the seventh day. So \"may\" gives a twist that exclude this interpretation.
    Similarly \"*solemn* rest\" isn't there. It's more \"Rest! Rest or I'll whack
    you!\"    \r\n\r\nThe thing about the Fox translation is that you have to *listen*
    to its sound. And there you get more of the Hebrew than any other. \r\n\r\nBy
    the way, this passage is not the most clear example of success in what he is undertaking.
    The critic has taken one of the sentences where Fox had to really work to bring
    off his idea. I think it does succeed, but there are a lot of other places where
    he just knocks it out of the park IMHO.\r\n\r\nPs. Full disclosure: I know Everett,
    as he's married to a relative of mine."
