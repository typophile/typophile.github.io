body: "Does anyone know a typeface that has a complete alphabet that looks similar
  to the GO in Monopoly?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/go_6249.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  know there's a stigma attached to free fonts on this site, but I really can't justify
  spending any money on this \u2014 if I can't find a free typeface, I'll find an
  alternate solution. I'm making a book for a Monopoly-themed event, and the splash
  page for each section is going to say \"Collect $200 as you pass [section],\" with
  the [section] looking like the GO from Monopoly. I've looked through the square
  fonts section on \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 DaFont, but everything is either way
  off or not quite right.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    can''t think of anything free like this. On second thought check out fontstruct.com
    too. '

  body: "Given that it's only those two letters, I doubt there ever was a full font
    designed specifically for that.\r\n\r\nAnd since it's only those to letters, I'm
    not sure how exact you really need it to be anyways. A red, square typeface with
    black strokes is probably enough to communicate the concept."

  body: "Monopoly actually uses Kabal, which we're using for the \"Collect $200 as
    you pass\" part, but we need something for the section headings that looks like
    GO. I ended up making my own font in Fontstruct. Some of the letters look a bit
    wonky (R in particular), but I'll fix the outlines in Illustrator when I make
    the images.\r\n\r\nThanks for all of your help, everyone!"
