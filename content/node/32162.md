body: "Hi all,\r\nI have made a regular weight font. In Microsoft platform, applications
  still able to get the bold version (lets say when I press the bold button in MS
  Word). My question is how this default bold behavior is calculated and can we tune
  this default behavior using FontLab. \r\n\r\nAnd there is a small question what
  is the difference between \"Normal\" and \"Regular\" weight?  \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAtif\r\n"

  body: The trick is to design the bold yourself. That is, do a separate bold weight
    of your font instead of using the applications "fake" bolds.

    Windows operating systems. You have to design a real bold weight.\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "Thanks Phinny. Yes I understand that but I am just curious how they make
      this fake bold face. \r\n\r\nAnd what about the second question? \"the difference
      between regular and normal weight\"\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAtif"
