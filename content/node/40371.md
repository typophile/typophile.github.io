  must be the single worst act of political violence we've seen this year.</a> A beautiful
  woman shot in the neck by an assassin who then blew himself up, killing other 15
  people. Pakistan has been thrown into dissarray, with ten dead in riots, and Al
  Quaeda has claimed responsibility for the attack.\r\n\r\nI'm struck blind with horror
  and grief at the sheer violence of this act, at the notion of cutting down a woman
  who had dedicated her life to reinstating democracy. I am sheddingtears over this.
  Take a few minutes away from fonts, dear typophiles, find a quiet dark corner of
  the house, kneel down the floo---and pray. Pray for Benezier Bhutto, pray for her
  family, pray for her devastated country---pray that the violence does not proliferate
  and spread.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rredrose_6379.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
  not a religious person, but I believe in the power of prayer. If our thoughts are
  with Mrs. Buhtto, our hearts and minds will follow thru the power of collective
  consciousness.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    had worked in her father's government said that Pakistan had neglected its people
    for 60 years, with the top 30 million ignoring the needs of the other 140 million.
    That included the previous administrations of Benazir Bhutto, which initially
    supported the Taliban. He said it would take decades to remedy all the damage
    done by previous governments. In spite of her past failings, many felt she was
    the best hope for progress and stability.\r\n\r\nA dark and ominous day for the
    future of Pakistan and humanity.  "
