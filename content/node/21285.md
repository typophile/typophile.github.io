  now I need to edit my CV and really want to use the same typeface.\r\nI know GARAMOND
  is similar but i would really like the original one I used, I just can't remember
  where I got it from and can't find it anywhere!\r\nHope someone can help?!\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Kelly\r\n\r\nhttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a324/pinkytoe_1983/gallery_font.jpg\r\n\r\nthis
  image is a bit distorted around the edges of the characters, i'll try get another
  one up."

    of Galliard (not even well camoflaged), probably from a bargain font CD, or Corel
    Draw.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
