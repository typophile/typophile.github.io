  in advance for your help in identifying this art-deco style font - it should be
  easy as I saw several times but I can't figure out what it is.\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: Landsdowne is very close but I think <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Red-Rooster%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=Canterbury%20Old%20Style%20RR%20-%20Regular&fid=16e137d33c0eac8f7ab01fdcaa8fb4bd&fsize=60&text=Doktor%20der%20Rechtswissenschaft&fit=1|Canterbury
    Old Style RR]]</strong> by Red Rooster [1993] is a better match [it's not so round
    and serifs, kerning and x-height look closer]

  body: "Compare to an undocumented near clone of Canterbury, with the name Landsowne
    Commercial\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LandsowneCommercialAsDoktor_4710.gif]\r\nNot
    quite a 100% match.\r\nCanterbury Old Style was designed by Morris F. Benton for
    ATF in 1920, it was not completed for production until 1926.\r\nYou can also use
    yet another font based on Canterbury, which credits the source, Londonderry Air
    NF, by Nick Curtis \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LondonderryAirNFAsDoktor_3789.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/londonderry-air-nf/\r\nDon"
