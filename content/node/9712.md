  there is a lot of knowledge here. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been supplied with a logo in
  the form of a true type font, which was created for PC. I converted it to Mac with
  FontHopper, loaded it into Suitcase, and can see the logo using the QuickType preview.
  The logo is formed using the characters &#39;ABC&#39;. <BR> <BR>But it won&#39;t
  work in any applications: QuarkXPress, InDesign or Illustrator. I would be very
  grateful for any help with this.'

    fonts. Try putting them in your Library/Fonts folder.

    boxes, no characters.
