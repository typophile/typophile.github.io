  body: "The most widespread calligraphic standard around that time was the so called
    Carolingian minuscule. There are plenty of fonts to be found if you look for \"carolingian\".
    Please don't expect any upper case letters. It's a minuscule, right? The fusion
    of majuscule and minuscule into one script system was later on. And you might
    miss some other fancy letters like \u20AC\xAE\u2020\xA8\u03A9\xA8\u2044\xF8\u03C0\xE5\u201A\u2202\u0192\xA9\xAA\xBA\u2206\xA5\u2248\xE7\u221A\u222B~\xB5\u221E\xFC\xF6\xE4\xDF!\"\xA7$%/()=
    to name just a few.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule \r\n\r\nAlthough
    officially deprecated by Charlemagne the hard-to-read but easier to write script
    called Merovingian was still popular among scribes and chanceries, so that would
    be another candidate:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merovingian_script"

  body: In 1070 Uncial and its "small letter" form were a couple of hundred years
    old and still prevalent. See the type design work of Victor Hammer.

  body: Medieval where? Assuming you mean Europe, there would still be several writing
    systems in use. I doubt there would be any Merovingian minuscule in use by the
    eleventh century, but the Visigothic script was still predominant in Christian
    Spain and the Beneventan script in Latin southern Italy. Plus, of course, Greek,
    Arabic, Cyrillic, Glagolitic, and Futhark.

  body: "Great responses by all!\r\n\r\n@DTY I was hoping for Medieval scripts within
    an English context.\r\n\r\nHow about this for Carolingia for example? (minuscule
    and Majuscule?) http://www.dafont.com/carolingia.font\r\n\r\n@Michel Boyer good
    images, thanks\r\n\r\n@typerror  Victor Hammer as provided me with some good reference
    points, thanks\r\n\r\n@hrant Ease of reading would take precedence. I was hoping
    for it to be used as a branding/packaging title. The theme of the brand is historic/humour.\r\n\r\n"

    Ergo: just find a readable font that looks medieval.\r\n\r\nAnd avoid the junk
