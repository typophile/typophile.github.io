  specimen book. I have the option but have no idea on value.\r\n\r\nThis image is
  not of the actual book, but of roughly similar condition. Cover knocked about a
  bit, with few fingerprints. internally, a few fingerprints on a couple of pages,
  and foldouts well creased."

  body: The 1923 ATF Book generally sells for $250 to $350 here in the States. Check
    out Booksold.com + addall for some prices.

  body: Thank you for the reply, Bob. Will have to think about it at that cost (about
    400-450 Australian). Family and bills come first, unfortunately..

  body: I would put up a search on eBay. These show up every once in a while but they
    rarely break the $100 mark. These were printed in an enormous edition, can't recall
    it off the top of my head. Everyone interested in typography or letterpress already
    seems to have a copy. In the end, ATF still had so many of them they were used
    as fuel to heat the facilities.

    be why they go for so much now.\r\n\r\nSmall world: I first saw the 1923 ATF catalog
    while visiting Gerald (aka bieler) and, not only that, purchased my own copy from
    someone in Australia (for $250 Australian)."

  body: "Hi Mark\r\n\r\nThat would have been in St Paul, I'd guess. :\u2014) Those
    were good formative years for me.\r\n\r\nSomeone sent me a bunch of big old ATFs
    (pre-1923) a short while back as the result of a favor I did. Smelly, but turn-of-the-century
    smelly. I love books that smell.\r\n\r\nBut I've always favored the BB&S cat over
    ATF for some reason. Bit more funk to it I think. Whenever I see one on eBay I
    bid as they never ever sell for what they are worth. Probably have a half-dozen
    of em here and there. I really have to get serious about weeding my library!!!
    Still, never had a Hansen, which sort of bugs me, hmmm."

  body: Looked on ebay, and there was one going there (still is). After 4 days no
    one had bid, so put down a $50 bid. Well it is now over the 100 mark.16 hours
    to go.
