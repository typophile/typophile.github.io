  rel=\"nofollow\">Poem Script</a></strong> is a mixed collection of interpretations
  conjuring a late nineteenth century American pen script style. Though not an actual
  Italian letterform, this style was called \"Italian Alphabet\" stemming from an
  old penman's term for an alphabet where the stress or shades are opposite their
  normal placement. The American variant followed from the late eighteenth century
  British hand also confusingly called \"Italian Hand,\" which itself evolved from
  some seventeenth century French batarde scripts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophilepoem_5623.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  showcases the phenomenal control and mastery of hand skills required to create such
  ornamental and lively letters centuries ago. Producing the shaded strokes in reversed
  positions such as this required holding the pen in a position horizontal to the
  baseline, or the letterforms would have to be written backwards or by rotating the
  paper at peculiar and extreme angles to achieve the effect.\r\n\r\nExotic, elaborate
  and very attractive, <strong><a href=\"http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Poem-Script-Pro-SDT0000231?skeywords=type\"
