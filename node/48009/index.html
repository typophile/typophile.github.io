  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm trying to create an identity for my company, Manilla, but I'm having a hard time deciding what it should look like. I want the logo to represent that we are creative, fun and artistic (traditional arts). We try to use our own artwork in all the sites we do if the client is willing and if it fits. I've looked around for inspiration like on Logopond and Behance but I haven't found what I'm looking for.

However, Mike Perry has a lot of great hand-drawn type http://www.midwestisbest.com/work.php
The question is, if I decide to use a hand-drawn logo will that look less professional? 

I attached some past <strong>mock-ups</strong>. The last one is what I'm trying to perfect. The L loops represent my sister and I and are also supposed to be a stylized M.

btw, hi Typophiles! (first post)

That all depends on the execution. And by the looks of the samples you attached, you don't have to worry about that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">well, you have to admit that david has a point. the type does not, in and of itself, communicate what the public might wanna know about manilla. sometimes that's okay. "TARGET" does not convey "retail store" but it's a very successful logo.
but sometimes, it's not okay. if it's not an established brand, a logo that really tells us what to expect can be very helpful.

the bigger question is, are hand-drawn logos less professional, and the answer is no -- not if they're done with professionalism. or, yes -- if they're not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the post ChuckGroth. I understand what David means. A lot of logotypes depend on a logo to help establish the brand. Although, I haven't seen that many web agency logos with web related graphics. It's too predictable.

Since manilla uses custom artwork on sites I want the logo to look "artsy". I will post some hand-drawn logos this week. 

Otherwise, since I'm going to use the swoop logo, does anyone have any critiquing to give on: if the two l's look like an 'M' to you/ if the swoops are too big/too small.. etc?

Thanks </div>

I'm getting a sense that perhaps you're getting a bit anal on the details here.  Trust that you're going in the right direction with this project.  (Although I do feel your pain with self-critique.  It can be paralyzing!)

I think actually hand drawing this would give you more of an authentic, artsy feel.</div>

I attached some more logo ideas. I really can't pinpoint which direction I want to go in. Why am I treating this identity like it's for Nike lol? 

Anyways, to answer some of your questions:

Yes, Manilla is a creative agency and yes we're US based. We chose the name for a couple of reasons: 

Aluminum is half right on one of them. It does represent the plain, generic office cubicle-land. But to me it more so representative of the manila paper I drew on as kid. Creativity was welcome and free to express.

It's an inside joke. I'm half asian, so if you take a yellow asian man and mix it with a white caucasian man what do you get? Bad joke.

The two L's in manilla stand for my sister and I -- it's our company. Having the L's connected can represent our brother-sister relationship.

It sounds fun to say! We wanted a name that didn't make us <em>seem</em> like geeks i.e Hyper Revolution Media or Digitalistic Realm Design.

Aluminum, since you said it reminds of of the corporate world that makes it even more important for us to show in the identity that we're completely opposite of "cubicle land". That's why I feel a hand-drawn/"artsy" logo will hopefully get the message across.

As of now, I'm leaning towards the bottom ones. Unfortunately, it takes the emphasis away from the L's but I feel it's more fitting. As you can see in the top right, it looks funky mixing computer fonts with hand drawn letters in the same word. Well, at least the way I'm doing it.

What do you all think? BTW, these are all roughs and the bottoms ones aren't supposed to be on a baseline.</div>

As a Finn the word manilla makes me think of rope, so the loops are appropiate. Manila rope is manillaköysi in Finnish. Manillaköysi is also a famous book by Veijo Meri.

Wikipedia came up with this, too:
Manillas, ancient money first used in Africa by the Calabar Kingdom of present day Nigeria.
