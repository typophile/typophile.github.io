body: Slightly off-topic, but I&#39;m sure someone has encountered this sort of production
  effect... <BR> <BR>Does anybody know how I could accomplish a similar foil treatment
  as found on the slipcase of &#34;The Incredibles&#34; DVD? It&#39;s a fabulous,
  almost holographic, red, which might be a match color overprinted over a different
  color foil. Any suggestions on manufacturers&#39; websites or similar items? <BR>
  <BR>Thanks in advance.

    <BR>Not sure if it&#39;s the same process, but two vendors are listed &#34;Proma
    Technologies&#34; and &#34;Seneca Printing&#34; - might point you in the right
    direction. <BR> <BR>Searching for &#34;holographic foil DVD packaging&#34; seems
    to result in plenty of hits.  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: Just finished a foil job like this. There are lots of foil products that can
    me bonded to different media. The inks will shift a bit on the foil. I set the
    job up with a double bump opaque white under all process inks and left those inks
    that went directly onto the foil as PMS inks so they could be custom mixes. <BR>
    <BR>The seps on a job like this can be difficult.
