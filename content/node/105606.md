  body: Agree with aluminum, especially with the name Koushik's and the red star it
    has a Russian feel.

  body: "Like Darrel, I get a Soviet-era propaganda feeling from this (the red star
    triggers that response in Americans old enough to remember the cold war). \r\nThe
    figure doesn't say \"healthy athlete\" to me; it looks more like a very strong
    robot. Overall, it's extremely macho, as if the client assumes that their product(s)
    will not appeal to women (which may be true, in which case macho is the way to
    go)."

    from the tag line.\r\n\r\nAfter centering KOUSHIK and SUPPLEMENT STORE (which
    doesn't really need to in italics) you might find that the logo is a stronger
    mark with more weight to it."
