  and even after installing it fresh from the latest source, I don't actually see
  a Python 2.7 folder in my Library, only 2.3 - 2.6 . . .\r\n\r\nI suspect this conversation
  has already taken place somewhere on the forums but darned if I can find it . .
  . Any direction is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance all,\r\nStuart"
