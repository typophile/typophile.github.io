  body: "In 1902 Book Covers were an art form using hand lettering and illustration.
    Note the E's. No two are alike.\r\nThe lettering for this cover is representative
    of the fashion of the day. Note the tilde shaped bar on the E and F.  A few fonts,
    not all digitized, with this effect: Titania, Pretorian, Gazebo, Oriente (Oliver),
    Harlech, Grange, Olympian.\r\nDon"

  body: "This lettering was used on the first edition published by F. Warne & Co.
    in 1902.  Enhanced excerpt of the lettering on the cover, taken from my files:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoverLetteringExcerptedAndEnhanced_3674.jpg]\r\nExcerpt
    of the lettering on the cover of a later edition:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoverLetteringExcerpted_6313.jpg]\r\nNote
    that it looks similar but is more crudely executed.\r\nThe practice in the trade
    was to attempt to keep the tone consistent for a series -- which would explain
    the distinctive titling for your Beatrix Potter books.\r\nIn later years fonts
    were chosen that approximated the original lettering.\r\nHere is a 1999 edition
    with a font that is a pretty good match to the original lettering:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoverTitlingExcerpted_5399.jpg]\r\nI
    suspect that it is a private font produced for F. Warne & Co. \r\nAnyway, its
    not in my folder with tilde shaped bar fonts.\r\nDon"

    alternative (not saying it could be considered as close), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/yana|Yana]]
    by Laura Worthington could do the trick very well. Less but not off is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/erasmus-rr|Erasmus]]."

  body: "I confirmed that F. Warne is in fact currently using the font. See http://www.peterrabbit.com/
    where it appears in an interative book, perhaps as a Flash font excerpt. \r\nPenguin
    bought F. Warne in the 1980s and spend money on reviving the business. I suspect
    this included development of the new font. It might have been in-house or by contract.
    Some contracts, such as the well known one by the Economist magazine for Officina
    display, have an exclusive use period followed by return of rights to the designer
    for sale as the designer wants. In this case it seems Penguin/Warne have retained
    the rights and it will not be available for sale to the public any time soon.\r\nHowever,
    there is no copyright restriction on using the original lettering of 1902 to create
    an original font, without using any of the digital data owned by Penguin/Warne.
    See sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EandF_FromOriginalLettering_4521.jpg]\r\nThe
    question is whether anyone would pay for it. If there is no market, it's not worth
    doing.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Other restrictions would depend on various national laws.\r\nCertainly Warne
    would take action if such a font was used to promote Beatrix Potter stories, which
    can be freely distributed because they are in the public domain with long expired
    copyright, but are still cash cows for Warne because of the \"look and feel\"
    of the Warne product. Echos of Disney & The Mouse that extended intellectual property
    rights for generations after the creators have ceased to exist. IP is going to
    be a big issue in the upcoming decades. Plenty of employment for lawyers. Plenty
    of money for mega companies, not much for the actual creators.\r\nBTW AFAIK the
    lettering was not done by Potter. At least it's not mentioned in books about her
    that I have checked.\r\nDon"

    T looks closely like a fat T of \"Pretorian DT\"\r\n\r\nOverall maybe combo of
    various font type?\r\n\r\nShould not be any problem with copy write now for either
    font or the book from 1902.\r\n\r\nMaybe the R is another style of font?"

  body: "EF is NOT from an existing font. NOTHING was taken from the Warne web page!\r\nIt
    is an original creation made from scratch in Fontlab.\r\nIt is based on the original
    book covers lettering from 1902 to 1910.  There are almost two dozen, each with
    a variation of the same lettering style. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_SquirrelNutkin1903_5760.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_JeremyFisher1906_3565.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_TomKitten1908_4829.jpg]\r\nYou
    may check some at Archive.org. Search for Beatrix Potter.\r\nLettering artists
    of the era tended to copy one another so this is not a particularly original design.
    \r\nThe tilde shaped bar seems to have been first used by Thayler.\r\nThe T with
    raised spikes is a very common 19th century style.  See for example the digital
    revival from Canada Type. <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/\">Ronaldson</a>
    designed vy  Alexander Kay, Rebecca Alaccari and Patrick Griffin. Recommended
    for purchase. \r\nThe R, which varies from cover to cover, is a common style for
    lettering in the era.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "As mentioned in previous posts the private font produced for F. Warne & Co.
    will probably not be made available. But there ARE  some fonts with similar features
    in the \"transitional\" category -- i.e. Baskerville etc. This Warne variation
    might be described as being in an English vernacular style. Note its low contrast
    and large rounded serifs dished at the midpoint.\r\nI recommend <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/plantagenet/\">Plantagenet</a>
    by  Ross Mills of Trio Typeworks. Some letter forms are quite different, but the
    flavor is the same.\r\nDon"
