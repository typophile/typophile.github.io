		<div class="commentbody">Jordan- <BR> <BR>It looks good, but I have a few suggestions: <BR> <BR>The x in the lower case appears too dark - try eliminating half of the serif on the inner counter of the thicker stroke. <BR> <BR>The Z in the upper case could be bevelled at the corners. <BR> <BR>In a font like this, the tail of the Q can afford to be a bit more exhuberant. <BR> <BR>The figures irk me a bit. I understand that you're going for an old style look here, which is fine, but it can stand to better match the rest of the typeface. Strokes on the 1, 4 and 7 appear too dark. Plus, that aforementioned stroke on the 7 should come down as a descender. <BR> <BR>In my opinion, the punctuation seems too small for the rest of the letters. <BR> <BR>You've got a great start - I look forward to the end result! <BR> <BR>-Jake</div>

The uc &amp; lc Z do look better with the bevel at the corners. Not sure about the Q tail but does look better than that weak thing it had before. Needless to say, I am working on this. I would have to say before someone asks that I can guess that the approximate time it took to make the font so far has been about 2 months, not every minute of the day, but when working on it as I did today just on the changes, about 4 hrs per day. I enlarged the punctuation and put some different letters in one of the samples. The lc x is improved I think.? <BR> <BR>Jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone for the help and suggestions. It will take me a while to think through all of the suggestions and come up with something. Max, the differences in stroke thickness between uc and lc was indeed deliberate, perhaps though overdone. As to what I am trying to achieve with this font, hmm? I have to think about this. Hrant, your point about little 'compensations' as in Futura is a very good point. I will be back after I work on this some.

I printed out some samples at small point sizes, 10, 12, and the differences between uc and lc didn't appear to be a problem. See sample in 12 pt. I was not familiar with FF Shefiff but did look at it, and yes, there was a simiilarity in style with h, m, and n letters. This was not intentional, but it is changed anyway. Jake's suggestion re lc x was implemented. I am still thinking about where this is going, in response to Max H's question. Modern wood? <BR>Jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've been intending to post a comment here for some time, but haven't been able to devote the time to a full critique yet. I largely agree with what has been said so far. <BR> <BR>I can also add that you should look at the proportions, especially those of the upper case. The uc &quot;A&quot; and &quot;V&quot; seem a bit wide, and the &quot;Z&quot; seems a bit narrow, for example. <BR> <BR>I also agree that both the uc and lc &quot;S/s&quot; characters seem out of place with their present squarish forms. I'd like to see rounder forms to complement the &quot;C/c&quot;, &quot;G/g&quot; &quot;O/o&quot; and &quot;Q/q&quot; designs. <BR> <BR>Also, I'm curious as to why the numeral figures seem so small &ndash; the ascenders only reach the x-height, yet some of them have descenders that drop below the baseline. Are you planning multiple figure sets (such as lining cap-height figures, descending old-style figures, etc.)? <BR> <BR>I love the direction that the font is taking.
