body: "We've just finished the first phase of a redesign of the Scriptorium Fonts
  site.  We've increased the level of dynamic content and totally redone the layout
  and basic appearance of the site.  It's a bit more modern and a lot less clunky.\r\n\r\nRight
  now the revisions apply to the main entry page and most of the editorial and new
  release information material.  We're going to continue to gradually implement the
  same format changes on the rest of the site until it's all integrated.\r\n\r\nStop
  by and check it out.  Comments and suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nIt's all at www.fontcraft.com\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: "It's great to have a site dedicated to this area of typography, so all speed
    to you Dave.  The only thing about the site that spoils it for me is the main
    banner.  Whoever's done it has basically not heard of antialiasing.  The main
    name 'The Fontorium' is all jagged and rough.  It could be so much cleaner than
    this (assuming this is what you want to achieve).  I think you should also reconsider
    the use of the 'outer glow' effect on the name.\r\n\r\nGood luck with the site
    though.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "Hi Dave, please check your sample for Waldeck: There is an umlaut missing.
    Instead of \"halt ihn warm\" it must spell \"h\xE4lt\". Or am I to assume the
    typeface contains no umlauts?\r\n\r\nBTW, I like your stuff."

  body: "Waldeck does have characters with umlauts, I just typed the sample text in
    a hurry and forgot to use the proper accented characters.  Very sharp eye to catch
    that.\r\n\r\nDave"
