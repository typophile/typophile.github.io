  body: "Hi Faiyaz,\r\n\r\nthe threads you mention show manipulated glyphs.\r\n[[Type
    design]] isn\u2019t [[typography]].\r\nSome basic vector editing can be done with
    all of the applications you listed (maybe Photoshop isn\u2019t really very suitable
    for that).\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]]:
    especially for vector-based drawing; also (limited) possibility to do text (type-setting)
    and layout (importing/arranging images, \u2026)</li>\r\n<li>[[Adobe InDesign|InDesign]]:
    main focus is extensive multi-page layout, type-setting, typography (e.g. book
    design). Some (limited) vector drawing capabilities.</li>\r\n<li>[[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]:
    image editing/creation, mainly pixel-oriented (so, not the best tool to do neither
    type design nor typography)</li>\r\n<li>[[Fontlab]]: <em>the</em> tool for type
    design and font creation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf all you aim for is to manipulate/draw
    a glyph or two, you break a fly on the wheel with Fontlab. Illustrator will do.
    If you want to make a functional font out of your glyphs (so that you can type
    with it), then indeed it\u2019s the right choice.\r\n\r\nYou can also learn a
    about the [[software]] in the wiki or at the manufacturers\u2019 sites (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/?ogn=EN_US-gn_prod\">Adobe</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/\">Fontlab</a>).\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "Thank you very much Florian! That cleared up alot.\r\n\r\nI think I will
    give Fontlab a try. I'm downloading the demo version right now. Is it hard to
    use? Are there any basic tutorials online?"

  body: TypeTool 3, a kind of a junior Fontlab, works very well for many basic font
    design and manipulation needs, and is easier on the brain and pocketbook.
