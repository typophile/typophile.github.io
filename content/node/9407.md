  body: Markus, PDF samples are not really helpful. Next time please  <BR>make sure
    to post RGB .GIF or .JPG files. If you&#39;re new to this  <BR>Board, it helps
    if you read the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25290.html?1075596272"

  body: Someones been putting a white stroke on your sample so it&#39;s almost impossible
    to id it you can get a similar feel by applying a stroke to Gill <BR>Tim

  body: Even Futura is modulated a small amount for optical reasons. I think Tim might
    be on the right track, although changing weight using a white stroke like that
    would a bit unpredictable.

  body: I had to check first but it is slightly modulated. <BR>It might not be the
    exact font but I&#39;m convinced someone has put a stroke on a regular sans. This
    is Gill at 48pt with a 4pt white stroke. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66069.jpg"

  body: nevahmind...i found it and it doesn&#39;t match. :^/ I&#39;d say Tim has a
    good close match only slightly in need of squooshing.
