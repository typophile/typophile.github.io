  now discovered :-):\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me identify the font, which is used on
  the covers of the new P. G. Wodehouse books. I am attaching a sample for reference.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance\r\n\r\nAmar"

  body: "Welcome to the forum, Amar.\r\n\r\nQuick question: Did you want to know if
    this is a specific typeface?\r\nor do you like the style and are interested in
    very similar typefaces?\r\n\r\nThat can help cut down the search time for us Font
    ID zealots."

    does look a bit like it, but unfortunately, not quite :-(. You must be rigth about
    the hand lettering!\r\n\r\nNorbert, Thanks for the query! I would be very much
    interested in any very similar typefaces!\r\n\r\nRegards."
