  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m interviewing for a job tomorrow at a small weekly newspaper  &ndash; it&rsquo;s a non-profit that I wholeheartedly support, and therefore I&rsquo;d love the work. It&rsquo;s a solid job with a twenty-year-old company, and the people are amazing pioneers.  Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a job I want badly because it&rsquo;s 100% telecommute &mdash; this is invaluable to me so I can help take care of my dad (he has the Big C.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my problem.</p>
<p>The publication is the freakin' ugliest, pastel, comic sans, clip-art sprinkled NIGHTMARE. I swear to god they would publish in neon puff paint if the could find a way.</p>
<p>Normally, I&rsquo;d see this as a fabulous opportunity to elevate the quality of their award-winning editorial content and help bring them a whole new market share &hellip; but, alas, I see the hot-pink and lime-green logo was designed by the woman who is interviewing me (the &ldquo;Creative Director&rdquo;).  The logo includes a red lipstick &ldquo;kiss&rdquo; instead of the letter O.  It looks like something my seven-year-old niece would draw on her notebook in crayola markers - the scented kind.  This woman owned her own design firm, for twenty years, shockingly, so she obviously in entrenched in her &ldquo;style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have any of you had positive experiences with such obstacles? Should I just keep job hunting? Is there hope for the scented crayola lovers?</p>

So keep looking.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In South Carolina there is a newspaper named PINK. And it&rsquo;s logo is in that same green and pink you discussed. It is new in comparison to the one you are interviewing for.</p>
<p>If you want the job &ndash; you have to like where you are working. If you are unhappy with their &ldquo;design&rdquo; decisions, it may not be for you. However, if they are looking to hire new blood, and in the interview you find out they are wanting to revamp the newspaper &ndash; you may find this is the perfect job for you.</p>
<p>Take a few deep breaths and remember to listen. Find out who they want, what they want, where they were and where they plan to go or grow. Then try to reach your conclusion if this is a job for you.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, remember John Stuart Mill. You know what you like and what you can be educated to be good at, spend your life trying to reach that goal.</p>
<p>And the very best of luck to you.</p>

<p>This is why I&rsquo;d avoid it. Unless you want to fight all day (and some do), it will likely be a nightmare. Or it&rsquo;ll take a loooong time. I was involved in taking a non-profit theatre advocacy group from a very MS Word-by-a-secretary look to a professional and successful non-profit institution. But I did it all pro-bono and worked exclusively with the executive director. It was so great, and increased their profile and membership with no additional promotion. In your case, it sounds like a vast difference in style and preference, rather than a lack of training. You may be right that an updated design will help them, but they may not be ready to make that change yet.</p>
