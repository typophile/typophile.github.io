body: 'Motivated by the discussion about Sabon in the &#34;Trapping&#34; thread, I
  tracked down the issue of the Penrose Annual that Rodolfo mentioned. <BR> <BR>Sabon
  had two ranges: 6-12 and 14-48. The former range: <BR>1&#41; Was for all three systems:
  Monotype, Linotype, foundry. <BR>2&#41; Has short descenders, but apparently longer
  alternates were provided. <BR>3&#41; Has optical scaling, but not very pronounced
  in the 6. <BR>4&#41; Has wide &#34;a&#34;s. <BR> <BR>While the latter: <BR>1&#41;
  Was for foundry setting only. <BR>2&#41; Has long descenders. <BR>3&#41; Has nice
  optical scaling. <BR>4&#41; Has narrow &#34;a&#34;s. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m starting to
  think that JT opted for the wide &#34;a&#34; in the smaller range to accomodate
  the smallest sizes better. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think I&#39;ve found the worse glyph
  ever: Sabon&#39;s italic &#34;f&#34;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/18006.gif"

  as bad: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/italic/win-ttf/187600/character/0066/CP2/"

  body: Ouch. That&#39;s just too painful. I shouldn&#39;t have looked at this to
    begin my day. I have to say though, that it&#39;s a pretty interesting example.
    Even the idols have feet of clay.
