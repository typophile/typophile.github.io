body: Does anyone know how to restrict the way Indesign (CS3 on OS X 10.4) generates
  decimal increments so that it places points at units such as 5p0 or 5p2.5 as opposed
  to 4p8.667 or 5p2.467?

    put something in place, move it, resize it, etc. with the mouse this happens.
    I remember that this was bug on CS2 running on Intel macs, but it occurred as
    a result of an Apple update that popped up last year sometime. I thought that
    it was supposed to have been fixed in CS3."

    for instance, the mouse will move things in increments of one quarter of a point.
    If you\u2019re looking at 700% it moves things in increments of one seventh of
    a point, which gives all kinds of funky numbers.\r\n\r\nChristian A. Harder"
