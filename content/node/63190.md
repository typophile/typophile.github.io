  body: "I think this is a tough one, because you have each version of Copperplate
    Gothic with the uppercase Caps and lowercase Caps (SC). One of these might be
    either one of those blown up to seem like the same height. There are nine different
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/copperplate-gothic/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D124%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DBNV%2520bnv%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dsingle%26seed%3D32|Adobe
    versions]], yielding 18 sets of letters. There are of course many other foundries
    with versions of CG. On top of that, someone may have done some graphic manipulation
    on some of the letters.\r\n\r\nMy question is really what are you looking for?
    (And yes, they are both Copperplate Gothic in origin, even though some foundries
    may call their font by another name.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Very odd that the thickness on the \"V\" in the top row is so different from
    that of the \"B\" and \"N\". The difference in the serifs is another red flag,
    in my opinion, that someone has been playing around with each letter. The \"V\"
    in the top row is really the oddball here and reminds me of the Sesame Street
    segment 'which of these things doesn't belong?'.\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess I'D
    say someone set the top row in Copperplate, pulled the top of the \"V\" apart
    and messed around with the serifs on the \"B\" and \"N\".\r\n\r\nSmall Caps could
    very well be at play here as Mike so accurately pointed out."
