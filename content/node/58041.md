body: "Hi there\r\nI have always wanted to make an ambigram.\r\nJust for fun, but
  never came around to it.\r\nBeside that I did't like the blackletter-style, medieaval-styl
  ambigrams. So I never started on it. No idea what else they should look like.\r\n\r\nBut
  finaly I did and am very surprised by the outcome.\r\n\r\nI think I made an ambigram
  that is perfectly readible upside down, but even on its sides! Well, I think it
  does.\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts.\r\n\r\n"

    strange about the kerning\u2026 it's kind of hard to tell though. But don't mess
    <em>too</em> much with this thing of beauty! :-)"

  body: "My inspiration?\r\nWell, one day I was having a look at the sun ... wearing
    no sun glasses and I saw a bunch of little stars contrasting beautifuly against
    the sun. Why I was looking at the sun hasn't become clear to me. But it was a
    moment of eureka!\r\nThe start of a beautiful project.\r\n\r\nI think I will name
    it: O, simplicity. What do you think?\r\n\r\nA few days later - by the way - I
    realized that it didn't matter from which angle you look at our yellow spot in
    the sky. It remains circular.\r\n\r\nA revelation.\r\n\r\nWow.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
