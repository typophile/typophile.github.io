  is said to have influenced M.F. Benton\u2019s design for Franklin Gothic. The same
  claim is made about Franklin Gothic and News Gothic in the Meggs/Carter book <em>Typographic
  Specimens: The Great Typefaces</em>. In neither case is there any explanation or
  substantiation. Does anyone know if Benton actually did see Akzidenz can I safely
  write this off as a historian jumping from correlation to causation?"

    says nothing of such an influence \u2013 which I myself find very unlikely, since
    Benton had numerous models of Gothic faces to draw on in the catalogues of the
    23 independent foundries which formed ATF. Furthermore, Franklin Gothic shows
    numerous features which make it a very different typeface from Akzidenz Grotesk
    (the two-storey g, for instance, when one of the innovations of AG was a single-storey
    g)."

    written \"one of AG's most distinctive features\u2026\". Thank you for correcting
    me.\r\nAnyway, it seems unlikely that Benton, had he been influenced by Akzidenz
    Grotesk, would have overlooked this peculiar (at the time and in America) trait,
    which is an integral part of AG's personality."
