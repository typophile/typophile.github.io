    of such faces by H&FJ called the \"Shades\" collection shown here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100023\r\n\r\nThese
    fonts are typically used to create \"chromatic\" effects on the page since the
    highlight and lowlight areas of the faces (set directly on top of each other so
    they interlock) are set in different colors."
