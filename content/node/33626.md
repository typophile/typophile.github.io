  body: Clarendon. The <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/clarendon/extra-bold/">Extra
    Bold</a> weight, to be precise. There are several digital versions, of which the
    Linotype one I linked will do fine.

    the Euros aren't awake.

  body: "And here in Australia the working day's coming to an end, so there's a chance
    to check the Boards... and I STILL can't there first! I double-click on an entry
    THE VERY SECOND it appears in my RSS Reader, and there are already AT LEAST four
    responses! Does it really take that long for a feed to span the Pacific and make
    its way way-hey-hey down here? \r\n\r\nIt's like the old days playing network
    games over the Internet when there'd be tech-support geeks plugged directly into
    the server with microscopic ping times, and they'd frag you before you even realised
    they were on you! \r\n\r\nBut I'm not whinging! Really! Hehe."

    and I don't think I've run into you again since. Nice to see you again. :)
