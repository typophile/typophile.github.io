Avoiding the g is in my view important, as it is quite difficult for beginners, and with a wider acceptable design space within each style.  <BR>The letters in &quot;adhesion&quot; also allow decent texts to be composed, so that people can begin proofing the texture of the typeface pretty early in the process.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As reckless and naive as it is, I start with &quot;a&quot; - I'm not a real text face designer yet - plus I don't make numerically enough [Latin] fonts to have a solid method. After &quot;a&quot; I rough out certain letters that would be best at expressing the spirit fleshed out in the &quot;a&quot;, and I guess this depends how much character the face is to have*. If it's supposed to be docile, I'll probably make the &quot;n&quot; and the other structural primitives; if it's flamboyant, I might do roughs of the &quot;g&quot; or the &quot;f&quot; or the &quot;y&quot; very early. The &quot;o&quot; I do very late, for some reason. After the roughs, I tend to go straight in and design the lc alphabet sequentially, always leaving things open for major revision. Maybe this way is slower but leaves things more open? <BR> <BR>* Which makes me point out: I think we need to distinguish between text and display font design. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Could you show me an example of a &quot;good&quot; italic and a &quot;bad&quot; that you have in mind? <BR> <BR>My pleasure!  :-) <BR> <BR>It's much easier to point out &quot;bad&quot; ones (although I want to clarify that I find them only ideologically bad - usually they're generally &quot;usable&quot; italics, whatever that means) because there's so many of them. Basically the italics that are fed an extra IV-shot of chirography (hand-based design) as a means of either pulling them away from the roman, or (worse) expressing some misplaced artistic preference, are &quot;bad&quot;. Usually this means the italic is drawn from scratch, and this generally detracts from its function as a style subordinate to the [hopefully more typographic] roman. Of course, an italic also does indeed need to stand out sufficiently from a body of roman, but there's plenty of leeway to do that without resorting to Stone Age nostalgia. BTW, an alternative, secondary italic that's highly chirographic is functionally fine (although ideologicaly still a no-no). Heck, you can even make one of those now-fashionable &quot;upright italics&quot;, but: don't pretend it works the way users need an italic to work; I think it would be better to call that a &quot;cursive roman&quot;. <BR> <BR>As for &quot;good&quot; ones, they're very rare. I notice one once in a blue moon, but an italic that I've admired for a while is Octavian's*. Although it's still a bit too chirographic for my tastes, at least it matches its roman in that, so it doesn't use chirography as a drag queen outfit. Also, although I don't pretend it's the best thing since sliced bread, but I have tried to express my ideal-italic theories in my own work, specifically Patria**. It still needs some effort before it's ready (like optical slant correction, and length adjustment in some serifs and beaks) but I'm proud of the fact that the outlines are in fact mathematically derived from the same source as the roman (with some subsequent adjustment) but people still think it's usable (unlike the Morison stuff). <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml">http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/OCTQ/F_OCTQ-10005300.jhtml</a></a> <BR> <BR>** <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am amazed at Hrant's statement about good and bad italics. <BR> <BR>Is not a slanted roman really an oblique? And I thought a true italic was really a seperate design that in modern type compliments a roman in weight and color &hellip;etc. <BR> <BR>I think of a slanted roman as a 'bad' italic, as it adds nothing to the family/face and is more a product of digital bastardization than actual design. <BR> <BR>As too renaming italics as cursive romans - well, that kinda ignores historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation of hand writing, no? So, why not leave that alone? Why rename something that is aptly named and is correct in its lable? <BR> <BR>One could argue that romans should have no italic, as italics historicaly stood on their own. But to say that only slanted romans are useful and good seems a bit of a stretch to this amatuer type guy. <BR> <BR>Hrant, maybe I am misunderstanding your comments. Would you care to elaborate? <BR> <BR>Tanks! <BR> <BR>BTW, I am a terriable speller - do we have a spell check on the forum??? If not, thank you for your patience with my lack. <BR> <BR>;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I think you should made a disctinction between counter forms and position of the thickest/bolder part on the letters.</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, this is a very good point, and it is interesting to look over the illustration above while concentrating on the counter axis. There is less variation in the counter axis of the o and other letters than is apparent when one looks at the modulation of the whole letter. There are also, though, some surprises: the axis of the counter of the Calisto o is actually rotated slightly <i>anti</i>clockwise compared to the d. Never noticed that before.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, I agree that mechanically slanted romans suck. Morison's mistake was that he failed to temper his ideology with design sense (probably because he had none of the latter). What I'm advocating is non-chirographic italics, which isn't the same thing at all. It is counter to the essence of typography to use chirography to differentiate two styles, just like romans themselves can be more or less chirographic (and I think the latter are weaker). <BR> <BR>Such an italic can even be drawn seperately than the roman, as long as it harmonizes <i>in its subordinate role</i>. The primary contemporary function of an italic is to emphasize words in a body of roman - that's how users use the stuff. And all an italic really needs to perform this primary funciton is slant (although lighter color and other divergences can help too, especially if the slant is slight). Any other use of an italic (such as for an independent body of text) is strictly secondary. That at least isn't dogma, it's pragmatism. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think multiple italics are a great idea. <BR> <BR>&gt; it adds nothing <BR> <BR>You could say it's not supposed to add anything, it's just supposed to not detract from functionality. An italic that's more chirographic than its roman diluted the focus of the overall design. <BR> <BR>&gt; cursive romans <BR> <BR>I meant that only in reference to what's called &quot;upright italics&quot;, like in Seria and Unibody. I have no problem calling slanted italics &quot;italics&quot; (as long as they're not merely obliques), not least because a new term would confuse things! But I think &quot;cursive roman&quot; is a better description for upright italics, simply because slant is the primary determinant for the <i>user</i>, who as a layman has no idea about chirographic versus typographic structures (certainly not consciously). <BR> <BR>&gt; historical issues, such as italics by nature were a representation of hand writing <BR> <BR>1) What's more important, the past or the future? <BR>2) Hey, romans came from there too! But now they've broken free (although still not enough, yet) - so let's do the same favor for italics. <BR> <BR>&gt; to say that only slanted romans are useful and good <BR> <BR>I was careful to say that chirographic italics can be -and are- &quot;useful&quot; to many -probably most- people. <BR>But there's a difference between what the masses casually choose versus how culture progresses. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant - thank you for making a distinction and clarifying your argument. I wondered if I had not quite understood the essence of what you were saying. <BR> <BR>I would also agree that usage should be a primary conscern when designing, so an italic should be valued for its ability to do its job. <BR> <BR>But, having said that, I would argue that something that has proven successful for hundreds of years is rooted in useability. Maybe not always, but a high percentage of successful design is based on historical evolutions. <BR> <BR>Thanks for taking the time to explain.</div>
