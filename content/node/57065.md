  body: "> Helvetica is one of the widely used in design today. Why?\r\n\r\nIt got
    selected as the default face in the original PostScript printers as the sans face.
    Just as Times Roman was the default serif face. Without that, it would be no where
    as popular (or overused, if that is your view)."

    Have you by any chance just typed or copied/pasted your school assignment question
    here, rather than searching the web for the answer yourself?"

  body: Helvetica is only so popular because Univers was too expensive for Americans.
    Otherwise it would have been Univers, all the time, everywhere.

  body: I don't want DanGayle to be the last one to post an answer in this thread,
    so I am just going to add that there is a "new" book (er, newly translated into
    English, that is), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Helvetica-forever-Typeface-Victor-Malsy/dp/3037781211"><em>Helvetica
    Forever</em></a>, which may help to answer tjm's questions.

  body: "@James\r\n[[Mike Parker]] said it a bunch of times at Typecon. He said that
    he, as the dude at Linotype here in America, had to choose between Helvetica and
    Univers for import into America for general use. He said that Univers was probably
    better, and had a wider range of characters, but that it was much more expensive
    to license than Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, America got Helvetica, while Europe
    got Univers."

  body: "Dan, a sweeping generalization based on one man's anecdotal reference is
    not good history.\r\n\r\nBoth Univers and Helvetica were readily available from
    North American type houses from the 1960s on, and type set in either was the same
    price per character.\r\n\r\nThere were some differences. For instance, referring
    to the metal specimen of Fleet Typographers, a shop in Toronto still active in
    the 1980s (I used them occasionally), one notes:\r\n\r\n<ul> <li>Linotype: Helvetica
    Light, Medium and Bold with italics; Univers Light, Medium, Bold and Extra Bold
    with italics.</li> <li>Ludlow: neither (Tempo, a Futura clone, is the sans)</li><li>Foundry:
    Helvetica Light, Medium and Bold; no Univers</li><li>Monotype: Univers Medium
    and Bold with italics, Bold Condensed, Extra Bold; no Helvetica. </li> </ul>"
