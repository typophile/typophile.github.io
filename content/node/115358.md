body: "We have a situation where our identity font is displaying terribly in Microsoft
  2010 on Windows 7. The font looks great in InDesign and Illustrator. The font family
  is OpenType with PostScript outlines, aka CFF. This behavior is consistent for any
  OpenType font from Adobe, ie Myriad Pro or Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nI am nearly certain
  that the Windows font rendering engine is optimized for TrueType outlines and renders
  PostScript outlines poorly. I also think that Adobe is using a different rendering
  engine for the Creative Suite applications, perhaps their own. I have not been able
  to find any specific documentation of these statements.\r\n\r\nDoes this ring true?
  Does anyone know of specific documentation of poor font rendering in Windows applications,
  especially MS Office?"

  body: "The font in question is H & FJ's Whitney, though the problem shows for any
    OpenType font containing PostScript Outlines, such as Adobe Myriad Pro.\r\n\r\nYes,
    I meant Microsoft Office 2010. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I have also advised not to use the
    primary identity font in any MS Office documents. Inevitably, the document will
    end up on a machine - internally or a client's - that is not licensed for Whitney,
    causing font substitution and layout problems.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "Well, there is this, from John Hudson, in a current build forum thread:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Font
    rendering is platform-specific (where platform is typically operating system,
    but can be individual applications (e.g. Adobe apps, which use their own rendering
    engines) or subsets of the system (e.g. the Metro environment on Windows 8). So
    the best way to test font rendering, hinted or otherwise, is to test widely on
    as many platforms as possible.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI suspect generalities will
    have to do you, vis-a-vis MS Word, which runs on multiple operating systems even
    within the Mac/Windows dichotomy.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I've heard the same rumor: for
    Word, always use ttf fonts. And if you want OT features to work, be sure a digital
    signature is seen.\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit</cite>\r\nBy the way, I don't believe the
    company is now known as H&F-J, esp. where Whitney is involved...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2014/1/17/5318206/hoefler-and-frere-jones-lawsuit"
