  body: "Hm\u2026 I think Typ1451 (<a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Typ1451/Regular/\">link</a>)
    is close but not an exact match. See the vertex of the \"M\", the relative lengths
    of \"E\"'s arms, and the angle of the \"R\"'s leg. Also in Typ1451 the curves
    in the hood of the ampersand and the \"S\" seem to be a hint less open. \r\nThe
    sample is quite small though, so it's hard to tell."
