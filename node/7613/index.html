		<div class="commentbody">To Hrant : <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; What kind of cars?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; All kind of cars. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; What kind of [potential] buyers?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; Ranging from a penniless guy looking for a jalopy to a tycoon looking for a Porshe. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; How do Bulgarians feel about Arabs, or Turks?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; Not so great, because of the turkish slavery on Bulgaria. It lasted for 5 centuries. Nevertheless, nowadays people are more broad-minded than they were for example 1-2 centuries before. It seems that the contemporary spirit of the bulgarians is trying to mingle with every single culture it come across. This creates an amalgam(mixture) of cultures, which in my humble opinion is not a good thing. Everybody is trying to copy the East or the West and not care about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;here&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I have to answer the question directly - No, there is no prejudice about the arabs and sometimes they are even thought as a good thing. (if we don't stem from historical point of view of course ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; Especially since it sounds like &quot;sheikh&quot;! :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; You are right about that. However, in Bulgarian the word &quot;sheikh&quot; is pronounced somewhat differently than the word &quot;shik&quot;. In fact, the word &quot;shik&quot; in phonetical point of view is composited of only 3 phonemes (&quot;sh&quot; - diphthong, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;k&quot;). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; If it were Russia I'd say stay away from that style for sure (I still remember the way the people on the plane from Moscow to Novosibirsk were looking at me. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Don't mind them. They always gawk at strangers. (Beware stranger ;)) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To Tanya :  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; hmmm&hellip;spooky car. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; Is it the color(black) that creates the spooky sensation? I didn't want to entangle in complex illustration. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; It's looking quite eastern to me. some kind of asian or indian thing going on definately. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; I feel the same thing. It was not intentional, but after I am here maybe we can comment on the eastern look.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; &hellip;has me thinking japan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; I have to admit that the circular elements on the business card are quite japanese ;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt;&hellip;has me thinking Arab <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; It seems are though I have created a Corp.ID for an Arabic company. ;)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To Scott :  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; &hellip;&quot;cute&quot; rather than chic.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; The word &quot;chic&quot; in my language have a multiple meaning and is often perceived as the word &quot;cute&quot; with a slight tint of extravagant. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; I'm not sure about repeating it on both sides of the bizcard. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; I'm not sure, either. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt; Is there a reason you didn't layout out the letterhead in that same fashion?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;&lt; It was a requirement for the envelope design - (to center the logotype) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->p.s Some propositions on fonts that look chic are welcomed ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Galin, I hope your client has plenty of money because the only way you will get the black on the envelope to work properly is to print and then convert into envelopes. Alot more expensive. Same holds true for your bleeds on the letterhead and business cards. Also when cutting the business cards with the knock out type so close to the edge you will have alot of waste and the overs will cost alot once again. I would suggest showing your designs to a printer and maybe get some feedback on how to make them work with in a resonable budget.</div>
