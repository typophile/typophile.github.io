  body: "seems like an old post, but I'd like to point out some obvious problems.\r\n\r\n1.
    The line length is too long\r\n2. If the bottom of the italic title for the 3
    piece is lined up with the third line, why not the first two. I don't understand
    the significance of putting the titles one line below the numbers.\r\n3. Depends
    on what sort of paper size you're printing on, the point size could be a bit smaller.\r\n\r\nI
    like the color and the font itself."
