body: 'Hello Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I am working on an identity for my old client, now
  the employer. Actually, it is a very little bit of re-design, and mostly working
  out a set of routines and documents for office use - with renewed CI. <BR> <BR>&#40;Set
  up&#41; <BR>As the correspondence is mostly being sent per email, there is no real
  need for the letterhead being offset-printed &#40;First, I was against it, totally.
  But then, if you think about it, it makes sense - why have a stock of 1000 sheets
  of paper without any good use?&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;Issue&#41; <BR>Anyway, I am now
  trying to make &#34;a form&#34;, be it a Word or a Acrobat document or anything
  other format, with letter-head embedded, where a colleague of mine could type his
  or her letter. So now I am struggling with the following problem: <BR>- I cannot
  embed Type1 fonts into Word-documents and I don&#39;t have and cannot make Windows
  convert my Type1 font to TrueType, which is what Word could have possibly embedded;
  <BR>- if I use Acrobat and make a form there, it wouldn&#39;t add a page automatically,
  so it&#39;S always a one-pager &#40;plus, it has printed the footer as if it was
  a blurred image, though it was just a font&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;Additional&#41; <BR>I
  have Adobe CS coming my way, with Acrobat 6 &#40;I think&#41; packed inside. For
  a 5 people office it should be ok to install it, if we need it &#40;I asked the
  shop, they said - oh, sure&#41;. <BR>We have MS Office. <BR>The fonts are all Type1
  &#40;ttf versions would cost us the same price again - thank you FontFont&#41;.
  WinXP says it cannot convert Type 1 font as the copyright forbids to do so &#40;thank
  you FontFont again&#41;. <BR>I have ATM DeLuxe installed. <BR>I have no font editor
  installed and am not going to have one. :/ <BR> <BR>What would you recommend? <BR>
  <BR>I know, this sounds like, &#34;oh, I am so dumb and poor and lazy&#34;, but
  I am trying out everything, what I can - and stuck pretty much on the same place...

  body: One thought that may or may not apply here. In a time where everyone uses
    email, recieving a nice printed piece of paper with the company identity in offset
    or even letterpress with some communication on it can stand out quite nicely.
    <BR> <BR>So, from a marketing standpoint printed letterhead could serve a purpose.
    <BR> <BR>Sorry, I do not have an answer to your question, but I thought I would
    at least share a little. <BR> <BR>Good luck with your project. <BR> <BR>Mike

  body: Would this work? -- <BR> <BR>Make the typesetting and the logo one single
    file created in Illustrator, with &#34;convert to outlines&#34; applied to the
    type. Then place it in your letterhead document. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re working
    in Word, this will also give you nicely fitted type, which you wouldn&#39;t otherwise
    get, as Word doesn&#39;t support the kerning in a font.

  body: Mike, <BR>I agree with you and that was also my point &#40;or rather, I would
    consider it as being a good point, as I was trying to persuade the then-client
    with traditional arguments&#41;, but as I see what kind of correspondence comes
    and goes here, there is no need for perinted matter, and the guys want to have
    everything done in 2 minutes. Sending a letter with a snail-mail would cost them
    time and money &#40;time would be the 1st reason at all&#41;. :/ <BR> <BR>Nick,
    <BR>I&#39;ve made them a letterhead a year or so before, embedded it into Word
    file and they were using it as a template for all their writing. Now, as I am
    working with them, I try to set things nice and clear. Franklin Gothic was used
    as a corporate font and they even succeded in using it consequently throughout
    the correspondence &#40;which made me glad and proud of them&#41;. One could even
    embed it, if he wanted. Now I am trying out a new font, FF Kievit, which I have
    only as a Type1. Word still seems a good - or rather the only possible - way to
    go, but I cannot embed the font into the document. :/ <BR> <BR>Ah, courier has
    just brought me the Adobe CS! Nice...
