<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello,
I am planning a trip to london soon and I was woundering, are there any original pieces of Edward Johnston still viewable in the Underground? Or is everything a reissue which I think I remember reading somewhere.
thanks.

<div class=commentbody>It's been nearly 14 years since I was there, but I remember being pretty impressed by the London City Musuem--by its comprehensiveness in particular. I would not be surprised at all to learn that some of Johnston's original work was being preserved there, in storage or in the exhibits. Give it a try--and like I said, it's a great musuem anyway.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think it is Johnston's original font that is on all the station signs still. They may be renewed, but I believe it's the same font as always--quirky, friendly and wonderful. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Ideally you'll like to have a look at the London Underground Station Design Audits, which are held in the London Transport Museum Library. They are a guide to "<em>elements on the station[s] worth conserving as well as a pointer to possible future restoration of deteriorated or missing architectural details...London Underground wishes to conserve all those features which are representative of the station's history where they are still relevant.</em>"
Unfortunately the museum itself is being 'transformed', so I don't know how accessible the collection is. The website can be found here - <a href=http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/>http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk</a>.
No idea if this book lists stations with original fittings, but it's worth a look - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1854142313/qid=1140384229/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_0_4/026-6296368-4802057">Johnston's Underground Type</a>.
Aldgate's audit mentions "<em>platform canopy at North end probably 19th Century originals. They incorporate 1920s brass trimmed free standing signs.</em>" Not sure if they are 'original' or not, a quick search on flickr found <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/ickoonite/23312491/>this</a> (I seem to have misplaced all my photographs of the station). It also found this, at <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/iantindale/38978031/>Aldgate East</a>, just down the road.
I presume the latter is what you're looking for, and I know there are a lot of the older signs at many of the stations - including tiles - but offhand I couldn't say which. Some of the more central stations ring a bell - Tottenham Court Road and Leicester Square - but I haven't been on a tube for quite some time; south east London doesn't have many tube stations.
