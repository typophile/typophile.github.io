body: "what tools do you use to test typefaces, combinations, and colours on the web.\r\n\r\nfor
  example, there's the typecast tool http://typecast.com/. which i don't like because
  it only shows the name of the typeface when doing selections. i find it hard to
  make judgements with only small samples.\r\n\r\nso what i currently use is Adobe
  Edge Animate http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/. it's meant for html/css animation,
  but it allows for the quick use of web fonts and their preview."
