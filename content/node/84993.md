  body: Awww, Man!! I wish it were a cleaner version of American Typewriter. Like
    an extra-light, wide version of clarendon.

  body: "Thanks guys! I think I like Parry and Suomi Slab Serif best . . . just wish
    there was a wider version similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/inlove/|inlove]]
    but with serif qualities of the former.\r\n\r\nI like to use inlove as a display
    font in all lower-case letters without any of the funky, slanted characters. I'm
    pretty sure this is the font [[http://www.istockphoto.com/|istockphoto]] has been
    using for some time now, right?\r\n\r\nSo maybe one of you should create a suomi
    slab serif/inlove font combo . . . something simple to use as display text. .
    . . I would buy it."

    For istockphoto, don't think it's InLove, more probably [[http://www.impactolaser.com/index.php?/tipografia/rns-camelia/|RNS
