  body: "Check out the text type of Ethnos newspaper.\r\nYou can find a PDF of it
    at Newseum.org.\r\nThe letter forms are not the calligraphically-flavoured \"proper\"
    ones favored by the Leonidas school, but I think they would be suitable for a
    classic typewriter face, i.e. one strongly informed by the Modern style used at
    the time of the typewriter's invention.\r\n\r\nIn general: try to keep an even
    weight of line throughout the face.\r\nTry to figure out how to make the accents
    suitably \"blobby\", and still get them to fit, especially \"dieresis-tonos\".\r\n\r\nFor
    encoding reference, refer to WGL."
