  body: "<em>That\u2019s a slightly customised Formata.</em>\r\n\r\nI hate to disagree
    with you of all people, but it isn\u2019t. Formata has less oblique tops on the
    u, a much less curly spur on the g and not those sharp pseudo-serifs.\r\nUnfortunately,
    i hate those Optima-like hermaphrodites who don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re
    serif or sans, so im not going to look any further. I may have to come across
    Flange and other aberrations...\r\n\r\nOr it is very heavily customised, more
    of a sex-change."

  body: "I think heavily customised fits the bill. ;^) I was being too cautious.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I agree on the Optima-like hermaphrodites. I like my type to make up its mind
    and decide what to be."
