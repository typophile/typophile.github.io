  body: That's a Bright Ideas (defunct) font called Riesling - manually heavied up

  body: "I don't know what DrDoc means by \"what's the context\"? It was found online
    on someone's promo graphics. Most logo and type display graphics are customized,
    of course. I just want to know the base typeface. \r\n\r\nOk, just found it, and
    yes, Mike F was correct - it's Riesling. Thanks all - fast help as usual :)"
