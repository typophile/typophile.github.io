  anyone know the history of this font, and if there is a commercially available version?
  I haven't been able to track down the original designer/foundry, and it seems as
  though this particular typeface is no longer available. (Trying to reprint\u2014with
  corrections\u2014a legacy document for a client.)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\nD."

  body: After some very bizarre Google results, I think I've answered most of my question.
    The original foundry was Thirstype, which was then incorporated into [[http://vllg.com/|Village]];
    the designer is Barry Deck. But I'm still at a loss regarding alternatives that
    are still commercially available, as it seems that all of his typefaces have been
    pulled. Any thoughts?

    On top of all that, Chester Jenkins, who used to run Thirstype after Rick, apparently

  body: "This issue has been raised before, with many variations.\r\n\r\nWhat if someone
    buys a font, and their computer crashes and the font is lost? In many cases, just
    go to the vendor and download it again. Or you created a brand identity or logo
    and the original designer is unavailable or refuses to help. You look for the
    font, and it's nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nWhat if the font company goes out of
    business with no one picking up the assets? What if the font is abandonware? If
    I needed a font to <em>recreate</em> something already extant, as opposed to just
    <em>wanting</em> a particular font, there's no telling what I would do.\r\n\r\nIt's
    easy to to be an absolutist, pontificate, and say \"the worst thing is to help
    him download from illegal resources, as Renaissance Man did.\" I understand that
    people die, companies go bankrupt, foundries are taken over, and shit happens.
    In those cases, the legitimacy, morality, or legality of recreating a font (\"outline
    theft\") or downloading from \"illegal resources\" is less clear cut. If you want
    absolutes (and absolution) join the Republican party or the RC church.\r\n\r\nI
    would NOT recommend a questionable source if there was a legitimate alternative.\r\n\r\nThis
    is NOT about \"illegal resources,\" but what to do when all legitimate sources
    have dried up."

    I'm settled. In other instances, I've always attempted to contact the original
    foundry and/or designer, and failing that, looked for another cut of the typeface.
    (An example: OPTI Majer Irregular is no longer available, and is of questionable
    origin to start with, but was a legacy font picked by a client before I started
    working with them. We were able to replace that typeface with Filmotype Major
    across all uses.)\r\n\r\nIt is a bit ludicrous in the age of the Internet that
    legitimate (and paying) users of typefaces can't always find a straightforward
    way to compensate the owners of the intellectual property. But not doing so is
    still theft. That being said, a designer who allows their font to go \"out of
    print\" (as opposed to pulling the font because of some defect) is basically throwing
    money away\u2014while I believe many end users want to do the right thing, most
    will only do so if it's made painfully easy for them.\r\n\r\nAnd RM, I just saw
    your reply, and it is a difficult but relevant gray area\u2014what do you do when
    there are no legitimate options/resources left? Thankfully in this case, it didn't
    come to that. And that discussion is probably best left to its own thread."

    history with my client, and the scope of this project (being a single reprint
    of a long in-print book), he granted me a gratis license for use on this project
    only. The font is still not commercially available; if I wanted to purchase a
    new license for a new project, I would have to continue my quest, or find a new
    typeface. Had I been unsuccessful with the foundry, I would have tried to contact
