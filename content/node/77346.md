body: "A simple trick I resurrected from Graphic Arts class I took a couple decades
  (circa 1984-85) or so ago to reconstruct the partially obscured Indian head on the
  Porto-Power logo. 'Course back then it was a big process camera, lenses, photo paper
  etc. instead of a scanner and computer, but the Sharpie's still the same. ;)\r\n\r\nI
  scanned the original at 600 DPI and cropped it down to just the head.\r\nNext I
  printed it on a US Letter sheet, filling most of the page.\r\nSince my Mark One
  Eyeball could see most of it, where no Photoshop tool could pick it out of the dirt
  and other noise, I used a black Sharpie to color in all the black outline.\r\nThe
  final step was scanning that page at 600 DPI, making a much larger image that was
  relatively easy to magic wand.\r\n\r\nI set the tolerance as high as it could go
  and just get what I wanted. Even so I had to expand then contract the selection
  by 1 pixel to pinch out all the little holes PS was calling the same shade of black
  as the brown/grey crud. Minor touch-ups were needed all around but a whole lot of
  labor and time was saved and it looks great when scaled down to the size of the
  original scanned as 600 DPI.\r\n\r\nThe same trick should work well on any other
  text, line art or solid graphics, or even stuff that's not solid but you need to
  create a shape or mask from an image that's too noisy/busy or doesn't have enough
  contrast."

  body: "This is one I did, scaled down to 25% from the original 600 dpi scan.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/blackh-bad.jpg\r\n\r\nYou
    can see the results here http://typophile.com/node/77306 The re-created version
    is also 25% size.\r\n\r\nDoing this with a computer is much easier and faster
    than doing all the fiddly stuff with a process camera and film. :)"
