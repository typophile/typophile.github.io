  name Argot) won a TDC in 2003.\r\nRelato Sans and another in TDC award 2006. \r\nAnd
  now Lorena Serif yet another TDC award winner 2007!!!\r\n\r\nHere he has done it
  again with well a executed text system intended for newspapers. I particularly enjoy
  the efficient use of space and the sturdy lachrymal terminals. ('Georgia' for print???)\r\n\r\nMyFonts's
  Jan Middendorp interviewed the 'MAN' for the their February newsletter. Very well
  done. Check it out:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/rs/200702.html#typedesigner\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nMike
  Diaz\r\n\r\nPS 1... I wonder who the other TDC winners are. Any inside info???\r\n\r\n\r\nPS
  2... Is it just me? because the TDC website is ironically one of the ugliest websites
  ever! They gray on gray color scheme is dated, poor/low res sample showings, pain
  in the you-know-what navigation, and generally speaking the entire site does not
  really befit an organization who's aim is to highlight the best in typography."

  body: I've actually long wondered about the TDC site's design. It seems purposefully
    odd, and I can't quite decide if I like it or not. Largely, I find it difficult
    to navigate. But maybe there's some history I'm not aware of.

    where did you read that Lorena is a TDC winner?

    love the new Palatino Sans. I don't think its as revolutionary as touted but very
    well done! I love it. \r\n\r\nJordy> I think he is one of a few designers alive
    that really gets 'it'. I personally enjoy the Bohemia family- a very special blend
    of Baskerville, DeVinne, FatFace (and Times).\r\n\r\nThank you Peter and Dan for
    the inside scoop,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

    about this face- its compact and has friendly rounded corners but there is not
    a chance of halation. For drivers in bad weather it is really important to have
    as little interference as possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can come to states and
    re-do our ugly road signge here.\r\n\r\nCongrats to you!\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Thanks a lot, Mike!\r\n\r\nUp to now this typeface has only one style and
    is only used as a logotype for several enterprises. But it was designed with a
    lot more in mind.\r\n\r\nAt least I'm currently working on a regular version\u2026
    ;-)\r\n\r\nI think I'll post some more information about this in a new thread
    as soon as i've got the time.\r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\nHanno\r\n\r\n"
