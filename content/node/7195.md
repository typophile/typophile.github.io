  body: It&#39;s rather shocking that ITC doesn&#39;t include the alternate characters
    in <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=R75XH6KCTKXJ9KKME3TGE3AP1PKA7FDF&amp;sku=ITC2450"
    target="_blank">the Busorama it sells on its site</a>. That&#39;s true of all
    their older fonts, I guess. &#40;ITC Bookman, ITC Avant Garde, etc.&#41; I think
    they would do well to re-release these as OpenType with all the original characters
    included.

    version of ITC Busorama included alternates in the lowercase character slots.
    You&#39;d find it on an old Image Club LetterPress disc, if you can locate one...'

  body: Well, I am wondering if it would be commercially viable for  <BR>whoever owns
    the copyright. Me, I&#39;m a sucker for quaint 70s  <BR>faces with lots of alternates
    and swashes and the lot, but  <BR>maybe we <i>are</i> a minority. What is the
    current demand for  <BR>such faces?

  body: The New York Knicks did a promo using Avant Guard with the alternate cap A
    but since it was only one character someone could have drawn it.

    it since they own ITC. As for being commercially viable--whoever did the Macy
    Gray thing thought so, as did the person who posted the ID query. One thing is
    for sure about the font market: It&#39;s hard to guess what people will like.
    <BR> <BR>Personally, I think an old face like Busorama would be more viable if
    all the original characters were there.'

    like with a Flair?
