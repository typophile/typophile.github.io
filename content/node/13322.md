  our trip to Helsinki, and since we'll be quite far from home, we plan on staying
  more than just the conference days. Does anyone have any recommendations on type-related
  [or any other interesting] events that will happen in Europe close to ATypI? Conferences,
  workshops, exhibitions? I know \"Europe\" is a bit vague, but once you've crossed
  the Atlantic, a few more miles are no problem. ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Gerald, we sure will, but we plan on staying in Europe around one month before
    returning home. So we were thinking of traveling a little, since we can only have
    trips like that once every few years, because of distance and money. \r\n\r\nOh
    and by the way, your work is fantastic, I'm a fan :) "
