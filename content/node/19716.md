  a web page for a technology company.\r\n\r\nBeing a fan of Communication arts and
  How magazine I want to couple the ff Meta I have (which is very small) used in the
  nav with a subhead and headlines font.\r\n\r\nObviously, a bit more flavor that
  the plain meta would be welcome, but not too much.\r\n\r\nParisine and Lisbon have
  had some resonance, but really would love to see if any of you had ideas.\r\n\r\nI
  guess a bit more beauty than Meta, a bit more character, yet contemporary.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nwnf"
