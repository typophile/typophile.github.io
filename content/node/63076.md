  been playing around with layouts with the theme of maritme/maps in mind. i still
  have to nail it but the experiments are quite fun!\r\n\r\nanyways ive chosen frutiger
  for body text as i think it is clean, simple and clear, but im struggling with the
  headlines/sub heads. \r\n\r\ncan anyone suggest san serif that would be a nice compliment
  to frutiger?\r\n\r\nthanx in advance."
