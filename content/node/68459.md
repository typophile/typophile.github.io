  of type and web. I am looking for some good places to look for a job.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to work in book design/layout, but I enjoy all kinds of design. I'll be in
  NYC and Boston next month and would like to visit some places (I'll send out a little
  self promo piece prior to arriving). Anyone have any tips of some typographically
  fantastic design agency places?\r\n\r\nIf you know of some great places to work,
  and they aren't in NYC/Boston, please tell as well!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEvan\r\n\r\nhttp://www.evanmade.com"

  body: "If you\u2019re in need of an entry-level job you\u2019re barking up the wrong
    tree by going to New York. There are a lot of unemployed designers with years
    of experience who are taking work that pays less than a living wage. So unless
    your parents can pay your bills I suggest you look at cities with a better job
    market. If you really do want to work in New York it would be a good idea to update
    your portfolio to emphasize your web work and you need to get some Flash sites
    with actionscript gimmickry in there ASAP. There is very little paying print work
    in NYC these days-the last time I went to a studio that depends on print for revenue
    half the office was empty desks."
