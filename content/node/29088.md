body: A client of mine needs something done with a font named "General" but they do
  not have access to it since their previous designer disappeared. It is a Sans Serif
  font similar to Avenir. I would post a sample if necessary but the problem is not
  to identify the font but the foundry/designer. Any information would be useful.
  Thanks, leo.

    The designer, Kevin Dresser later changed his mind, and pulled the design, for
    reasons which are murky even to Thirstype.\r\n\r\nYou can contact Mr Dresser through
