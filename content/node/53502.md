body: "I have a client who requires a designer to create a set of illuminated medieval
  caps with specific proportions: W=100% H=150%. Typically illuminated caps are square.
  The letter should be in the top 75% of the rectangle. See? You're already interested.
  They don't need to be historically accurate or based on anything specific, just
  thematic and kinda fun. However it's only 26 letters and hey, no kerning or spacing
  to deal with. Windows TTF, separated into layers for color separation.\r\n\r\nDon't
  expect too much cash (you'll have to negotiate that with the client) but it's non
  exclusive. In other words, you can keep the font, sell it etc. This is a reliable
  client which I've worked with before. I just don't have the time to work on this
  project right now.\r\n\r\nContact me. I'm not the middleman or anything, I'll just
  pass you along to the client."
