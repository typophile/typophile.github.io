  to say hello for him. Anyone else wants to pass him a message? :^)"

    train to Gent, but I don't think I would've had anything interesting to say (I'm
    just an amateur & everything I know about typography is what I read in these forums).\r\nDid
    you spend all night talking about kerning, serifs, hyphens etc.? ;-)"

    some Lebanese food and then I showed them Gent by night. :^)

  body: "Hi all...\r\n\r\nTiffany--I got all your emails. That was just my automatic
    \"vacation\" message you were getting.\r\n\r\nGent was wonderful and Yves is very
    lucky to live there. He gave us a great evening walking tour of the downtown area.
    I don't think we actually talked about type very much. I tried to stump him by
    getting him to identify a somewhat obscure font on a sign (fat chance), but that
    was about it. Mostly we talked about Gent and differences between living there
    and the U.S., the design business and stuff.\r\n\r\nOh, and I finally got that
    beer he promised me three years ago. :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_4201_3685.jpg]\r\n\r\nEarlier
    in the day, before we met up with Yves, we visited the Plantin-Moretus Museum
    in Antwerp and got to see some of the few remaining Garamond punches:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_5591_5315.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'll
    try to post some stuff about the museum this week on my blog.\r\n\r\nThanks again,
    Yves, for the tour and everything."

  body: Copyright is one of my favourite stores, but to ne honest, I like the one
    in Antwerp better. It has very clean originazed sections & anybody who's interested
    in typography or graphic design just has to walk in & take the stairs to your
    right (for architecture take the left stairs). The one on Gent seems a little
    bit more "eclectic" which is in contrast to its concept. OK, so I have to admit,
    I lived in Antwerp for a couple of years & I when I go to the Copyright in Gent
    I rarely get passed the right corner ;-)

  body: "I went to Copyright (in Antwerp) today & bought \"Indie Fonts 3\" & \"The
    Best Of 1-Color + 2-Color Graphics\". Those 2 purchases filled up my customer
    card (with a discount of 47,something Euros on my next purchase). I went straight
    back to my section & took \"Made With FontFont\" home as well :-)))\r\nI really
    shouldn't be buying books anymore, my bookcase is completely filled, but I really
    couldn't resist. Copyright has this magnetic field around it that attracts me
    from miles away.\r\nCompletely off the subject, but I also bought a pluche Hamburger
    from Friends With You (I've had my eye on that one for a long time, but never
    found it so far).\r\nYves, do you know CityKingz in Gent? They also have great
    graphic books (if you're interested in other things than typography that is)?"
