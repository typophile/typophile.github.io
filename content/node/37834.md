  body: "In addition to what is written in the wiki, I might add another speculation
    about the origin of serifs, one that I heard in a documentary many years ago:
    the serifs were put at the extremes of the letters to reduce the possible erosion
    faced by outdoors writings, to make rain flow at the sides of the letter instead
    of stagnating and eroding at the bottom of the vertical parts.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.asroma.it/|A.S.
    Roma]], one of two Rome's soccer clubs, used Trajan in last year's team shirts
    for players names and numbers; this season's shirt it has a new, squarey sans
    serif font for names and numbers."
