  body: I think it is very nice. the colors choosen are not perhaps the best choice
    if this is for nightclubs, but ideal if this is for general businesses. Where
    is business oriented?

  body: 'the company distributes flyers to "display" at bars, shops and also clubs,
    but it''s for an "overall" audience (not party orientated). well my mothers tongue
    aint english, would you say "flyers2go" instead of "flyer2go"? the idea behind
    the name is that you have that displays in a bar, restaurant or so and take that
    flyers if you like one (same like gocard, but for "regular" flyer distribution
    not just free postcard style flyers). thanks: lars'

  body: Also, it is traditionally spelled "<em>fl<strong>i</strong>ers</em>" (with
    an 'i'), though in recent years "<em>fl<strong>y</strong>ers</em>" has become
    an accepted spelling variation.

  body: 'i guess it''s more "common" here in germany to say it like that (flyer2go),
    flyers2go "sounds wrong" because of the german genitive usage... can''t explain
    that in english. sorry :) ... so? no one else on the design itself? '

    body: "it somehow doesn't read nicely, it feels more like to seperate entities.
      the 2 doesn't seem to connect naturally to the GO. it might be because of the
      capitals in GO - have you tried lower case letters? \r\n\r\ni'm also not sure
      about whether the individual elements really add up to a logo. maybe putting
      the entire type onto the cards would help giving it a stronger overall shape
      / contour.\r\n\r\noverall it's a good starting point, but it's not good enough
      for the viewer to feel that it \"absolutely has to be that way, no alternative.\"
      (know what i mean?)"

  body: yep, i had 3 version. one on a single line and one where all elements are
    "on" the cards. i'll think about it and post a new version. thanks thomas.

  body: I like it. Not sure about the second card being transparent though. It's too
    subtle -- I think the difference in lightness is enough.

    by curtze) might be solved if the ''2'' were to be placed extending into the white
    space of the ''O''.'
