body: "There's been a lot of discussion about [[readability]] over the past few years,
  on Typophile and elsewhere, much of it focused on the question of whether readability
  can be significantly improved at the type design level, or whether we're looking
  at diminishing returns with no significant gains in reading speed and comprehension
  ahead of us.\r\n\r\nToday, while reading a book on animal perception and behaviour
  (<em>Animals in translation</em> by Temple Grandin), it struck me that we're going
  at this from the wrong end. Rather than designing new typefaces to try to gain some
  small improvement in readability of text, we should look at redesigning the human
  eye to make it much better at reading. I was prompted to this thought by the observation
  that, while human eyes have a concentration of cones in the round fovea at the back
  of the eye giving us sharp focused vision in a small circular area, many animals
  -- especially predators and prey in open plains -- have a horizontal concentration
  of cones, giving them a vertically shallow but much greater horizontal sharpness
  of focus. [This is why you often see e.g. sheep dogs lower their heads to observe
  a field of sheep: they are aligning their 'streak' of high focus sight.]\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to me that if human eyes were redesigned to have a similar horizontal concentration
  of cones instead of a round fovea, we would be able to massively extend the length
  of our saccadic jumps, and perhaps even read entire lines of text in a single fixation.
  Of course, this presumes we are dealing with horizontal text; Chinese and Mongolian
  readers may wish to have their new eyes fitted with vertical concentrations of cones.
  Actually, the ideal situation would be to have the arrangement user-adjustable,
  so that one could use a slider to move between a round fovea to a horizontal or
  vertical arrangement of cones depending on the task one was doing.\r\n\r\nOf course,
  many people might object to the idea of having their eyeballs surgically altered
  in order to improve reading speed, even more than they object to having their writing
  systems cut up and rearranged. But if we do eventually reach the stage of being
  able to cure blindness with artificial eyes, i.e. by plugging into the visual cortex
  and feeding it signals, one could conceivably have a set of reading eyes, just as
  one now has reading glasses, which would not replace your normal eyes but be carried
  about and plugged in when one wants to read something."

    if not better results as restructuring the retina (and I've mentioned it once
    or twice here and there): have dynamic typography that changes depending on where
    you're looking; text that's further from the fovea is simply set larger, to give
    more bouma resolution in proportion to acuity loss along the parafovea. Some simple
    eye-tracking hardware/software should do it.\r\n\r\n> sheep dogs lower their heads

    Rods are much better at detecting it than cones. Plus for humans, movement tends
    to come from the sides... Like if you ever have to drive through a blind intersection,
    look straight ahead.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm a big fan of speeding up reading, but\r\nI'm

  body: "Ah, but I don't drive :)\r\n\r\nActually, when you suggested that I should
    try looking away from something to better see movement, the first thing I noticed
    is just how still everything around me is. The movement of the fronds on the tips
    of the cedar branches is so subtle and gentle, you actually have to be staring
    straight at it to see it at all.\r\n\r\nShifting or dumping the rods to the left
    and right of the fovea would certainly be bad for many human activities. This
    is why the new eyes should be adjustable, or else there should be separate eyes
    for different tasks. People with vision problems have different kinds of glasses
    for different purposes, so it isn't difficult to imagine different kinds of artificial
    eyes, or eyes that adapt to particular tasks in the way that polarising glasses
    adapt to different light levels.* We would expect such a technology to correct
    vision impairment -- and won't that be a welcome end to the large-print edition!
    -- but why not also provide task-specific vision enhancement. You could also have
    driving eyes to go with your natty driving gloves, with extra rods to detect movement
    even faster.\r\n\r\n* Speaking of polarising, here's another thing I learned today:
    'Dung beetles can perceive the polarisation of moonlight'. That's incredibly cool;
    even cooler than redesigning eyeballs."

    on the scale and frequency. Because the greater general capacity of rods in detecting
    movement is well-established. Another anecdotal test: you can see the interlacing
    on certain computer monitors only via the parafovea.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of animal
    vision, one of the most impressive is that of the eagle: where the human lens
    can be made globally thinner or thicker to focus various distances on the fovea,
    the eagle's lens can change thickness all across its surface; the entire field
    of vision, not just the few degrees right in the middle, is kept in focus. Wait,
    maybe this sort of thing could be almost as good for reading as rod/cone stuff?

    no reason that we won\u2019t be able to do the same thing to bypass retinal problems,
    such as retinal tears. It would just take a camera and an understanding of what
    information needs to be fed to each neuron. This is only more complicated because
    there are many more neurons involved than with hearing.\r\n\r\nIf we\u2019re able
    to use a microphone to replace the initial step of hearing and a camera to replace
    the initial step of vision, then there\u2019s all kinds of possibilities to make
    modifications. For example, it\u2019s possible today with the cochlear implants
    to change the range of hearing. The normal range of perfect hearing is 20hz to
    20,000 hz. But what would happen if the inputs were changed to 0 to 50hz? Would

    cells, but the ratio goes down further from the retina. In the periphery the ratio
    between rods and ganglion cells are as high as 1000:1. \r\n\r\nUnder normal daylight
    conditions we only use the cones for vision, as there is too much light for the
    rods to be effective. In low light conditions we use our rods for vision. It is
    difficult to read in low light because there are no rods in the fovea. The ganglion

    a phenomenon called binaural hearing where the outer ear -which\r\nis of a telling
    complexity- plays a very large role.</em>\r\n\r\nBinaural hearing is the auditory
    processing that compares what each ear hears; it helps us to work out direction
    and distance of auditory signals. Binaural sound recording, using two or more
    microphones, has been around since the late 19th century, when it was first used
    in the telephone broadcast of live opera performances. Later there were expriments
    with binaural radio broadcasts on dual frequencies, which didn't catch on because
    it required listeners to have two radios, each connected to a separate earphone.
    Since the development of stereo, however, binaural recording techniques have advanced
    significantly. Binaural reproduction requires the listener to use headphones,
    because it utilises the natural crossfeed of the head: the recording technique
    mimics binaural hearing, so can only be properly appreciated when played back
    directly to the individual ears.\r\n\r\nSonic shaping of the ear, i.e. the reaction
    and adapdation of the muscles of the ear to sound -- presumably the aspect of
    binaural hearing to which Hrant refers --, is important when we're picking up
    sound signals from our environment, but when we're listening to binaural recordings,
    through headphones, we're being directly fed the information that we normally
    have to use the muscles in the ear to help us direct. Indeed, the headphones probably
    actively inhibit sonic shaping, which is applied in the recording process rather
    than in the listening process.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of on-the-fly, direct to
    brain signals from microphones, if one were to use a binaural recording model,
    would be getting the mix right, i.e. accurately matching the microphone-to-brain
    signal to the direction and distance of the external sound signal."

    you mentioned people have been doing already. Now, if the outer ear is missing,
    then you need a complex algorithm* to filter the incoming sounds as the natural
    ear would. In fact a big issue is that processing binaural sound is computationally
    intensive; at least when I was reading about it (some years ago, in a book about
    cutting-edge multimedia design) it wasn't possible to make the hardware both affordable
    and comfortable.\r\n\r\n* Although not nearly as complex as its counterpart in
