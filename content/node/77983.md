  am trying to find a single source that has a list of diacritical marks, their unicode
  and corresponding languages.\r\n\r\nWikipedia seems to have a good source of quantity
  but its not necessarily user friendly to sort through.\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic]]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    for this, though I admit I don't remember if he lists Unicode values for all of
    them. And of course, this is only for Western alphabets. You could also try the
    Unicode site itself \u2014 for instance:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf\r\n\r\nThough
    the code tables don't identify languages that the diacritics are used in, Bringhurst
    does, so between the two resources you may have what you need.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "The Wikipedia article about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-derived_alphabet|Latin-derived
    alphabets]] is the nearest single source I know (I'm assuming you are searching
    mainly for Latin script languages).\r\n\r\nFor deeper information, you can take
    a look on each letter and language article published in Wikipedia. Each [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A|letter
    article]] brings a table with diacritical combinations.\r\n\r\nAbout transliterations,
    there is an [[http://transliteration.eki.ee/index.html|excellent archive]] made
    by Thomas Pedersen. It's almost hidden in the Estonian Language Institute site,
    the same cited by Kentlew. \r\n\r\nI'm concluding a survey about glyphs needed
    to support all Latin-script languages and also phonetic systems (IPA, APA, etc.).
    Unhappily, I did not keep information about the languages, just took the glyphs."

    copyright claim is worded, one may not <em>use</em> the info for anything at all.
    Well, that's my understanding of it, anyway. (See \"About the Project\".)"
