  a few tables, and 200-300 words of text. I prefer the sans serif - FLAMA and was
  just wondering what fonts you all prefer for general purpose work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\narjun\r\n\r\n"

    cause it is available everywhere and imho the best systemfont. All the rest changes
    day by day.\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"
