body: 'One question &#40;related to my previous topic on arabic opentype features&#41;
  : does Word XP handle open type tables, and especially GSUB ? That is, if i create
  a GSUB table for my font, will I be able to use the substitution features in Word
  XP or does Word XP have its own features for handling substitution ? <BR> <BR>An
  other question : if i use the private area of Unicode and create a Opentype font
  with GSUB and Right To Left, is there a way to input these characters, with the
  substitutions according to the GSUB table, in Word from right to left ? <BR> <BR>Etienne'

  body: MS Office on Windows interracts with Uniscribe, the MS Unicode Script Processor,
    which provides OpenType Layout support for specific scripts. The level of OTL
    support relies on the version of Uniscribe in use; the Office 2003 version of
    Uniscribe is the latest released by MS. To date, Microsoft&#39;s focus has been
    on complex script support, not on sophisticated typography in general, so things
    like smallcaps, automatic ligature substitution etc. are not currently supported.
    This will apparently change in the next version of Windows. <BR> <BR>Directionality
    is a character property, which effectively means there is no way to make private
    use area characters right-to-left except in private software, i.e. you can make
    a tool that will layout specific PUA characters right-to-left, but you cannot
    expect any other software to treat those characters the same way. This is why
    it is called the <i>private</i> use area.

  body: Yes, by tool I meant some kind of text layout application or plug-in to another
    application, essentially something that would perform the role that Uniscribe
    performs for standard characters for your non-standard private use characters.
    <BR> <BR><i>So if I understand well, the only way to input RTL in Word is to let
    him think that what I am typing is arabic &#40;or hebrew&#41; ? </i> <BR> <BR>Or
    Syriac or Thaana. What is it that you are actually trying to do? If you are working
    with a script that is not yet encoded in Unicode but which would be a candidate
    for encoding, there may already be a proposal in the works and I could put you
    in touch with people working on this.

  body: 'Etienne, I just read the other thread and note that you are interested in
    Sogdian. My recommendation is to use the Unicode Syriac characters, since this
    will provide the closest transcription: the Unicode Syriac block includes special
    characters used to write Sogdian in the Syriac script, suggesting that there should
    be a one-to-one linguistic mapping of Syriac with the Sogdian letters that you
    want to support. Sorry I don&#39;t know more about Sogdian per se.'

    target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/arabicot/shaping.htm</a>&#41;
    : <BR> <BR> <BR>How the Arabic shaping engine works    <BR> <BR>The Uniscribe
    Arabic shaping engine processes text in stages. The stages are:  <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Analyzing the characters for contextual shape.   <BR>Shaping &#40;substituting&#41;
    glyphs with OTLS &#40;OpenType Library Services&#41;.  <BR>Positioning glyphs
    with OTLS.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>but &#34;where&#34; is the OTLS ? in the font
    or in Windows system ? &#40;or in Word ?&#41;, that is can I modify it or not
    ? <BR> <BR>To answer to your suggestion : arabic is OK, as Sogdian has far less
    letters than arabic and arabic IME&#39;s far more frequent than the syriac. The
    sogdian language was indeed transcribed in syriac by nestorians for liturgical
    means but it is a different issue : we are dealing here with the script, and more
    precisely, the way letters connect or not with each others. In this regard syriac
    might be interesting as I can see that it has a predefined OT features &#40;med2&#41;
    for letters non connecting to the left, that is exactly what I need.  <BR>But
    basically the problem is the same: if the list of letters with their connecting
    characteristic is within Windows or Word IME, I cannot modify them, while if it
    is in the font I can do it, with arabic or syriac. <BR> <BR>Or may be should i
    write a long calt feature, to modify the result of the init medi fina in the way
    i want, replacing the non connected arabic waw by the connected sogdian waw, the
    connected arabic &#40;farsi&#41; peh by the unconnected sogdian peh and so on

    software</i> <BR> <BR>Unless you use bidirectional override as specified in the
    Unicode standard. The Unicode control character &#34;Right-to-Left Override&#34;
    &#40;U&#43;202E&#41; forces the text to be entered right-to-left until the end
    of the paragraph or until you pop &#40;U&#43;202C&#41; the default directional
    formatting. The text engine must in that case take no notice of the code points
    of the characters when setting the input and rendering direction. <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Explicit_Directional_Overrides" target="_blank">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Explicit_Directional_Overrides</a>
    <BR> <BR>It is possible to see this behavior in a simple application like notepad
    in Windows. If you have activated RTL support in the system, you will have a context
    menu for inserting those and other control characters. This is also true for all
    text fields in applications that use this system function. <BR> <BR>MS Word, at
    least the 2003 version, has problems handling control characters. It prefers to
    keep the &#34;intelligent&#34; BiDi direction even if you insert a control character.
    <BR> <BR>It is, in theory, possible for a &#34;non-private&#34; application to
    let you force RTL or LTR on a style format level. Either for a run of characters
    or for paragraphs. Word processors like later versions of MS Word or OpenOffice
    Writer has the possibility to specify RTL in styles, but that seems to only influence
    the direction of arrow keys, put the pilcrow to the left etc., while the input
    direction still is bidirectional. <BR> <BR>A BiDi override on a markup level has
    been defined in the HTML standard since 1998 and it has been supported by browsers
    for a long time now. <BR> <BR>/m
