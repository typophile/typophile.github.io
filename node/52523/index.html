I believe the O is implanted and this could be a bad redrawing of his work. Note the structure of the W and the leg of the R. The weights are all over the place so it could have possibly been drawn/painted by a drunk signpainter : )

That gave me a chuckle! The logo as I've been given it, which is the image in my first post, (even though I asked for a high resolution image!) looks like it's a photo of a bad photocopy of a scan, which might explain some distorting effects. Certainly the U has bleached out a lot, becuase looking at the sign on the Playhouse building the counter of the U joins up to the spur; there isn't a gap as in the image above.

Thanks to all for your helpful posts. I still haven't found the font.</div>

When I saw the Albertus on the windows I figured they brought in someone to do some additional work and they probably said "can you emulate this?" But as I said if you look at the stem to serif transitions you can definitely see the relation. When I first looked at your attachment the Albertus alarm went off because some of the critical characters are direct draws with perhaps a little bit of inexperience with thick and thin thrown in. The upper left join of the N is different and the terminals of the E, C and S don't match but that is why I said he/she was inexperienced. If you look at the playroom piece you can see the same small O that is monoline and the "serif" structure I am talking about.

But then it could just be an ugly free font : )

		<div class="commentbody">No, the logo on the window is surely based on Albertus (but it's for "Playroom").
The main "Playhouse" logo is surely handlettered, no matter bad or good.
They should give you the logo, otherwise they do not care in the first place, it seems…</div>
