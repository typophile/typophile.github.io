body: "Hi, \r\nI'm looking for a nice sans-serif to combine with Plantin (roman and
  italic, running text, 11/13). Can anyone explain to me what i should keep in mind
  when i try to combine sans and serif?  Is it just a feeling or are there some general
  rules? i can imagine X-height and colour hasve to be more or less equal, or is this
  not necessary? Should there be a contrast instead?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    and audience. Tell us more about the project.

    of the city where the workingclass lived. the sans-serif would be used for tables.

    have the same nice wide cast as Plantin, plus oldstyle figures, if you use them
    with your Plantin.
