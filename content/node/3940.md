body: Hi All, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m developing a logo for a Marketing Community website
  called marketshare. The logo will be mainly for website use, but may appear on the
  back of textbooks. Type is set in Horatio EF, ITC Avante Garde Gothic and the exclamation
  point is set in Albers-ArchiType. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m worried that the Avante Garde
  &#40;logos on the left &amp; bottom&#41; is a little too business and not enough
  fun. I also find the &#34;s&#34; to be a little condenced compared to the rest of
  the letters. <BR> <BR>I like the logos using Horatio &#40;logos on the right&#41;
  but I&#39;m wondering if they look a little too mid 70&#39;s retro. <BR> <BR>Any
  comments would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3153.gif"

  body: ' ymmy. I like the horatio. Simply because it gives your mark more of it&#39;s
    own look, makes it more unique. This grl likes the flat color as opposed to the
    blends. I like the top left one the best, but with the horatio instead of avant
    garde. &#40;or&#41; I like the middle one, sans blend, sans white stroke, but
    &#34;share&#34; in gray. I&#39;d flop the shape so the speak balloon point &#40;thingy,
    sheesh!&#41; is more of an entry point as opposed to an exit point. &#40;&#40;what
    a muck of a crit!&#41;&#41; Nice '

    one of the bottom pair.  I think that grey colour looks great with the green,
    but I don&#39;t know if you can work it into those two or not. <BR> <BR>I like
    both fonts...I don&#39;t know if one is any better than the other, but they do
    have slightly different feels, and you&#39;ll have to evaluate them along those
    lines. <BR> <BR>Paul D '

  body: ' I think it works good the secong version of avant gade in two colors, the
    one with the white line in the balloon, and i wouldn&#39;t worry about getting
    too serious because the baloon gives the fun that it should need. <BR> <BR>I agree
    that th one with horatio looks too 70s. <BR> <BR>CG '

  body: ' I like any of the ones with the name inside the speech balloon. I am concerned,
    though, about what might happen to readability if this were printed much smaller
    or sloppier, as usually happens in a phone book or newspaper ad; or if it&#39;s
    embroidered on a t-shirt or ball cap, as marketing people love to do.  The e in
    both Avant Garde and Horatio could easily close up. I looked at some possible
    substitutes '

  body: ' Thanks for the feedback guys. <BR>The client has gone for the safe choice
    and picked Avante Garde. They also went for the logo within the large word bubble.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately they weren&#39;t big fans of the color scheme, so I have
    to do some exploring in that direction. The l/c &#34;s&#34; in Avante Garde is
    still really bothering me so I think I will play with it a little. Does anyone
    else agree that the &#34;s&#34; looks a little on the thin side? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    think the logo will be reproduced at exceedingly small sizes so I&#39;m not too
    worried about the &#34;e&#34; closing up, but thats a great point Christopher. '

    the geometric essence of AG. So maybe don&#39;t let it bother you - chances are
    it only bothers type geeks anyway... And maybe it&#39;s crying out to be morphed
    into a dollar sign in some future application? <BR> <BR>hhp '
