body: I have a document from 1881 - the design of a ship that we have excavated. At
  the top of the mast plan it says - Masts &(not this ampersand but the handwritten
  one that looks like the greek alpha) and this is followed immediatly by a superscript
  underscored e then it gives a No. 130. Does anyone know what this underscored e
  might have stood for about 130 odd years ago??

  body: Are you sure it's an e? It sounds like it could be "&c" (et cetera).
