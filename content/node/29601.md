body: "I am an illustrator who has become a regular reader of Typophile in order to
  learn as much about typography as I can. I have a great deal of respect for the
  knowledge-base that is open to sharing here on this board.\r\n\r\nI have designed
  a large-display emblem for a salon and I need your help on the text portion of the
  emblem. Currently, I am using Rosewood Fill; however, it is getting a little too
  much play these days and I would like to support a different font and its designer.
  I am aware of Cam, but it doesn't rock my world. I would like to go for something
  that complements the ornate emblem and personifies luxury. The font should work
  both within the emblem and on its own. I don't think Rosewod Fill works well on
  its own for a salon, at least not one that is high-end. Maybe I am asking too much
  for a font to work in both applications, so the more important application is in
  the emblem.\r\n\r\nMy second question is what font(s) do you think work well in
  this context to accompany the emblem? It should have the feel of luxury like a font
  that would work well in high-fashion. The font shouldn't compete with the ornateness
  of the graphic. Price is not an issue.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus question, I understand
  Rosewood Fill needs to be kerned manually, I have little knowledge of this other
  than what looks natural to me, so I ask you to critique the job I have done.\r\n\r\nI
  thank all of you who openly share your vast knowledge of typography here on this
  board. It greatly helps those of us who may be proficient in other areas, but lack
  when it comes to typopgraphy.  "

  body: Cool, I like it a lot except for one thing. The name needs to be bigger. As
    it is now the overall "illustration/decoration" is getting far too much attention.
    I would have the name split in two words in order to make it biggger. The siccors
    could then be smaller and still be seen. The compact whiteness still make sure
    they are visible enough. The typeface itself is ok in my opinion. Good luck.
