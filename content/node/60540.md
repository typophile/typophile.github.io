  body: "Well, I don't want to be harsh but the only ambigrams here are the DIK and
    MEW. \r\nAmbigrams are words that after rotating them 180 degrees look the same...
    None of MAM symbols does that, neither jimmy (even though I like it most).\r\nAnd
    besides - it probably wasn't very hard to make a MEW ambigram, huh? ;)\r\n\r\nIf
    I'm wrong - let me know. I'm not 100% sure...\r\n- Filip \u0141ysyszyn"

  body: "Yes, indeed. MEW was easy. :D\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, I'm affraid you are wrong.
    because actually there are many types of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram|ambigrams]]:\r\n-
    MAM is a 'mirror-image' ambigram.\r\n- jimmy/minim is a 'mirror-image', 'rotational',
    'symbiotogram' and 'natural' ambigram."
