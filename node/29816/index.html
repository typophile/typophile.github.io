  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m in the roots process of creating a new identity system for myself, and wanted to know what the growing consensus on some topics were.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My name versus a clever amalgamation  example: Andrew Sipe Vs Clever Amalgamation Designs
Is this professional? Is it acceptable? Is it the way to go if I&rsquo;m the only person using it, i.e. no other employees in this company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tagline : Yes or No or should I just use a title like graphic artist/designer/communicator? 
Is it necessary to have a tagline/title line at all when creating a personal identity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some resources or guidelines I should consider familiarizing myself with when creating my identity system. I&rsquo;m guessing there isn&rsquo;t much difference between a personal ID system and a professional company ID system, but I could be mistaken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have more questions as this topic develops out, until then I&rsquo;d be happy to read your honest insights and opinions on the subject.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh, Clever Amalgamated Designs is just a spoof title for example purposes only.</p>
<p>I guess going any root is perfectly fine then. I was kinda hoping there might be more of an argument against the common &ldquo;so-and-so design&rdquo; formula a lot of artist/designers use when creating a personal identity. Perhaps an argument like:</p>
<p>• The artist/designer who tacks on &ldquo;design&rdquo; shows little creative energy to their own personal identity, might translate to showing the same energy for the customer&rsquo;s projects&hellip;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>• the artist/designer who uses their own name as the company name might translate to having an egocentric attitude&hellip;</p>
<p>or for it</p>
<p>• there could be positives to using their own name, especially if the artist/designer is well known or their name is extremely unique and would lend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure, I don&rsquo;t want to come off as pompous and I don&rsquo;t want to seem immature or under experienced to potential clients/new employers. If I use a name other than my own, I&rsquo;d have to justify it some way, at least in my own mind.</p>

I know its hard but I just feel these words are being used too freely, incorrectly and are starting to lose meaning (kind of like the ever popular swoosh on a &lsquo;professional&rsquo; logo as a visual element).</p>
<p><cite>The artist/designer who tacks on “design” shows little creative energy to their own personal identity, might translate to showing the same energy for the customer’s projects…</cite></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p><cite>the artist/designer who uses their own name as the company name might translate to having an egocentric attitude…</cite></p>
<p>Who says you have to be a &lsquo;company&rsquo;? Just be honest with yourself and you&rsquo;re clients will see it. Don&rsquo;t try to be something your not (not saying you are BTW). It&rsquo;s just you. And if you feel that this might come off as amaturish or small then it&rsquo;s your job to convince potential clients that staying small allows for a more personal and effective design approach. Which i feel it does.</p>
<p><cite>there could be positives to using their own name, especially if the artist/designer is well known or their name is extremely unique and would lend.</cite></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be well known. Personaly I would just use your name. It has a certain &lsquo;ring&rsquo; to it.</p>
<p>When designing my identity I wanted to emphasize my bilingual design skills. I used two methods. The first was my name Ivan Melendez. The second was the word &lsquo;graphic design&rsquo; (not graphic designer) in both english and spanish seperated by a virgule. 
I used a simple typographic logo (the letter &lsquo;M&rsquo; surrounded with different glyphs set in differnt fonts) to emphasize the heavy influence typography has on my work.</p>
<p>Keep it clean and simple. In fact, the less info the better in my opinion. It allows for questions about what you do, that&rsquo;s your opportunity to impress them with what you have to say. Much better than having the things you do on a card. In my case. I chose not to use the word &lsquo;typography&rsquo; or &lsquo;typographer&rsquo;, not many people know what it is or how important it is to effective design.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense. In the end it&rsquo;s really up to you. As you grow you can always change your identity to reflect such growth.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Excellent response Ivan. I think you made some very clear comments on the topic. The approach of going as minimalistic as possibly leaves lots of room for additions as the application calls for them. I&rsquo;ve been parallel in my directions always approaching the idea from the same angle, and assuming I need specific elements.</p>
<p>I have a symbol and I think I&rsquo;ll continue to use my name. I have the website I might as well use it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post it soon for review (in a separate topic). I still think there&rsquo;s still more conversation left for this topic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting question &ndash; I&rsquo;ve gone through a number of incarnations of my self-employment over the years and kept the main element and central name while changing the rationale as technology has changed.</p>
<p>At first, I never had a logo (back in the early 80s), and since then, I&rsquo;ve used a range of &ldquo;L&rdquo; variations.  The latest one is a black cap in some Celtic-ish font, enclosed in a circle of a Pantone orange, with the rest of the text in Albertus.</p>
<p>The trick, I think, is finding the right name to start with: I was lucky enough to find one that reflected my <em>zeitgeist</em> and still started with &ldquo;L&rdquo;&hellip;.  ;-)  YMMV, as they say.</p>

<p>Why? It was brain-dead simple, looks fine, and didn&rsquo;t entail me spending months dwelling on whether or not my identity was &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; (because you can never make your own identity &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;.) ;o)</p>
<p>As for your arguments, I honestly don&rsquo;t think too many folks&ndash;be it other designers or just clients in general&ndash;put that much thought into your company name. They work with you because of YOU&hellip;not because of your logo.</p>
<p>Finally, using your name has one simple benefit&hellip;it&rsquo;s your name. Makes it a bit easier to remember who you are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have struggled with this also Asvetic. Personally, if it can be helped, I would avoid using words like ‘design’, ‘studio’, ‘communication’, ‘solutions’ altogether. I know its hard but I just feel these words are being used too freely, incorrectly and are starting to lose meaning (kind of like the ever popular swoosh on a ‘professional’ logo as a visual element).&rdquo;</p>
<p>I somewhat agree with that, but, that said, there&rsquo;s a very practical common-sense reason TO use it as well: it explains what you are.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s Plumbing? Oh yea, he&rsquo;s the plumber.
Sam&rsquo;s Catering? Oh yea, he&rsquo;s the person doing lunch for us.
Sara&rsquo;s Design? Oh, she must be the one handling the invitations for us.
Happy Purple Frog Co.? Umm&hellip;I can&rsquo;t remember what they were doing&hellip;was that the lawn maintenance crew?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You have a point Aluminum (love the logo BTW). I agree that there are common-sense reason in using descriptive company names. I just feel the words I mentioned are being used entirely too much in the realm of art &amp; design. I think it would only result in a &lsquo;me too&rsquo; kinda feel. It&rsquo;s such a matter of personal space. There are no set rules, no right and wrong answers.</p>
<p>I live in Reading PA (will be attending Kutztown University in the near future Asvetic) and there are several &ldquo;design studios&rdquo; in the area who&rsquo;s work I can only describe as craptacular. Almost all off them use the word &lsquo;design&rsquo;, &lsquo;studio&rsquo; or &lsquo;communication&rsquo;. My choice to not use these words came from the desire to seperate myself from this group, and it&rsquo;s worked. That&rsquo;s not to say I would not choose to use one of these words if my business would grow and have employees under my direction. But I would have to had developed a solid reputation for myself in order for that to happen so I won&rsquo;t be mistaken for a lesser studio.</p>
<p>Asvetic we should talk some time and colaborate on future projects (currently working on somethings for the Reading Hospital).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know Hrant, cant seem to get past the name either. Pretty bad. Igor doesn&rsquo;t seem to exude confidence, strength. Saw the web site and can&rsquo;t help but laugh a little. For a company that emphasizes brand strength they sure put the name &ldquo;Igor&rdquo; on everything. Like &ldquo;Igor agency&rdquo;, &ldquo;Igor naming guide&rdquo;, &ldquo;Igor-created&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Igor Naming and Branding Meta Blog&rdquo;. Very redundant.</p>
<p><cite>Have you done any strategy forming for your company yet? What are your goals, the feel of your company, etc.<cite/></p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t really formed any strategies, since I&rsquo;m realtively new at this, I figured I would allow the flow of specific work to guide what my &lsquo;company&rsquo; will do primarily. I am leaning towards strengthening the bilingual aspect of my work as most of my work involes designing in both languages for clients. I will say, however, that I never refer myself as a company (it&rsquo;s just me and it&rsquo;s too corporate in my opinion. Besides, what if someone asks me how many people are in my &ldquo;company&rdquo;? I&rsquo;ll have to say &ldquo;just me&rdquo;, and look silly in my opinion)</p>
<p>Which brings me to the second question. My goal is to offer effective design without all the  &ldquo;fluff&rdquo;. In the area I live in I&rsquo;m often faced with &ldquo;design solutions&rdquo; that really don&rsquo;t do much, don&rsquo;t function. I also try to tackle what I call relevant design issues. In other words, I look to make designs that are truly useful and long lasting in their benefit. For example, I&rsquo;m currently designing bilingual patient information forms for a hospital who&rsquo;s number of hispanic patients grow every day. I really enjoy this job because I feel I&rsquo;m doing good work. I&rsquo;m not trying to sell someone something they don&rsquo;t need, or designing for something or someone I don&rsquo;t belive in. I&rsquo;m designing something that will aid in effective healthcare.</p>
<p>The feel I&rsquo;m trying to send out is approachability (which is why i&rsquo;ll always try to stay small). That anyone can approach me with a design problem, big or small, and expirience the same level of passion and dedication. I also allow my design to take on a humanistic approach. Often relying on the emotion behind it all to guide me to a solution. Yes, form design may seem boring to some and it&rsquo;s pretty unglamourous, but to me I think about the patient who is scared and confused when coming into the hospital and has a difficult time communicating because of the language barrier. That drives me.</p>

<p>There is a very simple strategy article. Narrowing down everything will help you pick a name, design a logo, determine colour choices, etc. Bilingual Aspect, No Fluff, humanistic approach, etc. are all good things to narrow your goals.</p>
<p>Also you might want to look at Bauhaus Design which was design for a purpose that was supposed to be affordable so that everyone could enjoy good design. Also maybe Edward R Tufte if you do a lot of information design.</p>
