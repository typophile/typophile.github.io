  for a photographer.\r\n\r\nThe client likes to give the impression of being a person
  and not a company, and therefore doesn't want over the top branding. It was therefore
  my job to come up with something simple and to the point.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind
  I simply want to focus on creating a logo that was simple yet recognizable (as it
  will also be used as a watermark on his images). So far I have been playing with
  the his name and have come up with the following 4 alternatives.\r\n\r\nComments,
  suggestions, critique welcome by all...\r\n\r\n:)"

    this statement, then look at your current typeface choice. Normally I'm usually
    all for Helvetica, it's a classic, but in this instance it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nYou
    need a typeface with more warmth, charisma and character. Helvetica is the complete
    opposite of what you're going for. \r\n\r\nAs for the wordmark, creating a ligature
    to connect his first and last name doesn't seem to be a solution. Ultimately,
    you are turning the name into a company. To remain in your concept of creating
    a personal logo and not a company logo, you really need to keep his first and
    last names separate. Craig Nye is a person, craignye isn't. \r\n\r\nAlso could
    you elaborate more on what you or your client consider over-the-top branding. "

  body: "I was trying to work out what the nye stood for...New York what? I agree
    with avestic - its not really working as a personal logo, it looks like a corporation
    based in NY.\r\n\r\nMost photographer's logos i know of are very clear on a first
    name last name distinction and much simpler than your initial jpg. Its an interesting
    name your working with, i wouldn't try and be too fussy with it."

  body: "The four alternatives are all (more or less) the same. As mentioned above
    helvetica is not an ideal way to sell personality. \r\n\r\nPresuming that [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/craignye/|this]]
    is him I think that maybe you could try to incorporate the style of photography
    that he does.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine a lovely decorative signature working with
    his photographs or even muted, cool helvetica. Maybe be more energetic and vigorous
    with the style of writing in order to communicate the energy that a lot of his
    photos have! \r\n\r\nTry writing his name using ink and a blunt stick, and don't
    be shy with the ammount of ink and the energy that you put into it. The more expressive
    and energetic the better!\r\n\r\n \r\n"
