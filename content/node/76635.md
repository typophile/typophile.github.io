  having to use the two command cut & paste in Fontlab as I can do in Illustrator
  by using the \u201Calt\u201D key, selecting an object and simply dragging it?\r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: You could use ALT+Insert, but then you'd have to decompose. On the other hand,
    if you're on a PC, the right-click context menu is faster and simpler than the
    CTRL+C, CTRL+V method...

  body: You should be able to assign a keyboard shortcut to the Duplicate command,
    inside of the Customize dialog. Command/Control-D is set to Deselect by default,
    but that can be changed or deleted. You can also adjust the Duplicate offset (how
    far from the original the copy appears) in the Preferences under Glyph Window
    > Dimensions.

  body: 'Great and thanks to all of you for your tips. I''m on MAC, I had not thought
    the Duplicate command.  By default my Deselect command is  Cmd-U so Cmd-D to duplicate
    will works perfectly to me. '

  body: Just checked and Cmd-D is already assigned to Duplicate on my set up. Forgot
    about that one. Thanks for the reminder.
