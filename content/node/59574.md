    designed for signage:\r\n\r\n<a href=http://www.linotype.com/469/frutiger-family.html>Frutiger</a>
    is the print version of what was once a signage face, Alphabet Roissy. Of course
    FF Info is Erik Spiekermann's reworking of Frutiger.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://keithtam.net/types.html>Arrival</a>

  body: "A bit off topic, but per the discussion of FF Transit.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000240.html>From
    Erik Spierkermann:</a>\r\nTo be really boring:\r\nAdrain Frutiger didn\u2019t
    design a family of faces for Charles de Gaulle airport, but just the one weight
    for signage. That airport opened in 1976 (not 1968) when it was still called Roissy.
    Linotype then went and made Frutiger into the (almost) complete family and released
    it in the early 80s. I designed a condensed version (with Linotype\u2019s license
    and Frutiger\u2019s blessing) for Berlin Transit in 1990, called FF Transit. If
    Frutiger Condensed had been available in digital form at the time, i wouldn\u2019t
    have bothered. We also did a \u201Ctrue\u201D Italic (as opposed to a sloping
    Roman, which is what Frutiger himself always does), because we needed more distinction
    for a second level of information on our signs. Frutiger himself liked that Italic,
    but told me that he just didn\u2019t do those himself. The new version from Linotype,
    Frutiger Next, now has true Italics! It\u2019s nice to be right, now and again."
