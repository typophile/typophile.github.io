  This semester I'm taking portfolio prep and we have to brand ourselves. I'm by far
  my own worst customer. I cannot find a font that suits me. Here is what I'd like
  to convey:\r\n\r\n-Sophistication\r\n-Yet light-hearted and a bit sweet\r\n-Simple\r\n\r\nI
  want to be a textile designer so I was thinking that the font probably needs to
  contrast with the potentially overwhelming designs. It will probably need to be
  a little bold and really simple. \r\n\r\nOne of the main problems is that my name
  (Mikelle Williams) has so many of the same letters and the \"e\"s and the \"i\"s
  next to the \"l\"s look weird. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks a million,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikelle"

    what you mean :-P\r\n\r\nYour three rules are really a good starting point. It
    rules out neutral fonts (Helvetica, Calibri, Minion, Palatino), all sans (Myriad
    <em>et al.</em>) and a good deal of serifs (Times, Jenson, all Garamonds). Why
    not try a few sturdy, bold script fonts? [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/brody/|Brody]]
    came to mind, as it has well-defined, thick curves, nice capital 'M's and 'W's,
    and big loopy 'l's, which are clearly different from the 'i'. I'm just not wild
    about its 's'. Perhaps you could change it to a real one, with a huge end flourish."

    with some of Today Sans and some other possibly useful fonts. It also includes
    templates for MS Word. This page indicates that the software installs all the
    fonts for you, which you may not like. A good price though. This Ascender Pack
