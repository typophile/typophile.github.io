    afraid to think like this! This is what flash was made for. Well, SHOULD have
    been made for.\r\n\r\nAnd I've been a HUGE fan of Martin's work for years, so
    much that I bought a stack of every issue of SPEAK magazine (where he wuz designing)
    after it went under.\r\n\r\n(He designed an issue that full of scanned cherry
    stems from eaten cherries - that was really cool)"
