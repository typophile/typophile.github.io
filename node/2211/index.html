<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am from America and I was listening to a radio station today raising money for feeding people who are poor. It was started by Harry Chapin and the co-founder was discussing the people who are contacting the organization for help. It seems that the majority of cities that have been contacting the organization are from army bases. Families of soldiers are poor and need help to be fed, why, because the men who joined the army don't have educational skills other than being soldiers. Its a shame. The Bush administration should be ashamed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The army provides PLENTY of educational opportunities. I paid for school via the Army. The reason they don't make a lot of money is because they don't get paid a lot as soldiers. As Caleb mentions, this has been going on for a long time. Though Bush hasn't done anything to change that he has arguably made it worse. <br> <br>But, really, what does this have to do with typography? Isn't their a better forum for this type of post?</div>
