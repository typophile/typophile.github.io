  a number of workshops across a range of digital and social media subjects.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo is to be used online and in print in the UK and the US. I've used MetaPlus
  Black Italic which I've chosen for it's robust and modern feel. However I haven't
  yet touched the type which is where I'm hoping your learned opinions will come in.
  Aside from kerning I'm interested in any minor adjustments i could or should make
  to the type to a) make it unique  and b) help it sit together most comfortably.
  Of course I 'm only looking to improve rather than change for the sake of it so
  if the consensus is 'it isn't broken' I'll leave it more or less as is.\r\n\r\nMany,
  many thanks in advance, your opinion is appreciated\r\n\r\n"

    the box encasing makes a point like that of a ''mouse'' pointer. could expand

  body: "that's actually a very nice idea. \r\n\r\nThe box is indeed meant to represent
    papers - bit double edged, 1) to juxtapose the 'digital' part of the name and
    2) to give a gentle nod to the academic nature of the business"
