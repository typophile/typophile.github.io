  body: I have found whatthefont to be pretty useless. <BR> <BR>Are you sure this
    is a font? If it&#39;s a logo, someone might have added the stenciling themselves.
    You could get a pretty close approximation with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frankfurter/frankfurter/testdrive.html?s=DERRICK&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Frankfurter</a>.

  body: This reminds me of an old Mecanorma dry-transfer face - but the completely
    name escapes me at the moment and I can&#39;t seen to locate my old MN catalog.
    Dang. <BR> <BR>Mark! Mark Simonson! This one&#39;s for you...
