<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>okay, so i know that Mr. Frederick Nader is rather infamous on these forums, but i was cruising all my old font links today and noticed that he had a rather interesting article up on apostropic lab's website here: <a href=http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/articles/ot.htm target=_blank>http://www.hardcovermedia.com/lab/articles/ot.htm</a> <br>i was wondering if there had already been some discussion along these lines (since i'm new to these forums) that anyone could point me to. I think Mr. Nader makes some interesting assertions and would love to read some further commentary on the topics addressed in this article. (oh, and if you want a laff, check out the article on how many font designers it takes to change a light bulb, hilarious!)</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>What do I think of the article? I think that those readers who enjoy recreational drugs should ask him to share, since obviously he's got some pretty powerful stuff. <br> <br>Many of the assertions in this article are simply factually false, and many others are misleading at best. Plus he's got some axes to grind. The combination makes it pretty absurd. There are a couple of other folks out there who operate in a similar alternate universe, but luckily none of them are all that prominent. <br> <br>I seem to recall that there are some perfectly good points as well in there, but it's hard to distinguish them from the rubbish. I suppose I could go through it again... (shudder). <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>LOL, I was hoping you would enlighten me, Thom, on which points were valid! The part that intrigued me, I guess, was the artist vs. the programer notion, just simply because i'm not much of either! I realize that Mr. Nader's philosophy & practices run contrary to the majority, but i was hoping for some level headed discussion about some of the issues he addresses, i realize that this article is written as a propaganda (just check out that closing line!) but can i just have some commentary on this to help sort out the facts sans the drama. (I hate drama, unless it's a good classic tragedy) So no name calling! I just want the facts and some good solid opinions. Or is that too much to ask?</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Oh, fine, I'll dissect the article. <br> <br>First off, it's certainly true that with the *current* state of OpenType development tools, it takes a moderately technical mindset to develop feature-ful OpenType fonts with lots of goodies. <br> <br>That being said, one of the beauties of OpenType is that it frees the type designer from the arbitrary character set and encoding constraints of Type 1 and TrueType (though at least TrueType had more flexibility on the language support side). Speaking as a designer, if I want to throw in just one extra ligature or a couple of alternate characters or whatever into my font, I can. <br> <br>The new technology doesn't remove the critical role of the type designer any more than any other type technology has done. To be sure there is a new kind of technical type development role, for people who know how to make OpenType features work, but the general category of technical type development roles as distinct from type designers has existed for at least a century, perhaps more. <br> <br>On to other stuff, from the top.... <br> <br> <br>I disagree with Nader's opinion of how "the user" is the lowest common denominator and is responsible for the degradation of technologies and typography. If this were true, each technology would go downhill from the time of its introduction (created by engineers and designers) until being replaced by something else. In fact, each technology has generally improved steadily, being ever refined, until replaced by something else that offers some significant advantages, even though the new tech has some rough edges. Those rough edges are generally fixed over time. The first DTP was pretty bad in some ways, mostly due to resolution limitations. But it improved. <br> <br>Nader claims that OpenType makes it possible to do "things like report usage statistics to the manufacturer through online connections, keep logs of certain things, conduct machine surveys, enforce usage parameters, and all kinds of actions that some people might consider malicious, intrusive, or reckless." <br> <br>This is almost entirely untrue. The only "usage parameter" existent in OpenType that I can think of is the fsType embedding bit, which specifies the type developers' desires as far as how the fonts can be embedded. This is present in TrueType as well, so is not new to OpenType. The rest as far as I know is pure fantasy, but to whatever extent it is true it would be true only of TrueType flavored OpenType, and only to the exact same extent it's true of TrueType. <br> <br>"Open Type technology itself is in fact so open that it is certainly possible to place a viral element inside a font, or make the font activate or deactivate system modules or, as has already been proven, even cause a machine to restart itself no matter what tasks are running or which work has been saved." <br> <br>Again, this is largely nonsense. Until recently, it was possible to make a font in any major format (Type 1, TrueType, OpenType with either kind of outlines) that would cause Windows to blue screen or reboot. These security problems have been solved. However, there was nothing "viral" about it, it was simply bad fonts that could cause crashes. No self-replication or infection of any sort. Also nothing particularly unique to OpenType. <br> <br>However, I do think that Nader is largely right that if user's expectations go way up, it will be hard on type designers who have to produce a lot more glyphs. Today's better tools will reduce the time to add more glyphs, but it's still a noticeable extra amount of work. It is not clear to me that this change will happen, as there are an awful lot of existing typefaces that do not have tons of extra goodies, and many of those don't particularly need to be extended to a bigger glyph complement. <br> <br> <br> <br>I mostly disagree about the comments about IP. These are at most extensions to existing works, not clones or knockoffs. The comparisons made here are inappropriate. <br> <br>Nader's claims about Lithos are misleading at best, as Carol was personally involved in the extensions to her design. The "figure variations" are not oldstyle figures, but simply smaller versions of the full-size figures, to go with the small caps. Adobe does generally credit the people who do major extensions to typefaces, which is why Myriad Pro now lists Fred Brady and Christopher Slye, who did the Myriad Pro Cyrillic and Greek coverage (respectively) with Robert Slimbach as art director. <br> <br>I agree that as type tech advances there have been tradeoffs and we've had to give up things to gain other things. But what almost always happens is that some of those things that have been sacrificed are able to come back as the next generation of technology improves. <br> <br>The speculation that the "underground" might somehow as a group tend to outdo the above-ground developers in typographic innovation is pretty laughable to me. After all, the average shareware font has significantly less than a full Win-ANSI or MacRoman character set. Probably a few people will do some very cool stuff, but the existence of cool technology won't change the average state of shareware. How many superhinted TrueType fonts have you seen as shareware? <br> <br>The last section ("what are we sacrificing?") is pretty fantastical to my mind, and hardly worth commenting on. <br> <br>So, those are my thoughts. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, I disagree. <br> <br>Opentype has made so-called "fine typography" accessible for the people, and not only those that speak English. (I think the trend for making fonts for the world and not just the few that speak English is a positive trend in the world of typography.) I see nothing wrong with that. <br> <br>It has also made some of the minutiae of typography a little easier. I also see nothing wrong with that. At the end of the day, even with opentype fonts, the designer/typographer still has to futz with the spacing, decide smallcaps or italic, choose a weight ... and on and on and on ... <br> <br>Even though the font software might be cross-platform, I doubt the licenses allow for twice the installs. Each install counts as an install. I personally don't think that is one of the greatest features. It doesn't benefit me, as I don't use PC computers. (Not that there is anything wrong with PC computers). <br> <br>Another thing about accents ... Accents are part of the cultures of other languages, aren't they? It would be boring and sad and safe and bland to castrate those languages which depend upon accents and make them conform to a so-called preferred (more bland) looking page. <br> <br>I wish I did speak another language. (I only speak enough Italian to get myself into trouble.) If I did speak another language it would be to embrace the differences, not to find the similarities.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany <br> <br><i>Another thing about accents ... Accents are part of the cultures of other languages, aren't they?</i> <br> <br>I am extremely sensitive to accents. That is why I am not arrogant. I was teasing. Most fonts do not have well made accents. When they do, it is often for "one language only". You must live, read and speak the language of a country to determine what is right for the language. You must know the people, their history. <br> <br>Not to mention that some countries have their own political aspects about language, such as the Estonians. History has been unkind to languages, book burnings and keyboards forced upon them.

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, I'm glad you were teasing. It kinda took me by surprise. <br> <br>I understand your points, and I do agree with there being "no global 'one size fits all'." I don't hope that all type becomes open type, but, I'm happy with the type that has become OT. <br> <br>Admittedly, I know very little about the engine. I shop by exterior shape and color.

<div class=commentbody>Gerald: <br> <br>Yes, font format specs are incomprehensible to normal humans. This is unfortunate, but does not doom the font formats. The part you are quoting is a part of the OpenType spec that is also part of the older TrueType spec. This density of programmer-speak did not stop TrueType from being successful. The Type 1 spec is only a little better, not much. Have you tried reading it? <br> <br>> Also I get sick of hearing how you simply insert tab "a" into hole "b" and voila! <br> <br>Sometimes that's how it works, at the normal-person level of explanation. If you want to understand it at the programming level you will have to put some real time and effort into understanding the underlying technologies. Maybe start by attending some of the workshops and seminars that keep on happening at ATypI and other venues. <br> <br>> By the way can you send me a sample of Adobe's Finnish version of accents? That would put my mind to rest. <br> <br>Why? The question of whether anyone will bother to do such culturally-sensitive work is quite independent from what is or is not enabled by the technology. <br> <br>The main case like this I can point to at Adobe is that all of our Cyrillic fonts have italics where three or four characters have quite different alternate forms for Serbian than for other Cyrillic languages. The fonts use the locale feature to specify these alternates. <br> <br>I believe that Adam Twardoch has used the locale feature to create various language-specific accent forms in some fonts he's worked on. But you should ask him on that score. <br> <br>As for optical size, there's no question that the multiple master solution was the best one going in digital typesetting. It's a shame that OpenType's 'size' feature is not nearly as versatile, and requires separate fonts. You won't get any argument from me that OpenType has the best solution in this area. I will say that it's better than nothing, and that Adobe's type group continues to care about optical size scaling. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> So here we have this culturally sensitive engineering crusade claiming the linguistically abused can preserve their own type nuances. The same crusaders dismiss the Finnish language as trivia. <br> <br>Baloney. I never dismissed any language as trivia. Adobe has not yet done language-specific accent variants, but that does not mean it will not do so in the future. <br> <br>I wasn't giving you heck for quoting TrueType, merely making the point that <i>all</i> font format specs are pretty impenetrable, so using the impenetrability of one of them as an argument against that format <i>in particular and compared to others</i> is pretty much indefensible. <br> <br>> To forbid linguistic cultures to alter then refuse to supply them with their needs is clearly, a take it or leave it mentality. Not culturally enlightened, sorry. It is just as hideous as book burning. <br> <br>Here you're speaking of licensing issues. Adobe is one of the few foundries that has long historically allowed modifications of its fonts. However, it's true that the current EULA does not explicitly permit the kinds of modifications that you want folks to be able to do. I have made a proposal internally to change the EULA in this regard, but I don't know when or if that will occur. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas, a question on Optical scaling. If I remember rightly, John Hudson mentioned that in principle Open Type has the capacity of coding in such as way that InDesign would automatically choose a different size-sensitive design, depending on the point size you chose. Is it correct that such a linking can be done? Has it been done or are there plans to do it? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas, <br> <br>Good morning from Finland. <br> <br>You said <i>I never dismissed any language as trivia. Adobe has not yet done language-specific accent variants, but that does not mean it will not do so in the future.</i> <br> <br>Well, it is a problem, that and licensing. To be honest I have not adjusted <i>Finnish accents.</i> I don't know what to do with them. There is not much you can do with two dots other than make them smaller, or bigger, or move them up down, over, closer or wider between. Those small adjustments make a big difference. <br> <br>Had the Finnish artisans completed, or where not over ridden by foreign influences their alphabet was taking a life of it very own. The second <i>upper case A</i> was not defined by two dots, (I hate to use the right name, you understand) <i>but became an upright Italic lowercase a.</i> That was the direction their alphabet was taking. The <i>uppercase</i> was early traditional classical <i>roman,</i> very remarkable work by the way. <i>"Pre-printing"</i> in structure. There was no lowercase. However, strangely there was a complete upright italic, <i>"printing in structure"</i> Aldine in considerations. <br> <br>But let me back up a bit. The G, was no more than a C with a very kerned "small cap (i) " next to it. I don't know Finnish, what I do know is they have trouble with the G's in my name. <br> <br>How did the original model for the alphabet find its' way to Finland? I am not speaking of the transition, I am speaking of the original forms, which are intact. Some thoughts are promoted for instant consideration. Sailing, the Finns are swarthy seamen for sure. Foreign occupation. And others. What others? The Church, sleigh, skiis, skates. Not an easy exercise because remember, the <i>roman</i> without the <i>lowercase,</i> the <i>italic fully developed.</i> That indicates separate influences. <br> <br>The <i>roman with no lowercase</i> indicates very early, as does the upright Aldine Italic, but later. <i>(I use Aldine to describe.)</i> Dutch Foundry Italics leaned towards a sloping italic, which sailed its way to influence the English, hence the very sloping Caslon italic. <br> <br>The italic I speak of is not of Dutch influence. <br> <br><b>Transitional Influence</b> <br> <br>What is the influence for the Finnish <i>"transitional introductions to the alphabet?"</i> Dare I suggest, the <i>"Finnish mother tongue".</i> <br> <br>I was very honoured to have found the Ramsay Stones. For me it was like walking through a language, alphabet cathedral. The stones covered a period of time, illustrating within walking distance, an orderly sequence of transitional development. All dated. <br> <br>Also if you have any thoughts these works were work of inferior hands you would be delighted to see how wrong you would be. Especially one them. The work is exemplary. <br> <br>This is truly a transitional phase I am speaking of, independent of any I have seen elsewhere. Furthermore, it would have better suited the Finnish language. <br> <br>This is why I seem so fanatical about languages maintaining independence <br> <br>The French find sacred things in their spoken language, they find merit in Garamond. Quebec has language police. Jail time for abusers. <br> <br>I see nothing wrong with that. <br> <br>So for me, I would rather go back and pick up where the Finnish artisans left off. Since only an <i>uppercase roman</i> exists, but they were introducing <i>italic lowercase</i> forms for variable sounds, the same approach would probably have resulted in reverse when they got around to a lowercase roman. That is my guess, or where I would have taken it. <br> <br>Rather than bump dots around. But that is just me. <br> <br>In any event, had I viewed the Ramsay Stones first, Bodoni 26 would have looked much different. <br> <br><a href=http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html target=_blank>http://lanstontype.com/Bodoni26.html</a> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> "Optical Scaling" out trumps musical ligatures. <br> <br>But Gerald, after all these years, why do none of your fonts have optical scaling? <br> <br>BTW, I think optical scaling is indeed more important than ligatures, but it's less important than multilingual support (which OpenType is great at).

<div class=commentbody>Type 3 also isn't supported in OpenType, nor is it supported in any common WYSIWYG form (it never worked with ATM, and Display PostScript is hardly widespread). <br> <br>It apparently was possible to do things akin to hinting in Type 3, as long as you created the infrastructure from scratch. That is, Type 3 doesn't have any intrinsic understanding of hinting the way Type 1 does. <br> <br>In any case, I think the chances of Type 3 making a comeback, rounded to the nearest whole number as a percentage, are zero. <br> <br>* * * * <br> <br>As for the question of national preferences in accent structure, I think what is lacking is a single central listing of what the various national preferences are. For instance, I know that Polish favors very steep acute accents on the lowercase, because there are no grave accents in Polish. But if I were to recommend doing language-specific variant accents, I'd want to do them across the board for a bunch of languages, not just Polish. <br> <br>If we do try to catalog this info, I suggest a different thread. Or maybe even using the ATypI mailing list, which has a stronger international readership. <br> <br>* * * * <br> <br>William and Gerald: Yes, OpenType as a format already has scaled optical sizes with the ability to handle them as well as lead type. This isn't as elegant as what was possible with MMs, but is still something. All of Adobe's fonts that have optical size variants have been set up with this feature. <br> <br>However, almost every OpenType layout feature is dependent on support from elsewhere. In the case of optical size, no application has chosen to support the feature as yet. InDesign does support automatic use of the optical size axis in MM fonts, but does not yet make use of the OpenType layout feature for optical size. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, this was probably before Type 1 was an open format. Or in situations where people wanted to do something odd that was not supported in regular hinting in Type 1 (like use hints for optical size scaling?). <br> <br>Making MM fonts now, as an end-user consumable, is a bad idea because they clearly have a very limited shelf life. Adobe has stopped selling MM fonts, and we expect to make an announcement fairly soon about how long we intend to continue supporting them for in our products. Non-MM Type 1 support will doubtless continue for years after Adobe stops selling them. MMs are not going to be so lucky. <br> <br>Of course, Adobe alone wouldn't be your sole determining factor. But I wouldn't want to place any bets on MMs still being supported in future Mac and Windows operating systems 3-5 years from now. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> they clearly have a very limited shelf life. <br> <br>But InDesign support by itself is a big deal, because people who are sensitive enough to typography are good targets for both InDesign and MM. And wasn't InDesign released <i>after</i> MM was demoted? <br> <br>BTW, is it true that the PDF font-matching technique (like in Adobe Serif and Sans) relies on MM technology? Doesn't this mean de facto support for MM will take a while to abate? <br> <br>Anyway, to me even just 3 years is a long time. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Basically the feature had already been implemented before the decision was made not to do more MM development. <br> <br>It's true that there are several bits of technology that use MM internally, such as Acrobat's font fauxing. But that isn't the same as support for end-user MM fonts. <br> <br>Multiple master technology, or something much like it, is still a wonderful development tool, and has other uses in "private" ways that are internal to an application such as Acrobat. But those uses are separate from general system-level support in the OS. <br> <br>It's up to you if you want to keep on making MM fonts. I'm not making any commitments on a minimum time for future support, just being very clear that those days are definitely numbered. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Two things. <br> <br>[1] As for the question of national preferences in accent structure, I think what is lacking is a single central listing of what the various national preferences are. <br> <br>As a hopeful type designer, I would find this immensly useful, as I intend for my typefaces to be as inclusive as possible. Anybody know anything much about this? <br> <br>[2] Can somebody remind me why making MM fonts now (I mean for a third-party) is a bad idea? <br> <br>I have only just started playing around with MM, but from what I have experienced with the format and in regards to it's future potential I think it is a bit of magic for type design. If Adobe drops it, will FontLab & Co still implement the option to design using MM technology? Generating instances is a Godsend. <br> <br>kris.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thomas <br> <br><i>Non-MM Type 1 support will doubtless continue for years after Adobe stops selling them. MMs are not going to be so lucky.</i> <br> <br>I just want to clarify what is meant about the support you refer to for MM fonts. <br>Does that mean that the font will not be recognized by InDesign or Illustrator or just the feature of of optical scaling will not be recognized. <br>Since I have all the MM fonts from Adobe and use them daily without using the optical scaling feature I am a little concerned about the support. you refer to. <br> <br>Thanks for your reply, <br>gln</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I began using type, I started with MM. It's wonderful how you can work with optical scaling. <br> <br>I cannot understand why that technology has been given up. Optical scaling on OT, even the Adobe Opticals aren't nearly as fine. <br> <br>I would wish very much, to have a technology that makes it able to use fonts that have their own optical specifics over 6 or 8 sizes (or more) like in ancient lead-type, combined with the ease of working with a computer and for example InDesign, that does it automatically. <br> <br>So a good quality of type could return. <br> <br>With MM that was possible (a good worked font provided of course). Some (or most?) optical axes had non-linear scaling measures, and so a very fine adjusting to optical issues was possible. <br> <br>The few "opticals" of OT-Fonts are far away of that skill. <br> <br>I would wish that these possibilities would come back. With MM or OT or something. <br> <br>Michael</div>

<div class=commentbody>William and Gerald: Yes, OpenType as a format already has scaled optical sizes with the ability to handle them as well as lead type. This isn't as elegant as what was possible with MMs, but is still something. All of Adobe's fonts that have optical size variants have been set up with this feature. <br> <br>However, almost every OpenType layout feature is dependent on support from elsewhere. In the case of optical size, no application has chosen to support the feature as yet. InDesign does support automatic use of the optical size axis in MM fonts, but does not yet make use of the OpenType layout feature for optical size. <br> <br>So how do we read this? <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>MM as a font development tool is a big part of our work flow. I'm holding on to Illustrator 10 since the new CS does not contain any MM controls. So I hope so long as AI10 works, I'll have MMs. <br> <br>That said, I can understand their demise. Most art directors and designers I have worked with have no idea what a MM font is. When I have brought a new design to them in MM format so they can get a better idea on the range of weight that are possible, they are, what's that English idiom, Gobsmacked.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do recommend following the link back to the original discussion, since my full post (Oct 8 2003) also discussed the compatibility/information issue, which I think was also significant. <br> <br>Gerald: <br> <br>The optical size feature is explained clearly in Adobe's FDK documentation, and supported by the FDK (which is a no-cost download from Adobe.com). I am not 100% certain, but I don't think it is supported by FontLab at this time, so it might be a good feature request for them. Don't know about FontMaster. <br> <br>I don't know that we've bothered covering this in any of our workshops, since it is really very simple compared to a lot of aspects of OpenType, it's something that only a minority of font developers are interested in, and the details are mostly specific to our FDK tool, which few people are using since FontLab is a much more integrated environment. <br> <br>As for support for the feature in InDesign, I am of course generally not allowed to comment on features for future versions of Adobe applications. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

You must be much more of an optimist than I am. Why the surge of interest now when there have been good technologies for it for over a decade? <br> <br>Then again, I agree with you that AAT, as a fundamentally Mac-only technology, is not very interesting.
