body: "I am working on a script font where several letters have 2 versions: one swashed
  (main) and one plain (alternate). When the same letter comes twice in a row I want
  to switch one of them around - to avoid colliding swashes.\r\n\r\nI mainly use the
  calt feature like this: sub l l' by l.calt;\r\nThis works as expected, and if I
  keep repeating the letter the two versions alternate all the way.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes
  I want to switch the first letter: sub g' g by g.calt;\r\nWhen I now keep repeating
  the letter I just get a long row of the switched glyph with the original glyph at
  the end - no continous alternation. How do I write the code to avoid this?\r\n\r\nFor
  simple letter pairs this is just a minor niggle (I really don't expect text to be
  set with many identical letters in a row), but as I want to group/class similar
  letters to also avoid collisions between different letters, I need to get this sorted.\r\n\r\nI
  would really appreciate some input from someone with a better grasp on OpenType
  feature programming than myself ;)"

  body: "Thanks for your input! :)\r\n\r\nYour first block: well, this was never a
    problem - it worked with a simple \"sub l l' by l.calt;\". They way you suggest
    it it looks like only three-letter repeats will be changed, and not double-letters...?
    I haven't tried it out, though - as I already had a working solution.\r\n\r\nYour
    second block: will not the first sub change every single-letter occurrence of
    the letter to the alternate form, too? Wouldn't want that...\r\n\r\nAfter some
    experimentation I have almost sussed it - using lookups! :)\r\nThis is very close
    to working:\r\n\r\nlookup calt1 {\r\n   sub g' g by g.calt;\r\n} calt1 ;\r\nlookup
    calt2 {\r\n   sub g.calt g.calt' by g;\r\n} calt2 ;\r\n\r\nOnly caveat is that
    with odd repeats of letters the last two in the sequence will be the colliding
    main forms. Hmm... My head hurts from trying to find a perfect solution to this...

    just as I want it to when the second letter in a pair should be switched. Easy.
    ;)\r\n\r\nThe problem is when I want to sub the first letter in a pair (because
    the combination alt/main looks better that way).\r\nFor repeated letters the perfect
    solution would be code that generates the result:\r\ng.calt g g.calt g .... when
    there are even repetitions, and\r\ng g.calt g g.calt g ... when there are odd
    repetitions\r\nBut that would probably take some sort of backwards changing in

  body: "The basic letters have looped ascenders/descenders. When there are two consecutive
    loops (overlapping) I want to switch one letter to a straight form \"piercing\"
    the (other) loop. So for the ascenders the loop goes to the right, and the right
    letter has to switch. Easy. But the descenders are looped to the left, so the
    left letter has to switch. Which looks to be difficult to program for alternate
    substitution for multiple loops. Bummer.\r\nI think I have to compromise a bit...
    Perhaps it is possible to program it (for odd numbers of loops) so that I get
    the sequence \"g.calt g g.calt g ... g.calt g g.calt g.calt g\"? So ending the
    sequence with two consecutive straighs and one final loop? Can that be done?"
