  body: Russ, Benmont is quirky and I love it. I know that doesn't sound like a serious,
    bona fide crit, but that's how I feel!

    those caps are very cute."

  body: "My reaction is the opposite of Alex's. The lowercase is nifty but the caps
    aren't quite there.\r\n\r\nI think both W and w might be better off without the
    trailing stroke."

    you might change?\r\n\r\nCerulean, what could make the caps look better?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Just some things that look out of character. I would definitely:\r\nRound
    the top left _or_ square the bottom left of the C.\r\nGive the D a top-left stem
    (as on B, P, R).\r\nRemove the upturn from the bottom right of the E.\r\nRethink
    the G completely.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the general squareness seems harsher on
    the tall capitals than on the lowercase, but as I flip back and forth between
    them it occurs to me that we can't really judge how well they go together without
    seeing them set together.\r\n"
