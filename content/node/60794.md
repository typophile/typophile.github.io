  body: "Yes, I would say that is the right category, but there is no match I could
    find at Dafont, and none I could locate at MyFonts. This pushes me towards the
    idea that this is an amateur font that is perhaps a custom font made by the 'artist'
    who did the lettering. \r\n\r\nIn case you cannot find the original font, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/|Klang]]
    is pretty similar, and could be backslanted a bit to make it more vertical.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "If you want some choices that are even less formal than Klang, Robert Schenk
    of Ingrimayne Type has some hand-lettered pen fonts (at MyFonts): Gretchen Hello,
    Xahosch, Xaltid, Balboat and Hermainita. The last one is perhaps the neatest lettering,
    and most professional looking. The others are less formal.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "wow thank you soo much i really spend a long time yesterday searching.\r\ni
    found \"klang\" as well but i think its a bit to dynamic, if you know what i mean,
    it looks a bit italic to me.\r\ni like \"federhozen\" and \"post antiqua\" is
    quite nice as well.\r\n\r\ni will try \"balboat\" is nice as far as i can see.\r\nthank
    you soo much for you feedback!\r\n"
