  kerning Helvetica. And can you point out the shortcomings in terms of kerning in
  \ the piece below and suggest any improvements. It looks alright to me but you guys
  are better at this. I really want some help with kerning lowercase \"r\" and \"t\".\r\n\r\nThanks,
  I really appreciate the help."
