  I'd like to know what are the best bookstores in town where I can find books on
  Typography, graphic design, essay ... even about contemporary art.\r\n\r\nIf you
  could give me the location as well it will be perfect.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."

    including Zwemmers, Foyles and numerous second hand bookshops.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."

    either on Charing Cross Road or inside the serpentine gallery.\r\n\r\nI also found
    the bookstore inside [[http://www.tate.org.uk/|Tate Modern]] quite good."

  body: The best store for old (i.e., used and rare) typography and type books is
    without a doubt Collinge & Clark. You can find its address via google; it is a
    brief walk from Russell Square.

  body: "Thank you for all your fast replies.\r\nActually I've already been at Magma
    which I found good but their books and magazines can all be easily find in Paris.\r\nI
    was looking for \"more specific UK\" essays or books that you can hardly find
    in France. Therefore, I think I'll go to Colling & Clark, and other second-hand
    bookstores you told me about."

    No. 1 - No. 10.\r\nVery hidden inside a hidden art gallery. The google map link
    shows exactly where it is. "
