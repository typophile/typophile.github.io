  she would go about typing an X Bar. I've attached an image of the character. I've
  done some digging around online and found the character mentioned on [[http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D|this
  page]] (third character from the bottom).\r\n\r\nI see that Lucida Sans Unicode
  has it as a character, and I can copy and paste the X bar from that page into Word
  when using that font. I've checked the Character Map in Windows and couldn't find
  it, so I'm curious though how I would go about typing this on a PC. Is there a key
  combination using the Alt key + a series of numbers?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help.\r\nDavid"

  body: I don't think that the x-bar (or any other letter-bar) is included in a standard
    font set. Normally, the typesetting program will add the bar itself by writing
    the letter and then drawing the line over the top. If you want a symbol like this
    in Word, you should be able to use the Microsoft Equation plugin (something like
    Insert > Object > Microsoft Equation x.x). You can use the dialog that appears
    to create the x-bar (and a whole equation that includes it). If you're looking
    to use mathematics symbols seriously, consider the LaTeX typesetting system.

    should apply to regular programs as well, I'm not entirely clear on unicode support
    in non-web contexts, but it appears to work in most. For example copy and paste
    the x here. It should work in most apps.\r\n\r\nBTW. Character map doesn't show
    it because this is actually one regular character and then a special modifier
    TO the character. The x here may not be correct, but the modifier should be."

  body: For typesetting formulas in academia the usual tool is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX|TeX]].
    TeX editors are available as free software for most operating systems. The TeX
    system will create any symbol used in mathematics and statistics.

  body: "As an alternative to Word's equation editor,[[http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/Overbar.htm|
    this]] page explains how to construct an overstrike character and assign a shortcut
    key.\r\n\r\nBut for doing statistics or other math, wouldn't a math pi font be
    a better solution in the long run? The American Mathematical Society has free
    Postscript distributions of Computer Modern and AMSFonts at [[http://www.ams.org/tex/type1-fonts.html]].
    TrueType versions are on the Mozilla website at [[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts/]].\r\nWolfram's

  body: "Gus\r\n\r\nBut is there an x bar character in those AMS fonts? I haven't
    set maths for a long time, but I recall that the x bar was created by an overline
    on the x, not a specific character."

  body: "> But is there an x bar character in those AMS fonts?\r\n\r\nYou're probably
    right. I, too, don't work with scientific material any more and don't have any
    math fonts installed, but I did have a vague memory of using a font that had an
    x-bar, and those fonts are the usual suspects. Of course, given that this is Monday,
    I might be thinking of h-bar."
