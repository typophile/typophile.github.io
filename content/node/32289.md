    and see how they were put together. It's not black and white (the classic) but
    here's one I did a while back in Illustrator:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/illustartor-op-art-3_6700.jpg]"

  body: As for your example, Martin, I would start off with concentric circles & just
    add filter after filter untill you've achieved the result you want. Twist it,
    use the free transform tool to nudgde it a little, maybe bloat the whole thing
    up a little... Play around & you could come across some very surprising and nice
    results.

    - then distort etc. Move to PhotoShop for even move fun - layer them - use Liquify
    filter etc. '
