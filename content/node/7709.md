  body: Hey, Don Paul&#42; looks pretty good! Good use of gray to bend the bodies.
    The only problem &#40;which makes me suspect you&#39;re working on MacOS&#41;
    is that in some places the blur is too strong, like your diagonals, the bar of
    the &#34;A&#34;, etc. This problem is more severe in the light weight of Renex,
    especially where you&#39;re filling counters with adjacent light grays &#40;like
    in the &#34;o&#34;&#41;.&#42;&#42; The bolder Renex is much better - which is
    normal - the compromises vary depending on weight, and furthermore are easier
    to swallow above 1-pixel stems. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, not &#34;Don Paulo&#34;? <BR>
    <BR>&#42;&#42; Avoid abutting two pixels lighter than ~160. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I love these faces, and I think that Don Paul is a great tribute. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    curious about the relationship of the two fonts, as Renex appears to not be a
    geometric face.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Keep up the good work! <BR> <BR>aaron

  body: Luciano, <BR> <BR>Don Paul is an attractive face, especially the lowercase.
    <BR> <BR>Admittedly, I don&#39;t have much typographic education, so many typefaces
    referenced on these boards are matters of research for me. <BR> <BR>That said,
    while I really like your v and w, and the way you&#39;ve given them points at
    the baseline, they suprise me in that they don&#39;t follow the geometries established
    by the a, b, d, m, n, p, q, and y. <BR> <BR>Is this a direct result of one of
    Paul Renner&#39;s designs? <BR> <BR>I also really like the i and j and the way
    they seem to enhance the set while departing significantly from the motiffs of
    the majority of the other characters. <BR> <BR>Also, can you describe to me the
    significance, or tradition perhaps, of designing a very conservative uc, and then
    a lc that is so playful?
