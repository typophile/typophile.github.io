  time to read my post and I am humbled before your expertise on typography. I would
  like to know what fonts are suitable for a name logo for website and business card.
  I like \"skinny fonts,\" I don't know the proper family name for them. Ideally,
  I'd like them remain the same. Do you have any suggestions for a logo? My name \"ronald
  NZ tan\" is in Helveltica Neue 33 Extended and Optima nova was used in \"PHOTOGRAPHER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  am novice when it comes to typography; however, I did my initial homework and I
  read on the internet that the suggested usage of fonts is a mix and match. Helvetica
  Neue is a sans serif and to make great design, it was suggested that I use a serif
  font in addition to the sans-serif.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy previous branding logo was, ITC
  Bauhaus Light and my name appears in all lowercase, \"ronald n. tan.\""

  body: "Well, mixing and matching is about more than serif or sans-serif. Think about
    it like clothing - When you dress you want to create a balance between items of
    clothing that are similar and those that are very contrasted. The worst you can
    do is dress in, say, pink and red together - because they're almost close enough
    to match, yet not far enough apart to provide nice contrast.\r\n\r\nWhen pairing
    typefaces like this - if you even want to do that, one typeface is often enough
    - you want to think of each aspect of the types and see if they either move in
    the same direction/match or in very opposite directions/contrast nicely. The problem
    with Helvetica and Optima is that they're sort of moving in just slightly different
    directions: both are sans serifs with an idea of cleanness, yet they do it sufficiently
    differently to jar (like pink and red), at least to my eye."

    Why are \"N\" and \"Z\" spaced so tightly? "

    parlance), is because it was suggested to me by a retoucher. I know she's isn't
    an expert on text like you folks are.\r\n\r\nI'll modify and post an update.\r\n\r\nThank
    you both for your time to comment."

  body: Logos are not BASIC typography. Far from. And designers are starving from
    time to time too - they might just understand where you're coming from and be
    able to offer you a good deal. You're free to drop me a mail if you're interested.

    to be a starving photographer, too.\r\n\r\nLogos are not basic by any stretch
    of the imagination; it's not something you can learn in a weekend any more than
    you can master studio portrait lighting in a weekend. You might be able to make
    the strobes work properly, but as you know, it takes years to actually get beautiful
    results. And like great photography, a great logo looks effortless and natural,
    but these results are the product of serious study and practice and not just an
    eye for the beautiful. "

  body: "Ronald, I've been in your situation many times. A great solution for you
    would be a trade of services. The barter system is far too underrated these days
    but it's a great way for the arts in general to cross-pollinate.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    when I was in school a graphic designer came to talk to one of my classes on several
    occasions. He said he was able to get a great long-term contract with a busy downtown
    restaurant by initially offering to trade services. It was a win-win for both
    of them-- he gave them great advertising and design solutions that brought more
    business to the restaurant; he got a long-term contract and free catering for
    his wedding.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, what Frank and others have suggested may be your
    best bet. Get a designer to craft you a logo that will do the most for you. It's
    good that you are learning about typography and design and you should continue
    to do so. But for now utilize the skills of an expert in the field!"
