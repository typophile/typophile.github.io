  try it on WhatTheFont anyway without much luck&#41;. Does anyone recognize it? I

  body: That explains why I haven&#39;t been able to find it. It&#39;s very nice.
    It seems to be a cross between <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/filosofia/">Filosofia</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian/">Bodoni Egyptian</a>,
    with Georgia&#39;s lovely x-height. I&#39;ve always been a sucker for big x-heights.
