  Giants\r\nCincinatti Reds\r\nPhiladelphia Flyers\r\nManchester United\r\n\r\nIt's
  a shame that most major sports teams have no idea who \r\ndesigned their own identities."

  body: "If memory serves me well, sports team logos are hired out by the \"League(s)\"\r\n\r\nI
    think that each major pro organization \"has a guy\" who does logos. They say
    to keep style consistent.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Chris, that might have been the case in the past, but I'm not so sure it
    works the same way these days. \r\n\r\nFor example, I know that <a href=\"http://www.coudal.com/about.php\">Coudal
    Partners</a> in Chicago created the identity (logo, uniforms, etc.) for the <a
    href=\"http://houston.astros.mlb.com\">Houston Astros</a>. However, I don't think
    they are the Official Logo Guys\u2122 of Major League Baseball."

  body: The owners care who makes their logos, its big money. The New York Giants
    (Big Blue) trotted out red jerseys for a game just before Christmas. It was called
    a Retro Jersey. It was all about selling jerseys. Sometimes multiple logos are
    used for sports franchises for the same reason, sales.

    to care :-)
