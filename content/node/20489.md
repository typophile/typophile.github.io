  project left over by another designer.  \r\n\r\ni'm 99% sure it's not arial, not
  verdana, and not myriad.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThese tiny samples are all I have to work
  with.  Maybe someone with a more discerning eye than my own can pick out which font
  it really is...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/account_6288.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/orderStatus_on_4323.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tutorial_over_6643.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/news_5892.gif]\r\n\r\nI've
  got more tiny samples if it would help at all...."
