  body: "farquart,  if you read the introduction to these fonts on the blog you will
    see it acknowledges that these are early freeware works with reduced character
    sets etc.  I would point out however that some of these were made available at
    the request of a designer who wanted a page to direct her clients to for downloads
    of them.\r\n\r\nAs paragraph says..."
