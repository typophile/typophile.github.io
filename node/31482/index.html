  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am in my 2nd yr of a BA Hons Graphic Design course and was wondering if anyone could give me tips on how to handle the disseratation and what topic taht would be interesting to focus on. It can be based on advertising, branding etc. Anything taht we want. i was thinking of doing advertising and how advertisers target different products at male and female without any regards to gender stereotyping that was an issue in the 1960&rsquo;s and beyond i.e. washing up liquids aimed at women but now, the recent one shown in the UK for Fairy (name of washing up liquid) is the famous chef Ainsley Harriet so therefore, women are not the sole target audience. I have one issue though an taht is for an advertising essay we had to do, i have done it on a product with similar ideas but thsi woulod be in more depth. Do you think that i should leave the idea and choose another because having similar ideas in my portfolio won&rsquo;t do me any good. What do you think? Can you think of anything else?</p>
<p>Option 2) Should i focus on a a particular brand and its branding including all the advertising campaigns etc and compare and contrast how they targeted their audience before and how they do it now? There HAS to be a reference to the present times so what do you think. I need help.</p>

<p>However, I’d recommend that you do your dissertation on a subject that you have views on or interest in, if only to keep it from becoming too much of a chore. I also wouldn&rsquo;t worry about your portfolio, a dissertation counts towards your college work but it really needn’t be in your portfolio mentioning the subject in an application letter might be useful but potential employers are unlikely to ask to see it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>typequake and timd, I think the confusion is that on the eastern side of the pond, there&rsquo;s not a categorical difference betwixt thesis and dissertation.  On the western side, thesis is for Masters, and dissertation is for Doctorate, and generally for Bachelors whilst occasionally called a thesis as well (much to the chagrin of Masters candidates, as BA &ldquo;theses&rdquo; are rarely more than about 20-25, the average term paper for MA students), it&rsquo;s often called an honours research paper or something to that effect.  In HS it&rsquo;s often that or an &ldquo;extended essay&rdquo; as I believe the IBO&rsquo;s terminology is.</p>
<p>One thing that has always interested me that you might be able to work in to, especially if you&rsquo;re a fan of RRT or Stylistics/Narratology is perhaps looking at the effect of typeface on readers in books or advertising.  Take a genre (thriller novels, beauty product adverts) and examine the fount choices.  Back during the <em>vanguardia</em> of Latin America, one of the primary theoretical break-throughs was breaking the quality of the text into three distinct qualities:</p>
<ul><li>Semantic</li><li>Phonetic</li><li><strong>Graphic</strong></li></ul>
That is to say, while traditionally only the semantic quality had been looked at and/or used for the creation of poetry (phonetic was only used inasmuch as the poetic required, e.g., creating rhyme or rhythm), but by focusing in on the phonetic, for instance, they were able to create poems that superficially had little to no semantic meaning (aka "gibberish") but had a phonetic quality that was beyond anything formerly written.  The graphic quality gave birth to the concrete poetry that Latin America is so well known for, but it extends beyond the simple arrangement of the words.  (An author that mastered and used all three together is Vicente Huidobro.) For example, in a paper I was writing on electronic poetry, a genre which many established critics are still unsure of, I used Ibarra as my fount, because it was based on old Iberian printing presses.  Subconsciously, the readers of my paper, most of whom would be specialising in far older poetry, say, Garcilasso de la Vega, or Góngora, would instantly relate the older "true" poetry with the electronic poetry on which I was writing.  
<p>Applying it to modern day advertising or book/pamphlet design could really give you a lot to talk about, and you&rsquo;d be able to easily fill up 6k words in analyses.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Apologies in advance. This will not be a very constructive post. It boggles my mind that as a second year student, you feel the need to ask typophilers to help with a focus for your dissertation.</p>
<p>In my area of studies (creative writing) you are expected, by 2nd year, to be able to come up with a thesis and direction for your papers on your own. If nothing else, your studies are supposed to teach you to think critically for yourself, not simply execute a paper based on other people&rsquo;s ideas. The hard part is <em>always</em> struggling with the direction and focus and logic of what you want to say. You may get through your degree by asking others to feed you the ideas, your teacher might even not have a problem with you doing so, but this practice will not serve you well in the long run.</p>
<p>Sit down, work out a connection or concept or argument you want to make, draw up an outline for your paper, write a thesis statement, and post <em>that</em>. You&rsquo;ll get better feedback and you&rsquo;ll be able to say you did the thinking on your own.</p>
