    asked my sister about that and she said: do we see custom type with every book/novel
    that we read?  "

  body: I'm sure I've seen this font before, but I just can't place it. I can almost
    picture what the website looked like, but it's hard to say. There are so many
    small foundries, it's very difficult to keep track of them all. (Watch, it'll
    turn out to be from Linotype or something.)
