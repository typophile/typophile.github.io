  cards (for new people) in the same style / font the firm's been using for a while.
  No one knows which fonts were in use -- the only thing I have to go off of it saved
  JPEGs of old business cards.\r\n\r\nI've identified one of the fonts in use (Abadi
  MT Condensed Light), but I can't figure out the Name font. It's similar to Impact
  (but the \"R\" is straight, unlike the curved Impact \"R\"). It's also similar to
  Hattenschweiler, Swiss 924, and Hadrian Bold.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help? Thank you!"
