  of fonts using FontLab.\r\nI installed all fonts(around 30) to windows. When I open
  any program I just see the Font name and under it only REGULAR AND ITALIC. and no
  other.\r\n\r\nFrom what I see the problem might be that the font is dispayed only
  by the name ex. Accident and NOT Accident Light or Accident Bold. \r\n\r\nThank
  you very much in advance."

  body: "Well now I'm confused... I'm a long time Mac user (LONG time) and approaching
    the font name restrictions on the MS side I felt like an old man using an ATM
    for the first time. I finally thought I had it straight, but the above confuses
    me.\r\n\r\nAfter reading every article, piece, story, yadda, yadda about styles
    and the MS font selector I thought the 4 styles were ALWAYS available. If you
    install a 2 font family (Regular and Italic) faux Bold and Bold Italic appear
    in the font selector.\r\n\r\nAre you shattering my world as I've come to know
    it and telling me that it IS possible to only have Regular and Italic appear in
    the font selector?"

    trust me; I felt the same for a looong while. Reading Adams article as mentioned
    above is really great to understand more however,\r\n\r\nFoundries have different
    approaches on how to name fonts also, with different behaviour as results. Style
    linked, or not etc."

  body: "The theory is very simple: You cannot have two fonts with the same font family
    name and the same settings for \"bold\" and \"italic\" (the FontLab checkboxes.)
    Otherwise just one of these fonts will be available. \r\nSo if you create a font
    family with up to 4 styles, just make sure you use the checkboxes. \r\nFor more
    than 4 styles you need sub-families as described in the article. "

  body: "Just to be clear, I am talking about the MS font selector and otf fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    understand that you can't have more than 4 fonts with the same family name and
    that only one of them can be regular, italic, bold or bold italic. What has been
    throwing me for a loop is that on the Mac side you can have UP TO the 4 styles,
    while on the Microsoft side you HAVE 4 styles (the actual installed fonts plus
    faux styles).\r\n\r\nI say on the \"Microsoft side\" rather than on the \"PC side\"
    because some software publishers (like Adobe) don't use the Microsoft font selector.\r\n\r\nI
    may misunderstand the situation, and if I do, PLEASE set me straight. In apps
    that use the Microsoft font selector (Notepad, Word, etc.) if you install a 2
    font family that uses \"regular\" and \"italic\" as their styles, faux \"bold\"
    and faux \"bold italic\" are still available in the font selector (although there
    is no indication that they are faux styles). If you install a 2 font family that
    consist of Black and Black italic, the font selector shows only \"bold\" and \"bold
    italic\" styles available.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to find any way to get the
    MS font selector to only display \"regular\" and \"italic\" as the available styles...which
    is what dumlovesyou indicated is happening in his situation."
