  OSX users, please be aware that the operating system doesn't support kerning for
  PostScript flavoured OpenType fonts, also not for PostScript fonts. This is only
  for cocoa applications like Freehand, which rely on the operating system to provide
  kerning information instead of taking the information straight from the font. Some
  other applications, like InDesign do support kerning for PostScript Fonts.\"\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIs
  this still true for OS X Snow Leopard? Does this problem affect Pages (iWork)?"

    end, the kerning seems to work just fine. Using Pages '09 (version 4.0.3) on OS

  body: "Thanks, Nina. \r\n\r\nI just tested it myself with Dolly and the kerning
    is fine (same specs as you.) I should hope Pages is sophisticated enough that
    this wouldn't be a problem, and thankfully it isn't. False alarm. But thanks for
    looking into it on your end. \r\n\r\nIt might be the case that Underware's information
    is out of date or simply doesn't apply to Pages. It's interesting because if I'm
    not mistaken Pages is written in Cocoa.   \r\n\r\nBy the way, I just visited your
    website. It's very well done, but aside from that, Patria looks fantastic in Nordlandliebe
    - at least from what I could tell from the photos. "

    the story behind it?\r\n\r\nIt appears the italic would work seamlessly with the
    roman. It's almost upright, standing at attention as if begging for treats."

  body: "That \"g\" is actually a compromise between the conventional form and what
    I consider ideal. Here's an early rough sketch (pardon the ugly ears) of the compromise
    process:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/gs2.gif\r\n\r\nI'm a firm
    believer in the open-bottom binocular \"g\", even though it's difficult to make
    it sober - I wasn't going to compromise on that. I further feel that -ideally-
    in the bottom bowl the top should be thin and the thickest part should on the
    right (the lefthand form). However I conceded that it might make things too \"pushy\",
    and -with the encouragement of Roy Preston, who pointed out the \"g\" in the italic
    of Zapf International- decided to compromise with the conventional form (the righthand
    one); the end-result (the middle form) I'm very happy with.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm actually
    fond of canine analogies in type. One of the parts of Nour&Patria, the Latin subordinate
    of Nour, is code-named Harrier. Quadraat is a bloodhound. And Souvenir is a Golden
    Retriever.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the rest (the closed-bottom binocular form for example is\r\ntopologically highly
    alien - almost like a Chinese logograph),\r\nit needs more help belonging. There's
    little risk of it* becoming\r\ntoo integrated - the rich descender and the ear
    take care of that.\r\n\r\n* I mean the binocular form. The monocular one is hopeless.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    normalizing the stress? (On the other hand, the \xABtraditional contrast\xBB one
    relates to the \"s\", which is why I thought that one might be more \xABharmonious\xBB
    inside the font. Unless you'd change the stress on the \"s\" too I guess.)"

  body: "All this is not a precise science. I have ideas of which characters needs
    help in which ways. This includes considerations of divergence in the x-height
    region versus the extender space (think of the \"s\" versus the bottom of the
    \"g\"), what distracts a reader too much versus just enough, letterwise differentiation,
    and who knows what else. And not least in this complex, nebulous \"equation\"
    is what people expect. People react to the glyphs in a font; maybe not readers
    when faced with a text font, but designers choosing any font are certainly paying
    attention to individual glyphs. And I don't want a designer to say: \xABI'm not
    going to use Patria because of the \"g\".\xBB So I make my \"g\", \"s\" and all
    the others just pushy enough; and I see my job -in part- as helping people in
    spite of themselves.\r\n\r\nThis might seem anti-Design, but to me it's a higher
    level of Design (and maybe anti-Art, because it devalues what <em>I</em> want).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
