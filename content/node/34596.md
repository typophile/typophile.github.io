  1999\r\n\r\nType designer Nick Shinn writes about his design: \"During the early
  part of this century, prior to the ascendancy of sans serifs as the standard bearers
  of the avant garde, the leading edge types were oldstyles. Today, of course, their
  very outrageousness seems quaint, and their once daring construction has become
  too familiar to sustain interest. Yet at the time, typefaces like Goudy's 'Kennerly',
  Benton and Cleland's 'Amsterdam Garamont' and Koch's 'Antiqua' were truly radical.
  For the design of Oneleigh, I took a little inspiration from each of these, mixed
  with some ideas of my own. The main goal was to produce an 'alternate history' 1920s
  typeface, with lots of original letterforms and details, and considerably more roughage
  than the majority of today's PostScript oldstyle revivals, or the slew of bland
  'new' oldstyles. Oneleigh is based on the assumption that, then as now, it is quite
  possible to remain within the bounds of the oldstyle genre, and yet take sufficient
  liberties to create a genuinely different type\".\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
