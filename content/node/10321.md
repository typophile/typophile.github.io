body: It&#39;s possible no one will give a hoot about this, but is anyone else as
  mad as I am about the typography of the Washington Nationals? When I saw the new
  Nationals hats, with it&#39;s loose, playful script &#39;W&#39;, I was intrigued!
  How old fashioned!  <BR> <BR>But then I saw the jerseys

  body: I find the lettering on most sports teams outfits to be pretty cheesy.  I
    think they all hire the same guy.  Maybe he is an old ex-jock with connections.  Given
    that this is a Washington team &#40;read home of design by committee&#41; I am
    not surprised to see a total disconnect from hat to shirt.  Last night they did
    well from hand to glove at least :-&#41;

    <BR>it&#39;s obviously a tribute the the Washington Senators. The hat is about
    the same as the 1969-71 replica shown above. 1971 being the Senators last season
    before relocation to Texas to be the Rangers.

  body: yes, i did take a look at the old uniforms to see what they were all about.
    if you look at the old jerseys, you&#39;ll see that they appropriately use a script
    typeface to spell out &#39;Senators&#39;. Not sure why this wouldn&#39;t have
    worked for &#39;Nationals&#39;.  <BR> <BR>i find sports typography to be fun to
    analyze. there&#39;s nothing like ruining a perfectly good football game by pointing
    out that the new philadelphia eagles uniforms utilize a condensed serif typeface.
    i think it works very well actually. and i bet you it makes them play better.

    out of DC. He lost the battle, but maybe he thinks he can win the war

  body: wishful thinking i&#39;m afraid, dan. the district seems to be overlooking
    the bad letter combination, and focusing solely on the glory of dc baseball. i
    actually have no idea what that is all about, having not grown up in these parts.
    hence my ability to disparage their uniforms
