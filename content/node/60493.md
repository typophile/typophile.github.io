body: "Hi all, this is an identity in progress for a non-profit based here in Houston.
  The basic idea is an organization that exists simply to try to help people have
  a better day and remind them that someone does care. It's started with small gives
  just to put a smile on people's faces (like buying coffee for everyone in the drive-thru
  at Starbucks) and is moving into doing bigger projects for people in need as funds
  permit.\r\n\r\nI've been playing with a variety of ideas for the identity and have
  arrived at these variations of a mark and type, I don't love them but I like the
  direction. I feel like the angled version has the idea of a bit more movement and
  progress associated with it and like the idea of both, but I'm not opposed to going
  an entirely different direction if the idea presents itself. Fire away :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ep_logo_bw_4927.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ep_sketch05_3606.jpg]"

  body: "Agreed Lex, and thanks for the feedback. I'm having a hard time with it coming
    off as too casual if I try to use a more casual typeface, however. You think it's
    the type giving that impression, the mark, or both?\r\n"

    the mark, albeit very clever, tells me more EXIT than encouragement...\r\nI think
    something moving upward too would work better.\r\n"

  body: "It's probably a little bit of both. There are too many angles and sharp bits
    all over the place :-)\r\n\r\nYou don't have to go too casual with it. For a typeface,
    try something like <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/9\" target=\"_blank\">Grover</a>
    from Sudtipos. I'm not saying it has to be a rounded font, but I'd suggest something
    a little quirkier than what you're using. Then, make the mark fit with whatever
    type you're going with.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Try left justifying the type and moving the mark to the left side so that
    it points at the type.\r\n\r\nNow might be a good time to see if some color or
    stylistic techniques might help soften it up a bit. "

  body: "Thanks guys. Cool thoughts on the typeface Lex, I'll take a look at some
    other options. and riccard, I had the same upward thought and had drifted away
    from it early on, I'll revisit that.\r\n\r\nCan't hurt to try to reverse it, good
    thought. We're actually looking at a saturdated slightly reddish orange for the
    brand color, the initial idea was to use it reversed out against that color. I'd
    also like to develop a mark that's distinctive enough to be used on hats, tees,
    etc., without the type."

    lighter and less stern, which is what I think your logo is missing. Stay with

    to figure it out and give up. The random acts of kindness you mentioned and the
    goal of bringing a smile to someone's face, leads me to want to see a more fun,
    maybe even whimsical design.

    I don\u2019t want to confuse anyone or unintentionally misrepresent my example
    as the work of the designer who started this thread.\r\n\r\nI was just trying
    to give a quick example of something a bit more relaxed in style. I agree with
    you that it is difficult to read. It wasn\u2019t my intention for him to copy
    my example, just spark some ideas."

  body: "Hi there... \r\nMaybe stack the \"the\" (3 lines of text) so that the text
    element isn't so long. Other than that, I really like the angled version. Remember
    there will be context to help the concept of the logo. I think it already states
    the 'pay it forward' message. Perhaps the icon can be a color? I dunno... I think
    it's close."
