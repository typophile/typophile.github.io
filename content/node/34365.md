  body: BTW The very best digitisation for the FE-Schrift is [[Fountain]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/ftn_sauerkrauto/">Sauerkrauto</a>.
    I'm not very impressed with the [[Lineto]] version... :^/

  body: BTW These are not "fonts" as you might know them, but alphabets specifically
    designed for the stamping machines that make those plates. So if they have not
    been digitised afterwards -- which is what happened with the FE-Schriften -- they
    don't exist as digital fonts. It's another world entirely.
