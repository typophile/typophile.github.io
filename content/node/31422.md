  body: "Oh,\r\nIt is a logo from a magazine ad, for a carpet company - Endless Knot.
    I suppose I could try to get a copy from the magazine, but sometimes it's easier
    to recreate these things yourself.\r\nCheers."

  body: Ah they probably do, but the company I am doing work for is a carpet store
    that sell these rugs and only has printed material from them, this one actually
    wasn't too bad to recreate anyway.
