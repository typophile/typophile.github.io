body: What&#39;s the best way to include print screens on a magazine/book without
  a low quality vibe? I guess it depends on the printing specs for the book/magazine.  <BR>
  <BR>Take a look at the WEB DESIGN INDEX or any other simmilar book that has a print
  screen site/ interface &#40;I saw a book yesterday with the photoshop interface
  on the cover&#41;.  <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the best way? Hot to transform a 72dpi print
  screen on a good looking printed photo?

    do not change the resolution of a screen capture. You just run it as-is. &#39;Upping&#39;
    the resolution of a screen capture will do nothing but make it look blurry and
    not at all like a screen capture. <BR> <BR>So, simple answer, just leave it as
    is. '

  body: Good point. I guess what I saw was a 640x480 print screen on a &#62;21&#34;
    monitor. This way the photoshop toolbar and top left menu matches the book cover.
    Nice. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: If I understand correctly, you have an image that is 640x480 @ 72 dpi and
    you&#39;d like it to be 300 dpi? <BR> <BR>If you shrink it down to about 2.5 inches
    it will interpolate up to 300dpi...

    300dpi...&#34; <BR> <BR>It won&#39;t interpolate at all. It will just print smaller.
    <BR> <BR>If the screen shot is only 640 pixels wide, that&#39;s all you have to
    work with. If you print it at 1&#34;, it will technically be 640 PPI. If you print
    it at  4&#34; in width, it will be 160 PPI. <BR> <BR>Now, if you tell Photoshop
    to print it at 4&#34;, but at 300 DPI, that&#39;s when it WILL interpolate and,
    most likely, just give you a blurry, muddy image.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d prefer crisp,
    albeit larger pixels when showing screen shots in print.'

  body: 'If you&#39;re going to resize a pixellated image and retain the clarity,
    you need to resample using the Nearest Neighbour setting in Photoshop &#40;as
    opposed to any of the different flavours of Bicubic&#41;, and you need to stick
    to values which are factors of both the horizontal and vertical dimensions &#40;ie
    you can resize a 640 x 480 image to 320 x 240, but not 330 x whatever&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>The other part of making screen graphics look good is the way you separate
    them to CMYK. <BR> <BR>When you convert an image from RGB &#40;or L&#42;a&#42;b,
    for that matter&#41; to CMYK, a black channel has to be generated. &#40;We need
    a black channel in the first place because cyan ink reflects a lot of red light,
    so black generated from only C, M and Y looks muddy-brown.&#41; <BR> <BR>Basically,
    the separating algorithm creates black where R, G and B are equal &#40;or nearly
    equal&#41;. It then removes some of the CMY inks from those areas to avoid over-inking.
    The amount of CMY it removes can be controlled using Photoshop&#39;s Black Generation
    setting in the Custom CMYK set-up. <BR> <BR>When you separate an image with very
    definite areas of black -- a screen-grab is an ideal example -- you want to use
    Maximum Black Generation. This replaces all R=G=B areas with black and removes
    all CMY from those areas, and it aggressively replaces near-neutral mixes with
    black also. <BR> <BR>Result: you get nice clear black lines instead of slightly
    off-register CMYK mixes, and everything &#40;text particularly&#41; looks crisp
    and clear. <BR> <BR>&#40;As an aside, when you separate images with very continuous
    tone -- like photographs -- you use a much, much lighter black generation. Printers
    call it &#39;Skeleton Black&#39;. This preserves subtle tonal shifts and bright
    colour mixes and is more colour-controllable on press&#41;. <BR> <BR>HTH <BR>
