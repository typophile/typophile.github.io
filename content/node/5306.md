    transferring <BR>to the new Teatro degli Arcimboldi, <BR><a href="http://www.teatroallascala.org/eng/arcimboldi/index.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.teatroallascala.org/eng/arcimboldi/index.htm</a> <BR>The
    3D typography &#40;&#34;Teatro degli Arcimboldi&#34;&#41; out of the <BR>building
    is designed &#40;I think&#41; with Bruce Rogers&#39; Centaur. <BR> <BR>&#62; How
    do you cellebrate there? <BR>A friend from Poland, Dorota, sent me a DVD, <BR>&#34;Czesc

    <BR>I have seen it in Polish, with English subtitles, <BR>I have seen it at my
    sister`s, while my sister <BR>and her family took a walk somewhere on the hills.
    <BR>I was fussing, that movie it is romantic but hopeless, <BR>it is one of the
    best film I have ever seen. <BR>I had my birthday cake with all my family, <BR>a
    cake with strawberries and slices of banana, <BR>it was really good. <BR> <BR>Today,
    in the afternoon, I took the bike and went downtown, <BR>just to buy my favorite
    tobacco, &#34;Van Nelle.&#34; <BR>There, one the way back, I met my good friend
    Alberto, <BR>and it was really nice to talk with him. <BR>We planned a bike trip
    &#40;we both ride racing bikes, <BR>but this year, nor me or him had the time
    to train&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here is my grazie, set in Ernesto Hemingway, <BR>the typeface
    family I designed for my MA thesis. <BR> <BR>AS <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/38879.gif"

  body: Festeggiato! I am glad you enjoyed your day.  May you have many more.  My  daughter
    just had her 20th birthday last week.  We allso watched a DVD &#40;My Big Fat
    Greek Wedding&#41;. It was far less sad and reminded me of my silly upbringing.
    <BR> <BR>I envy you being able to visit La Scala when you wish.  I am an opera
    fanatic. I am studying the role of Giorgio in Bellini&#39;s &#34;I Puritani&#34;.  My
    wife gave me singing lessons as a birthday present 2 years ago.  I am just starting
    to sing at an age when most people retire from it. <BR> <BR>Your &#34;Ernesto
    Hemingway&#34; is quite free and alive.  You should do many more types. <BR> <BR>Cia

    <BR>Buon compleanno anche a lei. <BR> <BR>&#62; I envy you being able to visit

    <BR>Have you been? You would love a trip in Vienna. <BR> <BR>&#62; Your &#34;Ernesto
