    body: "Before you all pull on your hooded robes, I should say that I did read
      all the documentation on the Yale site, and then compared his alphabet with
      that of Monotype Bembo, and to my eye it's entirely too close to that Bembo.
      My heterodox opinion is that Carter could have gone much further. (And where
      are the bold and bold italic? Only a \"street\" version, somewhat but not quite
      fully bolder, appears on the website.) His differences are fascinating, of course--slight
      overall condensing, adjusted x-height, and above all, a smoothing away of many
      of the most charming kinks--e.g., on the capital K--instead of adding *more*
      kinks as, say, Dupr\xE9 might have done with the same assignment. But these
      differences don't add up to anything fresh, transcending the source material,
      as Galliard did. Yale is certainly entitled to their own more \"formal\" Bembo,
      but if it went on the market, I would see no point to getting it. I speak as
      a type consumer, not a type designer."

  body: "> Carter could have gone much further.\r\nfrom hrant: I agree, but not further
    from Bembo, because that\u2019s not the point anyway.\r\n\r\nBut that's exactly
    the point. The first poster asked whether Carter's Yale fonts were available to
    the public, which implies a second question: if they were, would they be worth
    acquiring? My answer to both is no. The prospect of Carter taking a fresh look
    at Bembo is profoundly exciting, especially since Morison's 1929 is the only version
    extant. We don't know what his client specified, but the Yale tweaking is deeply
    disappointing relative to the type market, and I hope Carter could still revisit
    Bembo with more creative effect. There is a market demand to revive older pre-Morison
    Bembos, delving deeper into the Renaissance source material for a funkier, more
    charming result, more like a Dupr\xE9 face. "

    a more useable version of Bembo. \"Something went wrong\" in the transfer to digital
    (or maybe even in the transfer to phototype? I'm too young to tell) of the standard
    MT Bembo and its offsprings.\r\n\r\n&lt;rant&gt;\r\nHell, Tufte even had his own
    Bembo made because the commercially available ones are mostly crummy.\r\n\r\nAs
    for a bold, or even a --shudder-- bold italic: What are you thinking? Did Manuce
    have a bold italic? Does anyone <em>need</em> bold italics? We would live in a
    much better world if it weren't for bold italics!\r\n&lt;/(h)rant&gt;"

    he was accustomed to having books set in Monotype metal Bembo by Michael and Winnie
    Bixler (for offset repro, no less). He has the same prejudice we all have: \"Metal
    Bembo is so great, why is the digital so weak?\" and he knew metal Bembo.\r\n\r\nOne
    partial answer to that complaint is the new, OpenType Bembo Book, which Robin
    Nicholas based on a different size master than the earlier digital version. It's
    stronger. "
