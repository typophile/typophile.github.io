  target="_blank"><i>On the Media</i></a> this week? He&#39;s such a gentleman --
  even laughed obligingly when the interviewer said he was &#34;a font of knowledge,&#34;
  yuk yuk yuk. &#40;The story was about the NYT headline overhaul with Cheltenham.&#41;

  body: I remember Matthew&#39;s amusement at being introduced at the HOW conference
    a few years ago as &#39;a living icon&#39;. He thought it made him sound like
    an animated bitmap in the corner of one&#39;s desktop.

    I saw this thread. I turned on NPR and it&#39;s Matthew Carter, though I only
    heard the end of the interview. What a nice surprise it was. <BR>But I&#39;m even
    more surprised after reading the first few paragraphs of the interview. I just
    used Cheltenham as a headline font on a recent &#40;and very small&#41; project
    about fire trucks. &#40;And I&#39;m not even close to being a font of knowledge&#41;
    <BR>I&#39;ve really been interested lately in slab serifs, it started when I read
    this short article by Robin Williams awhile back: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.eyewire.com/magazine/columns/robin/slabserifs/index.htm"

    <BR>  <BR>My other favorite slab at the moment is Chaparral MM. Anyhow, going
    to read the rest of the interview, thanks for the On the Media link! '

  body: He is witty, but I don&#39;t think OTM did a very good job interviewing him
    &#40;despite that it&#39;s one of my favorite NPR programs&#41;. I thought the
    earlier interview -- the one where the interviewer tried to give him credit for
    Helvetica -- was better.

  body: Meredith, just for the record, Matthew did design Helvetica Compressed, Extra
    Compressed, and Ultra Compressed in 1966 for Linotype filmsetting. I didn&#39;t
    hear that interview, so I don&#39;t know if those might be what the interviewer
    was crediting him for. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Meredith, that interview wasn&#39;t aimed at anyone who has a clue about type
    or type design. It was a piece of fluff. So I take it for what it is, fun and
    lighthearted. I bet most people who read the Times didn&#39;t notice the difference.
