  else can we find kerning beside type? And saw we use kerning eveywhere. It's just
  called differently. One name for it in real life would be \"double measure\" when
  you apply different principals/acting/behaviour/etc. with different ethnicity/gender/etc.\r\n\r\nCan
  you come up with kerning in other areas of life? Mechanics perhaps? Other professions?\r\n\r\nSeeing
  that kerning exists eveywhere made me think why the **** did <cite>they</cite> name
  it \"kerning\" in type design?"

  body: "littera: <cite>why the **** did they name it \u201Ckerning\u201D in type
    design?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, the question is really why do <em>we</em> call it
    \"kerning.\" <em>They</em> had something slightly different in mind when the term
    was coined.\r\n\r\n\"Kerning\" is one of those terms that has been leveraged from
    one technology to the next, to the point where it's evolved quite a bit from its
    origins, not unlike \"leading.\"\r\n\r\nHere's a relevant excerpt from Harry Carter's
    translation of <cite>Manuel Typographique,</cite> the 18th-century manual on typefounding
    by Fournier le Jeune.\r\n\r\n\"Another essential operation performed with the
    same knife is <em>kerning.</em> This is a matter of hollowing out beneath the
    little projecting strokes which overlap the shanks upon which the letters are
    cast. In the roman alphabet this occurs in the case of f, [long-s], ff, [double-long-s].
    These characters have isolated beaks which are only supported by being joined
    on by the face to the rest of the letter. Kerning consists in hollowing out the
    under-sides of these beaks so that they may overhang the letter which adjoins
    them. When these little beaks are kerned, the edge of the knife is passed up and
    down the shank on the kerned side.\" \r\n[from <cite>Fournier on Typefounding</cite>
    (1764), Harry Carter, trans., 1930]\r\n\r\nThe term in Fournier's original is
    <em>cr\xE9nerie (n.)/cr\xE9ner (v.)</em>, from which, I believe, the English \"kern\"
    is derived. Moxon is earlier than Fournier. He would have gotten his information
    probably via the French, possibly the Dutch. I wonder if he coined the English
    term. I'm not sure why the dictionaries cite <em>carne</em> as the French source.
    I'd be curious to see what they use to support this derivation.\r\n\r\nBecause
    of the tremendous work involved and the fragility of the results, few characters
    were designed to have kerns (i.e. overhanging parts) in metal. \r\n\r\nIt is only
    when you come to the photo and digital ages, with virtual sidebearings, that you
    begin to encounter the kind of widespread contextual repositioning that we think
    of as kerning today.\r\n\r\n-- K."
