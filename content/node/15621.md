  a public (non-commercial) radio station based out of Santa Monica College that happens
  to have a consistently excellent music show, <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=76016777\">Morning
  Becomes Eclectic</a> with host Nic Harcourt. The show always involves the band coming
  in the studio for a live 40 minute session.\r\n\r\nWell, they've always had Real
  Audio streams (which have had sub-par quality over the years) but they've recently
  made the show available as a <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=76016777\">Podcast</a>
  (Link requires iTunes).  \r\n\r\nRecent bands include Clap Your Hands and Say Yeah
  and a gem out of Tijuana, called Nortec Collective. Yum."
