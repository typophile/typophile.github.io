  body: Whatever it is, it's heavily customised. look at how perfectly the letters
    are made to interlock (with a very short E bar and a proportionally tiny lower
    E serif). I'm thinking it probably started its life as a [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/century-expanded-sh/|Century]],
    was rounded with the help of an added (blue) stroke, and then the E was modified
    to not hit the C.
