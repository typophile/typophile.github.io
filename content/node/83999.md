  Windows 2008 server. Now saving (simply doing a Ctrl + S or File, Save) takes as
  long as 30-45 seconds. The font files size doesn't seem to matter much, even fonts
  that aren't particularly large take a looooong time to save.\r\n\r\nI've tried uninstalling
  and reinstalling to no avail.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen"

  body: try to use Fontforge as well - anytime Fontlab may have problems, you can
    use the Fontforge's parachute! :)

    reckon that this hasn\u2019t anything to do with FLS as such. There seem to be
    all sorts of slowdown-issues related to the use of SMB2 (Server Message Block
    Protocol Version 2) in <em>Windows 2008 Server</em>. Some Googling on <a href=\"http://www.petri.co.il/how-to-disable-smb-2-on-windows-vista-or-server-2008.htm\">this
    subject</a> might perhaps help. \r\n\r\nFEB"
