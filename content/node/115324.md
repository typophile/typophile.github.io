    typeface. Thanks!"

  body: "You'll notice that the Swash caps Nick used in Parsnip do not match the P
    in the sample. Nick's are the same as the ones shown for Parsons in McGrew's book
    on \"American Metal Typefaces..\", so this tells me the P in the sample was a
    customization, and not from the original design. In fact the swash initials were
    not in the original design \u2014 Sidney Gaunt designed them, and Ransom did not
    approve them all, yet McGrew says they were cast by BB&S.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
