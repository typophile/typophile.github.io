  <BR> <BR>these kind of logos seem to be/get very popular these days. splitting the
  name in 2 words, setting one half regular, the other one bold. in germany i notice
  more and more of these logos each do.  <BR>what&#39;s your opinion on them? are
  they &#34;popular&#34; in your country, too? is there already a name/description
  for this style? lars

    in english. There was once an article in U&amp;LC about the longest word and it
    turned out to be a german word on a train station. It ment something like: place,
    down from the church across the stream, etc.'

    be beaten by the infamous welsh village Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
    &#40;or Llanfair PG for short&#41; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    like to use what Perl programmers refer to as camel case, as in TrainStation or
    HamBurger. Yucks.

  body: In fact &#40;sorry for the double post&#41; the more I think about it I think
    you mean that word, Daniel. They are known for their train station sign and the
    name mentions a church. See the sign in its full glory at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch"

    all we have is Grand Central Station, boring, except for the other day when 450
    women were photographed nude  by the information booth. Dan
