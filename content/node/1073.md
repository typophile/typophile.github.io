    very typographic and a little like Louise Fili&#39;s work. Saw it once, but I
    can&#39;t find it anymore. So if anyone knows the link, please post it. Thanks!

  body: One of my students just pointed out the Gerhard Huerta site from James&#39;
    link, and yes, the work is great. One question arises though. Previously, I&#39;ve
    been told that Jim Parkinson is reponsible for the Barnum &amp; Bailey&#39;s circus
    logo, but it is shown on Huerta&#39;s site. Although my guess is that either Huerta
    or Parkinson is the art director while the other actually drew the letters, some
    explanation from one of them might clear up any perceived confusion.

  body: '&#62; <BR> <BR>The thing about logos is that a lot of people have their hands
    on them. <BR> <BR>Jim Parkinson did the RB&amp;BB logo, and later on Gerard redrew
    it for a new art director. If you compare the two they are slightly different.
    Gerard worked on the logo before he got involved with digital techniques, so he
    hired me to digitize the logo for him. I digitized it using an Aristo Tablet working
    in IKARUS, man you should have seen that data! <BR> <BR>Both Jim Parkinson and
    I have similar SELF logos on our website. Who did what, when, is lost in the fog
    of time. <BR> <BR> '

    from a creativepro.com article of June 8, 2001 <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/13506.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/13506.html</a> about
    Parkinson. In it, the caption to the RB&amp;BB logo says: &#34;The design for
    the circus has lasted for over twenty years.&#34; I must have assumed &#40;incorrectly&#41;
    that it meant the design has remained &#34;unchanged&#34; for twenty years. My
    mistake. Again, thanks.'

    He was even kind enough to autograph them for me and I didn&#39;t even ask. Also,
    they were packaged very securely and arrived promptly. <BR> <BR>I mean come on,
    this guy has been hand lettering logotypes for over 40 years and teaching at Art
    Center for nearly 30! As I said before, they are the best book purchases I&#39;ve
