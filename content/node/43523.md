  figure out what several fonts are to try and match them. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nI went
  through all the fonts on my computer but couldn't come up with a match for the numbers.
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/204_6236.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso I need to match
  these fonts if you know them\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/engine1_6332.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/engine2_3933.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/engine3_6511.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/engine4_5119.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  really appreciate any feedback!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJason"
