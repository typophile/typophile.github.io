  years I've admired the font on the first Pretenders album, and now maybe someone
  can help me identify it.   I did a search and didn't find anything already here,
  which surprised me as this is such a distictive font.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pretenders_album_4924.jpg]"
