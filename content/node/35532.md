    to match it looking at the Retro category at Dafont.com -- the reason I looked
    there is this seems like a good candidate to be an amateur effort. I also looked
    in the Art Nouveau collection at MyFonts.com, with no luck either. this looks
    like another job for Angel or Mike F.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
