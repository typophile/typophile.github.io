    the Crime pages, all the numbers are marked with an asterix, information design
    is all about making the information as simple as possible, and getting rid on
    any unnecessary information. As every number is marked it would probably be a
    wise thing to mention in the text somewhere that all these figures represent per
    1000 people rather than having an asterix beside them all.\r\n\r\nThe same goes
    for the percentage symbol on the Canabis Use page, you could mention that these
    figures represent a percentage, maybe in a small text just below the table.\r\n\r\nM"

    you have to make a judgement call, both sides of the figures ragged, or a slightly
    ragged decimal point, both very minimal, I personally would be ok with a little
    ragged point. \r\n\r\nBut thats just me\r\n\r\n:}"

    asterisk notation in the copy, and drop the asterisks themselves. If every datum
    has the same measurement / unit, there's no point in putting the asterisk on every
    line.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd drop the indent a little bit, and I'd make the titles to
    the different sections (\"High Crimes and Punishments\") flush left.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    you're splitting the key on pages 121 and 122. I'd try to have those on the same
    spread, if at all possible. Otherwise, there's a bit of a break between the usage
    of the key and the key itself.\r\n\r\nI really like the faded graphics. That's
    a nice touch."

  body: "As stated, decimal numbers need to be aligned on the decimal. You may also
    want to see how it looks using lining numerals.\r\n\r\nThe indents bother me too.
    Indents are used to separate one paragraph from the previous one. However, if
    there is only one paragraph, there's no need to indent it. (So, all that said,
    don't indent the first paragraph in a block of paragraphs).\r\n\r\nThe colored
    boxes are a bit bold. I'd maybe fade them out a tad more. Personal preference
    would also be to give the boxes a bit of padding around the edge and the type.
    Give the type a bit of room.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would probably be ambitious, but
    a lot of this data looks suited for a presentation via maps."

    look a bit lost. The "arrow" symbols are standing out more than the copy, maybe
    fade those back a bit or reduce in size? By the way, .pdf files would be more
    helpful. It's tough to really see these pages clearly.

  body: "As others are suggesting, there are a variety of spacing and alignment issues,
    but the primary \"problem\" with the samples in general is an overall \"cold\"
    design: that is, the design feels really static, uninviting, mechanical. This
    is partially due to the all-sans type, but equally tied to a strangely rigid yet
    chaotic layout. The various content types feel forced into place, rather than
    feeling as though they're exactly where they should be, likely due to too many
    different alignment points that are competing with each other.\r\n\r\nTo me, the
    stand-out bugs are the poorly padded/spaced boxes on 121, and the mess of 122,
    but these are just examples of a fairly pervasive situation throughout the document."

    i will understand what i am reading, but when it comes time to put it into practice
    i find that i often need more concrete or specific examples to really help me.

  body: "Page 103 of the new samples, to my mind, is a good example of the problem.
    There is a rigidity to the page, and yet each element still feels like it's floating.
    What compounds the issue is, as others have mentioned, the indenting. I'm not
    entirely sure why you've indented your heads/subheads, and in general your indent
    looks too deep (especially considering how many one-line paragraphs you have to
    work with).\r\n\r\nBe careful, however, in taking my comments too much to heart.
    For instance, my advise on your list of books would be to throw <em>Stop Stealing
    Sheep...</em> in the garbage. I evaluated a copy a couple of years ago for possible
    use in my class (I teach publication design) and found myself cringing at each
    spread. That book seems an incredibly efficient way to totally mess up new students
    of typography. Beyond that, I'm fairly conservative in my typographic tastes,
    which in this case speaks to my comment on the all-sans setting, which to me is
    sort of like setting a table with steel cutlery, steel plates and steel glasses.
    Utensils (like captions) are built for utility, but plates and tumblers should
    combine function and form: they should not only hold your food and drink, but
    should add visual flavour as well. On the table this might mean anything from
    classical china and crystal to chipped and much-loved stoneware, but in either
    case the setting has personality. All-sans, however, is sort of like an entire
    table setting of shiny metal: clean, sleek and simple, but also cold, bland and
    lifeless.\r\n\r\nBut you've already conceded this point, so I'm really just indulging
    myself here. My apologies.\r\n\r\nAs for concrete suggestions, I'd remove the
    indents from the heads/subheads and maybe find a different face for these, something
    with a bit of personality that will contrast well with the body type. And reduce
    the depth of the indents across the board. As for the boxes, try something as
    simple as adding rounded corners, and make sure you have some padding added in
    every box (note the bottom of your boxes on 121)."
