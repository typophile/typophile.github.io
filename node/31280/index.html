  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just modified an Adobe font for a client for their in-house use. But then they asked me to work on two weights of Helvetica. Of course I said I think that's not allowed & sure enough that's right. So then I asked my fine pals at FontShop about this & they told me that; yes, almost everybody wants to either prohibit that now or do that work themselves - which is their perogative. But I still have this client & I am bound to ask on their behalf: 

- If they bought the font before the EULA changed and can prove it, where am I?
- Can you think of a Helvetica-alike with at least two weights whose EULA is more Adobe/Shinn type like? I would prefer they used an indie font anyway. 
- What if they buy various Helveticas from Adobe? Does the Adobe EULA apply?

Certainly if there is no legal way to do they work I will refuse and refer them to Mono-Lino.

But if there is a legal/ethical way to get this done I would like to do that.

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I believe Lino's EULA still applies if purchased from Adobe as Adobe is simply a reseller of Linotype fonts, just like FontShop. But I am not certain of this. Perhaps there is some sublicensing agreement that allows Adobe to apply their EULA.

<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica_alternatives.cfm">Helvetica Alternates</a>, just in time.

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen:
This has been discussed numerous times. The EULA offered by the vendor to the buyer is the EULA that the buyer agrees to: if you enter into an agreement with Adobe, it's Adobe's terms you've agreed to, not Linotype's. 

That's a major reason to buy from Adobe: they often have better terms than the original foundry.  Take MVB Celestia™ Antiqua: license it from Adobe, and you can embed it for print and preview (see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html">this list</a>); get it from MVB themselves, and "if you have purchased a Basic License, you may distribute a PDF containing the subset-embedded Font Software to not more than five (5) computers at your one geographical location." See more <a href="http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/info/contents/eula.htm">here.</a>

Major players like Adobe and Microsoft manage to negotiate more favourable terms for their clients: that's why you can find editable embedding versions of fonts in Microsoft products that, if purchased from another vendor might not allow _any_ embedding. That's how Simon Daniels explained it to me.

See <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?14@@.3bc319b0/0">this </a> very recent thread on Adobe's forums.

And, unless the EULA has a clause saying that the agreement is subject to future unilateral alterations (and, sadly, such EULAs _do_ exist!), the agreement you made when the money changed hands is the agreement you have.

It pays to shop EULAs!

Now can you modify Adobe's Helvetica? Well, that's one for the lawyers! Maybe it is easier to go with one of your alternates.

In the other thread, the key point is this, Question #11 from the Adobe Font FAQ

11. Can I customize a font using font manipulation software?
You are allowed to use font manipulation software to modify the font software to produce “derivatives” of fonts licensed from Adobe, as long as you use the derivatives in accordance with the same licensing terms that accompany the original fonts. For example, you can use Macromedia Fontographer or Pyrus FontLab to customize an Adobe Font for individual usage, but you are not permitted to distribute, sell, or give away, the derivative work, and the derivative work counts as one of the permitted number of uses.

Let me know if anything is still unclear.

2) It sounds illegal.

Bingo.

That's up to the lawyers to decide, as they see fit.
