  film projects is made (credits/opener)? Is it made in software like After Effects
  and Illustrator/Flash? Or are are other specific post production/Digital Intermediate
  machines used? I would be happy for every advise or link. \r\n\r\nThanks Sebastian"

  body: Indeed, After Effects is probably used quite often for such work. For the
    rest applications like 3DS Max and Maya, etc.

    is done in whatever apps the effects house is using and probably comped together
    in After Effects\u2014which is at least used to render some stuff it does much
    faster than hardware/raytracing engines can do alone."
