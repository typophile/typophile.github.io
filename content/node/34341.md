  and I am looking for a fun font. To give you an idea of content, check out trini
  scene.com, trini pulse.com and island vibes.com (again, no spaces in the names).
  I am looking for something nice, to put as the site logo, to make Tshirts and to
  use as a logo for watermarking images. We\u2019re just stumped here and I understand
  this is an excellent community where typography is concerned, so any help would
  be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nP.S The reason I put the URLS with no spaces is because
  I don\u2019t want anyone to happen to find this post, want to keep it secret ;)\r\n"
