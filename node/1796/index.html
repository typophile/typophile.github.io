<div class=commentbody>Good suggestion. Eagle would probably be a good choice for this industry. <br> <br>During my initial consultation with the client, we determined that the most important elements to the customer relationship are trust and reliability. Recognizing the need for boldness ("aggressive and macho") within industry applications and considering the look of reliability, I created the bold DETEX type. Also recognizing that most pest control is sold door-to-door during the day, I knew that the logo needed to be soft enough for a predominantly female market, hense, the soft "E's" and the gray (vs. Unocal blue) and orange (vs. the industry standard red) combination. I felt that this would help create warmth, rather than aggressive heat, and contribute to the trust factor. <br> <br>I'm thinking that the space between the name and title on the bizcard needs to be decreased</div>

<div class=commentbody>Scott, I like the colors and the overall look! <br>Maybe you could use the orange element at the end of the word "Detex" to build the "E". I think the look should be more aggressive that way? <br> <br>I don't think you should consider the female market as a market that want a softer look... that's just constructed ideas. The female market are not that easy. I think you could go more "macho". <br> <br>The businesscards; are you showing the front and back of them in your preview, or is it just the front? Can you maybe show them with cuttingmarks? <br> <br>Andreas</div>

<div class=commentbody>i think it's great! much nicer than other pest control identities. i see tons of bad blue-collar business logos. good job. <br> <br>two things though: maybe try making the two E's a little wider. they seem not as wide as the D for example. it makes the word DETEX look a little weaker, when it should be stronger. <br> <br>also, the TM annoys me a little in its current location. i suggest moving it somewhere that isn't so noticeable. it sticks out because it's creating a tension with the corner and making you notice it. maybe move it down next to the L. i dont know. good job though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Your work is beautiful. <br> <br>To me the only question is what suits the market. <br> <br>Your analysis of the market is great, but ideally you would go on and test out more & less aggressive versions using the business's existing customers & see the reaction. <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Gray and Orange are a good combination, although a bit overused -- your designers delight looks better than the reflex blue look, which of course is bolder but simply doesn't work as nice and will of course need a third colour in printing for the text, which shouldn't be blue. <br> <br>I absolutely do not like the way E and T as well E and X are done in one shape, almost as ligatured. It looks too clever for its own good... I think a cleaner and simpler approach would be nicer and would probably have more longevity. <br> <br>The business card is just great, the although I'm sure the before bug shouldn't be just a fly (no one calls pest control for that) and the after bug should maybe just be more of a kind of red smear :-). Of course though, the shape of the card and the fly are a perfect fit and maybe a cockroach on your bizcard isn't the best idea... :-D. Maybe the DETEX could be a bit smaller and the typeface for the name and tel# and so on isn't my cuppa, for that kinda business and that logo a sans serif would be a better fit. <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Scott, I don't know if they're common enough (I mean as a houeshold problem) to deserve first dibs, but my impression (from having a hell of a time fighting them off, on two different continents) is that RATS are the most fearsome of pests. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Try flipping that EX ligature so that both joins are along the top. I think that would make it read faster, no longer leading the eye to wander up and down. <br> <br>I just noticed that the S in PEST looks awfully wide. I know that's how it comes in Handel, but in that context and letterspacing, it's out of place. <br> <br>Hrant, that is probably true, but as a symbol rats are problematic. Some people don't like to think about killing cute fuzzy animals, whereas <i>everybody</i> hates insects. Also, you can't fit a life-sized rat on a business card.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Few random comments: <br> <br>The blue ain't bad...let the client have that one. The grey is nice, but tends to be 'the thing' to do these days. Not sure how timeless it will be (if that is an issue). <br> <br>I like your t-shirt/hat mock-up. Perhaps just make those the corporate colors and let them use blue vs. grey depending on situation.' <br> <br>I don't usually consider flies a pest. A bit annoying, but usually a sign that the mulch needs taking out rather than a need for an exterminator. As for insects-that-fit-on-a-bcard, I'd say the ant is a good idea. Or a termite. <br> <br>The TM looks much better outside the orange field. <br> <br>The logo-esque 'e' in PEST bothers me. Not sure why, but I read it as P EST. Maybe use a squarer 'e' in the tag line.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is nice. I think I prefer the orange hat. Has anyone asked about the word spacing in between "pest" and "control"? Scott, I think you could fix this by lowering that line just a bit and then removing some of the word spacing. I agree with the remark about the TM as well. It does need to be less conspicuously placed. <br> <br>Your work is consistently good. Nice analysis as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm actually liking the client's color choice - and three is too many. <br> <br>I'd close up the "ET" a bit, and open up the "X"-shape space. <br> <br>I'm not sure about the italic. You already have an[other] angle in the paper's cut. Smallcaps instead? <br> <br>And I'd use midpoints (but not huge bullets) instead of periods in the phone numbers. <br> <br>> I LOVE the rat tail idea, but I think it might be a little morbid. <br> <br>Well, you wouldn't show it cut - just coming out of the right edge - like it's hightailing it outa there or soemething. And/or that angled cut in the paper could be symbolic of a trap. You could even use differently curling tails for each employee. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I hate to do this to you, but I'm siding with the client too in terms of color. Grey is a hard sell to a client, IMHO, so you may want to save your energies for a different battle ;o) <br> <br>The card is nice. Two nitpicks: <br> - no URL. I can't trust a company without a web site. ;o) <br> - dots in the phone number. Me no like. Seems 'trendy in art school but not really pratical in the real world' IMHO. <br> <br>I like that ant. A lot! But I'm thinking the back of the card is too much/too obvious. I'd suggest just having the ant as-is on the front and not try to push the whole before/after concept. If you do keep the ant on the back, I think it needs to somehow look 'more dead'. Not sure how to go about that, though. Maybe a chalk outline? Headstone? Dunno...just thinking outloud... <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Scott, <br> <br>I like the design. However, I would like to see a darker blue that doesn't have as much brightness. Because the orange is bright, I think a duller blue would make the orange and blue work better together. Your "e's" feel like they have too much curve. I also don't like the middle bars being different lengths than the outer bars. <br> <br>The "E" connecting only at the bottom of the "X" seems odd because the top has the same relationship as the bottom, and they don't connect. (I hope that made sense) I don't see anything wrong with just joining the e and the t. Joining the "e" and "x" seems forced. <br> <br>I think pest control could be a sans serif different than the title. I just used univers- I am sure you could find a better one. The orange arrow feels better with the same space between it and the "x" as the thickness of the font. I Hope this helps. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19345.gif alt> <br> <br>-Tom</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, a little more with the S. <br> <br>On the back of the card, merely saying "This is the void where the ant was" doesn't really communicate the idea so well. If you can make the white ant look really dead (a dead insect, when not smooshed, is generally curled up with all its legs folded inward), you won't need to spell out "after" in words at all. I think that would be a good thing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Scott. <br> <br>Not bad so far. <br> <br>Nice card shape - corresponding with the logo. <br> <br>But: the before/after thing (as is) does not at all work for me. Nobody can tell (without inspecting the card with a magnifier) which ant (or fly) is alive and which is killed. People might think: "Before: grey fly, after: white fly - cool, that's what I always wanted to spend my money for". :-) <br> <br>And do away with that "see other side for 'before'" instruction. That sounds sort of silly. ,-) <br> <br>Maybe the happy vermin/poisoned vermin idea would work if somehow differently done. But, actually, I'm not sure whether such a (tendentially nasty) illustration should be on a card. Maybe it should. I'm a bit undecided here. ,-) <br> <br>I wouldn't make the job title lowercase only. I see no reason to do this. <br> <br>I guess I don't prefer the grey over the customer's blue. <br>The grey might seem to be a bit more sophisticated, but IMO the dark blue suits the business well. <br>Hrant's right: three colors in the logo are too much. <br>Tom's colors are very strong. I think I like them. <br> <br>regards <br>jpg</div>

<div class=commentbody>I know we're entering the subjective world <br>of color preferences now, but while Tom's <br>colors are bold, they creep back into the <br>gas-station color pallete that scott was <br>trying to avoid.

<div class=commentbody>I tend to like the client's rather gentler blue. <br> <br>The thing that bothers me about the EX-ligature is the angle that the upper arm of the X is cut at - if it ended vertically rather than horizontally, I think it might flow better. (Unfortunately this unbalances the top of the glyph and makes the orange arrow look forced). <br> <br>I'll second the curled-up legs for the dead insect; the splat effect could be in poor taste. <br> <br>The complaint regarding the shape of the logo Es: what if only the bottom arm had a corner with the stem? The stem can retain its bow-curve, but you can also reinforce the baseline and eliminate the instability that the ET ligature has.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you all for the incredible critique. Unfortunately, I have become somewhat overloaded with work and will not have time to address each of your helpful comments, but let me assure you that I have used all of your postings to get this design to where it is now. <br> <br>Due to a client response lull, I had some time away from this project. I hope that I remembered everything that I intended to do. Take a look and let me know if I'm still missing some things. I tried to apply a lot of changes to this revision this afternoon and I fear I may have even missed some of the positive adjustments I made on previous versions. <br> <br>The colors are confirmed and due to budget constraints, I need to keep the cards down to 2/1. Because of this we now have a dark blue ant. I think it is small enough that it will still work. On the reverse side, I went with the ant on its back with its let up in the air. The tag line, "after DETEX", probably needs to be present for people who haven't followed this thread to get it. <br> <br>Thanks again for all your help. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19798.jpg alt="Detex Identity"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Scott, everything is looking good here. I wouldn't worry about that other detex logo, sometimes certain letters just come together in certain ways. <br> <br>My only note is that I am not so sure on the type on the back of the card. HAving pest controller off to the right isn't sitting that well with me. Perhaps there needs to be a little more of a margin between the text on the left and the text on the right. I do see why you are shifting towards the right, but perhaps it needs to move over 20 pixels. <br> <br>just a thought</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Scott <br>I really like your design, especially the use of the orange wedge shape, which is repeated in the shape of the card. <br> <br>When I was growing up in Florida (I now live in Washington) there was this pest control company that had a cute mouse-like logo, and their vehicles were bright yellow VW Bugs with big three-dimensional mouse ears on the roof, a big mouse tail attached to the rear end, and three-dimensional whiskers attached to the front bumper. As a child it was fun to spot them in the sea of otherwise boring 70s-mobiles (ah, suburban sprawl). <br>I looked them up and they're still around (maybe you've heard of them -- people here in the Northeast haven't). I'm attaching a couple of jpegs. An example of rare humor in the pest control industry. <br> <br>Their "mouse" logo became so familiar to people in that area that the company started doing ads with a sign-off of the mouse ears, whiskers and tail without the words Truly Nolen... sort of like what Target does now. <br> <br>Good luck with your project. <br> <br>Troy <br> <br> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20213.jpg alt="image 1"><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20214.jpg alt="image 2"></div>

<div class=commentbody>In case anyone's interested. The trucks turned out OK. I had a flashier design for the trucks that involved a lot more orange, but it was too expensive. So we went conservative, but it still makes a loud professional statement considering the small size of this pest control company (5 trucks). <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23985.jpg alt="Detex truck"> <br> <br>BTW, the orange hose was just one of those luck of the Irish (I'm about an eighth Irish) coincidences.</div>
