  body: "In Washington, Iowa, there is a street named South Avenue D. Probably in
    many other places, also.\r\n\r\nThe street sign there, though, is done in all
    cap abbreviations, thus S AVE D.\r\n\r\nBut the letterfit and word space are such
    that, driving by at 35 mph, it reads as SAVED. Which made me feel very good as
    I drove past it several times a few months ago, terrible sinner that I yam. Without
    a camera, so you'll just have to imagine it. I shall probably never drive by that
    sign again, and if I do, I shall not likely have a camera. But the message will
    always be there, and those searching for South Avenue C or South Avenue E will
    see that message and  know that all will be OK.\r\n\r\npowers "
