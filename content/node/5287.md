  community for fans of the Los Angles Lakers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve designed some new
  logos which will be used on the website as well as on some CafeShops items. <BR>

  body: 'Your new logo design is better than the one currently on the website. The
    &#34;LG&#34; seems redundant on the versions with the text portion and at smaller
    sizes is hard to distinguish.   <BR> <BR>The &#34;S&#34; doesn&#39;t seem right
    - sort of floating above the baseline or maybe reworking the lower curve.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, your Cafe Press shop doesn&#39;t appear to have any items on it.  <BR>
