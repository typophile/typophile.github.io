  body: "I'm curious what the point is of identifying the fonts in all these rock
    band logos? I think you said before that you're using them in a fanzine (or something
    similar.) If that's the case, you've already got them scanned, why not just use
    the scanned images? \r\nUnless you need to set text in a similar font, I don't
    know why you'd go through the effort of trying to re-create these from fonts.
    After all, having the fonts is only one part of re-creating the logo, then you
    need to set the text exactly the same as it was set in the logo, and use any effects
    applied.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "I like to re-create the logos with similar font because if I use a scanner
    I don't have only the band logo, but also the background and other things in the
    cover of cd near the logo of the band. I found many fonts of rock band in the
    web (iron maiden, metallica, megadeth and others), but some it's difficult to
    find.\r\nIn this forum I found many people really experts!\r\nthanx to all!!!\r\n\r\nsorry
    for my english!"
