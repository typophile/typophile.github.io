body: Any thoughts on what I call, for lack of a better term, a "European" figure
  1 (the one with a more obvious top arm)?  How appropriate is it?  Should it become
  the standard, as opposed to this -> 1?  Any advice, technical or otherwise, on the
  design of this version?

  body: Scott, are you designing something and need this or are you just wondering
    about the technical name? As far as I know, it is part of the means by which they
    learn to write the figure 1. I know my Italian cousins all use it.

  body: "It's probable that the \"European '1'\" can have a larger head because/when
    the \"7\" has a crossbar.\r\n\r\nIn terms of type design, the larger head certainly
    helps when the font is monospaced.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
