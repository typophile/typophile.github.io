  body: It looks like a little outline editing has been used on the A, i and T &#40;for
    example&#41;, but the basic font outlines are almost all the same. I believe Roundhouse
    was the starting point for the sample&#39;s lettering.

  body: Wow, thanks. <BR> <BR>Do you know any sites which sell this font on its own
    - without the whole collection?  <BR> <BR>And can you give me the site which your
    image was from i&#39;d be grateful - so I might be able to see any similar fonts.

  body: Unfortunately, House believes in selling their fonts only in packages, and
    only through  their own site. I have written to them, and they seemed very clear
    about that. <BR> <BR>My site is  at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com" target="_blank">
    bowfinprintworks.com</a> and the part that sample came from is the <a href="http://Script05Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide, Part 5</a>.
