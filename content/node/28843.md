  body: The Didones are beyond over used in fashion to the point of being cliches.
    It may be the most obvious and appropriate choice here.

  body: "Helvetica with extremely tight tracking also works well. For the first half
    of a title, use the Thin weight; for the last half, Heavy. Either go all upper
    or all lowercase, or a combination of both (thin and lower, heavy and upper, or
    vice versa).\r\n\r\nThis also works with Avant Garde as previously mentioned,
    or combining a heavy Didone with a thin grotesque, or vice versa.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Use <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=536">House
    Luxury</a> while it's still new. It's certainly appropriate for fashion, not to
    mention being totally gorgeous.

  body: Can  you choose weights of the Didone that are optically even? I'd scratch
    using the sans and stick with all Didone.

    might try <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Anisette">Anisette
