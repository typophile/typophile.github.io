  body: I would say that is almost certainly custom designed. You might try Jukebox&#39;s
    Fenway Park for a similar &#34;baseball&#34; feel. You can get it at veer.com
    &#40;sorry, it&#39;s not free&#41;. <BR> <BR>If anyone else has other &#34;baseball&#34;
    face suggestions, I&#39;d love to hear them, as well. <BR> <BR>Jeff
