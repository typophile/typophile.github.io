  War (WW2).  They are often small and can be found anywhere.  Almost all of them
  with any reference to the invading fascists or the defense against them used the
  same general, black sans \"chisel-face\" that reminds me of a heavy Neutraface (especially
  the \"4\").  I wish I had taken more pictures of them, but that was still in the
  days of film.  The style would seem to invoke a sense of strength and heavy armor.\r\n\r\nHere's
  one I did take, at St. Isaac's Cathederal in Peterburg.  The caption is \"This is
  evidence of one of the 148478 shells fired by the fascists on Leningrad in 1941-44\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SovMonument4_5834.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  found a few more images on the web.  Here are a couple from the war monument at
  Murmansk.  The caption is roughly \"To the defenders of the Soviet polar region\".
  \ If you look closely, you can see that the word \"Soviet\" (\u0421\u041E\u0412\u0415\u0421\u0422\u041A\u041E\u0413\u041E)
  in the middle appears to have been modified-in to replace some other word, probably
  erasing Stalin or something:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SovMonument1_4110.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SovMonument2_5036.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's
  another Murmansk monument.  The caption is hard to make out but something like \"In
  memory of the fighters and builders of Murmansk [something]\" and of course the
  usual \"1941-45\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SovMonument3_5907.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  found a picture of a Polish monument also, differs somewhat but conveys the same
  general sense perhaps.  I'm not sure what the symbol on the top is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/warsawwar06_6499.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere
  is one from Treptower Park, Berlin.  The caption is \"Patriotic War\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/052-Treptower_Symbol_5312.jpg]\r\n\r\n...
  but compare to the Berlin \"polynational\" monument, I believe at the same park,
  apparently for more \"external\" consumption.  The English and Russian captions
  read the same:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Berlin1_3654.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Berlin3_5366.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  use of memorials and seemingly-related \"cult of the Soviet war dead\" is discussed
  a bit in Geographical Review:\r\n\r\nhttp://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-13834/The-Soviet-War-Memorial-in.html\r\n\r\nI'm
  neither designer, advertiser, nor professional propagandist, but I see a pattern
  here.  Any additional insights anyone may wish to share would be appreciated."

    I guess they came to similar conclusions when trying to make a very bold geometric

    (however belatedly, from the Polish and Czech point of view): perhaps Totalitarian
    or Stalinist but not Fascist lettering here ... the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s were
    much weirder than the 70\u2019s."

  body: Paragraph is correct.  You can view this as the Soviets branding their opposition,
    or branding opposition to their opposition...  Philosophically and in terms of
    propaganda methods and styles, there appears to be little actual difference between
    either side, it's simply our totalitarians versus your totalitarians.

  body: "I'm interested in how long after the war these monuments were made. Obviously
    they weren't made immediately after so we aren't necessarily looking at the lettering
    styles that opposed fascism at the time it was invading these countries\r\n\r\nI
    visit Poland a lot as my partner is from there and I see a lot of similar monumental
    lettering still being done on recent gravestones in cemeteries. This photo was
    from a month ago and I think the stone was only a few years old. (Not a great
    photo as it was trimmed from the edge of what I was actually focusing on.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PolishCemetary_4995.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for that link to the Warsaw Uprising badges, paragraph!"

  body: "You\u2019re welcome, Justin. The shapes of the heavy-wide-solid sans could
    relate to the promoted self-image of the Soviets at the time, with the main idea
    of being the defenders rather than the aggressors (never mind Poland, Finland
    and the Baltic states), and solid and dependable rather than fickle and opportunistic
    (switching sides in WW1, the Ribbentrop\u2013Molotov Pact, etc.)."
