body: What are some of the styles of fonts that you almost never see?  By style I
  mean structure, not weight.  For example, I don't believe I have ever seen anything
  as ornate as Poppl Residenz, but done as a stencil.  Or perhaps an inline handwriting
  font.  Something like these may very well exist, But I have never personally seen
  them.  Looking for styles that are very rare or may not even exist at all.  Latin
  only please.  Ideas?
