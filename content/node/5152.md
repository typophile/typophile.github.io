body: Hi All, <BR> <BR>I would really appreciate some assistance in identifying the
  font used in the attached image, which is part of a logo that is owned by my Employer.  He
  has asked me to make a few changes to the whole logo, and this would be easier if
  I had the actual font.  It is one that seems familiar to me, but I just can&#39;t
  think of the name of it.  Many thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37915.jpg"

  body: I doubt that this is font. The k seems to be designed as a final character,
    and wouldn&#39;t really fit in the middle of a word. Looks like custom lettering.
