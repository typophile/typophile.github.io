    body: Chicken Little was not even a close match for Stag Sans. I do think if you
      are in a jam Calibri will work unless you have the budget to actually purchase
      Stag Sans.

  body: Christoffer, I'm not aware of a similar webfont. Stag Sans has some very unique
    characteristics. If you remove those, you might arrive at something that resembles
    a Franklin Gothic or Trade Gothic (maybe). But, I'm not sure you'll find anything
    very close. I would contact Commercial Type and see if you can license it as a
    webfont.

  body: To me, it seems like using something like Trade Gothic for the light weights,
    and Antique Olive for the bold weights, would be vaguely similar.

  body: I know the x height isn't as big and it runs a bit condensed comparatively,
    but have you tried [[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/lucida-sans?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts#product_top|Lucida
    Sans]]?
