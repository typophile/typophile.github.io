body: I stumbled across this wonderful site the otherday and would liketo get you
  opinions on a logo I am working on. It&#39;s for an upcoming conference. I&#39;ve
  never really tried to design type before, but seemed to get a bug to do it for this
  design. Let me know what you think. <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6550.jpg"

  body: Ted, i like a lot the one in the right, allthough i think you have some characters
    too decorative, like your &#34;g&#34;, also I think your &#34;c&#34; and &#34;e&#34;
    are too closed, you should open them a little bit, and the &#34;n&#34;s are too
    wide, narrow them.  <BR> <BR>Be careful with the union betwen the circle and the
    vertical stem in your a, d and g, you should compensate the black thing that happends
    in the intersection <BR> <BR>Ah, and you should make all the letters narrower,
    in order to compensate them in an optical way and don

  body: I suggest keeping the very clever monogram from either <BR>option 2 or 3 and
    setting the rest of the type in something <BR>more readable and tame. You&#39;re
    making &#39;dce&#39; look great, <BR>don&#39;t overdo it. Avenir, Gotham or any
    of those geometric <BR>sans would go well with it.

  body: The middle option is by far the cleverest and also reads best.The horizontal
    use in the third option doesn&#39;t work so well, since the d and e stand out
    but the fish doesn&#39;t read as an o. <BR> <BR>I second Stephen&#39;s suggestion
    that you try this approach with an existing type &#40;modified for weight as necessary&#41;,
    but if you do decide to stick with your own letter design than Cristian is right
    in saying that your c and e need to be opened. <BR> <BR>Your n is too wide. <BR>
    <BR>For a good example of the kind of optical adjustment Cristian recommends for
    the a, d and g, see Futura.

  body: 'I like the idea of. Very nice. No.3 &#40;bottom&#41; is the strongest. Unless
    you can separate No.2 from the text, because I like the verticality of the mark.  I
    agree with typeface simplification as well. the &#39;s&#39; seems a little too
    clever as does the &#39;yi&#39; lig. And the apostrophe needs some tlc too. also,
    with No.3, I feel that it needs some space in between the mark and the text. I
    believe this would strengthen them and also relieve the redundancy of the letters.  <BR>
    <BR>All said. The concept in an of itself is very strong.                                                                                 '

  body: thanks for the feedback! <BR>i modified the horizontal version to help the
    &#39;o&#39; out a bit and pulled the vertical version off the type to try and
    get a sense of which would work better. What do you think? <BR> <BR>Im thinking
    that I might save the type I designed for further refinment as a learning experience.
    I am surprised at how much I enjoyed designing the letterforms but obviously I&#39;ve
    got alot to learn.  <BR>More on that later. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6581.jpg"

  body: 'I still like the vertical much more than the horizontal. It works in so many
    different ways: you have you initial letters of the conference name; you have
    fish; you have bubbles rising to the surface; you have a diver&#39;s mask and
    snorkel.'
