body: Hello, I was assigned to digitize a handdrawn grungy 3d-font, and it has been
  a nightmare ;&#41; <BR>So far, only capitals... and legebility isn&#39;t the best.
  But as I said, I only digitized and evened this thing out. Comments, suggestions?  <BR>

    where the shadows are scribbled in and so on, good idea? '

    is really rounded and mushy like dough that has risen. If you sharpened off one
    or both corners, it may add an element of inconsistency &#40;this is a good thing
    for this font&#41; <BR> <BR>Other letters that may benefit from some randum sharpening
    are the &#34;M&#34;, the &#34;N&#34; and the &#34;S&#34; <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

    same path, so I can&#39;t recommend that. Maybe Flash, if it can be automated.
    From what I&#39;ve heard about that new MX version, it might do the trick. And
    then there&#39;s Generator, but... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: You can still do some retty neat things with Flash... originally my pixel
    font pixelon existed solely within flash - I hard-coded each character and wrote
    a display algorithm before realizing that I could use a truetype font and it would
    be much faster. Also, the new drawing api in MX makes 3d rendering much easier,
    as you can now draw surfaces. As an example, check out <A HREF="http://www.become.co.uk/3d2.swf"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.become.co.uk/3d2.swf</A>. <BR>This can have applications
    in simple 3d text extrusion. <BR>MX rocks! &#40;at least, in terms of what you
    can do with it, not in terms of the layout which I personally feel stinks&#41;
