    is a Scandinavian version of this... Forsberg or Lindegren or somebody. This is
    a badly done redesign. Especially the caps.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "No pissing match here.\r\n\r\nAll I was saying Mike is that there is a smoother,
    more pristine, version of this somewhere out there. The caps are ill informed
    and the lower case is awkward. Yes it probably is Ad Hoc, but why not go for the
    original? I will get out the books tonight Mike, so check back in the a.m. It
    actually looks like Hannu Paalusma's work from Denmark.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    the question. I'm not saying it's the best pen lettering.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "No, definitely Ad Hoc... but a very poor rendition of a previously existing
    face! Look at the lower case o, no penman/designer in their right mind would have
    executed an interior bowl like that, just plain bad. That is why I said it was
    a rip.\r\n\r\nMichael"
