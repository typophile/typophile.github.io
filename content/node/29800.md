body: Does anyone know of any well designed Tag Lines for companies? I can't think
  of any off the top of my head, but i just got 1000 type treatments in today so I
  will peruse that. I am wondering if anyone has ever done an article on this. But
  let me know if you have any examples you like!

    because they are just named here and you can't see how they were used, but perhaps
    you can look from there to see how they designed the many different taglines..\r\n\r\ndav."
