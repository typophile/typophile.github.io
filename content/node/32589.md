body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nDue to the impending retirement of one of my colleages, Target
  Corporation in Minneapolis is looking for a full-time typesetter/typographer at
  corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nOur work is a combination
  of a significant amount of typography production for print advertising and the circular,
  as well as font purchasing, font management and font manipulation for the corporation
  and its vendors. \r\n\r\nCandidates should have a good eye for typesetting, a borderline
  OCD-like obsession with detail and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment
  with minimal supervision. \r\n\r\nIf you or someone you know is interested in more
  information about this opening, feel free to contact me directly at kristin.dooley
  (add the little squiggle here) target.com.\r\n\r\nFeel free to pass the word!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n"
