  body: Could be a custom designed logo. Makes sense for a computer game. Most of
    these logos are.

  body: "I'd actually believe it was a freeware font before I'd believe it to be custom.
    Most of the games designed back in the day used a lot of freeware fonts both from
    their package designs and also for in game type (the licensing would have been
    insane, especially for an up and coming game design company like Rockstar.)\r\n\r\nCheck
    the popular freeware/shareware font sites, like Dafont. I wouldn't be surprised
    if you found it there."

  body: Already checked Dafont, couldn't find it. [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=1394|Force
    Majeure]] is the only one that kind of looked like it, but especially the T and
    R are way off.

    when I get home.

    might elicit a better response.
