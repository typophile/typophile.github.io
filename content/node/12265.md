body: "While prowling in the new Typowiki (sure to be another excellent procrastination
  tool), I noted that there was a hesitant 'Alphabets' index that linked to a small
  number of writing systems, only some of which were actually alphabets. So I took
  it upon myself to retitle this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Writing%20Systems\">Writing
  Systems</a>, and to add under this general heading Abjads, Abugidas, and Alphabets,
  each of which I've populated with as exhaustive a list as I can come up with, largely
  thanks to the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/\">Omniglot</a>. Later
  I will add other classifications of writing systems under the general heading, unless
  someone beats me to it. In the meantime, I encourage people to start populating
  the wiki nodes for individual writing systems.\r\n\r\nObviously, this represents
  quite a lot of work, so if you have bright ideas for changes to the overall arrangement
  of the Writing Systems indices, perhaps you could contact me and we can discuss
  them -- or post them here --, rather than just going and making wholesale changes
  to what I've done. Wikis still unnerve me somewhat: where's the editor? no editor?
  what do you mean there's no editor?"

  body: "I take it Katakana and Hiragana would go under Syllabaries, another top-level
    writing system? It looks like the omniglot people know what they're talking about,
    but I'm still not completely sure that the categories are the Absolute Truth.
    Typographically, Hangul is composed of syllables, while Devanagari is essentially
    alphabetic, which strongly suggests that their classification is all about the
    implicit vowels. Wait a minute, what this \"vowel\" thing? All I see are pretty
    shapes :)\r\n\r\nThe typowiki is obviously going to be one of the coolest, most
    rocking wikis around. The combination of lots of flow through tight integration
    with the rest of the site, a high concentration of actual experts, and a respectful
    community is dynamite.\r\n\r\nWhere should I post my wishlist for the wiki? On
    the forum, or perhaps on another wiki node, as is often done in purist wiki sites?
    An item high on the list is to indicate wiki links by color, rather than the cute
    but distracting superscript W."

  body: "Yes, I will be adding Syllabaries as another top level index.\r\n\r\nA pure
    alphabet has distinct symbols (letters) for consonants and vowels, both of which
    are <em>always</em> written in full.* So Devanagari and the other Brahmic-derived
    scripts are not 'essentially alphabetic' in a pure sense, because the inherent
    vowel is presumed. That is the defining feature of an abugida. Hangul, on the
    other hand, although it is written in a way that composes letters (jamo) into
    syllabic blocks, is an alphabet and not a syllabary, because it is the jamo that
    are the basic building blocks of the script, not the syllables. One could write
    Hangul sequentially using jamo, like the Latin alphabet. if one were inclined
    to; native readers would find it very odd, of course, but the writing system permits
    this because it is fundamentally alphabetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n* This leads to some confusion
    in the classification of some scripts. Arabic and Hebrew are classified as abjads,
    i.e. cosonantal alphabets in which the writing of vowels is optional, because
    this is what they are when used to write the Arabic and Hebrew languages. But
    the Arabic script used to write Kurdish is an alphabet, as is Hebrew used to write
    Yiddish. Also, even for writing Hebrew, these is some limitation on the optionality
    of vowels, as the letter vav may be either a consonant or a vowel (holam male),
    and is always written even when a vowel."

    readers of Hangul than makers of Hangul fonts, a script should first serve its
    users, and [adult] readers read the \"blocks\" as whole syllables*; so if I had
    to choose, I'd list it as a syllabary (with a proper elaboration on its alphabetic
    aspect).\r\n\r\n* It's their boumas.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    which has been experimented and used since 1914. There are on-going debates and
    discussions of its use among the interests. Its research and applications have
    been usually for machine writing, but the idea and its actual use can be found
    in some extreme examples of Non-Tetragonal type of fonts. These days, the Segmented
    Writing is pervasive in logo types and commercial graphic design work. It is so
    popular that it became sort of a clich\xE9.\r\n\r\nYes, defining Hangul either
    as an alphabet or a syllabary is in every ways very fuzzy.\r\n\r\nSeonil"
