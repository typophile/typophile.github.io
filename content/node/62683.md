  there are mistakes to correct but have a look an feel free to comment in any way
  you wish. All feedback will be gratefully received. I am under no illusions that
  this is finished stuff. But I learned a great deal doing it which is deeply pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe
  ROP document (reflections on practice) will join soon."

    I love the text of your specimen.\r\nI haven\u2019t seen a more original use of
    OT features in a long time.\r\nIt emulates everything that makes metal type readable
    while\r\nstill feeling fresh and relevant for contemporary work. Amazing.\r\nNow
    I see where all that research from the last couple of years was going!"

    be "Tabular oldstyle".

  body: "I was at Barnes & Noble today looking through a slew of new novels and trying
    to identify the typeface. What I noticed more than anything was how light so many
    of them were. Even if the printing was good, the typeface itself carried so many
    wiry and bony characteristics that I had to put the books down.\r\n\r\nA typeface
    shouldn't perfume the page with its wispy teasing; it should land on it like a
    large black hammer, all G\xF6tzen-D\xE4mmerung-like and stuff, or How To Design
    Type with a Hammer.\r\n\r\nYou had me at: \"Perhaps a new type should be a bit
    heavier than other book types.\" Yes, heavier, weighted, workhorse. I have never
    seen italics like that! They look almost knitted and handmade. I need to slow
    my eyes down and study those.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, Eben! Looking forward to
    you nursing/releasing this baby into the wild.\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

  body: "Thanks! I am looking forward to doing more with them as well as spending
    the time to weed out the ones that don't contribute enough to be worth leaving
    in. I am working on a way of looking at them that is more concerned with supporting
    glyph recognition than evenness for its sake. ( these two things are not opposed
    per se ). This comes out of reading Pelli and others on the subject of crowding
    and doing an reading speed experiment here at Reading.\r\n"
