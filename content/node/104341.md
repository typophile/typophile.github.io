  find anything indicating Whitney <strong>includes</strong> polytonic Greek. Usually
  that means no, does anyone know for sure?

  body: "Nick, I don't get to pick the typeface on this one. For good or ill, the
    client has specified Skolar for the text, with Whitney display. I don't have the
    MS in hand yet. If there is polytonic Greek in the display, we'll have to figure
    something out. Oh well, that's what comps are for. Get the accents/breath marks
    from a different font, & place by hand... very slowly...\r\n\r\nHrant:\r\n\r\nMaybe.
    It's hard to figure out from all their advertising, but so far, it seems so. I
    take\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In preparation for moving its library into OpenType, H&FJ
    established the Language Research Program in 2005, in order to develop updated
    specifications for its Latin-based character sets. The initial product of this
    research is H&FJ\u2019s Latin-X\u2122 character set, which expands the reach of
    a typeface to an additional 200,000,000 readers worldwide. This character set
    reflects not only a more accurate awareness of the political landscape of language,
    but the most up-to-date understanding of cultural norms.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nto
    be an attempt to put a positive spin on the fact they aren't offering OpenType
    fonts yet. Just look at the pricing for \"Basic\" & how much more adding the small
    caps is (and as a separate set of fonts, which means even more more handwork for
    use). The \"multiscprit\" fonts cost more than twice the \"basic,\" a pricing
    I find predatory. Of course, I'm a curmudgeon...\r\n\r\nI've always taken H&FJ
    to be in the advertising world, one which has rare overlap with books. Their pricing
    models seem to fit that, too. But again, I'm a curmudgeon..."

    but they certainly are now. I can't comment on their Greek support.

    *Manuscript* bundle for $600? As opposed from the *Advanced* for $300 and the
    *Pro* for $500? (For <strong>one</strong> computer.) These are current offerings.
    It looks like, except perhaps for manuscript,  the more expensive bundles -- which
    do add glyphs -- also add to the number of fonts in the bundle, which I take to
    mean the extra glyphs are in separate fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/styles/"
