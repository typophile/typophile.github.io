  hangul (Korean alphabet) typeface in the foreseeable future, I started sketching
  out an idea for a hangul typeface that I had been carrying around in my head.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hangaram_4476.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
  just drawing around a dozen test glyphs. At this point, I'm most concerned with
  getting the basic proportions right. It's too early to fine-tune the stroke widths
  in the individual glyphs.\r\n\r\nThis would be a low-contrast serif text face, quite
  a bit darker than the text faces usually seen in Korean books. The biggest departure
  from the usual hangul faces of this genre is that for the moment I'm planning to
  do away with the 'serifs' on the \u3147 (the circular letter) completely. The glyphs
  are on the narrow side, with simplified and open forms intended to make it work
  for smaller point sizes. I've tried two different approaches for the \uC624: the
  first where the \u3147 and the \u3157 are connected and the connection vastly simplified,
  and the second where they are kept separate.\r\n\r\nI've no idea where I'll go from
  here, but it's fun designing hangul and I wanted to share."

  body: "I know nothing about hangul script, but just looking at it as glyph design
    it feels to me like there's an inconsistency between the circular part and the
    other strokes. The others have a brush feel, and the circle does not. \r\n\r\nI
    just looked at the Wikipedia article on hangul, and I see that the circle comes
    from cursive where as the rest comes from the straight Chinese brush style. So
    I guess its an inherent problem getting it to look right. I see in the article
    that some of the circles are a longer ellipse, which looks more harmonious in
    the illustration in the article. \r\n\r\nI guess my feeling is that if the straight
    strokes look brushed--and they look lovely--then the circle should have more of
    that look for consistency of look.  "

  body: "Thanks for the comments, William. The circular letter \u3147 is indeed problematic.
    Most of today's hangul text faces add a tiny entry stroke to the \u3147, as in
    the sample of Batang below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ieung_4019.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
    solution isn't satisfactory for me because of the problems it causes in small
    sizes distinguishing between such pairs as \uD765 and \uD6D9, as shown above.
    Also, I would prefer my typeface to be extended to cover obsolete letters, among
    them \u3181, which is a \u3147 with a small vertical stroke on top. A \u3147 with
    an entry stroke would be too easily confused with \u3181.\r\n\r\nThe entry stroke
    on the \u3147 must be a recent innovation, because I don't recall seeing a pre-20th-century
    hangul typeface having this feature. The following is from <em>Oryun Haengsildo</em>
    ('Illustrated Acts of the Five Relationships') of 1797, and shows \u3147 without
    any entry strokes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oryun_4086.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    think it may have been the type designer Choe Jeongho who popularized if not invented
    the entry stroke on the \u3147, presumably to make it look like it was written
    with a brush so that it would harmonize better with the other letters. Ironically,
    when actually writing hangul with a brush, this entry stroke appears only in some
    really cursive styles.\r\n\r\nI'll have to find a way to harmonize the \u3147
    with the other letters without adding an entry stroke, perhaps by making the shape
    slightly more irregular. Perhaps I can do something with the counter shape to
    suggest the movement of a brush. Making the circles a longer ellipse, while widely
    applied on sans-serif designs, isn't really appropriate for this style, though."

  body: "I think you're right that the entry stroke does not make it consistent. I
    see the straight strokes are brushed top to bottom, left to right, so perhaps
    the circle can reflect that. \r\n\r\nGiving it some kind of asymmetry and molding
    may work. Also it's very tricky getting the weights of everything just right.
    This is one of the big issues in Roman type also--getting the round and straight
    strokes to play with each other happily.   "

  body: "Do you think breaking the strict left-right symmetry and going for an oblique
    stress may be a step in the right direction? Excuse the rough curves, but here's
    a quick sketch, with the old shapes for comparison on the right. I've never seen
    this oblique stress in a hangul text face, but in a way it recalls how the circular
    letter is formed when writing with a brush\u2014by making two crescent-shaped
    strokes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hano_4943.gif]"

  body: "Yes, to my eyes, the one on the left is much better. I think it needs some
    more massaging, but yeah, that's it. That's what I was thinking of: the o shape
    should reflect the assymetry of the top down and left to right brush strokes.
    \r\n\r\nIf it hasn't been done before, then I think you've really got an improvement.
    You might try experimenting with a brush, to get ideas, though the final form
    you'll probably end up not being strictly by the brush. \r\n\r\nOf course, I'm
    looking at it with eyes accustomed to looking at latin type, so you'd need to
    see how those accustomed to reading Hangul script react, once you're happy with
    it. "

  body: "I like the one on the left as well, once you ignore the uneven curves. I
    should probably see it in print to judge it properly, but on screen at least the
    oblique stress holds up surprisingly well. \r\n\r\nAs to why this hasn't been
    tried before, I'm not sure but I can guess that it's because it doesn't work well
    with the entry stroke.\r\n\r\n<cite>You might try experimenting with a brush,

    a decade! But yeah, it's a good idea to experiment with different forms that way.
    The \u3147 comes to resemble an almost triangular shape in some writing styles,
    although that would be too distracting for a contemporary text face."

  body: "Hello, Jongseong.\r\n\r\nI came across this post while I was searching for
    a way to replace the ugly Korean system fonts installed by default in the Ubuntu
    Linux distribution, and found the discussions of Korean typeface on the forum
    very fascinating.\r\n\r\nI'm a fairly proficient non-native Korean speaker, and
    when I write a \u3147 (with a ball-point pen), not only is the stress obliquely
    centered on the upper right and lower left as you showed in your second illustration,
    but the ellipse itself is oriented obliquely.  I think the obliqueness of the
    stressed portions of your \u3147 show its connection to a brush style, and I definitely
    agree with your decision to remove the top entry stroke, for the reasons that
    you pointed out above.\r\n\r\nHave you done any more tinkering with this typeface
    since your last post?  I'm interested in seeing more."

  body: "Thanks Jeff, for that post. Sorry I didn't see it until now.\r\n\r\nI think
    in most examples of proficient handwriting (at least of the older generation),
    the \u3147 becomes an oblique ellipse as you described. Also, horizontal strokes
    will tend to slant upwards. This reflects writing speed. A text typeface will
    need to have a more static form, but just a touch of the obliqueness may make
    the design more lively.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you agree with dropping the top entry
    stroke. It's a pretty radical decision, so I would like to hear what people think
    about it.\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine, designing a Korean typeface is a time-consuming
    process. As I am a beginner, I'll have to figure everything out from scratch.\r\n\r\nI
    posted some proofs from a couple of weeks after my original post here in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/57311\">this
    blog post</a>. It has been worked on since, but most of the work has been on setting
    up scripts to generate variations of the different consonants and vowels to be
    composed into the syllables. It's programming work \r\nmostly; not much I can
    show at this point.\r\n\r\nI'm juggling a number of different, mostly non-Korean
    original typeface designs in my spare time, so I'm afraid progress will be very
    slow.\r\n"
