body: A friend wants to get &#34;ROMANCE&#34; tattooed across the palm  <BR>of his
  hand. We started digging through specimen books  <BR>wondering what sort of serif
  would best hold up over time. <BR>Old tattoos do this strange sort of shift. It&#39;s
  not exactly like <BR>ink bleed nor loosing focus, but somewhere in the middle.  <BR>So
  how do we compensate? Designers have dealt with  <BR>cheap newspaper printing and
  type for the screen, are any  <BR>of those techniques applicable for aging skin?
  Ink traps  <BR>were discussed to prevent too much bleeding. Sharp latin  <BR>serifs
  could eventually erode into something like a soft  <BR>transitional bracket? Has
  anyone had any experience with  <BR>this? Or know people whose tattoos remain legible?

  body: I learned a long time ago, as a designer, never to get a tattoo...I will never
    be happy with it. Is it straight, is the kerning off, are the serifs equal...
    really... I suggest the same to you. LOL  <BR> <BR>Plus you will always want to
    change it, modify it, or worse, add to it...

  body: Robb, <BR> <BR>It seems to me that the location of the tattoo would guide
    in type choice as well. Traps for cheap paper is one thing, but what about the
    way the hand wrinkles? Seems to me that a sans would be the safest bet, or maybe
    a semi might be interesting. Another thought could be that it isn&#39;t the new
    tattoo that is considered but the journey it will be on.  <BR> <BR>Interesting
    location too. <a href="http://www.westcoastchoppers.com/low.php" target="_blank">Jesse
    James</a> has a tattoo on his hand that says &#34;Pay up sucker&#34; in a script.

    I&#39;d go with a slab like <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_064.html">Clarendon</a>
    or the like. The thicker forms may dampen the effect. From what I&#39;ve seen
    of traditional tattoo lettering, it tends to be thick stems and thin, monoline
    serifs; a kind of deviant, curvier Bodoni. Not sure if that&#39;s a stylistic
    or practical thing, but you might want to consider it.'

  body: 'I&#39;ve already yelled at him for wanting &#40;in my opinion&#41; a regrettable
    tattoo, but he has his heart set on getting &#34;jobkillers.&#34; He also has
    a printer&#39;s mark fleuron inside his lower lip. after I got over the initial
    shock, the legibility question seemed interesting from a print production perspective.  <BR>
    <BR>The stylized moderns are classic probably because tattoo pioneers drew that
    way--more style than utility. Just a guess considering most of those thins turn
    murky in a few years. Yet people still get them. <BR> <BR>Tiffany: there was an
    interview with Jesse James in Fast Company, FSB, or Inc &#40;one of the business-lite
    mags&#41; that had a gorgeous gritty photo of that PAY UP SUCKA. A poor quality
    one here: <BR><a href="http://clantongang.com/oldwest/tgplb0313a.jpg" target="_blank">http://clantongang.com/oldwest/tgplb0313a.jpg</a>
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll suggest the Clarendons to him.'
