  RESTROOMS and they specialize in clean, spacious and pleasantly smelling portable
  toilets for weddings and corporate events. The logo should appeal to women as the
  bathrooms are mostly for them (hey guys can go anywhere). I'm rebranding them and
  would love some feedback as I'll be presenting the client in a couple of days. I've
  included 2 of my directions below. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nMy key words for the

    against the word town, and a different color.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the word restrooms
    should be smaller and a very, very simple font, as you already have two different
    fonts. Maybe a small serif?"

  body: "Woman here :)\r\nMy initial reaction was that the second one is trying too
    hard to be classy. And old-style: I personally always find it a bit humorous if
    establishments try to look like they've been around forever, use a font reminiscent
    of 2 centuries ago, & even put the \"since whenever\" line in their logo &ndash;
    and then they've been around for what, 3 years? Seriously.\r\n\r\nThat said, I
    think the first one has good potential. It looks a bit more unusual but pleasantly
    surprising/surprised, especially with that Baskervillian high \"p\" &ndash; so
    nicely matching a client's reaction upon visiting/using a portable toilet that's
    actually nice :-). \"Fresh\" is a good adjective.\r\nHell, you might even try
    a heavy sans for the TOWN part. Or maybe not.\r\nMost of all, I'm not sure about
    the \"restrooms\" either. It's too close to the \"up\" but not quite the same.
    I might try a wide-ish sans (think Gotham, or maybe something more classicist)
    in tracked-out all caps, not too large, not too heavy. "

  body: "Thanks you all for your input. The challenge for me is making the logo \"feminine\"
    without excluding the masculine completely (if that makes any sense).\r\n\r\naltaira\u2013thanks
    for your comments regarding the \"Filosifia\" direction. I've had moments when
    I've found it's classic look appropriate and others where I've question it completely.
    I think you put words to my negative gut feelings.\r\n\r\nHere's some revisions
    based on your comments. I'm not satisfied with it the way the u and the p are
    disconnected but look as though they should be connected. As a purist, modifying
    it to allow them to connect is painful. Any suggestions on how to resolve that
    issue? Is it even an issue?\r\n\r\nI'm also showing another variation of the same
    logo just because I think it might also work. Once again, thanks for your time

    a side note\u2013do you guys when normally present the client 1 logo direction
    or do you provide 2 and let them choose a direction they like? Also do you present
    the logo(s) with color studies and applications (call card) all at once or do
    you show the logo then go back to do color study and applications after they've
    picked a direction?\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks in advance for any and all input
