body: I'm in the ridiculous situation of having marked a type in a design I'm working
  on with "Trade Gothic," but now I look at it and I can't locate what version of
  Trade Gothic it would be. My sample is narrower than any Trade Gothic I see out
  there. Can anyone help me?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile-identity_6360.png]
