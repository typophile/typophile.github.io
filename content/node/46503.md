  calling the project Use less Toledo, but we are trying to play on the word useless.
  I was just wondering what you all would have to say. \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!"

  body: Its because of the stereotype of Toledo, the project is showing Toledo how
    to be "green"

  body: I understand the green part. I'm saying 'useless' is a rather dangerous word
    to be playing off of. If Toledo is worthless, why bother greening it?

  body: "The concept is broken.  Ergo, any logo inspired by it is useless.  Nice attempt
    at cleverness, but overall the word \"useless\" has too much negative attached
    to it to be useful.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Just a thought, if you are hell bent on this phrasing:\r\n\r\nCould you not
    set USE and TOLEDO in caps and the \"less\" in lower case, possibly italicized.
    And just maybe drop the baseline of the less to give it a bit of separation from
    the rest. Not much, just a tad.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "I like the \"useless\" connotations. If you saw a sign that said \"Useless
    <your city>\" you would probably stop and look. I saw a similar campaign around
    my city last year called \"FLICK OFF\" (the LI combination was kerned just a little
    too tightly) and it made you do a double take.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the 'ul'
    mark you've come up with doesn't work. I would like to see a mark that really
    says \"use less\" of whatever you're trying to get Toledo to use less of. That
    way the initial shock of having your city called \"useless\" is immediately replaced
    by the notion of using less.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "i like the \"use less toledo\" name... perhaps a color change (like for the
    word \"less\") would make it a tad more clear. or maybe the 3 words stacked on
    top of each other... \r\neither way, i think since it is for a design workshop,
    it wont be too hard for the target audience to figure out. "
