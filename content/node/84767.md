body: "I'm trying to design a logo for myself because I'm beginning to get some leads
  for some web design and tech support jobs for some local businesses and I want to
  develop an identity and deploy my own web page (I know ... trying to start a design/tech
  support business on the side and I don't even have my own website. Let's just chalk
  it up to living a contradiction and leave it at that, OK?)\r\n\r\nPlease be as honest
  as possible with your critiques, keeping these things in mind:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Currently,
  I have $0 to hire a professional (maybe in the future when I bring in some more
  cash).\r\n<li>This is a learning process for me, however; an exercise in becoming
  self-taught.\r\n<li>I know enough to know what's REALLY bad, but not enough to know
  what's really good, much less for a mark for my own business (I've seen more talented/professional
  designers than myself struggle with this kind of project\u2014if you'll grant me
  the title of designer).\r\n<li>The design is preliminary, but the one I liked the
  best based on a couple of pages of brainstorming with pencil and paper.\r\n<li>I
  haven't kerned the type or payed a terrible amount of attention to the space between
  the type and logo.\r\n<li>I've fiddled with the stroke width on the logo, but realize
  that it could use some more refinement/tweaking.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe idea I'm going
  with here is modern/tech-oriented monogram. I've attached large and small examples
  so you can see how it scales, as well as two different ideas for orientation between
  the type and logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nickhladeklogo-largestacked_4187.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nickhladeklogo-largeangle_5165.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nickhladeklogo-smallstacked_3905.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nickhladeklogo-smallangle_6281.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your input, feedback, advice, cheers, jeers, etc.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nNick

  body: When I look at your personal logo I think of two things, Nike and Gatorade.
    Perhaps remove the giant N?

  body: "To me that big N is a bit clunky and industrial, not hi-tech. Also, something
    looks a bit wrong with the D in your surname. Is it from a font you've manipulated
    slightly?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see your original sketches too. "

  body: "Nik, before you get stuck in the typography, think about the message. You
    have one good thing going for you, a unique name. If you are starting out wearing
    more than one hat, build a generic brand that you can change or attach a generic
    tagline to e.g. webhead. You can explain on your business card or website more
    about what you do, the key here is to make your presence known and define the
    industry you work in - as you are obviously a jack of all trades.\r\n\r\nWhen
    starting out you want to get attention or at least be memorable. I agree with
    the others the big N is a waste of time and takes the focus off your name. "

  body: Among the other things mentioned above, the condensed gothic style typeface
    doesn't really speak to me on behalf of someone who works in technology. It could
    probably work if you had an overall retro thing going on, like a modernized revival
    of an old 1940's radio repair company. But in this case I would try to go with
    a more refined looking typeface.
