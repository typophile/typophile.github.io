body: I have just started a new job at a university designing for the art and architecture
  departments. the art and architecture departments want me to make something very
  cutting edge, but  the graphic standards of the university are very stringent...i
  can only use akzidenz and melior. akzidenz i can deal with, but i am not particularly
  crazy about melior especially because it only has two weights. would i be legally
  able to create additional weights based on the medium and bold or should i just
  grit my teeth and bear it?

    directly, license information in hand, and ask them to modify it for you.

  body: "This is a little concerning to me, as I have recently (and innocently) outlined
    Franklin Gothic and tugged at the vector anchors to create an altered version
    of it. I am with an in-house art department, and we have recently printed a relatively
    small run of bumper stickers and buttons using the letterforms I (sort of) created.
    Am I about to get in big trouble? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\r\n\r\nIs
    there a law against using a typeface as a model for letters I wish to create?\r\n\r\nIs
    it really illegal if I'm not selling it or claiming that it's 100% my own creation?\r\n\r\nI'm
    hoping that at the very most somebody is going to slap my hand and tell me not
    to do it again.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OVspf_bttn_ILikeMilk08_6555.png]"

  body: "Koppa, did you alter all the glyphs or just the ones you needed? The original
    poster needs/wants a whole new weight of an existing face and be able to use it
    as a font in any program.\r\n\r\nWhat you did was change the letters into outlines
    and use them as art, sort of like customizing a letter for use in a logotype.
    Most EULAs account for that type of use. The graphic design is 100% your own creation,
    but I would mention in your portfolio that your lettering is \"customized Franklin
    Gothic\" or something of that sort. Give credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: 'Adnix is right, Koppa. Taking a few letters in Illustrator and then tweaking
    them is not (usually) a problem. Creating a new typeface is the problem in this
    instance. There are foundries, such as Adobe, which allow modification for internal
    use. '

  body: Melior is available from Adobe, and they allow modifications, so if you can
    get a license from them, you should be okay.

    yourself (reassuring them that the new fonts will not leave your hard disk). Tell
    them that you will be forced to use another font if you can't have a demi of Melior
    in 3 days. Tell them that if they can't do it that fast and they don't give you
    their blessings, oh my, you don't know <em>whatever</em> shall you do...\r\n\r\nAll
    this however assumes that you can do the job well. While in Boston in April I
    witnessed a font utterly butchered by a designer doing high-profile work for MIT;
    I found the guy and told him to please stop.\r\n\r\n> Melior is available from
    Adobe, and they allow modifications\r\n\r\nAh! As far as you know your Melior
    is now from Adobe...\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is how reasonable people deal with
    unreasonable EULAs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
