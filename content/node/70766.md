  this typeface is...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hart_4765.jpg]\r\nIt's
  the David Hart & Co. logo type found on www.davidhartnyc.com\r\n\r\nAt first glimpse
  i thought it was a Bondoni Condensed variant but apparently not. If anyone is able
  to shine some light on the matter, it would be appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\nfrom
  Chris."
