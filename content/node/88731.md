  Packers use for some promotional items. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/404916_10150469633275073_71671905072_8935558_1780370767_n.jpg\"
  />\r\n\r\nI also included another file for further clarification.\r\n\r\nHere's
  what I've got so far... Dispatch is pretty darn close. I'm assuming it's a custom
  version of Dispatch? Look at the E and C, they are both different, while most other
  glyphs are spot on. The C is critical for my researching purposes, that's the only
  reason why I'm not going to purchase Dispatch. I don't like how hard the counter-form
  is. \r\n\r\nI might have to just customize it myself for this project but it would
  be nice to have a typeface to use where I don't have to alter characters. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!"
