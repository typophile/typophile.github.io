  2008 cover?\r\nGo to \r\nwww.flaunt.com\r\nfor an example.  \r\n\r\nOr on the Burton
  Snowboards \"Its Always Snowing Somewhere\" 2008 DVD Cover?\r\nGo to \r\nhttp://www.snowboard-revolution.com/news/Its-Always-Snowing-Somewhere-Aussie-Premiere.html\r\nfor
  an example.\r\n\r\nThey are kind of retro/techno style fonts I think.  I'm new to
  this so don't laugh...\r\n\r\n"

    but the logo is probably custom made for "Flaunt" and not a typeface.'
