  used in this title. I've seen these characters elsewhere , but nothing current.
  They've all been old print ads , and of course , the video title.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  recognize this? I'm assuming it hasn't been digitized , but any information you
  could give is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bsss_300_title_resize_6685.jpg]"

  body: It's an old Letraset face called Tankard, but I don't think it's been digitized.
    The offset shadow effect was part of the design.

  body: "Thank you so much for helping with the name of this typeface! No wonder I
    haven't been able to find it , and I've literally searched some of the larger
    font sites a few times over in my quest. You've been a tremendous help though
    , and I do thank you again.\r\n\r\nLet me ask one more question if you please.
    Is there any way , website or print , to view all the characters in this set?
    I'm quite curious how the other letters appear. \r\n\r\nThanks again and cheers!"

    is the complete character set, apparently. The sample is from the 1997-98 Letraset
    catalog. No designer credit, just \xA9 1983 Esselte Letraset Ltd."

  body: It's pretty much in the hands of Monotype, which owns the rights to all the
    Letraset fonts. I wouldn't hold my breath. There are lots of classic ITC faces
    (which they own the rights to as well) that they've never released digitally.
    They are sitting on some real gems, if you ask me.

  body: "Greetings once again, and looking to revisit an old inquiry. \r\n\r\nHaving
    given up on finding the Tankard font as mentioned above, since it was believed
    to have not been digitized, I was wondering if after a few years something might
    have changed for the positive in this quest.\r\n\r\nWhy I'm asking is, I recently
    stumbled across a new logo using the Tankard font, and I'm hopeful this might
    actually be available to download now... from somewhere at least(crosses fingers).
    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4677.png]\r\n\r\nIs there any
    new information that might confirm the availability for purchase. \r\n\r\nThanking
    you in advance.\r\n"
