  body: "I had feared this would mean the non-pro free version of FontExplorerX would
    no longer be available with this announcement, but, for the time being, it is
    still here:\r\n[[http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX?]]\r\n\r\nI do hope the
    free version remains available and continues to be maintained.\r\n\r\nWhat are
    the significant feature distinctions between the free and Pro versions?"

    they know this and I'm glad they continue to develop it.\r\n\r\nMinor quibbles:\r\nToo
    bad the name is getting so long. \r\nWhy no screenshots of the new UI on the website?"

    so far. It's a pretty exciting development and I look forward to trying it soon.

  body: I'm having trouble getting pricing. I know someone mentioned the Pro version
    being $39, but what about the server? I need this info to get my office to buy
    it :)
