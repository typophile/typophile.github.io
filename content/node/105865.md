body: "I have a copy of CS3 Design premium and put it up on Craigslist. This guy almost
  immediately contacts me with his number and wants to buy it. Then I see the same
  phone number on another post offering to buy all these software programs. What's
  his deal? Why would he want to buy all this software? Am I missing an opportunity
  for more cash? Is he bootlegging it? Anyone have an idea?\r\n\r\nhttp://sfbay.craigslist.org/scz/wan/4008031709.html"

  body: "CS3 -- antique value?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the buyer is counting on people not
    to realize they <em>do not get an upgrade discount</em> from Adobe for this old
    version, and so they are duped into thinking they made a good deal towards purchasing
    CC."

  body: There are a lot of people who don't want to go to the Cloud. And there is
    a lot of layout work that doesn't require anything more than CS3. And the bugs
    are known, & there are probably fewer of them. In other words, it could be a legitimate
    notion of how to make some money, as well as an illegitimate one.

  body: "That's a possibility... I wonder if he's shipping these copies out to other
    countries?\r\n\r\nI was using CS3 only until recently."

  body: "Another reason some folks use old software is they are using old computers
    which can't run newer software.  \r\n\r\nSometimes they're using old computers
    for financial reasons, and sometimes because there's a particular application
    they depend on which has been discontinued and won't run on modern systems. "

  body: The absolutely most stable platform I ever used was Windows NT. I'd use it
    & watch my wife's Mac crash & crash, but NT just kept plugging along. I'd use
    it today if the software would work & if it would take the needed memory with
    all the new stuff. Sadly, Microsoft never got one as stable again...

  body: "> watch my wife's Mac crash & crash\r\n\r\nThe early Macs did that a lot,
    I often got daily crashes. It got much better with OS-X (10). I'll have applications
    freeze occasionally (mostly Adobe stuff) but rarely have system crashes.\r\n"
