  an ellipssis (\u2026) or if it is just a mater of taste. I general follow these
  two rules (rightly or wrongly):\r\n\r\n1. If the ellipsis falls at the start or
  end of a sentence then I do not separate the ellipsis with a space.\r\n\r\ne.g.
  \u201CUp to 50% off\u2026\u201D\r\ne.g. \u201C\u2026this week only.\u201D\r\n\r\n2.
  If the ellipsis indicates omitted text within the middle of a sentence then I add
  a space either side.\r\n\r\ne.g. \u201CI have no idea if this is correct \u2026
  I wish I knew the answer\u201D \r\n\r\nAny help?"

  body: "The convention in ye olden days before desktop publishing was that you put
    a space before and after ellipses and em dashes, on the assumption that \u2014
    when line breaks occurred deep inside the guts of the phototypesetting machine
    \u2014 the spaces would allow for better line breaks. With the advent of WYSIWYG,
    the spaces are probably not necessary UNLESS, for some reason, at a later date
    you need to reflow the text and don't feel like going back and checking every
    freaking ellipsis or em dash in your copy..."

  body: "I\u2019m not as strong as I should be on the rules, but I always use an ellipsis
    with no space if some f\u2026 cut me off mid-sentence (or mid-word for that f\u2026ing
    matter) and when ever I\u2019m pondering or holding a thought I just go like this
    \u2026"

  body: "This subject is timely for me as I just finished a large job in which the
    client didn't like the style of ellipsis I used (I used the font's ellipsis character
    with a thin space on either side) and she asked me to go back and change them
    all to a different style.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I'd never given a lot of thought
    to this subject, so I spent a few minutes doing some research and was surprised
    to find some disagreements over ellipsis style.\r\n\r\nSo if there is a generally-agreed-upon
    \"proper\" style, I'd like to know it.\r\n\r\n> at a later date you need to reflow
    the text\r\n\r\nDon't know what program you're using, but if its InDesign you
    can apply the \"no break\" attribute to the ellipsis and the word before it, and
    that will keep them together even if the text reflows. A similar technique can
    be used to keep phone numbers, URLs, etc. from breaking.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Like Frode said: no word-space if it stands for omitted characters or parts
    of a word like in \u201Cf\u2026 rules\u201D\r\nbut space before and after if the
    ellipsis replaces whole words or part of sentences like here \u2026 or to leave
    things open in the end \u2026\r\n\r\nYour examples would be set like this:\r\n\u201CUp
    to 50% off \u2026\u201D\r\n\u201C\u2026 this week only\u201D"
