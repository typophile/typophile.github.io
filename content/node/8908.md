body: 'i was asked to make a logo for a sort of productionhouse called dp productions,
  they do audio, video and multimedia. This is what i got so far: <BR> <BR><a href="http://users.pandora.be/vegasrock/dplogo.html"
  target="_blank">http://users.pandora.be/vegasrock/dplogo.html</a> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  not happy with the results, one it feels more like a postal service logo or something
  <BR>second, the font for the letters.'

    target="_blank">http://users.pandora.be/vegasrock/dp01.gif</a> <BR>you could try
    to spin the dp mark up, <BR>or use it like the s, but take care with <BR>the Arial,
    it could end up looking Fascist !  lol <BR> <BR>Ciao, <BR>AS'

  body: the mark makes a lot of sense - for a production house.  print the mark out
    and draw over the top of it all the ways you could make the d and p connect.  I
    am seeing vhs, reel to reel, 35mm film from above...lots to go on here - i think
    the wordmark below is way too small compared to the large size of the logo. also
    I would try some variations with the typeface on the wordmark.  Does it have to
    be sanserif?  could you add something if dp was sans and productions was serif?
    <BR> <BR>good luck.

  body: Kenny, <BR> <BR>I like the latest logo version, but would like to suggest
    a few tiny modifications...  <BR> <BR>1&#41; Try to smooth the ending strokes
    of the big &#34;d&#34; and &#34;p&#34;. This would make it more into a symbol,
    but still crisp clear and readable letters. As it is now these strokes distract
    my eyes a bit. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Skip &#34;dp&#34; on the bottom line and increase
    &#34;productions&#34; to harmonize size-wise with the symbol above. <BR> <BR>Cheers/SH
