    Milano Roman</a>. I think it\u2019s not available in digital form."

    5 and 6 CD's. I have the font; if you just need some type set in it, I could do
    it for you.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    person. Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful offer.\r\n\r\nI think I'm
    going to hunt around and see if I can purchase those CDs somewhere. I bet there
    are some other lovely treasures to be discovered upon a closer look. Failing that,
    I might take you up on your generosity!\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\neBay, here
    I come."
