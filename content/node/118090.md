  India and wanted to get suggestions for typeface. Must use a font licenced for embedding
  in eBook formats. Preferably open type or Typekit.\r\n\r\nWould apperciate any suggestions."

  body: "I'd refrain from forcing embedded fonts onto the reader of an ebook. They
    are free to choose their fonts, line spacing, margins, etc to suit them. And because
    you do not control the screen size nor the resolution, choosing a font might make
    the ebook unreadable.\r\n\r\nDon't."

  body: My understanding is, with most eBook readers, the user defined font preference
    will take precedence over fonts embedded in the eBook. So the user still has the
    choice to use their prefered font if they do not like the embedded one. Is this
    not true?

  body: "I wouldn't make that assumption because I've seen eReaders which don't (devices
    and apps).\r\n\r\nBuilding an eBook is like writing a website: you never know
    what system you're on and how good/bad a job the browser (or its version) does
    with interpreting your content's styling. If it supports the styling at all, that
    is. I'd keep it as simple as possible...\r\n\r\nAnd personally, I find nothing
    more annoying than an ebook which overrides my settings because whoever implemented
    it wanted to be fancy :-)"

  body: "Which eReaders don't allow users to choose their fonts?\r\n\r\nLike most
    other web designers, I use specific font combinations on all the sites I design
    and then test on different devices and browsers to ensure performance. Yes, typography
    on electronic devices is a significant challenge but it our job as designers to
    take on this challenge. The Web would be very visually uninspiring if we all let
    browsers make typographic choices for us.\r\n\r\nI never suggested I want to be
    fancy, unnecessarily. The most important thing, obviously, is the text is readable.
    So I am looking for suggestions on a body font that is readable and display fonts
    that are readable and have the right personality. And, of course, can be used
    in eBook readers, etc., etc."

  body: "What I meant to say was that on most ereaders (Kindle, Nook, Sony, various
    apps) the user chooses a font and other visuals for the book. Often times the
    ereader's software (or an ebook app) is rather oblivious of the font that an ebook
    \"ships\" with, and overrides it, and different ereaders provide varying CSS support.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    forcing a font onto a user makes for a grumbling customer because they've already
    chosen the font that they're most comfortable with on their device. You never
    know how your font (and other visuals) will look on their display because you
    don't know the display size, resolution, render quality, etc. (I've even found
    that different fonts on different devices provide different sets of glyphs, so
    you may want to be careful with diacritics or ornaments or other fanciness.)\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest to design an ebook with font, margin, line-spacing, etc as user-defined
    variables."
