body: "Slow Print Letterpress announces [[http://slowprint.com/zen |\"Zen of Business
  Cards\"]] letterpress cards in black and white.\r\nWe've provided templates for
  convenience, or will accept client provided art in the same Zen spirit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P2040015_6482.jpg]\r\n\r\nOne
  popular option is to order these thrifty black and white cards and then get  a couple
  of groovy iconic rubberstamps (like from our dear friend [[http://ljackson.com|
  Leavenworth Jackson]] ) to customize the cards beyond your wildest dreams!\r\n\r\nThey're
  printed on the very lovely Strathmore Writing Cover (Soft White 110#)\r\nOne catch:
  we have to fill a press-sheet of 6 to 12 slots before making the film and plates
  and printing, so putting out the word to your friends and peeps will get you your
  own cards that much faster!"
