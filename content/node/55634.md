  assignment for my Typology class. The word was tweak, and we could take it any way
  we wanted to and this is where it lead for me. I did handlettering in my sketchbook,
  then traced it in Illustrator. I changed it up a bit though. My teacher suggested
  I make some 3D so that's exactly what I did. I did the word tweak to give it emphasis.
  My only real inspiration for this (other than the word \"tweak\" itself) was the
  drink special sign I draw every week for the restaurant work. I alternate these
  typefaces above on the sign so I combined them all in this one piece. If I had to
  pick a time period this reflects, I'd have to say Dada, only because of the combination
  of multiple typefaces. My grid obviously contradicts that though. How about you
  tell me...what time period to YOU GUYS think this piece reflects. I'm interested
  in knowing what you think."

  body: "Cali,\r\nI really like this interpretation of the sketchbook assignment.
    It is very funny, and I'm sure that everyone from the class can relate to it.
    I remember liking it when I say it in your sketchbook, but tracing it in Illustrator
    really helped to clean it up. I like the combination of fonts and the turning
    of words. It makes it seem interactive and it helps my attention just looking
    at the different text. I could really see this as a poster. It kind of has a feel
    of an inspirational poster. Not in a cheesy way, just that it is funny but still
    has a strong message. I'd like to see this with some color worked into it. I think
    it could really change the mood of the piece in any direction you'd want it to
    go. I love \"tweak\" in 3d and with all the letters connected.\r\n\r\nOh, and
    where do you work? I'd love to see the inspiration for this.\r\n\r\n-Jessica"
