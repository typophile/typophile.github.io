  when i noticed this ad:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/armorath/3286395091/\r\n\r\ni
  have no idea what the rest of the typeface looks like, but from the sample, it seems
  quite modular.\r\n\r\nwhat do you people think?"

  body: "I think that the capital letters are inherently modular unless they\u2019re
    drawn in certain calligraphic styles. But that\u2019s another story\u2026\r\n\r\nModular
    in the context of Fontstruct is not the same as modular in the context of Fontlab
    or other font editors. I can construct modular letters in Fontlab and still have
    fine control over kerning, sidebearings, OT features, etc. that just don\u2019t
    exist in the modular world of Fontstruct. That kind of stuff adds days or weeks
    of effort to a font and is what separates the free stuff from the pay stuff.\r\n\r\nTo
    paraphrase Leslie Cabarga, the difference between a free font and a pay font is
    about six weeks."

    was based on a hand-painted sign he saw in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere is an older Typophile
    thread on Baby Teeth <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/2547\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    would describe Baby Teeth as being made of simple yet bold geometric shapes, but
    that is not exactly the same as letters made from standardized parts (i.e., modules).\r\n\r\nP.S.
    And James makes a good distinction about how the word \"modular\" is used within
    FontStruct and outside of it."

  body: thanks guys, i see what you are saying and after posting i looked at it on
    the fontshop website, i guess my point is not that Bebit is used as a sample,
    but that all the letters chosen for the sample could be made with fontstruct,
    why didn't they use the word BABY maybe?
