body: I've been searching around trying to find film or television shows that use
  blackletter in their title but can't seem to find or think of any that do! The only
  one I have right now is There Will Be Blood. There must be at least one other that
  uses blackletter, it can't be /that/ difficult, can it? Anyway, would really appreciate
  some other examples.

    and you're bound to hit a few examples."

    used blackletter for the titles, though there is some attempt at evocation of
    historical type styles."
