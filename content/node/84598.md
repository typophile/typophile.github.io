  following a tweet by the every brighter glowing\_@jasonsantamaria, I found myself
  at odds with his classing Adobe's fantastic Chaparral family as a Slab Serif.\_\r\n\r\nMy
  expectation of the term would be obviously with serifs, and they would all be horizontal
  portions of rectangles parallel or perpendicular to the baseline without exception.\_\r\nSuch
  serif structure and the related lack of stress in curves team up to form what I
  always thought of as a slab serif...\_Chaparral has some in common with my definition
  in the baseline serifs, some of the curves are unaffected by a diagonal pen.\_\r\nBut...
  Most of the common characters in\_Chaparral show the liveliness of the pen, and
  there are lots of angled serifs, more in the class of the \u201Cold style\u201D\_class,
  than the Slab Serif sub-class of\_\u201Cmodern\u201D\r\n\r\nToday's classifying
  and sub-classing of\_type designs is not entirely dissimilar to trying to guess
  the weight of angel, and it may be that my old definitions have been shifted by
  the sands of type, so perhaps some more opinions would help.\r\n\r\nTo partly establish
  a mass of examples of my opinion, I introduce Myfonts.com, and Fontshop.com, and
  then search for\_\u201Cslab serif\u201D. Both seem to follow my definition, for
  at least a few fonts, and for the most part keep to it for 80% or so, before the
  search engines seem to break down.\_\r\nWhy e.g. FontShop finds fonts with no serifs
  a way down the search results, or why Myfonts thinks \u201COklahoma\u201D is a slab,
  introduces mystery. But when the search result is wrong, it's really wrong. The
  other 80% or so of the search results do match my definition of slab serif."

    serifs than a Slab. But if we agree on Clarendon-like typefaces as being Slab
    Serifs \u2014 with stroke contrast and features left over by the pointed pen \u2014
    Chaparral could count for one too, a humanist one. (Serifa/Clarendon, Caecilia/Chaparral)
    Or do you mean to argue that Slab Serif is a subclass of modern? (Uh!)"

  body: "David, I think you're saying that the serifs alone aren't enough to classify
    something as a slab or not. And I totally get that point. I think I take a more
    loose approach on this one. I think a classification of slab or old style could
    both be considered right. Chaparral is a pretty thorough hybrid sharing lots of
    traits with both. But then perhaps one could also argue that its main use could
    have some influence (I certainly use it more in the way I would a normal text
    face, which only supports your point too).\r\n\r\nI'm comfortable calling it either,
    though I still tend to prefer slab. It's where the essence of the face sits for
    me."

  body: "Jason, \r\n\r\nI'm with you. I'll find it useful from now on to qualify this
    classification as being Modern or Old Style Slab for additional clarity when talking
    type! It will also be useful for me to remember to do this classification relative
    to the type and typography a client is looking for, for best results. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    \r\n\r\ndb\r\n\r\n"

    seeing come from the fact that you're using the <em>search</em> function \u2014
    which on these two sites finds any text that matches your search term. This is
    a job instead for <em>browsing</em> which results in fonts that have been filed
    in preselected categories (see <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/category/\">FontShop</a>
    and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/category/>MyFonts</a> category pages). Of
    course, this is a usability issue which could be improved by including a link
    to a matching category when you perform such a search (search for \"slab serif\",
    get a link to the Slab Serif category page, then a list of all the fonts that
    match the search term).\r\n\r\nOn Chaparral: I empathize with all sides, and this
    example adds yet more fodder when I argue with those who find no use for narrower
    subclasses, or even classification at all."
