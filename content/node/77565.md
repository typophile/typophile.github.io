  for a while with the intention of learning Fontlab while digitizing it. From what
  I\u2019ve read here this seems to be the best way to get \u201Cstuck in\u201D.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s
  the scan.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/block-scan_4481.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
  here\u2019s a pdf of my progress so far.\r\n\t\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/01-draft1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso
  if anybody knows if this typeface happens to exist somewhere I\u2019d appreciate
  it. Like I said this was for learning purposes so I guess that would help to see
  where I\u2019m going wrong. I was considering making it a freebie after I\u2019m
  done if it doesn\u2019t currently exist. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been looking for a decent
  \u2018how to\u2019 guide for designing a typeface and Kris Sowersby\u2019s article
  on I love typography is the best I could find. Any other suggestions are much appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSe\xE1n"

  body: looks good to me. Can I ask why you strayed from the original E?

    some of the characters. Do you mean the alternative E with the bevel edges or
    the fact that I made the three strokes less even?"

  body: "This sort of thing has been done a lot, so the thing that will sell it is
    what clever bits you put into it\u2014the places you stray from the obvious solution.\r\n\r\nWith
    that in mind, your /S/s/$/ is I think the strongest (as it appears in the image
    above; the pdf seems to be different). /H/ is an interesting solution, I wonder
    how it would perform in context... /A/ also really appeals to me, though there's
    nothing particularly new about it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I thought, though, was
    Yikes, that 7 is kooky. I see what you were going for, but it does not work. I
    think a sloped stem, somewhere in between that of the /Y/ and vertical, would
    be best.\r\n\r\nThe flipped /W/ doesn't look good as an /M/. Try making a square
    version. What would it look like to take that /N/ and repeat that second part
    of it?\r\n\r\nThe cuts making /b/d/g/h/m/n/p/q/ round-ish look kind of sloppy.
    For the /m/ and /n/, you can definitely take out the cuts sloping to the left
    and make those corners squared. That might not work as well on the others, but
    try it. It's just that that many small changes in direction 1)makes it look like
    just a rough curve from a distance and 2) kind of works against the whole idea
    of rigidity that the font is based on.\r\n\r\n........I just re-read your original
    post. I've been critiquing an old scan of somebody else's font, haven't I?"

  body: "Hi, haha! Forgot about this thread again\u2026 You have indeed been grilling
    my source material. Some of the things you mentioned above I\u2019ve actually
    done in the pdf and I\u2019ve cleaned up a good bit of the lowercase as well as
    drawn a new M, 7, H, etc\u2026 Thanks for the feedback though, its helped clarify
    some of my decisions. Anything else, I\u2019d really appreciate."
