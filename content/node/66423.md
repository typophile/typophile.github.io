body: "I recently visited <strong>Het huis van Alijn</strong>, a small history museum
  in Ghent \u2013 Belgium. It has some interesting posters from the 1930's on display,
  which you can see on [[http://www.prepressure.com/library/fun/huis-van-alijn|this
  page]] of my site. Most of all I liked some of the packaging artwork, such as the
  labelling on a bar of 'Surfin' soap for printaniers'."
