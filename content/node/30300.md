body: Every car's logo seems to use custom type, and pretty cool type at that.  Where
  is all this original work coming from?  Are designers from major foundries commissioned?  Then
  why aren't they making fonts this cool?  And can anyone think of another industry
  that generates as much custom type?

    so much cooler, because they are in chrome and not in black and white? ;-)\r\n\r\nWhen
    it comes to those script-like car logos, it makes a big difference to make ONE
    word look good or to make a typeface, because of the problem of all the letter
    ligatures. I am just in the process of making a font inspired by car logos, and
    I can tell you it's not easy. Without the relatively new OpenType technology it
    would be impossible at all. So I learned pretty quick, why there are not much
    fonts in this style.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

    lot easier to make six or eight letters \"cool\" than an entire set of glyphs.
    With a font you might have to change the shape of one letter to provide visual
    consistency with others.\r\n\r\nBasically, there is a big difference between creating
    a logo and creating a font."

    final C is obviously inverted.  And here's something from a recent Nissan promotion:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_5140.gif]Imagine
    that with clean lines rather than brushstrokes.

    and no one has ripped off or digitized. It has even taken Franklin Gothic and
    put it's own spin on it, so that when you see a genuine Porsche ad it is in genuine
    Porsche Franklin Gothic.\r\n\r\nLand Rover has been using fonts that the public
    can buy. Last year they switched their body copy to a font that is sold in England,
    and well, I couldn't see spending the money they were asking. (I've put it in
    Eurostile, and Y&R have been okay with the results -- because we are getting paid.)\r\n\r\nMany
    of the cars have fonts that look original, but they have been modified to get
    the \"logo type look.\"\r\n\r\nIt remind me of publishing -- during the days when
    every titled was handlettered. Only, they weren't all handlettered -- so many
    were handtailored. A swash added here, a line deleted there - and voila - a great
    looking three word title..."

  body: Interestingly, the American and Japanese automakers (Honda, Toyota, Ford,
    etc.) tend to create custom wordmarks for every model. The European makers (BMW,
    Mercedes, VW) avoid this and have a standard typeface for their entire line.
