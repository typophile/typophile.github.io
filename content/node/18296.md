  across now... I just love the handwriting/font that it uses!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/baycafemenu.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nCan
  you tell if it's a font or just someone's handwriting? If anyone can identify it,
  I would be forever grateful! :) \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your help,\r\nCerilene

  body: "If this helps, it's not one of the 300 ClickArt Handritten (HW) fonts (unfortunately),
    like one of the recent posts. Part 11 of the Script Guide is the right one, as
    Lex suggested, but I'm afraid I can't save you any more time with a quick answer.\r\n\r\nAs
    I have said (too) many times before, fonts like this can be made for $9 or less
    with a sample of your own printing, so there are an almost unlimited number of
    them out there, including many that are probably not being distributed. Your best
    bet if you don't see an exact match is to find something you think has the same
    'feel', and use that.  It can be very frustrating trying to match a hand-made
    font that may be one-of-a-kind.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    on your site, and (in addition to finding like 20 other fonts I must now have
    :)) I found an extremely similiar font that will do... Benito HW/Penny's Hand.
    \r\n\r\nThanks again for all your help! :)\r\nCerilene :)"
