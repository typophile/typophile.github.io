body: "I'm about to suggest FF Milo to one of my clients and I'm pondering which weights
  are reasonable for combination. I'd thought I'd find some printed material in the
  latest Font Book, but Milo is missing in there. Also I've printed out the pdfs available,
  but it's difficult to decide on the basis of a few lines of text printed with an
  inkjet printer. \r\n\r\nThanks to <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31150\">this
  thread</a> I've narrowed the choice to the text weight and now the question is which
  additional weight looks good for emphasizing. Italic is fine without any doubt,
  but concerning medium or bold, looking at the inkjet printed pdfs I'm hesitating:
  medium looks as if there is not enough color difference in comparison to the text
  weight, whereas bold seems to be too strong. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Which weight
  is better suited as a companion for Milo text?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi, Tina. FontBook came off the presses just a few months before FF Milo
    was released, so it was unfortunately not possible to include it.\r\n\r\nI believe
    FF Milo Medium is intended as an emphasis for Regular. And Bold complements the
    Text weight. The contrast would be too low otherwise, as you've observed.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why they are sold in these two packages:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_milo_1_ot/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_milo_2_ot/\r\n"

  body: "Hi Stephen, thanks for your help. \r\nI'd seen these packages, too, and I'm
    sure there are lots of thoughts behind grouping the fonts as they're offered.
    On the other side, it's always the tiny details which keep bugging, no? But ok,
    as there might only a few words to be emphasized and not long parts of text, and
    the overall amount of text won't be that much at a time, the text/bold combo might
    be fine then. "

    other long texts.
