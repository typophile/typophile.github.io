  office based in Istanbul, and, as is the case with many younger architects like
  me, I have been trying to resist the appeal of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAny advice on a
  font that is 21st century, firm and yet approachable, with subtle attention to detail,
  would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "I agree with Nick, you need to develop a corporate identity that includes
    your logo, font(s), colors, stationery design (letterhead, business card, envelope,
    etc.), formats for proposals and presentations, and so forth. \r\n\r\nIt all needs
    to work together, and it all needs to communicate your firm's identity and style."

  body: "Dear Members,\r\n\r\nI see that I have not fully described our situation
    - my apologies. We needed this font for our logo only, since everything else was
    already Helvetica, including the text on our drawings.\r\n\r\nWe needed to differentiate
    our logo from everything else. By the way, we ended up drawing it.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your input."

  body: "Thanks for the additional information.  If all (or most) of your corporate
    documents are in Helvetica, and you intend to keep them that way, then putting
    your logo in a similar but different contemporary typeface could be a mistake
    unless done very carefully. \r\n\r\nIt's like a building in which all the windows
    are identical except for one which is just slightly different. It could create
    an inconsistent look, and may even look like a mistake. \r\n\r\nIf you're stuck
    with Helvetica for most docs, then pick a typeface for your logo that coordinates
    well and is clearly different from helvetica (a serif typeface, for example, or
    maybe a san serif that's very condensed or a different weight or in some obvious
    way looks very different from the Helvetica type in your documents, so that it
    doesn't look like it was supposed to match but didn't due to a mistake).\r\n\r\nA
    better alternative, though, is to develop new design standards for ALL your firm's
    documents, so that your logo, stationary, and all publications work harmoniously
    together. "

  body: "Dear JamesM,\r\n\r\nWe had similar concerns and decided to draw a logo that
    comprised the letters of our company name, but drawn in a manner completely different
    from that of Helvetica. \r\n\r\nAt first glance it appears to be a simple serif
    font, but the letters themselves hint at very simple building plans. We tried
    to not overdo it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your input."

  body: ex Cathedra, it would help if you could show us your logo.  It's hard to suggest
    fonts for a logo unless we can see it.  When you are typing a new post, there's
    an "insert image" link below where you are typing that lets you upload an image.
