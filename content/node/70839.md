body: I'm looking for a typeface for a logo, and I have in mind a sans-serif capital
  N with half-rounded caps. I'm not sure if I've ever actually seen the type of design
  I'm looking for, and I don't know the exact terminology to search through font databases.
  I've mocked up the idea based on Mg Open Modata bold (left). My variant is on the
  right, but I'd prefer the points to be more like one half of a gothic arch than
  the current rounded-rectangle. Has anyone seen such a typeface before?

  body: Thanks Patrick, Diavolo Bold is pretty much exactly what I was looking for.
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_cocon_1_ot/|FF Cocon]] from
    FontShop is also pretty close, and has nicer miniscules than Diavolo. But I think
    I'll stick with Diavolo for the capital N. Cheers!
