  be <a href=\"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/97\">Burgues Script</a>, but the slant and
  the swirls are different. The closest I get is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/spencerian-palmer-penmanship-pro/regular/glyphs.html\">Spencerian
  Palmer Penmanship Pro</a> but there are inconsistencies, most notably in the lowercase
  \"l\". And it is definitely not <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/sudtipos/compendium_ot/?s=c\">Compendium</a>
  neither.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dum-Dum-Girls_type_6550.jpg]"
