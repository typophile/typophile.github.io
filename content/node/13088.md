  them... They're those centered, symmetrical logos with a cap on the front and an
  equal size cap on the end. They're almost as ubiquitous as they are tasteless. (See
  the attached example of a bad one I threw together for reference.)\r\n\r\nMy question
  is: \r\nIs there a good historical example in some text book that people are deriving
  these bad logos from? Or is there some design hack textbook that details this as
  a \"can't fail\" logotype? "

  body: That style was popular when I first broke into the design business. It came
    from sign painters originally. I don't think its a bad look if you balance the
    weight of the first and last characters with the small caps. Most clients wouldn't
    let you have the time or spend the money to let you do this.

  body: Joe, I think an educated guess would be that the use of two caps on the end
    derives from a desire to simulate the gradated looked created by lettering artists.
    Sorry my other responses weren't <em>exactly</em> on topic. If you look at the
    <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/">gallery</a> at Letterheard fonts
    you'll many samples.  Perhaps people at first tried using different pointsizes
    to mimic the gradation but realized that it wasn't working and so simply decided
    to use to caps on either end. Maybe?

    it could also have happened because they were trying to mimic the curved lettering

    centuries.\r\n\r\nI agree with Tiffany that \"modern\" use might have been inspired
    by <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/jiansabu/images/orangequeen.jpg\">curved
    lettering</a> commonly used by artists and engravers during the 1800-1900s.\r\n\r\nEarly
    lithography also gave lettering artists freedom. You can see it in this <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/jiansabu/images/circus1.jpg\">circus

    these typefaces to create logos and/or messages are forgetting the parts to a
    whole. like the quick impression of the word is the absolute most important thing
    as a viewers eyes happen to flash across a page or sign. and in some instances
    i would agree...\r\n\r\nbut in the realm of logos it seems to me, that the most
    important part of having one at all, is having one that is balanced, well thought
    out and easily readable/translatable.\r\n\r\nit's funny because just the other
    day i was strolling around chicago (north ave/halsted area if youre familiar)
    and had nearly the same thought hit me. why are logotype letters so unbalanced
    when it comes to faked small caps. (especially when it is in large signage or
    poster format that everyone must see) or better yet why is it accepted practice
    by designers. both are easily asnwered questions i guess, but ya know we have
    to have something to complain about here every now and then :)\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "I think burried within all of our comments is a chief reason why many current
    designers lack sensitivity on typographic balance.\r\n\r\nMany of us might recall
    the great debates about typography that ensued in the '90s during the transition
    from high-end proprietary digital typesetters to open-ended PostScript imagesetters.\r\n\r\nUp
    until that point, whenever you required type, you generally marked up the copy
    and sent it to a type house. Getting typeset copy and composed headlines was not
    cheap! Therefore, any designer that didn't comprehend type spec-ing (sp?) caused
    unnecessary expense and needless delays.\r\n\r\nAlso, many professional typesetters
    would tweak photo headlines and galley type output in spite of poor markup (especially
    if it was a good client). The sins of the graphic designers were often corrected
    by typographers.\r\n\r\nOnce the front-end PostScript devices were put into the
    hands of graphic designers and copy writers, the need for professional typographers
    and typesetters went the way of the town blacksmith.\r\n\r\nWe often argued that
    most graphic designers had broader training and that typography was highly specialized.
    But as frequently happens, tight budgets prevail.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons
    why I left the type industry and moved on to multimedia and Internet publishing
    was that the market was dwindling for dinosaurs such as myself.\r\n\r\nI'm happy
    to see that many members of Typophile strive to maintain the craft and art of
    typography.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old, but I'm

    hit the spot in their mind. and there's what the power of computers can do. put
    typographic intelligence and legitimacy to bed for a long time.\r\n\r\nas of late,
    alot of people i've been working with on projects (clients) have come to me because
    they said my type was different. it got me wondering if they like things i do
    because it just looks like something you cant do in word and they know it, or
    if it's actually because it's good? i'm not a good judge of my own work and i
    sorta think neither are a lot of clients i work with, but it's just worth noting
    that these days, type that looks so far out of the norm and unsafe is what attracts
    people's attention. people being those who are mostly unfamiliar with the nuances

    with you. The Peter Pocs poster is an example where a little more care should
    have been taken. I really don't even think the trick was necessary for the design.
    I'd argue that the poor type treatment distracts from what could have potentially
    been a very strong poster. The enlarged S and A also cause the top line to be
    read, initially, as SOFFENBACHA.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me as if Seymour Chwast drew
    those letters. Still, the P and T are a little too heavy.\r\n\r\nThe Sanchez piece
