  font family very similar to that I attached exists. I need a font family with polytonic
  greek. I found this font in same Einaudi books, such as Bruno Snell, La cultura
  greca (2005).\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Adobe fonts (like Arno, Minion, Garamond Premier),
  Times New Roman, Palatino, Baskerville are excluded.\r\n\r\nPlease help me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/13589_3950.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20141103_105901753_iOS_6324.jpg]"

  body: "What I know of Greek fonts first comes from the TeX documentation and I understood
    that the word \"apla\"  was used to refer to that type of Didot font with rolling
    stress. Here is a link http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/greek/greek.faq and
    what is said about it\r\n<blockquote>\r\nLevy made his Greek fonts after the Didot
    design, a typeface which was originally created two centuries ago by the famous
    Didot printers in Paris and which is still used extensively by Greek printers
    today. Among Greek\r\nprinters, this Didot typeface is known as \"apla\" (plain),
    but often outsiders call it incorrectly \"Greek roman\".\r\n</blockquote>\r\nA
    version of Monotype Greek 90 is called \u1F09\u03C0\u03BB\u1FB6 by Haralambous'
    Atelier Fluxus Virus http://www.polytoniko.org/fonts.php?newlang=en#AFV where
    \u1F09\u03C0\u03BB\u1FB6 might just mean \"regular\". So maybe I misinterpreted
    the documentation though Haralambous in a paper entitled \"From Unicode to Typography,
    a Case Study: the Greek Script\", has a  subsection 1.7.1 on the apla style where
    he includes the italic and the bold.\r\n\r\n"

    was used to characterize this Didot type and yes the word actually means plain
    (or simple) in contrast to composite or complex."

  body: "Dear TEODF,\r\nI don't know which font this actually is. But I can add that
    absolutely the same one has been used by Adelphi publisher for some 'older' books,
    as e.g. <quote> La ragione errabonda<quote> by Giorgio Colli, up to about 1995.
    Afterwards, this publishing house used the more ordinary -and, I would add, more
    ugly- greek series of MS Times New Roman (!).\r\nI know that when wanting something,
    one wants EXACTLY that; but at least I may suggest something appearing to be inspired
    by similar approach :[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sblgreeksample_4947.jpg]
    provided  by the [[http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLGreek.aspx|Society
    of Biblical Literature]].\r\nIt has the same 'broken' ends, some 'archaicity'
    in the ductus, but it differs for the light slant to the right and more explicitly
    in some features, as the theta design.\r\nThe hunting goes on"

    la Ragione Errabonda, printed in 1982 still with metal glyphs - you can see some
    vertical traces between the letters):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font
    greco Adelphi_4218.jpg]\r\nInteresting the effect of Baskerville and 'greek' combined
    in the same text, as in Einaudi Snell.\r\nSome difference in the choosen form
    of 'rho', but indeed the same font."
