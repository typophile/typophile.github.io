  longer have the font file and am having troubles identifying the font. My guess
  is that the font was included free with some low-end, off-the-shelf, consumer graphics
  program like CorelDRAW. Can you help me identify this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zvw_3422.jpg]"

  body: It is similar to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsnerflake/romana_demi_ot/?&sample_text=Zumbro&sample_size=120&acs_pt=32&update=0">Romana</a>,
    but I am unable to find the precise weight used in the logo. Apart from the fact
    that the letters in your sample might have undergone some squooshing, they look
    as if they had been wider from the start, the stroke contrast appears to be less
    pronounced than in the version I linked to and the serifs are more sturdy.

  body: I would say it <em>is</em> Romana with a stroke added (to make it bolder)
    and artificially condensed a bit.
