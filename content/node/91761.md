body: "Hey!\r\n\r\nI've been working on a site and really like using Futura for headlines
  (via typekit), but am having tons of trouble finding a proper text font that balances
  well. I didn't want to resort to Helvetica as the body text, but found that nothing
  else blended in. \r\n\r\nI know I don't want a slab serif, and have experimented
  with quite a few options. At the moment, I'm not even sure if I want sans or serif.\r\n\r\nI
  surprised myself when I found that I really liked [[https://typekit.com/fonts/ltc-bodoni-175|bodoni]],
  but ended up feeling it was too dominant. If possible, I'd love some advice on pairing
  a text font for my site in particular. Any quick thoughts?\r\n\r\nThe site: http://bit.ly/krJPIa\r\n(My
  Choices are anything in [[https://typekit.com/fonts?collection=personal|this collection]],
  btw)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!"
