    using Century Gothic like using Arial? Maybe you should go more avant garde\u2026?\r\n\r\nShagging
    sheep, eh? ;-)\r\n\r\nI got the impression that <em>Apple & Berry</em> is just
    an example, the real name is something different, right?"

  body: I'm sorry to say it, but Century Gothich does NOT look "fresh and new" to
    me. More like... "old & common". Why don't you try something like BELLO from Underware
    or such. Now that would look fresh and tasty. Also if you like have a look at
    my foundry to see if you find something appealing? http://www-macrhino.com

    different.\r\n\r\nI have access to Adobe Font Folio at college. Haven't had a
    proper chance to go through it, so if anyone could suggest something from in there,
    that would be great.\r\n\r\nI don't have much knowlegde in type, so excuse the
    rush of my words."

  body: "I think 'Kabel', for example, is / looks even more dated, than 'Century Gothic'.
    :)\r\n<em>( Ooh, And, I wouldnt recommend using 'Helvetica' either. Its totally
    overused, and rarely used good, or nicely. And, It doesnt look really 'modern',
    either, at least to me. Wait, Is the last one 'Georgia'? You may also want to
    use something else than a good but standard typeface, coming pre installed on
    most household computers. )</em>\r\n\r\nI would recommend looking for a smooth,
    soft, maybe rounded, slightly organic looking typeface. <em>( Hmm, Maybe something
    like '<a href=\"http://www.dstype.com\" target=\"_blank\">Boldina</a>', by Dino
    dos Santos. Or even the lovely new '<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1129&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000173\"
    target=\"_blank\">Whomp</a>', by Alejandro Paul. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

    below, Franklin Gothic might be considered (your college probably has this too).
    It looks about as good as anything else so far.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/franklin_4416.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
    a cheery little serif I think is in the Font Folio:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/versailles_4171.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
