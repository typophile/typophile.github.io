  I traced this as the source image was not good enough for ID purposes. I'd like
  to track down the name of the original typeface - after endless searching it appears
  there is no modern, digital version of this.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ob1_4821.png]\r\nIt
  shares properties with other Bauhaus-style geometric sans serif display faces, such
  as ITC Bauhaus, Blippo, Ronda etc. It comes closest to Harry from Red Rooster (but
  with ITC Bauhaus-style M and N) or Linotype Horatio (again with different M N R).
  Perhaps the original was one of the aforementioned, but using alternates not carried
  over into the digital version?\r\n\r\nHelp with original name, designer or foundry
  welcome."

  body: "Given the lack of responses I'm guessing those of you who took a stab at
    this ended up as confused as I was - but I think I've actually located it!\r\n\r\nThis
    appears to be Blippo Bold, a somewhat rare weight of this iconic typeface, but
    take a look at the specimen over at the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html|Bowfin
    Printworks Bauhaus pages]]. As noted on that page, and in a [[http://typophile.com/node/33443|previous
    thread here]] and [[http://typophile.com/node/97547|also here]], there is a modern
    digitization from FontBank called [[http://luc.devroye.org/FontBank--Brandish--1993.jpg|Brandish]]
    (though I can't find a licensed, paid version of this for sale anywhere).\r\n\r\nBrandish
    does not include the regular S, only the alternate, which is disappointing. And
    regarding the difference in the R (my rendering had a rounded top corner on the
    stem) - that is probably my mistake in interpreting the low resolution, distorted
    sample I had."
