  body: "Hey Dany,\r\nGlad to see you here :)\r\n\r\nIts' flow definitely makes a
    feel of forest as the name promises (heb. \"yearot\"). The right hand of \"Ain\"
    (2nd letter in the big word) looks like a leaf after rain :)\r\n\r\nSorry I can't
    say any smart typographic things :)\r\nI'll leave it for professionals.\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "I really like it (can read hebrew at a crawl, but can't really understand
    much). The Lamed is very graceful, and the Ayin's slight droop on the right does
    feel like the fall of a leaf or branch. I love the way the Nun hugs the following
    letters in your example. I wonder if the quote marks are a bit too close to the
    Yod? At a smaller size, might they seem connected? I don't think there would be
    any confusion on what was written, but for purely asthetic reasons?\r\n\r\nNice
    job.\r\n\r\nI'll admit, I don't haven't looked closely at any modern Hebrew fonts
    since I was living on a Kibbutz in the Northern Galilee...8 years ago. "

    it got a lovely, smooth, organic feel to it, as well.. <em>Very nice and quite

  body: "There are a lot of nice forms in this, and the overall impression is very
    pleasant. There are a few letters, though, that seem a bit too shapeless. This
    is always a danger in soft designs: letters can become blobby and lacking in dynamism.
    For the most part, you have avoided this, and most of the letters are nicely rigorous.
    These are the ones I think need attention: tet, lamed, ayin, and shin. The top
    part of the tzadi is also a bit weak.\r\n\r\nCompare, for example, the blobbiness
    of the left side of the tet with the much greater dynamism in he or chet.\r\n\r\nAs
    well as suffering from this shapelessness, the ayin is also a bit dark. You need
    to compensate the weight where the strokes cross. The adjacent double strokes
    of the alef also create a bit of a dark spot in text; I would try making the left
    stroke just a bit lighter to compensate.\r\n\r\nThe final forms look nice. It
    would be good to see another sample with these in context."

  body: I can read Hebrew, and I think the font is very nice to read! I can't give
    you educated comments on the weight etc., but have you thought about exploring
    the options that Opentype can offer in terms of ligatures. It might not be so
    appropriate in this font, but I'm sure that there are some character combinations
    that don't work so well that can be solved with Opentype.
