  appreciate any help in  identifying it. It might have been used with Kingsley Hotstamp
  Machines and may have been one of the typefaces The Kingsley Company sold.\r\n\r\nIt
  has this nice serif off the horizontal cross on the A. And then there is the looped
  center of the W.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help. We would like to buy more of this type
  and also find a font to match for an online personalization tool I'm building.\r\n\r\nKendall

  body: "Interesting. Yes I see all of the letters except A match Odessa. I can't
    find the Alternates you are referring to though.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like something
    that a typehouse would have done or do you think that someone switched out all
    of the A's in my set sometime since the 40's when I suspect this type was cast?
    Hmm, intentional or accident? I think the A is so close to the R. But I'm not
    an expert."
