  Arer these commercial typefaces, or hand lettering? Any ideas are appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lettering1_5977.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lettering2_5656.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lettering3_5091.jpg]"

  body: The top two examples look hand-made to me. The bottom sample has more consistency
    through the forms which make me think it's a typeface.

  body: The one at the bottom is <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/sphinx-rr/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D57%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DL%25E2%2580%2599ARCHITECTURE%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D28">Sphinx</a>.
    I agree that the other two were hand lettered.

  body: Thanks for the input, especially in identifying the Sphinx, Mark. I was pretty
    certain the center one was hand lettered, but I thought the top one (my favorite)
    might be a typeface, although I do see some small inconsistencies in the ends
    of the strokes.
