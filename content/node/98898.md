  window>appearances panel, but I was wondering, is there any way to show the control
  vectors/points of the mask layer while still on the main layer?\r\nIt would be really
  helpful for matching up certain parts of a character in the mask layer without switching
  back and forth from looking at the mask to the main glyph.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    have to select the whole mask and then switch back to the main glyph and it will
    show the mask points as little dotted x points."
