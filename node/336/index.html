  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Wedge has been my primary project for a couple months now. I was inspired at first by the headlines of the SF Chronicle, set in titling Electra. I was also intrigued by the wedge serifs of Underware's Dolly, providing the design's temporary name. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two goals for the project are, first, exploring new ways of modulating strokes, second, establishing an interesting rhythm in continuous text. I'm not sure yet how well I'm succeeding on either count. I think my modulation in the bowls of bdpq is unique. This same modulation seems to combine with the similar shape in hnmu to provide a nice rhythm at the top and bottom edges of a line of text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the attached PDF I included a recently hacked up sans version of font. It is truly a sans since I preserved the modulation of the serifed version and just whacked off the serifs. It's mostly an experiment though and I'd prefer critique of the serif design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm very anxious to get feedback on this design. I have a whole summer ahead of me to work on this so I'd like to know if I'm going in the right direction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Download PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you can be duly proud of having made such a serviceable, polished face so quickly. With some finishing tweaks (and a bunch more extra characters!) this face could be used to set many types of works very nicely. The color is right on for the proportions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do have palpable reservations however if this is more than an academic exercise: it's too &quot;80's Adobe&quot;. It has that flow (which of itself is nice), but honestly it's hard to see too many third-parties getting too excited over it. A certain original modulation is too subtle a thing to be appreciated by people outside a certain circle of type designers! :-/ The overall softness in your joins seems somewhat &quot;nostalgic&quot;, in a way that most people don't seem to appreciate these days. Or it could all be in my head! :-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Assuming the above even bothers you, I'm not sure what I'd recommend. Probably just finish it in the direction it's going (since it's doing it so well), and have a very nice usable font that strongly demonstrates your abilities of making a solid mainstream text face - not as easy task when you're not closely following an existing source! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, there are certain things in the font that speak to me a lot, like the beak of the lc &quot;f&quot; and the tail of the &quot;q&quot; - wonderful features, well executed. If you feel like you have the energy to make Wedge really great, consider pushing as many of the glyphs as possible in that direction. If you do that, I'm not sure what you would do with the stately but static caps: maybe just leave them as is - caps actually exist in a somewhat different world than the lc set (annoying but true). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some specific things: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UC: I'd make the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;T&quot; narrower - helps spacing. I think the tail of the &quot;Q&quot; should dip lower. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lc: make the ascenders a hair taller. Give the &quot;g&quot; a stronger ear. Make the &quot;m&quot; narrower. Make the &quot;r&quot; braver. The &quot;s&quot; is way off. Give the &quot;y&quot; a much stronger tail. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The asterisk is cool - maybe close it up just a bit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spacing: It seems slightly loose for the point size that it would sing best in. And it's a bit uneven in spots (like &quot;e&quot; is especially loose on both sides). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Weights: I'd make four. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sans: It creates a very interesting paradox! The softness really explodes here, and it's hard to say if it kills it or if it makes it highly original! :-/ Looking at it some more, I think I'm liking at a lot, actually - it seems to have a singular voice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Your design also looks to me like something between Minion and Adobe Caslon. But I like it better than either: less fussy than Minion, but more lively than ACaslon, which is dull. It has the sturdiness of Caslon without the somewhat awkward shapes. I think it could be a very useful text face.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the spacing, I like that it isn't too tight - which I think Minion is. I suspect it is a bit uneven, but I don't have the knowledge to tell you how or where. The round vs straight letters might be something to check.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To my eye the round part of the C, D and G look very slightly too fat in relation to the rest of the caps. They would be more elegant if corrected also. The O and Q don't bother me the same way, I don't know why. This all may have to do with the degree of old style slant and what this dictates about the relation between the slightly diagonal and the vertical 'stroke of the pen'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sans doesn't work for me - it doesn't have the virtues of the serif as it stands.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am an amateur, but the fact that I like your face as a good text face - something rare - moved me to comment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Text looks good, although i'd tighten the spacing more.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are two reasons that the spacing may seem loose. First, i've tried to emulate the looser spacing of older type. Second, I've targeted sizes 9 through 11 which makes the spacing too loose at larger sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Maybe you could try flatening both endings of the lc 's' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Or make more look like the uc 'S'.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lowercase s has consistently bothered me. It may be good to give more flare to the ends of the s, like that found in the lowercase c. I've made a concerted effort in my uppercase to make all the characters structurally different than their corresponding miniscule, to make the two sets belong to one another because of their style instead of just a difference in scale. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I think you should try lowering the contrast in sansserif. To me its looks too much like being the serif version with the serifs cut away.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sans is precisely 'the serif version with the serifs cut away'. I hacked it together in a couple hours just to see what it might look like. If I lowered the contrast in the sans, it might become more useable but I'm certain it would lose it's unique character, it's handwritten feel. Like you suggest, it would be curious, if I find the time, to sharpen the corners of the sans and see what that feels like. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Why did you decide to make soft endings, serifs and forms? You said you were inspired by the electra, which is harder and sharper. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suppose because I was also inspired the Electra of the ratty sci-fi paperbacks I've read so many of. Cheap paper and printing gave the pages a mottled texture and denied Electra its sharpness. On the other hand, my laser printer is woefully capable of reproducing the sharpest corner so I prefer to manually warm and soften the joints of my glyphs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I began work from Electra in the proportions of the lowercase and by the structure of some of the letters: c, f, j, n, p, t. But over time, my initial shapes changed quite a lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Maybe the q's descender (on serif version) is too heavy. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The descender of p is shorter than q's (is that intentional?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe the descender on the p is too light? The serifs at the ends of all my ascenders/descenders are heavy compared to the baseline serifs. I stuck a baseline serif on the p, but I think it could use some additional heft to make it fit in. The descender on p is shorter than q, though not by much. I think the effect is exacerbated by the comparative lightness of the serif. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Lowercase r is too &quot;shy&quot;/narrow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good catch! I guess I really had my designer blinders on here.</div>

I'm trying to recapture the heavy softness of older print. Because of this, I'm actually starting to prefer books printed from xerographic copies of the old print than those re-typeset.

(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Download PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). My previous capitals are stylistically closer to my lowercase but I wasn't satisfied with text in all-caps, and depending on my mood, they galled me within continuous text. The newer set pleases me more in both cases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I'd make the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;T&quot; narrower - helps spacing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When they were narrower (once upon a distant time) they bothered by at small sizes where they seemed too weak, but I'll give them another look. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; make the ascenders a hair taller <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good point. I read recently (I forget where) that the top of the capitals should align with the bottom of the serifs of the ascenders. It seems like good advice and Wedge is just shy of that measure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Make the &quot;m&quot; narrower. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My working theory at this point dictates that the width of the counters of the hmnu shouldn't vary too much, to maintain a consistent rhythm in text. I'd prefer to make them all the same size but I'm too accustomed to having the m and u be narrowed, as I imagine we all are, so I've narrowed these to align with expectations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Spacing: [&hellip;] it's a bit uneven in spots <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure where my problem lies but I think that the sidebearings on my rounds may be too loose. I'd left them this way to avoid bunching on round-round pairs. Perhaps the solution is to kern round-round pairs? I was hoping to achieve great spacing without kerning, since few people can be bothered to use a program that uses Opentype kerns, but I may have to bite the bullet.</div>

Now they are wider, the stress more upright, the serifs relatively thinner etc. If you can refine the old ones without losing their character, I think that would be a better solution for this face. -You can design a different lower case for the new caps!</div>
