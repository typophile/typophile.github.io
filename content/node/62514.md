body: "I have been a graphic designer for over 20 years now, for both print and web.
  I am also an illustrator. My work has been mainly working on print collateral and
  illustration work. Lately I have been working on brand identity. I usually charge
  my work as a lump sum since most of my clients have a set budget. They ask me if
  I can do it for that price or not.\r\n\r\nI recently been approached by an agency
  to help with some logo work for brand identity. They usually work for high profile
  clients like MOMA, Adidas and VIrgin.\r\n\r\nThey have asked me for my daily rate,
  but I have no idea what to charge.\r\nThe agency really likes my work so I want
  to help them out.\r\n\r\nWhat are the going rate hourly or daily for designers with
  a 20 year background?\r\nSorry to ask, I might think some of you might not be convenient
  to let me know, but I really feel I need a ball park and especially in my case for
  an agency who has very big clients.\r\nAre there any going rates based on experience
  etc.\r\n\r\nYour feedback is appreciated and if you have any more questions please
  ask.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nKC"
