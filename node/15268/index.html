<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello all,
I'm fed up with my current internet mail accout (spymac) and would like to try out Gmail, but I don't know anybody who has an account, and it's an invitation only sorta thing.
So — if any kind person out there has a Gmail, and would like to send me an invite, I'd really really appreciate it!
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody>Probably as permanent as Google itself. Google has been around for a long time and it doesn't look like it is going away anytime soon (they raised 4 billion US$ recently in a stock offering).
Gmail is extremely fast, user-friendly, intuitive and un-cluttered when compared with services provided by competitors such as Hotmail.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant,
Incoming and outgoing limit is 10MB. Spam control seems to work similarly to Hotmail. And you get around 2.5 GB of storage.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Maximum attachment size could range from around 6 mb - 10 mb, depending on what type of attachment it is (total message size including encodes cannot exceed 10 mb). I believe that goes for both upstream and downstream.
Anything larger would take forever for the recipient to receive anyway, especially if they are on a slower connection.
Also a very generous 2,500 megabytes (2,5 gig)of total storage space. When Gmail first rolled around, it had a then-unheard-of one gigabyte storage allotment, five hundred times (!) more than Hotmail had at the time (Hotmail later increased that limit to remain competitive.. but so did Google!).
From the official FAQ regarding spam:
"We are committed to keeping unwanted messages out of your inbox. Gmail includes a sophisticated spam filter that we're continuing to improve. The Report Spam button in Gmail is a way for users to help with this effort. It removes spam from the inbox and sends valuable data to the Gmail team working on spam blocking."
Not sure what that translates to in practice, but considering their keen attention to detail and service, I'm sure they are probably at the top of the game regarding spam prevention. Of course much spam can be attributed to users simply not exercising proper e-mail care and leaving it in the wrong places online, thus making it vulnerable to be indexed by web-crawling spam bots.
Personally I've had my Gmail account for well over a year and had 0 spam messages that I cannot attribute to my own carelessnes (I get periodical e-mails that I consider spam from a forum I signed up for a few years ago and unfortunately their unsubscribe address isn't working).
I do not usually adopt the role of being an unwitting viral marketing vector for companies, but I'll make an exception for Gmail since it's served me so well. If anyone needs an invite, give me a shout--I also have 100 available. :-P
They actually seem to refresh after a while, I gave a bunch away already but it's back at 100. Clever to keep the invites going even as a mere formality, because it keeps people talking about it. I have seen many topics like this one on various forums.</div>

<div class=commentbody>From the Gmail help:
<cite>If you don't log in to your account for an extended period of time, we'll mark it 'dormant.' After nine months, Google will delete all messages in the account, close it, and recycle the username. (Other free web-based email providers delete dormant accounts after as few as 30 days.)
If your dormant account is deleted, we can't guarantee that you'll be able to use your previous username again once it has been recycled. Make sure to log in to Gmail regularly!</cite></div>

But on the other hand I dislike the name of the accoun I got.
¿Is there a way to use hotmail trough Gmail? jajaja, maybe that's too much to ask.

<div class=commentbody>Héctor,
Hotmail are funny about accessing it except via the web interface, I think you have to pay to use the POP features.
You could try a third party solution such as <a href=http://www.e-eeasy.com/GetMail.aspx>this</a> to forward your Hotmail messages to Gmail.

<div class=commentbody>I love my gmail account.
As far as filesize and limits, check this out:
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/E-mail/Mail-Utilities/GMail-Drive-shell-extension.shtml
Windows only unfortunately, so I don't use it. Apparently it creates a virtual drive that is attached to your gmail account giving you 2GB (now 2.5GB and climbing) of online storage. I think it somehow circumnavigates the 10MB limit.
I heard that someone had actually run applications from the virtual drive, but that's just too geeky for me :)

Not as free as a gmail account, but reliable and adaptable.

Hrant, thanks to you as well. It's alright, too late on my hotmail account, anyway. I tried to keep it as secure as possible at first, but it's become a depository for offers for various sexual aids from all over Asia. Hotmail's junk filter catches quite a bit of it, but not all. </div>
