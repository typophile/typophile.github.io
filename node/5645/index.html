<div class=commentbody>Hey, great idea! <br>So you need to sequence the glyphs in ascending "potential distinctiveness", right? Like lc "el" could be the first one and lc "g" the 8th. An "early" candidate might be lc "h" and a late one UC "Q". You could also throw in extended-Latin stuff, like an "a-ogonek" as 6th or something. So three more for the middle, maybe "f" for 5th and "J" for 3rd and "y" for 4th? <br> <br>So I got: lhJyfaQg <br> <br>> I should add that the choices are limited to 4 uppercase and 4 lowercase or figures. <br> <br>Why? <br> <br>-- <br> <br>Here's another idea: have a speed test too, where people get to say how many seconds they need to identify a font, and you flash a pangram for increasing durations. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> No vowels! <br> <br>Wh nt? <br> <br>Pangram: an alphabetic one, natch. <br>"Abacist defogs, hijacks luminous parquetry studio, views ex-yakuza." <br>That way the [alert] competitor can more quickly locate key glyphs. Although at the beginning (very short exposure) it's the familiarity with the overall texture of a font that will allow an ultra-quick ID. BTW, this is a place type <i>users</i> will have an advantage over type makers. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>if any of you remember the game NAME THAT TUNE i was thinking along those lines. and as hrant pointed out i think the letters shown should start with most difficult and become easier. for instance, imagine Nick v. Thomas ... Nick says "I can name that typeface in 8 characters." And then Nick says, "oh yeah! well I can name that typeface in 7 characters." And then Thomas says, "I don't believe it. Name that typeface." At this point we would show seven characters (out of the 8), leaving the easiest character out of the showing. It will be done on teams though, with each team having a leader.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If it's always the same set of characters, the "easiest" character will vary from face to face. And heaven help one if the typeface is a sans serif. <br> <br>Or is that the point, that one never knows how difficult it's going to be? <br> <br>The game would be more interesting for everyone (audience in particular) if the characters representing a typeface were those that were most peculiar to that particular face. <br> <br>Tiff, can I be on your team, pleeeease? Or don't you get to play if you're the strict English quizmistress?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think it might be slightly different for different typefaces. <br> <br>But I will say that 'a' and 'g' are usually dead giveaways. <br> <br>I like 'n' or 'h' for difficult but not impossible. 'l' alone would be pretty tough. Many 'o's as well. <br> <br>Caps? 'Q' is usually a giveaway. Sometimes 'R' and 'A'. 'M' would be an in-between. 'H' and 'O' would be usually tougher, all by themselves. <br> <br>The more regular and the fewer features, the less distinctive = harder. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Will you always present the same set of letters for each contest? Will they always be in the same order? It is easier to strategize if both of these things are true. <br> <br>Is this "open book"? Should I plan on packing my specimens collection? <br> <br>Sounds like fun. <br> <br>Will this be a team activity? I pick Stewf. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>ok. I have to say I like the sound of that, Nick. ;^) Miss Tiffany the strict english (not really) quizmistress. you are right, i don't really get to play, which is really sad, but maybe if i can build a template others will volunteer to create some sheets as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think having a fixed set/sequence of characters: <br>1) helps the organizer(s). <br>2) promotes strategizing (like Kent said). <br> <br>I don't think there should be teams - there should be a qualification round (maybe show a couple of complete 8-glyph sets to everybody, get them to write and hand in their answers, and the first 8 corrent respondents qualify), and then have a pairwise elimination tree, with quarter and semi finals, and a final. <br> <br>As for closed/open book, one big advantage of meatspace versus virtual interaction is that you can prevent people from checking references, so I think you should take advantage of that. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>BTW, here's another option: instead of asking "how many glyphs do you need to identify the font", show the glyphs slowly (like 5 seconds each) and the first correct respondent wins. If the first respondent is incorrect, the other guy has until the time limit to answer correctly, otherwise there's a rematch. <br> <br>Audience members shouting out answers will be hung by their finials. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> If the first respondent is incorrect .... <br> <br>Or you could allow multiple responses and just take the first correct one. <br> <br>BTW, the Name That Tune format only really makes sense if you give some intro clue to each font (which is what they did on the game show). That's what allows the contestants to gamble well with how many glyphs they need. <br> <br>The Name That Tune format is more work for you, and slower to perform, but more sophisticated than a brute force speed test. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
