  body: Don't think it's actually a typeface as it, more a custom job based on an
    existing one. You could start for instance with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/|Trade
    Gothic Condensed Bold]], slant it, rework all finials to make them half rounded,
    redraw /R leg (/P plus new leg from /P top right quarter?) and finally add ornaments
    and middle spurs.
