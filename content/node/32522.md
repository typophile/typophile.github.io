  body: "Mysterious. The .pdf tutorial I have from CA July of last year lists a number
    of fonts but not a serif text face; the bodytext is actually set in Syntax and
    the .pdf was made direct from the magazine pages. \r\n\r\nAstarz is it something
    like this one below? It is what they used in the tutorial demonstration screenshots.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_5841.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    this is what you're looking for, then it's called <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/font/pid/409707/Prensa+Book/detail\">Prensa
    Book</a>, but ITC list the foundry/designer as 'unknown' which is pretty rare
    in this day and age.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you could try asking Paul or Richard direct
    at http://www.computerarts.co.uk/contacts\r\n\r\n"
