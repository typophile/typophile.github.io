body: I&#39;ve been trying for weeks to find the font used in the logo of Big Island
  Candies &#40;specifically the words &#34;Big Island&#34;&#41;.  View the logo at
  <a href="http://www.bigislandcandies.com" target="_blank">http://www.bigislandcandies.com</a>.  If
  anyone can help, please do so!  Thanks!

  body: It almost looks like a version of <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=204592"
    target="_blank">Bandolero</a> that has been customized by effectively flipping
    some of the letters &#40;i.e. the openings are now on the bottom, rather than
    the tops of the stems&#41;. <BR> <BR>This may be nothing more than a coincidental
    resemblance, however.

  body: I bet this is a hand-drawn logo, or else highly customized. The descending
    swooshes on the B and D aren&#39;t consistent, and the N doesn&#39;t seem to fit,
    somehow.
