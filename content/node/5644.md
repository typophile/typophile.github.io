body: I just purchased a passel of fonts for megacorp. I&#39;ve been running some
  simple tests to make sure they display and print correctly before I release them
  to my fellow corporate minions. That got me to wondering what the pros do. <BR>
  <BR>When you purchase new fonts &#40;licenses&#41;, do you do a thorough test drive
  of the fonts to check it for accuracies? Do you have documents set up to run in
  different applications to do test drives? Or is there software for this? <BR> <BR>

  body: This may be silly and a little narcissistic, but I always look at my name
    and the figure first. I figure if the typeface has a good W and a double-f lig
    and the figs balance with my name then it can&#39;t be all that bad. After this
    I have a file that I created with all of the glyphs and then 26 vegetable words,
    just to get a quick flavor and sense of the typeface.

  body: 'We usually set up a test document that contains at least one instance of
    each of the new fonts and then print/output the document as if it was moving through
    our production cycle: B&amp;W laser, color laser, low-res PDF, high-res PDF, final
    Epson proof.'

  body: I typically purchase a font based on a specific project or need, so I set
    it in an environment similar to the one I need. If it&#39;s a logo, then hopefully
    they&#39;ve got an online test drive. <BR> <BR>Usually I just use an old text
    I&#39;ve written or some lorem ipsum from <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lipsum</a>.
