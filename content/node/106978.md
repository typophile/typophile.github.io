    it was a very beautiful one in need of a revival; looking at the link you provided,
    the revived digital typeface appears to be quite beautiful.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    though, it's somewhat expensive - not really that bad in price for the one-user
    print license, but the fact that embedding even in PDFs is treated like embedding
    in applications makes me suspect that <em>that</em> will be expensive.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    that they trademarked the name of a typeface by which it was known originally
    (and before they existed) is distressing. A typeface in the public domain can
    be revived by anyone."

      making the original name of the face a trademark, to place anyone else who would
      revive the typeface at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nNot that I can't see why it's

    at the moment) from Sweden, I think. See [[http://www.sinnebild.se/font/large/doves.html]].\r\nThis
    digital revival is used by the Emery Walker Trust for their information leaflets,

  body: Quadibloc, thanks for the kind words about the aesthetic beauty of Doves,
    I'd like to put your mind at rest about PDF embedding because this is permitted,
    unless the PDF is being sold commercially. Similarly if you're planning to embed
    the font into an eBook, app, server application or any other digital product you'll
    need the appropriate licence.

  body: "OK everyone, as the person responsible, let me clear a couple of things up.\r\n\r\n@
    quadibloc/Thomas Phinney  'The revival of the design is a separate question from
    trademark.'/'Yes. But it should be clear what I find objectionable: making the
    original name of the face a trademark, to place anyone else who would revive the
    typeface at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nNot that I can't see why it's tempting; after
    all, they've done the work of cleaning up the design, and locating it as worthy
    of revival.'\r\n\r\nI also appreciate quadibloc's kind words, but I will explain
    my decision to trademark the name.\r\n\r\nThe revival is a separate issue, but
    also the nub of the problem. I am not trying to disadvantage anyone \u2013 go
    ahead, give a revival a try! (BTW not a '*claim*' \u2013  the trademark is registered
    with IPO.gov).\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a case of 'cleaning up the design' as I had also
    initially thought. I soon realized that to produce a good, serious, useable typeface,
    I had to pull it apart and rebuild it, in order to discover how the relationships
    in geometry, strokes, alignments & spacing worked. Not easy when all you've got
    to go on is impressions of a 16pt typeface, produced using linseed based ink on
    rag paper.\r\n\r\nBut what I personally object to, having put all that work in
    \u2013 3 solid years \u2013 is someone coming along, a big foundry for instance,
    and using my drawings as a basis for another revival. And I can't stop anyone
    doing that, as you know.\r\n\r\nAll I can do is trademark the name to protect
    my work in the commercial sphere, thus differentiating it as the first commercial
    digital revival (William Morris's Golden Type name is registered with ITC, but
    it hasn't stopped others doing their own versions). \r\n\r\nAlso to clarify: I
    have never claimed this is the first digital revival in any of the press I've
    done \u2013 those facts seem to get lost in sub edits and transcription \u2013
    I'm quite blatant about this on my blog http://7thsealblog.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/reviving-the-doves-type-%E2%80%93-part-i-2/
    It is the 1st commercially available revival though.\r\n\r\n@ quadibloc 'Also,
    that they trademarked the name of a typeface by which it was known originally
    (and before they existed) is distressing'\r\n\r\nIt is now known as the Doves
    type, Doves or the Doves font, but it had no particular or agreed name during
    its existence as a metal fount. This period lasted from around 1900 to 1916, when
    it was variously known to the owners & employees of the Doves Press as \u2018the
    type\u2019, \u2018the Type\u2019 and, according Doves Press co-founder TJ Cobden
    Sanderson\u2019s diary, \u2018the Doves Press Fount of Type\u2019 [T.J. Cobden-Sanderson,
    21 March 1913. Journals, II, 214.] \r\n\r\nEmery Walker referred to it in his
    court hearing (Walker vs Annie Cobden-Sanderson) in 1923 at Lincoln's Inn as 'Doves'
    ('... my contention is that supposing by a miracle the type could have been recast
    exactly similar to the original Doves, the reputation which had accrued to the
    latter could not be transferred to any copy. Mr Prince, who cut the type and many
    other typefaces for private presses since the days of the Kelmscott Press, is
    now dead.'). \r\n\r\nAs late as 1924 In a letter to Chatto & Windus dated 4 February
    [Marrianne Tidcombe, The Doves Press (2002) pp.84], Coben-Sanderson\u2019s son
    Richard refers to it as the \u2018D.P. Type\u2019. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the most common
    contemporaneous description/name for it appears to be, from TJCS's journals, the
    'Doves Press Fount of Type'.\r\n\r\nFinally, Marianne Tidcombe, in her aforementioned
    book, The Doves Press, refers to it as \u2018the type\u2019 & \u2018the Doves
    type\u2019. I would also argue that the latter is in description, a shorthand
    generic term by which it has retrospectively come to be known (as I have said
    it is also called 'Doves' by more than a few people.) It is a generic term and
    if someone wants to use it, I can't really stop them. As long it's not my drawings
    copied, pasted & repackaged or a large foundry piggybacking on my work, I probably
    wouldn't try either.\r\n\r\n@celeste The one used by the Walker Trust, Tobj\xF6rn
    Olsson's revival, Doves, is mentioned in my blog as I have said. It's never been
    commercially available. I stumbled upon it early on during my project & was considering
    not carrying on with mine, until I became more familiar with it. The below image
    from Olsson's PDF is a comparison with mine \u2013 it's very much of its time,
    around 1995 I believe. It appears to be auto-traced with some common features,
    the serifs mainly.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nRobert Green\r\n"
