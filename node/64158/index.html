  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

A first time for me on two accounts - first, being my post on Typophile and the other being font design. I've found reading the forums and articles to be very intelligent and constructive, so I'm hoping the response to my plea won't be an exception.

I've been working on this font for sometime, albeit on and off. Each time I return to the design I find a different flaw or a cause to amend it, so I thought it wise to put it out there for some insight in the hope I can actually finish it. As it stands there is only the one weight and lowercase and caps. You'll immediately notice an inconsistency with the S and the kerning is way off.

It was my intention to create a font which would lend itself to logo and headline design. Characterized by contrast between a light, slab-serif and heavy serif appearance combined. At this stage I'd like to invite comments/suggestions/an open critique, to help me see the wood from the trees.

Thank you in advance.

		<div class="commentbody">I like it! Just some quick thoughts (and I'm no expert):
I think your black dots disturbs the otherwise delicate features of your design a bit too much. I think you should try make them a bit lighter - either smaller dots or perhaps a hollow shape of some sort. 

Your H, A, and Q are brilliant imo - your M and f are quite original. The f is good - the M seems as if it needs some work. Your're right - the s seems a bit out of key with the rest I think. It gets too flat.

The 'leg' of the R seems as if it should go lower and not as flat.</div>

The thing that bothers me though is the black dots of the terminals. It is definately a character trait, but I don't think it really works as it is actually distracting from reading the word. It looks like a random collection of bulletholes shot through your typeface ;) It would be interesting to see if you can tone down these dots. 

This is a very geometrical typeface, which is a problem with letters like P, O, a & q. It makes these letters look stiff, and the a becomes more like a circle with a stick attached, than a letter. To make your typeface a lot more interesting I would try working away from this very strict geometry. As is often said about Futura, THE geometric typeface: It's not actually based on perfect geometrical circles, and it has a slight contrast, which makes it a lot more beautiful and interesting. Study the shapes of Futura and it will give you an idea how to improve your typeface.

Good luck.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Jeffrey. I'm more than familiar with Futura, so I'll be sure to look into it. Maybe a more suitable template to base it on is what is missing.

The whole 'bulletholes' dilemma seems to be rearing it's head a lot more than I anticipated, as to begin with this was admittedly my intended signature feature for this font! So you're right - this needs a rethink.

Thanks again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, I like it <em>because</em> its "random bulletholes"! :-)
That said, I find it lacks a bit of coherence in the shape of letters and in the placement of the dots. And, most importantly, the only way to see if the "holes" are a valid feature or just distracting would be to set some actual text with it.</div>
