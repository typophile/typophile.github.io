  body: My first thought was HVD Comic Serif, but the capital Y's were all wrong.
    Now I'm guessing Salvo Serif Black.

  body: "My mistake, I saw your tweet and went to the site, I hadn't registered yet,
    so it wouldn't let me see your attachment, I went off of the headline. It wasn't
    until I checked back I realized there was an attachment. \r\n\r\nNow that I can
    see it, The K is unique, edited in Illustrator I would guess, but for the base
    font? Cube OT-XExpd Bold from Font FF Cube (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/cube/ot-xexpd-bold/)is
    fairly close, it's not it. The bowls in the P's and m's aren't right. \r\n\r\nI
    found that This logo was created in 2007: \"Following the completion of a string
    of strategic acquisitions in the last couple of years the company in late 2006
    decided to iron most of its acquired brands into one single name\u2014that of
    Samskip\u2014as an updated corporate identity was launched\"\r\n(http://faroebusinessreport.com/abr07/070-071.pdf).
    \r\n\r\nLooking at the fonts embedded in Samskip's annual reports they are big
    on Univers, Futura and Helvetica. Pretty standard for business in general and
    Scandinavian design in particular. \r\n\r\nAlso, sure you saw this, it's the Samskip
    Style Guide, lots on what not to do and colors, sadly not on the fonts : http://www.samskip.com/Samskip/ad/\r\n\r\nFinally
    there is even a Flickr Photostream of North Sea Shipping company logos and marketing...
    people collect the most interesting things! http://www.flickr.com/photos/shortseanorway/with/5077609062/\r\n\r\nDon't
    know if any of that helped. Let us know if you figure it out! Hopefully someone
    else knows, now it's bugging me! Good Luck!\r\n "

  body: "Wow thank you - that was pretty amazing feedback... \r\n\r\nEven the company
    can't inform me - how uncool is that? They have bought another company and want
    me to do the existing logo in samskips typeface, only... they don't know what
    it is...\r\n\r\nGuess I have to to this manually. Cool with the FF cube and thats
    the second time I got that respond so I might use that for base...\r\n\r\nThank
    you again...\r\n\r\nAWESOME"
