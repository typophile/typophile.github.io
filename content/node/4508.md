body: Hola, just starting out with a new font idea, here&#39;s what I have so far,
  just some simple bezier curves in Illustrator.  Any feedback or ideas, there is
  a lot of work still to be done. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34495.gif"
  alt="MachineMan Curves"> <BR> <BR>Oh and great forums by the way!!!! I just found
  this site, and I&#39;m whiling away my lunch hour as we speak &#40;or as I speak
  rather&#41;

  body: Nothing here especially sings to me, and it could stand a little cleaning
    up, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s  <BR>worth tinkering with. I&#39;d start by thickening
    up the lines. It looks like your <b>i</b> has disappeared?  <BR>Maybe in making
    the graphic? <BR> <BR>Half of the bottom of your <b>s</b> is gone too. That makes
    it unique among this alphabet. &#40;The <b>c</b>  <BR>does it too, but at the
    top, so the theme isn&#39;t nearly as obvious, if you see what I mean.&#41; Do  <BR>you
    want to include more of that theme? If not, then I probably wouldn&#39;t apply
    the idea to  <BR>only one letter. I&#39;d either develop it more or eliminate
    it. <BR> <BR>The lower half of your <b>g</b> looks too deep to me, like it descends
    too far.  <BR> <BR>But then, I&#39;m a rank amateur around here. There are lots
    of other folks who have lots more  <BR>experience and critical acclaim for their
    work than I do.
