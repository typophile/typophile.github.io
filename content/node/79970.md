  body: 'Sample #2: [[http://www.dafont.com/1942-report.font|1942 Report]] looks thinner
    but the imperfections in some letters (B, E, I, M and S) appear to be identical.
    They might have added a stroke to give it a bolder look.'

  body: The first sample is from the [[http://hitsvilleuk.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bad-return.jpg|poster
    announcing the return of Big Audio Dynamite]] and I think the second one is something
    related to the same tour.

  body: "Riccardo: the \u201C1942 Report\u201D file downloadable at Simply The Best
    contains only the regular weight. That site shows always bold, italic and italic+bold
    versions of every typeface, even when only the regular weight is available. The
    extra weights shown are just fake <em>\xE0 la Microsoft Word</em>."
