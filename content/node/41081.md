body: "I have a couple OT fonts I've recently finalized that utilize the OT case feature
  for punctuation.\r\n\r\nRecently I've implemented and expanded my OT 'aalt' features
  (thanks to Typophile) using lookups with the 'salt', 'ss01' and 'titl' features
  to expand the range of access since not all UI's are created equally.\r\n\r\nI'm
  curious if there is any expansion of the 'case' feature similar to the 'aalt' feature
  that makes the 'case' feature easier to implement. I've noticed in Illustrator 'case'
  is only accessed via the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here use any other feature
  tag and lookups with 'case' to expand it's access with differing software interfaces?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: 'In Illustrator and InDesign the ''case'' feature is applied automatically
    when you apply "all caps" to the text. Maybe not obvious...  The same is true
    of capital-spacing: ''cpsp'' (not 100% sure about Illustrator here.) '

  body: Eric, correct me if I'm wrong, but these features are only applied if one
    specifically sets all caps as a display option, independent of the underlying
    character codes. If one simply types uppercase TEXT, these features are not applied.
    Is that still the, ahem, case?

  body: "Interesting\u2026 in my case, I have a grid based pixel style font (designed
    for print actually) that contains all lowercase characters except for the numerals.
    There are a handful of 'case' punctuation characters where positioning has been
    adjusted to work with the numerals. Thanks for the feedback."

  body: 'To reply to John:  yes, we aren''t examining the case of the letters, but
    only the text attribute that can control case -- it seems unlikely that a heuristic
    applied to some number of characters would correctly decide whether to use the
    default or ''case'' form (as if there was a single correct answer anyway). '

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nYes, I was using the case feature interestingly enough only
    for the numerals which are caps height. I had upper and lowercase characters early
    on until I decided to drop the upper case characters as what I perceived to be
    the 'essence' of the font was in the lowercase forms, yet I left the numerals
    at caps height\u2026 (unlike, Wim Crouwel's all lowercase Stedelijk font where
    the numerals are at x-height).\r\n\r\nInitially I only thought the case feature
    was accessed manually through the glyph palette then it was pointed out that the
    case feature is set when selecting 'all caps' in the character palette.\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: I'm sure it has occurred to you, but since only the figures are involved,
    you could probably achieve what you want using the calt feature (contextual alternates).

    all of the various OT features. I really only know what I have needed to know
    to do what I visualize, I'm learning new things quickly. I'll look into the calt
    feature, that would almost make more sense that way."

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nOne thing to remember is that \"calt\" is on by default, at
    least, in InDesign. That means whatever you write will be applied unless the comp
    takes action to turn it off. If you want the comp to have to take action to turn
    it on, put the same features in a stylistic set. They will have to turn it on
    before the substitutions are made.\r\n\r\nNot a huge burden on the comp BTW. If
    you base all paragraphs on one basic style, and turn on the stylistic set in that
    paragraph style, it will continue through all the paragraph styles based on it.
    And/or, it could, by action, be turned off in any paragraph styles the comp chooses.\r\n\r\nWhile
    this may in some ways violate \"proper\" code, in my mind the decision should
    be based on whether you want the substitutions on or off by default. Remember,
    I only know InDesign.\r\n\r\n"
