    at the basic characters, not the whole font.  \r\n\r\nYou'll need the WinAscent
    value a bit higher than the uppermost part of your tallest glyph, including diacritics.
    \  The tallest glyph is currently /A ring acute/ (Unicode 01FA) at 1085.  So,
    the WinAscent value for Gidole needs to be a little above that figure.\r\n\r\nThe
    WinDescent should be set lower than the glyph with the lowest node, which is currently
    /g cedilla/ (Unicode 0123) at -385.  However, this glyph is usually represented
    as a /g/ with something like a /comma/ on top.  See [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0123/fontsupport.htm|this
    page]] and click on the 'view' link alongside each font to see how they treat
    this character.   \r\n\r\nIf you change your /g cedilla/ to match those in that
    list, your /A ogonek/ will become your lowest glyph, with a node at -202.  You
    need to allow a little extra room, but enter the value as a positive one, not
    a negative one.\r\n\r\nAs for setting up the metrics in FontForge, I'm afraid
    I don't use it so can't be absolutely sure about the 'General' value you're referring
    to."

    That these figures are the same as em size plus the line gap is just a coincidence,

    circular, so moving the apex even more to the right is probably not in your interest.
    But the stroke still feels a bit wobbly to me, like perhaps the curvature of the
    upper right outer outline is too low, making the stroke locally too thin:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corr_5071.jpg]\r\n\r\n/8:
    I understand your goal, but the current /8 does not meet it in my opinion. The
    upper half looks larger to me.\r\n\r\nAs for the long s, I'm quite fond of it.
    In fact, I use it in the official orthography of one of my conlangs, Jovian. :o)\r\n\r\nOgonek:
    The stroke thins down on the bottom left diagonal, which breaks the monolinear
    feel of the font. If anything, the stroke should be slightly thicker there since
    it's a \"strong diagonal\" in pen rules."

    right side of the arch is wider than the left side (it isn't, but to my eye it
    looks that way) and that it would profit from moving the apex a bit more to the
    right. The stroke also still appears to me to be thinner at its 2 o'clock position
    than at its apex, probably because I intuitively expect a \"heavy\" diagonal there.
    \ The outer upper right curve segment could probably profit from a bit more outward
    curvature. \r\n\r\nAt small sizes, the shape looks quite good, though."

    the diagonal is as thick as I'll let it be since making it thicker makes it look
    too heavy.\r\nBut making it slightly thicker has definitely improved the look
    so thanks for the suggestion:)\r\n\r\nI'm still unsure about the /4 - I think
    it looks a bit narrow now and a lot of fonts have a /4 that is relatively wider
    - I'll probably leave it for now though.\r\n\r\nI'm not really happy with the
    overall shape of the /8 so I'll try to fix that now."

    The hard corner is at odds with the rest of the letters, the top counter is small

    to the stem. I would make the top slightly wider and the downward angle slightly
    steeper (bringing the central junction further away from the stem), and end the
    bowl's stroke farther away from the stem.\r\n\r\nI like Gidole Play a lot. I was
    going to suggest narrowing the /V/v/y, but I think you did that on your own.\r\n\r\nI'm
    wondering whether the diagonal curve at the bottom right of /a/d couldn't use
    a bit more curvature to fill out that gap where traditional typefaces would have
    a foot and/or an outstroke. Currently they look like they might tip over to the
    right.\r\n\r\nThe spacing still looks a bit uneven to me; look at the wide spaces

    a slight diagonal stress, with the top-left/bottom right parts of the curve being
    thicker than the top-right/bottom-left.  If you flip the /o/ before you start
    construction of the other letters, I think you'll find it easier to eliminate
    the 'flat' spots.\r\n\r\nI've made a rough mock-up to show what I mean.  The middle
    /n/ is my attempt and was made from the /n/ and /o/ from your most recent upload.
