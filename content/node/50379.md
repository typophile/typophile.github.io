    something new in CS4?\r\n\r\nI use a little workaround that is almost as fast
    as having only one style:\r\n<ul><li>set up two paragraph styles: one without
    indent (#1), one with indent (#2)</li><li>within the style options for #1, set
    the \u2018next\u2019 parameter to \u2018#2\u2019</li><li>select all your text
    and \u2018apply paragraph style #1 and then next\u2019*, via a right-click (control-click)
    in the paragraph style palette</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n*) I don\u2019t know how the exact

  body: "The simplest way to achieve this, in my opinion, is the good old-fashioned
    way. One paragraph style for your basic text style. Include a tab position at
    the first indent. Use a tab at the beginning of every paragraph except the first
    one. Seems unsophisticated, I know. But after years of trying to be fancy about
    it, I realized that simplest is best. \r\n\r\n-- K."

    work fine.\r\n\r\nYou can set the tab position in your paragraph style(s), so
    each time you hit the tab, you will get the indent. And of course, with different
    paragraph styles, you can have a different indent value. I frequently use 1 pica
    for a text paragraph indent, but 1 em (further) for an extract paragraph indent."

  body: "You know, when I started out, I thought \"tabs are for typewriters, we have
    computers now\" and I used to try to work with paragraph indents in styles. But
    that just led to a population of multiple parent/child paragraph styles. Not to
    mention the fact that I was constantly having to remove the tabs that copywriters
    and editors were putting in their copy (silly editors ;-). And then applying all
    these multiple paragraph styles. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, it didn't take long
    to see the error of my ways. Fancy-schmancy; simple is better.\r\n\r\nNow, on
    the off-chance that I get a manuscript without tabs, all I have to do is search
    for paragraph breaks and replace with  para break + tab. Then remove the few that
    come after a heading. Not too onerous.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: "Here I go again, getting into trouble. In my view, it is essential for any
    professional layout to be open ended, transparent and reusable.\r\n\r\nThe reasons
    for this are: the possibility of a reprint with corrections, a typesetter dying
    before second edition, etc. All pretty common sense, and obvious. Nothing really
    that could be called \"a time saver\".\r\n\r\nThe rule is simple and universal,
    eliminating all misunderstandings: no extra characters in files. <strong>Not one.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat
    has just been recommended above can be extended to hitting a return to start a
    new line, or return and any numbers of spaces to align a hanging indent in a list.
    Just that authors type a tab or five spaces in a row for indented paragraphs does
    not mean that we should keep them and forget how to use paragraph indents.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the original question, use two styles. One with no first line indent, and the
    other one with some first line indent. Then figure out a way to apply them simply,
    as has been suggested."

  body: This was another aspect of TeX that could be handy for very standardized documents.
    When you say in TeX that the style for every paragraph after a subheading will
    not be indented, TeX would just make it happen. If you're formatting standardized
    articles where this is always the case, it is a nice feature to have. I'm not
    sure why there is no "Force next style" option for paragraph styles in InDesign,
    which is I think what Zydrunas was hoping for. It's certainly one feature I miss
    from TeX!

    don't think you could do it from the find/change dialogue, but it should be possible
    to write a script to replace the style of any paragraph following a particular
    style. Clumsy, compared to a check box, but what are you gonna do? Probably someone
    from indesignsecrets.com would know how to write such a script. I've never tried
    writing one myself.

  body: "Sorry to be posting excessively here, but after some experimentation, I was
    able to formulate a compromised solution based on the video I linked to:\r\n\r\n1.
    Create your paragraph styles. For example a nonindented style called \"noindent\"
    and an indented style called \"indent\". \r\n2. In the options for \"noindent\"
    select the next style as \"indent\".\r\n3. For the \"indent\" style select the
    next style as \"same style\".\r\n4. Select all the paragraphs in a section for
    which you want this sequence to apply.\r\n5. Right-click (or option click) on
    the style called \"noindent\" and select 'apply \"noindent\" then next style'\r\n6.
    This will format all the selected paragraphs accordingly: the first selected paragraph
    will be \"noindent\" while the remainder of selected paragraphs will be \"indent\".\r\n\r\nThe
    reason why this doesn't quite solve the original problem is that it requires a
    person to manually identify sections before applying the style sequence. It answers
    the question in that it is still easier than formatting each paragraph individually.
    Ideally there would be a way to either identify sections to which style sequences
    (groups?) could apply, or a way to specify that for particular styles, the following
    style should automatically update itself to be the one listed as \"next\" style.
    (Persistent linked styles)\r\n\r\nAs for GREP, it seems that from within ID, it
    is only useful for character strings within paragraphs, and not relations of paragraphs.
    There might be a way to automate this feature with JavaScript, but on that I'm
    ignorant."

    Looks like Jan missed the significance of your your post as well. I guess the

    is set to \"same style\" as the next style, then it will apply that final style
    to all subsequent paragraphs in the selected text---the \"looping\" aspect, as
    Jan puts it. I hadn't gathered this significance from what you originally wrote.
