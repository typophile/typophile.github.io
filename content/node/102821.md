  body: "Really? I wonder then if they intended it to look clumsy? I rather like it
    myself. This is a publication from Bedford Press, which has close ties to Radim
    Pe\u0161ko, who I think designed this. He has a very interesting style and isn't

    very first thought. Try sending an email to him, he might answer."

    Look (really look) at the lowercase \u2018g\u2019 in Larish Neue. Why bother?"

    body: I'm looking man. It was one of the first things I saw. I appreciate it because
      I find it interesting when someone like Pesko decides to put some ugly/character
      into his work, especially in todays context where 'perfect' curves and proportions
      are achievable. It kind've draws some parallels with old specimens, where 'imperfections'
      were often due to technological issues i.e paper quality. Pesko's moves these
      into a stylistic area. Which I'm not opposed to. But it's ok if you are! :)
