body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI am trying to nail down the numeral set from old Volkswagen
  clocks.  These clocks would be 70's-era, found in Beetles and Microbus' (Type 1
  and Type 2, respectively).\r\n\r\nHere are two photos with the numerals in question
  (I believe the top photo is a newer version... either of these will work for what
  I need them for):\r\n<img src=\"http://www.andysapp.com/images/volkswagen-clock.jpg\">\r\n<img
  src=\"http://www.andysapp.com/images/volswagen-rare-68-70-vw-bus-in-dash-clock-gray-background_4745974.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAny
  help in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Thanks so much, friend!  I think you are right.  Bee will get me there.  I
    can at least modify it by hand to make it closer.  It doesn't have to be perfect...
    just ballpark, so THANK YOU!

  body: "Yes, Marcox is probably correct.  However, these are 3 dimensional objects
    the type is on. Any angles or curvature on the objects from aging or manufacturing
    or even the optical qualities of the glass could easily obscure the similarities
    and small differences between these two sets of numbers.  Only a physical inspection
    can say for sure.  \r\n\r\nSorry if I am  being two picky.  It is the engineer
    in me.  Actually, I just stumbled upon your forum through my search for a different
    kind of VW Clock.  I was looking for sites that sell VW <a href=\"http://www.greenwisdom.biz/p/c/hc/hub_cap_clocks.htm\">Hubcap
    Clocks</a>."
