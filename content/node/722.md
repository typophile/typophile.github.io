body: Hi everyone! I&#39;m new in this forum, and I hope the discussions can seriously
  contribute for my projects. <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m attaching a sample of a new displays
  typeface &#40;that don&#39;t have a name yet&#41;. <BR>What I&#39;m looking for,
  in the shape of these characters, is something innovative. Shapes unconventional,
  but still functional. <BR>I&#39;m a little worried about the letter &#34;A&#34;
  legibility. Maybe it&#39;s too much innovative. <BR>What do you think? <BR> <BR>thanks
  a lot! <BR>Haag<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13301.jpg"

  body: 'I would encourage you &#40;if you question it&#41; to develop alternates
    - why not retain the current glyphs &#40;spectacular, by the way&#41; and develop
    additional characters with more information and uniformity? <BR> <BR>Allow me
    to elaborate: your strokes are meticulously consistent, save for the upswing in
    the H, downstroke on the R and the convention on the S. However, I find all of
    these characteristics to be appealing. <BR> <BR>If you question it, design a more
    lexically complete group without &#34;missing&#34; pieces where the viewer would
    expect them to be. <BR> <BR>I wish you the very best with this project - <BR>

  body: Thanks Nathan! To develop an alternative version &#40;with gliphs more complete
    and legible&#41; is a nice solution. Thanks a lot! <BR>Also, thanks to you, Hrant
    for your welcomed opinion. <BR>Haag

  body: I love it, it has such a sleek feel to it. <BR> <BR>I could see it being used
    as titling to advertise airplanes or something like that.

  body: Very nice Fabio. I am new to Typophile as well, and am amazed by the quality
    of the work &#40;and people&#41; that I have seen thus far. I just stumbled here
    by accident this morning but hope to contribute some thoughts and ideas. <BR>
    <BR>The only letters that I seem to stumble across are the M, N and B. The M and
    N seem ordinary compared to the other letters. They don&#39;t have the same &#34;airy&#34;
    quality. Could they be broken somehow or do you think that would be awkward? The
    letter B seems sad to me. Could the center stroke mimic the letter E?  <BR> <BR>Anyhow,
    keep up the good work!

  body: Thanks Tom for your comments. <BR>Actually, they match with the suggestions
    from another typedesigner, my friend. <BR>Characters like N, M, S,... don&#39;t
    have the same expression as all the others. They need to be more opened and lighter.
    <BR>As you said, designing the center stroke more thin &#40;like &#34;E&#34;&#41;
    is a solution. I&#39;m working on it. <BR>I agree with you that B is looking weird.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m also amazed how this forum is a nice and helpfull resource for
    developing serious typefaces. Thanks for all of you. <BR>Fabio <BR>

  body: I like it a lot <BR>The A, C, and G arent optically sloping to the right as
    much as the rest of the characters. <BR>And the R looks shorter than the rest.
