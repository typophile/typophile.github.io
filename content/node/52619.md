body: "I'm using ITC New Baskerville at 11 points for the body of a bible-related
  study guide.  I want this guide to have a fresh, clean, professional look.  Originally
  I was torn between Mercury and ITC New Baskerville, and eventually opted for the
  latter when I saw it effectively used in a book.\r\n\r\nNow I need a good sans-serif
  font to be used for headers to compliment this work.\r\n\r\nI've been working in
  Word and was originally using Arial Black at 20 points.  But lately I'm totally
  turned off by the Microsoft licensed fonts.\r\n\r\nA professional logo was recently
  created for this work, and the designer used Neue Helvetica 73 Bold Extended in
  all caps for the logo.  So originally I investigated that font using both lower
  and upper case letters.  The headers in my book will use mixed case.\r\n\r\nThe
  width of Neue Helvetica 73 Bold Extended is nice.  But the white space in some lower
  case letters (like a, e, and s) is unsatisfactory.  I read the thread regarding
  Helvetica and Univers, and it seems the latter is favored by designers (http://typophile.com/node/33301).
  \ After comparing Univers 73 Black Extended with the former I agree that Univers
  is superior to Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I'm not married to any header
  font at this point.  The extended fonts seem to contrast nicely with ITC New Baskerville.\r\n\r\nThe
  qualities I'm looking for are:\r\n1. High contrast\r\n2. Readability\r\n3. Clean
  professional appearance\r\n\r\nPlease recommend some fonts that you think would
  compliment ITC New Baskerville. Thanks."

  body: I wonder about one of your requirements. The serif face you are working with
    is already high in contrast. Wouldn't it be a nice counterpoint to use something
    with little to no contrast?

  body: "How well do you think any of these would work as header text for ITC New
    Baskerville body text?\r\n* Antenna Black\r\n* Titling Gothic Normal Bold\r\n*
    Gotham Ultra\r\n* Akzidenz Grotesk BQ Super\r\n\r\nI like all of these.  Thanks."

  body: My personal opinion is that of these four options, Gotham (Ultra) works best,
    and Antenna Black works worst. Gotham Ultra might be a tad too black, so you might
    want to try black or bold and see what you think.
