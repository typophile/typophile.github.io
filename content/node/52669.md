  me how significant typefaces are and how dynamically they can promote certain emotions
  when used in advertising messages.\r\n\r\nI am in charge of a cosmetic clinic and
  have been in search of a font that is light, squared and has rounded corners, similar
  to Eurostile or NP Naipol (my favorite), for use as a corporate typeface, in order
  to promote the technological and scientific elements of our business. The problem
  is that the clinic is located in Greece, so this font will have to include Greek
  characters as well. The only such font I have managed to locate is Eurostile by
  URW.\r\n\r\nIs anyone aware of any other similar fonts that also include Greek characters
  or can point me to the right direction so that I can locate them myself easier (such
  as a searchable database with relevant search fields etc). \r\n\r\nThank you in
  advance for any help, I appreciate your expertise and knowledge.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAris
  Soul"
