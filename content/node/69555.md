  on the classical forms of \"BernhardSchoenschrift\", originaly designed by Lucien
  Bernhard  and \"Liberty\", designed by W.T. Sniffin for ATF in 1927, following the
  original designs from Lucien Bernhard. Well, our font have a extensive set of characters
  with many ligatures, stylistic alternate forms to the letters, open type solutions,
  etc etc. Created to work in the more important encondings (Central-European, Baltic,
  Turkish, Greek). However, because the natural difference between our countries (we
  lives in Brazil) - we have some difficult to find errors and omissions in the design
  of Greek characters. We thanks the support to show our errors and omissions here,
  by the the very important community of designers who speaks and/or create Greek
  letters in your fonts. Thanks by Paulo W\r\n\r\n"
