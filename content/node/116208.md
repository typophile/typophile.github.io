  body: "Grand Hall appears to be Nick Curtis's <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/k_l.htm'
    target='_blank'>Little Lord Fauntleroy</a> filled in.\r\n\r\nThe word 'The' appears
    to be something that was awkwardly made to curve around the G.\r\n\r\nEdit: I
    forgot that Little Lord Fontleroy filled in was <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/f.htm'
    target='_blank'>Fontleroy Brown</a>."
