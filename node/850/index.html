<div class=commentbody>Laurens Janszoon Koster?.

<div class=commentbody>Yeah. I can see what you mean, Mark. It does look like that face. It couldn't be me, I'm not that flamboyant. It also reminds me of another face (the non-swashy version) that came with TypeStyler when it first came out. But, I can't think of the name. Hmm. Where did you get this sample?

I've only ever seen Koster in that form. <br> <br>I remember it was part of the type library at a magazine publisher I once worked for. I could never figure out why it was chosen. I think some of the people in the typesetting department had different tastes than the art directors. We thought it was kind of a joke. I don't think anyone ever used it.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>...recent trends, the return to victoriana, it might be useful though?</i> <br> <br>Ugh. I hope not. I do appreciate and enjoy old Victorian design and typography, but it's so set in its time. It's difficult to do that style without it coming off as parody or ironic or nostalgic. On the other hand, I do think the Victorian spirit is alive and well every time I see design where style and form completely upstage the message.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know, that Victorian style seems to always be around in some form or another. In the sixties, it seemed to be equated with comedy, probably a reference to Vaudeville. Then there was the whole (ironic) counterculture/rock adoption of the style (Sgt. Pepper, <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine, etc.). I'm sure this sort of thing will continue to happen.</div>

Not much info, unfortunately, except that it originally came from MacKellar, Smiths, & Jordan type foundry. Although it's in the book, it's not clear whether it was actually a wood type.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Though theft and borrowing was fairly rampant among nineteenth century foundries, I doubt the Cleveland version is based on the MS&J. Bit more happening with the former. They usually don't clean up this well. Could very well be the inverse. Hate to call any of this stuff Victorian. What actually is that? I think you need to look at late eighteenth century French foundry specimen books to find the origins of many of the Anglo-American nineteenth century display faces.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant <br> <br>The specimen Mark showed are indeed the Koster Initials as orginally designed by William J Jackson for MacKellar Smiths & Jordan. Patent design 1888. <br> <br>This means that the initials you are asking about, with the Cleveland pinmark, are misidentified. <br> <br>Cleveland Type Foundry went from 1875 to 1892 when they were absorbed by ATF. Several catalogs were issued during this time period. <br> <br>In looking through the Bidwell book on the acquisitions of ATF I would guess, based on a showing of very similar initials from Cleveland that these are actually called the Euclid Series.

<div class=commentbody>So Gerald showed me this book of "lost" American metal faces (I forgot the title, but it was edited by Alexander Lawson, and published in 1981) and Marks' Koster was in there, as was... a face called Euclid (like Gerald said) by the Cleveland foundry which matches the font in question! It actually has a full alphabet with lc, and the stuff I've seen is the swash caps. <br> <br>However, I'm still looking for info on this font (so Euclid, not Koster) like <br>who made it, was there an earlier version, etc. Thanks for any leads! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The swash characters from Mark's specimen matches a specimen from a friend's personal collection of metal and Ludlow type. This was back in the mid 70s and I think he used to buy old type cases from out of business printers. His sample is marked Antique Initials No. 2, which was probably a drawer separated from the regular complement. It looks like a 48 pt. sample.
Sorry for the poor repro, my scanner at home needs reconfiguring, so I tood a quick snap instead. I can get a cleaner scan tomorrow if you'd like, but there's no information on the type source.

<div class=commentbody><em>(so Euclid, not Koster)</em>
So Hrant, is it info on Euclid that you are looking for?
Do you (or anyone) have a sample, because I have a sample of Euclid shown in an old CG specimen book and listed as a "Compugraphic Exclusive". This basically meant that it probably came from the collection of antique types they purchased from T.J. Lyons in Boston.
Does this match the Euclid you've seen?

<div class=commentbody>Nope, look at the "B" above:
http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/koster_b.gif
But please don't kill yourself tracking down more info,
we both have bigger fish to fry I'm sure*. BTW, what do
you guys think the market is for a CD with hi-res scans
of the UC set? I could picture how they might make for
some funky compositions (like using them as initial caps
in an otherwise "normal" paragraph, or as background
images) but I'm not sure if sales would be enough.
* OK Chris, that's your cue to start a pun volley with Norbert. ;-)

Just thought I'd see what it might look like.
Yeah, yeah, where are the individual type block outlines. Hey... just think of it as a logotype.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes Mark, they are. I didn't notice until you mentioned it.
Plus, I notice the cap S is different than your sample.
The specimen was pulled by a friend Jimmy Jacques for a little sample book of his collection around '79 or so.
(David, it's the Antique Initials 2 specimen above.)</div>

I see now! I was trying to look in your latest adventure into what the B would look like as an initial cap.</div>

<div class=commentbody>By the way, in these pre-Typophile-redesign discussions, some of the comments (by moderators I think) are missing, which makes me sound like one end of a phone conversation above. It'll be nice when (if?) these are restored.</div>
