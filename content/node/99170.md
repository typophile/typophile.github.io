  an old font beyond standard latin alphabet (A-Z). However, the font is originally
  in TTF format. I am wondering, after looking at the various pages on this site,
  is there a way of reducing the number of nodes in a OTF that has been converted
  from TTF without altering the shape of the glyph? I have seen \"Optimise\" and \"Clean
  up\" functions in FLS5 but they appear to alter the curves a bit. \r\n\r\nAlso when
  reducing the font from 2048 to 1000 em, what is the best way of doing it? Clean
  up everything first, then reduce, or reduce first, then clean everything up?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

    (PS), and TrueType (TT). The main difference between a TT font and a TT-flavoured
    OT font is the presence of OT look-up tables in the latter.\r\n\r\nMeaning? Unless
    you absolutely <em>need</em> the font to have the CFF flavour, leave it as TT.
    You and the world will be much happier."

    output ttf and cff compatible UFOs, reaching point-compatible ufos in each format.
    Compare the two, make whatever edits to the new cubic beziers you may find, and
    output a cff-ready OTF?

  body: The InDesign cursor scaling bug was fixed some time ago. However, we've found
    issues with some third-party PDF creators that assume a 1000 unit em for CFF fonts,
    and that mess up scaling and metrics. This won't stop us from producing fonts
    with higher UPM values if the details of the individual design require it, but
    it does mean that we try to stick to 1000 for PS fonts whenever possible.

    There are many typophile threads attesting to this.\r\n\r\nIIRC, the 1000 limitation
    applies to Type 1 fonts (pfb/pfm) but NOT to CFF OT fonts.\r\n\r\nAre there any
    known circumstances where a CFF OT  will fail if it has a UPM other than 1000?
    Six years ago Adam Twardoch said that InDesign assumes 1000 and uses a text cursor
    to match, so if the font has a UPM of 2000 the cursor would be sized at 50%.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Peter, much is going to depend on how the TTF outline looks to begin with.
    If a quadratic bezier outline has been fairly cleanly defined with on-curve points
    used only at extrema and where necessary, FontLab Studio -- Windows, at least,
    I've never tried the Mac version -- does a remarkably good job of converting to
    an accurate cubic (PS) bezier without introducing interpolated on-curve points
    between extrema. This illustration shows an original TTF outline and a converted
    PS outline; note that the number of cubic nodes is not affected by the number
    of off-curve quadratic points in the original:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttf2ps_6632.png]\r\n\r\nIt
    is as accurate in its preservation of curve quality as I think you can get given
    the fundamental differences in the mathematics involved. At typical type sizes,
    even at high resolution, these differences are smaller than the eye can discern.
    Here are the two outlines superimposed:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overlay_3822.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    the original TTF outline is less cleanly defined, then FontLab will tend to multiply
    the number of PS points, sometimes inserting them everywhere that the TTF off-curve
    points imply an intermediate on-curve point. The earlier FontLab conversion algorithm
    did this everywhere.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nDavid, I'd be interested in seeing some illustrations
    of the results of the two RoboFont options. I think I understand what you mean,
    but pictures, thousands of words, etc.."

    appear to alter the curves a bit.</cite>\r\n\r\nIndeed they do. But can you tell
    the difference? \r\n\r\nThe answer to that is mainly how you look for the difference.
    One way is to toggle back & forth with the glyph displayed at 256 points & watch
    things change. Yup, it's different.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to print out the characters,
    both the original ttf and the optimized .otf, using a laser printer, at, say,
    12 point (or whatever size will typically be used). Shuffle the paper & go home.
    Come in the next day, look only at the paper, and see if you can tell them apart.\r\n\r\nWe
    use to do this with loudspeakers, after raunchy stereo salesmen would try & tell
    us how much \"better\" the more profitable speaker system was. The \"we\" here
    is a couple recording engineers, who had far better ears than the salesman.\r\n\r\nSo
    the parallel for you, if you can't tell the glyphs apart, when used as they will
    be used, would be to get a type designer to critique the differences -- again,
    as used, not at 256 points on the screen, overlayed.\r\n\r\n(Loudspeakers? I use
    Magneplaners. There are better choices if you're into rock 'n roll with a lot
    of bass... Otherwise, plan on a lot more money...) "
