  not match any documents.</em>) with a piece of software that is called \"Smasher\"
  and is available here <a href='http://insidersoftware.com/SM.php'>http://insidersoftware.com/SM.php</a>
  (Mac OS X only)? Not that I would like to test it or even have the need for it,
  but i just stumbled over it on macnews.de \u2013 apparently it is new and some kind
  of utility connected to FontAgent Pro (which I also did not try). \r\nThey do a
  rather offensive presentation on their website (calling it \"smasher\" seems a little
  bit strong to me):\r\n<em>>Smasher solves your font integrity, performance and suitcase
  problems fast by unpacking old suitcases, cleaning up fonts, translating font formats,
  clearing font caches and displaying font properties and permissions. In seconds,
  with a few clicks, you can</em> [\u2026]\r\nPerhaps this is of interest for typophiles.
