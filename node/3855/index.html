When you have a small book, you hold it closer, and the type can/should be smaller. And when you have a large book, you lay it down somewhere, and the type can/should be larger. <BR> <BR>&gt; readability depends also on the reading habits <BR> <BR>Yes, &quot;familiarity&quot; is the second important component of reading.

A writing system with more regularity (e.g. less extenders) appears more legible, because our consciousness is foveal, and everything is clear. A writing system that's less regular (e.g. more extenders) is actually mroe *readable*, because things are less ambiguous in the parafovea. This is also why sans serif forms appear more legible than serif forms, but a book in sans is no fun to read. <BR> <BR>For example, Armenian is more readable than Latin, but less legible; the former is better for books, the latter better for posters. This is because of the difference in vertical information. <BR> <BR>Look at the far-right of: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; everything to the right of my nose is peripheral  vision. <BR> <BR>I think it might not be *that* bad, since the eyes are pretty close*, relative to the span of vision. I suspect your left eye can see about half what your right eye can see anyway. The issue of depth is more significant, but maybe not for reading? <BR> <BR>* Unless you're a rat. Did you know that rats have a blind area some distance in front of their noses? Very valuable information&hellip; if you're an insect.  :-/ <BR> <BR>Have you found that you tire quickly (compared to somebody otherwise similar to you) when reading a long book? <BR> <BR>&gt; I'd guess that the fovea would be smaller side-to-side <BR> <BR>I think the fovea would be about the same size, but the parafovea maybe 75% the size. <BR> <BR>From what I remember, there have been perception tests done on people with monocular (or highly lateralized) vision, but I don't remember any offhand. <BR> <BR>What I also wonder is whether there's a *cognitive* issue here, since each half of the brain does different types of tasks, and each eye shares half of its retina between them. There's a book called &quot;The Alphabet and the Brain&quot; which tries to show that reading rightward is inherently more efficient than leftward, irrespective of the writing system (which is related to this issue). I wasn't entirely convinced, but the foundation for the book (studies of lateralization of perception/cognition) is solid. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; How did that rule come about? <BR> <BR>More than a rule, it's a guideline. But actually, my statement was an over-simplification (probably my functionalist side having too much say - again&hellip;), and it depends on the kind of text. <BR> <BR>There is the raw text, then there's the &quot;atmosphere&quot; that the font conveys, and they have to be balanced. For example, in a coffee-table book about Paul Klee, it's sad, but nobody's going to read all that fodder, so it might make more sense to use a sans no matter how much text there is. But if you want to reduce obstacles to the absorbtion of textual meaning, serifs help. The reason is simple: they help meld letters into words. <BR> <BR>&gt; The right eye sees the word 1st <BR> <BR>Actually, the left halves of each retina see it first, and they both go to one side of the brain - I forget which&hellip; :-/  But there doesn't seem to be enough evidence to suggest that this creates an advantage for a certain direction. Do women read faster than men? Their brains are less lateralized. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&gt;Have you found that you tire quickly (compared to somebody otherwise similar to you) when reading a long book?  <BR> <BR>&gt;I don't think so, but how can one tell? <BR> <BR>I suspect it takes extreme vision problems to make reading tiresome on the eyes.  One of the most avid readers I know is legally blind and has to hold the book quite close to his face.  Now, he's not the fastest reader - maybe because his fovea has to make more jumps per line.  But I'm amazed he reads at all, when in fact he must be one of amazon.ca's best customers. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On readibility <BR> <BR>I am especially curious about the readibility of text when it comes to choose a sans serif or a serif face for the bodytext. It seems to me that to some degree, it is a matter of the art director's taste, excluding the obvious examples where anyone can find it hard to read a text regardless of the serif condition of the typeface. Do you guys know (especially Hrant) if there's a scientific study on readibilty, one that can actually provide sources of information and methodology of the process?  <BR> <BR>  I am somewhat opposed to the occasional discrimination toward sans serif for the running text of a publication, thinking that a study of the particular typeface involved in the design is more judicious than applying a general rule that might keep someone from conveying a message in a more direct way just because the general feeling is that sans serif will cause fatigue. <BR> <BR>   In a book by Rob Carter (Working with computer type, Rotovision SA, Switzerland ISBN: 0823064794) he says: &quot;Due to the horizontal movement created by serif typefaces, it was believed for some time that serif letterforms were more readable than sans serifs; however, readability studies have proved that there's little difference between them. Tracking for example, has a lot more importance than that&quot; (words might vary a little: translated form a non-english text). Unfortunately he doesn't elaborate on this point to fill us in on what his sources were. <BR> <BR>   Other than that I think that Hrant's research is interesting and I will be very curious to see more of it. Thanks for making it available to everyone, Hrant. <BR> <BR>Manuel</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is definitely the risk of &quot;discrimination&quot;. The trick is to say &quot;serifs help readability&quot; instead of &quot;serif fonts are more readable&quot;. A font like Syntax is certainly more readable than Lubalin Graph. <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily179.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily179.html">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily179.html</a></A> <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4129.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4129.html">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4129.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>The reason serifs help in readability (although they actually hurt *legibility*, since they confuse the individual letter-structures*) isn't because they guide the eye (through horizontality or anything else), it's simply because they help individual glyphs blend into boumas. <BR> <BR>* This difference in legibility and readability is central to a good understanding of type design, and it parellels the difference between contemplation and immersion, between display and text type, between consciousness and the subconscious, etc. There is certainly a lot of overlap between readability and legibility, but there is opposition too: you could say they're at a 90 degree angle. <BR> <BR>Also, the use of type is indeed more important, not least because there are more bad type users than type designers! :-)  No matter how readable a font is, bad setting can kill it. However, if one assumes good basic setting, the font's readability does become a factor. And anyway, anything else is outside the scope of the type *designer* to begin with&hellip; <BR> <BR>Readability studies&hellip; what can one say? Most are flawed, and even the good ones can't be taken as gospel. They end with a concluding paragraph (because that's the way formal science works these days - you gotta earn your grant, baby), and those never really make enough sense. Ignore the &quot;concluding&quot; stuff, look *inside*, and don't expect too much. Why is this the case? Because reading is friggin' *complicated as hell*! :-)  But honestly, if you spend enough time looking through a large number of individual studies, seeing if they're useful, exactly what they shed light on, etc. and you couple that to overall cognitive studies (like those of Herman Bouma), then you can start to see the model converging in your head, you start seeing the dark as a half-light. You start seeing that serifs help (and how they help), you start seeing that divergence helps (much more than the mainstream type designer will allow his aesthetic sensibilities to admit), and a bunch of other things. <BR> <BR>But hey, don't take my word for it, really! :-)  See what Javal, Ovink, Patterson &amp; Tinker, Bouma, Taylor, Spencer and others have found, and check out some lo-fi designs by Mandel, Tracy, Carter and other true master craftsmen (as opposed to &quot;artiste&quot;s), and chances are you can gain your own insight and teach us all some new things! It's esoteric, arduous stuff, but to me it's really a blast. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
