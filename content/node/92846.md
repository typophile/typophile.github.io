  body: "Audrey\r\n\r\nThe digital fonts used are UConnCondensed and UConnExtended.
    They are proprietary bespoke fonts created for the exclusive use of the University
    of Connecticut's athletics department.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for examples of
    the rest of the letters (to decorate a cake, for example),  you might try their
    two websites, uconn.edu and uconnhuskies.com.  It might also be possible for you
    to obtain authorization directly from the University.\r\n\r\nNote that the fonts
    themselves are basic and do not include things like outlining or the multi-color
    effects seen in the logo.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    permission? In the medium of cake, the level of detail isn''t that great anyway. '

    body: Nice suggestions of similarities. Another similar font could be a modified
      version of Armada Bold (regular or condensed). But good name of the UConn font.
      UConn Extended

  body: Folly, depending on how much you need to actually type set, I would even suggest
    using the illustrator pentool. The letter C seems to be quite simple - 12 points.
    You could do it in under a minute. ;)
