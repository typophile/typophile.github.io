  body: "Does your sample has something to do with Japan or Japanese fonts?\r\nI'm
    saying this because -strangely enough- the only glyphs I have found to look close
    enough to your sample, belong to the roman (latin) counterpart of some Japanese
    fonts.\r\nLook at the image bellow.\r\n\r\n#1 is your sample\r\n\r\n#2 is the
    Latin counterpart of many Medium Bold font families starting with \"A-OTF xxx\"
    by Japan foundry [[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27267.html|Morisawa & Company
    LTD]]\r\nExamples:\r\nA-OTF ZenGoN Std (Medium Bold)\r\nA-OTF WanpakuGN Std (Medium
    Bold)\r\nA-OTF TypelaboN Std (Medium Bold)\r\nA-OTF Shin Go Pro (M Medium Bold)\r\nLinks:\r\nhttp://typedia.com/explore/typeface/shin-go-pro/\r\nhttp://www.morisawa.co.jp/english/font/shingo.html\r\n\r\n#3
    is the Latin counterpart of FOT-NewRodin Pro (DB) by \"Fontworks Japan\" foundry

title: As I know as a complete typography beginner, it's a linear, sans serif Grotesk
  font type. But that's all I can say for the moment.
