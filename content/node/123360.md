  of fonts & while I though that I was well aware of all the basic ins & outs of hinting
  I have been encountering some information that casts doubt on this.\r\n\r\nIn short\u2026\r\n\r\n1.)
  What is the simplest & and/or most reliable way to inspect a ttf ot otf file & determine
  if it contains any hinting data?\r\n\r\n2.) What methods might I use to remove any
  and all hinting data from an otf or ttf font file?\r\n\r\nAt my disposal I have
  fontlab5, fontforge, fontographer & the latest adobe fdk.\r\n\r\nThank you all in
  advance."

  body: "Thanks for that bojev.\r\n\r\nI am aware of that one. & fontlab seems to
    indicate that there are no hints to remove. Autohinting is turned off etc. The
    main clue that I have that hinting data may still be present is the file size
    of the final otf.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest one, sure, absolute way to tell? \u2026or
    one sure, absolute way to remove all hinting data? say using the adobe fdk for
    example to delete such data directly from the otf.\r\n\r\nIf fontlabs \"Remove
    hints\" feature is thought to be 100% reliable then maybe I am just wrong. I've
    been reading the manual & reading info online. All signs point to absence of hinting
    data but I have some fonts here that have 20k - 60k of unexplained data so I'm
    still exploring. There are older copies of these same fonts that have smaller
    file sizes & I'm having trouble telling exactly why. Hinting data is just my best
    guess & may be a wild goose chase.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    -d\r\n    Strip off all hints without generating new hints. Consequently, all
    other hinting options are ignored. This option is intended for testing purposes.
    \"\r\n(pro - you can use .bat files)\r\nNormally I would use FontForge. "

  body: "So, what makes you so sure there is still hinting in the font? Just file
    size?\r\n\r\nAnother thing that can contribute to the size of a font file is kerning,
    which can be in both the 'kern\" table and the GPOS 'kern' feature."

  body: "Thanks for the ideas everyone.\r\n\r\nJust as an added fact: It's 100% certain
    that both the old & new otf files came from fontlab but the old ones may have
    come from 4.6 & new ones from 5.1 in these particular cases. Any known differences
    between those 2 versions that might be related?\r\n\r\n@ Thomas Phinney\r\nThere
    is one where the glyphs are significantly bigger in the new version but each font
    has the same number of glyphs in both old & new. There would be automatic, proportional
    scaling to the metrics done by fontlab\u2026 in any case I'll have a look at data.
    Good idea. Thank you.  To answer you question: I don't have any real reason to
    think there is hinting data hiding somewhere. In fact it seems pretty clear there
    is not. It's a shot in the dark.\r\n\r\n@Frode\r\nI will definitely have a look
    at that as well. Thanks for the tip"
