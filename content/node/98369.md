    Typophile, this you find worthy of mention? Or am I missing something?  Did you
    think you were going to get a free slab-serif font on Black Friday? Too much time
    on your hands? Better ideas?\r\n\r\nYou've made so many great contributions to
    Typophile. This isn't one of them."

  body: "Oops, sorry, riccard0.  My bad. If you misread tittle for title, as I did,
    it's not so obvious. No wonder I thought it was out of character for riccard0.
    And, yes, poor tittle!\r\n\r\nThanks, Jan! "

    referring to the brutal treatment the i-dot suffered in being squeezed between
    the two words.\r\nA feeble attempt at humor, I know. \r\nNext time I will try
    to remember my smileys! :-)"
