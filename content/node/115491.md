body: "I have been trying to find out what font's are being used in the newspaper
  from the movie. It seems that the logo mast head is a combination of two different
  gothic typefaces. For Caps it is Old English Text MT and for the lower case letters
  it looks like Muenchner Fraktur. I can't seem to find out what the other headline
  fonts are. I especially would love to find out what this font is (see attached).

  body: "Based on an early 1900's typeface called, in the West anyway, Arrowhead.
    Digitally, see Jordan Davies <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/lettres-angulaires/'
    target='_blank'>Lettres Angulaires Semi Bold</a>, Intellecta's <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/gotica-moderna/'
    target='_blank'>Gotica Modern</a> and Dan Solo's <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/fletcher/'
    target='_blank'>Fletcher</a>. The latter appears to be the font used. Per Dan,
    the original was \"from the French foundry of Beaudoire & Cie\".\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I wonder if the name Fletcher was a play on Arrowhead. Fletch means to add the
    feather to an arrow."

  body: "Good find Mike. BTW \"fletcher\" is the occupational name for an arrowsmith
    or seller of arrows. Dan X. Solo probably felt that he had a real find when he
    bought a font of type that was based on a font \"from the French foundry of Beaudoire
    & Cie\". A change from all the ATF fonts of type that he would usually find on
    his buying trips. I have no further information on the French original other than
    the statement by Dan X. Solo. Of the available digital versions, I am somewhat
    inclined towards the quality of the version by Character {Herbert F. Van Brink}.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wes Anderson is noted for his quirky approach to film making and an obsession
    with detail. The press info cited by Fiver refers to his interest in selecting
    typefaces and mentions Archer, by H&FJ. Wes Anderson may have chosen Arrowhead/Fletcher
    for the death notice as because the name fits his Archer theme -- a secret irony
    -- rather than its intrinsic strength as a blackletter. \r\nDon"

  body: "Wow Thanks to everyone for the additional background info on the fonts. \r\nMike,
    That's Fletcher alright. What grabbed my attention about Fletcher is how the arrows
    blend seamlessly with the black letter serifs. When I saw the newspaper flash
    in the movie my eyes where drawn to that font. I couldn't find out why this black
    letter looked so unique. It is was really surprising to see that fletcher looks
    modular and geometric for a typeface made in 1865. Way ahead of it's time in that
    regard.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_(typeface)\r\n\r\nFollow up question.
    I may be pushing my luck on this post but do  you know what the headline font
    \"Will There Be War?\" is in the newspaper?  http://www.papermag.com/uploaded_images/budapesthotleNewspaper.jpg"

  body: "The headline font is definitely some version of Cheltenham. Giveaway is uppercase
    A. The headline could be ITC Cheltenham Condensed, but the mixed case \u201CTanks
    at Frontier\u201D is some other (older) version with lower x-height. No version
    on MyFonts.com seems to show \u201CTanks at Frontier\u201D correctly."
