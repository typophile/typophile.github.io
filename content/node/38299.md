  body: I'm still on InDesign CS [1] so maybe there's something since then, but as
    far as I know the background of a document has no colour until you put a text
    or other box on it and make that some colour. If you want all pages to be a certain
    background colour, you could put the boxes (frames) on the master pages. There
    must be a way to do this with layers too.

  body: One thing that baffles me about InDesign is that they have a swatch for "None"
    which is obviously no color, and then a swatch called "Paper" which is also no
    color but seems to want to be white, although you can change it. It's different
    from the None swatch because it's opaque, hence white. I don't understand why
    they don't just call it "White". You can't modify the Black swatch, it's just
    black, but you can modify this Paper swatch. You can also create a similar no
    color swatch and name it White for simplicity's sake.

    automate that?

  body: I'm really not at all clear what you want to do, but can't you create a "character
    style" with your background color and apply it thru the Character Style pane?
    What background color are you referring to - the page background or the background
    of the text box?

  body: "If you make a little text box of the height you want it, make it the background
    colour you want, and make the text in it the same style as in your document, you
    can paste it into your document (with the text tool selected) wherever you need
    this highlighted text. Then in this little box type the word or words required,
    and adjust the length of the box as necessary (easiest if you centre the word
    horizontally in the box). You'll have to shift the box down (it pastes in on the
    baseline) and adjust the text in it if necessary using baseline shift. The highlighted
    box will move with the text if you reflow it, though it won't break for a hyphenation.
    You can copy and paste the box to other places and replace the words.\r\n\r\nA
    bit cumbersome I know. If you know there won't be reflow, just put a coloured
    box behind the word(s) you want highlighted.\r\n\r\nThere's gotta be an easier
    way!"

  body: It looks like the character style pane allows one to specify the fill and/or
    outline colour of the character itself, but not of its background (at least in
    InDesign CS[1]).

  body: English is not my native language. Forgive me if I was unclear. Gary Long
    describes what I'm trying to do. Until now I've just placed a box behind the words
    I want to highlight, but when you're working with large projects it just takes
    to much time.

  body: "There\u2019s a simpler workaround: Create a character style with an \u2018underline\u2019
    (I don\u2019t know how this option actually is called in English, but I hope you
    get the point), adjust its stroke width (full line-height or what you want), and
    its position (shift it upwards). Additionally, you then can assign a shortcut
    for this character style, and there you go.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m on CS2, but this should
    work in CS1 aswell."

    you (usually) don\u2019t print white.\r\nYet, you always have a paper (or surface)
    to print on. So, in case you\u2019ll print on coloured paper \u2013 be it yellow
    or light blue, you name it \u2013 you already can get a better impression, without
    having to create an extra coloured box in the background \u2026"

    I've read of that trick before to do something similar. But now I'm going to write
    it down so I'll remember!

  body: Patty - None allows you to reveal objects beneath the object in question.
    A stroked frame without a fill, for example. If you picked Paper for that fill,
    you wouldn't reveal what was beneath.

    words in a text box. The underline trick is sweet. I'm actually surprised there
    isn't a \"highlight\" feature though. For as little as I use strikeout or underline,
    you'd think it be easy to create a simple customizable feature like \"highlighting\".\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the title of this post should be changed to reflect the content, \"background-color\"
    is confusing and for anyone searching for how to highlight in InDesign, this post
    probably won't come up. "

    it would be quite easy. \r\n\r\nIsn't there an invisible box around each character
    that determines: leading, tracking and other character changes? If you apply the
    highlight to that invisible box (in essence making it visible) then if you change
    any qualities of that character such as size, leading, tracking or offset, the
    highlighting will automatically change with it. And Underline and Strikeout prove;
    it's easy to apply character specific, manually augmentable features. \r\n\r\nI'm
    just speculating of course. Either way, you'd still have to manually tweak the
    end result to really get it to perfection."
