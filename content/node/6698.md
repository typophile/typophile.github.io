    is near perfect.

  body: I found it. Nick Curtis&#39;s free &#39;Hobbyhorse&#39;. &#40;See sample below&#41;.
    Nick usually bases his on revivals or old typefaces, sometimes mixing styles.
    The numerals look like Poor Richard, but some other letters look like they have
    other sources. You can find this font using <a href="http://www.fontseek.com"
    target="_blank">Fontseek</a>, or contact me by e-mail for the site where I found
    it.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49079.gif"

  body: Thanks Mike for the link with the notes and other background info. That is
    the sort of stuff I like learning about fonts that are not fully original works.
    I know Nick gives such notes on his commercial fonts, but hadn&#39;t found it
    before on his freeware fonts. I knew that typOasis had Nick&#39;s permission &#40;that&#39;s
    where I got my font&#41;, and so does <a href="http://www.fontfreak.com/authors/nick_curtis.htm"
    target="_blank">Font Freak</a>, and maybe at leastone other site, but because
    of the issue about other fonts that might, or might not, be at such sites, I decided
    I would give a more indirect route to the locations. On reconsidering I think
    these sites are worth knowing about, so I added the other link I knew about. The
    site owners have been helpful to me and my Guides, and I think they are responsible
    in the way they present their collections.

  body: My word. I hesitated to lay query at first--for fear of embarrassment--though
    now I am found in a state of glee for the wealth which has been presented. Thank
    you each and every one.
