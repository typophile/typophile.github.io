    to make his real signature public due to worries about identity theft?

    very much. The Hancock is spectacular.\r\n\r\nI am, as ever, bemused by the graphologist
    commentary on Lew's signature. After all these years, the total failure of graphological
    analysis in any controlled testing still has not managed to sink that ship."

  body: "Yes, it\u2019s brilliant and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but rather presumptuous!
    \r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid I must disagree with the premise that, \u201C\u2026he
    may need training if he wants a signature that will stand the test of time and
    popular opinion.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s irrelevant. One\u2019s signature is
    one\u2019s signature, and the only thing that really matters when it\u2019s put
    on of\uFB01cial documents is authenticity; therefore, the key issue is whether
    it can be easily forged.\r\n\r\nI suspect that popular opinion may be against
    his signature because people believe, mistakenly, that it is not suf\uFB01ciently
    signature-ish, in the sense of being authentic\u2014they think \u201Cit\u2019s
    just loops, anyone could do that\u201D \u2014like the argument against modern
    art, \u201Cmy kid could do that\u201D. However, I don\u2019t believe that anybody
    <em>could</em> do it, at least not to the same standard, applied to \u201Cnormal\u201D
    signatures, that would deceive an expert who can identify a personal style. (Nothing
    to do with graphology.) Even if he doesn\u2019t always execute it with the same
    number of loops, the style is unique, <em>le style, c\u2019est l\u2019homme.</em>\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    does the signature indicate a lack of gravitas? Will he be like Zuckerberg, coming
    to work in his pajamas? John already answered that\u2014graphology is a pseudo-science.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    altering one\u2019s signature to curry popular favor is dissembling, not a desirable
    quality in a public \uFB01gure.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signature_6348.png]\r\nNWS"

  body: I never did master my signature. It looks different every time, and I can't
    even write it that fast. Reproducibility and speed seem to me the most important
    elements of a signature. Seems to me Jack has already got it nailed.

  body: "My signature is often illegible, but it contains the actual letters in my
    name, just written quickly. The loops that Jack Lew uses seem totally abstract;
    the equivalent of signing with a distinctive \"X\".\r\n\r\nI still think it's
    conceivable (although probably unlikely) that he invented an abstract \"public\"
    signature, to avoid using his real signature on public documents. I was a victim
    of identity theft last year when someone opened bank accounts in my name and ran
    up thousands in debts. Somehow the crook knew my social security number, etc.
    Fortunately I was able to prove it wasn't me, but it was a real nightmare for
    a while."

  body: "Well yes, any attempt at a forgery is a forgery, irrespective of the skill
    with which it\u2019s done!\r\n\r\nBy easy, I meant one that doesn\u2019t take
    a lot of skill to convince people that it\u2019s authentic, in other words one
    that confounds close inspection by discriminating eyes.\r\n\r\nSo it doesn\u2019t
    make sense to say that a bad forgery can convince people, because the proof of
    the pudding is in the eating, therefore a bad forgery that convinces people is
    a good forgery!\r\n\r\nWhat you are saying is that a speedily and con\uFB01dently
    written forgery can convince, even if a close study would reveal that it is by
    a different hand. \r\n\r\nThere appear to be two levels of discrimination:\r\n\r\n1.
    Whether the reader is taken in by a quick glance\r\n2. Whether the reader is capable
    of distinguishing authenticity by closer inspection\r\n\r\nCertainly, any old
    signature, con\uFB01dently rendered, will fool many readers (1), but what interests
    me is whether loopy Lew\u2019s signature can be easily forged (both by skilled
    and unskilled writers) to deceive a close inspection by discriminating eyes (2)\u2014forensic
    typographers, in fact!"

    same classic problems that any forger encounters (uneven speed and pressure, pen
    lifts, hesitation, etc). Might be easy to fool the average person but probably
    not the expert.\r\n\r\n(I'm assuming that his loopy signature is consistent over
    time, and not just a random series of loops that is written differently each time.)"
