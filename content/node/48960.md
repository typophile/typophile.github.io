    versions of commercial fonts. Are you going to work for free in your professional
    career? Your profile says you love design, but apparently not enough to respect
    the work of type designers. :^/\r\n\r\nI'll let this pass for once, but next time
    your @$$ gets booted off Typophile. This is a first and final warning all in one."
