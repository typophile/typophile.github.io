  contains an elaborate timeline history of the manufacturing of letters. Visitors
  are walked through the foundry era, which reaches back 500 years. A guide explains
  the transition to mechanized hot-metal typesetting. The tour includes explanations
  of Linotype, Monotype and Ludlow linecasting machines. Along the tour route the
  next exhibit features a Monophoto and an Intertype Photosetter, machines which attempted
  to use linecasting technology to transition to phototypesetting, only to fail in
  competition with the electronically-driven phototypesetters. The display includes
  strike-on typesetters, machines designed to produce inexpensive type which could
  be married to the expanding offset printing market. The story line then drifts to
  phototypesetters, where Massachusetts hi-tech companies played a dominant role.
  The last chapter of this type story is digital. This story is told in a room paneled
  with bright digital prints output on a modern large format printer.\r\n\r\nThe [[http://www.museumofprinting.org|Museum
  of Printing]] has the largest collection of printing history. There are more phototypesetters
  than any other location, plus collections that are unrivaled \u2014 like the entire
  set of drawings for every Mergenthaler Linotype Company hot metal typeface and the
  100,000+ piece Frey Collection of ephemera from a century ago.\r\n\r\n800 Massachusetts
  Avenue, North Andover, MA 01845"
