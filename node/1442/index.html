<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>David, <br> <br>I've started a new thread on this subject so I can't be accused of hijacking someone else's. <br> <br>Now that I've thought about it for a whole day and looked over all the Heller texts I have hanging around at home, I can rationalise my feelings to a certain extent. <br> <br>In a nutshell, then, I don't like it when a prolific and respected writer abuses his or her position and disseminates their own prejudices/political agenda disguised as critical writing. <br> <br>This extract from Heller's <i><b>Designing Hate: Is There a Graphic Language of Vile Emotion</b></i> takes the biscuit as far as I'm concerned: <br> <br><i>German Fraktur type (as opposed to other medieval gothics, such as Old English) still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!, and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look.</i> <br> <br>I'm sorry, but this is pure propaganda. He should be ashamed of himself for publishing it. Or maybe the publisher should be ashamed. <br> <br>Anyway, this sort of thing coupled with the tripe in his Swastika book have most definitely turned me off his work. <br> <br>Matha</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>You should read his encapsulation of Lebanon's 17-year civil war in his review of the book "Beirut's Memory" in the previous issue of Print. I wrote a letter to Print as a result (my first ever to them), and they'll be publishing it - probably with some "last word" rebuttal by Heller tacked on. <br> <br>Although in an email exchange (that ensued as a result of my letter) Heller ended up telling me "we are not on opposite ends of the political divide", I can't read his mind to know what that really means. <br> <br>Some more "context" here <br><a href=http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup_v2/archives/001291.html#001291 target=_blank>http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup_v2/archives/001291.html#001291</a> <br>especially in the comments. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

It's not very clear. And I like his use of the pasive <i>my books are written...</i>. Acknowlegement of his many researchers, perhaps. <br> <br>and this is very interesting: <br> <br><b><i>Whatever strikes my fancy seems ripe for something -- article, book, dance, e-mail conversation. I try to find the story in whatever I'm interested in. Telling stories is very important.</i></b> <br> <br>He describes himself a curious explorer who writes down his impressions about subjects he's interested in. Totally at odds with his international reputation as a discerning critic of graphic design. <br> <br>Definitely nice context, Hrant. <br> <br>Matha <br> <br>PS what did he say about the Lebanon? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>does anyone who has been paying attention still consider Heller a critic or historian?</i> <br> <br>apparently so. He's called a critic or historian everywhere I come across his name. His books are heavily disguised as criticism/history.

<div class=commentbody>Heller, the person, overall: I think he's more of an asset than a liability. <br> <br>But - big but: <br> <br>> Have you ever heard of jewish (yes, Heller is <br>> jewish, so am I) people making propagandist <br>> statements of the swastika? <br> <br>All the time. And for very good reason: it's a superb graphic symbol of the Enemy, hence very useful to keep reminding people to be nice to the [erstwhile] Victim. <br> <br>I wish the Turks had such a symbol that we Armenians could use. It can even be argued (based on speeches Hitler made) that the Holocaust wouldn't have happened if we Armenians had such an enemy symbol available and had used it as effectively as the Jews use the Swastika. On the other hand, media wasn't nearly as good as brainwashing and manipulation as it is now. <br> <br>So in a way I understand the Jewish desire to keep it Evil, but I can't stand the duplicity necessary in applying it (even though it's part and parcel of such propaganda), I guess because Jews aren't the underdogs any more. Now they have an underdog, who I guess are in turn lucky to have the Star of David as a symbol with as much potential as the Swastika! :-/ <br> <br>But what really riles me up the most isn't the Swastika treatment, it's the blackletter blacklisting. It is a violation of venerable typographic culture to subjugate blackletter to the Jewish cause (no matter if you think the cause is just or not) the way is done with the Swastika. Leave blackletter alone, so that it may flourish again. <br> <br>> To me it just takes big balls to tackle <br>> such a project and face the consequences. <br> <br>What the hell are the consequences when all you're doing is catering the existing power structure?! What would take balls is to publish a book saying the Swastika is socially maligned, that it needs to be give a new chance. <br> <br>Same with blackletter. <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/11682.html target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/11682.html</a> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with you Hrant, about blackletter. It has a heritage <br>and an aesthetic that doesn't deserve to be forever usurped <br>by the Nazis. That said, it will be a very, very long time <br>before you see major corporations, large organizations or <br>governments use it. And who could blame them?

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>"Brian, Disneyland uses blackletter. But apparently good ol' Walt was white supremacist anyway." <br>.... <br> <br>Probably a case could be made easily supporting that. I have heard Walt hated children. But then some don't think much of us "old people". <br> <br>Hrant, I am teasing! <br> <br>But, <br>..... <br>German Fraktur type (as opposed to other medieval gothics, such as Old English) still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!,and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look. <br>....... <br> <br>The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!,and JUDE! <br> <br>Well, if you look at these words they don't look overly pleasant in Sans Serif either!???? <br> <br>His opinion, his problem. <br> <br>Usage outstrips form. Earlier I mention propaganda. Later about that! For me Fraktur has nothing evil embodied in the forms themselves. Many words are ugly no matter what the type face. <br> <br>Especially, cough cough, in bolds. <br> <br>"Heller" for instance "evokes" something that could be ugly in itself. It does not have a Polly Anna look to it. <br> <br>For instance, HELL, HELLER and HELLIST. Think about it? <br> <br>By the way, when you have multiple Zerox copies, are they called Zeroxies, or Zeroxen? <br> <br>I suppose it is always easiest to blame the medium rather than the messenger. I remember my great distaste for "Pastonchi", not the "nuts", the "type face". Thought it was a "Bread Truck Typeface". Then Dave Farey sent me a copy of a book set in the face, one word, "beautiful". I have like bread trucks ever since! Not many around these days? <br> <br>Fraktur has thorniness in form. I am surrounded by it in Finnish bookstores. Thorns are certainly a respectable fence. My past life gave me a great deal of time gardening. Most thorns evoke in me a sense of raspberries, blackberries and even the "lonely rose has thorns". <br> <br>Gardening, bread trucks and typography, there you have it. <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just as the Confederate 'Stars and Bars' flag is still offensive to African Americans as a symbol of slavery, the Nazi flag, with its central swastika will always be offensive Jews as the symbol of a regime that chose to murder nearly half of the Jewish population in the world simply for being Jewish. <br> <br>Of course, within the context of a Hindu temple (where I believe the symbol is not in a circle and normally 'rotates' other way) it is ancient and not offensive. <br> <br>In the West the Nazi swastika is kept alive not by Jews. I have never seen it in any Jewish literature, excepting that on the history of the Nazi period. Where you do see it is with those hate groups who like the Nazis, and in Arab political cartoons - where it is regularly pasted on Israeli leaders and the Israeli flag. I don't think they mean it as a compliment. <br> <br>The infamy of the Nazi period tarred the swastika for at least a hundred years. Those who use it in the West offend Jews, and know it and don't care. <br> <br>Fraktur is a different matter. I agree that it is not rational (though understandable) to identify it with the Nazis, and it should not be taboo. <br> <br>As to brutal symbolism, I don't like it, but it is not an identifying mark of Naziism like the swastika. <br> <br>I dislike brutal symbolism for the same reason I dislike speech filled with anger.

<div class=commentbody>William, <br>"Just as the Confederate 'Stars and Bars' flag is still offensive to African Americans as a symbol of slavery, the Nazi flag, with its central swastika will always be offensive Jews as the symbol of a regime that chose to murder nearly half of the Jewish population in the world simply for being Jewish. " <br>....... <br> <br>You have a good heart. I know that. You do, I see it in your writings. <br> <br>Naturally you are aware that many American blacks find Jews offensive because of their systematic participation in the slave trade? We have not stopped eating bagels though have we? <br> <br>Further more what happened to the North American Indian? But we have not given them back their land, have we? Oh, land, but, but, that's much more than a symbol? <br> <br>Few people are aware of how many Indians lived in America when the white man came. Few know that the white man used biological warfare on them. And some democracy! I am not sure when the Indians were even allowed to vote. In Canada it was the fifties. Possibly the Canadian Indians got to vote earlier than the American Indians. <br> <br>Anyway, how many Indians do you figure there were? Lots! Far more than half of them were killed. So lets not talk so much of symbols. They are not evil. Mankind is evil. Lets get back to the Palestinians, or the Jewish "state". Heller seems to have much time on his hands. He should do something constructive such as identifying good from evil. The Palistinian question is a short study. But if he simply does not like Germans he should just come out and say so. <br> <br>Maybe he is a racist, anyone asked? <br> <br>Furthermore the Swastika has great meaning to other cultures. Also it has great meaning to the European cultures. I am not so sure that it should be "swept under the table". It is offensive to many and it should be. But symbols don't kill people, people kill people. So given Heller's logic we should get rid of people. <br> <br>Those are the issues that should be dealt with, as Henry Kissinger states, the "National Psychiatric of Cultures". The swastika should remain hanging in every household as a reminder of how terrible man is to each other. Frankly, I do not think things should be forgotten in 100 years, if ever. <br> <br>Furthermore, most of those illustrations, particularly the first set that Matha exhibited are indeed just plain ugly. They are offensive just because they are. Ugly! <br> <br>But I could design a swastika that is beautiful and meant as such. Not only that but I would have spiritual justification for doing so. I could also print a beautiful book in Fraktur. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>The Nazis murdered huge numbers...</i> <br> <br>but not just the Nazis. People all over Europe took advantage of the situation to kill their Jewish neighbours. Some Jews we're killed in Poland after the war when they were released from concentration camps. In Ireland there was a pogrom in 1904 and we took advantage of our war of independence and civil war in the 1920s to disappear all sorts of people who didn't fit into the new nationalist scheme of things, Jews included. <br> <br>Focusing on the Nazis alone lets the rest of us get away with murder.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Focusing on the Nazis alone lets the rest of us get away with murder. <br> <br>For goodness sake, Matha (and Giampa) I didn't say that the Nazis were the only ones who have done bad things. I thought Nazi symbols and things wrongly labeled Nazi symbols (Fraktur) were the topic here. <br> <br>Condemning one evil does not excuse or condone others, whether done by Irish, Americans, Jews or anyone else. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Shirley,It doesn't matter what the swastika meant before it was used by the nazis? <br> <br>It's a brand manager dream come-true; <br>You invest time and money in a brand, take good care of PR etc, and you have a brand value that lasts ad infinitum. <br> <br>It could have been the swoosh. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>David, What Matha has read or not read doesn't change the truth (or falsity) of what he is saying. <br> <br>Can you summarize what the books that you mention say on the issues here? I am interested. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>William, <br> <br>sorry. since he studied history. ans since - i guess - he is teaching history - you can't just post "Steven Heller and Prejudice" without knowing the real history of the Swastika!!!! <br> <br> <br>and he didn't post, let's say : The Swastika and Prejudice. <br> <br>and then compare what Heller wrote. What Quinn wrote. etc. etc. and then. and only then - we all can learn about the issue. and REALLY talk about prejudice!!!! <br> <br> <br>[if you want i can email you about the books - but not here] <br> <br> <br>David Hamuel</div>

<div class=commentbody>The "real" history? I don't claim to know the real history of anything, David. <br> <br>And are you the same David Hamuel who was posting yesterday? The prejudice in question is mine. Remember? "Irrational prejudice against Steven Heller"? Ring any bells? <br> <br>And please stop repeating yourself. <br> <br>Matha. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>not here <br> <br>Why not? <br> <br>I think everyone posting here would be interested if these other books have something that sheds light on the swastika and prejudice, whether against the swastika or against Heller's judgment on it. </div>
