  body: "BUZZ! Incorrect . . . The REAL name of this font is Ricky Nelson which was
    offered exclusively by Andreson Typesetting on the west coast of America . . .\r\n\r\nAt
    their heyday they had over 14 shops on the west coast and as part of their offerings,
    they released an exclusive line of typefaces . . . Among these was Bel Air originally
    designed by Clive Piercy and digitized by Robbie De ViIlliers later from Wilton
    Type . . .\r\n\r\nThere is a digital version of Ricky Nelson currently in the
    works (not by me) that will be released in the coming months and finally put an
    end to this obscure font ID . . .\r\n\r\nBTW, it HAS already once been digitized
    and offered under the name Designers, no credit is visible in that version . .
    .\r\n\r\nStuart"
