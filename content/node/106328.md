  my first ever typeface endeavour. Please tell me what you think of it. So far I've
  traced my pen drawings in fontlab without a lot of further adjustment. I would like
  to keep (some of) the irregularities (the inconsistent serifs for example) as part
  of the font's character. What would this need to become a useful, playful typeface?\r\n<img

  body: 'I think for this to become a useful typeface, you need to work on achieving
    more even colour. In type terms, this involves not having any letters pop out
    as being much bolder or "darker" than the rest, nor any "lighter", nor should
    parts of the letters stand out in an unbalanced way from the rest of the letter.
    Try for that one round, if you want, see if you can do it without losing character. '
