  body: "Is this for an early 1980s metal revival band? if so, don't change a thing.
    Actually, make the 'ER' look more like 'ER', but that's it.\r\n\r\nIf it's not
    for a rock group, then I'd reconsider the treatment.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Just kidding. Seriously though if you want interlocking letters attempt to
    draw it by hand with a pen and see where that gets you. This angular blade-like
    thing has so many issues that don't allow it to work well as a logo.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you got carried away thinking about how you would handle it in After Effects or
    Maya. Try to make a solid mark first. \r\n\r\n"
