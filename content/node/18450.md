  that follows a conference on architecure, called \"On Growth and Form\" (after D'Arcy
  Thompson's book) and I'm looking for a font that would fit the idea. I was thinking
  of Mrs. Eaves because of the ligatures ... but, well I'm an architect, I don't know
  that much about typography, so any help will be very appreciated. I'm looking for
  something a little bit organic but not very loud that would bear a resemblance to
  subject of the book ... hmmm ... I guess I don't know the adequate graphic design
  language. Anyways thanks!"

  body: You are looking for an archetypal [Modern] type that is purely derived from
    mathematical ratios. One example you should look at is Bodoni (Didot and to a
    certain extent, Bulmer, closely follows). Albeit Bodoni isnt the greatest for
    textface in my experience. The hairline serif simply diminish when under 8 pt.
    It seemed like you wanted a serif-face but I would recommend some Humanistic sans
    that is also very geometrical such as Frutiger. Good Luck.

    the fonts that you\u2019ve proposed. Some of them are extremely interesting. Enigma

    such a novice in what regards typography, but I do admire you for all this amazing
    work that you\u2019re doing. The one that I like the most is Delicato from MAC
    RHINO. It is indeed what I had in mind. Now I just have to convince my boss about
    it.\r\nThanks again,\r\nIoana"

  body: "Dear Ioana,\r\nwhilst there are many excellent suggestions in the above thread,
    it would seem to me that a slightly different approach might be applied to this
    problem.\r\n\r\nAs you know, D'Arcy Thompson's book, On growth and form, looks
    at the relationships between form and proportion. There are well known parallels
    between certain of Thompson's drawings, and the plates which Durer published concerning
    the proportions of the human face. In each case, a grid is placed upon the (biological)
    form, the lines of the grid are displaced, and the resulting transformation applied
    to the underlying biological struture.\r\n\r\nThe closest approximation to this
    kind of transformational approach is expressed typographically in a rather beautiful
    book called \"L'art et la science de la vraye proportion des lettres attiques\"
    written by Geoffroy Tory (1480 - 1533) and which you may consult in pdf format
    at the French National Library at:\r\n\r\nhttp://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-52553\r\n\r\nYou
    will see that there are strong typographic similarities here to the work of both
    Durer and Thompson.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to infuse your typography with these ideas,
    I would suggest searching for a typeface whose design is itself inspired by the
    relations and proportions of the human face and body. This would mean searching
    for a truly Renaissance letter, ie: one designed between 1480 and perhaps 1580.
    One revival which comes to mind is the face \"Tribute\" by Frank Heine, based
    on his studies of a type specimin of Fran\xE7ois Guyot's, printed in the Netherlands,
    around 1565. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=196\r\n\r\nOther faces of
    this period might also comme to mind, like those of Claude Garamond, or of Nicolas
    Jenson, but Heine always felt that certains of these recent versions are highly
    interpreted. His design remains in certain respects rather more archaic, and perhaps
    closer to a sense of this period.\r\n\r\nIf you use a truly Renaissance face,
    I think you will incarne a deep sense of proportion in your book, close to the
    spirit of both Durer, Tory and Thompson.\r\n\r\nI will be very interested to learn
    of your final choice,\r\n\r\nbest wishes,\r\n\r\npete\r\n\r\n "
