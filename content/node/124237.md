  body: "It seems too well shaped to be a bitmap font, although it's possible. It
    resembles [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/officina-serif/?refby=bowfin|ITC
    Officina Serif]], but that has been the closest font I have found.\r\nThe 'g'
    is one difficult feature to match, because most slab serifs have a right-pointing
    serif on the stem of the 'g'; this one has a vertical-looking stem, with no serif.\r\n\r\n-

  body: As it looks like to come from a website, one possible way to positively identify
    it would probably be to inspect CSS code.
