body: "Kia ora folks. I scanned a speciman of what I believe is Polyphilus. I got
  it from \"the Typographic Book\" by Stanley Morrison if I remeber correctly. It
  struck me as having a very nice feel to it, a combination of irregularity and odd
  character shapes. I know this is a third generation image, but that doesn't worry
  me. The image I saw in the book was really beautiful. To help understand why it
  felt so nice as a typeface, I did a quick digitisation by eye (called polyfiller
  in the pdf) and some print-outs to get the feel. I then drafted a new version (called
  elegantia, after a pretty word in the speciman copy) based on my observations. \r\n\r\nIn
  elegantia there is a heavy baseline emphasis. The upper serifs have been blunted
  / triangulated.  I also noticed a subtle right-hand lilt to the original, and have
  incorporated this subtlety into the serif and stroke treatment. It is only an unhinted
  draft at this stage. What does it do to your eyeballs? \r\n\r\nKris.\r\n"

  body: "Kris, your original specimen is Monotype Poliphilus, not the original Griffo's
    font used in Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, 1499. Monotype Poliphilus is an experimental
    replica cut in 1923 under direction of F.H. Pierpont, later digitized and currently
    sold as Poliphilus MT.\r\nI think your idea of reinterpreting ink squash (two
    layers of it!) as intentional features might bring some interesting results. The
    first verion of Elegantia is encouraging, but I see a conflict between chiseled
    features of u, z, and unexpectedly slick e and g. Also, your o has an unusual
    axis not supported by other letters."

  body: "As Sergei says, this has been digitized by Monotype, who I'm sure have the
    rights. It was also something of a failed experiment of getting the look of 16th
    century ink spread into a 20th Century type. The simulated antique look I think
    has limited appeal. \r\n\r\nThe smooth redrawing of Poliphilus as Bembo was wonderful
    and deservedly successful in metal. The digitization of Bembo was not successful,
    and Bembo Book has recently been drawn to try to achieve that. But my impression
    is that it hasn't captured the magic of the metal. Aetna is a version of the original
    Griffo type that some people have spoken highly of. \r\n\r\nI think that as it
    stands your digital version, like the Monotype original and digital versions,
    is uneasily positioned between being a faithful reproduction of an antique--like
    Founders Caslon--and a modern redrawing, such as Adobe Garamond. "

  body: "I was sure that the image is from a reproduction of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphil,
    but stand corrected! I am aware of the roots of Polyphilus and Bembo (doesn't
    Bembo look absolutely fabulous in Edward Tufute's books!). I haven't seen Jack's
    version of Aetna in print, but heard a lot about it. It is a little uneasy, I
    agree. It is almost an informal experimant more than anything. I have no real
    interest in creating a faithful reproduction, I find most simulations a tad contrived.
    It is the feel and quirkiness that I want! Ahh, contradictions.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your feedback chaps, it is appreciated. "
