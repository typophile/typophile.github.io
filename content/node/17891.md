    written out in text; using a symbol for it makes about as much typographical sense
    as using the alchemical symbols for Venus and Mars to indicate men and women in
    text. So, why craft it as a lower-case character? Typographers can't presume to
    make good style choices for authors, but maybe they can help discourage poor ones.\r\n\r\nThe
    symbol <infinity> seems to me best thought of as a transcendental value--like
    the constants <em>c</em> for the speed of light, or <em>g</em> for the force of
    gravity--and not a mathematical operator. But that's where things get tricky,
    no? Because <em>c</em> and <em>g</em> usually show up--I think--as italic characters
    in the base font of the text. So you're back to where you--that is, I--started."

  body: "Interesting question, and it's good too see you're putting thought into mathematical
    symbols.\r\n\r\nMathematically speaking, infinity is neither an operator nor a
    transcendental number (they  are a subset of those real numbers that aren't rational).
    \ It's not a number at all, but it's usually used analogously to a literal number,
    and as such it should preferrably harmonize with the figures in your font.  It's
    interesting to compare it to the zero, which often occurs in the same contexts
    as an infinity sign, also used to be hard to grasp for people, historically, and
    incidentially shows the same uncertainty between a stressed and monoline glyph
    in old typefaces.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, mathematical typesetting prefers
    the stressed version, as far as I can tell.  As infinity takes a sign, it should
    be centred with respect to the horizontal bar of the plus and minus signs; it
    should have equal sized loops and look neither like a bow tie nor (worse!) like
    two circles with fused curves. If you keep Ourboros in mind you can't go wrong.\r\n\r\nFavourites
    are difficult, there's not much choice in mathematical fonts.  The following example
    from a custom math font to go with Times illustrates proper design and alignment:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/infty.png]\r\n\r\nAre
    you designing a complete font for mathematics, or are you just trying to fill
    a required encoding point? In the latter case it's likely never going to be used
    anyway, I'm afraid. You might as well save some effort and fake an infinity sign
    by rotating your eight, as they did in the bad old days... You still see lots
    of infinity signs with larger right loops, doublessly originating from this practice.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, there's no hard rule that operators (and relations) shouldn't be drawn
    stressed.  That works better for such symbols as are derived from simple geometrical
    shapes, but for example \"proportional to\" and \"approximately equal to\" signs
    are regularly drawn with stress and arguably look less clumsy this way. Mathematicians
    also have no qualms about using text symbols (asterisks, ampersands) as operators
    in specialized context.\r\n\r\n\r\nTim"

    later produce an accompanying math font, so it makes sense to tackle some of these
    problems now, rather than have an eventual discrepancy between the same character
    in regular and math versions of the face.\r\n\r\nYour point about infinity harmonizing
    with figures: that's possible with old-style figures, but I feel that the landscape

    usefulness.\r\n\r\nYou should definitely look at old style numbers for reference.
    The infinity sign will appear in similar places as a number, but it will never
    be directly next to a digit, so it doesn't have to harmonize with lining figures
    in that sense.  The main point is that it's not analogous to a lowercase letter,

        pre-war) books and papers, but it's become increasingly unusual since.  I
        wasn't aware of a cultural difference in this regard (although there are substantial
        differences between the anglo-american style of maths typesetting and the
        continental European one; just as the metric system, the latter forms the
        basis for the international standard but is mostly ignored in the US). However,
        a quick and totally unsystematic look through old papers that are available
        online shows that the American Physical Society switched to lining numbers
        as early as 1924, while British Journals still used old style numbers in the
        fifties.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer to use old style numbers unless publication
        style requires something else. I'm currently setting my DPhil thesis in this
        style, and none of the proofreaders (Physicists) seemed to notice the  numbers
        at all. They are easier to tell apart even when used at small sizes, and since
        most mathematical formulae use mixed case, they seem more natural. Moreover,
        operators are usually aligned to lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nUsing lining numbers
        also has the added disadvantage that you have to worry about what to do with
        the remaining numbers in your document, and there's not really a good answer
        to that; typically lining numbers are used throughout.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

    a consideration for the possibility that the symbol could be used at both large

    that the newer the font is, the more likely it is that the symbol is the work
