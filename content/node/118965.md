  font reminds me the Zipper, there are some details that don't match. Anyone got
  some idea?\r\n\r\nThanks, O\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Valencia_5533.jpg]"

    body: "Thanks Monica, Stretto is very near true, like the Zipper. \r\nI first
      thought it was a bad made vinyl cut of one of these but the R, who is clearly
      different, seems designed. \r\n"

  body: "There were many typefaces designed in this style in late Sixties/early Seventies,
    such as Strada (http://opera78.livejournal.com/254275.html), Beat Star (http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32135/beat-star),
    and Sintex (http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/31801/sintex).\r\nBut even the precursor
    of them all, 1889\u2019s Gothic Bold (http://www.flickr.com/photos/hithro/7753073390/in/set-72157631002519134)
    sports a curved leg on |R|.\r\nMy guess is that the sample is from a knock-off
    font specifically designed for sign-cutting machines.\r\n(or maybe done with FontStruct,
    like Cowboy Hippie: http://www.cheapprofonts.com/Cowboy_Hippie_Pro.php ;)\r\n\r\nOf
    note, the sample shows two different widths, unlike any of the above."

      for it. There's a topic about Valencia street signage that i would love to develop.\r\nWill
      take time to upload some pics here.\r\n\r\nO\r\n"
