    concept for the typeface was to give it a bit of a razorwire flavor so I did it
    all with straight lines and allowed sharp protrusions where there were intersections
    but in a controlled manner so that the glyphs would interlock a bit. I limited
    the angles to one oblique of a bout 40 degrees and 90 degrees from it or the baseline.
    I may complete the typeface and see if there is a market for a modern blackletter
    perhaps with the rock band folks or some such thing.\r\n\r\nThe border is supposed
    to look like that tire chain stuff that is seen around license plates on cars.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    I think El Pulpo has it perfect. Information overload with a gradient for good
    measure. \r\n\r\nI had no idea El Santo was a typophile?\r\n\r\n<strong>I think
    it's time for the mashup royal rumble battle poster between all the luchadors
    in the ring.</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd what happened to the luchadora Chicken Lips?
    Too much testosterone here? Most luchadoras have enough testosterone to match
    the most macho honcho. (please don't hurt me -- I'm just following the smack talk

    Battle) when the Mexican Army repelled the attack of the French Army invading
    the country in 1862 claiming the payment of debts and supporting the imposition
    of Maximiliano de Hasburgo as monarch. \r\n\r\nDespite of this the french occupied
    the country until 1867.\r\n\r\nIt's a national holiday for schools but certainly
    not the most important date for the country. It has received lots of attention
    from the north american government as a political strategy and a symbolic celebration
    (america for the americans). \r\n\r\nPun would be \"broma\" \"juego de palabras\".
    A more witty and lascive pun would be called \"albur\".\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    is very interesting the way they found a translation to football. It is a crazy
    thing as putting BALL and FOOT backwards, more and less like this:\r\n\r\nBALLFOOT\r\n\r\nAnd
    also to remember, colega, the few years I spent in Seville back in the early nineties.
    The Betis stadium, Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera is very small if compared with
    their huge rival, ER Sevilla. Nonetheless their smallness they are leons. Not
    to mention that around in the neighborhood, which is residential, there are lots
    of caf\xE9s with good food and all the folks out at night, Y LAS PALMAS. A la
