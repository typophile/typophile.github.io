  the book that is being published by my art and design school for this years graduating
  students. The students that are designing it, were thinking about using FF DIN for
  it. But they sort of asked me as 'type consultant' to give them some alternatives.\r\n\r\nI
  want to suggest a few typefaces that have a similar square and mechanical look,
  but with a more humanistic touch, so to speak.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about typefaces
  like [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=10|Flama]] and [[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/|Apex
  New]]. They have a similar feel, but are less rigid. So typefaces like Klavika are
  too square.\r\n \r\nI have a few others in mind, but I'm hoping you guys can point
  me to some typefaces I might otherwise overlook.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Thanks so far. :)\r\n\r\nI knew that Attack of the thread. But some of them
    are a bit too square. I guess maybe square isn't the right description. I meant
    it in the way DIN is square (like its characters look like they fit into a rectangle)."
