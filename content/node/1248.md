  body: FF Prater Script is something like it, but obviously different. There is something
    familiar about this font, but I cannot recall where I saw it before. That&#39;s
    the best I can suggest right now.

  body: thanks a lot for your efforts! unfortunately, FF Prater, Nordik Fish and the
    beautiful Karen&#39;s script  lose that  germanic scholar feel of , say, 10&#39;s
    or 20&#39;s. The sample comes from a pic taken in a french concetration camp for  spanish
    children in the civil war 1936-1939. <BR> <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16089.jpg"
