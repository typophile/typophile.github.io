body: "Im being tasked for a typography class to develop a 96 page + book / quarterly
  journal on the topic of the science of survival. Its aimed at information design
  and concept driven layout. I've selected an assortment of texts to use throughout
  the book. I've chosen to focus on global warming and \"surviving\" it. \r\n\r\nIm
  at a block in terms of concepts and titles. The title I have now is that of this
  post. I had also thought about \"Canary in a Coalmine.\" Im just shopping around
  for concepts and ideas and how to illustrate them typographically. This can be subtle
  hints in the body of the book and or the layout and \"feel\" of the work. I essentially
  want the book to define global warming, define the causes of and detail the solutions
  to. . . aimed at your everday some what green minded consumer. \r\n\r\nThoughts
  or directions would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"

    not dispense with military and marketing metaphors, and communicate with responsible
    citizens?\r\n\r\n"

    The thought is its not just important on how the fuel is made but how it gets
    to its source. So scientists are rating "Carbs" on how really efficient these
    fuels are. Maybe a food reference? '

  body: An excellent survival technique is to wait until the actual data is finalized
    and made public in May. Until then, keep an open mind.

  body: "Could turn into a interesting project, beyond the content you could try a
    design that reduces the amount of greenhouse gases during production, presumably
    this would involve efficient use of each page, reduced number and coverage of
    inks, paper choice, etc. Might be beyond what you can achieve in the time allowed
    for your project.\r\nOne detail that a prospective purchaser might require is
    a carbon footprint calculator to assess their impact and which areas they can
    work on.\r\nAlternatively you could wait for <em>actual data</em>!\r\n\r\nTim"
