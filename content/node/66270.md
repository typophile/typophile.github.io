  body: "It appears that there is no omacron; but you can easily compose one: \r\nIn
    the glyph palette, you'll see there is a \"combining macron\" (see below); if
    you type a normal \"o\" and then insert this combining macron from the glyph palette,
    it will sit/slide on top of the \"o\"; you might just have to kern it a little
    to adjust its placement.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/macron_6124.gif]"
