<div class=commentbody>That sort of happened to me wearing a kafiyyeh in Arizona once (in the early 90s). "What does that mean?" the waitress spurted as we were leaving, visibly contorting between the two pressures of "the customer is always right" and [manipulated] patriotism. These days I think I'd just get shot before even making it to the entrance. By the guy who cleans the toilets. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Sounds like <br>>something that better typography could address. <br> <br>No. <br>It is something that better education must address. <br>A society where all -philes and ped-s are subject to public rage (in Britain, some doctors who had a sign saying "pediatrician" were almost lynched) has a serious problem. Ignorance can only be cured by carefully administered doses of knowledge. <br>Unfortunately, right-wing politicians don't seem to be in favour of education, thinking that the more stupid people are, the more likely they are to vote for them. Which says a lot about their self-esteem. <br>Jan</div>

<div class=commentbody>We're wandering off-topic here (what would Matthew -- and Walgreens -- think about all this?) but: <br> <br>Hrant, are you saying that you have to be stupid to vote at all in America? That's pretty extreme. I mean, it's the kind of assumption that also underlies fascism. But I guess that's not what you mean. What's the alternative? Better typography? Enlightened dictatorship? Marilyn Manson for president? I'm suddenly sorry that we did not get to talk politics when we met recently. <br>Jan</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jan, I'd really much rather talk type anyway. Talking about good governmental structures is even more pointless than talking about true smallcaps or the benefits of hybrid numerals. So to spare people the aggravation (and myself the keystrokes) let me just point you to the one time I wasn't totally incoherent about the topic: <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/28515.html target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/28515.html</a> - Thursday, March 18, 2004, 3:19 pm <br> <br>As for being "extreme", I guess it's a matter of viewpoint. To me the world is currently in an "extreme" state, there's no sign of possible improvement on the horizon, and gradual correction has become preposterously idealistic. Sometimes you have to destroy to rebuild properly. <br> <br>> what would Matthew -- and Walgreens -- think about all this? <br> <br>Most probably diametrically opposite things. Carter's "I am a communist" during his kaffeeklatsch at TypeCon98 is memorable - it could have been an auto-simplification (something I do a lot), but still. <br> <br>Yves, a kaffiyyeh is apparently something you wear to signal that you want to kill innocent Americans. I don't want to kill Americans (even guilty ones), but I do own one: it's a black-and-white (the red-and-whites come from the badaween, I believe, and I consider classier), it's made in Syria, but it's one-sided, so not really the real thing. Not that I can wear it any more anyway. <br> <br>BTW, Karen Huang occasionally does good food on her blog. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
