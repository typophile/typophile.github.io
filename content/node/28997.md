body: I drove to Pennsylvania over the weekend and, as I had hoped, saw some road
  signage in <a href="http://clearviewhwy.com/">Clearview</a>. It's as good as advertised
  - much better than Highway Gothic. Some of the warning signs were done up in too
  light a face, but that was the signmaker's fault, not Terminal Design's. Anyone
  else see it regularly?

    No question its more legible than Highway Gothic. My girlfriend and I would play
    the spot Clearview game on roadtrips. (We're both graphic designers aka <em>nerds</em>.)

  body: I believe it's not just more legible. It also has just that little bit of
    style allowable in a font of this type. It's actually attractive. It would be
    interesting to see if James would admit to this characterstic. Maybe it's just
    so well thought out and competently done that it can't help being attractive.

  body: "Well Brad, I'm gald you think it is attractive. When Clearview was discussed
    on Typographica a while back a lot of folks thought it not.\r\n\r\nAS to the too
    light warning signs, Black letters on light backgrounds (Negative Contrast) are
    a problem. We have designed a series of ClearviewHwy fonts specifically for Negative
    Contrast applications (they have a B in the name). All the fonts a a bit bolder
    and have tighter letterfit. As of this date the FHWA has not approved the negative
    contrast designs for use, but  alot of copies are being licensed, so I think they
    may be making it onto the roadscape without the Fed approval.\r\n\r\nOn another
    note our ClearviewOne fonts (the general purpose version of the Highway fonts)
    are being updated to OpenType and should be on our website when our new site goes
    up in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nCyrillic versions are underway and we hope to add Greek
    this year as well.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n"

  body: One of the things I like about Clearview is it basic form similarities to
    the father of most modern humanist sans faces - Johnston's Underground type. I
    know Clearview is nothing like a copy of Johnston, that Clearview is much more
    sophisticated, and that there are many important differences. But the fact that
    James arrived at his face after exhaustive research and it still resembles Johnston
    at so many points says something about the genius of Johnston's work, and James's
    too.

    Rawlinson when they decided against it and any other sans solution.\r\n\r\nThe
    Cyrillic and eventually Greek are being created to potentially grow Clearview's
    use as a roadway signage solution. Who know how it will turn out.\r\n\r\nI don't
    really see the Johnson Underground influence. British Transport was more of an
    influence."

  body: "I don't see many similarities to Transport and Johnston stylistically. Jonhston
    is far more humanist in its construction than Transport. Transport is a little
    more draftsman and Akzidenz influenced than Johnston. \r\n\r\nI think a better
    comparison would be to Jock Kinneir's other design Rail Alphabet, which was one
    of the first sans serif signage faces (if not the first) to create both a negative
    and positive version of the design at different sizes to account for the optical
    trick of reversed out type looking larger."

    Those you identify as such are Federal Highway Standard Alphabet Series Emod,
    E, D, C or B, sometimes referred to as Highway Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe design you refer
    to as Interstate is a commercial font derived from this design. It has never been

  body: "Back when I first realized that all the smaller street signs in Glendale
    (and maybe further afield, and I do mean field :-) were handmade, an improbable
    mental image popped into my head, and I've never been able to get rid of it: a
    man gets a phone call at home from the city, turns to his wife and yells \"hun,
    thems be needin' a sign fer 'Wabasso' by noon-like Thursdee\", and the somewhat
    portly and very white woman in the other room whips out here scissors, pulls out
    the special black sticky paper stuff, and starts a'cuttin'. She used to REE-ly
    on this fancy maynooal with the pitchurz of how them city folk would rather have
    the letters on their signs be lookin' like if they had their druthers, but these
    days she just cuts 'em from her good ol' Germanic memory. Meanwhile, the husband
    goes to the shed in the back, pushes the goats aside, and PROH-seeds to cut some
    o' that white plastic or metal or whatever backing. He counts: W-a-b-a-s-s-o,
    makes 7, so 7 times 3, is 21, plus two inches on each side, makes 25, and WHAM,
    cuts the COH-rectly sized piece right up, and takes it back in to his old lady,
    god bless her steady hand.\r\n\r\nBTW, that sign is nothing: you should see how
    distinctly egg-shaped all the \"O/o\"s are around here - it makes you think there
    was indeed one person doing all of them, and maybe she ran a chicken coop on the
    side.\r\n\r\nI don't know how old they are. But when it comes to \"missing\"\r\nshapes,
    like the tilde, anything can still happen to this day:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ca\xF1ada_1_4451.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ca\xF1ada_2_6359.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
