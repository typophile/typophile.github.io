body: "hi there,\r\n\r\ni'm looking for typefaces that would feel nice on old cassettes,
  like in this picture:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.effektivedesign.co.uk/files/gimgs/1_latest-cassette-badges2.jpg\r\n\r\nactually
  i'm looking specially for the one used in the grey cassette, \"C-60\", in red [with
  white stripe].\r\n\r\nany further font indication would be appreciated. the strokes[the
  band]-like fonts, fonts used in old soccer uniforms (like the square numbers used
  by the netherlands in the last WC), avant garde alternates style fonts, helvetica-like
  and so on.\r\n\r\nthank you in advance."
