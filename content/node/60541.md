body: "I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the role of color (not typographic color\u2014color
  color) as a typographic variable akin to size, leading, measure, etc.\r\n\r\nOn
  many screens, light is projected in various combinations of red, green, and blue
  to produce every piece of text \u2014 even black and white text. For screens made
  with RGB sub-pixels (sometimes BGR), red type on a black background is one third
  the thickness of white type on the same black background (for red type, only the
  R sub-pixel is lit; for white type, R, G, and B are all lit). So on screen, color
  can directly affect the shape of letters and whole typeset texts.\r\n\r\nHas there
  ever been a print equivalent to this kind of constraint? If so, were there any interesting
  experents or techniques associated with it? Or, rather, is this a non-issue? On
  screen, on a black background, even though red type is thinner than white type,
  does it *look* thinner? Are individual sub-pixels even noticeable?"

    guess not. Usually 'text typeface' designers care mostly about the positive-negative
    appearance of their glyph shapes in variable sizes. They usually create a slightly
    altered/thinned versions of the regular weight if they intend to make their typefaces
    still look legible when printed on a small size, this has something to do with
    the ink blot on the printed surface. Ones who care about the on-screen appearance
    are usually type designers that designed 'pixel typefaces.'\r\n\r\nA process called
    'hinting' is usually done when a type designer wanted their 'text typeface' look
    good when viewed on a small 'screen' size. But then again, usually hinting deals
    with the positive-negative appearance of the glyph shapes, in plain black and
    white color. Matthew Carter's Verdana and Georgia is one example of fine-hinted
    typeface.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n\"On screen, on a black background, even though red
    type is thinner than white type, does it *look* thinner?\"\r\n\r\nI guess so,
    it's a basic principle in typography. The only typeface I knew that take attention
    about this 'screen' color is Underware's Unibody. But then again, I'm not an expert,
    so I definitely might be wrong. I'm aware of the font-aliasing technologies on
    nowadays browsers or operating systems, but I don't really have a deep understanding
    of them. :D\r\n\r\nPS: Please excuse my english."

  body: In four-color process printing, text in unusual colors would become fuzzy
    according to the dpi of the screen (not monitor screen, screen screen). A pure
    red (100%M, 100%Y) would usually be as sharp as black, but something like a bright
    green, a brown, a lilac, or even just 50% grey would lose a lot of quality, especially
    if there is more than one color in it and the registration isn't perfect.

  body: "I'd say that problems in print outnumber those caused by RGB pixels. Related
    to registration that Kevin mentions, there are problems associated with trapping,
    then different problems related to screening, and different again problems related
    to the printing method itself, such as inking and pressure in letterpress or water\u2013ink
    balance in offset."
