body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nCould someone please assist in identifying the following font
  that can be found on the Sofitel Melbourne website. It's used on the navigational
  bars, is sans serif, and I have only seen it in uppercase. I tried the Identifont
  website (and a few other similar sites), but wasn't able to narrow it down to something
  close.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sofitelmelbourne.com.au/cpa/htm/htm_article_hero_thumb.asp?page_id=2\">Sofitel
  Melbourne</a>\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStuart."
