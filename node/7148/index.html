  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m redesigning a printed ballot for the Vancouver municipal elections as part of my communication design senior project at ECIAD. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for something with some or all of the following characteristics: <BR> <BR>- high short-burst legibility <BR>- family of weights, widths if possible <BR>- letter-forms with visible differences from character to character to help with dyslexic/ESL reading <BR>  &#40;opposite of prokyon, univers, helvetica?&#41; <BR>- confidence with a little character and warmth <BR>- contemporary feeling <BR>- good optical characteristics at various sizes <BR>- efficient character count &#40;high x-height &amp; condensed available?&#41; <BR>- perhaps suitable for voting instructions, signage, etc <BR> <BR>A lot to ask, I know. The final choice will obviously be a compromise on one area vs. another. All suggestions of any kind are greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks very much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find anything that is specifically well optimized for dyslexic/non-Latin readers, which also comes in a large family of weights and widths. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll also note that legibility and efficient character count &#40;including condensed widths&#41; are largely opposed to each other. Newspaper text faces try to walk that line, but they are also optimized for small sizes and don&#39;t meet the rest of your needs. <BR> <BR>Overall, I&#39;m thinking something in the same general design space as Myriad or Frutiger would seem best suited to the job. Humanist sans, pretty legible, available in a wide range of weights and widths. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rrrrrr. <BR> <BR>Resist the impulse to default to sans. I still say Trinité. It has the condensed and extended widths you require, it has the  multiple available extender lengths you require, it&#39;s superbly legible, it certainly fills your need for &#34;confidence with a little character and warmth,&#34; need I go on? <BR> <BR>Other TEFF fonts are designed in similarly versatile ways &#40;see also Lexicon.&#41; The closest Adobe font I can think of is Kepler. Many would dismiss it because of its modern serif tendencies, but I think it&#39;s a fine and versatile design, perfectly legible, and certainly not overexposed. <BR> <BR>Step away from the sans!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wait a minute, I love serifed text as much as your next humanist, but I don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with &#34;defaulting to a sans&#34; here. Especially when one is dealing with short tracts of texts, sans serifs can be highly useful.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not saying that a sans <b>must</b> be used here, but I think that it would be silly to rule them out per some sort of dogma. <BR> <BR>Here are just some suggestions of humanist sans serifs, with condensed as well as regular weights: <BR> <BR>Font Bureau&#39;s Benton Sans <BR><a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10978590829497945&amp;fontname=BentonSans" target="_blank">http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10978590829497945&amp;fontname=BentonSans</a> <BR> <BR>H&amp;FJ&#39;s Gotham <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html</a> <BR> <BR>Storm&#39;s John Sans <BR><a href="http://www.stormtype.com/jsans.html" target="_blank">http://www.stormtype.com/jsans.html</a> <BR> <BR>Linotype Vialog &#40;this is a slightly narrow face, it has no regular or condensed, but a ton of weights.

		<div class="commentbody">Generally I don&#39;t like sans fonts, but for careful, deliberate reading at small sizes they&#39;re better than serif fonts. The problem is <i>most</i> sans fonts are more modular &#40;hence more ambiguous&#41; than the typical serif face. I think the ideal here would be a sans that&#39;s &#34;quirky&#34; - in the right ways though. One font I might recommend is Burke&#39;s Pragma&#42;. And if you go with sans, maybe his FF Parable. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html" target="_blank">http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html</a> <BR> <BR>Also, stay away from highly chirographic&#42; fonts: although they&#39;re not as bad as geometrically constructed designs, they&#39;re still too formally modular - it&#39;s just a less obvious modularity. Look at the b/d/p/q in your average chirographic font: the bowls are too similar. Good for aesthetic harmony, bad for reading. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which is a term meaning a design that exhibits the vestiges of handwriting/calligraphy. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This may sound obvious, but i do know my faces pretty well: <BR> <BR>that description sounds like the brief for FF Meta, when i first designed it for the German post office as PT 55 back in 1985. It now even has a condensed version, and it was designed for very small sizes on bad paper with low-res typesetting. It&#39;s human, it&#39;s warm, it&#39;s a Sans. OK, it&#39;s overused, but aren&#39;t the Frutigers and Myriads even more so?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here’s my progress so far: <BR> <BR>Round One: <BR>ClearviewOne, Compatil, Corpid, Documenta, Frutiger/FrutigerNext, Info, Kievit, Meta, Myriad, Parisine, PMN Caecilia, Syntax, Transit, Thesis <BR> <BR>Round Two: <BR>ClearviewOne, Corpid?, Meta, Myriad, Thesis <BR> <BR>I’ll have to spend some time with these behemoths to decide further. <BR> <BR>Going into this I initially thought of Myriad and Meta as the most obvious choices. Mr. Spiekermann you were right on target with the suggestion of Meta. Thank you for posting. <BR> <BR>As far as sans serif vs. serif, I think a mild slab-serif might have use - eg. de Groot’s TheMix.
