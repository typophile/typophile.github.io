  \"A Diamond is Forever\" print ads. (For reference, see here: http://www.instablogsimages.com/images/2007/08/06/debeers-1_25.jpg).\r\n\r\nI
  know it's very \"generic,\" but it has many subtleties. Be specific.\r\n\r\nThe
  Tiffany and Co font would work as a backup.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

  body: I wouldn't consider it generic at all. It's the lovely <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/perpetua_titling_light/?sample_text=NEGOTIATE&sample_size=60">Perpetua
    Titling</a>.

  body: "FWIW: Tiffany and Co. uses Sterling by H&FJ. But it was commissioned by T&Co.
    for their use only. Aside from print ads, there are examples of it on the AIGA
    website in the Design Archives.\r\n\r\nDavid"
