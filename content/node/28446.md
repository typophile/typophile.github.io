body: "Hi Guys:\r\n\r\nThis should be an easy one... I'm looking for a font that looks
  like VAG Rounded Bold or Black, but with a retro style touch (more like a disco
  fever), the one characteristic that I can clearly remember is that the \"n\" character
  has a \"curly\" end, I think that MTV might have used this font a short time ago,
  I've watched this font applied on a window display of a local shoe store with the
  phrase \"oto\xF1o-invierno\" (fall-winter)...\r\n\r\nI hope this description rings
  one or two bells...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 says: It's all about the fonts!"

    this font would have a little more class... :-(\r\n\r\nWell, I guess there's always
    something FREE for everyone around the Web...\r\n\r\nThanks for the ID Renko!\r\n\r\nQ\u2122

  body: "Ha Ha Ha!!\r\n\r\nNo disrespect meant at all... It's just that I didn't see
    it coming, I was expecting to be a more \"hard to find\" type of font, I respect
    all the Typographer's good work, I guess Ben did a great job by making such a
    popular font, don't you agree?\r\n\r\nI Just hope to make a good creative work
    using this font...\r\n\r\nThanks! Telepathic Typophiles... ;-)\r\n\r\nQ\u2122
