  trying to figure out what this particular typeface is. \r\nIt appears on the opening
  sequence of Gregory Peck's 1962 film \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"  The typography
  struck me as beautifully modern but I am yet to determine what it is set in. I think
  there's another forum on this topic that suggested Akzidenz Grotesk as being a likely
  candidate, however, they didn't arrive at any solid conclusions and I'm adamant
  that someone out there knows! Such is my curiosity that I've created an outlined
  vector file showing the differences that are most apparent to me.\r\n\r\nAnyways,\r\nThanks
  for your help!"

  body: "When i have a look at this it appears to be a phototype version of the Akzidenz
    Grotesk. This means, that i don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to reproduce it
    with a vector font. Probably it was done with a \u201Cduck-shooter\u201D or  Diatype
    (1960) from Berthold. That would explain why the letters don\u2019t look like
    todays Akzidenz.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely to be a \u201CShelter Grotesk NF\u201D
    because it is not that geometric and the /C doesn\u2019t close that much. With
    \u201CHass Grotesk\u201D i believe you refer to the \u201CAlte Haas Grotesk\u201D,
    if so, that is highly unlikely because the \u201CAlte Haas Grotesk\u201D later
    redesigned and known as Helvetica always ends its strokes with horizontal endings.
    The \u201CRoyal Grotesk\u201D would be entirely possible but it is just an alternated
    Akzidenz released in 2009, probably made by an older copy of the Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\n\r\nhope
    that helped you solving your problem\r\n\r\nbest regards"

    typefaces differ from the Diatype version.\r\nAccording to Wikipedia, the film
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_(film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]
    is from 1962 and it has been produced in the US. The first Diatype was sold in
    1960 but I wonder if Berthold had been selling these in the US as early as 1962.
    The first Starsettograph, as produced by Film-Klischee GmbH before they were bought
    by Berthold is from 1961.\r\nMy conclusion: Akzidenz Grotesk: yes, Diatype: no,
    Starsettograph: unlikely \u2026"

    body: "Exactly my point. Those versions all differ from each other.\r\nI was just
      searching for phototype machines and the first one of Berthold the Diatype happened
      to be somewhere around the release of the movie in 1962. That was more of an
      assumption than a conclusion i uttered there.\r\nIsn\u2019t there some kind
      of website, that shows the evolution process most of the popular typefaces went
      through?\r\nSomething like a history book of type =)\r\n\r\nbest regards"

    \u2018influenced by\u2019 and \u2018inflluence on\u2019 usually give a clue on
    where to look. Also www.linotype.com describes the source materials or mentions
    older typefaces that had on influence on the typefaces that are currently available."
