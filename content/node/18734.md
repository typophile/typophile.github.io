body: "I'm trying to figure out what EW's new face is that they're using on covers
  and in the feature well. Someone in another thread said it was <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=titling+gothic&image.x=0&image.y=0\">Titling
  Gothic</a>, which is close, but there are some definite differences, \"g\" and \"Q\"
  being the most obvious. There's some similarity to Helvetica Neue as well, but it's
  not a perfect match either. I'm wondering if they had a custom face done.  Thanks
  for any help.\r\n"
