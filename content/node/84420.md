  The final thing needs to include a symbol and tagline. I'd appreciate any comments
  on placement, how the elements lock up etc. Cheers. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype_kerncheck_edit4_5667.jpg]"

  body: Is there supposed to be an Ichthus in the mark?  Makes me think of some connection
    to Christianity.  I am not really feeling the subtitle font, but I don't really
    have any suggestions.  Feels like the wrong era or something.  The icon could
    be a bit larger to balance things a bit more maybe?

    connotations. Hadn''t thought too much about the Ichthus thing. Maybe ''fine jewellery''
    is too big, as well as the symbol being too small. '

    as well as the symbol being too small\r\n\r\nYes, I'd try the symbol a little
    bigger. Right now it feels like the name and symbol are too similar in visual
    weight; I think it would be better if one of them was more dominant."

  body: FWIW, don't take it the wrong way, etc -- I think the logo is all over the
    place. The symbol is precise and geometric, 2nd like is quirky with a lot of character
    (i.e. the exact opposite of the mark) and 3rd line is more of a refined understatement
    and fairly far detached from the first two. It looks like a mix of 3 styles that
    don't mix that well together.

  body: "No worries apankrat, I tend to agree. Initially the idea was to use a fairly
    neutral sans serif with the symbol, but the client really liked the wordmark and
    it is well suited to her work/influences. I guess I'm looking for ways to bring
    the three elements together more. Will look at an alternative for 'fine jewellery'\r\n\r\nThanks. "

  body: First edit - reduced the size of the symbol to let the wordmark dominate more
    + changed the tagline. Reversed on dark cards/tags/boxes is how the logo will
    mostly be used. Any thoughts appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype_kerncheck_edit5_5378.jpg]

    But I can't help getting a really strong keltic/new-agey vibe from the mark -
    intended?

    \ There are some very thin lines throughout and a couple of very awkward tiny
    dots in the middle of the fish tail that don't work even at this size.  How about
    engraved on a ring?  Maybe even beef up the subtitle a bit?\r\n\r\nI would make
    the mark as wide as you have the subtitle here, yea, huge.\r\n\r\nOr what about

    the text would work as an option.\r\n\r\nSans for the Fine Jewellery is certainly
    a step forward IMO."

  body: The stroke on the icon still feels very unresolved.  The overly heavy fill
    on the tails, the rounded path around the top of the left tail and the bottom
    of the right tail, the visual tension happening in the center area where it feels
    a bit tightly crowded.  I would rework the execution of the mark both to refine
    the form, and to compliment the wordmark better.  But without time or money, you
    kind of have your hands tied in the 'quick, cheap, good - pick 2' adage.

    makes it look like a trivial decorative knot/vignette and the eye just glances
    over it. Double stroke was what made it a <em>symbol</em>.\r\n\r\nI would give
    another try the second version from 3:43pm, but making the stroke weight on symbol
    much lighter, and reducing the symbol by 20-30%."

  body: "@apankrat - aren't you the one who suggested using it as a vignette? \r\n\r\nI
    guess it comes down to your vision of hierarchy.  Do you want the symbol or the
    name to be dominant?  What do you want people to look at first?  I agree with
    apankrat that in the last version the name is dominant, and the symbol is downplayed.
    \ But that may be exactly what you want.  To make the symbol dominant, you are
    going to have to beef it up more and make it a lot larger and refine the details.
    \ I think one reason the stroke wasn't working for me is that it looked like you
    clicked stroke and left it at that.  The double line idea could work, but it would
    need a lot of finesse in the details, and probably reworking some of problems
    with congestion in the center.  That would move it away from a stroke look to
    something more intentional and designed.  \r\n\r\nThere is something smart about
    how the name is the only part with that weight and the rest is matched thin lines.
    \ It does create a clear hierarchy.  The last version is growing on me.  Good
    job."

    balance, and the lines help tie the elements togehter, rather than having them
    sit there independently. Ultimately the name is the most important part. I''ll
    have a go at resolving some of the issues with the symbol and post back, if anybody''s
    interested. Really appreciate everybody''s thoughts. '

  body: "No rules above and below the logo. Getting too \"design trickery\"\r\n\r\nThe
    strongest part of this logo is the distinctive deco lettering for the name. As
    others have noted, the rest of the elements do not reflect this same design era.
    I think you can get away with it in the tagline (tho consider adjusting the E
    crossbars and the size of the R bowl, join of the N etc for a more arts and crafts
    feel).\r\n\r\nOn the symbol, consider a redraw finding your inspiration from arts
    and crafts sources. Eg Batch Elder tiles, Mackintosh, Green and Green etc. I can
    see it going more Japanese in influence or possible more organic William Morris.
    The direction should reflect the jewelry. It could even be that the fish/mark
    are a supporting brand theme vs part of the logo. Eg...  A fish print varnished
    on the package. A koi papercut etc\r\n\r\nAlso not sure about the E and inverted
    E together. I'd just go with one.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose from above I go with
    the \"Better Balance?\" one.\r\n\r\nNice job!"
