    as a display face. I admit my stomach turns when I see it, having had it inflicted

    Souvenir has more discipline than Goudy, coming originally from Benton. But Benguiat,
    the self-named font, and Goudy are trying for similar things, and I think Goudy
    is definitely the greater face. It has grace where Benguiat is awkward by comparison.

  body: 'I admire FW Goudy for a good many of his types, mannered or not. Many designers
    will flat out declare &#34;I like Goudy&#34; or &#34;I hate Goudy&#34;, referring
    to Goudy Oldstyle, and not knowing that the man did so many more types than the
    one he is best known for. <BR> <BR>The squashed &#34;g&#34; in Goudy Oldstyle
    was thanks to ATF, whose drawing department head, in hand with the marketing people,
    ignoring Goudy&#39;s vehement protests, deemed that the type would sell better
    with short descenders. Goudy&#39;s original drawings exhibited a much longer descent.
    Lanston Type Co. of Finland has produced both versions, which you can see on their
    website. The effect makes it an altogether different type. <BR> <BR>Type and their
    designers are too subjective a thing to bother getting defensive about, and certainly
    defending FWG will do him no good now. It&#39;s an accomlishment to leave this
    planet with one good typeface to a person&#39;s credit. We can thank Goudy for
    a good many: University of California Oldstyle &#40;Californian a few years later
    by Lanston and in the last 15 years a derivative by ITC called Berkeley&#41;.
    Deepdene, Kaatskill, Bertham, Goudy Modern, Forum, Kennerley Oldstyle, Garamont.
    That a few of these never reached a national market is due to the shortsightedness
    of the foundries of the day. The designs themselves are solid and wonderfully
    structured. <BR> <BR>One must also consider that the man was making type that
    would sell in 1925, and didn&#39;t have the advantage of being able to extrapolate
    on designs that hadn&#39;t happened yet. Goudy was attempting to break new ground,
    based mainly on Venetian sources. If he wandered from time to time into an ornamental
    mood, that, too, was very much in vogue. Look at Robert Weibking&#39;s Artcraft
    &#40;Ludlow, and BB&amp;S&#41;. FWG was making new and stylish designs &#40;some
    perhaps too stylish designs&#41;, but he was trying. In addition he did these
    single-handedly, designing, cutting matrices, and casting fonts for sale. With
    no other help than that of his wife, he carried on like this for decades, at the
    same time warding off criticisms of &#34;too commercial, self absorbed, vain and
    arrogant.&#34; Everyone else was busily making the soulless &#34;moderns&#34;
    that brought the look of book printing in the pre-twenties to a sorry decline.
    William Morris railed against the poor quality of book-making, as did Eric Gill.
    Bruce Rogers &#40;who adored Goudy and his work&#41; had no love for the type
    that was available to a book, designer in 1915. <BR> <BR>Young designers and students
    have the benefit of the information he left behind with his &#34;Typologia&#34;.
    Certainly no other foundry at the time was forthcoming with any of the internal
    secrets of the type-making process. <BR> <BR>Goudy was and is accused of repeating
    himself. I think many designers do that. It&#39;s in the personal quality of a
    human creature&#39;s line. You can look it up, because I can&#39;t recall who
    it was in Alan Haley&#39;s book, &#34;Hot Designers Make Cool Fonts&#34; who stated
    that every time he drew an &#34;a&#34; it looked the same as the last one. <BR>

    is fascinating about the short descenders on Goudy Old Style not being Goudy&#39;s

    <BR>I suspect that the &#39;g&#39; puts a limit on how much you can cut the descenders

    the limit in the ATF version.  <BR> <BR>All this doesn&#39;t answer Fredrik&#39;s

    <BR> <BR>But I do suspect that uniformity of taste - such as rejection of Goudy

    thank you, ATF!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Making the descenders notably shorter than the
    ascenders in a text face isn&#39;t a matter of taste or marketing, it&#39;s a
    matter if &#34;ergonomic&#34; reality, the way language actually uses the letterforms.
    The &#34;g&#34; is the benchmark because its descender needs the most vertical
    space to elaborate itself - as a result it suffers first/most. But it <i>has</i>
    to suffer aesthetically for the benefit of the x-height and ascenders, for the
    benefit of the font as a little machine, at the cost of its own painterly prettiness.
    Text fonts are a lot less about aesthetics than some people might like. <BR> <BR>This
    is difficult to explain convincingly, much less understand with a closed mind

    <BR>One thing that strikes me is how many Americans will defend a design because

    it&#39;s American. <BR> <BR>That said, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all a matter
    of &#34;fashion&#34; in most cases. It certainly isn&#39;t in mine, since I&#39;m
    fashion-ignorant. But personally I don&#39;t dislike Goudy and his work, I just
    think he&#39;s over-rated &#40;in America&#41;. If you must be partial to an American,
    make it Dwiggins: he was a genius &#40;and I never use that word lightly&#41;.

    to hear that Helvetica is now on this capricious world&#39;s list of &#34;don&#39;t
    touch with a barge pole&#34; typefaces. I had always thought that Helvetica was
    superbly drawn, and is as good now as it was when it was released; but then, I
    was there when it was. If you were designing in 1962, at its release in North
    America, your choices would have been Metro or Trade Gothic, and I like BOTH of

    You don&#39;t have to like it. It&#39;s just history. <BR> <BR>With foundries
    in the days of metal, is was common for the head of the Drawing Office to make
    artistic decisions about new faces. That person could do so with absolute authority.
    A good many prominent designers have suffered the same unpleasant surprise in
    seeing their design change before their eyes. By all accounts Goudy was firm,

    we still suffer from that? I live in Finland. The old is mainly preserved by government
    restrictions. For instance you can not paint your house any colour you want, you
    do not buy a house, you buy a yellow house or a pink house. That is what is deeded.
    So the old always looks like it always did. Some merely newer than others by the
    freshness of paint. &#34;There are very limited paint colours sold in Finland
    for exteriors of houses and buildings.&#34; For god sakes, what ever you do, don&#39;t
    buy paint from Sweden. &#34;Those would be Swedish colours&#34;. <BR> <BR>The
    first &#34;new housing&#34; in a &#34;new housing area&#34; dictates what all
    houses will forever look. Ugly is sacred.  <BR> <BR>The new is so straight it
    makes water level arch.  <BR> <BR>You could not build a beautiful house if you
    wanted to. If you build a house in a new area it will look like the walls of a
    train station bathroom, if you build in the country it will look like a barn.
    <BR> <BR>Eleil Saarinen would not be able to build the houses and buildings that
    he is so famous for were he working in Finland today. <BR> <BR>This should give
    warning to us that if distillations of unforgiving opinions of those with dictitorial
    ilk are allowed to govern typographical taste in the future all typography will
    look like &#34;Nokia on steroids&#34;. <BR> <BR>So god bless Goudy and America!
