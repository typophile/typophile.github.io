body: "I replied to something in a ten-year-old thread, and that was a mistake, if
  only because it turns out to now have an uninformative title.\r\n\r\nAnyways, in
  that old thread, the claim was made (by Gerald Giampa) that Monotype has a finer
  level of spacing than foundry type. Hrant Papazian expressed disagreement.\r\n\r\nI
  had something to add to this at this late date.\r\n\r\nFoundry type, of course,
  inherently has no mechanical limitation as to its widths. To speak, therefore, of
  its limits, we have to cite a specific instance of actual practise. Fortunately,
  there is an obvious choice.\r\n\r\nFrom information in the ATF type specimen books,
  but more importantly, from Legros' and Grant's <em>Typographic Printing-Surfaces</em>,
  I have surmised that regular ATF types, as opposed to their Self-Spacing Type and
  similar products, was designed so that all widths were a multiple of 1/4 point.
  Or, if one prefers, of 1/48 of the pica em, to use correct printing terminology.\r\n\r\nMonotype,
  as we know, uses an 18-unit system. Thus, if we're looking at 9 point type, the
  widths of the letters in a font are all multiples of 1/2 of a point. If, instead,
  we're looking at 12 point type, the widths of the letters are all multiples of 2/3
  of a point.\r\n\r\nSo it's obvious: Monotype loses.\r\n\r\nNot so fast. Because
  there is another question to be examined. Fine spacing is a good thing to have,
  but how much of it is actually usable is another matter.\r\n\r\nThe IBM Selectric
  Composer is worth looking at in this connection. It is very limited typographically.
  Not only did the regular and italic versions of a given typeface have the same spacing,
  as with Linotype, but all typefaces were spaced the same way.\r\n\r\nIt had a nine-unit
  system. However, this mechanical simplicity was partially achieved through condensing
  the M and W; comparing the widths of most characters to those in Monotype Times
  New Roman, it becomes clear that the em was divided into 11 units. And, indeed,
  11 point Press Roman on the Composer used a unit size of 1/72 of an inch, and looked
  well-proportioned. (Another of the typographic limitations of the Composer was that
  it had only three unit sizes, and so some point sizes of some faces were slightly
  condensed or stretched to fit.)\r\n\r\nWhile there are problems with documents made
  with the Composer - the Selectric mechanism couldn't align characters quite precisely
  enough for typographic purposes - the spacing was not visibly limited. On the other
  hand, proportional-spaced texts produced on a five-unit IBM Executive typewriter
  are distinguishable at sight from printing.\r\n\r\nAnd there's another thing about
  Monotype that I hadn't mentioned.\r\n\r\nA standard adjustment on the Monotype caster,
  made whenever one puts in a matrix-case for a new typeface, is to specify the set
  width. The set width is adjustable in increments of 1/4 point, and while it is usually
  close to the point size of the type, it does not have to equal it.\r\n\r\nThus,
  for a given face, 10 point type might have a set width of 10 points, 12 point type
  might have a set width of 11 3/4 points, and 6 point type might have a set width
  of 6 1/2 points.\r\n\r\nAnd so, once you have designed your typeface, you have an
  ultimate division of horizontal space into units of 1/18 of 1/4 of a point, even
  though you can't use them in a single size of a typeface.\r\n\r\nWhat they do provide
  for you, though, is the ability to make the optical adjustment of making the face
  wider in smaller point sizes by uniformly changing the proportions of every letter.\r\n\r\nWith
  ATF foundry type, on the other hand, one can't scale every character by the same
  amount when going from 11 point type to 9 point type, for example. Widths that are
  not multiples of 11/4 and 9/4 of a point, respectively, also have to be used.\r\n\r\nSo
  the fact that one has more than 18 widths in the em - but 44 of them for 11 point
  type, and 36 of them for 9 point type, rather than the same number - is not much
  of a help (see the Selectric Composer) but is a positive nuisance.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  the small discrepancies are such, though, that they can be ignored and left as tiny
  errors in the spacing between the letters. Otherwise, even if one were not making
  the smaller sizes wider, the widths of all the letters would still need to be individually
  adjusted for each point size just to fit into the mechanical limitations of the
  foundry system."

    various photocomp systems since 1980, I've had to deal with 18, 54, 250, and 1,000
    unit ems, and type sizes from 7 points to whatever in display. I would say as
    a general rule that even with the 1,000 unit em, we've not reached the point where
    use can't be made of even a fraction of an em. Now the TeX scaled point -- 1/65,536

    What the Monotype machine did (and still does) is give one the ability to make
    the <em>body</em> the character is cast on wider or narrower, not the <em>face</em>.
    That effectively changes the set, but not the proportions of the character. It
    is not true optical design, just optical spacing adjustment.\r\n\r\nAs for what
    is useful in spacing, Linotype did a study many decades ago about what amounts
    are useful and what is not. Their determination was that .0005\" is the threshold
    at which errors in weight and/or spacing become imperceptible to the human eye.
    Since we no longer use 1970 standards and have much better software and computing
    power today, a 1,000-unit EM is fine for most designs so long as very careful
    attention is paid to weights and spacing. For special situations such as very
    light fonts or connecting scripts, a 2,000-unit EM is more desirable. Anything
    higher than that really isn't needed.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'll just add a couple of things here.\r\n\r\nI didn't explicitly mention
    that the 18 units on a Monotype were each 1/18 of the set width, not the point
    size, although the system was commonly called an 18 units to the em system. That
    was probably obvious enough from my post, but I should have said it explicitly.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I find that in one case foundry types were to a 1/8 point unit in the Legros and
    Grant table I referred to.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, while Quick-Set type used
    a coarser version of the normal ATF spacing system - to 1 point if possible rather
    than 1/4 point - their earlier Self-Spacing type used a system more like Monotype's.
    However, instead of having set widths in points, the unit was an aliquot part
    of the pica em, so it was even <em>more</em> like the Selectric Composer.\r\n\r\nNow
    to address the point you made. In the United States, at least, ATF was pretty
    much the <em>only</em> company making and selling foundry type.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know what Bauer or Stephenson Blake did for spacing. However, if one doesn't do
    what ATF did - require all types to be a multiple of some unit in spacing - then
    depending on what letters are in a line of text, it might not be <em>possible</em>,
    with a finite assortment of spaces and quads on hand, to justify that line. It's
    not as if spaces had little springs in them, like Linotype wedges.\r\n\r\nSo while
    ATF may have had other technical shortcomings, I'm doubtful that in the area of
    spacing any other foundry could - or should - have done better.\r\n\r\nThat, though,
    leads into a reconsideration of my main point.\r\n\r\nThe Monotype system forces
    set widths to be an exact multiple of 1/4 point. That means the optical adjustment
    of making a typeface narrower in larger point sizes, and wider in smaller point
    sizes, is restricted to coarse discrete jumps.\r\n\r\nIn the foundry system I've
    described, while the width of each character gets rounded to the nearest 1/4 point,
    that's random noise superimposed on the ability to adjust the <em>alphabet length</em>
    in increments of 1/4 point.\r\n\r\nThe situation with foundry type then is very
    similar to what is faced today with laser printers. Imagine a laser printer with
    a dot pitch of 576 dpi - for the smaller unit of 1/8 point - then the arbitrary
    widths of characters, specified in the TrueType or Type 1 format, get rounded
    in rendering to the nearest whole number of dots.\r\n\r\nSo my original conclusion,
    that it was at least arguable that Monotype had finer spacing, based on the effective
    usable spacing presented to the type designer, may not have been correct.\r\n\r\n@Charles
    Ellertson:\r\nI take it you mean that even with 1,000-unit ems, typography had
    not reached the point where use could not be made of a fraction of a <strong>unit</strong>.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I have no reason (or facts or arguments) with which to dispute that.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I've thought that a daisywheel version of the Selectric Composer might be nice
    to have, because making the curves of characters out of dots has its limitations,
    and thus requires excessively high resolutions for high-quality printing... at
    the moment, at least, I can hardly concieve of any mechanical contrivance which
    could achieve the flexibility of spacing you are identifying as desirable. Neither
    the Selectric Composer, nor Monotype, nor foundry type, could serve as a basis.\r\n\r\nOh,
    wait. There's the Linotype wedge. <em>That</em> would work.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine
    a more compact Linotype, where you start with only one copy of each letter, and
    something like a Monotype caster casts Linotype slugs... no, you would need two
    alloys with widely separated melting points, so the first caster would run too
    hot to be practical, and the slugs would have to be cooled...\r\n\r\nBut hot metal
    is obsolete. There were very early typesetters which used a lot of the mechanical
    design from Monotype casters - and from Linotype machines too, so maybe the Linotype
    wedge could be brought into the modern era.\r\n\r\nSome CRT displays and dot matrix
    printers put dots in halfway positions, and some laser printers also have resolutions
    that are not the same horizontally and vertically - a dot might be 1/360 of an
    inch in size, and that might be the height of a scan line, but the position in
    the line can be varied by 1/1440 of an inch.\r\n\r\nDRAM is cheap, so replacing
    1/1440 of an inch by 1/144,000 of an inch is not technically infeasible."

    the shapes on the matrices in the matrix-case are what is cast. You can't stretch
    a letter to make it wider like you can with an anamorphic lens.\r\n\r\nBut I wasn't
    claiming any such thing. The discussion was about the freedom the two systems
    of spacing give to the <em>type designer</em>, not afterwards to the typesetter.
    Thus, when the type designer (or someone else working at the typefoundry in a
    hypnotic state for whom creative thought is a positive hindrance, as noted by
    Beatrice Warde) creates the original dies used to make matrices for Monotype casters,
    the pantograph in use is set to stretch or condense the letters as is appropriate.\r\n\r\nThus,
    in the case of Times New Roman from Monotype, the nominal set widths - of course
    the typesetter could adjust the caster to a larger set width for letterspacing

    11.5%, and 6 point type was widened 12.5%.\r\n\r\nNo two sizes among those I've
