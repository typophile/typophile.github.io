body: "Working on Vulpa italic. The ij glyph seems to 'want' to join. Good idea/bad
  idea?\r\nAnd on the subject of ij - do any of you put a sub i j by ij in the locl
  feature for Dutch, or is the character generally substituted automatically by Dutch
  computers (or, where their keyboards have ij key - does this key produce the correct
  unicode glyph or just i and j)?"

  body: I see what you see there, but the joined ij looks like a strangely-styled
    y with a diaeresis or umlaut over it. If you want it to be clear that this is
    /ij/ and not that other thing, I'd avoid.

  body: It seems like if you made that join, you would want to also join the ti in
    the same way. Pretty soon you are going to be doing a full connected script! (do
    it!)

  body: I figure if the standard formatting is i then j then the unconnected option
    is always available to them, but in a more display setting the user could choose
    to use the connected version if they so wished. I can't see it <cite>puzzling</cite>
    the Dutch reader any more than an st ligature puzzles an English reader. I just
    like the look of the connected version.

    puzzles an English reader.</em>\r\n\r\nThe Quaint ligatures st and ct do puzzle
    English readers, not in the sense of perplexing as to what characters they represent,
    but as to why such an affectation should have been used to frequently interrupt
    text.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026there are some super-funky \"ij\"s in the Netherlands,
    </em>\r\n\r\nBut surely they are in type and lettering (especially scripts) that
    has a general funkiness, which this style doesn\u2019t appear to.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    my opinion that for this particular typeface, an ij ligature would seem unwarranted
    and out of place to a Dutch reader.\r\nBut if the face also has some other quaints
    and oddities, maybe it would fit in.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it could be a discretionary
    ligature, but if you make it default it would be sure to annoy typographers (and
    their clients) who might like the face but don\u2019t think quaints are quite
    right for the job in hand.\r\n"

  body: Even in connecting script styles the upward stroke between /i/ and /j/ will
    look more like the /u/ form than the example shown. It is just too weird.

  body: It is too weird. Quirky, cute, but not an ij. Like Bart says, the ij is a
    running-script thing too, and is basically a /u/-shaped /y/ with two dots.

    that a user wanting those will want this one? If the answers are yes and maybe
    not, it might be better simply as a stylistic set.

    I suppose a stylistic set is the way to go.
