body: Hello typophiles; <BR>as a student in journalism, i have to do some papers about
  the US election this week. I&#39;m wondering if i can do something related with
  type. Obviously Typophile isn&#39;t endorcing any candidate but maybe you know some
  type associations &#40;or design ones&#41; doing any political stand or something
  like that ? <BR>Thanks.

    stickers?

  body: Mmm, that&#39;s a nice idea but it doesn&#39;t really fit a broad audience
    newspaper, it would be more interesting for a design magazine. <BR>I&#39;m not
    sure i could get something interesting with the time i have and the way it should
    be written.

  body: Campaign posters around here typically use a white name on a darkish-blue
    background, with a lot of stars &#40;white or red&#41;. The font tends to be a
    wide classical serif design, or sometimes a &#34;dynamic&#34; sans. <BR> <BR>hhp

    sans&#41; but i don&#39;t think i can conclude anything from that. I suppose both
    campaign logos could have been cahnged one to another without signifiance. '

  body: Chris you are so wrong, Ad agencies fight to get a piece of the hundreds of
    millions of dollars spent on campaigns. Its not a small time business getting
    someone elected any more. The reason for the looks is to appeal to the lowest
    common denominator &#40;You know I&#39;m a canadate of the people&#41; so slick
    is out. There is a huge amount of marketing &#40;and dirty tricks&#41; that goes
    into politics.

  body: One incumbant President made the Fed in charge of money, print alot of money
    to bolster the economy just before the elections to make it look like the economy
    was in better shape than it really was. It might have been the Nixon administration.
    Dirty tricks are more backroom stuff.

  body: In the 2000 election, a negative TV ad partially obstructed the word &#34;DEMOCRATS&#34;
    with another graphic element before it vanished, so as to make it read &#34;RATS&#34;
    for the briefest of moments. That might qualify as a typographical dirty trick.

  body: 'An unsuccessful Senatorial candidate here in Minnesota had a radical departure
    from the sans-on-stars n&#39; stripes approach: <a href="http://www.kenpentel.org/">Ken
    Pentel</a>. I believe his approach could be summed up in one word: Borax; i.e.,
    cleaning up Congress. <BR> <BR>And our <a href="http://archive.wellstone.org/sites/campaign2002/index.aspx">Senator
    Wellstone</a> &#40;RIP&#41; stood out from the crowd by using white on green.
    <BR> <BR>What I was trying to suggest above was not a study of how two stars n&#39;
    stripes logos differentiate from one another, but how some candidates go out of
    their way to be different.'
