    needed so web content can be easily re-tasked for printing using print style sheets.
    \  I don't believe that Hakon really cares about it for the screen - he's just
    selling the idea to publishers so implementation spreads more quickly. P-Publishers
    have this \"thing\" for pages that flip. "

    text, e.g. \"two thirds of the way through the book, left hand page, near the
    top\".\r\n\r\nBut I think that kind of \"memory\" is being supplanted by hypertext
    and search functions.\r\n\r\nFlipping simulations are flashy trash\u2014with analog
    books, I suspect that one uses a page-turn as an opportunity to blink, therefore
    not even seeing it. But perhaps the same thing occurs in the onscreen imitation.\r\n\r\nIt

    a more appropriate transitional metaphor for the web, especially with video content
    creeping into multimedia \"books\"."

  body: "I've read some books on my iPhone and iPad, and also used apps like Instapaper,
    which has a \"page\" mode similar to digital book readers. I think the page mode
    is overrated.\r\n\r\nWhen I am reading a book in the Kindle app, iBooks, Google
    Books app, etc. I often wish it would scroll like a web page. One thing I like
    about the scrolling model is that I can keep the text I'm reading in the upper
    part of the screen, especially when I am lying on my back with the device propped
    up on my chest.\r\n\r\nNick: The location/memory thing doesn't work that well
    with book readers. If you can change the font size, it completely changes the
    way the text breaks from page to page. (It does work for PDFs.)\r\n\r\nI would
    prefer some sort of scrolling model for electronic books. Perhaps there could
    be virtual page numbers along the side to help with orientation. Maybe paragraph
    numbers. I could also see sideways scrolling used to go to the next chapter. Running
    headers could be fixed at the top, again to help with orientation. "

  body: "One problem related to paging that's really huge is citing the source in
    academic papers. (christopher should be familiar with this one.)\r\nMy wife is
    in both a PHD program and a post-grad nurse practitioners program and the problem
    occurred early on: if you've bought the ebook version of a text, how do you refer
    to the page number(s)? Also, in order to keep the dollars flowing, academic publishers
    play a page number and chaptering game - they keep coming out with new editions
    that add and subtract a bit of content here and there solely to change the page
    numbers. That way, instructors and students have to keep buying the latest editions
    just to keep things straight. If you don't, you might just end up reading the
    wrong pages for next week's assignment, and that's not cool.\r\n\r\nSo, for a
    number of reasons, she gave up and stuck with the p-books. Thankfully, the web
    has also given us an easy way to resell via ebay and craigslist. And those books
    that can't be resold I just lift a few times a day to maintain muscle tone and
    build strong biceps. (The size of some of these medical books is just beyond belief.)\r\n\r\nI'm
    wondering if any of the proposed standards deal with these page numbering issues?\r\n(Kindle
    does have location numbers I believe, which do remain fixed even when font size
    repaginates, like Mark mentioned. Sold my Kindle so I can't double check. Anybody?)\r\n\r\nrich"

  body: "Now that PDF is an open standard, electronic publications can go two directions:
    push HTML/CSS in the direction of PDF, or push PDF in the direction of HTML/CSS.
    \r\n\r\nThe web standardistas have had 15 years to make the case for HTML/CSS
    as the foundation. They have not made the case. Web development is still an infuriating
    process of debugging 15 platforms simultaneously (namely, the individual web browsers).
    Apparently \"standards\" are not as standard as they look. And seemingly simple
    tasks are still impossible: try putting two page elements in a web page side-by-side,
    or in adjacent columns. Ugh. Why is this so complicated?\r\n\r\n\"Because we want
    the web to be based on open standards.\" Great, but open standards aren't much
    use if they overly limit what creators can do with them. For instance, the idea
    of semantic markup is nice, but as a publisher, it's not always what you need.
    Sometimes you need to say \"THIS THING goes THERE and THAT'S THAT.\" \r\n\r\nWorse,
    though the standardistas have always claimed the high ground \u2014\_\"our way
    is better because no one company can hijack the standards process\" \u2014 that
    process has still been repeatedly hijacked. For instance, the canvas element.
    That was something invented by Apple so its developers could avoid Flash, while
    ignoring the existing open standard for vector drawing, SVG. And then it somehow
    got shoehorned into HTML5.\r\n\r\nAs for ebooks in particular, the situation is
    even worse, because ebooks are built on a rudimentary subset of HTML/CSS. [[http://fontsinuse.com/typography-for-lawyers/|As
    I've said elsewhere]], today's ebooks are at the sophistication level of a website
    circa 1993.\r\n\r\nRespectfully to H\xE5kon Lie et al., I'm not sure that electronic
    publishing needs another round of turd-polishing, i.e. taking HTML/CSS standards
    that are woefully inadequate and making them slightly less inadequate. That sort
    of plodding incrementalism has defined the last 15 years. I shudder to think of
    plodding along the same way for another 15 years.\r\n\r\nTurning to PDF. Publishers
    who went onto the ipad with PDF versions of their publications were pilloried
    for being Luddites and idiots. But here's the thing. New York Magazine in PDF
    is a much more satisfying reading experience than the New York Times app, which
    freezes every time it shows an ad. Though at least the NYT makes an effort \u2014
    most of these news / magazine apps are a joke. Meanwhile, PDF works because a)
    it requires zero compromise and b) it's intrinsically low-tech. After all, why
    is it we want companies like the New York Times to be in the app-building business?
    To annoy us? \r\n\r\nHow about we let print companies do what they do best \u2014\_make
    print publications? I mean, the iPad and similar devices are at their best when
    they're playing content made for other media \u2014\_music, TV, movies. Why not
    just let print media be what it is, rather than forcing it to be what it isn't?
    PDF captures this reality. Martin Scorsese did not have to develop an iPad app
    so you could watch his movies on the iPad.\r\n\r\nPDF has many virtues. I, for
    one, would like to see more effort go toward making PDF a more interesting and
    capable publishing format, instead of primary attention going toward HTML/CSS.
    PDF is far from perfect, but in its current state, it's a lot closer to the ideal
    publishing platform than HTML/CSS. That's not an argument for abandoning HTML/CSS.
    It's an argument for recognizing that just as digital music and digital video
    have their own specialized file formats, digital publishing also deserves a specialized
    file format. "

    15 platforms each as an instance of fixed media.\r\n\r\nFixed Media versus Laxed
    Media.  If one simply takes the stick out of one's behind and accepts that onscreen,

    manufacturer, the user, and who knows who else, then all is well. Learning to

    you slice it. But for that, it has a firm place.\r\n\r\nRemoving the stick is
    very, very difficult.\r\nWe are all, because of when we were born - trained to
    think fixed. Trained to think, \"What is the size of the space I need to fill?\"\r\nBut
    what if you don't know? How do you design for a size unknown?\r\nTo me, trading
    that certainty for the ability to publish at least my words, instantly to the
    entire world, is more than fair.\r\n\r\nWe don't have the tools and concepts yet.
    I watch my five-year old grandson use the iPhone, iPod, and iPad - it's amazing
    to watch - he might be of the generation that \"gets it\" naturally. A change
    in the Zeitgeist is required.\r\n\r\nIf you are deeming the standards movement

  body: "As a print designer I tend to agree with Darell (Aluminum). If a client approaches
    us for a \"digital\" version, there is nothing simpler than to tell him \"well
    you already got a PDF\". On request, I can even pimp it up with bookmarks and
    the occasional hyperlink.\r\n\r\n<em>However</em>, even fancy hyperlinking does
    not intrinsically <em>add</em> to the user experience; or, indeed, make any publication
    move \"up\" to a fully qualified e-publication. For that, we rebuild the document
    from scratch into The Best We Can Offer in HTML3. For the odd novel or something
    like that, the results are ... adequate. But any serious publication, including
    tables and illustrations, HTML3 as displayed in iBooks on the iPad (to name the
    one platform I am acquainted with), is not good enough.\r\n\r\nI don't care for
    page-flipping. What I <em>need</em> is more typesetting control: proper hyphenation,
    justification the way I want (the iPad seems to object), Keep With Next and Keep
    Paragraphs Together options for headings, figures which automatically float to
    the top or bottom of a page. And it goes without saying, I do like reader friendly
    options such as adjustable Font and Font Size. Hell, if I'd object to that I'd
    might as well stick to PDFs.\r\n\r\nWhat the industry needs is nothing like \"more
    HTML controls\", or \"better CSS support for print-type media\". What the industry
    needs to see is that an eBook reader is .. not a web page and neither a 1-to-1
    translation of printed pages. It needs a new Reading paradigm. Something in between."

    the endless previews of the Spider-Man musical in NYC, a reporter asked director

    was along the lines of \"I'm a director. That's WHAT I DO \u2014\_control things.\"\r\n\r\nAbsolutely
    right: Stage directors control things. TV writers control things. Novelists control
    things. And designers control things. Control is good. Control is what we like
    about the movies, musicals, TV shows, books, etc. that these people create.\r\n\r\nIn
    this case, the control \u2014 the \"stick in the behind\" that you refer to \u2014
    is the tradition of print typography. And you know what? I like that tradition.
    I imagine we all do. And if \"removing the stick,\" as you say, had led to a new
    approach to the design of electronic publications, I'd be all for it.\r\n\r\nBut
    it hasn't. Mostly what it's led to is a state of no control, a state of non-design.
    If the ebooks that I got from Amazon looked like the ones I saw in Harry Potter,
    I'd say great \u2014\_no reason to worry. But they don't. They stink. Whereas
    the PDFs I get from O'Reilly? They look great. They look like books. They read
    like books. Sure, I wish they had better functionality. But they're a lot closer

    at honoring the skill set of graphic designers and typographers everywhere, and
    thereby failing to preserve an important part of the pleasure of reading. Typography
    is getting washed away by the tide of declining expectations. \r\n\r\nOr, if you
    disagree, what other conclusion should I draw from the available evidence? For
    instance, webfonts. I mean \u2014\_where are they? I don't see them on any major
    websites. I don't even see them on Typophile.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to pick a
    fight with you in particular Richard. I just think that at some point, the HTML/CSS
    standards crowd has to be held to account. No, I don't think 15 years is too soon."
