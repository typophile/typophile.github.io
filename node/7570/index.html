If I do the Windows one, I&#39;ll probably want to use GDI&#43;, which is only supported natively on XP &#40;there is a DLL for earlier Windows versions, but I&#39;m not sure how well it works&#41;. I&#39;m also tempted to use the HIView compositing feature of Mac OSX, which would make it require 10.2 or higher.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I followed your original thread on this closely, and have given it a lot of thought. As an editing/development environment, I think something based on Cornu curves is a great idea. One fundamental problem that plagues PostScript style outlines is that it is difficult to get a nice smooth transition from a straight to a curve. Working with a Cornu curve &#40;a.k.a. Cornu spiral&#41; would seem to be a great way to deal with that. <BR> <BR>That being said, making your own editor for this is really not a great solution for most font developers--though it makes a great proof of concept. The idea would need to be adopted by mainstream font editing applications such as FontLab and DTL FontMaster. <BR> <BR>I for one would be happy to play with a prototype editor once you get turnkey installation for Mac or Windows, and would probably strongly encourage the font editor folks to look at it. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Laurence: is it possible you don&#39;t have /sw/bin in your path? Fink requires you to run /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh or the moral equivalent. <BR> <BR>Assuming you&#39;ve already got that covered and it is another problem, try the <a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/ppedit-pantherbin.tar.gz">binary</a> I compiled. It will probably work better if you run it from inside an xterm than from Terminal.app. <BR> <BR>hrant: I&#39;m not deeply familiar with that API, but an off-the-top-of-my-head guess is that it would be fairly straightforward to write a batch converting tool, but probably not easy at all to integrate it at the level of the interactive curve editor. <BR> <BR>Thomas: I&#39;m glad you&#39;re interested in the Cornu curves; obviously you&#39;ve got a lot of sway in the community. That said, perhaps you could enlighten me exactly how I benefit from having the &#34;mainstream font editors&#34; appropriate my ideas. There&#39;s a lot more that I want to do besides the Cornu curve, including optical scaling and revisiting Metafont-like controls. The only way I can see not to be at the mercy of developers in a somewhat marginal niche is to code it myself, possibly with collaboration from the free software world.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph: <BR> <BR>It depends on your objectives. I can understand why you might not be interested in the mainstream font editors using your ideas without you controlling/directing the implementation. <BR> <BR>My own interest in supporting this technology would be to have it really mainstream and something I could rely on. If it&#39;s not in mainstream tools, and requires storing the master outlines in what is essentially a non-standard format, then my interest becomes largely academic. I don&#39;t think I would want to risk ending up with my outline data in an unsupported format that I can&#39;t get at, some years down the road. Not everyone will feel the same way, of course, but I imagine a lot of folks will. <BR> <BR>Maybe you can get more out of this yourself if you develop it all on your own. But there probably isn&#39;t a lot &#34;in it for you&#34; no matter how you play it. Font editing tools is not a very profitable area to go into. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s more a matter of control rather than profit, then maybe something like teaming up with the FontForge folks is the best way to go. <BR> <BR>Best of luck with it, no matter what you decide to do. It is a really interesting idea. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas: <BR> <BR>Thanks for your clear explanation of your concerns in adopting a new technology. In the free software community, we also have concerns about becoming dependent on proprietary formats. This is one reason, for example, why we have enthusiastically adopted PDF but not Flash. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not 100% sure what my objectives are. As you say, it&#39;s very unlikely that anybody can become rich developing new font technology. At this point, I&#39;m more concerned with recognition than making money off the idea. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s one specific outcome I would like to avoid, though. I would be very disappointed if one of the major font editor developers introduced Cornu curves into their product without credit to me. Since I haven&#39;t pursued a patent or anything, there is no legal reason not to. <BR> <BR>I must admit that when I first read your 8 Nov comment, I was rubbed the wrong way by what I read as condescention: &#34;it&#39;s ok  for you to play with these curves, but when it comes to using them in the real world, you better leave that to the big guys.&#34; I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not what you meant to convey, so I&#39;ll try to stay focussed on the concrete issues. <BR> <BR>As far as the risks of being locked into a proprietary format, I feel there are three things I can do: <BR> <BR>&#42; Fully document the file format and the underlying algorithms to process it. This part is easy, as I am writing up the ideas in a PhD thesis, and I am designing the file format to be particularly easy to parse and manipulate. <BR> <BR>&#42; Release the core code as free software, guaranteeing that it will stay alive so long as there is interest in the community. I am seriously considering releasing the code in a hybrid model, where the Linux version is truly free software, but the Win32 and Mac versions have proprietary UI code, including refinements such as making cut/paste interact transparently with apps such as Illustrator. <BR> <BR>&#42; Develop batch converters to standard file formats such as OpenType, so that in the worst case people who develop the font as Cornu curves will have to do follow-on work in a standard tool. <BR> <BR>For just drawing curves, such a batch converter should work fine, but to take advantage of the planned optical scaling and meta capabilities &#40;such as continuously varying extender length&#41;, it will by necessity &#34;freeze&#34; these parameters into the curve. <BR> <BR>Having you as a champion of these ideas could be a <i>very</i> good thing. Hopefully I can allay some of your concerns about getting trapped into an unsupported file format, and you can allay some of my concerns about recognition, and to make sure that the full package of ideas including optical scaling has a chance to live, rather than being crushed by a &#34;good enough&#34; hack of the Cornu curve into legacy font tools. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll probably prepare a native OSX Carbon demo some time in the next couple of weeks. I&#39;m sure we will pick up this discussion after you get a chance to play with it - assuming my experience is representative, font designers will flock to Cornu curves and refuse to go back to the bad old days of Beziers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suspect Thomas was simply saying: Don&#39;t get your hopes up too much. <BR>Such a cautious approach is something natural to me too - on the other hand that&#39;s probably why you&#39;ll end up releasing some great and useful font editing software &#40;or at least utility&#41; and I won&#39;t. Good luck! <BR> <BR>&#62; font designers will flock to Cornu curves and refuse to go back <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s <i>that</i> much better, many people might indeed gladly give up the comforts of what they&#39;re used to. But note how much general resistance there is to switching from Fontographer to FontLab, even though almost everybody agrees/admits that the latter is much better in almost every way; and the difference between them is probably less than the difference between either and Cornu spline editing!  :-/ <BR> <BR>It seems to me that a good tactic in terms of getting a solid initial base of users would be to target people who are still using Fontographer, but have developed the need to switch to something else &#40;FontLab being the most obvious choice&#41;. Since this group of people has already given in to the idea of change, they might very well form your best user foundation. And there are a lot of them, as evidenced by the demand for Cabarga&#39;s FontLab quickie-learning book. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>But note how much general resistance there is to switching from Fontographer to FontLab...</i> <BR> <BR>Two years ago, I would have said that was the case, because many people who were familiar with Fontographer wanted similar drawing tools in FontLab, which they now have. Since FontLab 4.6 was released, almost everyone I know has switched to it, except for a few die-hard FontStudio fans. There seems to me now very little resistance to switching from Fontographer to FontLab.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, <BR> <BR>Glad I was able to explain myself better. I really don&#39;t want to discourage you from developing your ideas, certainly hope you get credited for them, and really wasn&#39;t trying to be condescending. I was just trying to explain why it is that I&#39;d need them in FontLab to be useful to me personally, and why a lot of the professional type dev community would probably be thinking the same way. <BR> <BR>Honestly, this is one of the couple of coolest new ideas I&#39;ve heard for type development tools in this decade. Please forgive me for wanting it to be integrated into the tools I use daily.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>That being said, I think that both Hrant and John are right. On the one hand, the pro type dev community has really come around to FontLab lately. On the other hand, there are still a lot of people using Fontographer, especially those who don&#39;t do this full time, or are strictly doing the glyph design part of things and not final production. <BR> <BR>Finally, although diversity and competition is good, I have difficulty imagining that either FontForge or a brand-new-from-scratch program is going to be really competitive with FontLab any time soon. I&#39;m just thinking that it&#39;s a ton of work and a certain amount of polishing time that is needed, and that it&#39;s not feasible to get there in just a year or two. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

It might not be worth it to you, but on the other hand it might be. After all, you are going to do a lot of the work for the PhD anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">William: <BR> <BR>I did consider patenting the idea, but basically decided that the return probably wouldn&#39;t outweigh the costs. In my experience, getting companies to license technology is very much an uphill battle. I&#39;ve had some success with my screening technologies, but there&#39;s an area where big printer companies invest millions of dollars each to develop the technology in-house, and my stuff is just as good and well within reach of smaller companies. But when it comes to licensing technology that breaks truly new ground &#40;for example, my algorithm for suppressing moire using conventional dot shapes&#41;, I&#39;ve had basically no success at all. <BR> <BR>Of course, I could be passing up the opportunity to become fabulously wealthy off the idea, in which case I&#39;ll just have to file it with all the other missed opportunities :<a href="http://localhost/"></a>&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My mistake: Raph&#39;s got a whole year after publication &#40;in the USA anyway&#41;. Or so it seems. <BR> <BR>In any case, his list of the three things he can do seems very cool and apropos. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not going to be online much the next few days. Just made an offer on a house tonight, am having guests for the rest of the weekend, yadda yadda. I hope I get a chance to play with Raph&#39;s drawing tools soon, but since I don&#39;t have the right setup &#40;yet&#41;, I will have to wait a while. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, one thing to note about the makers of font software is that -- with the exception of Macromedia, who are not doing anything with Fontographer anyway -- these are all small, developer-run companies. FontLab is currently the most successful of these, but its still just a few guys in St Petersburg, Russia, coding away. In this respect, they are not too far removed from your own situation, and I think you would find them friendly and open to new ideas, as I have.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph, it just occurred to me that if drawing with your curves is as sweet as John Whipple says, they may have an application in Illustrator and other drawing programs, which is a huge market compared to font development. <BR> <BR>So for that purpose you might want to rethink about filing a patent. Then you could explore the market as an add on in Illustrator or other drawing programs. Traditionally draftsmen did use &#39;French curves&#39;, and Illustrator does have a spiral drawing tool, but I suspect not at all as useful and easy to use as yours, with your &#39;spinners&#39;, though I haven&#39;t used either one.  <BR> <BR>Also again on terminology, I think that you could say that &#39;Levien&#39; curves are sections of the Cornu spiral selected or drawn using your methodology. Ok, it is better if someone else, such as the buyer of your stuff, makes the choice of terminology, but here it is from a third disinterested party as a suggestion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>...may have an application in Illustrator and other drawing programs, which is a huge market compared to font development.</i> <BR> <BR>This is oh so very true. Developing this even as plugin for Illustrator would be cool or &#40;keeping it Free&#41; an extension on Inkscape&#39;s tools would be awesome. <BR> <BR>Levien curves definitely, and can your university help you secure a patent or is that crazy talk? <BR> <BR>I like B-Spline tools like the one in Expressions 3 &#40;Formerly Creature House now M$ free download&#41;. Clicking three points is the same model. This also has a Bezier Pen and a &#34;Polyline&#34; pen which is a combo straight-segment and B-Spline tool. <BR> <BR>Illustrator&#39;s spiral tool is okay, but I haven&#39;t really used it much. It draws spirals only, as distinct from crurves derived from spirals. Drawing spirals is easier in ppedit &#40;please change the name... ;-&#41;&#41; and S curves and curves that are sections of ovals.  <BR> <BR>Oh and I meant &#39;rooted&#39; or &#39;full screen&#39; mode in my earlier post. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everybody for all the awesome feedback, especially the screenshots and patches! <BR> <BR>Robin: you&#39;ll be happy to know that my current working codebase can insert and delete knots. I&#39;ll probably make another release later today. Your &#39;E&#39; generally looks good, but definitely has more knots than it needs. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/spiro.png">screenshot</a> of the lowercase 72pt metal Centaur &#39;e&#39; I&#39;m working on. <BR> <BR>Hrant: I think it&#39;s best to enforce the extrema in the conversion from high-res outlines to the specific font format. Of course, you&#39;re going to get quantization error when you do so, but I don&#39;t see any good way to avoid that. Side note: does anyone know of a downside to using 4096/em when generating TT outlines? &#40;With Type1, you can cheat on the precision by using the div operator&#41; <BR> <BR>The OSX port is coming along &#40;right now it can load files and display outlines, but not yet edit them interactively&#41;. The last few days, I&#39;ve been giving more attention to much needed UI improvements, though. I&#39;ve been tracing 72pt metal Centaur miniscules, which is of course a pretty good real-world test. I&#39;m also willing to do the Windows port myself, but coding <i>does</i> take time. If someone with good Win32 coding skills wants to volunteer, I&#39;ll gratefully accept. <BR> <BR>Last but not least: I&#39;ve tentatively chosen the name &#34;Spiro&#34; for the project. At least it&#39;s an improvement over &#34;ppedit&#34;.</div>

A Triangle or X mark would be nice. In fact it might be better that using extrema interactively. <BR> <BR>Steve I like both the Spirograph and Agnew references even if unintended, but that&#39;s just me. <BR> <BR>What about Curve Master Curvilicious or Curvaluscious?

		<div class="commentbody">Sergej: thanks for your comments. I appreciate negative feedback as much as positive. Well, <i>almost</i> as much :<a href="http://levien.com/"></a>&#41; <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the deal about straight-to-curve transitions. The Cornu spiral can do a very good job with them, but my program does not <i>yet</i> automatically find the curve parameters to fit this case. You can fit by hand if you&#39;re willing to do some nudging of points &#40;and perhaps add an additional knot or two beyond what Sergei had&#41;, but ultimately my feeling is that this is something the computer should be able to solve for you. <BR> <BR>My sense is that Ikarus got the UI issues about right. In addition to the curve and corner points present in my code now, Ikarus also has the concept of a &#34;tangent point&#34;, which is used primarily to join straights to curves. I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ll add that third knot type, with behavior similar &#40;probably not identical&#41; to Ikarus. <BR> <BR>That said, the mathematics of the straight/curve transition are devilishly difficult. I have about a couple dozen papers printed out now that directly address the problem of fitting a smooth interpolating spline, but none really address the issue of a straight/curve transition directly. The best result I&#39;ve seen so far is Moreton&#39;s work with MVC&#39;s &#40;minimum variation of curvature&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You are welcome, Raph. I took your advice to heart, but eventually <a href="http://dreamer.nitro.dk/temp/ppedit-drive3.png">my patience run out</a>. Ahem. <BR> <BR>On a second attempt I got <a href="http://dreamer.nitro.dk/temp/ppedit-drive4.png">what I wanted</a>. &#40;This particular serif style is one I might use for my typeface.&#41; Once you know where to put points the contour shaping becomes manageable and not as hard as it seems at first, but the current approach is still unnecessarily painful. As you say, there needs to be a third knot type. That said, I don&#39;t see the advantage of using your curves instead of Bezier&#39;s in this particular case. Do you? &#40;I&#39;ll try drawing letter U later.&#41; <BR> <BR>I think your curves have interesting dynamics. If you have a series of points and you change one, the curve changes between them all. Reminds me of wave propagation. With Bezier curves one is used to the curve between neighbouring points to stay the same. With quadratic curves also the neighbours are effected. So, the results of drawing with your curves are harder to predict, though I&#39;m not saying that I don&#39;t like it that way. Predictability is overrated anyway. Another thing is that one doesn&#39;t have to worry about curves not being round. That&#39;s what I referred to when I said drawing the same D in FontLab felt kind of lame. This is a very nice property. So, yes, I agree with your original statement that it&#39;s faster to make </div>
