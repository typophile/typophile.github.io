  years, probably longer.\r\n\r\nThe closest match I can find is Rockwell Bold, though
  the Rockwell serifs are too large and the letters M and G are completely different.\r\n\r\nWould
  love to know the correct typeface being used in the Bellingham sign.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BellinghamSign_6442.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/G_5948.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/M_4915.png]"

  body: "I suggest that this is lettering is loosely based on the Clarendon style.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClarendonTextBoldInUse_6426.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/\r\nThe
    weight of this specimen is slightly heavier than your letters but you can see
    the similar letterforms. Clip off the bottom spur of G and it looks very much
    like your letter G.\r\nShorten all the serifs. Clip the serifs on the center stroke
    of E. Add serifs to the top of A. Raise the crotch of M and make it pointed. Compress
    width to match your letters.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Don!\r\nI'm trying to decide which style (Clarendon or Rockwell) I
    would need to do less surgery on.\r\nI'll need to raise the crossbar on the H
    in either case, as well as mess with the M.\r\nClarendon G is closer than Rockwell.
    (Clarendon = remove spur, Rockwell = extend serif AND counter plus other tweaking.)\r\nClarendon
    has more curvy fillets than I need, most noticeable in the L and E. \r\nBut it
    looks like this was probably freehanded back in the day, and doesn't match any
    typeface exactly.\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n- Jennifer\r\n"
