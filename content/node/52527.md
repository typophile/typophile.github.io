  there is a full set of fonts I can find with other letters of the same style.\r\n\r\nThanks

    it's also their official government logo: http://alberta.ca however, their website
    is very nice looking... so, whomever designed the logo originally (back in '84
    or prior from my findings) must have had some serious clout in the Alberta government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
