  work. I tested them though on Mac and Windows.\r\n\r\nBasically, this involved installing
  it. Using it for a day or two. Uninstalling it. Throwing into gsrbage or bin.\r\n\r\nAlomhg
  came Vista. I no longer can uninstall a font or delete it.\r\n\r\nMy font menus
  are full of differen versions, and my folt folder is getting fatter and fatter.\r\n\r\nHow
  can I do such a simple thing like remove a font from font folder and delete it? "

    and obviously wouldn't be worth the cost if you only use it for part-time use.\r\n\r\nLinotype
    used to have a windows beta of their Linotype font Xlporer X, which would let
    you enable and disable fonts without having to install/uninstall systemwide.\r\n\r\nYou
    may be familiar with the mac version of this software.  I'm not sure if they're
    currently distributing the free windows version or not, but I'm sure there are
    copies of it floating around out there.  I also don't know how well it works on
    vista, but it could be just what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"

    can delete fonts, but nothing takes effect.\r\n\r\ni'm thinking to create fake

    understand, knowing what I know now, how people manage to develop or produce professional
    work on a toy operating system who's biggest selling feature is running games.\r\n\r\nThe
    ability on Linux and Mac to simply pop a folder with fonts into your ~/.fonts/
    or ~/Library/fonts/ folder and have the fonts show up and be usable, and then
    to simply remove them and have them gone is beautiful.  I never understood this
    whole font 'installation' thing, or allowing the computer to have control over
    such a simple procedure.\r\n\r\nI hope you find a solution that suits you gohebrew,
    but thanks for sharing this too, I will share your experience with new designers
    thinking of getting Vista laptops bcause they're 'cheaper'."

  body: "I have FontExplorer installed on my Mac, but I mostly just use it for previewing
    uninstalled fonts and cleaning the font caches. I don't use it for activating/deactivating
    fonts very often. (If I were doing \"normal\" design work instead of making fonts,
    the situation might be different.)\r\n\r\nI have all my fonts organized into folders
    for each family on a separate volume. To install a font, I simply copy a folder
    of fonts into the ~/Library/Fonts. To uninstall, just delete the folder.\r\n\r\nA
    lot of people don't realize it, but you can put fonts into folders and sub-folders
    in the /Fonts folder. You can organize it however you like. No need to leave everything
    dumped out loose at the top level.\r\n\r\nFont managers do have some benefits,
    but a lot of people have forgotten why Suitcase was such a success when it was
    first released on Mac System 6 back in the Eighties: It enabled you to install
    more than 256 fonts at one time. Each bitmap size of each font style counted as
    a font, so this was a big problem, and Suitcase solved it. The other reason was
    that you normally had to restart when you installed new fonts. Suitcase fixed
    this as well. Most of the other features were simply ways for Suitcase and its
    competitors to differentiate themselves in the market.\r\n\r\nBut we don't have
    the 256 font limit or the restart problems anymore that Suitcase and similar utilities
    were originally designed to solve. Things like auto-activation can be very useful,
    but these utilities are not nearly as essential as they once were."
