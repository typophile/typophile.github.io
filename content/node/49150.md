  body: "Spencer, I don't think it's Futura Condesed. \r\nIt feels closer to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=charcoal|Charcoal]]
    but that's not it either. \r\nMy first response was it's one of those fonts that
    comes with your computer! \r\n(a category that Lucida falls into as well)\r\nGood

    but the shape of the C isn't quite right. The System fonts idea made me think
    of Techno on the Mac, but the C is all wrong for starters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
