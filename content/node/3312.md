  timid about posting anything here for fear of being ripped to shreds, but you don&#39;t
  learn without some mistakes along the way huh? Anyhow, here are two projects i&#39;ve
  been playing with &#40;thats what type design is for me. i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll
  be able to tell!&#41; <BR>The first, Seventies Schoolbook, is based on letterforms
  that i first saw as a kid in elementary school on some reading textbooks. The second
  is based on letterforms drawn to illustrate a book called &#34;Aha, Gotcha!&#34;
  Both are in the very formative stages, but i thought i&#39;d post here to get yer
  feedback as to whether either of these projects have artistic merit and whether
  i should spend any more time working on them. Both are missing characters, i&#39;m
  more concerned about Digitize tho, because the letterforms are all variations of
  highly stylized numerals, but i haven&#39;t quite figgered out how to manipulate
  the basic forms to create suitable glyphs for K,P,Q &amp; Y. Anyhow, without further
  ado...<!--attachment: RoughPass-27238.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*24.1*My+First+Critique+Projects*RoughPass%2epdf

  body: Hey, the top one is actually pretty cool! It looks like a really wild version
    of this typical 70s font &#40;I forget the name&#41;. <BR> <BR>The bottom one
    is &#34;cute&#34;, but the era of nonletters-as-letters has been gone too recently
    to be interesting. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Martin Gardner&#39;s numbers/letters aren&#39;t they? If they&#39;re not,
    I&#39;ve seen them in one of his books. Don&#39;t think they&#39;re a full font.
    I&#39;m wondering how you intend to handle the A/a and B/b, which don&#39;t appear
    in number names until 1,000 and 1,000,000,000.

  body: 'It&#39;s pretty straightforward to make a 2 into Q simply by extending the
    top bit around until it gets close to the tail. &#40;this works best in handwritings
    where the 2 is closer to the Devanagari 2 numeral form: <a href="http://omniglot.com/writing/devanagari.htm"

  body: 'Thanks for the input, guys. I guess the digits are fairly 80s huh? I guess
    thats a little bit of nostalgia for me then and with the 80s styles back on the
    rise... maybe this one will be interesting again &#40;and then again, maybe not&#41;
    <BR>Darren, i tried to &#34;solve&#34; as many of the glyph issues as i could.
    I&#39;ll post a sample. Obviously some of my solutions don&#39;t &#34;work&#34;
    as well as others. <BR><!--attachment: DigitzFull-27288.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*11.3**DigitzFull%2epdf

    <BR>One thing i&#39;ve thought about doing with this one is to slightly tweak
    out the basic letterforms to make them fit each letter better, but i&#39;d want
    it to be something subtle if i did that. Anyhow, just a few things i&#39;ve been
    playing with. <BR>Hmmm, a 2 for a Q, why didn&#39;t I think of that??? i&#39;ll
    see if i can work it with what i&#39;ve got. Then again maybe i&#39;ll play with
    the forms and really &#34;own&#34; them!'

  body: Well, obviously the Y could use the same glyph of the 4, like you did with
    the 6/G, and the 2 suggestion by Shreyas is very good. I disagree with Hrant,
    the whole feeling of Digitize is something way beyond &#34;numbers as letters&#34;,
    it&#39;s &#34;letters as numbers&#34; as well, and back again. I think it is very
    intriguing. <BR>Whi don&#39;t you call it &#34;Digitease&#34;, the sound is similar
    and it could mean Digitize, Digi-tease, and Digit-ease at the same time. <IMG
