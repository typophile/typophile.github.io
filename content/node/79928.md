body: "This may be something I should ultimately just let go of and hope nobody notices
  the result, but I'm noticing that when I generate an OTF from FontLab, and test
  it in OpenOffice, kerning is only applied to the glyphs in Latin-1. Though they
  are in the same class, \xC1 kerns but \u0100 doesn't. Is this a limitation I should
  just expect, or is it an aspect of how I've generated my font that I can correct
  somehow?"

  body: "OpenType class kerning isn't supported very well by Office applications in
    general. But usually kerning is turned off by default in Office applications,
    so it\u2019s quite unlikely anyone will notice. I'd just leave it as it is.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option would be to expand the class kerning and write a \xBBplain\xAB kern table
    into the font. But expanding the class kerning may result in a lot of kern pairs,
    and the limit that can be used is somewhere over 10000, and you lose all the advantages
    of kerning classes."

  body: "As OTF fonts do not normally contain a \"kern\" table, only GPOS kerning,
    the Adobe font driver in Windows (part of Windows GDI) and ATM on Mac OS 9 expands
    the GPOS kerning into a flat table and subsets it for Latin-1. Applications that
    do not process OpenType Layout features use that kerning. \r\n\r\nIt's very likely
    that on Linux, FreeType works similarly. \r\n\r\nOpenOffice does not, AFAIK, process
    OpenType Layout features in fonts. \r\n\r\nAs Jens points out, one way to work
    around the problem is to generate both GPOS kerning and the old-style plain \"kern\"
    table kerning (this is controlled in Preferences / Generating OpenType & TrueType
    / Kerning). The maximum number of \"kern\" table kerning pairs is 10920, and this
    is the maximum limit you should enter in \"Limit total number...\" there. \r\n\r\n<em>Technical
    background: Each pair in the \"kern\" table takes 6 bytes, there is a 14-byte
    header, and the maximum size of a subtable is 64K bytes, so (65536-14)/6 gives
    you 10920. Most font engines only support a \"kern\" table with one subtable,
    so there's the limit.</em>\r\n\r\nThis might help, provided that the font driver
    actually looks for the \"kern\" table in OTF fonts, which may or may not be true,
    depending on the operating system you're using OpenOffice in. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
