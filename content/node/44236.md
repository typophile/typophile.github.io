  there a better way to do this?"

    works well. You can then type fast and work fast (I am not using FontLab but there
    is no reason this should not work with FontLab).\r\n\r\n"

    of simply copying a glyph into the metric window, without the user diddling with
    invisible spaces, actual spaces and the confounded slash marks, the \"next\",
    (cmmd-]), is the only truly headache-proof method. This is particularly slow when
    kerning large OT glyph sets, and so those who are serious, must carefully sequence
    the glyphs in their fonts.  It'd be sweet if one could paste a glyph into the
    metric window's glyph cells, as opposed to the text line, but that'd cause work
    somewhere. Amazingly, Fontographer succeeded into the post-256-glyph-limit world
    without a text line in the metrics window, but that success is a deep dark secret
    not to be revealed here. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    \r\n\r\nActually, you can, though the way it works is not very obvious (big surprise):
    Switch to the \"text mode\" in the Metrics window. Then you can copy glyphs from
    the Font window and paste them into the Metrics glyph display area (as opposed
    to the text line). You switch to \"text mode\" in the Metrics window using the
    button just before the \"preview mode\" button. Unfortunately, you need to switch
    back to \"metrics mode\" or \"kerning mode\" to make adjustments, so it's not
    quite as seamless as the Fontographer implementation. Although it does allow you
    to insert a glyph when you paste, rather than replacing."
