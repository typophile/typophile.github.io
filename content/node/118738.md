  a couple fonts similar but nothing exact. \r\n\r\nI'm also interested in how they

    The letters and numbers are small but they may be produced on a square grid. Are
    you able to count the pixels in the grid?\r\nDick's similar font has glyphs build
    on a grid of 10 wide by 14 high and seems a little too wide.\r\nNo match so far
    but here is another similar font. But it seems to be either too narrow or too
