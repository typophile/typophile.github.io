body: "Not being a professional type designer or typographer myself, it is possible
  that my tastes require educating.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, I've looked through
  various specimen books of typefaces in search of the typeface which most perfectly,
  in my mind, fulfills the \"crystal goblet\" dictum of Beatrice Warde. Garamond,
  Caslon, Caledonia, Times Roman, and even Century Expanded are all quite nice typefaces,
  but each of them has an individual personality that does call attention to itself
  to some extent.\r\n\r\nInstead, I found that newspaper faces like Corona an Aurora
  (but not, say, Ionic No. 5) seemed, if not for their tiny descenders and large x-height,
  to embody the \"average\" forms of the letters that readers expect - particularly
  in the part of the lowercase letters that lies within the x-height area.\r\n\r\nWell,
  I've finally found the regular book faces which embody the same basic design that
  I like in Corona and Aurora.\r\n\r\nBell, Roman No. 1, and Oxford are those faces.\r\n\r\nBut
  there are objections to those faces for general use. Especially in Bell, but still
  present to a lesser extent in Oxford, the digits have a peculiar form, the 2 especially
  being curly and slanted.\r\n\r\nBut there is something else, too. Perhaps I'm imagining
  it (hence the title of this post). It looks like those faces are... distressed.
  Not to the extent of Fifteenth Century (aka \"Caslon Antique\") - and distressed
  may not be the right word. Instead of the face being made to look like the type
  is beat-up, it is just that the shapes are made less regular and uniform, to give
  a punch-cut appearance rather than a pantographic appearance to the face.\r\n\r\nToday,
  to the general reader who is not of refined typographic tastes, this, if present,
  would indeed be a fatal objection to widespread general use of a face, and even
  more so to its \"invisibility\"."

  body: "According to recent research, people find that an averaged (blended) image
    of two faces is more attractive than either of them.\r\nIIRC, Adrian Frutiger
    was interested in this effect of merging images.\r\n\r\nIt may be that what, in
    your own mind, you find most closely corresponds to neutrality, is the average
    of what you are familiar with.\r\nSo if you are looking to appeal to the taste
    of the general reader, it would be the average of what they are exposed to.\r\n\r\nBut
    I wonder how change comes about. Perhaps it is because the average also takes
    into account the percentage of the population who are \"prosumers\", i.e. those
    of \"refined\" taste, who carry more clout than the bottom end (semi-illiterates).\r\n\r\nAnd
    bear in mind that those of refined taste (art directors, graphic designers, typographers)
    are pushing the issue, putting non-neutral trendy types into the mix that is seen,
    and averaged, by the general reader.\r\n\r\nTechnology, also, changes the mix
    -- I suspect there is a connection between the recent (last 20 years) retreat
    of serifed faces and the emergence of low-res reading devices."

  body: "Bell was recut by Monotype as a revival, and essentially a facsimile, of
    an 18th-century letter. Thus the irregularities that you perceive. I believe the
    digital version also seeks to retain this characteristic.\r\n\r\nOxford and Roman
    No. 1 (by which I take you to mean the Binny Pica Roman No. 1) are the same face.
    But I'm not sure what versions you are viewing. Oxford was a name later given
    to the Binny Pica Roman \u2014\_again, a late 18th-century face: punchcut, warts
    and all.\r\n\r\nLinotype cut Monticello as a revival of Binny/Oxford. And retaining
    the irregularities and inconsistencies was a <em>sine qua non</em> for Griffith
    and Conkwright in doing so.\r\n\r\nMatthew Carter's digital update of Monticello,
    likewise, continues to preserve these characteristics.\r\n\r\nCorona, on the other
    hand, was made unto itself, not a revival. It was, in fact, a culmination of the
    exploration of a certain hard-news style. As a result of the production environment
    it was destined for, all \u201Cirregularity\u201D was necessarily boiled out of
    the design. Same goes for Aurora, Imperial, Ideal, et al.\r\n\r\nAs Nick points
    out, \u201Caverage forms of letters that reader\u2019s expect\u201D is something
    of a moving target.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Corona was not a revival, I realize. It's just that certain aspects of the
    design seem to be a closer match to Bell in particular (and to a lesser extent
    Oxford and Monticello) than to, say, Century Expanded or Baskerville, let alone
    Caledonia or Times Roman.

  body: "@kentlew:\r\nI should indeed have made my point clear.\r\n\r\nMy first question,
    which was obvious and less implicit, has been answered: Bell and Oxford are indeed
    intentionally made to look punchcut instead of pantographed.\r\n\r\nMy other questions
    should have been stated explicitly, and then my point would have been clear.\r\n\r\nThe
    next question was: am I mistaken in thinking that Corona does have something in
    common with Bell - while the two faces are different in their purpose, and their
    x-height, is there indeed an important quality which they share? (What I think
    I admire about the two faces is the proportions and shapes of the lowercase letters
    - ignoring ascender and descender height, which can be changed easily enough.)\r\n\r\nAnd,
    if that question is answered to the effect that the two faces do have something
    in common, what other faces share that? (One answer might be, I suspect, the wider
    and heavier Scotch Romans of the early 19th Century, as opposed to the narrow
    and lighter ones that came later, which, to me at least, gave Scotch Roman a bad
    name.)\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I will further note that I have the good fortune
    to own a copy of the Blue Ribbon Books edition (not the first edition, but a less-expensive
    reprint) of Secret and Urgent by Fletcher Pratt.\r\n\r\nI had assumed the book
    was perhaps typeset in Century Expanded, but that is not the case. Its typeface
    comes very close to my ideal of an \"invisible\" typeface - to someone who grew
    up when Century Expanded, Baskerville, Caledonia, and Garamond were in wide use
    for publishing, but Times Roman was still a novelty; a particularly beautiful
    face, but one that called attention to itself by being a bit too gorgeous and
    too modern.\r\n\r\nBut it had one defect - the letter H, in small capitals, was
    clearly wider than it should have been. This allowed me to at least tentatively
    identify the face - as the Linotype face known by the name \"Number Twenty-One\",
    thanks to \"The Type Specimen Book\" of V & M Typographical."

    are irregular only because the originals were. \"Object\" in that it doesn't address
    why the originals were irregular -- the implication being they either didn't know
    better, didn't have the skill, or didn't have the technology.\r\n\r\nAny aesthetic,
    whether in pure art -- a piece of music, a painting, or in the design of a more
    practical object -- a car, a typeface, falls between complete order and chaos.
    Complete order is boring, chaos not understandable. It is easy to avoid chaos.
    Boredom, on the other hand. . .\r\n\r\nPerhaps the 18th and 19th century type

  body: "I haven't forgotten how Donald Knuth found it necessary to make a travesty
    of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, a reference to the lecture which introduced
    TeX and METAFONT to the world; he showed how different values for a 'randomness'
    factor would affect the appearance of type - which he illustrated with the word
    \"mathematics\". And then he joked that he had one more thing to say - partly
    because he did not want people to be able to accuse him of ending his lecture
    by making a travesty of mathematics!\r\n\r\nHaving a bit of irregularity in a
    typeface, then, can of course be seen as making it warmer, more natural, and organic.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    as my goal is an \"invisible\" typeface in the crystal goblet sense, and as irregularity
    had <strong>very definitely</strong> fallen out of fashion, as opposed to pantographic
    perfection, in the period of time (1950-1965) relative to which I am seeking to
    find or create a nondescript typeface, while some design elements of Bell might
    be useful to its quest, sadly though it may be, its irregularity definitely is
    <strong>not</strong>: that would be noticeable and jarring to the reader, not
    \"invisible\".\r\n\r\nI'm not saying Bell was irregular because they couldn't
    do any better - after all, Baskerville already existed - or, on the other hand,
    that Century Expanded was free of irregularity because they had meretricious tastes
    over at ATF. Mechanical perfection does demand quality craftsmanship, and is legitimately
    appealing to the eye in appropriate contexts - and the printing of the 20th century
    largely was such a context.\r\n\r\nIn that connection, I can still remember the
    visual impact of a book set in Times Roman back in the days when that was a rarity
    (i.e. the first edition of <em>The Codebreakers</em> by David Kahn) and before
    the face became ubiquitous. A return to a somewhat older style of face might give
    the eyes a rest, and let Times get some of its mojo back."
