  body: I would agree with that. They&#39;ve been using that for a very long time.
    I&#39;ve got some old Macs in the basement. I&#39;ll be right back...

  body: '...yep. Sorry it took so long. I had to empty the dehumidifier while I was
    down there. The early Macs had black Helvetica caps in the upper left corner of
    the keys. From the SE and Mac II on, it&#39;s been Univers 57 Condensed Oblique
    caps in the lower left corner all the way.'

  body: Funny to read you about Newton, I was on your newton server less than 15 mn
    ago! <BR> <BR>I remember to have seen David Berlow &#40;Font Bureau&#41; using
    such gadget during ATypI Reading, back 1997? possible or just dream?

  body: Jean, that is quite a coincidence! How did you manage to find yourself there?
    <BR> <BR>The Newton was originally released in 1993 &#40;discontinued in 1998&#41;,
    so it&#39;s very probable that Mr Berlow was using one at that particular ATypI.
    On a related note, at last year&#39;s TypeCon, I was showing Mark Simonson how
    I had converted his <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/oldbitmapfonts.html">old
    hand-tuned bitmap fonts</a> to work on my own Newton.

  body: I don&#39;t understand why the letters can&#39;t be bigger and bolder. I have
    the black keyboard that came with early G4s and it can be really hard to read
    &#40;and smudge easily&#41;. If it weren&#39;t for the little bump on the F and
    the J I&#39;d be lost.

  body: Reading letters in current Apple Alu laptops is not easy, and the light behind
    them never fit/contrast the light of your screen or the place where you are. The
    Ti ones where more simple and effective. <BR> <BR>The black keyboard with white
    letters is still better!
