    What do you think?"

  body: "Eames Century Modern is closer to New Century Schoolbook (which is more ornate
    than your sample), but I can't argue with House Industries (just over the Delaware
    border from me), and its a nice upgrade from Bookman.\r\n\r\nAnything would be
    a vast improvement over that over-reproduced, sorry original."
