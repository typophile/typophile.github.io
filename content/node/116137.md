  I am looking for.\r\n\r\nFor a food chain, family-oriented / \"for the crowd\" kind
  of demographic, and I guess it will be in a certain shade of red (like ketchup.)
  Its commercial advertisments are usually depicting joy when being inside the establishment
  or patronizing their merchandise.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest? I am more leaning towards
  san serif typefaces since it is a tagline of sorts (can't say the tagline really,
  but something that in service with joy.)\r\n\r\nAny help, guide and/or suggestions
  would be much appreciated!"

  body: "\"Happy\" is pretty subjective but I suppose it has about the same effect
    as cute, or rounded, and avoiding a sterile mechanical style like Helvetica. For
    a sans try Yummo http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/yummo/\r\nBut why restrict
    your choices to a sans?\r\nFor example check out Laura Worthington's fat hybrid
    _Ganache _ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/ganache/\r\nOr fairy
    tales handwritten roman letters like Besley Hand http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juraj-chrastina/besley-hand/\r\nThink
    outside the box.\r\nBTW \"happy\" and \"serious\" seem to be incompatible as font
    criteria. But I can see \"happy\" and well designed as a great combination.\r\nDon"

  body: "Strange \u2013 why does he want this to be \"serious\"? My only guess is
    he doesn't want it to look retarded-happy, like maybe this: http://media.chick-fil-a.com/Media/Img/catalog/Pressroom/ImageLibrary/logos/Chick-fil-A-logo-sm.jpg?download=true\r\n\r\nIn
    my view the main things that make a font friendly/happy are weight, width and
    a large x-height; it can have serifs, as long as their not delicate; and some
    controlled irregularity might help here too.\r\n\r\nSo what about this?\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/swagg/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@donshottype\r\n------------------------\r\nThank you for articulating it
    better, but I do think that is why the client went to ask help to get the idea
    to be well designed.\r\n\r\nI think my client said 'serious' because he wanted
    it to look as something presentable for corporate purposes, sort of consistency
    and legibility or cleanliness in the font. 'Happy' can be associated to the roundness
    of the edges of the glyphs maybe or \r\n\r\nYummo & Ganache do seem to have the
    looks but i dunno what to make of it. The former has its thickest weight still
    lacking in a little more weight and the latter leaning to whimsical. Even with
    these, I'll try to present it to the client. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAny other opinions,
    comments and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated."

  body: "@hrant\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nSame sentiments to why he wants
    it \"serious,\" but I agree that the client does not want it retard-happy haha!\r\n\r\nI
    agree with the weight & width, but I think the x-height can still vary, really
    depends on the typeface. Anyway, I am not closing it only on sans serifs; just
    that I lean towards it more.\r\n\r\nSwagg seems viable as an option too (especially
    the italics, which I haven't ventured in yet.) Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nFor
    both, @hrant & @donshottype\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\nAlso
    looking into other kinds of looks so yeah, outside-the-box thinking here as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    you thank you, but still open for more suggestions!\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThe client
    wanted the usual typeface used in their previous output so even though most of
    you suggested well-designed typefaces, the client just used where he was comfortable.
    To all, thank you for helping me today. Have a great day!\r\n\r\nFinal EDIT:\r\nThank
    you for the following:\r\n@J Weltin for suggesting Finnegan by J\xFCrgen Weltin\r\n@hrant
    for suggesting Swagg by Richard Miller\r\n@donshottype for suggesting Yummo by
    Ryoichi Tsunekawa & Ganache by  Laura Worthington"
