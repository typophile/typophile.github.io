  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Having become somewhat disillusioned with my book font project, I dug up an old attempt at fontmaking, "Catharsis Requiem", and started remaking it with the new knowledge on typography I had gathered in the meantime.  While the original was supposed to look serious and ceremonial, I moved from a humanist to a modern stroke to make a flashier and more glamourous font... <strong>Catharsis Glamour</strong>.  

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glamor_4964.png]

I intend to make a companion font, <strong>Catharsis Glory</strong>, with less contrast and possibly adnate serifs, for smaller text sizes and "tougher" environment. Also, it should be fairly easy to make different <strong>weights</strong> for these fonts, given their modular nature.  I will probably skip on the <strong>italic</strong> because the machine-created slanted version looks already quite usable to me.

Of course, I won't start with any of that until I've polished the base font a bit more.  What are your opinions and suggestions?

And in case you were wondering, this is the old precursor font, <strong>Catharsis Requiem</strong>:

		<div class="commentbody">One thing that might still be a problem is that I use two different strengths for the thin parts of the font. Serifs and the thin halves of arcs usually are 10 units (blue) while crossbars are 15 units (red). The ansae of |o|-like letters (red) also end up rather heavy-looking, although the thickness there was supposed to be 10 by design...  hm.

The main reason I did this was that the crossbars felt too flimsy to me.  Should I just man up and make them thin and uniform, or is it viable to keep it like this?

You're right, the |T| was too light, and as you predicted the heavy serifs from |Z, F| looked out of place as well. Instead, I now made the serifs on |T| as long as the ones on |Z, F|, but kept them tapered as before. Much better!

I also cleaned up the |w| of the thin weight, and the |ß| in all weights. 

Finally, I noticed the black weight hat some ungainly curves here and there, and proscribed some Pilates. It worked:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pilates_4588.png]

I do think I'm converging on a final form now. I feel tempted to add some ligatures (|Th| maybe? Or |T|+vowels and |r|?). Or even a set of interlocking ligatures for the fun of it...?

		<div class="commentbody">First thing I notice about the |n|s of Didot and Bodoni is the diagonal-ness of the shoulder. The right stem extends vertically up to almost the x-height, and the arch then drops down rather far on its way to the left stem.

For Glamour, I would prefer to keep more even-sided arches; domes rather than slanted roofs.  I realize this might make it harder to read, since it makes the tops of |n| and |o| look more similar than they need to be. On the other hand, that same similarity could also be seen as a consistent style. Is that a viable course of action?

I took some other pointers from Didone, though: keeping the outer edge of the right stem vertical to a greater height than the inner edge, "cheating" by shaving a bit off the serifed stem, and just generally tweaking the curves until they seemed to flow into each other better.

What do you think?  I do like it better now, but obviously I'd like to finalize this particular curve design before I propagate it through the whole font by hand.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, thanks for the comment and sorry for the late reply; I've been rather busy with Real Life.

You're right about the |t|, I'm thinking of extending the curved foot into a bit of a serif to the right, and raising the stem higher above the x-height.

Pity about the |g|, it's one of my favorite characters of the font. I agree about the ear, but what would you suggest for the bottom loop? I'd certainly prefer to keep it two-storey.

<b>EDIT:</b> How about this?  I shortened the connecting stem in the |g|, increased the ear a bit, and brought the lower bowl closer to a complete |o|-shape.  (I tried the latter; didn't work well.)  Also made the aforementioned changes to the |t|.

I've also had some fun with ligatures. Currently, only the <strong>f—</strong> ones are in LIGA, with all the others in DLIG. I'm not quite happy with that arrangement, though, since most casual users of the font might never actually get to see them. Therefore, I'm tempted to move most ligatures into LIGA. I'd keep just a few of the most unusual-looking ones in DLIG (such as the old-fashioned <strong>tz</strong>) so as not to alienate “regular” users.

Does that make sense?

When I critique somebody else's work it's important for me to try to not impose my own stylistic preferences; I can be most helpful when I help others better express their own style; and really, if I cause others to express <em>my</em> style I reduce the value of my own work! I have to be able to put myself in their shoes, which requires a certain "design empathy". With the right mindset I can help somebody improve a font that I personally can't stand! This "psychological leap" is a failing typical of most people who provide critiques, and probably the reason some people just don't like doing critiques (although sometimes it's because they're too vain to entertain the notion that others can actually help improve <em>their</em> work).

However one way a third-party can clearly help is to see imbalances, inconsistencies that the original designer is unable to see for various reasons (often due to being too close to the work).

So: If you like a peculiar "e" (the most common letter no less) you can't really mind a quote/apostrophe simply because it's peculiar.

		<div class="commentbody">So the quote is really that peculiar...?  Huh. I wouldn't have guessed.

Incidentally, I'm rather liking that new <strong>e</strong>. I checked with Didot and found I get the same lack of weight balance between <em>feeler</em> and <em>foolor</em> as I do with my new <strong>e</strong>, so it can't be that bad a flaw. 

Then again, if I were to go through the font and de-peculiarize all the peculiar letters, I'd get a rather different font.  Maybe that's how I could use my original idea of building a matched pair of “Glamor” and “Glory” fonts: The current version, with its dense vertical pillar structure, could be “Glory”, and I could make “Glamor” a more traditionally-shaped font with diagonals in <strong>k v w x y</strong> to go with it.

		<div class="commentbody">Alright, made some more tweaks and corrections. The main change is that Glory now has rectangular tittles and periods. The new PDF file is at the URL in the post above.

I could really use a quality check by a pro, so let's up the ante a bit. I'm offering a <strong>free licence</strong> for these two fonts as recompense for whoever gives the PDF above a careful inspection and reports the major flaws. (<strong>EDIT:</strong> That offer only stands until the first 1–2 reviews...)

I'm also interested in contracting out the kerning. I'll use iKern if it comes down to it, but I suspect these fonts need rather little kerning due to their vertical nature (especially Glory, which eschews diagonals), so it might be a quick-and-easy (-and-affordable) manual job for a skilled typophile.</div>

BTW fonts like this might not need a lot of kerning, but the tight and high-contrast nature is actually rather demanding in terms of "base spacing". Look for example at the "ump" in your most-recent image. You can't just use a [simple] formula for the sidebearings.
