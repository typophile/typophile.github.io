    I was only able to find one of the 6000 alternates provided in poetica that had
    this characteristic. When I resort to name calling, I must be <i> outta my league</i>.
    <BR> <BR>Grant, that is one way to shed the pounds. <BR> <BR>Randy <BR> <BR>For
    what it&#39;s worth, I did a crappy little rendering of what I thought it might
    look like &#40;using a mouse in photoshop!&#41; and ran it through what the font.
    It thought it was and inline san serif. Hey you can&#39;t add an image when editing!

    <BR>All the little intersections are slightly bracketed in this font. Nathan is
    it an italic garamond-of-some-veriety amperstand? &#40;that narrows it down to
    a few thousand&#41;
