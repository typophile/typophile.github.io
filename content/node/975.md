body: ' the lettering below was created for the visual identity project of an economy/administration
  insitute. the client, which wanted to have a mixed signature of his company &#40;symbol
  &#43; typography&#41;, liked the type so much that decided not to use the symbol.
  <BR> <BR>/image{ideagavea.gif} <BR> <BR>i liked the result a too, and am starting
  to think about drawing the whole alphabet, just as an exercise. <BR> <BR>here are
  some characters that i already sketched: <BR> <BR>/image{idea.gif} <BR> <BR>i want
  to create a version with less weight, a &#39;normal&#39; version of this &#39;bold&#39;
  font. can anyone sugest some literature on this matter - generating differente weights
  of the same typeface? it would be of great help... <BR> <BR>thanks in advance, sorry
  for the not-so-good english... <BR> <BR>gustavo. '

  body: ' Ohhh! I love it! <BR> <BR>As for generating different weights, you could
    try with the offset path in Illustrator if that&#39;s what you are using. You
    will have to adjust it manually afterwards though. '

  body: beautiful work! it reminds me somewhat of <A HREF="http://www.emigre.com/EFoIArb.html"
    TARGET="_blank"> Barry Deck&#39;s Arbitrary Sans</A> -- that is not to infer you
    took anything from his work, but it is very reminiscent. <BR> <BR>please post
    your continued efforts with this family, I would be very interested to see how
    you execute the lighter weight.
