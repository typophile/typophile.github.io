body: Hi, <BR>I&#39;m sorry for this basic question, but... <BR>what makes a 12pt
  font to be a 12pt font? Why a 12pt Helvetica is different from a 12pt Times? Is
  it due to the differences in the relationships among their respectives x-height/ascenders/descenders?
  <BR>How can I make a 8pt font &#40;for example, to be used as a bitmap for Flash&#41;?
  Does it mean that the overall height &#40;ascenders &#43; descenders&#41; should
  be 8pt? <BR>Thanks, <BR>Marcelo

  body: i have a similar question, is there a standard or any suggestions on measuring
    bitmap fonts? what should be the size of each square in fontographer, in order
    for the font to appear normal at 8, 10 or 12 pt? after a little research, i think
    that over at &#34;04&#34; they are using 125&#42;125 squares and their fonts are
    appearing at normal size at 8pt i think... doesnt always work for me though..

  body: As far as I know, 8 pixel fonts only show up as 8 <i>points</i> on a Macintosh
    monitor. On a PC monitor &#40;VGA&#41; they appear as 6 points, and on SVGA even
    smaller. To show up as 8 points, they need to be 11ppem for VGA and 13ppem for
    SVGA. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve not done much work with bitmap fonts, but if you want
    to make an 8 pixel font, your &#34;pixels&#34; should be 125upm square. 10 pixel
    fonts need 100upm &#34;pixles,&#34; etc.

    leads, history and the like, I wanted a more practical approach at the time of
    design, and that is what I get with your explanation. <BR>Thanks again. <BR>Regards,

  body: It seems that, along with x-height, the cap height still plays a pretty big
    role in the visual size of a face, too. With lead type, we used to call that how
    big a face was &#34;on the body.&#34; E.g., you could have 12 point type on a
    14 point body. But it still has some effect digitally.  <BR> <BR>Looking at Bembo
    and Berthold Baskerville &#40;not my favorite faces&#41;, Bembo&#39;s caps are
    622 upms and Baskerville&#39;s are 706 - which seems a pretty big difference to
    me - while their x-heights are <i>relatively</i> equal &#40;63% and 62% of the
    cap height, respectively&#41;.  <BR> <BR>It seems that this would have quite an
    effect on how large a face <i>looked</i> on the page. <BR> <BR>&#62;On the other
    hand, it does depend on the language...  <BR> <BR>This might be a bit off-topic,
    but one of the most interesting things I saw at TypeCon was Will Powers&#39; presentation
    on book faces. Of the examples he showed, one was a bilingual &#40;English and
    Dakota&#41; book of stories. The English pages were set 10.5|13 and the Dakota
    was 10.65|13. I didn&#39;t get a chance to ask, but I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s
    because Dakota uses fewer caps and extending letters, but has &#40;many&#41; more
    vowels. I never studied Dakota morphology specifically, but IIRC long- and short-vowels
    play a pretty big role in a lot of Native American languages.  <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    I just thought that was a really nice piece of type setting that did it&#39;s
    best to respect both languages, without creating a visually jarring spread.

    very interesting! Is Dakota a Native American language set using Latin? It might
    be more than the cap frequency that affects the relative size. Does Dakota use
    fewer extending lc letters? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Yes, Dakota has a Latin orthography - I&#39;m not sure how/when it came about.
    My presumption was, just from looking at the pages, that the size is due to both
    cap frequency &#40;much less than English&#41; and lack of extending lc. Here&#39;s
    a sentence from Powers&#39; book: <BR> <BR>Mii dash ga-pi-izhi-giiweyaan, omaa
    dash indaa-ani-wiiji&#39;izhinizhaawigoo owidi Mashkimodaang ezhinikaadeg, miinawaa
    go ji-gikinoo&#39;amaagooyaan. <BR> <BR>I might try to dig through some of my
    notes from Amy Dahlstrom this weekend. Most of her work was with Fox, but it might
    be interesting anyway.'
