  body: You have some interesting work there! I think that you work deserves a better
    laid out site than just stacking things all on one page, though :)

    if you start a thread for Slorca, that might be interesting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "A lot of very nice work. I like the 'lechem eretz', which retains its readability
    even with the elegant swashy design.\r\n\r\nThe 'Chinese' sign looks fake and
    awkward because the stuff in the center violates the rules of how Chinese characters
    have to be formed. \r\n\r\nYour effort at reversal of weight for Hebrew characters
    in Slorca doesn't work for me. But my Hebrew is poor and I am not used to reading
    it, so I am probably not a good judge. To me the Hebrew font 'Erica' does pull
    off such a reversal (but only a slight one) very well, if I remember rightly.
    If you were doing a cross of horizontal and vertical strokes in a Roman cap, you
    would if anything thin the horizontal near the intersection, as Albertus does.
    Here thickening the horizontal looks awkward to me. But as I say, I am not looking
    with eyes thoroughly accustomed to Hebrew, so I may be off in this comment.  \r\n "

  body: "Thank you all for your replies and comments,\r\n\r\n* I really should start
    a thread for Slorca. i'd be very interested to hear what people around here have
    to say about it. I think I need to find the time to give it a few more sessions,
    at least to have a full set of the alphabet, and then i'd post it. now the problem
    is finding the time for that...\r\n\r\n* about the chinese print - actually korean.\r\nit
    was actually a technical study of the screenprinting process - i didnt design
    this piece, i just scanned an old korean balm or something and traced it, every
    line, ornament and letter is the way it was on the original tag. maybe i should
    write it next to the print.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your comments, Feel free to
    contact me or post further replies"
