body: "I am pulling my hair out trying to help a user with a particularly recalcitrant
  problem. The user is running Windoze XP with SP3, and every time he tries to open
  or add a new Open Type font or Type 1 font, he gets the message \"<fontname>.otf
  is not a valid font file.\"\r\n\r\nWe've tried everything I can think of, from sfc
  /scannow to repairing the font folder and checking the atm*.dll files. We've checked
  that he's not using the switch to use more than 3gb ram (known to cause this problem),
  and he has a NVIDIA graphics card (not a ATI one, also known to cause this).\r\n\r\nAny
  other thoughts?"

    rename *.OTF to *.TTF.\r\nThen Comb your hair with Flowers"

  body: I'm intriqued by that advise Aziz. Fonts with an .otf extension are PostScript
    flavored OpenType fonts, while fonts with the .ttf extension are either TrueType
    or TrueType flavored OpenType fonts. Why would you rename *.otf to *.ttf?

  body: Even if that is a functional workaround, it's not a fix, and doesn't do anything
    for the Type 1 fonts.
