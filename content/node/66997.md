  I couldn't find any bigger versions of <a href=\"http://bookcoverarchive.com/book/history_lesson_for_girls\">this
  cover</a>. Maybe the one-storey \"a\", peculiar \"y\", and swash on the capital
  \"G\" (the descending \"F\" may very well be a customisation) rings a bell with
  someone who knows what this one is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/history_lesson_for_girls_4081.large.jpg]"

  body: "I am probably very-very off track here but tome it looks like someone took
    y and G from a Goudy Modern Italic and straightened them.\r\n\r\nBut I am probably
    totally wrong."

  body: It's a very interesting theory, but straightening an italic face is so destructive
    for the general architecture of the characters that it would show in the curves
    and so on.
