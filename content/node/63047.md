  on Post-Modern typography. I have recently read Cult of the Ugly which is brilliant
  but would love to find some more up-to-date writings.\r\n\r\nThank you very much
  Jake."

  body: "Any discussion on postmodernism that constrains itself to one genre, such
    as typography, is undeniably conservative and consequently could not have been
    postmodern to begin with.\r\n\r\nMy tentative suggestion is to take more general
    theories of postmodernism, throw them into a metaphorical blender along with the
    history of typographic rules, and take a close look at whatever spills out."

    and \"Fellow Readers,\" by Robin Kinross?\r\n\r\nThe first is available in the
    latest Emigre retrospective, <a href=\"http://emigre.com/EB.php?id=125\"><em>Emigre
    70</em></a>, or in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Texts-Type-Critical-Writings-Typography/dp/1581150822/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1257781435&sr=1-1\"><em>Texts

    is by definition, no longer post-modern\u2014you might want to check out Rick
    Poynor's \"No more Rules: Graphic Design and Post Modernism\". It is the most
    recent and comprehensive survey of how post-modernism and graphic design (Including
    typography) relate to each other."
