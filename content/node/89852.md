body: I just watched Un Chien Andalou again, and would love to be able to use the
  title card font in my writing. I know it's handwritten, but is anyone familiar with
  an existing similar font out there? Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/un_chien_andalou_titles_3784.jpg]

    alike.

    learn how to make fonts on Illustrator and make it myself in the future!
