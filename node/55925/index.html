  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello

I'm looking for a resource that shows Hotel logos/signage/promotion from the teens (as in 1910-1920). 

I have several good books on design history (including Steven Heller's "Graphic Style" and "Typology" -- both of them great btw -- as well as Philip Meggs' book) but there seems to be this gap between late Victorian/Arts&Crafts and early Modernism in the 1920s. 

Also, I'm looking for the commercial "vernacular" design of American hotels, not the avant garde of European art/design movements of the time, which I'm assuming were in a completely different place.
	
I'm guessing my resources are going to be limited, so I'm open to expanding the pool of sources to include restaurant graphics, matchbook covers, signage, advertising, etc. from the period.

Any ideas anyone has for books, online resources, etc., would be really appreciated.

Thanks,

-Rob

They won't be good books until they recognize the dominant role of Historicism in 20th century mass media, especially during the first three decades.

		<div class="commentbody">An interesting tangent you might follow in this pursuit would be to look at the big ATF specimen books from the early 20th century: 1906, 1912, 1923. Probably also the big BB&S book from that period. To illustrate how types might be used, advertisements for businesses were included on many pages. The businesses were for the most part made-up, just as today many design students create businesses on which to base their identity projects. I'm sure there were hotel ads.

So it gets a bit fanciful, since these were not likely to be real businesses. But it may give a view of what was considered to be the "way" hotel ads were to look. & you'd probably find better composition than in the Biltmore ad Nick shows us.

Have fun.

Nothing wrong with the composition.
I particularly like the way the block of small caps centres under the "BILTMORE" and the archway in the illustration.
But I guess you mean compositor composition, not layout composition.
In which case, I have to say--they even kerned the LT!

However, although they were able to close up between "w" and "Y", because it's just a thin space, they weren't able to kern between "Y" and "o", and didn't bother to put a thinner space between ALL and THEATRES--but then, that's extremely small type.
"New York" was a huge colour problem back in the days of metal.</div>
