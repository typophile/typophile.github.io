body: "Hi, all:\r\n\r\nHaving reached a good basic grasp of InDesign (or so I think),
  it's time for me to take my typographic skills to the next level: I want to learn
  better the finer details of kerning, tracking, and h&j--to know when to rely on
  a font's metrics and how best to tweak them throughout a text when not.\r\n\r\nI
  know the best way to learn is still by doing, and I plan to do as much as I can.
  But with a PhD in another field and a full-time day job, and freelance design on
  the side, it's got to be self-education for me. Courses and apprenticing are out
  of the question, and anything I can do to speed the process along within reason
  would be good.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the resources I've already amassed, thanks
  to past discussions on Typophile.\r\n\r\nBringhurst's <em>Elements</em> (and Richard
  Rutter's online interpretation for the web) \r\nDowding, <em>Finer points in the
  spacing and arrangement of type</em>\r\nFelici, <em>Complete manual of typography</em>\r\nHaslam's
  <em>Book design</em>\r\nHendel's <em>On book design</em>\r\nHochuli's <em>Designing
  books</em> and <em>Detail in typography</em>\r\nMitchell & Wightman's <em>Book typography</em>\r\nAri
  Rafaeli's <em>Book typography</em>\r\nWilliamson's <em>Methods of book design</em>\r\n\r\nI
  know these are good for discussions of general approaches to setting type in print.
  But I really need to know more about the mechanics of adjusting type in InDesign--specifically,
  using GREP and scripts. I've run across resources like Peter Kahrel's kerning script
  for InDesign, and his O'Reilly book on GREP, but I don't think I'm even at the level
  where I could use them properly, or accurately evaluate the relative advantages
  and drawbacks of GREP and scripts (or recognize when it would be better just to
  edit the kerning tables in a font directly, something I feel is well beyond my abilities
  right now). Any suggestions?"

    the old man in me, but most anything from the Hyphen Press is pretty good.\r\n\r\nFor
    the overlap between design and composition, see esp. <cite>Detail in Typography</cite>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/authors/jost_hochuli\r\n\r\nThough
    I'd note that some of the spacing in the lovely examples wouldn't survive in the
    text as set -- generally true for Dowding, too.\r\n\r\nJust one example: All that
    lovely space between the parens and letters in the examples is larger than a word
    space in a tight line. You wind up with the parens being closer to the previous
    word, even though separated by a space, that to the letter it encompasses.\r\n\r\nComposition
    is all about compromise. Still, the examples in Hochuli's book show some worth
    considering."

  body: "Hmm.\r\n\r\nI'd ditch Ari Rafaeli's <cite>Book typography</cite>, but my
    reasons may mixed with  personal ones. He quoted a portion of an email of mine
    to another person (not Rafaeli) without my permission. Not only was it a portion,
    but also dependent on a conversation which was not included. In other words, he
    distorted my thinking for an ulterior purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd that, it seems to me,
    was to elevate himself by running down Rich Hendel, who, I'll allow, is a friend.
    Aside from that, I find it simply a rehash of early to mid twentieth century British
    typography. Better to get that from the original sources.\r\n\r\nAs to that: I
    was enamored of Dowding at first, but when trying to actually set books with his
    tight spacing, kept running into problems. Part of this may be because I set mainly
    scholarly texts, which are not only peppered with long words, but have a relative
    dearth of short ones. Along with hyphenation, it is the number of word spaces
    in a line that control how tight or loose those spaces must be to justify a line
    -- at least, if you don't alter the type itself. The number of characters has
    no bearing. \r\n\r\nJust as an example, hyphenation too is worth considering.
    Some hyphen points are awkward, but will give more even spacing (or tighter spacing)
    in the text. So, do you go for clearer hyphenation, or more even spacing? Or take
    it as a compromise, with no clear rules. Would you let a single \"A\" of a title
    end a line (as in <cite>A Bridge too Far</cite>, or would you keep it with at
    least one more word of the title? How about \"vol. 21\"? Break between for more
    even word spacing, or keep them together? Etc. \r\n\r\nSo I'd take Dowding as
    a powerful apologist. <cite>Finer points</cite> is worth reading, but in the end,
    Dowding will sacrifice everything for tight word spacing. And that, I'd argue,
    is not an aesthetic amenable to reading, which is still the point of setting type.
    \r\n\r\nSame with Bringhurst, to a lesser extent. Well worth reading, not always
    worth following.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is the point: Many of these texts argue strongly
    for certain positions, and that can be quite useful if you take the arguments
    as polemics. But if you take these texts as giving rules to follow, things to
    emulate without question, you're not doing the work of a compositor.\r\n\r\nFor
    books, both interior design and composition are at their best when reading the
    text is served. Graphic design and typographic purity have to take the back seat.

    allow that I find <cite>Art of the Printed Book</cite> and <cite>An Atlas of Typeforms</cite>
    very good typography manuals. They don't tell you rules, they show you how things
    were done in times past. Descriptive, rather than prescriptive. We are always
    reinventing typography, ever so slightly.\r\n\r\nI like Nick's idea.\r\n\r\nI
    like too exploring some of the old verbotens. For example, think about slight
    modifications of letters as an aid to justification, or slight changes in tracking.
    With the old increments of 1/18 unit em, or even the 1/54 unit em, you wouldn't
    want to do this. Now we have 1/1000 unit em. And InDesign will allow a decimal
    percentage of that.\r\n\r\nEven rethink the whole notion. In scribal times before
    Gutenberg, don't you think they modified letters a bit, as they wrote (copied),
    to get the line to fit? Zapf did some work on alternate characters as an aid to
    justification and even word spacing. Implementing the idea was a problem for the
    layout programs, ultimately never addressed.\r\n\r\nDifferent tools and different
    audiences offer a chance to reexamine solutions. But they should be *solutions*,
    not just clever ideas."

  body: "William, it's hard to find Young's books--not surprisingly, libraries in
    the Illinois systems and Illiac are loath to lend their copies out. But I did
    track down <em>Logotypes and letterforms</em>. \r\n\r\nCharles, I agree: it seemed
    pretty clear to me early on that a lot of books on type are polemics (just look
    at Tschichold!), and that what we get out of most of these sorts of books is not
    answers but clear statements of principle, and forthright questions and ways of
    framing answers, values to be traded off against each other when making typographic
    judgments. That's certainly what I've gotten out of them so far. And since academic
    texts are the ones I'd be most likely to be setting, the tip about Dowding is
    well appreciated. I tend myself to favor close spacing (and I saw that Rafaeli
    got many of his ideas about that from Dowding), but you can see in Dowding's own
    book the downside of being dogmatic about it.\r\n\r\nI also think Nick's idea
    is intriguing. I have a copy of <em>Art of the printed book</em> on my shelf and
    a little bit of time on my hands over the holidays. And maybe after some quality
    time with Kahrel and Lynda.com I might have the skills to give it a constructive
    go. (But--call me the neophyte purist zealot--I don't think I could make myself
    modify letters.) "

    Hartley & Marks edition. \r\n\r\nSpend the money to get Godine's edition of the
    <cite>Art of the Printed Book</cite>. My copy is not to hand, but there is a sample
    of 19th century French Typography toward the end of the book where word spacing
    is quite large. So to is the leading, and the margins. It all fits. No spatial
    relationship in a book should be considered by itself.\r\n\r\nHere is an irreverent
    thought I once had: Why is the bottom margin traditionally so large? Now, folio-sized
    books had to be read at a table or desk. You don't want the first line on the
    page to be too far away. What about the last line? Suppose you have a significant
    belly?\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAs to modifying letters. Set a few lines of type, ragged
    right. Print out the page. Now \"condense\" it 1/1000 of an em. Print that out.
    Put the two pages away, and look at them, independently, the next day. Not together,
    but sequentially. Can you tell them apart?\r\n\r\nSet justified copy. Find a paragraph
    where the wordspacing is just going a bit loose. Make the screen display smallish
    -- normal InDesign screen display with spreads is about right. One thing you'll
    see about that paragraph is it appears a bit lighter than the others. Now, track
    it a bit -- usually no more than -4 or -5, condense it to 99 percent, so as to
    save a line. All of a sudden, its color changes, closer to the other paragraphs.\r\n\r\nWhich
    setting is worse?\r\n\r\nYou can do the same thing with carding, which Richard
    Eckersley was so fond of. No, you can't see a .1 point difference in leading.
    But the color of the plus-carded page will be lighter. Which is more important,
    completely regular page bottoms, or the color of the page?\r\n\r\nEtc."

    the line, typically characters with prominent horizontal strokes. This is a holdover
