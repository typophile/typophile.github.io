    is a really great version of Futura H&FJ did for HP that is floating all over
    the net. It is supposedly free and licensed under the GPL (I say supposedly because
    neither HP or H&FJ seem to be distributing it, but they don\u2019t seem to be
    sending takedown noticed, either)."

  body: "Thanks all. \r\nAtleast for the time being i will go with Futura ND version
    as it seems to be good and it can be bought individually and not as a package
    which fits my immediate need. I would like to use Bembo (I love bembo) as my body
    text font for official use. But does Futura and Bembo go well with each other?
    Any suggestions. Thanks once again."

    at the Neufville Futura installed on my computer (above) and this Luz Sans (below)
    that I learned about in this thread.\r\n\r\nI think Luz Sans is better balanced
    in just about every way. (Although, the \"@\" symbol has been optimized for capital
    letters, which means plenty of baseline shifting with email addresses.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    H&FJ can comment on the process, design goals, peculiarities, etc.\r\n\r\nMike

    before buying a licenced type, Casady & Greene's SansSerif might be all that's
    needed. The Fluent Laser Fonts are currently on the typOasis.

    disputed. I discussed this with a bunch of Ubuntu people <a href=\"https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/115258\">here</a>,
    and according to HF&J the files were never released under GPL conditions, but
    exclusively to HP (maybe HF&J is planning to sell them publicly later? Wouldn't
    be the first time.)\r\n\r\nPaul asked Bdale Garbee at HP about the status of the
    font, but we haven't received an answer yet. At any rate, unless HP has full rights
    to the fonts and decides to release them, the files are in a very, very dark-gray
    zone, legally speaking."
