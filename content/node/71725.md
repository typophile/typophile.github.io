  body: "Well, this one was an old one (2004); another I'd forgotten about. I keep
    digging the old files and something(s) pop up.\r\n\r\nAll I really had to do was
    to turn it into OT, and to be careful not to use any FontLab hinting.\r\n\r\nAt
    first I thought about that that middle intersection of the 's' is not right, but
    then decided not to touch it. Something for others to ponder."
