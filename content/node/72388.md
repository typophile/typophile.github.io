  but they all have the open \"E\" in capital style but this font has a classic cursive
  script \"e\".\r\n\r\nAll suggestions welcome."

    they look slightly different to me. Do you have other samples of this?\r\n\r\n-

    both from Harold's Fonts. I admit these are not especially close, but the feel
    is similar to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: This is based on the Italian school script style. I agree with Mike that it
    is lettering/writing, not a font. The closest approximation I am aware of is <a

  body: "That's closer than the ones I mentioned Florian. If you fattened the stroke
    on that it would be pretty similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
