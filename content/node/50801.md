  body: Squint really hard. But all joking aside, like Sii notes, keep them small,
    or crop them in interesting ways, or even apply filters wisely to make them look
    different on purpose - basically turn them into something very different then
    what was originally given to you.

    types mixed with some distressed ornaments and frames could work in a thrift-shop-hipster

    Those can make bland/poor photos interesting. Going black and white also can make
    a bad photo look a lot better."

    But I think it all depends on what kind of magazine we are talking about. While
    it could work well for an artsy or design magazine, I guess if you try to sell
    jewellery you're out of luck :)

    go with the blur. Learn to love the fuzziness. Maybe you need to lwt your design

    In general, one reason media hire designers to create illusions. The best photographers
    you can afford take the best photos the can and then they colour correct and crop
    their hearts out, then designers colour correct and crop their hearts out, and
    used all their skill and experience to pick just the right type and arrange it
    all nicely on a page and it's all a very nice, very slick and manufactured illusion.
    So, here you are with this project... except the illusion you have to create is

  body: "There are a number of techniques you can work with. By amateur I assume you
    mean that these shots are low resolution/poor lens choice/bad exposure/poor focus/bad
    composition/&c.; try this. First, see if you can improve the image by applying
    a 'fix lens distortion' filter. Then skew the image if additional perspective
    correction is necessary; this possibly after rotating the image if it's crooked.
    There are a number of effects you can produce at this point, such as [Photoshop
    specific] change to bitmap mode and generate lithograph patterns; multiply a duplicate
    layer and mask based on the most flattering color channel; change color mode to
    grayscale and then to monotone/duotone might get you something interesting to
    look at. Or do something collage-like. I like the suggestions here that move you
    in a typographic direction, because let's not forget we are type folks here.\r\nI

  body: "I usually agree with a lot of James' opinions, but i have to take exception
    with a couple of his points on this topic.\r\n\r\n<em>No photographer has any
    kind \u201Cright\u201D not to have their shots monkeyed with. </em>\r\n\r\nIt's
    often easy for designers to forget that the other creatives they're working with
    are also artists. I believe there <em>is </em>an inherent \"right\" to expect
    your work to be treated respectfully. For instance, I would never think of hiring
    an illustrator to create a piece for a publication and then dump it into Photoshop
    and change the colors of the work to suit my own needs. If these sorts of changes
    need to be made, I would -- in <em>every</em> case -- consult the artist at the
    least, and either give them the opportunity to make the changes themselves or
    sign off on any changes I made to the work. If that agreement couldn't be secured,
    I would pay the artist the 'kill' fee and move to someone else. Of course this
    is a different situation when dealing with stock images (where the artist signs
    away all creative rights), but when dealing one-on-one with another creative,
    I believe there are creative rights involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>There isn\u2019t
    much they can do about it, and at the end of the day most of them wize up and
    accept it as normal and par for the course. People who can\u2019t accept their
    images being manipulated or cropped in some way are unrealistic and unprofessional.</em>\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I disagree. There is nothing unprofessional about expecting the designer to preserve
    the artistic integrity of commissioned work. If I treated the illustrators, photographers
    and other creative professionals I work with with that attitude, I would find
    my stable of professionals empty pretty quickly. And I wouldn't blame them a bit
    for refusing to work within that atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving said that,
    crops and scalings fall pretty much in the realm of 'design considerations,' and
    should, in most cases, be professionally acceptable to most commissioned artists.\r\nThis
    gets a little away from your topic of working with unprofessional snapshot work,
    but I had to voice my difference to the concept of whatever-the-designer-wants
    approach."

    The supplied portraits had been the worst mix of mostly unusable stuff I have
    ever seen. I had to come up with some unifying way of treating the pictures -
    the result can be seen at http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/2926848979_2013f480d9_b.jpg.
    I can agree with what was said above - duotone, cropping, tedious cleaning in
    Photoshop (would not be probably that necessary in a magazine) placement on the
    spread etc., all that served its purpose. But it was hell of a work.
