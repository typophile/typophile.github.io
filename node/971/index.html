  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">indesign users: y'all remember how easy it was to make global changes to kern pairs in qxp &ndash; i've spoken w adobe reps &amp; they assure me that indesign will NOT have this feature in any future revs. this means that altering kern pairs has to be done at the font level, thus: <BR>1. leave indesign app <BR>2. turn off font in suitcase or other font manager <BR>3. open font in font editor <BR>4. make change(s) to font's kern pairs <BR>5. turn font back on in font manager <BR>6. return to indesign &amp; get back to work. <BR> <BR>am i missing something? can anyone offer a better method? this seems way too time-consuming and troublesome. <BR>HELP! <BR> <BR>thanks much, folks.</div>
