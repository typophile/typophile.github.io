body: "Hello, can anybody help with identifying the 'font' used in this logo? I'm
  redrawing it for a client as part of a refresh/rebrand but I'd like to figure out
  what the starting point is.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be pretty Garamond-esque but there
  are a couple of things throwing it out... Most notably the 'K' and perhaps the 'R'.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help you can give me :)\r\n\r\nView it here - http://yfrog.com/f/h29st2j/"

    The ampersand is similar to the one in <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-sULb9v\">Caslon
