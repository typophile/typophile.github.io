  body: this design decision is related to some of your other design decisions, e.g.,
    what&#39;s the length of your line of type, or measure? if a column&#39;s narrow,
    left alignment with a ragged right will likely be better. what&#39;s the brochure
    about? justified text is sometimes thought of as more &#34;conservative,&#34;
    as a generalization. hope this helps, good luck.
