body: I'm checking the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/languagetags.htm">OpenType
  Layout tag registry</a> and it seems there is just one tag, ESP, that covers both
  forms of Spanish (Castilian and Latin American). Does this makes sense? Should there
  be two separate tags? I kind of assumed that there would be... Then again, my knowledge
  of Spanish isn't quite that intimate. Can i get an informed opinion here?

    the digraph \u201Cl\xB7l\u201D. Espa\xF1ol (ESP), as far as I\u2019m aware, covers
    everything worldwide. i.e. the written language is pretty much the same everywhere
    but the spoken language breaks up into various dialects."

    Spanish\"</a> was much more interesting. There it states that, \"Nowadays, successful
    feature films may be dubbed into Spanish in up to three different \"standard\"
    versions: Iberian (or European) Spanish for Spain (Castilian Spanish); Rio-de-la-Plata
    Spanish for Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina, Mexican Spanish for Mexico; and another
    one for the rest of Latin America.\"\r\nI would think that the OT spec would recognize
    the divergence of the Spanish languages to a greater degree than it does."

    body: "The differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between different regions
      for Castilian (i.e., \"Spanish\") are substantial, but this doesn't affect typography.
      \"Voces\" might be pronounced \"vothesh\", \"vos's\", or \"vose\", but it's
      spelled the same everywhere, and any rules concerning syllable division, accent
      marking, digraphs, capitalization, etc. are also the same everywhere. So far
      as I know, all the countries concerned follow the orthographic standards set
      by the Real Academia Espa\xF1ola, so even when the RAE changes something that
      might affect OT behavior - like the changed alphabetization rule of 1994 - it
      is adopted everywhere. Of course, this could always change in the future, at
      which time a new tag might be needed."

  body: I guess that you could equally ask whether there should be different English
    tags, because English letters, especially vowels, can sound radically different
    in different dialect regions.

  body: "\"There are actually very few ortographic or typographic differences between

    translation of a brochure into Spanish. There were 2 Spanish speaking individuals
    as part of the clients team. They were from different countries though and kept
    getting into arguments about the translation. It was sort of like a Mac vs PC
    flame-war thing. They each wanted the translation to be done by different people
    because of the kind of Spanish. This was to be a printed document so no phonetics
    were involved. They were both pretty passionate about differences. I never got
    the grasp of what the problem was, most of their arguing was done in Spanish.
    Eventually, the project was dropped.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: There are a lot of vocabulary differences. Like for example a vulture is a
    "buitre" in Spain but a "zopilote" in Mexico, and I think it's something else
    different in Peru. This applies especially to words for new technology - Mexico
    often either borrows from English or models its word on English, while Spain often
    creates a word modeled on French or Italian, so a computer is a "calculadora"
    in Spain but a "computadora" in Mexico.

  body: "Well, if Puerto Rican Spanish is like Cuban Spanish (La Tremenda Corte -
    \xA1Venga la sentencia! / \xBFQu\xE9 tu te crees?) I'm sure they had an argument...
    it's just that Spanish is very vesatile, we have many ways and words to say a
    single thing, in English you have a single word to say many things instead.\r\n\r\nBut
    I would agree that the most extreme variant of spanish is that one from Argentinians
    with things like \"decime, andate or ven\xED\" and \"vos\". Lunfardo, Chilango
    and other ways of speaking which I may ignore are more twisted yet but they are
    more like argots.\r\n\r\nI have a friend whose father is from Nicaragua and every
    time I call him to his house and his father answers I have to bite my cheek to
    avoid laughing because It's hard to understand what says... he talks so fast and
    eats so many letters.\r\n\r\nSome words are common in one place and insults in
    others like cajeta which is a burnt milk candy in Mexico and a vulgarity in South
    Am\xE9rica.\r\n\r\nHowever when written, Spanish breaks all this kind of boundaries,
    it may have been an issue of coloquial language or regional terminology Chris.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor...
