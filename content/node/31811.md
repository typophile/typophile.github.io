  some time now. I'm hoping you can help this newbie!\r\n\r\nI am looking for an opentype
  font which is  similar to Scala Sans. It must have bold versions, small caps, and
  old style figures. I realize that Scala has an opentype version, but the cost is
  prohibitive!\r\n\r\nI am using this for a publication that uses Scala, but in the
  next issue, I have to set many, many uncommon fractions.\r\n\r\nI'm looking at\r\n<a
