  ideas? Doesn't have to match exactly, just need the general feel...

    is it, or if this is just customised.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "FYI --\r\nCooper Black was available with swash and alternates on font filmstrips
    by Compugraphic for the old EditWriter typesetter.\r\n\r\nIt's listed (along with
    Cooper Black Italic with swash) in the contents of \"Swash, Alternate and Antique
    Type\" brochure (printed 1979 -- a couple of years before I got there) but for
    some reason I must have cut that page out years ago from my one and only copy!!!"
