  Books 2005. Does anyone know it's origin or what font this is based on (I'm assuming
  it's a custom font...googleing Flamingo Alphabet yielded some results but all of
  them feature..aehm..real flamingos ;)\r\n\r\nMany Thanks in advance\r\n\r\nSunny
  wishes from London\r\n\r\nx\r\n\r\nLars   \r\n\r\n"
