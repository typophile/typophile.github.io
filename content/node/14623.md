  body: In ye olden days BDTP (before desktop publishing), typesetters could insert
    spaces of various sizes (thin, normal, en, em) wherever they wished. You could
    insert a regular space on either side of the underscore, then adjust the horizontal
    scale of those spaces to match your requirements. Once you are satisfied with
    the results, you could copy and paste the space+underscore combos (beginning and
    ending) wherever you wanted.

    body: "Ok guys. Now i figured out that I can just insert a space or an em space.
      That works fine. only thing is that i have a lot of text and it isnt really
      the most efficient way to manually insert spaces, especially if i need to change
      the width of my textbox. So i really need to use character / paragraph styles,
      but i just cant figure out how to include a space into a character style. Any
      help????\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nCo"

  body: I don't think there's any way to cap a style with spaces in-line like that.
    Just a lot of find and replace, I guess.

  body: "Uh, I'm pretty tired so I'm not sure I understand what your goal is, but
    you can probably do this with a series of search-and-replaces.\r\n\r\nStep 1:\r\nfind:
    [space]\r\nreplace with: [hair space][thin space][hair space]\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\nfind:
    [thin space]\r\nreplace with [character style: notUnderlined]\r\n\r\nYou then
    have the underline extending past the word the width of a hair space, a break,
    & new underline that extends a bit before the word. If you want the break to be
    bigger, you can replace the thin space w/ a regular space, then muck with the
    word-spacing parameters.\r\n\r\nObviously, you want to do this after all editing
    is done.  :0)\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: 'elastik, I don''t know if that works with your text flow, or if it''s even
    more complicated than the suggestions made before, but you might as well try using
    table cells and take the bottom cell border as your (under-)line (with the stroke
    weight of your choice applied). One cell with a variable width sits in the middle
    (for your text) and two cells with fixed widths to its right and left. All the
    other cell borders (above and vertical) are then set to "none"/no stroke. '
