		<div class="commentbody">Hmm...Well, first glance first and last logos are sort of web 2.0, the third one seems similar to a real estate logo. (roof image I guess) Personal preference would have to be the 4th one. It can stand very strong even without the gray box and seems the best fit for a "high-end retailer". Although the "e" seems a little squished in there because of the high ascenders all around it. So my second choice would be the one below it.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your comments, i`m thinking of the modern adelto logo shouts out modern, cutting edge and the more typical logos professional and luxury. i ideally need to bridge this gap and get a luxury modern logo. my brand designer has come up with some more suggestions.

http://southcreative.com.au/clients/adelto/concepts/04.jpg

the company will be offering a range of high-end products, falper baths, bespoke kitchens etc. as well as certain building services. we will have an office in the UK and also Hong Kong.

I need something that speaks to both markets and has universal appeal, i have also been thinking up suitable taglines to allow clients to gain an insight into the brand ust from the logo. i thought of contemporary living. old fashioned ethics (but old fashioned is probably not a word i should use, i basically meant, personal, approachable)

can anyone think of a tagline? Probably have the logo all in black, and if anyone knows of a font that is both modern and high-end please let me know.

Thanks

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">When doing a logo.. here is the general process I have learned.

#1 Know your audience. You want to appeal to a UK and a Hong Kong Market. Hong Kong marketing is a much different ball game than the rest of the world. You're going to be competing alongside of a great deal of other companies that use bright colors to draw attention to themselves.

#2 Brainstorm. Think of ideas related to your company, the products they will be selling and interesting ways to incorporate the idea into the typeface you select.

#3 Research type options. You should be looking at examples of high-end design if you want to be high end yourself. In my experience, there's a lot of high-end logos that are usually just a type treatment, sometimes figuring out a new way to treat an old type face. (Making it look gold leafed for example, is the chintziest way to do it).

Looking at the Falper logo, I can see where your ideas are coming from. Also, all the person doing who is giving you ideas from branding, is simply selecting modern fonts.. like Optima and Rotis and tracking them out. I think there's a more innovative solution...

Here are some examples I thought might help. 

http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=717 - logos
http://www.phase-two.co.uk/logos_frank_hudson.html - nice bespoke kitchen maker's logo
http://www.habitathc.com/assets/images/New_Logo__3_.gif - high end modern furniture design, although this logo is pretty mediocre, it's still nice.
http://www.uwm.edu/Libraries/special/currentevents/recentacq/recentacqimages/Wright2.jpg - the font for wright, although it screams 1920s or 30s deco, I think, is a good example of modern/classic treatment. clean, simple, refined.

I hope this helped..

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">So I took a look at the new logos. Much different! Seems like you're headed in a different direction. The first ones that drew my eye would be the first and second one, even though I'm not so sure I'm liking that blue.

The all caps logos remind me of pixar, or maybe something a little more technology based, not high end furniture. It also seems to make it faceless (just in comparison...I think that's why I really like the lower caps, the letters seem to give the word a personality, good form. Just my opinion. I took a look at the website. Is that the final design? Are you trying to make the logo fit that style or are you going to adjust the web page to the finalized logo?

I would also have to agree with you that "old fashioned" probably isn't a good tag. I read it and instantly thought of the magazine "Country Living". :)

I mean, I'm terrible at thinking up tags, but maybe something more like "cozy" or something? Again, I'm bad at thinking up those things, but I gave it a try.

The font, to me, looks perfect. I mean if someone else can think of a better one then great. It seems very modern but has that swoosh to the ends that give it that softer feel and doesn't compromise the "high end" potential.</div>

At least that's what I first thought when I took a look at it. Good font though, I just think the "Adel" shape is too close to the "Adob" shape with that font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh no that website was of an old company, i`m just putting it on everywhere i go to get backlinks on it so google ranks me higher, clever!!

i`m still leaning towards the first logo, i know people on here think i should stick with the logo that says luxury, but i`ve had a fair bit of feedback and nearly all say that the top logo is more moder and contemporary, plus with an audiance of mainly 24 - 40 year olds a modern appearance is what i think the company needs. Plus no one else uses it, so it`ll stand out more.

Tagline...still think just contemporary living, but it does not really say we also offer building services, if i could get that in that would be good. 

i`m down to three logos in my little old head now, 1, 3 and 6 (all in black) maybe think of a symbol to add into it, but i do not want it too busy, so i might not bother!!

thanks again for your great comments, keep them coming, they are all appreciated,

http://southcreative.com.au/clients/adelto/concepts/04.jpg

the underlying principle of the adelto logo is that it has to be modern and contemporary, therfore the FF Cocon logo was chosen and enhanced to have this effect, i could simply go along the lines of all caps, some old, but this is fresher, still needs some slight modifications, but sometimes people change is good!!!

I`ll put the final logo on this post, so if anyone wants to check it and give me there final opinions it would be appreciated, should be done thurs/fri.

		<div class="commentbody">Very first thing that caught my attention was the black and white one. Where the ^ comes down and meets the letters, it has an overhang. The issue I see is that the overhang is far too small. You end up with a tiny bit of black still showing. Almost as if you meant to have it be flush, but didn't quite end up right. Looks like it needs to either be flush, or hang out more, so when someone sees it, they see it and move on and they don't stare and wonder why there is a speck of black showing.</div>
