body: "So I just started this a few weeks ago and wanted to see what the professionals
  of Typophile had to say about it. right now I just have a thin version, but I want
  it to potentially have around 5 weights and a condensed (the condensed I have on
  the example is not refined by any means). Also, I have not started adjusting kerning
  yet just because I want to finish the design of it, then go back and work out the
  metrics and spacings. \r\n\r\nAny critique or commentary is greatly appreciated.
  Thanks in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jurgen_image_5827.jpg]"

  body: Looks nice as a display typeface!  Reminds me of some of the quirkier sans
    serifs like Klavika and Karbid.
