  body: "It could be two different versions of Kabel. The bold lettering looks like
    ITC Kabel, but the lower case isn't right, because of the 'a'. The 'a' in Adobe's
    Kabel looks closer. There are several other Kabel versions, including Kaapeli
    from Tomi Haaparanta, but in most of them the boldest weights have flattened vertices
    on the N, or the l.c. 'a' isn't right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Jan, the heavy weight of Kabel has the wrong N and P, but ITC Kabel matches.
    I am just taking about the bold caps. I agree with you for the lower case.\r\n\r\n-
