  fonts i fished up from the design flood.</strong>\r\n\r\nTypography is literally
  alpha and omega when designing and most designers are constantly looking for new
  fresh fonts, either as inspiration or for a specific project.\r\n\r\nTherefore i
  have gathered together a gang of stylish way to reproduce letters and other characters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hft261_lace_panel_3418.jpg]\r\nLace
  (HelloHikimori Exclusive). HelloHikimori are an award winning studio from Paris,
  France.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chunk-12_5819.jpg]\r\nChunk is
  an ultra-bold slab serif typeface that is reminiscent of old American Western woodcuts,
  broadsides, and newspaper headlines.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Squab_6114.jpg]\r\nEven
  the legendary \u201Cquick brown fox\u201D looks lovely in Squab.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hft259_neodeco_panel_6230.jpg]\r\nRecommended
  for litho and high quality digital print.\r\n\r\nI have included a font from the
  site [[http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com|The League of Movepagetext Able Type]]
  is an initiative of the free, open source fonts well worth to check out!"
