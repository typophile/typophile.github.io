    rule for anything typographic is \"trust the eye\". No better way to know what
    to do than trying multiple solutions, at least when you're starting.\r\n\r\nThere
    are no 'rules' about this than your own judgement, so work hard on it. Getting
    good on combining typefaces is all about knowing a lot of them and being able
    to imagine them together.\r\n\r\nHope this helped.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    tend to look for something with a similar skeleton structure: the degree of openness
    in forms like a, e, c and similar letters, how the n, h, m, curve hits the left
    stem and the proportions of letterforms.\r\nLooking for fonts that would fit a
    specific project, I often find both sans and serifs that I consider have a similar
    \u201Ctone\u201D."

    design pundits use it to fill out their books about type. But it\u2019s just not
    a big deal. If you want to use the typefaces together, do it. If you don\u2019t,
    don\u2019t. Nobody is going to boycott your product because you used two sans
    types in the same ad, or because the x-heights weren\u2019t close enough, etc.
    Just relax and have fun."

  body: "Right \u2013 who needs craft, knowledge or quality.  :-(\r\n\r\nSeriously,
    I think successful combination of fonts is an important ingredient to making design
    compositions truly click \u2013 making them organized wholes instead of simple
    additions of elements. \r\nThere are rules, like matching construction principles
    or proportions, and they're good for starters, to avoid blatant clashes; but it's
    when you transcend them that things become truly interesting, IMO. A very important
    thing (and this is where I agree with James) is to play, and observe the new balance/harmony
    (or lack thereof) carefully. \r\n\r\nBringhurst sure is a good place to start.
    There have also been oodles of threads on specific pairings here on Typophile,
    so digging through the archives and learning from those examples might be interesting
    too."

    similarity (such as Utopia and Univers) or contrast (Futura/Bodoni)."

    fonts is not a science but something you grow into. It is instinctual. \r\n\r\nIn
    the beginning looking for similar skeletons is very helpful/useful. But then you
    need to also find pairs that contrast with one another and work for those reasons."

    when trying to pair. I like to make sure each attribute (colour, contrast, skeleton,
    angle, etc.) is either as similar as possible or as different as possible. Fonts
    with attributes that are close but not quite the same tend not to pair well.\r\n\r\nAnd
    of course, if it looks good, then ignore the rules.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Lex, that's a great parallel! Another way that lends itself well to thinking
    about type is thinking musically. When composing a duet, the two instruments or
    voices should be harmonious. One can be dominant, the other submissive; or both
    can be supportive, each with its unique contribution. As James Puckett says, and
    I agree with it, have fun. Don't become too dogmatic, and surprise yourself with
    the combinations that you make work. You will find that you can control to a great
    degree the context in which these combinations are seen.

  body: "I think it is hard finding a nice fit for such a display type, as the characteristics
    are very different from a text font, but then again: 1st one could work IMO, because
    they have simular x-height, although it wouldn't neccesarily make a pretty picture.
    The 2nd has an x-height that is too different to work well together. 3rd is a
    monospaced font, which makes this a difficult one as well. They do share some
    characteristics, in that they are both pretty crude in shape and the characters
    have a roundedness to them. But then again if one is used as only a bold headline
    and the other only for 11pt bodycopy it doesn't have to be a problem.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a bit of a sucker for finding perfect matches, but it's by no means an exact science,
    and fonts could work together in various ways. So there isn't one thing to look
    at. You could look for historical matches, but also for purely visual pairings.
    You can go for contrast or simularity. And it all very much depends on the context
    and the way you want to use them together. If you want to mix two typefaces in
    a running text the pairing is much more critical than if you only want to use
    the one for headlines and the other for copy. And in areas like bookcover design
    you just have to trust the eye.\r\n\r\nImportant thing is to have fun!\r\n\r\ngreetings
