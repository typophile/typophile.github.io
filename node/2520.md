body: I am in need of an University of Oregon &#40;Ducks&#41; font.  I am having trouble
  finding it online, I was hoping one of you could help me.  I see it&#39;s been asked
  before on here but i didn&#39;t see an answer.  Thanks either way.   <BR> <BR><a

  body: '&#34;Oregon&#34; was set in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/handel-gothic/handel-gothic/testdrive.html?s=OREGON&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Handel Gothic</a> and customized&#42;. <BR>I really don&#39;t
    know what the big &#39;O&#39; should be: it&#39;s very  <BR>difficult to ID a
    font just by one character that carries so  <BR>little specific traits. <BR> <BR>&#42;stretched
    horizontally, converted the upper left curve  <BR>on the &#34;E&#34; to a corner,
    flipped the &#34;U&#34; for the &#34;N&#34; and  <BR>also converted the upper
    left curve to a corner. Not too  <BR>difficult to recreate.'

  body: Thank ya troubleman.  Now if I could trouble you with one more question, what
    would be the best typeface editing program for a rookie to use to make said changes.  You
    could look at my username like that I suppose, but I think of it like someone
    pointing and saying, &#34;Now that&#39;s a nice friggin zombie.&#34;

    <BR>If you only need the logo, convert the type to outlines  <BR>in Adobe Illustrator,
    Macromedia Freehand or CorelDraw. <BR>No need to make a custom typeface for that.
