  body: Why are you posting this to a typography discussion forum? <BR> <BR>It is,
    by the way, a myth that Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. It
    is often cited, but most people are simply repeating what they have heard without
    questioning either the source or the method arriving at the conclusion. The idea
    was first put forward by Harvard University scholar Samuel Huntington, who is
    also responsible for the whole &#39;clash of civilisations&#39; idea back in 1993.
    For a contrasting study you might read Philip Jenkins&#39;s <i>The Next Christendom</i>.
    There are no reliable numbers for the spread of religion in the places that matter
    most in terms of population growth -- Africa and South America --, but it is pretty
    clear that in both these continents Christianity is spreading faster than Islam.
    The number of Christians in Africa outstripped the number of Moslems some time
    in the 1960s, and the number has more than doubled since 1970.

  body: 'From what I&#39;ve heard from different friends of mine who have converted
    to Islam, there are a few main reasons for most conversions. <BR> <BR>1. Islam
    is a religious lifestyle, not just a quick Sunday morning church visit and a label.
    Although some Christians do pray before each meal and spend much time with their
    Bible, etc.many don&#39;t in the USA. Islam is something that can&#39;t be shunted
    into a few spare hours. You pray five times a day. Your dress code is affected;
    even your food choices are explained in the Qur&#39;an. Many converts like it
    because they feel actively involved and as if they are truly religious. <BR> <BR>2.
    For women, it is a big and welcome change from the &#34;in your face&#34; sexuality
    of western culture. Women are not required by the Qur&#39;an to veil. They are
    required to dress modestly and it is &#42;recommended&#42; that they cover their
    hair. However, most do veil and some go farther with niquab &#40;the face screen&#41;
    or other traditional clothes. Women dressed like this consider themselves marked
    as religious women, not easy dates. They don&#39;t get hit on. No one gawks at
    their bodies. They are clearly off limits sexually and many that I personally
    know say it is liberating not to have to conform to western standards of sexy
    dress, makeup and spending so much time and money on appearance. You buy a five-dollar
    hijab, put your hair in a ponytail and cover, wear long skirt and a tunic shirt
    -you&#39;re set. <BR> <BR>3. Islam is also growing because many people are not
    satisfied with Christianity. They feel it is too liberal, too fluid and changes
    for the culture. Islam on the other hand is more rigid and does not as a whole
    allow much for modern changes and the whims of society. Many like it because they
    feel other religions have loose standards. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what I got from
    the new Muslimah&#39;s group at Yahoo, Islamway women&#39;s board and a few other
    friends of mine. Stats taken by many college groups say that women convert 4 times
    more often then men. <BR> <BR> <BR>This is an example:  <BR> <BR> <BR>Why Are
    Women Turning to Islam  <BR>At a time when Islam is faced with hostile media coverage
    particularly where the status of women in Islam is concerned, it may be quite
    surprising to learn that Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, and
    even more ironic to discover that the majority of converts to Islam are WOMEN.  <BR>The
    status of women is society is neither a new issue nor is it a fully settled one,
    and where Islam is mentioned, for many the term &#39;Muslim Women&#39; prompts
    images of exhausted mothers chained to the stove, &#39;victims&#39; suppressed
    in a life of indoctrination, frantic to be westernized and so on. Others will
    go to great lengths to explain how the hijaab is an obstacle, clouding the mind,
    and comment that female converts are either brainwashed, stupid or traitors to
    their sex. I reject such accusations and pose to them the following question:
    why is it that so many women who have been born and brought in the so called &#39;civilized&#39;
    societies of Europe and America are willing to reject their &#39;liberty&#39;
    and &#39;independence&#39; to embrace a religion that supposedly oppresses them
    and is widely assumed to be prejudicial to them?  <BR>As a Christian convert to
    Islam, I can only present my personal experience and reasons for rejecting the
    &#39;freedom&#39; that women claim to have in this society in favor of the only
    Religion that truly liberates women by giving us a status and position, which
    is completely unique when compared with that of non-Muslim counterparts. Before
    coming to Islam, I had strong feminist tendencies and recognized that where the
    women was concerned, a lot of shuffling around had been going on, yet without
    being able to pin her on the social map. The problem was ongoing: new &#39;women&#39;s
    issues&#39; being raised without the previous ones being satisfactorily resolved.
    Like the many women who shared my background, I would accuse Islam of being a
    sexist religion, discriminating, oppressing and giving men the greater privileges.
    All this coming from a person who did not even know Islam, one who had been blinded
    due to ignorance and had accepted this deliberately distorted definition of Islam.  <BR>   <BR>However,
    despite my criticisms of Islam, inwardly I wasn&#39;t satisfied with my own status
    as a woman in this society. It seemed to me that society would define such terms
    as &#39;liberty&#39; and &#39;freedom&#39; and then these definitions were accepted
    by women without us even attempting to question or challenge them. There was clearly
    a great contradiction between what women were told in theory and what actually
    happens in practice.  The more I pondered, the greater emptiness I felt within.
    I was slowly beginning to reach a stage where my dissatisfaction with my status
    as a women in this society, was really a reflection of my greater dissatisfaction
    with society itself. Everything seemed to be degenerating backwards, despite the
    claims that the 2000 was going to be the decade of success and prosperity. Something
    vital seemed to be missing from my life and nothing would fill this vacuum. Being
    a Christian did not do anything for me, and I began to question the validity of
    only remembering God one day a week - Sundays! As with many other Christians too,
    I had become disillusioned with the hypocrisy of the Church and was becoming increasingly
    unhappy with the concept of Trinity and the deification of Jesus. Eventually,
    I began to look into Islam. At first, I was only interested in looking at those
    issues, which specifically dealt with women. I was surprised. What I read and
    learned taught me a lot about myself as a woman, and also about where the real
    oppression of women lies: in every other system and way of life outside of Islam.
    Muslim women have been given their rights in every aspect of the religion with
    clear definitions of their role in society - as had men - with no injustice against
    either of them. As Allah says: Whoever does deeds of righteousness, be they male
    or female, and have faith, they will enter paradise and not the least injustice
    will be done to them [Nisaa 4:124]  <BR>So having amended my misconceptions about
    the true status of women in Islam, I was now looking further. I wanted to find
    that thing which was going to fill the vacuum in my life. My attention was drawn
    towards the beliefs and practices of Islam. It was only through establishing the
    fundamentals that I would understand where to turn and what to prioritize. These
    are often the areas, which receive little attention or controversy in society,
    and when studying the Islamic Creed, it becomes clear why this is the case: such
    concise, faultless and wholly comprehensive details cannot be found elsewhere.  <BR>'

    <BR>Search the first few lines of the 2nd paragraph on Google. This is ridiculous,
    shotgun-blast, religious spamming. Its value in debate here or anywhere is on
    par with yelling at the TV. Why enter a legitimate forum when you can join legions

    if someone makes an unsupported assertion as if it is fact, I&#39;m liable to
    question it, especially if I&#39;m aware of something that suggests it is incorrect
    or misleading. Gerald&#39;s post is a good point: if <i>I</i> were to cite &#39;Approximate
    Global Mission Statistics&#39; from an evangelical Christian source that cites
    only other evangelical Christian sources, I reckon you would pretty quickly accuse
    me of being taken in by their propaganda. Philip Jenkins debunks much of the statistics
    regularly cited to &#39;prove&#39; that Islam is the fastest growing religion,
    pointing out that reliable figures from much of the world, simply are not available,
    but that in many of these areas there is very little Islamic growth through either
    conversion of population growth; much of the statistics simply do not include
    these areas. Even Samuel Huntington, who first suggested that Islam was the fastest
    growing religion, now notes that there was a baby boom in many Islamic countries
    that has now ended, with birth rates in some Islamic countries now lower than
    they were before the baby boom. It is in the interests of <i>some</i> evangelical
    Protestants to spook their donors with fear of an Islamic planet. <BR> <BR>There.
    That&#39;s all I have to say on the topic, and I&#39;m going to ignore this thread
    from now on.'
