  body: "Miguel, the way I understand the contract*, unless Ultrafonts is involved
    in the licensing, I think our fonts are \"stuck\" at Ultrafonts... So a buyer
    can acquire some rights to the fonts directly from you, but he would have to keep
    selling them through Ultrafonts. Ultrafonts's co-ownership of the font files comes
    from the usage of their converter, and of course their patent. I'm talking about
    the TT outline fonts here; the actual bitmaps are indeed wholly owned by the individual
    designers.\r\n\r\n* Assuming they're all the same though - maybe they're not.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, I hope you sell them for a good price - it's a nice collection.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    i have been conversations with Ultrafonts, about my needs to sale my ultrafonts
    collection, to an interesed company or individual. \r\n\r\nThe Ultrafonts co-ownership
    is only for the foundry in ultrafonts.com;\r\n\r\nTTF patented converted fonts
    will be belong to the owner who can use my 6 font families for ANY comercial needs.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward for offers from Foundries or Individuals.\r\n\r\nmh."

    / buyer for your 'six pack', but why dont you continue selling them via UltraFonts,
    or directly via myFonts, maybe.?\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\"

    of my selling is that i wish to know if the six pack can help me to pay some personal
    needs. I wish to know too, how much can others offer to this work, for own them.
    The idea is to sell them soon so any offer is welcome.\r\n\r\nmh"

  body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nHope all is well with you Hrant and Miguel. To help clarify
    things, all of the original Ultrafonts developers are free to sell their fonts
    on the open market in any form they wish and the purchaser has all rights to resell,
    use or whatever else is stipulated in the contract between the font developer
    and purchaser. \r\n\r\nThe purchase however does not have any right to make their
    own Ultrafonts nor can they use the Ultrafonts name or trademark in the font with
    the exception of calling the font family purchased and Ultrafont.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nJose"
