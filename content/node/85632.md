  and that the Arabic writing allows some flexibility and individuality. I observe
  that some of contemporary typefaces consist of elements of different historical
  sources, and I find it natural. But I would like to know the answer (or at least
  your opinions): \r\nHow is combining (of calligraphic styles, adapting solutions
  from one style to a typeface based on another, or [stronger] modification of certain
  shapes) percieved by native  readers or those familiar with Arabic script?  "

    in Naskh that can be brought into Kufi styles (like the middle Ayn) without creating
    problems. You need to maintain the same speed of movement and formality of structure
    though.

  body: "Thank you both.\r\n\r\nI had to analyze the basics of five calligraphic styles,
    to understand (at least superficially) the nature of Arabic script. And finally
    chose Roqah as a guideline for the future font. It's characteristic compression
    of forms seemed to correspond with my idea of reaching some highly expressive,
    biomorfic movement - with the minimum amount of resources. At the stage of reconciling
    the demands of the style, formal idea and the \"readability in the eyes of Pole\",
    I started to be in doubt as to whether introducing some new issues, doesn't look
    eclectic (like, say, cursive Blackletter in Latin). \r\n\r\nNadine, I will think
    for some time about what you wrote; thank you."

  body: "Though easiest on the eye + smoothest in hand (maximum speed of movement?),
    \r\nit is the most challenging to design because its letters go on piling, and
    consequently \u2014 in contrary to a boatload in water\u2014, it is the baseline
    (surface of water) that has to be moved up and down, necessitating uneven line
    spacings.\r\n-\r\nThat's why it is used for boatload headlines but never for text.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84552\r\n"

  body: "<em>This style is extremally difficult, indeed. I had chosen it as an inspiration,
    rather than as a guideline, as I wrote... I am not able to manage it.</em>\r\n\r\nBut
    I would like to put my concerns aside, and ask another question, which is a part
    of my problem:\r\n\r\nIn a simplified typeface, both words - \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062C\u0648\u0649
    and \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062D\u0648\u0649 - have the same form of Jeem and Hah.
    This situation is self-explanatory. But how would the possible introduction of
    stylistic alternates change the perception of the typeface? Is it more \"human\"
    then or more readable? I can learn some technical rules, but I can't get the insight,
    to understand them..."
