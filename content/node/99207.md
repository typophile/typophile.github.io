body: "Hi... what started out as a novice attempt to organize a publishing firm computer
  network and design assets (from art scraps to fonts), I have personally been intrigued
  by how difficult it is to accurately categorize the Sans-serifs. Various forums
  have pointed to the 'g' as a defining marker... but this seems to be not always
  the case...\r\n\r\nAs an example, the line between 'grotesk/grotesque' and 'neo-grotesk'
  seems blurry, specifically in modern designs of even historical typefaces (with
  optical kerning, etc.). So, here is how my first take on drawing the line between
  grotesk and neo grot (and between neo-grot and humanist, not included in this list).
  The Humanist and Geometric are also another kettle of fish. But is this correct,
  so far ?\r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\nGrotesk\r\n\r\n[Berthold] Akzidenz Grotesk\r\n[OurType]

    classified as Grotesque rather than neogrotesque...\r\n\r\n... it's a little weird
    that no one from this forum (a forum seemingly dedicated to more technical aspects
    of typography) has commented on the above list...\r\n\r\nC'est la vie..."

  body: '@hrant... thanks for the feedback... but I''m not sure I understand why classification
    is "hopeless"... there is a difference between baroque and abstract art, yes?
    So, there must be a difference between grotesque and neo-grotesque ?'

  body: "@hrant... very useful leads... if I can reduce this down to a root observation:
    the task is partially about \"classification\" and partially about \"utility\"
    ?  Meaning, book publishing tends to lean more toward the serifs, but there is
    a \"feel\" to publishing in Minion or Arno or even Bodoni (for, say, a Jane Ayre
    novel) which might not be appropriate for publishing a newspaper (say, Greta or
    Periodico), or for business reports (say, Kepler or FF More Pro)...\r\nI once
    saw Orwell's 1984 published using Franklin Gothic which was, I thought, fitting
    for the stark subject matter...\r\n\r\nAnyway... the journey continues...\r\n\r\nThanks..."

    Do you wish to sort the typefaces you have licensed according to suitable use?\r\n\r\nIs
    there even a clear definition of neo grotesque? (I tend to think of them as normalised
    grotesques \u2013 as opposed to the \u201Cfunky\u201D execution of for example
    Maple) If anything, they should sort <em>under</em>, and not next to, grotesques. "
