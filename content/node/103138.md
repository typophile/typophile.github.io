body: "Thinking more about http://typophile.com/node/102265#comment-554633, I realized
  that I know zilch about fonts used on the older-generations typewriters.  You know:
  those before Selectric\u2019s changeable type (or was there changeable type before
  IBM?), and before Courier.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n(For Selectric, it is clear what to
  do: the specimens are supposed to be available from IBM on http://ibmcomposer.org/joomla/images/stories/fonts/ComposerFonts.pdf,
  but this download is broken; I used http://luc.devroye.org/IBMSelectricComposerFonts.pdf.)\r\n\r\nAll
  I could find on typophile is the discussion of keycap's font on http://typophile.com/node/60016,
  and the what-is-this-typewriter police academy paper mentioned on http://typophile.com/node/58501#comment-480816
  (and this paper mentions only shapes of a handful of letters, and not combinations).
  \ Well, there is also http://typophile.com/node/16094, but I cannot make anything
  from this.  So: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how was the font for the first typewriter chosen?\r\n<li>why
  so ugly?  Is it to hide unreliable positioning of letters on the line? (And, in
  pre-electric times, variable strike force?)\r\n<li>how much choice of different
  types was actually there? (Within a manufacturer, or across manufactures?)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Ilya"

    were chosen, but it is reasonable to presume that the choice reflected current
    trends in metal typography, as seen in this photo of the Hansen Writing Ball,
    the first commercially-available machine.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Writing_ball_keyboard_3.jpg\">\r\n\r\nWhy
    so ugly? One-word answer: monospacing.\r\n\r\nThere were a wide varieties of choices
    of type both within and across manufacturers. ATF specimen books of the early
    twentieth century regularly featured a dozen or more typewriter-emulation typefaces."

  body: "The main issue, indeed, is that the letters were designed so as to compensate
    for the fact that they were monospaced. Over the years, designers got more practiced
    at dealing with that, and more attractive typewriter typestyles were developed,
    that more closely approximated the look of printing types, like Diplomat and Bookface
    Academic for the Selectric.\r\n\r\nBut the first people who invented typewriters
    couldn't afford to go out and hire a professional type designer."

  body: I still have some doubt about the principal reason for ugliness being the
    monowidth.  For example, Cyrillic is more-or-less monowidth with most any font,
    but the ugliness of typewriter fonts is still there.

  body: " I was thinking to assume the very first ones, the prototypes, were just
    punches, or type, from a relatively even-bodied font, trimmed and affixed onto
    hammers. If something was too wide, then they found something narrower from any
    font, or had someone engrave the few wide characters on narrower widths. In production,
    I think they had in-house engravers to cut punches for striking into molds containing
    hammer and letter in one piece. The designs usually look to have come from softened
    letterpress designs in monospaced versions. \r\n\r\n\"why so ugly? Is it to hide
    unreliable positioning of letters on the line? (And, in pre-electric times, variable
    strike force?)\"\r\n\r\nI think \"ugly\", \"unreliable positioning\" and \"variable
    strike force\" in typewriting are only seen that way in our time. In their time,
    one kept and used their machine as well as they could, and people lived with the
    results until it was time for a new writing partner or a new typewriter. "
