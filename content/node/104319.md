    Especially combined with shadow elements. Looking forward to see it in use.\r\n\r\nHow

  body: "The basic shapes are constructed / (de)constructed / (deco)nstructed like
    a Novo Typo character-shape should be... according to our aesthetics...\r\nThis
    set of fonts are an invitation for designers to play around with colors, layers,
    shadows... it's up to you, anything what you can imagine... According to the Novo
    Typo philosophy: we deliver the bricks; the designer is building the house...
    \r\nThe characterset (basic Latin) is complete and sufficient for display use,
    we also added a set of arrows and even a Rupee sign. We are offering the possibility
    to design extra characters or customize Guru to your needs.\r\nWe invite all designers
    to send pics with all our typefaces in use. We will be happy to show them on our
    facebookpage: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Novo-Typo/282456691809567 or contact
    us via http://www.novotypo.nl/"
