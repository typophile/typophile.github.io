  that was used on the various gravestones. It was amazing.\r\n\r\nThe full collection
  of pics is over [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/armorath/sets/72157625322505394/|on
  my Flickr]] but here are soem samples I thought were especially interesting. \r\n\r\nI
  noticed a trend for this type of lettering/type that I could not identify, and I
  think it's quite striking, does anyone know if it has a name?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gravestone_sample_6672.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
  was also this one used from 1912 until 1970 on this gravestone - yet the style is
  quite consistent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gravestone_sample_2_3637.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  finally, does anyone know what this monogram/symbol means? I saw it quite a lot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gravestone_sample_3_6309.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
  are plenty of more samples and other types of lettering over at the flikr page,
  so if you're interested, go take a look.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
