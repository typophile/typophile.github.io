  to one that could be found at an Irish Pub.  I have looked around and have yet to
  find anything that will work.  I was wondering if you could provide me with some
  recommendations.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nScott Forbes  "

  body: I haven't made it it Ire, yet, but there seems to be a lot of great <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/sets/72157602552287340/">hand-lettered
    pub signs</a> all around England. In this vein, I'd check out stuff from LHF <a
    href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/stratford.shtml">Stratford</a> might
    be one to look at.

  body: "I searched on [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=kells|kells]]
    at myfonts.com and got some possibilities, although \"irish uncial\" would probably
    give you much the same results.\r\n\r\nLater edit:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.diningpubs.com|Dining
    Pubs]] and [[http://www.irishmusicbars.com|Irish Music Bars]] have extensive lists
    of Irish pubs, along with photographs; although the photos are somewhat small,
    you can often see the signs pretty well."

    but if you scroll to the bottom you will see a photo of a book cover flanked by
    arrows to the left and right. Click on either arrow to navigate forwards or backwards
    through a gallery of images of Irish typefaces employed in different contexts.
    \r\n\r\nThe gallery contains several pictures of Irish pub signs."
