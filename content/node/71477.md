body: "I created a font for a school assignment a while ago, and I'm having a little
  trouble with Open-Type in order to make it work properly.see the font here: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Shoelace-Typefeet/465085\r\nSince
  the typeface uses shoes as characters, I needed it to be like this:\r\nRight foot,
  Left foot,Right foot, Left foot,Right foot, Left foot,\r\n\r\nAt first I just put
  all the right feet in uppercase glyphs and left feet in lowercase glyphs, so you
  needed to type ThIs WaY to make it work (not the best solution, but I had a tight
  deadline). Now I am trying to find an open-type solution to make it look right regardless
  of how you write, but I'm not sure about which open-type feature I should use.\r\nI
  am a bit of a noob at Font Lab, so any help would be appreciated.\r\n(and sorry
  if my english is a bit confusing)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "Try the Contextual Alternates 'calt' feature.\r\n\r\nFirst, I suggest you
    make all the default characters right feet glyphs, so that regardless of whether
    the user types upper or lowercase characters the text always begins on a right
    foot. Then make a 'calt' contextual lookup that replaces a right foot glyph with
    a left foot glyph when preceded by a right foot.\r\n\r\nYou need to think about
    what you want to happen across wordspace boundaries. Using L and R as foot indicators,
    do you want\r\n\r\nRLRLR LRLRL RLRLR...\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nRLRLR RLRLR RLRLR...\r\n\r\nIf
    you want the first option, then your contextual substitution needs to have two
    contexts: when preceded by right foot and when preceded by right foot + space."

  body: "So, let me see if I got it:\r\n\r\n1-Put Right Foot (R) on all regular glyphs\r\n2-Create
    alternate glyphs (calt) for every regular glyph with the Left Foot (L) in it\r\n3-Add
    a rule to replace RR by RL\r\n\r\nIs that it?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help/attention!"
