body: "Sorry I don't have an example. I'm pulling from the collective pool here. I'm
  looking for a Sans Serif where the standard e is styled like an italicized <em>e</em>.
  I've seen examples around, the most recent was the text on the back of the Arrested
  Development DVD case. I don't have it, or I'd scan and post (Google only had front
  covers and everything is in UPPERCASE). \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be helpful."

  body: "ITC Atelier Sans and Triplex Sans are very identical. But, I like the simplistic
    form of JTT's Aspect, which is more of what I was hoping to find. And it all hinges
    on that e. It's strange how few Sans there are that stylized e.\r\n\r\nAny more
    suggestions? "

  body: Choosing a typeface based on one character is inadvisable. It might be better
    to choose the typeface that works best and then edit the 'e' so it's exactly as
    you want it.

  body: 'True. It''s weird, I can imagine the text but I can''t remember where I saw
    it or what it''s for and for this I should apologize. I shouldn''t be asking for
    a type identification without proper examples. I was hoping the braintrust here
    at Typophile could help. It''s not a live or die situation though. I do appreciate
    the suggestions that have been made by Stephen and Nick. '

  body: 'That''s close but the e has a sharp corner. Are there any Sans where the
    e is almost a complete circle (not sure if that''s actually right.) It''ll look
    like an uninterrupted stroke, very fluid without any pinch points, not necessary
    an perfect circle, but close. '

  body: "Right now, it's purely for my benefit. I've been noticing this style \"e\"
    for a while now and every time I see it I want to ask about it, but of course
    it's always when I'm away from my computer and when I do get back to the computer,
    I usually forget to ask with a relevant example in mind. The style looks fresh
    and new, and I just assumed it could be a new face that's starting to get popular.
    Hence the picky nature of getting as many suggestions as possible. \r\n\r\nHopefully
    I see another example or remember where I've seen them in the past and put a decent
    sample to be ID'ed. \r\n\r\nI do appreciate all the responses and I'm sorry this
    is a wild goose chase. "

    really know the look you are after. You can use the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html\">Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide</a>, and search for all the style codes that use the non-horizontal
    crossbar on the 'e', starting with Codes 1 and 3 and working your way down the
    pages.\r\n\r\nMaybe that will help you pick something according to the look.\r\n\r\n-

    remember to post for ID. It's hard to describe a font without an example and based
    on a single character from memory.\r\n\r\nFor all I know, it might have been an
    italic e that I thought was a standard e anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the responses
    everyone. I do appreciate the attempt."
