body: It&#39;s been stretched, squooshed and badly redrawn, but does anyone know what
  typeface this signage was derived from? My first guess was Albertus, but it lacks
  a wedge atop the A, for instance. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22709.jpg"

  body: Holland Title looks promising, although I can&#39;t find a decent  sample
    of it online. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205066"

    <BR>And that S looks straight out of an uncial.

  body: I think Marc hit it when he said uncial. Look at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-hammer-unziale/"
    target="_blank">Neue Hammer Uncial</a>&#39;s caps. &#40;BTW, some books show this
    as American Uncial &#40;Mecanorma&#41;, but Myfonts selections with that name
    are true uncials, without these caps.&#41;

  body: Celtic Bold looks like an American Uncial rip-off.  <BR>The American Uncial
    by Mecanorma I found in the  <BR>FontBook is a better match than Neue Hammer Uncial,  <BR><i>AND</i>
    it has the correct caps, Mike. I&#39;d go for that.

  body: Dueling font ID&#39;s. Not so fast. I still think that Yves was right about
    Celtic Bold. Here is American Uncial Bold &#40;ICG&#41; -- one Grant should recognize
    -- credited to Oldstyle in the Image Club catalog from my old Letterpress Collection.
    It came in 6 weights including open and Initials, with regular and bold weights
    of each. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22721.gif"

  body: Mike, that&#39;s a good one, Celtic Bold is definitely a rip-off from American
    Uncial Bold.
