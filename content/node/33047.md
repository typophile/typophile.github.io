  sure it's a complete character set, as there is more text set with it elsewhere
  on the package.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\ntyler"

    Khaki </a> with the spots knocked off and a slight horizontal squoosh\u2122.\r\n\r\nAFAIK,
    it was bundled free with either OS or browser software a few years back."

  body: "sweet. thanks ben.\r\n\r\nthey really cleaned up the ragged edges of all
    the letterforms though, aside from using the 'splotchless' version of the font.
    i much prefer the smooth lines in the custom version.\r\n\r\nthanks again for
    your help!"
