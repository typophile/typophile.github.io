body: Hello,  <BR>I have a project where I have to choose a real-time event such as
  an object &#40;eating popcorn etc&#41; or event &#40;such as going to a place&#41;
  or anything I am interested in, and convey the sound&#40;s&#41; of it using only
  type. <BR> <BR>I am thinking about doing mine about a visit to an art gallery, and
  conveying the levels of sound eg. background noise, people&#39;s discussions etc
  maybe. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know any examples on the net, books about this sort
  of thing or inspiration that may help me? <BR>Or let me know what you think would
  be an interesting sound to convey.

  body: Cheryl, <BR> <BR>If you can get your hands on <a href="http://www.baselinemagazine.com/"
    target="_blank">Baseline</a>, No 42, there is a great article called <i>Hearing
    Type.</i> There are some very interesting examples of printed materials and information
    based on things such as the relationships between typography and musical notation,
    as well as visual typographic structures in relation to musical timing. Some student
    work is also included, showcasing typography that mimics tonal properties in music,
    such as amplitude and pitch. It is really an interesting read, I recommend it
    highly. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps, <BR>Z.

  body: Cheryl, I&#39;m from Manhattan a city known for its sounds from the Bronx
    to Chinatown. The bridges and subways to bustling midtown. The sounds of Rockefeller
    Center at Christmas and Coney Island during the summer.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest
    exploring some of these sounds to give your typographic pallet some depth. Mermers
    in a museum seems rather tame and what is the type for  a cell phone conversation
    anyway.

  body: I think they may have it at my university library, going to check tomorrow...
    <BR> <BR>I suppose I picked a museum at first because I like the feeling of calm
    in there!  But I am from London I suppose it might be similar in places to Manhattan,
    as you described, I am all too familiar with the hustle and bustle on London Underground
    and Central London. It can be quite nice but also good to get some peace :D

  body: What about all that concrete typographic stuff? <BR>Also check out &#34;Telephone
    Book&#34; by Avital Ronell. <BR>There&#39;s also some interesting stuff in the
    archives <BR>here actually, IIRC. <BR> <BR>BTW, it strikes me that an interesting
    sound-event to convey would be a thunderstorm. <BR> <BR>hhp
