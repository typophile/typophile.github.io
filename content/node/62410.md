  In the classrooms, I observed that they had prominently displayed notices with instructions
  on what to do in the event of a lock-down or evacuation.\r\n\r\nThe typeface they
  used for these notices was, of course, Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nI remarked that if they
  were going to use that face, they might as well go the whole nine yards and add
  hearts and rainbows and smiley faces. My daughter accused me of being a font nerd.
  It\u2019s a fair cop.\r\n\r\n(I\u2019m old enough to remember when lock-downs were
  something that they only did in prisons, but that\u2019s another topic.)\r\n\r\n\u2014Jim

    is a good pick, of it\u2019s to be taken seriously, read and understood what font
    would you pick?\r\n\r\nScenario: There's a gunman or cougar on the loose - the
    kids are panicking, the teachers have locked themselves in the supplies cupboard
    \u2013 what would be the best possible font to use to get the procedures across
    to the kids to avoid them getting mauled or shot? \r\n"

  body: "Font nerd that I am, I paid more attention to the school typography than
    to the stuff I really ought to; good thing my wife was there to listen to the
    teachers.\r\n\r\nHappily, no Papyrus to be seen anywhere. There was Comic Sans
    for signs telling what to do in life-or-death situations, Helvetica for room numbers
    and other directional signage, and a very Celtic uncial face used to promote Spanish
    language classes. (There were(/are?) Celtic people in the Spanish region of Galicia,
    but I doubt that the sign designer knew that.)\r\n\r\nActually, based on what
    I saw, I suspect that the students are more clued in about appropriate font selection
    than are the school administrators. A hopeful sign.\r\n\r\nJim Tubman\r\nCalgary,

    to post a funeral notice.

    the title of a manual of heavy rail operating prcedures set in CS?\r\n\r\n(Getting
    into and out of a shool without seeing Comic Sans put to strange and amusing purposes
    would be pretty amazing)\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
