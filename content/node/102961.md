    but beware. Bay Animation is known of copying fonts without a licence. Don\u2019t
    know if this is original or a copy of <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?26T\">Elegant
    Garamond</a> which looks to me fairly close. "

  body: "And Elegant Garamond is just Bitstream\u2019s copy of Linotype\u2019s Granjon
    \u2026 Compared with Granjon (was: Elegant Garamond) the logo appears rather blunt
    to me. As if you (or the person that did Elephant) made it a little bit thicker
    by having an outline drawn around it, like in artificially boldening a typeface."
