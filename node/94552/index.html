As yet unnamed, I started working on it in December 2010 and it's been left to fester for quite some time. Just started on it again recently. So far it's a very basic character set, light and bold (other weights will be interpolated). I'm not too happy with the spacing yet and there's no kerning.
Anyway, what do you think so far?

		<div class="commentbody">While I think that it does harmonise, I do want to put more of an obvious corner in the counter of o in the light (more like it is in the b now). I think I was trying too hard to get it almost monoline in that weight, and keeping that interpolatable with the *black* weight has made for some lumpy looking strokes in certain glyphs. Hrant, g and a were my main concerns before. I'll have a play around with them and post results soon. You're right, of course, I've definitely chickened out on the g ear.
PS. just noticed, looking at the image now, that the blend fonts function in Fontlab seems to have smoothed some nodes that are meant to be corners. The s for example should be much more angular than it looks there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was kind of thinking that about the K, but I quite like the x. Thanks for your praise of the numerals; I always find them some of the hardest glyphs to draw - especially 6 and 9. These are tabular figures so the zero can't go much wider without increasing the advance width of all numerals, including the light, which makes the spacing a bit too loose IMO. I'll likely have proportional figures too so that zero might be a touch wider.</div>

In the black, the top counter of g is noticeably smaller than the bottom, but in the light they are more even. Do they work with each other? Also tamed the top right serif on k and x and removed over shoot on K. I think these are looking better now.</div>

One moment I look at it and think the overshoot is too much, the next moment, too little. So I'm hoping that means it's juuuuuuuuust right. Anything next to a z looks big though.

/v/ looks like it is riding high on the baseline.
/w/ looks taller than its neighbors.
Perhaps the humps of /m/n/h/ could be a touch taller. Loop of /k/ too.
That inside contour of /n/ (etc.) on the right side seems like the most tentative drawing. 
Maybe the counter of /o/ could be tilted toward the italic angle more.

These are the two options. While I like the diagonal cuts (2) more, they don't work well at all with uppercase letters which are flat on the baseline, so I'm going to stick with the flat terminals (1)

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Italics:</em> I like the /R/, it has an original, distinctive shape, there's no need to tweak it in my opinion. It's lowercase counterpart /r/, however, is clearly too wide. It gives the impression of falling forward. /Q/ is wonderful! I'm not sure about the top right of /x/. The top right serif of /K/ could grow more to the right.

<em>Roman:</em> The last sentence also goes to /k/. /k/ is also too wide. The serifs of /u/ in the light weight are too short. In the bold and regular weight /e/ has a "big nose". To fix this bring the terminal nearer to the eye's right end (horizontally, of course). You may compare with the italics, where this problem is unexistant. The weight of the different serifs in /t/ and /x/ is unbalanced. I would definitely keep working on /g/. It reminds me of an intestine :-) which doesn't mean it's badly drawn, just that it's not what you're looking for.

<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/2/9/3262384/g.png">

In my opinion, you could improve it by taking into account the following:
- In practically all text fonts the blue area has an even thickness.
- The blue area normally slopes downwards or stays horizontal, and doesn't necessarily has to sit on the baseline.
- The thin-thick transition in the red area is "uncertain".

Personally, I would dispose of one of the two right crooks. /g/ has a very complex structure in comparison with the rest of your alphabet, not counting that it itself is the most complex constructed letter.

Hope it helps ;-)</div>

I agree with most of your points on the italic. I don't mind the |x| though; the serifs relate to the |s| and (to a lesser extent) |r| and |c|.

Roman
k - yes I suppose it was slightly wide, but it's a toss up between width and counter size and I erred towards getting the counters more in keeping with the rest than the width. I've trimmed it slightly since then and it's now the same width as the h.
e - you're right, I'd already changed this but have yet to post updates as concentrating more on italic.
u light - It's not just the |u|. I'm going to extend the serifs throughout the light weight, and perhaps loosen the spacing slightly as I do it.
t and x - I agree some problems with light |x| but others I think are ok. I've thickened bottom right of |e|, |c| and |t| since last images posted, so difference between crossbar and bottom is not as big. I like the left of the crossbar looking thicker than the right. I don't know why, just feels better to me that way.

g - in most recent iteration, the 'blue area' is closer to horizontal, and the red area is more clearly thin, and joins the blue area with a corner instead of a curve. It probably still looks like an intestine to you, but I like it...

This is Roman as it stands now. I've yet to extend serifs on light.</div>

Thumbs up for that!

/R/,/K/,/X/ and /A/ are more interesting with a curved diagonal. As Riccardo said, especially /K/ profits from it.

<blockquote>Where to draw the line?</blockquote>
Which line? You mean it figuratively?

An idea/temptation: If you slanted the crossbar of the italic /t/ (which looks good to my eyes), why not also the descender-serifs of /p/?</div>

Honestly, I didn't try this because I looked at similar fonts which also didn't do this. Here's what they'd look like (on |q| too).

If a broader overhaul isn't in the plans, certainly the roman bold /k/ arm and /x/ have problems. 

I kinda liked the trapping but you should be adding that at the end if at all to save yourself headaches. 

Italic /m/s are too wide, and probably /w/s too.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, working on getting the roman and italic right before doing any other styles. I've changed |k| and |x| in the roman - you're right, Craig, that arm wasn't working. Raised tittles in light weight, and narrowed the |m| and (to a lesser extant) |w| in the light italic (I thought the black italic was ok as it was).
In the light roman, I've brought down the junction with the stem in letters like h, n, and b, and brought it up in letters like d, q, and u. I think this makes a big difference - getting closer to the look of the italic. Don't think it's needed so much in the black italic, so I left them alone.

Getting a little tired of quick brown foxes so used one of Craig's pangrams.

That light roman ampersand is looking down a bit. gotta change that.</div>

Any better? Crossbar of 2 and 4 has been thinned a touch. I've also brought middle of 3 down slightly to avoid it looking too cramped at top. Widened the italic 4 slightly.

I will sort out new pdf soon-ish. In the meantime, here's another idea for the link in the g, so the middle counter echoes the bottom counter a bit more. I think I prefer it already.

Ben, you're right about the spacing. I like to get rough spacing down to dictate the design of the glyphs, but fine tuning and kerning I prefer to get help with. I know there are differing opinions about using services like iKern, but I was very happy with the results on Vulpa, so I figure why spend ages doing it (badly) when I can get someone else to do it quickly (and well).</div>

A few updates...
I've moved the apex of the sharp arches more to the centres of the glyphs and raised the points where the curve meets the stem (right side of n) and lowered the points where the straight bit meets stem (left side of n). I've adjusted black x and light question mark, but I think c and e are ok. I've noticed since posting this image that the bowl of d (and p) in the black weight is too small compared to b and q, so I've changed that but not in the image above.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's definitely an improvement to the prior (regular weighted) /a/. The construction seems fine to me as you have it now. The proposition of Craig is worth considering, though. ITC Galliard has a beautiful /a/ ;-)

What has to be corrected is, in my opinion, the shape of the white space of /a/'s bowl.† Now it doesn't suit the other white spaces very well. Look for example at Albertus.

A second observation would be that the top of the bowl (still in the regular weight) gets thicker in the middle, while in the bold weight it thins gradually towards the joint.

I also agree with hrant about the /g/.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I'm thinking about f-ligatures. At the moment I've not made any but I have made an alternate f which would be substituted via calt feature in front of letters with ascenders on left-hand-side and 'i's (bottom row in image). My problem with this is A LOT of end users don't have calts on as default (nomatter how hideous the results!) whereas most do have ligatures on by default. I'm forced to make fi and fl ligatures, but should I make all the others with the alternative f, leave combinations like fh to be kerned if calt is not turned on, or make 'proper' (ie. joining) ligatures for the usual (ff, fi, fl, ffl, fh, ffb etc.etc.)?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/falt_4823.png]
A quick go at joining ligatures kind of persuades me not to go down that route:

You'd be surprised. It's very noticeable to me because the calts in my fonts so far have mainly been for endforms and more seamless connections in script fonts, so when the end user doesn't have them turned on, you can tell very easily. Why they can't tell is another matter; don't even get me started on tracking script fonts!

Anyway... I'm working on connected ligatures for the Roman now to see if they can look ok.</div>

BTW you might want to remove the inside serif on the left stem - or at least do with it something like what you've done on the inside of the leg of the "R".

The "fi" and "fl" are too dense in the roman.

Small caps are in progress - for the italic, they are mainly a slanted Roman (Q is like the italic) but I'm wondering how to deal with the more lowercase-like UC glyphs (A, K, R, U and X). I think the kick at the bottom which works well with lowercase doesn't work so well in all caps (or small caps if I changed them too) settings. I was thinking of reintroducing the more standard slanted roman forms of these uppercase letters, but I'm undecided about where to put them. Standard as default and lc-like as salt or stylistic set, or the other way round, or with standard forms in CASE function (and probably in smcp too).

These are the two possible cap styles in different settings:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/army_6192.png]
1. lc style with small caps
2. standard with small caps
3. lc style all caps
4. standard all caps
5. lc style with lc
6. standard with lc

I'm leaning towards having the standard as default and the lc style as stylistic set, but I fear that alternates just end up unused.

PS. please ignore spacing issues for now!</div>

The pdf is basically a showing of the proposed weights. Here's a smaller jpg version

I think the middle three weights could do with being slightly bolder than they are now - the difference between light and regular is barely noticeable and between bold and black too much.</div>

A few suggestions to take or leave:
 - roman /f/ appears to lean rightward, moreso in the lighter weights. Extending the bottom right serif might help. (I don't know that the lean in itself is a problem, but extending that serif will help with spacing at any rate.)
 - roman /g/ I think that corner at the northeast of the bottom bowl is yet too angular for my eyes, but maybe you have it where you want it. Could the ear take a tiny bit more weight?
 - is roman /c/ a little light?
 - small caps could be a touch darker in every weight. I like the stemmed /U/!
 - /m/ is too wide I think, certainly in italic at least.
 - the (illusory) upslant of the italic /f/ and /t/ crossbars may be too strong.
 - in the lighter weights, italic /g/'s counters look out of balance, with the lower one looking pinched. Keep the structure for sure -- it's great -- but consider tweaking the proportions.
 - loop of italic /k/ looks pinched, too.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Craig
I've extended /f/ serif slightly on light master. Tried a more curved corner to the bottom bowl of /g/. I think I like it. Put a touch more weight on the ear but I don't think any more is necessary.
The roman /c/ was light (in black weight anyway). I'd already thickened the bottom (and bottom of /e/ too) a bit but I agree with you that it still looked light. Hopefully this one's better.
I disagree on small caps. I do think they look light in darker weights but this is a spacing issue; I just need to track them a bit tighter.
I like the /m/as it is, and the /f/ and /t/ crossbars I quite like as they are.
I agree with you on italic /g/ and I've balanced it a bit better in the light weight. I think I was too caught up on keeping the top counter in line with the /a/, but I think it's much better now.
Tweaked /k/ slightly.

Arched letters too wide in the italics? /u/ and /a/ and /h/ look wide to me. /k/ also.

Interesting italics, I like the choppiness, but proportions may need slight tweaking; overall a bit wide. 

Open up the spacing on the light.

Comma's head is too roundy. Look at something like Dolly?

Bold lining 5 may be too wide. In fact, all the 5s are slightly wide I think, may be worth checking.

/P/ and /R/ look a bit high-waisted, is that intentional?

Cap /J/ is interesting, I'd have to see it in a word to tell if it works. The tail is very clipped. That could be quite cool.

Sterling, why is the crossbar not passing through to the left side?

Cap /M/ in all weights perhaps too wide?

/v/ and /w/ in the bold seem to align at different x-heights. (But rasterising differently when I zoom in, sometimes the v is taller, sometimes shorter)

Italic /Q/, yes!

4 looks narrow, are these tabular figs? 

Overall, caps feel less relaxed, especially /BCD/ and /G/, I'd pull them wider. 

Hope to return soon ;)
