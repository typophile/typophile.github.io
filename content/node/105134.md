  body: if these are the only 3 letters, and no more, i'd say custom starting with
    Blair. the curves don't seem consistently applied to me. note the S has curved
    terminals on only one side yet the N is curved both sides. Blair Medium with a
    bit of stroke might create the general effect on all edges and leave just the
    terminals for modification. ?
