  best font available. I noticed the little characteristic of the lower case \"y\".
  I've decided to remove it, so the typo doesn't compete with the symbol I'm making.\r\n\r\nIt's
  always good to know the reasons for the rules you're breaking, though. So I'm wondering
  if there is anything I should know."

    converge. It's drawn this way in a number of fonts. There's also a common difficulty
    that to make the inside counterspace large enough, the junction has to extend
    below the baseline \u2014 this solution avoids that."

    have it descend lower than the baseline?\r\n\r\nJust found your logo forum, I'll
    have to check if I can post my sketch there."

  body: "Christer, \r\n\r\nalso, in your variant, the lines don't optically align.
    The left edge of the aperture (top opening) and of the descending part don't align
    in your example -- the left edge of the descending part looks too much off to
    the left. If you look at other letters such as x, they are often drawn in a similar
    way (there is no geometric alignment but instead, an optical one). The problem
    of two intersecting diagonal bars is that, especially when the angle is minimal,
    the optical illusion makes them appear as if the edges wouldn't align. \r\n"

    seem to align at all :) Suppose I'll just align it geometrically and then fiddle
    and tweak until it looks right. Hope the descender doesn't end up so small it
    looks like a \"v\" with some horrible mutation"

    to the y. The left edge of the descender still had to be a bit further to the
    left than it would be if it were geometrically aligned. I also made a small change
    to the left arm (if that's the correct term)\r\n\r\nLooks to me like I'm done,
