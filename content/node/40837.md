    Will hopefully remember. '

    this isn''t spot on but it''s close. The ''T'' and the ''R'' are very similar
    though.'

    Guide. [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_fg/griffo_classico_full.gif|Griffo
    Classico]] by Franko Luin has the structural earmarks, although the top serif
    on the A isn't the same. I'm still looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dooleytype/aviano/\">Aviano</a> has
    a similar head serif on the A and a similar R, but the rest of the letters are
    markedly different. Also, it is generously extended compared to the Tub Hauler
    sample.\r\n\r\nThe only other vaguely similar font I can find with a head serif
    on the A is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/imperium/\">Imperium</a>,
    but it is not as similar to the sample, and the rest of the letters are even less
    similar."

  body: "That's <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Paul Lloyd's</a> Imperator Small Caps Bold.\r\n\r\nExcept for
    a few experiments, Lloyd's inspiration was type and lettering found in old sources.
    Unfortunately, he was a poor record keeper. He told me that himself, once, when
    I inquired about the inspiration for one of his fonts. Not only couldn't he not
    give attribution for most of his fonts - he couldn't even remember the source
    material for many. Somewhere, in some old catalog, magazine, graveyard or whatever
    is the original for this font - or at least the base Imperator Roman font. I wish
    I knew what that was.\r\n\r\nAh well. There are some jewels in his creations and
    I'm glad he made 'em."
