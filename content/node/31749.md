  body: "If you haven't already been through it, <em>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</em>
    by Josef M\xFCller-Brockmann is probably the best historical source you'll find\u2014a
    great piece of high modernism.\r\n\r\n<em>Making and Breaking the Grid</em> by
    Timothy Samara is a decent book about Grids in practice, and has a few bits of
    history in there as well. Maybe not the best book research though, it's more of
    a guided tour for brainstorming ideas. Still, with full color and bleeds, it's
    pretty amazing that this can be had at under $20. There's plenty more also, I'm
    sure you'll get plenty of good input.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "I think many designers work out systematic approaches but don't share so
    much beyond the fundamentals. It has all changed a bit with digital type as well\u2014not
    being bound to the point system so tightly.\r\n\r\nYou've got to keep a little
    for yourself, and this is so clearly a part of design where you can differentiate
    yourself."
