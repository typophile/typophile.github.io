    - can you tell us why Proforma doesn't work for you? That will help in finding
    alternatives. Here are a couple more:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Fresco

  body: "I'm working on a book about designer/artist [[http://www.jacquesbilodeau.com|Jacques
    Bilodeau]]. This guy in his way has been some sort of pionneer. His early works
    are also known for beeing really square, he works a lot with folded steel sheets.
    Obviously, the book will feature many pictures, but also a beautiful text. I want
    to set the text in a serif that will reflect the pioneering and squarish aspect
    of bilodeau's work. Proforma would suit this text quiet well because of the way
    the serifs are managed. Actually, it's not that Proforma doesn't work, but I was
    wondering if another typeface could do the job. So I have to avoid typefaces that
    are too curvy, or that are based on old drawings. I saw a wonderful typeface,
    developed by Nicole Dotin during her MA in Reading, [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/images/front/Elena_Preview.pdf|Elena]],
    the problem is that it wilI be released in 2008. I was thinking of Fedra Serif.
    I should also say that the font will be paired with Akkurat. I really like Relato,
    I think I'll buy it though I won't use it on this project. The overall feeling
    of Fedra Serif and Proforma are much more modern to me.\r\n\r\nI hope these precisions
    will help.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    me of Majoor's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_ot/\">FF

  body: "Thank you Stephen, but Swift is a bit to dark. I'm using Akkurat at a really
    small size besides my text blocks, the contrast between Akkurat and the serif
    is much better when text is set in Proforma. \r\n\r\nI've been thinking of Collis,
    but at the same size, Proforma is a bit more open. Also, Suite Serif and On Serif
    from Text Axis would suit my project well, but as far as I know, there not available
    to the public. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'll end up working with Proforma."
