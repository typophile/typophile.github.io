  for graduating with a Graphic Design degree in May. Does anyone have suggestions
  regarding typefaces to use for the body text (to explain the work) for the PDF version
  I create which I will use to e-mail (if asked for in addition to website) potential
  employers? \r\n\r\nI'm looking for an extremely legible screen font but that also
  has character. I don't need to worry about print too much because it would be a
  rare occurrence that someone would print it out. I've read that Proxima Nova is
  a great screen font, but I don't feel like it adds enough in the way of giving the
  presentation a personality. I've tried Gotham, and though its a great typeface I
  am not loving it in this context. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
  \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think it's very unfortunate that graphic designers aren't properly being
    taught typography. I'm currently in my first year at the art academy again (initially
    in 2007) and there's barely any typography education to speak of, and what's still
    there is disappearing. It's even disappearing at the Royal Academy of Arts in
    The Hague, which has always been known for its typography courses along with the
    university of Reading.\r\n\r\nI'm not insinuating your question is invalid though.
    I still ask the same questions despite having studied typography for years. I'm
    just saying type doesn't get the attention it deserves in the educational systems,
    and as such most graphic designers don't learn the value.\r\n\r\nAre you looking
    for typefaces like Proxima Nova and Gotham or were these recommended? Incidentally
    I'm working on a custom typeface for a company that is currently using Proxima
    Nova for their presentations to clients but would like to replace it with my design.
    Proxima Nova works very well for them though.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned Proxima
    Nova and Gotham I'm assuming you're looking for a clear, legible sans with a bit
    more character. Something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/okay-type/alright-sans/|Alright
    Sans]] perhaps?"

  body: "Hi Martin, \r\n\r\nI agree in some ways. I've definitely learned the value
    of typography and it's being taught at my school (two levels before graduating),
    but just don't think I've been taught it thoroughly enough. I've had some great
    teachers and picked up a lot from their crits of mine and other students' work
    but they don't teach you fundamentals before sending you off to start working.
    Everything is just too based on crits and not enough on teachers doing their own
    presentations. There are some that will argue that you can learn the basics in
    a tutorial or in a book but then why am I paying all that money to go to school?
    \r\n\r\nI looked at Proxima Nova because I was looking up what fonts are the easiest
    to read (since I'll have a version of my portfolio that is a PDF) and read an
    article that said it was one of the easiest. Gotham was just an instinctive choice.
    Alright Sans is a good suggestion! Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is actually what bothers me about the education system in most countries. Most
    of the things I know I came to know because I studied it myself. School provides
    an environment where you're being pushed to learn new things but I expect the
    teachers to present a lot more information than they do. Particularly typography
    is undervalued I think. This is partially evident by the fact that I know a lot
    more about typography than most of my teachers. I've had basic typography classes
    but I taught about 95% myself. I think I would much rather be someone's apprentice
    like the olden days and really specialise in something rather than the current
    educational system.\r\n\r\nA few more suggestions: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/corbert/|Corbert]],
