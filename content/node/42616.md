body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI'm working on some self-promotional print ads for an interactive
  agency. Their corporate typeface is Trade Gothic Extended (bold for their word-mark,
  headings, etc., and regular for shorter text). After a while, all Trade Gothic Extended
  starts to look boring.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations for a complimentary serif face,
  that could be a good contrast to their  corporate face (maybe as heading, or body
  copy?)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAndrew"

    What is their tone? What sort of work do they do? Who are their clients?

    for pharmaceutical companies. They want to be perceived as \"sophisticated and
