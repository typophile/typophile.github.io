  is selling a large number of Hallmark's HMK fonts - at $29.99 each. Dozens of these
  fonts are included with each of Hallmark's Greeting Card programs - which retail
  at about $25! A small example - Hallmark's Card Studio 2011 sells for $25 and includes
  20 HMK fonts. Purchasing those fonts from Ascender would cost $600, and you wouldn't
  even get the card-making application.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    are designed by extremely knowing professionals, I am sure Zapf is among the luminaries.
    There is not a speck of junk among anything the could possibly offer.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    the fonts off the Ascender website, you are free to use the font for (virtually)
    any project in any application.\r\n\r\nGetting the fonts with the card-making
    app allows using the fonts in the card-making app only. (I am sure you can read
    that in the EULA) \r\n"

  body: "OK went to see the fonts, just be judicious with what you buy :-)\r\n\r\nZapf
    was a catalyst at Hallmark form the late 60's on. His work informed much that
    was done there. Some of these fonts are less informed than others. This is as
    a result of their foray into the casual card market.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    use is allowed, and one isn''t permitted to make any use of the resources outside
    the program.'

  body: "@HVB - Hallmark has an amazing library of proprietary fonts they created
    over the years for their use in greeting cards and other products they develop.
    And as you pointed out, they did in fact license a small set of fonts for use
    with a Hallmark greeting card software application targeted at consumers and home
    users.\r\n\r\nIt has been an honor for us to have partnered with Hallmark to bring
    a selection of these fonts to market at [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/foundry/hallmark/|AscenderFonts]]
    (and also at [[http://wwww.Fonts.com|Fonts.com]] and [[http://wwww.Linotype.com|Linotype.com]]).\r\n\r\nAs
    pointed out, one of the significant differences is that these new commercial versions
    of the Hallmark fonts are sold with a traditional commercial font license that
    designers typically expect. \r\n\r\nAnother key difference is that the talented
    type designers at Hallmark extended the character sets to full Latin 1 (codepage
    1252), and produced both TrueType and OpenType (.otf) versions.\r\n\r\nThus, these
    new versions of the Hallmark fonts are much more suitable to creative professionals.
    And as to the \"ridiculous pricing\", I would counter that these new commercial
    versions are a bargain when you consider the effort that went in to crafting them,
    along with their range of creative and expressive personalities."

  body: "Thank you all for the clarification. - I wasn't aware of the differences
    in the EULA, which certainly explains the significant cost difference.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I described the pricing as 'ridiculous', it was regarding the large differential
    between the separate retail price (which is the same directly from Hallmark) and
    the packaged price. It was not a comment on the quality of the fonts.\r\n\r\n-
