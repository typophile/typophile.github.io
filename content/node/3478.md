    target="_blank"> Century</a> face. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=century"
    target="_blank"> But which one?</a> I don&#39;t  <BR>understand the serif on the

  body: Exactly. The first one looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/century-schoolbook"
    target="_blank">Century Schoolbook</a>, whereas the second sample you posted is
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino" target="_blank">Palatino</a>.
