    based on late 1920s Beaux Arts capital letters hand-painted on the walls of Grand
    Central Station in New York City. This style of letter originated with the French
    Oldstyle letters by Louis Perrin in Lyons in 1846. In Europe it is Elzevir and
    in the U.S. it was De Vinne -- different from the digital font that now uses the
    De Vinne name.\r\nPrevious Braux Arts fonts thread http://typophile.com/node/44559

    derives from the architectural style of the same name. In the US, notable buildings
    in the style include Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library in
    NYC and Union Stations in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. In the UK, you have Selfridge\u2019s
    and 14 Prince's Gate in London and Barrow-in-Furness Main Public Library, to name
    a few.\r\n\r\nIf I had to describe the typographic style, I\u2019d say it references
    classical models (Roman stone inscriptions), but experiments with proportions
    and decorative elements, much like the architecture.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll want to
    focus your search on typefaces designed between 1880 and 1920, or revivals of
    type from that era.\r\n\r\nA  beaux-arts revival typeface and similar typefaces:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GrandCentral/\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?similar=Grand+Central&q=Go\r\n\r\nSome
