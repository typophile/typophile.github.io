  body: "I'm not sure about this one, although in general I'm a huge fan of Jeremy's
    work and think he is consistently interesting and creative in how he thinks about
    letters. I understand what he is doing in Fenland, but it seems to be unevenly
    successful: some letters look great as a result of the system he has applied,
    but others seem to me awkward; some look like novel constructions of real strength
    while others look like distressed letters (in part, I suspect, because they end
    up reminiscent of postmodernist experiments of the 1990s; this is especially the
    case with B D E). The construction of the N  obliges this to become a very wide
    letter: the first thing that jumped out at me about the design.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I think the lowercase is more successful than the caps, with which they don't
    seem to combine very naturally. I can't help feeling that the lowercase would
    work better alongside more 'normal' caps that don't draw so much stylistic attention
    to themselves. Or maybe the family would benefit from a distinction between display
    caps and text caps.\r\n\r\nLowercase v w x y seem to me awkward and, like the
    caps, not entirely in keeping with the rest of the lowercase. They give the appearance
    of needing to be strangely constructed in order to fit with the programme, instead
    of having a shape that balances well with the other letters. The thought I'm left
    with is that systematic programmes of 'norm violation'\u2014to use Peter Enneson's
    phrase in a situation in which I think it is particularly useful\u2014need to
    be flexible when applied to letters whose inherited construction is itself outside
    of the norms of the rest of the alphabet."

    seems way too busy and lively. Or is this more readable than plain vanilla Garamond

    letterforms whose edge-to-edge relationships are other than those derived from
    writing tools, and are trying to do so in systematic ways that apply across entire
    typefaces. I don't think all the results are awesome, but I appreciate the thoughtful
    approach to this question in type design, and I think the results tell us important
    things even when, as in the case of Fenland, I don't personally think the results
    are wholly successful. Fenland seems to me to demonstrate the limits of systematic
    programmes\u2014or at least of this systematic programme\u2014, particularly with
    regard to certain letters. Among other thoughts, this is going to send me back
    to look at Legato to examine more closely how Evert adapted his own systematic
    approach to the letters comprised of diagonal strokes.\r\n\r\nI also think it
    is awesome, in the full sense of the word, that Hrant and Nick agree about something."

    though it's apparent divorce from conventional structure, still has a strong chirographic
    affinity. The ductual logic is just reversed.\r\n\r\n<img src=http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/2/9/3262384/no.jpg
    width=\"500\" height=\"316\">\r\n\r\nThere are places where the designer deviates
    from this system, as can be seen in the circled area, at joints. Certainly, this
    is consciously designed to avoid black spots, and for that: \"chapeau!\".\r\n\r\nWhat
    bothers me is that, on the other hand, there are letters that seem not to follow
    any system at all (e.g. /t/, /N/), which was John's point. This is why I personally
    don't regard this as a very successful design, and also why I doubt Jeremy was
    concerned with notan (at all) as Evert was when designing Legato. What I like
    is what also John has already expressed best: I look at Fenland as an eye-opening
    way of thinking; inciting designers to assent to other kind of shapes different
    from those derived from the humanist hand. \r\n\r\n"

    \ \r\n(And, \u201CThe visual uniqueness of Fenland becomes apparent when it is
    seen at large sizes\u201D.)\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s all that can be said, other than
    post facto rationizations.\r\nI would imagine that he began with a vague idea
    of how an effect might be applied, in design and style, to the alphabet, according
    to the concept of divergent outlines, and then worked out what that would look
    like by a proceess of glyph-drawing. Trial and error, adapting each individual
    glyph to theme and sub-theme en masse, and redefining the themes too, in feedback
    loops. The hands-on practicality of a looping process that involves so much drawing
    would see to it that any \u201Csystem\u201D that emerged would have its inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nBut
    why put so much store on systemic consistency? Beyond the initial concept, type

    bit to be fair.  \r\nI am really rooting for Jeremy on this one! \r\nAt the moment,
    the counterforms seem to need to be pushed more in opposition to the norm to solidify
    the vision that this is a purposive departure.  I am sure Jeremy will get [and
    has gotten] plenty of notes of caution and requests to keep closer to traditional
    models. I hope he ignores all of it and follows his own vision.\r\nHe mentions
    abandoning pen based forms as a starting point. This is a good way to try to see
    the pure form without diluting it with tradition. That does not mean that I think
    \"THe Pen\" is wrong or even to be avoided.  It means to me that I prefer not
    to either reject totally or embrace totally any means.  To me, it means letting
    go of preconditioned axioms and having a visual dialogue with the forms in front
    of you and letting them each speak their own form of diction. Calligraphy has
    its own form of diction which has hundreds of years of evolution.  That does not
    mean it is either good or bad.  It is like the difference between French and German
    diction.  Neither one is wrong and neither one is right.  Each is a working system
    that differing peoples have arrived upon.  There is no need to stop looking for
    new diction as befits our current time.  The generations before us did not stop,
    nor should we.\r\nYou go Jeremy! Take your own Pinta, Ni\xF1a,and Santa Maria

    more conventional typefaces and more experimental ones. I just don't think that
    this one works very well. And it seems to me that difficulty of making more radical

    \ I have no problem with that.  Do what ever pleases you.  The problem I have
    is that those locked safely in the boundaries of past models of 'good' stuff should
    not ridicule those who choose to do things their own way.  If you want to sail
    your model boat safely in your bathtub, away from storms, currents, and reefs,
    fine. If that does not give you a superiority complex over those who venture further,
    fine. But do not point to the numerous safe voyages you have made across your
    bath tub as evidence of your superiority as a sailor of the real seas you fear
    too much to sail. How easy it is to align yourself with the historic masters you
    can safely emulate and thereby equate yourself with them.  Those historic masters
    whom you emulate were once the explorers of the high seas.  Years later, after
    the jury of hundreds of years of history has anointed them Masters, you are now
    safe to say, \"see, my stuff looks like theirs so it must be 'good' stuff.  No
    one is asking you to take the unknown voyage, certainly not those who do.  If
    your guilt of playing it safe controls you, then you have no choice but to heap
    ridicule on those who would take the risk. That way, you take the attention away
    from your own performance anxiety.\r\nNo one is saying that Fenland is the greatest
    success and should now be emulated by all the lemmings.  If you fear risk, do
    not mock those who take risk.  You need not even praise them, just let them do
    what they choose without blame."

    types, his concern in the sans being primarily with letter shape. Only a few have
    an irregular stroke, and in those it follows the nib ductus with correspondingly
    stressed contrast at a consistent angle, throughout the face. Contra Sans, thus,
    with a similar premise to Amira.\r\n\r\nFenland is calligraphically informed,
    but by being deliberately dis\uFB02uent in that respect, with both traditional
    \u201Cright-handed\u201D and \u201Cleft-handed\u201D (\uFB02ipped) stress (angle
    of contrast) exhibited in the same glyph. That\u2019s the difference. As a calligrapher,
    I can imagine/feel making Contra or Amira with a pen nib, the kind of manipulations
    it would require (and that\u2019s part of the pleasure of admiring those faces).
    But looking at Fenland I feel bewilderment at the difficulty of making its strokes.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    not a revolutionary idea, as JT admits with his bibliography, and as has been

    in a heartbeat. And considering this\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/harriet-series/#comment-69365\r\nI'm
    surprised Stephen didn't include Turnip. Maybe too much anti-chirography would

    3 faces of 2012! You forget he\u2019s a Dwiggins fan, Hrant.\r\n\r\nThe column
    Neil mentions was all about mentioning some recent releases that we didn\u2019t
    have an opportunity to write about during the year for one reason or another."
