  the website was outsourced and created by another company 12-13 years ago. When
  I go to change the font, the text defaults back to something generic meaning I don't
  have the type face on my computer. If someone could identify the type face for me
  so that we can re-buy it, that would be great! The website is: www.teenfreeway.com,
  and it is the left menu bar. What the font was of no help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJendalen"
