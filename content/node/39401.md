body: 'Quite unexpectedly a fragment of our concert in Paris last year popped up on
  YouTube. As it was captured by an amateur cinematographist ;^), the sound isn''t
  too great, so the beginning doesn''t make too much sense. Hear (and see) us rock
  out on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0cBrcg1uxM">Elsewhere</a>. The original
  brief for the drum pattern was: <em>"Make it sound like a cross between a marching
  band and a runaway train"</em>. We usually play this one at the end of our set,
  because I''m pretty beat after that. :^P'
