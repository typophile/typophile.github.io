  family-of-four-fonts thing? My guess is that Vista is the same as XP in this respect?

  body: I'm looking more along the lines of authoring for the platform rather than
    actually using it. I didn't have anything against windows until I started using
    it. Now I can safely say that I won't want to use it for anything other than testing.

    and future GDI applications, there is no change.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\u2019s new Windows
    Presentation Foundation (WPF) handles font names in a completely new way, based
    on trying to shoehorn them into families that fit within the CSS spec\u2019s ideas
    of how family members can differ. WPF is an optional install with Vista, and will
    also be made available for XP. Applications that use WPF will get the new font
    menus.\r\n\r\nHere are the slides from my presentation on the topic, which was
    aimed at font developers rather than application developers: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/CSS%20&%20OT%2015.pdf\r\n\r\nIf
    it's not already up, I'm sure MS will have info on this posted soon.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Thanks for the informative reply. It looks like things are going to get even
    more complicated now W3C are involved. Do  you think W3Cs involvement will help
    in the long run? It seems at the minute we will end up with another set of names,
    rather than a single standard.

  body: "Actually, the W3C are not directly involved - this is just Microsoft trying
    to shoehorn existing fonts into the CSS spec.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the CSS
    spec's handling of fonts is badly broken, or at best it is suitable for font <em>substitution</em>
    to find a reasonable replacement from a different family when the actual font
    is not available. However, using it for font <em>specification</em> seems goofy
    to me.\r\n\r\nPlus, as you say, it is \"yet another set of names\" that is not
    cleanly related to any of the existing names. But on the plus side, it is a huge
    advance over where Windows is today, so I am tempted to stifle my complaints.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
