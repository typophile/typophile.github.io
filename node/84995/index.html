  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"> Hey Typophile 

I have been  fairly inactive for a while but we put our typographer shoes on a bit ago and have been dancing and  working on a  stencil font that would highlight the spaces in between.  
We  also realized that the space in between doesn't have a name.  Some have tried 'pylon', but that just didn't make sense.   We think " ma" works  as its that non western idea of the palpable  presence of the metaphysical; like the pause between two notes or the silence in the middle of a sentence for dramatic effect.  This concept is imbedded in many cultures, why not a font. 

Currently, we have only  developed the "Ma" Caps at present.  
We wold love to know what you think. 
Without further ado.

		<div class="commentbody">I actually like this concept. It could work really well for Display usage, when you want the viewer to look at it a bit longer before they figure out what it says. My only suggestion would be to make the serifs a little larger. I get the point of keeping them small, but I think you're running the risk of not being legible at all.

Keep going!</div>

But it looks like a lighter cut I've seen coming from Non-Format ... perhaps they got it from somewhere else.

		<div class="commentbody"> minerva, thanks for showing us Sensaway.  Its wonderful.  We were obviously  looking for something very light delicate airy with a lot of white space. 
 We have a lot of work to do yet  but this is incredibly encouraging. Our 5- 9 numbers are a bit heavy.

 I know we had discussions about this being  above 24 pt and not really usable at smaller sizes. We would  agree it looses its legibility at the smaller sizes.  We are also hoping to be just at that edge of legibility enough to  make you think about what you are looking  at rather than just ah yes, not quite david carson what is it but very close. 
Its one of the reasons behind using a Snellen Eye Chart as a type example.  

 Thank you  for the feedback so far. We will post updates as we make our modifications.  We are hoping for a curious and interesting ampersand... its always the glyph that makes us  excited about particular fonts.

We have been embarking on a new Farm produce  distribution venture and wanted to develop a unique elegant typeface to complement the venture in the form of a logo text /mark.  The logo  text and mark are evolving as well.  As  soon as we can share those we will. 

I am glad to finally have a bit to contribute.
