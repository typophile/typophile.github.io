  some text on the back flap that closes and seals the envelope. Does anyone know
  of a (inexpensive) printer that can so such a thing? I've done a lot of searching
  online, but have only come up with printers who print on the front. \r\n\r\nAny
  ideas are appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nRobert\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I recall once talking to a printer about this sort of project. They told
    me they could print on the flap. But, they'd have to open the envelope to print
    on the flap and the front at the same time. In doing so they'd have to charge
    me extra for the time it takes to manually babysit the press (as it would probably
    cause more problems) as well as having to order more envelopes to keep from having
    too many unders. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "i did this also; similar to what miss tiffany described they printed 4/0
    with the envelopes completely unfolded, folded after printing.\r\n\r\nthere was
    a slight increase in cost. unfortunately i worked thru a print broker and did
    not deal directly with the printer, who was far away. (i'm in new york, printer
    was in florida).\r\n\r\ni would not recommend that arrangement as it made on-press
    proofing impossible and we had to reprint once for color.\r\n(i convinced the
    vendor to absorb the cost but that's another story). \r\n\r\nbut it is possible
    as a 4/0  job."

  body: "I've also printed on the flaps of envelopes, and as Miss Tiffany says, somebody
    has to manually open each envelope before it goes through the press. (And then
    close each flap again for delivery.) It's okay for a small print run. Larger quantities
    can make people unhappy. \r\n\r\nIf it's a very large or very complicated print
    run, the printer can print on flat stock and have the envelopes die-cut and made
    after printing. "

  body: You're definitely best off printing flat, and having it converted into an
    envelop. It's more expensive, but the results will most likely look better. I
    once printed a large field of color on a folded envelope and the varying thickness
    on the back side (where the various flaps overlap) caused the color to print unevenly
    -- you could see the the impression of those thicker areas in the color field.

  body: There is a safe way. The envelope is printed on flat, then die-cutting and
    transformation onto a envelope. As for costs I don't know much, just that there
    are big manufacturers with good prices. I guess you can look for a envelope maker
    over the internet.

  body: "Yea, I'd have to say your best bet for that might be an online printer. They
    tend to do decent jobs and have competitive pricing.\r\n\r\nI'd have to agree,
    if price is not an issue, print flat at a local printer and then have it converted
    into an envelope. Otherwise do some research and make a lot of phone calls."
