body: Hello Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Just writing to tell you that things are moving along
  with Eason &#40;formerly <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22064.html?1075673055">Saint
  Nicolaus</a>&#41;. I&#39;ve made many modifications to the roman, completely redrawn
  the italic &#40;and am doing so again&#41;, and added titling and inline caps. Progress
  is being hampered by non-type work, but I am hoping to scrape together a useful
  opentype family sometime in 2005. I still have to rework the bold, based on the
  changes to the regular and flesh out the variations on the figures. Fonts are a
  black hole that you toss your time into, happily. Anyhow, here is a preview. All
  suggestions welcome. <BR> <BR>Oops, I just noticed the inline S. It looks odd because
  the outside line is defining the curve instead of the inside, like it does everywhere
  else. See the B for example. I&#39;ll post that fix shortly. <BR> <BR>R <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'I also want to show the ornaments. I&#39;ve broken them out into their components
    for a wealth of flexibility: mixing colors, screens, wallpaper patterns, making
    borders etc. You may recognize them from <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/discus.pl?pg=prev&amp;topic=29&amp;page=10777">this</a>
    post long ago. The tea box strikes again &#40;though I have to say they are much
    cleaner and easier to use now. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/65545.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s that revised S. Still some curve tweeking to do but
    much better! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/65546.gif"

  body: "Paul and all: Thanks for dragging this thread back up! Eason has been a long
    time in the making, and she's at least partly out the door. I'm currently finishing
    up the Open Type version with has extended language support, and many useful features.
    Since the previous posts i've revised the italics, added a bold italic (thanks
    for the push Nick), tab and osf across all weights, monospaced the ornaments and
    added another ornamet series, and reworked the smallcaps.\r\n\r\nI send a big
    thank you to the Typophile community for your help and encouragement on this and
    other projects. Also thank you to Peter Bruhn and the good people at Veer.\r\n\r\nI
    will post up some other samples here in a few days. Love them inline caps!\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: "It truly is a wonder to behold. When asked for my favourite font of the moment
    while I was being interviewed for TypeRadio at TypeCon2005 New York this summer,
    I simply blurted out: \"Eason\". With no time to think or rationalise, I suppose
    this is what I really felt in my heart.\r\n\r\n(I know, it wasn't released yet,
    but I had the privilege to review an advance copy for the Typographer.org booklet,
    so I did know what I was talking about.)"

  body: "I was updating my wiki and discovered this loose end ... a *few* days later
    here are more samples. I've put the final version next to the original posted
    in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/2349\">this thread</a> for comparrison.
    Eason is in yellow, St. Nicolaus in the white. It was rather embarassing to see
    myself calling Jenson's long S an \"unusual F ligature\" in the original post!
    At least I can quantify that I've come a short ways since then :-) Enjoy and thanks
    (Yves for you kind words).\r\n\r\nOh, and sorry for the wide image. A relic from
    typophile's neolithic past.\r\n\r\nRandy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eason_compare_3999.gif]"
