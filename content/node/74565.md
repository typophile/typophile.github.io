body: Since two of the Type Design courses listed in "Handpicked" have been cancelled
  due to lack of enrollment, it may be time for them to be removed from "Handpicked".
  Unless of course "Handpicked" has some other meaning here on Typophile.

  body: perhaps i was looking at the wrong thread. can you post the links to the threads
    in question here and i'll remove them, although they may still show up in the
    handpicked section if you haven't cleared your cache.
