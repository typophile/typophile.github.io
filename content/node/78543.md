  body: Looks like ITC Avant Garde (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/).
    Not sure if the slanted uppercase 'A' is a glyph in the typeface or if it's modified
    from the 'AE' glyph.

    version</a> of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/itc_avant_garde_gothic_alternate/">ITC

  body: The slanted V and A makes me think that it is not Avant Garde but I am sure
    the glyphs are borrowed to make the unicase. I wish I knew the exact name of the
    unicase font though. Thanks for chiming in!
