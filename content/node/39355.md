  on it, specifically the numbers. I don't know if anyone on here skateboards, but
  the typeface is sort of inspired by a skateboard company called Krooked. Tell me
  what you think. \r\n\r\nAlso, this typeface so far has been made entirely in Illustrator,
  and i have no idea how to turn it into an actual font. Does anyone have any links
  or info i could read up on how to combine my characters in Illustrator into a font?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\njosh\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/guccipingpong/typeface.jpg[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_5316.jpg]"

    \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/potato-cut/potato-cut/\r\n\r\nSome
    characters are thicker than others. C M N T U V A \r\n\r\nSo in addition to evening
    the typographic color continue to refine your numerals. Then you'll have something
    really groovy.\r\n\r\nAll my best you,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "thanks for the critique Mike.\r\n\r\nMan, i swear i didn't look at that potato-cut
    typeface. I originally created about a third of the letters for a skateboard deck
    graphic, and decided that i might as well finish out the rest and turn it into
    a typeface."

  body: "Josh I know you didn't copy. Typophilers can tell if a font has been derived
    from another font and for sure its not the case with you. \r\n\r\nI just mentioned
    Potato Cut because if you plan on selling the font one day to the public or to
    a client you have to be aware of the possibility there maybe competing designs.
    That means you have to be extra special. Just looking out for you.\r\n\r\n:-)

    curves to other letters.\r\n\r\nIs the 'W' just a flipped 'M'? Maybe modify it
    so it doesn't look like it is.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Yeah, i see what you mean Mikey.\r\n\r\nI was feeling the same way about
    the 'C' Lex, i am gonna square it up more to fit with the other letters, and also
    modify the W and M so they aren't so similar.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone
    has any comment on the numbers. Do you think they look better a little bit more
    rounded like the 1-6 or blocky like the 8 and 9?\r\n\r\njosh"

  body: "Hi again:\r\n\r\nIf the alphabetics are rough and square then the numerals
    should be that way too. \r\n\r\nOr if you want to be smoother in the numerals
    you should bring that to the letters because it create harmony. \r\n\r\nUsers
    will mix letters and numbers together in the same world so all these characters
    have to jive together.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPS... CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ADDRESS

    and FontLab</a> are two, but there are others) and bring your Illustrator drawings
    into it. Check out the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12369?\">How-To</a>
    section of the TypoWiki for more info on the practical aspects. Check out the
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12157?\">Books</a> section to find literature
    on the subject of designing or creating a typeface. Also, a Google search will
    probably get you some online tutorials on the basics."

    rather too similar. Maybe the J could be re-thought."
