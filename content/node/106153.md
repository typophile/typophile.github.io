  Super low x-height/tall ascenders, looks art deco. Would seem like a normal geometric
  sans except for the occasional swirly terminal. Would this have been a font specific
  to the area, or would it have been imported (the type or even just the letterhead)
  from another country? Is this a specific typeface or perhaps it was modified or
  something to get the terminals? '

  body: I'm going to venture hand-drawn. As a thin, monoline geometric lettering style
    it's relatively straightforward to keep consistent with a ruler and compass. (Although
    it's still very skillfully done, not least the spacing!). What betrays it is the
    /S/es, none of which are alike.

  body: "The Prague letterhead is not in my standard references. So I explored some
    weak leads.\r\nJan Tschichold did decorative lettering in the early 1920s with
    some similarities to the Prague letterhead. This was the basis for <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/ironwork/\r\n/\">ITC
    Ironwork</a>, designed by Serge Pichii in 1997. The unknown font in your image
    has some similarities to ITC Ironwork. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITC_IronworkBEFHIJ_3482.jpg]\r\nSchelter
    & Giesecke produced  Tschichold fonts but I don't know if they had anything to
    do with the Prague letterhead font. \r\nAs for modifications, this was not done
    for metal type in the way we now do for digital fonts. However, typefaces were
    used as models for lettering and engraving. I note there is variation in some
    letters, such as S, so this seems like a probable explanation.\r\nA digital version
    is not impossible to create based on the information in your image. To assist
    in seeing the details I did a basic enhancement of it and rearranged the text
    to reduce horizontal sprawl: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownPrague1930sTypophile106153b_6667.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Definitely in the ballpark Nick. Top heavy monotone and good spirals.\r\nA
    few final thoughts.\r\nThis is engraving, not lettering or a typeface.\r\nSome
    of the effect can be replicated in Word and similar programs, except for the spirals
    by using medium [or lightweight] Neutraface Condensed with regular width letters
    substituted for C, D, G, J, M, N, O, Q, and X:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Prague1930sNeutrafaceCondRegBlend_4490.jpg]\r\nIf
    you edit the font, e.g. vertical flip of B, width adjustments etc, and add some
    spirals like those in Nick's Darling Emily, you would be very close to the original.\r\nDon"
