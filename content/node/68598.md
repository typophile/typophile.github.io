  in Fontographer 3.5 that we will need to be moved to Unicode, developed in Fontlab.
  We will likely need to have at least an English font and a Greek font.\r\n\r\nNot
  having time myself to learn what I feel I need to learn about Unicode to do this
  I'm wondering if anyone here would be interested in taking on the project and if
  a ball-park estimate can be given.\r\n\r\nI'd have to do some checking on this end
  before sending any files out as the fonts are actually owned by a publisher and
  are used exclusively by that publisher.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any info that can
  be offered.\r\nKen\r\n\r\nkenkrugh@tekntype.com"

    :-)\r\n\r\n<quote><em>We have 27 different fonts [...] We will likely need to
    have at least an English font and a Greek font.</em></quote>\r\n\r\nIs that 27
    different <em>styles</em>, or one \"normal\" font, with ligatures, Greek, and
    other characters spread over the other font files?\r\nThe good news is that you
    can probably move every glyph of your \"regular\" font into one single font file
    -- that's what Unicode is for. If you originally had four styles (Regular, Italic,
    Bold and Bold Italic), you'd end up with just four font files. All characters
    for Greek, for example, are encompassed in the Unicode set.\r\n\r\nThe principal
    idea of Unicode is really simple. It'd take some time to copy, then assign the
    correct Unicodes to every single character, and to copy all existing kern sets
    (and add new ones, as suddenly entirely new combinations are possible), but then
    you can add OT features for ligatures and stuff like that."

  body: "As Theunis says, you haven't really specified the extent of the work. If
    all your fonts currently have the same encoding (for example, if all the fonts
    with the Greek characters have them encoded the same), it would be fairly quick
    to do.\r\n\r\nThink of Unicode as an extension of ASCII -- that's what Unicode
    is, a standard, just like ASACII. Really big ASCII. Moreover, The first 127 characters
    in Unicode are the same as ASCII, the work amounts to giving the other characters
    the proper \"name\"; properly named, FontLab will assign the correct Unicode hex.
    One exception is the poloytonic Greek characters, where you'll have to look up
    the Unicode. Depending on what's in your fonts, there may be a few other characters
    in this class.\r\n\r\nBut likely you are undertaking this because you are switching
    layout programs, and the new, Unicode savvy programs allow for fonts with far
    more of the niceties programmed in. Some new glyphs will likely have to be drawn
    up, the \"extra\" ligatures such as ffi, ffl, ff, fj, maybe fb, fh, fk. Features
    for switching numbers, oldstyle and lining, in both tabular and proportional,
    will need to be written, and any missing glyphs created. As a rule of thumb, when
    converting our old PostScript Type 1 fonts to OpenType fonts,  I allow two days
    for the roman, one day for the italic. This from a starting point where most of
    the characters/glyphs were already made up, as our old layout program allowed
    custom encoding. The roman takes longer because of the nature of our work, so
    our \"new\" OpenType roman fonts have superscripts (for footnote calls), arbitrary
    fractions, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nIf this is an accurate picture of your situation,
    the work will take longer. I'd almost say you would be better off to do it yourself
    even given the learning curve of FontLab, as a significant part of the work is
    understanding what will be needed with *your* workflow. That's were your expertise
    overshadows the mostly mechanical problem of converting the fonts.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks very much for your input, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nTheunis is correct.
    We would likely end up with just four fonts, Roman, Italic, Bold and BoldItalic
    along with a few custom characters that aren't likely in the unicode set.\r\n\r\nCharles
    is also correct that we are working toward having everything in InDesign and it
    WOULD be in my best interest to have at least someone here in our operation know
    Unicode enough to create a solid font. Thanks for the specifics too, Charles.
    I hadn't given much thought to all the unicode features we could add, which of
    course will add more time!\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on a source of knowledge for
    a unicode newbee?\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks."

  body: "I should have followed your bio to your web page.\r\n\r\nIf these are Matthew
    Carter's fonts for Yale, I'd be willing to do the work, out of affection for Carter
    and YUP. If you want to check my <cite>bona fides</cite>, ask Carter and Chris
    Coffin at YUP. If the project isn't the Yale fonts, I wouldn't touch it.\r\n\r\nI'd
    note that what you need done is not to create a \"Unicode\" font, but an OpenType
    font from the various PS Type 1 sources. OpenType presupposed Unicode, but not
    the inverse. The OpenType spec could become obsolete; in all likelihood whatever
    replaced it would also conform to Unicode.\r\n\r\nFrom the basic Unicode perspective
    -- the character compliment -- the first thing you have to establish with your
    client is what languages they want to support. This goes beyond simply \"Latin\"
    or \"Greek.\" There are numerous languages that essentially use the Latin alphabet
    -- several African languages, Native American languages, Vietnamese, etc. -- that
    use a few extra characters (provided for in Unicode), either directly or with
    combining diacriticals. Your client may also wish to provide for Latin transliterations
    of, say, Arabic, the Indic Scripts, Chinese, Japanese, etc. These too require
    characters with combining diacriticals.\r\n\r\nMoving from the characters, you
    need to provide the OpenType features that will make composition possible with
    InDesign (or another OpenType-based layout program). This is where it can get
    complicated. \r\n\r\nTo give you just one example, we recently got in a manuscript
    where all the accents in the author's files were accomplished by using combining
    diacriticals, even the common European accented characters. Speaking precisely,
    *combining diacriticals* would not be in the Type 1 font, so the Unicode portion
    of the font work would require creating them. Beyond this, an OpenType feature
    would need to be written to make their use seamless. This could be done with a
    ccmp feature, or mark and mkmk features. By the way, the current version of FontLab
    Studio 5 does not support mark and mkmk, so if you stick to FontLab, you would
    have to use ccmp. If you wanted to use mark and mkmk, you would need to use the
    Adobe tool. Each method has pluses and minuses, and each has its advocates.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    do you intend to support these fonts for your client? In our bookwork, we don't
    do much composition with format design, but we do set a number of academic journals,
    so I'm familiar with the issues of \"templates.\" As I'm sure you know, it is
    just a matter of time before some author comes up with something that will require
    a little more fontwork. If you are going to support the fonts, you are best served
    to write the OT features in a way that will let you go back into the file and
    add either characters or new features, as needed. This is an issue the font designers
    don't often face. The trick is to write the feature code so it might be a little
    less compact, but is more user friendly.\r\n\r\nI know of no single book that
    covers all this, you just need to comes to terms with both the Unicode Standard,
    and the OpenType Standard."
