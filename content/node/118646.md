  package. However, looking at offerings form different foundries, prices seem to
  differ quite drastically, e.g., Adobe wants 350,00 \u20AC while FontShop only charges
  233 \u20AC.\r\n\r\nSo, what's the reason for such huge differences? Is it just competition
  or are there actual differences in the font quality/version/features? Or might it
  be due to different licensing conditions?\r\n\r\nI hope someone can shed some light
  on this, since I really would not like to spend such money on a lower quality font
  or something like that...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nHans\r\n"

  body: Minion is an Adobe Original, so it would be the same font on both sites AFAIK.
    I'll tweet Adobe Type and see if anyone responds.

  body: "It probably has to do firstly with conversion rates applied between $ (Adobe
    being american, etc.) and \u20AC, and tax calculation (for me, for example, FontShop
    price becomes \u20AC 284,26 after taxes)."

    body: "The 350 \u20AC Adobe price and the 233 \u20AC Fonts.com/FontShop/Linotype
      price is both excluding taxes, so this should not be the reason. I don't know
      how much of an issue currency conversion is, but this still seems like a rather
      large difference to me.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It looks like Adobe is applying the same premium price increase to european
    customers as they historically do for their software: the same fonts retails for
    just $299\u2026\r\nIf for software programs the price increase could be justified
    by localisation costs, it looks completely arbitrary on fonts.\r\n"

  body: "For whatever it's worth, it should be the same fonts in both cases. FontShop
    gets its Adobe fonts through Monotype, and Adobe has supplied Monotype with the
    latest versions. (There was some delay on Monotype's end in shipping them, but
    with any luck they are now.)\r\nThe only difference should be in the license.
    Adobe has one of the more permissive licenses in the business, allowing commercial
    use, embedding for e-books & Flash, and modifications for private use - none of
    which are covered by Monotype's EULA. Neither EULA covers web font use.\r\nGood
    luck!"
