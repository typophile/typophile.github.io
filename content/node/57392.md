body: "Im working casually on this logo.  ( casually  in very discounted rates because
  family / friend etc ) \r\n\r\nIm thinking about helping further with this by finding
  a suitable typeface to define the Branding with. ( am i too nice? )\r\n\r\nSomething
  light and friendly. Gills Sans ( MT version used in logo ) and Myriad Pro are hight
  on my list right now.\r\n\r\nIm wondering if any typophiles might school me on these
  choices and/or  care to share feedback on the logo and use of cc spills.\r\n\r\ncheers
  people!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Gill Sans is a great typeface, I'd go with that. It's even part of the logo.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking for something a bit more unique, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/dederon-sans/|Dederon
    Sans]] is also nice and friendly, and he/she can even purchase the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/dederon-serif/|serif
    version]] to go with it."
