  body: Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press generally specify the
    name of the font type and size in the Copyright page. However, I prefere in the
    Colophon.

  body: geraint <BR> <BR>Try reading the ending of the book first. Often more interesting.
    But no, not an American thing. <BR> <BR>Colophons first appeared in printed books
    shortly after the development of printing with movable type. So they would be
    mid-European and mid fifteenth century in origin. <BR> <BR>They refer to the production
    details and other aspects of the book, not just the typeface. During the period
    of Incunabula &#40;1455-1500&#41;, colophons rarely actually discussed typefaces
    &#40;called &#34;letters,&#34; by the way, not &#34;type,&#34; up until about
    1700&#41; since castings were usually unique to the printer. <BR> <BR>Colophons
    mostly appear in fine press books &#40;where they are seemingly a requirement&#41;
    and high-end trade books &#40;where they are seemingly an affectation&#41;.

  body: '&#62;seemingly an affectation <BR> <BR>I believe that the Penguin books always
    used to note the typeface on their copyright page; this was I suspect a guideline
    laid down by Tschichold when he was art director for them. I don&#39;t know what
    they do now.  <BR> <BR>Since it doesn&#39;t take any more pages or cost, I think
    this is a nice grace note - it acknowledges the physical production that goes
    into a book.  <BR> <BR>I would like to see also the book designer&#39;s name,
    which is unusual, though crediting the book cover designer seems to be the rule.
    Does anyone know why this disparity?'

  body: <i>Who chooses the fonts and does the layout if not a designer?</i> <BR> <BR>Well,
    I just laid out a book, and I can assure you I <b>did not choose</b> Times New
    Roman for it! Nonetheless the book is set in Times.  <BR> <BR>I was indeed the
    compositor, but I was implementing someone else&#39;s design for this book.

  body: I see that AIGA presents <a href="http://aiga.org/content.cfm/5050_2004" target="_blank">yearly
    awards</a> for both books and book covers, so evidently designing the insides
    of books is still partly done by designers. Who else does it? What proportion
    of books are designed by professional designers? How does the industry work? Is
    it different in different countries?

  body: I&#39;ve noticed that children&#39;s books &#40;meaning books written for
    children, of course&#41; credit a book designer more often than boring grown up
    books. It could have something to do with doing the type layout around illustrations.
