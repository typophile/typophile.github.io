  body: "It resembles several fonts, including <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/vendome/\">Vendome</a>,
    but it may be a serif that has been customized by adding triangular serifs. The
    first font I thought of as looking like this was Matrix from Emigre, but the R
    is wrong. I think a lot of regular serifs would look like Matrix if they had their
    serifs covered by triangles. I searched for Latin Serif, but I think if there
    are other places where they use the same font (I'm not about to explore this site),
    maybe you should ignore the serif shape and use the Serif Font ID Guide to see
    if you can identify what they started from. The upper serif on the G seems like
    it was not modified and that might be a way to find the base font that was used
    (if my theory is right).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
