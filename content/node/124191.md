  (not a single line), in a similar way to the attached Liechtenstein logotype. \r\nThe
  circles/shapes should follow the shape of the circular letters, see letter 'C'  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/liechtenstein_brand_story-011

  body: "This brand was designed for The Principality of Liechtenstein by by Wollf
    Olins. It includes a crown [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LiechstensteinWithCrown_5189.png]

    The flower represents the agrarian roots of the Principality, the intermediate

  body: "\r\nThanks Don. I realize Wolf Olins did this, just trying to find a similar
    font. Most 'dot' typeface are just a dot patterns dropped in the the letter shape
    (as above). What I am looking for is a typeface where the dots actually create
    the shape, don't just fill it. On the 'C' and 'S' above the shapes follows the
    contour of the letters.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, appreciate it."

    etc follow the shape rather than merely fill it. At least I did not find any.
    It would be a good project for an intrepid font maker.\r\nDon"

    your best bet to achieve the result is to take an \u201Cengraving\u201D font (either
