  focuses on custom birthday invitations, birth announcements, holiday greetings,
  etc. The main theme behind the company is to celebrate the little things in your
  big life. The central theme of the product is based on family events. \r\n\r\nThe
  target audience is mother's, ages 25-42, mid-high income bracket. She probably enjoys
  reading Cookie magazine and taking Starbucks coffee breaks.\r\n\r\nThe logo is intended
  to be fun, approachable, and representative of the look and feel of the products
  the company is selling.\r\n\r\nI got so much great feedback with my last logo posting,
  I hope to get the same amount of critique and debate with this one. This forum is
  great. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lbl_4985.jpg]"

    However I do agree with robbie, Gotham contrasts well but it might be a little
    too static. Its a good choice but I think it needs to feel BIGGER, maybe something
    as simple as shearing it at an angle in order to give it some depth. Nice work
    tho. -ONE"

  body: While I do like it I wonder if "little" and "life" be a touch smaller and
    rotated (differently) to have a little more bounce? The silhouette isn't rigid
    so the type doesn't need to be either. You could even have a tiny bit of overlap.

    look).\r\n\r\n-S"

  body: "I agree with Tiffany too! It needs a touch of asymmetry with the text treatment.
    Have a play with a small 'little' and a huge 'big' - an overlap may work well.
    Give it a sense of drama.\r\n\r\nI HATE the Gotham. Try something more modern
    with personality, less classic. Each letter of the word 'big' could be asymmetrical
    too...might be too much but worth exploring.\r\n\r\nI also think the blue could
    be a touch brighter. White text with pink offset/hard drop shadow (1950s/60s style)
    on a stronger blue arrow? Might be worth looking at getting both pink and blue
    in there with the family theme.\r\n\r\nJust some ideas but i think you are on
    the right track."

    looking for something 'plain' to pair with a face that has some personality to

    and when is it bad?\r\n\r\nAs for National -- I really like the font overall.
    I adore the LC letters but the UC letters (particularly the B-I-G together) don't
    seem interesting enough for me to use it in this logo. I think it would be great
    for a brochure job I'm working on, though. I love the depth of the family."
