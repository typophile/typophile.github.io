		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Chris and Joe.  <BR> <BR>Yes, I've heard this before. And I know it (and more) to be true.  <BR> <BR>I'm a past design studio Principal/Owner (of 16 years), and a past Design Instructor too; 20 years of national industry experience in total. But learning is, of course, continual. <BR>  <BR>What it's funnelled down to though, is that it is proven I'm dealing (largely) with people's (small town = small mind) perceived fear. So that's what I'm having to deal with. It's not easy. Only the courageous and curious ask questions.  <BR> <BR>But they eventually always prove to hire someone (and we're talking here about a full-time senior-level design position on staff ) who is &quot;younger, cheaper, and mouldable.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Call it unwise management. Call it short-sighted thinking. Call it poor business. (All of the above are true.) Call it whatever you like or perceive yourself. But the fact is, I need full-time work. And I can't seem to get it. It's been a long time now. And I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. Any help is graciously appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">oohay, <BR> <BR>Speaking from direct experience, I recently interviewed a  <BR>designer who owned his own firm and was used to running the  <BR>show. Needless to say it was scary for me to even consider  <BR>having him come in. I wondered if he'd want to run MY show, or  <BR>if he'd have too strong of ideas about how projects should be run. <BR> <BR>I can see how people interviewing you could be intimidated. <BR> <BR>He totally put me at ease by saying he wanted to learn from our  <BR>process and was eager to collaborate with other designers -  <BR>whereas he'd been used to flying solo. This didn't undermine <BR>his experience, but communicated that he's flexible and, as you  <BR>say, always learning. <BR> <BR>Best of luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the very useful and helpful words, Joe.  <BR> <BR>Yes, I've tried this. And I do communicate what you describe, right in my cover letter. Some (the real fearful ones) don't seem to &quot;buy it.&quot; (Their fear is more powerful?) Others try to (and I can see this), then reneg. I've even had several false alarms (jobs offered), which I think were also due to this. Totally unprofessional indeed. <BR>  <BR>What I realize, of course, is that I myself cannot control someone elses fear, or chosen perception(s).  <BR> <BR>So I just try to do my best. But I've been doing &quot;my best&quot; for far too long now, and literally struggling to survive, when I shouldn't be. In fact, far from it. I never thought I'd be in this life, or career position. Ever. <BR> <BR>And yes, what Hrant also indicates, has also come through from other employers.</div>

Yes, when asked by serious potential employers&hellip;I do confidentially address (both personally and pro) why I ultimately chose to &quot;give up&quot; my firm. Not all ask though. Only the daring.

And no professional can (or will) do work for that grossly cheap. People also don't hire freelancers online&hellip;they definitely don't here. Also, I've past freelanced, done contract, and even subcontract work for many years. I'm beyond that now. Somewhere else. Sorry if unclear?

Further, I have applied for, and do apply for, b) positions which are below my level of capabilities. (If you have read the posts, I believe you will also see reference made to this.) Regardless, I have no need, inclination or desire to be defensive, or get involved in what reads to be an attack (for some unknown reason.)  <BR> <BR>Thank you for your input Stuart, but from here on, I think I may have to refrain from responding to you or addressing your flagrantly negative, unconstructive, demeaning, disrespectful, and off-topic commentary&hellip;and attacks&hellip;to what is (and I certainly hope comes across as) bare nakedly honest, humble, and honorable words, from an experienced professional and instructor, that I have chosen to share here (however annonymously; but is it &quot;safe&quot; here??), where I haven't anywhere else (for obvious reasons.)

		<div class="commentbody">Stuart, <BR> <BR>While I have little time (I'm job hunting, if you recall) or inclination to get into long, drawn out conversations, explanations and rationalizations (why would I? I simply don't have need to&hellip;) about fairly straight forward arenas and professional issues, that most experienced designers would know, I did want to respond in brief to your post. <BR> <BR>First off, you indicate &quot;nor am I familar with your position. . .&quot;, so perhaps it may be difficult for you to actually understand, and/or understand the position someone such as myself is in, and after so many years in the industry.  <BR> <BR>Secondly, there was no &quot;playful tone&quot; read or noted in any of your written coorespondence. Clearly this failed to come across, if indeed it was so. Further, there is more attitude noted in this passage, which is totally inappropriate and highly undeserved. Again, I can't allow time for this. It's just hard and painful enough as it is, if you know and can fathom what I mean. <BR> <BR>Third, you indicate that &quot;It's not for me to judge you or your situation&quot;, and yet it is clear from your words, tone and attitude deliverred, that you have unfortunately done exactly that. Perhaps consider reading your words again. You can't really blame someone else, for your own deliveries.  <BR> <BR>Fourth, not once was I found &quot;refuting any suggestions offered&quot;. What I disliked, naturally, was/is being treated poorly on this discussion board. It is unacceptable, of course. Just as it would be for you, I would imagine. Yet further, your posts have been a horrific, cruel and inhuman (let alone unprofessional) way to talk to and treat someone, further when I had already previously outlined my (sad) position. I find *that* more sad. You have unfortunately made this board and unwelcome and unsafe place. <BR> <BR>Fifth, regarding another presumption forwarded, I am  hardly &quot;running all over town with your resume and your book trying to get hired and nothing else&quot;, nor have I indicated such practices previously. It's also not how I operate, nor do any experienced professionals that I know and am aware of, across the country. It's simply not how it's done in the industry (here in Canada at least), which I can only imagine would be known to yourself, if you are an experienced designer yourself. I believe this was also highlighted and shared in previous posts above. <BR> <BR>Sixth; pretty much any design professional knows the reputation and basically unethical nature of E-lance and the like. Frankly, I'm not even interested to discuss it, don't have the time, nor inclination, as indicated. This is also not the topic at hand. Feel free to discuss it amongst yourselves if you like (another thread perhaps?) It's a dead issue. No one in the professional industry here, or anyone that I know of in the industry across Canada, that is, NO ONE, uses E-lance. It's not even considered professional design. <BR> <BR>In case it's unclear, I am having to focus all my time and energies on acquiring a full-time on-staff design position, because that is what I need. So really, I must get back to that now.  <BR> <BR>I hope this satisfies your present interest?? and need for more specifics regarding my situation. <BR> <BR>Onwards now&hellip;and back to the job hunt here. I'm off for the day, at least, and perhaps permanently.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As an added note, perhaps from the Instructor side of me, as well as business owner, and definitely from experience; &hellip;similar Joe had said in agreement himself: <BR> <BR>&quot;E-lance, indeed. That's another topic. Being the cheapest (lowest bidder) is never a way to differentiate because someone can always do it for less.&quot; <BR> <BR>Lowering design, industry, or business costs, standards and ethics is never a way to get noticed, differentiate, or to get work. We get known for what we do. You not only shoot yourself in the foot, but you shoot your fellow designer/peers in the foot, and you shoot the client in the foot, by misrepresenting the industry, and miseducating the client about who designers are, and what we do; and you perpetuate poor practices of design and business. Read; the business of design. And it has long term residual affect. This is what the AIGA and GDC are all about, improving the perception and understanding in the marketplace of what design is, and what it can do. <BR> <BR>We are all responsible for our part, however big or small. (Remember folks, I teach this stuff.) When you rest your head on your pillow at night, do you feel good about what you do? And how you do it? And how you operate in the business of design? (whether you're running a business, freelancing, or on staff.) I do. And I can do that. And I always have. It's also why clients came to my firm.  <BR> <BR>It's called integrity. <BR> <BR>Besides, no one can do work, let alone quality work, and survive, for the &quot;lowballing&quot; and undercutting that is the foundation of E-lance and the like. And professionals simply don't partake. But that is just common-knowledge. <BR> <BR>Caio now. I'm off.</div>

And no, none of you are aware of that, nor do you have to be. <BR> <BR>I asked for advice, yes, and hoped to be treated with respect and dignity&hellip;and professionalism.

I'm interested in more mature, professional and constructive exchange and pursuits. I've moved on now. Time is of the essence.  <BR> <BR>Thank you to those of you who did share well-meaning thoughts and advice, in a positive, kind and respectful way.  <BR> <BR>Best of luck folks.</div>

Either only hang out with people just like you, or fix it. <BR> <BR>* Mostly because you've been too insecure to use your real name! <BR> <BR>BTW, I've seen your sort of repeated fake-nice goodbye a hundred times: it's just an attempt at getting the last word. Well you want some advice? Here it goes: it doesn't friggin' matter how many times you deliver sugar-coated goodbyes and claim to leave; since you can't really leave (because you were never really here) know that the only way you can have the last word is &quot;internally&quot;, and only by no longer reading after you say bye.
