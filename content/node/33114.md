  have a lot of stuff going on in this one, and I don't want it to be confusing. \r\n\r\nI
  appreciate any feedback you folks have.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shootgoal_5307.jpg]"

    for my taste.\r\nNo reference to books and reading."

  body: "The first version definitely does have too much going on. I don't think it
    works.\r\n\r\nThe second version is better, but still looks too busy to me. I
    don't know if the \"Sh\" has to be connected to the \"oo\", or even if the \"oo\"
    needs to be connected to the swoosh.\r\n\r\nI'd say simplify it. Pick one element
    that you think works best, and focus on that, whether it's the ball with the swoosh,
    or the goal, or something else.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Yeah, soccer and libraries aren't synonomous.\r\n\r\nLibrary directors theme
    their programs. They are inviting high school soccer players to read and talk
    about using libraries. They are including stuffed soccer balls with packets. I
    am to design the information packets.\r\n\r\nTime to tinker some more.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the feedback, gents."
