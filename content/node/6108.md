body: Can anybody help me to find fonts and corresponding sets of swashes that underline
  the lettering?  I&#39;ve found one free one called Marcelle &#40; <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=104&amp;page=2"
  target="_blank">http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=104&amp;page=2</a> &#41;,
  which works well, but I&#39;m looking for one that isn&#39;t faded like that.  Even
  just a set of underline swashes that would work with old Brush Script would be fantastic.  Thanks
  for the help.

  body: Those Pilsner swashes are pretty much exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but
    I&#39;d like to find a set of them that would correspond with Brush Script, and
    maybe one I didn&#39;t have to pay for.  Any suggestions?

    and everyone wins.

    border=0> Well said Marc. <BR> <BR>Frankly Matthew, I think your options are pretty
    clear-cut. If you  <BR>want a freeware font go for Team Spirit, if you don&#39;t
    mind paying  <BR>a bit for your fonts the other options are listed in the posts
    above. <BR>It&#39;s quite straightforward, really. '
