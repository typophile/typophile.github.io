body: "In my opinion typefaces like Warnock, Swift, Scala, Charter, TheSerif could
  be put in the same category to distinguish them from more traditional serif typefaces.
  They share similar features with slab-serifs (low contrast strokes and almost blocky
  serifs) but in use they share more common ground with other serifs. I feel like
  they\u2019re too unconventional to fit in the same class as old style and traditional
  humanist serifs. Maybe I\u2019m just looking for a good classifying name (not \u2039modern\u203A
  or \u2039contemporary\u203A serif) to lump them together. Just some thoughts from
  someone who\u2019s sorting out their font library and likes to put suitable labels
  on things (music that doesn\u2019t fit into a genre/subgenre also irks me when I\u2019m
  sorting playlists)."

    body: "Takk! Some interesting thoughts there \u2013 too many type classifications
      can get confusing and limiting. I suppose I\u2019m looking more for a common
      tag or description to use for these typefaces than I am proposing a re-classification
      of them."

  body: "Beklager: I didn\u2019t have time to answer more in depth earlier. Classifying
    type is hard, and gets increasingly harder. I think it makes a lot of sense to
    think in different layers, using a tagging system as Indra suggests: Structure,
    contrast, decoration, proportions etc. \r\n\r\nStructure-wise these all belong
    in the humanist genre, but they certainly have a more contemporary flair than
    Garamond (as you note). Kind of like how 50Cent is hip hop, but Digable Planets
    is even more hip hop.\r\n\r\nI think most typographers would consider the structure
    most essential: A fitting pair of typefaces would typically consist of a sans
    and a serif with the same structure/skeleton at heart: dynamic serif + dynamic
    sans, regardless of \u201Cdecoration\u201D like serif shape and contrast. But
    type design is moving, and many new designs skip the idea of a skeleton altogether,
    forcing also typography to reconsider its dogmas.\r\n\r\nSo, a common term? I
    suspect you\u2019ll have to wait a hundred years before we all agree."
