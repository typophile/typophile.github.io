  I promise :)\r\n\r\nI'm researching typefaces that contain the most beautiful 'numbers'
  and/or 'fractions' that you have come across? This maybe a technically very good
  typeface or typefaces, or just lovely on the eye. A tough question as I read that
  back to myself, but please post any links you have.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your
  replies...\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nRez x\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hey, typefaces are like pieces of art. It is at large a matter of taste! Personally
    I hate Helvetica, but millions of people seem to like it anyway. Who's right me
    or them? I'd say none! ;-)
