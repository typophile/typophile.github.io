body: "Hi there, comparing the two digital versions of Bell - the first taken from
  Monotype revival and currently available via Adobe/Linoptype/Monotype etc., the
  latter from the URW library - it stroke me how many differences there are. URW version
  seems much more gentler and delicate than Monotype's. And the lowercase A seems
  a completely different letter - I love URW's version, by the way. It would be interesting
  to know on which historical sources those versions were based.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bell_a_4152.jpg]"

  body: "This seems to be the answer. For the metal type they called \u2018Bell\u2019
    Monotype were working from types that had been newly cast by Stephenson Blake
    from original matrices that were made from punches cut by Richard Austin for the
    foundry of John Bell in the 1780s. They were used by the University Press at Cambridge
    in 1930 to print Stanley Morison\u2019s monograph on John Bell. Their text size
    seems to be based on the original \u2018English\u2019 (about 14 point) type, which
    they scaled down to make the smaller sizes. (For the 8 point the descenders were
    greatly reduced, but the design does not seem to have been radically redrawn.)
    This is the \u2018English\u2019:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Austin-Bell
    English det 500_3414.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor 18 point and above (the metal type was cut
    in sizes up to 36 point) Monotype\u2019s model was a larger type, the \u2018Great
    Primer\u2019 cut by Austin. This has greater contrast in the capitals and a flat
    foot to letter a.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Austin-Bell DP det
    500_5801.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor making their digital types URW\u2019s model seems to
    have been Monotype\u2019s smaller sizes, whereas for their own digital \u2018Bell\u2019
    Monotype appears to have used a single model, their 18-point cut for metal. \r\n\r\nThe
    metal type of 1931 had been excellently made, since by then Monotype were past
    masters in adapting historical models to the demands of machine setting. Their
    Caslon of 1915 was a good example of this, in which every single size was as near
    as possible a facsimile of the metal types (in which all the sizes were different)
    cast by the Caslon foundry. Their Series 146 of 1921, called \u2018Old Roman\u2019
    and later known by the US name \u2018Scotch Roman\u2019, was a similar \u2018near-facsimile\u2019,
    size by size, of the revived early-19th-century type (possibly also the work of
    Richard Austin) of the Edinburgh foundry Miller & Richard. These types have to
    be called \u2018near-facsimiles\u2019 since some characters neded to be slightly
    redrawn to fit the 18-unit system on which the Monotype line justification system
    depended, which sometimes meant stretching or compressing them slightly \u2013
    a compromise that was rarely mentioned at the time. \r\n\r\nAnother compromise
    on the part of Monotype in making their metal types was to tone down some of the
    more strongly-drawn constrasts in stroke thickness and sometimes to adjust the
    design too, making it \u2018smooth\u2019 (their term), as they had done in their
    Baskerville and Bembo types. This technique produced the excellent fitting and
    even overall colour for which the \u2018classic\u2019 Monotype faces were admired.
    Although the \u2018Bell\u2019 is more of a near-facsimile than these faces, the
    Great Primer may have lost a bit of its original strength of design which can
    be seen in the recast types for this size that I think are still kept at Cambridge.
    \r\n\r\nMaybe there is now room for a \u2018Bell\u2019 that follows the variations
    in design and proportion of some of the different sizes of the original type.\r\n"

    there is now room for a \u2018Bell\u2019 that follows the variations in design
    and proportion of some of the different sizes of the original type.\" \r\n\r\nAnd
    a better digital rendition for what Stanley Morison described as \"the greatest
    development in 'finish' since Aldus\" would be much appreciated. Bell's current
    digital version - nor Monotype's, neither Urw's - doesn't look satisfying; it's
    too weak on screen and paper. I believe that someone should give Bell the same
    re-design treatment that Matthew Carter did on \"Miller\" - with an eye to its
    rounded and delicate terminations and serifs, which, at least to me, makes it
    a bit different from the \"heavy\" shapes of the so called Modern - Scotch types;
    a type more in the tradition of the French Eighteen founders \xE0 la Fournier/Vafflard.\r\n\r\nAn
    effort based on the display size was recently made by Paul Barnes/Christian Schwartz;
    but it doesn't seem to be available:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.christianschwartz.com/austin.shtml\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, James, I'll be in Parma in October in your seminar about type)."

  body: "Thanks James, that's what I suspected.\r\nIt seems to me that there are three
    ways in which a metal type can change from size to size.\r\nThis is an illustration
    of Akzidenz Grotesk, from a 1954 specimen, with 20 pt (left) and 24 pt (right)
    scaled to the same cap height.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mers_4626.jpg]\r\n\r\n1.
    Letter structure: the angle of the \"e\" terminal is markedly different.\r\n2.
    Global proportion: the x-height is different.\r\n3. Vagary (unintentional inconsistency):
    the 24 pt \"s\" is too bold (not just an odd heavy impression, this occurs throughout
    the specimen). \r\n\r\nIt may well be impossible to decide whether certain inconsistencies
    between sizes are unintentional/mistakes, or not--perhaps things just turn out
    differently.\r\n\r\n(Apologies for deviating from Bell, but this is from a scan
    I happened to have at hand.)"
