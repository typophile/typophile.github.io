  body: "I think it is calligraphy,although it's too small a sample to be certain.
    Other alternatives: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/flemish-script/\">Flemish
    Script</a> and <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_anglia.html\">Anglia</a>,
    from Psy/Ops, which has a lot of variations with some similar flourish.\r\n\r\n-
