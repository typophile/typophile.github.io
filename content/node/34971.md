  body: The 'S' looks from a typeface with a very thick stroke added. Most of the
    other shapes look like they have been drawn costomly, or edits of stroked letters.

    don't think this is a font. The difference between the width of the characters
    makes it look more like a custom job.)"

    from Richard D Parker & Apostrophic Laboratories are close. That one is based
    on shapes from the Chinese Tangram puzzle. You have a similar shape as the M but
    it's a W in Textan. (<a href="http://www.creamundo.com/index.php?lang=en&letra=t&fuente=Textan+-+Square+TTF">See
