body: Hey guys. I'm looking for the font on the attachment, I did find it looks like
  pt sans bold italic but I'm not sure. If you know the name of the font can you please
  post it? Thanks in advance.

    logo work. If you need the 3 letters only, I suggest you to recreate them. You
    could start from any generic sans of your own simply reworking top left angles
    or redraw it from scratch as it is only made with strokes. Start upright, shear
    it to match you sample and round angles. That should be even quicker than waiting
    for someone to identify it.
