  body: "Well, the S has the weight in the wrong place--should usually thicken in
    the center. Check out other s's for <a href=\"http://www.typedesign.com/fonts/benmed.html\">examples</a>.
    Also, the top right curves on the m and n taper oddly. Curves should be thickest
    at the sides and thinnest at top, if you are going for a vertical stress--your
    zero has it right. In general the letters need to be more consistent with each
    other.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\">Underware
    has a good tutorial on letter design</a>\r\n\r\nAlso the wiki has some good links\r\n<a

  body: "This reminds me of stuff by <a href=\"http://fonts.tom7.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Divide
    By Zero</a>. It's kind of quirky and fun. I agree with Eron about the 'S' and
    's'. I don't mind the 'm' and 'n' - I think they fit the character of the font
    well.\r\n\r\nOverall, there's a lot of problems with contrast. Some glyphs ('7',
    '0', 'O') have a lot of contrast, while some ('X', 'x', 'M') have little to no
    contrast. Some glyphs have weight issues as well - the '2' and 'Z' seem kind of
    fat.\r\n\r\nI think your best shape is the 'g'. Try to get the other characters
    to be more consistent with it and each other.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "You really think so, Lex? I wasn't really satisfied with the \"g\" myself.
    It doesn't seem to have much relation to the other characters as they do to each
    other, at least as I see it.\r\n\r\nI've made the suggested changes to the \"S\"
    and \"s\", but I'll wait until morning to post another image. I have a few other
    fonts I'm working on that I'd like to get some feedback on too. Thanks for your
    help."

    is almost done (but it sure does look like I stole the a from this one), I think.
    Perhaps it is time to turn my attention back to this one, you think?\r\n\r\n"

    with the lc c - it doesn't belong here for some reason.

  body: "The top terminal of the 's' and also that of the 'r' get a bit thin, maybe.
    The dot of the 'i' could be placed a bit more upward, I think. The 'j' as well
    of course.\r\nI think the 'n' in itself is ok, but maybe a bit wide, when compared
    to the other glyphs. It has a very large space between the two strokes. I like
    the 'q' and the 'x' a lot. The capitals might be a bit too geometric? They lack
    the.. freedom of the lc, if you know what I mean. They are much more 'serious'."

  body: "A pet peeve I have with many fonts is the tendency of the \"r\" and \"n\",
    with tight kerning, slight over-inking, or even a modestly blurry monitor display,
    to combine to form what looks like an \"m\". I try to design those three letters
    with enough mutual distinction so that will not happen. \r\n\r\nYou may be right
    that I went a bit overboard with the \"n\" in this case, though."

  body: Yeah, I understand. I usually like it too when those characters are all individually
    drawn, instead of being chopped up versions of each other.

    I don't think it can be saved.\r\n\r\nIn the two years since I started this I
    have learned a lot, much at the guidance of all you good folks on this forum,
    and I have a much better eye for knowing something wrong when I see it, but I
    still have something to be desired when it comes to setting things right. To get
    what I set out to do here, a simple light serifed text face, I think I'll have
    to start from scratch."

    because I see potential uses for this font more than the other.  Take a break
    from Agamemnon and see what you can do with this.  When you rework this for a
    bit, it'll clear your mind and give you renewed vigor for Agamemnon.\r\n\r\nEspecialy
    if you add swash variants to this one, it could be a great display font.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    kill me for saying it, but it's a very sorority-esque font.  Would also work well
    I'd think with cards and products for things like baby showers and wedding showers

    that kind of women's shop! haha)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan

    this as a feminine products font, wouldn't it need a more feminine name? I'm terrible
    about coming up with things like that. Even the word \"bridal\" just makes me
    think of horses."
