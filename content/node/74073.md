body: "I'm trying to set up a contextual multiple substitution (one-to-many), but
  FOG 5 keeps choking on the feature file and won't generate a font. The same substitution
  works in VOLT for TrueType OpenType fonts, although the substitution works only
  in Microsoft programs, and not in Adobe programs.\r\n\r\nIn VOLT, I was able to
  set up the substitution as: \r\n \r\n<ul>   comma -> special_glyph comma <em>--
  when preceded by --</em> glyph_group </ul>\r\n \r\nNow I'm trying to use it in a
  feature file (based on Adobe specs) for generating a CFF OpenType font in Fontographer
  5.\r\n\r\nHere's the basic syntax for an Adobe spec feature file:\r\n\r\n<ul>    sub
  [ @Glyphclass ] comma' by specialglyph comma; </ul>\r\n\r\nEssentially, the comma
  should be replaced with both the specialglyph and the comma whenever the comma follows
  anything within the @Glyphclass. I can get the multiple substitution to work without
  the context, but it doesn't work with the context.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to set
  up a multiple substitution with a contextual exception? In other words, the substitution
  always happens, except in certain contexts (ignore substitution rule)?\r\n\r\nWould
  it work to use contextual chaining?\r\n\r\nIf the above is not possible with an
  Adobe spec feature file, is it possible to use VOLT to add OpenType layout to a
  CFF/PostScript .otf file made in FOG 5? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    doing multiple substitutions. This may've changed since I looked at this.\r\n\r\n-
    Yes, it is possible to do multiple substitution with exception context in VOLT.
    There are no restrictions on EXCEPT contexts unless they should go before 'normal'
    ones.\r\n\r\n- VOLT can load and compile CFF fonts, but won't show any glyphs.
    People working on CFF fonts usually convert them to TTFs for VOLT work and when
    layout tables are ready just move them into final font as binaries.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n\r\n"

    It is a one to multiple substitution."
