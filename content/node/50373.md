body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI got this doubt in InDesign concerning table of content
  styles. I've created a paragraph style for all entries and I've created a TOC style
  as well. Everything is working correctly except for some entries that are in ALL
  CAPS (because they are in all caps in the catalog as well). \r\n\r\nNow, is there
  anywhere in any style (TOC styles or paragraph styles) where I can set the case
  to \"Sentence case\"? Like I do now manually by going to Type - Change Case - Sentence
  Case.\r\n\r\nThe only options I see there for case are Normal, All Caps, Small Caps
  and OpenType All Small Caps. I really want to set the TOC to Sentece Case. But how?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\nPedro Peixoto"
