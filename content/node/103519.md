  body: "Here is the meaning. This was written in TextEdit, saved as html 4.01 Strict,
    No CSS, Unicode UTF-8,\_ and then massaged with an old sed script of mine.\r\n\r\nOutside,
    front:\r\n\r\nI skip what has already been translated.\_ I used the word \"stack\"
    (\u05E2\u05E8\u05D9\u05DE\u05D4) instead of \u05E7\u05D5\u05E4\u05E1\u05D4 for
    which I found no appropriate translation in the current context.\r\n\r\nShuffle
    the deck and distribute 5 cards to each player. The remaining cards are put in
    a stack, face down. Turn the upper card and put it open in the middle of the table..
    Choose the first player. The direction of play is leftwards (counter-clockwise).\r\n\r\nInside,
    right.\r\n\r\nEach player, in turn, tries to discard one card and put it, face
    up, on top of the card that is open in the center.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ordinary cards</strong>:
    On each of them there is one character from the Simpsons: Homer, Marge, Bart,
    Lisa or Maggie.\r\n\r\nEach ordinary card may be discarded\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>If
    the card in the middle is of the <strong>same character</strong>.</li>\r\n  <li>If\_
    the card in the middle is of the <strong>same colour</strong>.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Special
    cards</strong> - described here under - may be discarded according to the following
    rules.\r\n\r\nAll the family on a coloured background: May be discarded on a regular
    card of the same colour. The next player may discard on top of it a regular card
    of the same colour.\r\n\r\nInside, left.\r\n\r\nAll the family on a white background:
    May be discarded on a regular card of any colour. The next player my discard on
    top of it a regular card of any colour.\_\r\n\r\nThe typical accessory of each
    character (for instance Bart uses a skateboard). May be discarded on a card with
    the picture of the character using that accessory, of any colour. The next player
    may discard a card of the same character, of any colour.\r\n\r\nDad Homer and
    Mom Marge: May be discarded on top of a card on which there is the picture of
    Homer <strong>or</strong> of Marge, of any colour. The next player may discard
    on it a card of one member of the couple, of any colour.\r\n\r\nChange direction:
    May be discarded on top of any card and then the direction of play changes. The
    next player may discard any card on top of it.\r\n\r\nOutside, back.\r\n\r\nSkip
    turn: May be discarded on top of any card and the player that discards it may
    choose who plays next (if there are only two players, he who discards it wins
    a second turn).\_\r\n\r\n<strong>Notice</strong>: If a player is unable to discard
    when comes his turn he must take a card from the stack and that ends his turn.\r\n\r\n<strong>Last
    card</strong>: At the moment one player is left with only one card, he must say
    loud: \"Simpsons\". If he forgets, he must take 3 cards from the stack.\r\n\r\n<strong>The
    winner</strong> is the first who manages to discard all his cards, and he wins
    a token. After a series of plays, the winner is who has the largest number of
    tokens.\r\n\r\n<strong>Play and enjoy!</strong>\r\n"

    through their facebook page, cause I was wondering if it was a legitimate licensed
    product. They have replied back with: \"friend! Indeed this was\".\r\n \r\n I
    also thought it would be a little early for the show to be broadcast in Israel
    in 1991 or maybe to course for their tastes? Maybe that's just my own misconceptions.
