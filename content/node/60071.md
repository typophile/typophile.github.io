  ideas as to something similar? \r\nEspecially the a and e and the numbers seem quite
  ehm.. interesting. Handpainted?? Whatthefont wasn't really helpful, and I'm far

    case can be made for the other upper case letters being compressed forms, except
    for the H's which are likely sign painter-licensed variations.  \r\n\r\nLower
    case and numbers (esp. the 6) are from some other font."
