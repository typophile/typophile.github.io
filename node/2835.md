    a relatively crappy attempt to combine this poster with Milton Glaser&#39;s Dylan

    it loses out on what Wilson, Moscoso, and Albers knew so well about color vibrations&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>And it IS homage: I don&#39;t think that this design is trying to fool us

    of design history.'

    is probably a better word, but I believe both are appropriate for different reasons.

  body: ' &#62;I think it rises to a new level. <BR> <BR>I disagree entirely. &#34;design
    is a good idea&#34; is a pun. The double meanings are: 1&#41; that it is a good
    idea to design things and that, 2&#41; the term design can be defined as the execution
    of &#34;a good idea.&#34; <BR> <BR>Whereas: &#34;kerning is a good idea&#34; simply
    means that it is a good idea to kern. The pun is lost. Worse, the idea and the
    design for the shirt is ripped-off making the attempted parody an awkward and
    embarassing imitation of a superior original. It lacks any sensitivity or understanding
    of the original concept. '

    was in the Met and I was literally frozen in my tracks. A Williams fan, I recognized
    the reference even before reading the title. It&#39;s such a masterful and tasteful
    visual interpretation of verse. A true homage. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think the
    &#34;kerning is a good idea&#34; submission even begins to approach that same
    level of sophistication. And I disagree that the whole point is the context of
    the original. It&#39;s just another example of designers failing to really appreciate
    the power of the written word. Unlike &#34;I Saw the Figure Five in Gold&#34;
    which sensitively captures the color and rhythm of Williams&#39; verse, the &#34;kerning&#34;
    example merely parrots the look of its predecessor.  <BR> <BR>Literacy is the
    first skill of a good designer. Without it we&#39;re merely aimless decorators. '

    in fact a sophisticated &#34;inside joke&#34;: the font at hand is Base Nine &#40;Bold&#41;

    said, &#39;I love Demuth too&#39; and left.  <BR> <BR>again homage means you can
