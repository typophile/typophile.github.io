  pothole and figured this was the best crowd to ask.\r\n\r\nI am a designer and small-business
  owner that has 2 LLCs to my name. I have purchased single-machine licenses in the
  past for type that I would use for my design business - graphics that I would create
  and sell. Now that the second LLC has opened, I am looking at an interesting dilemma.\r\n\r\nIn
  regards to using the typefaces and purchasing further type for use in various aspects
  of the business: Should I continue purchasing the fonts in my name if I am the designer
  that creates all the graphics, and the fonts continue to reside and are only used
  on one machine? Or am I supposed to be purchasing these licenses in the name of
  the business since they are profiting (???) from the usage of the type?\r\n\r\nAs
  far as I understand, licensing tends to be by machine or individual, regardless
  of end-use. So if I'm the one creating the work, no matter who profits from the
  work in the end, as long as the typeface remains on only my machine then there is
  no infringement. And it would be nice if I didn't have to purchase a license for
  each business to use the same type, especially if I'm the one creating all of the
  designs.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, and let me know if there is more information
  I can provide. Appreciate the advice."

    actual font software, not for example the publisher of a printed book, that uses
    that design. \r\nHowever, it gets more complicated, when the font software becomes
    part of the \u201Cend-use\u201D, e.g. in an e-book. \r\n"

      assumed this was the case, but wanted reassurance from the more experienced.
      Thank you!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>However, it gets more complicated, when the font

      makes sense as the software in the ebook would be rendering the font at that
      point, rather than the typeface being pre-rendered."
