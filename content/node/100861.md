body: "What are some of your favorite extended typefaces?\r\n\r\nI prefer Reservation
  Wide, by Silas Dilworth. Right now, it seems to be my go-to typeface for extended
  type. Idlewild by HFJ is another favorite. \r\n\r\nObvious ones like Helvetica and
  Univers will probably dominate this list, but what are some of your favorite extended
  typefaces? "

    like it, and what type of things it can be used for. Links are okay, too. Thanks
    to everybody.

      are mainly because of the variety within the family. I'm a sucker for thick/thin
      contrasts next to each other."

    especially the italic. Both are great for signs and vehicle graphics and well
    received by clients. '

  body: Microgramma. Without a doubt. No other contenders for me; 'cept maybe Eurostyle
    Extended. I desperately wanted to use these faces when I was an apprentice comp.
    in the sixties but my boss was too tight-fisted to buy them.
