body: This is a dumb question but how does one activate or deactivate opentype features
  when using an Opentype font that has these features built into it? Features like
  stylistic alternatives or prebuilt fractions for example?

    top right. Then you choose "Open Type" from the list and all are listed. Way too
    complicated and hidden, but there it is. '

  body: "Thanks for the chart Mr. Shinn. I'm bookmarking it. \r\n\r\nThis is what
    I thought too, but I was just checking with you guys. In order to use them, a
    user must access some type of palette or special window or whatever within that
    program, and that program has to be OpenType savvy.\r\n\r\nLike I said. Dumb question.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm wondering lately is, is it still a good thing to create a separate font for
    small caps, or is it better to include the small caps into your font as a feature?
    I wonder because, not everyone uses OpenType savvy apps. Some use old software,
    but they might want those small caps and be willing to buy a separate small-caps
    version of the font. Same thing with dingbats and arrows. If you have a separate
    dingbats file, don't you think you could still sell it as a separate font, or
    is it just time to cram everything into one font and tell people about how much
    is included inside of it? I see so many foundries that do the latter and just
    expect their users to use certain software. \r\n\r\nI'm looking at Office 2010
    in the chart and it hardly supports any OT features! It does not support Small
    Caps, for example. So that's exactly my point and what I was wondering about.
    Word users will freak out if they buy your OT font and can't get all of those
    features to work, right? And if you give them a disclaimer before-hand, they will
    not want to buy it anymore. I really am leaning towards not using features, and
    creating a separate font for Small-caps and dingbats, like font foundries did
    in the old days, and yes, people will have to pay extra to have it.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you guys think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would think the majority of font purchasers have access to OpenType savvy
    apps (and that majority will only increase in the future), so I would include
    them in the font. Then I would estimate whether the additional sales to non-OT
    purchasers would be worth the hassle of adding an additional separate font of
    smallcaps, and if so, I'd make it and throw it into the same package.

  body: Thanks for your input. I'm going to repost this as a new thread so that it
    gets some more attention because it got buried at the bottom of this one. I'd
    like to get some more input from others and was hoping for more than one reply.
