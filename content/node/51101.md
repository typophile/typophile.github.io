    be the typophile \"featured face\" on Nov 4! \r\n\r\nIt will probably crash the

    there's enough extra points in each glyph to crash the site 10 times over, though.\r\n\r\n@Dezcom:
    I was trying to think of something type-related, but \"Optically Scalin' Palin\"
    doesn't really make any sense. Anything you can think of, in the world of type,
    that rhymes with Palin?"

  body: "@BlueStreak: Judging by the state of the conservative movement today in America,
    maybe The National Review should start publishing their articles in Palin Dudes.
    If Obama is GQ urbane with his use of Gotham, then the conservatives need a rural
    imperfect typeface.\r\n\r\n@Dezcom: Wasilla would be a fantastic name for a typeface,
    I'm not sure what it would look like though. It would definitely need a Cyrillic
    version, regardless, with its proximity to Russia."
