  body: Number 1 is not a typeface. It appears to be some kind of  <BR>carved letters.
    <BR> <BR>Number 3 looks like Devinne Italic or, since it&#39;s in German,  <BR>it
    could be Lateinisch, H. Berthold&#39;s Devinne look-alike.  <BR>Neither of these
    is available digitally that I know of, but  <BR>Bitstream&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/">Romana</a>
    is very close. No italic unfortunately. <BR> <BR>Couldn&#39;t find the script
    in any of my books. Troubador has  <BR>some similarities &#40;such as the uppercase
    M&#41;.

  body: You could approximate the look of number 1 in print by using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helveticarounded/">Helvetica
    Rounded Bold Condensed</a> or similar. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19152.gif"

  body: 'As Mark Simonson said, #3 it looks like Lateinisch from Berthold. <BR> <BR>I
    want to add that this font was digitized by a Russian foundry, ParaType &#40;<a
    href="http://www.paratype.com" target="_blank">www.paratype.com</a>&#41;. They
    named it Literaturnaya. <BR> <BR>The font was donated to public domain, but only
    for use in TeX applications. It can be found in various russian TeX archives,
    both PFB and metrics, but the encoding is for TeX. Be sure to read the licence,
    cause it is not quite a free font.'
