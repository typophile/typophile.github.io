  body: "Try ampersands instead of that small caps treatment for the 'AND's. \r\n\r\nThe
    spacing between the '|' and the words on the right seems inconsistent between
    each iteration. I would also increase the amount of space between the '|' and
    the stuff on either side. \r\n\r\nThe letter spacing in combination with the condensed
    face makes it look like a monospaced font. I might reduce the tracking a bit.\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>penn</em>"

  body: "I'd go for a lighter weight of type for the departmental names, whose stroke
    weight is near as possible to the heavy strokes of \"TEXAS\".\r\n\r\nI'd also
    thicken up the dividing rule a little.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there's not a strong
    relationship between the left and right sides."

  body: "I agree with what the others have said, and I would also make the vertical
    rule the same height as the logo on the left. If you reduce the tracking on the
    right side, you can make those words bigger too, making them line up with the
    top and bottom of the left side and the rule. This will unify everything a little
    nicer.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    up (on the left) can't be 'touched' ... it feels pretty dated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're right about the logo on the left being beyond our control. I secretly
    find it hilarious that you find it \"dated\" since they just came out with it
    a few months ago as a \"freshing\" of the \"old\" logo which was only a couple
    of years old. You can see the old logo at the top of the library's current page:
    http://library.uta.edu/. \r\n\r\nThanks to all for the comments. Others are still
    welcome.\r\n"
