    not an appetizing color. I&#39;m thinking warm tones. Those colors will go better
    with the place and the food, and will stand out better on signage. I agree with
    Hrant, try flaring strokes. This will help to humanize it.  And, sorry, the forks
    aren&#39;t working for me -- too fussy. '

    don&#39;t say Mediterranean, and they cheapen the look. If the blue background

    is industrial not appealing. <BR> <BR>Could you post a sample of Harmony as well? '

  body: Thanks for the critiques. Here is a few of the reasons for the selected choices.
    The blue is representative of the Mediterranean sea and the colors of the Greek
    flag. I am designing for contrast, as signage is outdoors and establishment is
    open till&#39; 2am daily. Lettering used on signage are reflective, as to be more
    visible at night. Colors are very limited when using reflective, so  <BR>choices
    came down to yellow, white, silver and red. Background colors could not be &#34;warm&#34;
    colors, ie tans, beige, soft greens or blues as reflective materials are not available
    in these colors. Best match for background colors came down to complementary colors
    that would match reflective colors. Blue was the choice.  <BR> <BR>I designed
    a Sans Serif face to match the body type of Harmony. The suggestion of using Jeremy
    Tankard&#39;s &#34;Sophia&#34; was a good suggestion, in fact an inspiration for
    my &#34;E&#34; design.  <BR> <BR>I am surprised at how little commentators like
    the forks. I guess  <BR>I thought it was clever.They were intended to be more
    decorative <BR>than iconographic.  <BR> <BR>Besides the post I uploaded yesterday
    there are other elements <BR>to consider. Here are a few more. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26255.jpg"

    shaped E that is as bad as chop suey type for a chinese restaurant. Nicely played.
    But before moving to the signage &#40;which I agree is busy&#41;, i want to voice
    some concern about the execution of MED MIX. It looks to me like it has a light/shadow
    chisel thing happening. That is nice, though it looks a little inconsistent with
    where the light would be if it was actually chisled. Check the widths of the white
    areas too for consistency &#40;could be the gif&#41;. You also have a dimensionality
    to it '

  body: 'Thanks for the critiques. Daniel you commented that everything screams for
    attention. This is true. This is actually intentional.  The restaurant is located
    between 2 bars with heavy, crowded foot traffic especially on week-end nights.
    Some clients &#40;at these  <BR>hours&#41; are often inibriated, or in the process
    of becoming so.In some ways it&#39;s important to be a bit loud graphically speaking.
    The same reason for using reflective materials. As you can tell from menu &#40;prices&#41;
    this is not high-end,  but really great Mediterranean basics at affordable prices.
    The owner made a lot of good decisions with the location and menu offerings. The
    result is that often the place is packed with people waiting in line. I think
    what has become most obvious in all the critiques is that the forks may be too
    &#34;obvious&#34; instead of a little added nuance. The bold type is unusual for
    menu design but in my opinion appropriate to the clients. I do have a ligther
    weight which looked classier but was ruled out because it was less legible at
    a distance. There is no menus on the tables but a couple huge backlit menus with
    photos of the food behind the counter. I should comment that design should always
    be viewed in context, which is obviously somewhat limited on a discussion board,
    as atmosphere is hard to absord as well as antisipating <BR>the interaction clients
    are having with the design/and or services offered. I sent the typophile link
    to my client with the warning that people visiting site leaving critiques are
    pros and  <BR>often very critical compared to his customers visiting the establishment.
    He phoned me after reading a few critiques and sounded a bit shocked. He is a
    great client to work with and has left me with a lot of the choices other than
    the actual content. A lot of trust- which was much apprciated. So what did I learn
    from this experience/job. well for starters, most designs can always be improved
    upon &#40;especially if budget/time frame allows&#41;, Example- one of my firms
    web designs we did for a client last year is not to my personal quality standars,
    as it could be refined &#40;which we just started on&#41; but with 36 hrs to launch
    from start to finish- the timing was the priority and not the fine tuning of all
    elements and text. The solution: do your best. To be honest, this job ran 40 hours
    over budget &#40;which I ate&#41; due to a miscalculation on the extremely slow
    process of working at full resolution on the backlit 160&#34; x 24 menu boards
    that are over 800 megs &#40;at 240 flattened dpi&#41;,  with many changes over
    the  <BR>course of the job. Client ended up getting a bit impatient as things
    were running late &#40;which is understandable&#41;, so where does one quit. Hopefully
    not untill it is the best it can be. But when exactly is that? A lot of smaller
    budget jobs do not allow for focus groups, so it becomes a lot of personal choices
    based on observations regarding the clients target market, objectives, etc...  <BR>Always
    a challenge, but I guess this is why we loved doing what we do.   '

  body: 'Hey Randy. Thanks for the props. Well I am afraid I will dissappoint you
    a bit, as stated earlier it is only the Logo type that I designed, not the body
    copy &#40;called Harmony, by designer unkown to me&#41;. The reason for choosing
    the body copy to be set in Harmony vs. all the other choices out there, was that
    it is readable at a distance,  familiar and friendly like the folks that work
    at Med Mix. As for the Logo type, the chisel effect with a single source of light,
    was kind of where this was going when I started but then it shifted direction
    into where it ended up... an eclectic mix of cuts. As for the devits, I confess
    I was unable in solving the issue with the devits in the M. I tried 4 or five
    different angles/cuts but nothing worked so with the time running out, I chose
    the results yoy see. I will post a few other version in a few minutes so you can
    see process... <BR>As far as the borders. I am not exactly sure what this classic
    greek pattern is called but it is traditional. I personally like the mix of all
    the elements but perhaps it is not to everyones liking.  <BR>In the mix of feelings
    people like yourself have about it, perhaps there could be a better choice to
    go with only forks, or just the border. '
