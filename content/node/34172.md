  makes for a good thread starter, and what makes for good comments. (btw I'm number

    how good/popular a thread/topic was by counting the total number of responses
    it got. Within that you might want to get the number of different users that were
    involved in the discussion. (You know, there are threads that look like ping-pong

    the diversity of posters is a good idea. For a while we've been thinking about
    ways to let some of the better threads float to the top. There is always the option
    of adding voting systems, etc, but it seems like queries that use intrinsic data
    that demonstrate interest are going to be better than prompting users for votes.\r\n\r\nThere
    may also be ways to look at number of reads, and how often a diversity of people
    return to a certain thread."

    another interesting stat: assuming the spam was distributed\r\ntotally randomly,
    it's possible to see what percentage of threads a member\r\nhas participated in,
    by dividing the number of the member's threads hit\r\nby fornode by 200 (the number
    of threads spammed). I'm 39%.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
