    body: "Thanks everyone for the responses and suggestions. This is sort of a mass
      reply to all of the postings thus far: \r\n\r\nOn some of the earlier promptings,
      I checked out more threads on typophile (and elsewhere), and found a good deal
      of the answers I was looking for. Thanks for the links and references (particularly
      the last one, Tiffany.)\r\n\r\nAs for the ten years statement... it's true that
      digital type piracy has been around a bit longer, but I feel that trends in
      technology (p2p filesharing, faster connections, greater access to computers
      worldwide, etc.) have created a unique mode of piracy. But then again, it was
      a bit \"shortsighted\" on my part. Does anyone think that there's a benchmark
      for \"the modern mode of type piracy\"? The emergence of desktop publishing?
      The publishing of type 1 encoding? Desktop printers?\r\n\r\nHrant, these two
      points are very interesting. \r\n\r\n2) I think the main cultural effect has
      been that more people spend more time making type simply because they love doing
      so, which speeds up evolution.\r\n3) On the other hand, a certain high-end category
      of designer is now less likely to spend time making type (especially in the
      retail sphere).\r\n\r\nDo you think that this indicates a rise in non-retail
      typography (like custom designs for magazines and corporate usage?)\r\n\r\nNorbert,
      I'll let you know when I have some results. I've been interviewing design students,
      non-designers, and \"professional\" graphic designers and was surprised to find
      how many use \"freeware\" fonts as an alternative to both buying fonts and stealing
      them. \r\n\r\nI also created an <a href='http://youpop.com/survey.html'>online
      survey</a> (anyone feel free to fill it out), but I'm not sure about people
      admitting to theft online. The ratio between how many faces people have on their
      CPUs vs how many they use is somewhat amusing (or apalling, depending on perspective).
      \r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n"

    I would be very interested in some of your findings, that is, if you are willing
    to share them.\r\n\r\nI also am just beginning research on the usage of <em>true
    cut</em> versus <em>freebie</em> fonts from the graphic designers' perspective.
    After all, they would be the discerning buying market (but not necessarily the
    largest market) for typefaces."

  body: "Very interesting. As an issue this is certainly older than just the last
    decade. And it means that now people often design type just because they love
    doing it and they realise that it's very hard to control distribution of the end
    product once it's out there. I think widespread piracy may also distort the foundries'
    sales figures of the most commonly used fonts, because after all those are the
    ones that are being ripped/copied/borrowed/pirated the most.\r\n\r\nThis is such
    a widespread phenomenon that clients frequently question why they would need to
    budget for font(s) as part of a design project.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of sounding
    provocative in the present company, a recent academic conversation here in NZ
    suggested that investigating the whole of type development's history (Gutenberg
    onwards?) as an ongoing form of appropriation would be a worthwhile study. Looking
    at the family tree feature at myfonts might give an indication of what 'other
    foundries recuts/versions' does for releases, rather than sales."

    means I have a lot of apparantly illegal software on my computer. BUT the fact
    is \u2014 I pay for the stuff I actually use. Same goes for programs. I'll try
    a demo (or if it's not available a cracked version) of a program and if I think
    it's ok, I'll pay up. Let me be clear: Software is the largest outlay my firm
    has, after the mortgage on our office and italian espresso coffee ; ).\r\n\r\nThat
    may not be the \u2018proper\u2019 way of doing things \u2014 but then there's
    the other side of the equation: I buy all of the music I listen to (I have never
    ever downloaded a song without paying for it), I have never burned a \u201Cback
    up copy\u201D of any of the 120+ DVD's and 250+ CD's own (and payed for), BUT
    I do have to pay a surcharge on all of the media (CD's and DVD's) I use to make
    backups of work files, because some government appointed foundation here (in the
    Netherlands) has to wherewithal to just do that \u2014 I mean imposing that surcharge.
    The next item on their agenda is hitting MP3 players with a special fine, so go
    figure.\r\n\r\nI have a PayPal account to pay for shareware, I support small foundries
    and software makers by paying for their stuff, even if I hardly use it, so I think
    I am on the right side of the track here.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the whole discussion
    about the big foundries ripping of each other stuff (ATF anyone?) \u2014 that's
    been going on for a century and more, because a lot of countries never ratified
    the Berne Convention\u2026 As long as there's no universal vision re intellectual
    property, you won't be able to get a clear picture on this (but you WILL be able
    to buy a seventies design German car in China for a really LOW price)."

  body: "I checked out your survey, John and it's very direct and straight forward.
    But I think that if you get rid of the word \"Piracy\" in the title, you may get
    a more honest set of responses.\r\n\r\nI don't sense that the majority of graphic
    designers using type truly understand what piracy of a type design is, nor do
    they relate a sense of \"authorship\" to designs and therefore <em>a font is a
    font is a font</em>.\r\n\r\nI think most users of computers do understand the
    protection/licensing aspect of \"pricey\" software, like Microsoft Office, Adobe
    Photoshop, Quark, InDesign, etc. and they also know of potential consequences
    for distributing bootleg copies. \r\n\r\nIt is a very very common practice to
    search and download useful free-or-shareware, and in fact, the general software
    industry accepts and sometime even produce them. But the VALUE of the software
    is related to WHAT IT DOES and WHO DEVELOPED it, and to some degree, computer
    users attach a sense of \"quality\" to software produced by well known development
    companies (Intuit, Adobe, etc.).\r\n\r\nSo when your novice or everyday walk-around
    young graphic designer downloads a copy of the <em>Jurassic Park</em> typeface
    from a free site, I'm sure they are not even aware of the existence of Neuland
    Inline, or if they did, they just believe the \"free\" face is just not at the
    same quality of the \"pricey\" font.\r\n\r\nTo most designers <em>piracy</em>
    is the illegal use or replication of software, and if someone can find a nice
    looking or close match to a PAY font as a free download, to them it's NOT stealing.\r\n\r\nTherefore
    your use of \"Piracy\" in your survey title sets up another set of responses from
    your average computer user, whether they are graphic designers or not. If your
    survey's title was just \"Font Usage\" your respondents would be less guarded.\r\n\r\nA
    NEW FONT POLL\r\n(I hate seeing the term font and typeface used interchangeably,
    but I guess it's already accepted.)\r\n\r\nI've developed a set of twenty questions
    that are presented in a tone that is particularly suited to the information I
    want to gather. Some of the questions are related to free vs. pay, some to purchasing
    habits, and others on awareness of new type designs. I don't plan to use them
    all at once in a single survey. At the moment I am planing to take smaller sets
    of questions and post them as polls on various designer sites. Some of my questions
    are very similar to yours, such as:\r\n<dl> <dt>Do you know what a font EULA (End
    User License Agreement) is?</dt> <dd>__ no</dd><dd>__ yes, but never read it</dd><dd>__
    yes, and ocassionally read it</dd><dd>__ yes, and always read it</dd><dd>__ yes,
    but don't care</dd></dt></dl>\r\n\r\nI'll will from time to time post some in-progess
    results, that is if I even get any replies."
