body: Hello all, I am by no means a computer genius and I really want to know whether
  or not Adobe's Bickham Script standard font opentype version will work on my program
  before I buy it because I can't find a TrueType version anymore. I am willing to
  purchase it if it's out there of course, but I can't find it.  I use Window's XP,
  Freehand MX.  Any help would really be appreciated!! ThistleBerry Press

    fully, since it doesn't support more than 256 characters or any OpenType features.\r\nWhy
    do you look for a TrueType version of Bickham? Windows XP will just work fine
    with any PostScript flavoured OpenType font, like Bickham Script (Pro).\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info"

  body: Hi Ralf, I don't necessarily want a TrueType version, I just thought that's
    what I needed.  Now, if I buy Bickham Script Pro to use specifically in Freehand
    MX will I get the punctuation and numbers? Or will I just get capitals and lowercase?  Thanks
    for your reply!

  body: Without OpenType support you only get the basic latin character set, which
    includes everything you would normally expect to find in a font--caps, lowercase,
    numbers, punctuation, etc.--, but not the extra characters--alternates, swashes,
    Central European, etc.

  body: "I'd like to point out a terminologic unclarity: \"OpenType support\" means
    different things. I usually say \"OpenType Layout support\" when I refer to the
    ability to handle the advanced typographic features. Freehand \"supports\" OpenType
    as a font format to the extent that it does support other font formats: the Roman
    codepage (256 character) and no advanced typography support. On the other hand,
    Adobe CS applications offer Unicode and OpenType Layout support. \r\n\r\nA."

    to keep it simple.

  body: "It is also worth noting that Kern Pairs may not necessarily be supported.
    We certainly had a problem with a TTF flavoured font that had both Pairs and Kern
    Feature tables. Neither Freehand 10 nor MX saw the pairs. Killing the Kern Feature
    resolved the problem on the TTF at least.\r\nI seem to remember that kern feature
    table fonts give no access to older apps. I am not sure now, if you can actually
    build OTF (CFF) based fonts using Kern Pair tables or if they only come as layout
    feature.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag Ltd"

  body: ATM and the Adobe code that both Apple and Microsoft use for OTF (CFF) font
    support creates a standard kern table for older apps. The table is a subset of
    pairs derived from the kern feature, with all but western latin characters filtered
    out (more or less).

    an upgrade rate since Adobe owns them both now.
