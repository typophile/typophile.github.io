body: "I do exist, you know!\r\n\r\nI have to talk to you about this. I am annoyed.
  I know you do not perceive me and still you can\u2019t do without me. Do you think
  I am crazy? Why do you think I am here? I am the best thing that happened to you
  since you were warming your bum by the camp fire and wild animals saw you as their
  evening meal. \xB6 In the mean time, I have to tolerate your constant staring at
  me. Time and time again I try to take on other forms and shapes, tens of thousands
  of times, ranging from big to small, from loud to modest and soft to hard. I adapt
  to differing political times, art trends and signs of the times, whatever they may
  be. I can be as light-footed as a feather in a light summer breeze, slender as a
  coke sniffing fashion model, broad-chested and present as a tattooed body builder,
  subtly secluded like a hermit, creative as Picasso and common as Comic Sans. Is
  it starting to dawn on you by now? Have I lifted the veil a bit? You will burn in
  hell if you still don\u2019t get it! Look, look again, are you seeing me now? \xB6
  OK, OK, I realise I am asking too much of your tiny little brain. I will give you
  some more clues. I can be moving and bring tears to your eyes. I can be hard and
  show you truths you can\u2019t avoid. I can be poetical and make you crave for love
  or mean and distant and make your heart bleed. But I can also make you feel rotten
  and redundant like a discarded piece of meat \u2212 exactly like you are making
  me feel now. \xB6 I don\u2019t want to keep my final trumps from you. I have seen
  to it that you know who you are. I make sure you won\u2019t forget and you can build
  on what has always been. I can make you feel that you matter and that you exist.
  I am powerful and omnipresent. You can\u2019t do without me and you can\u2019t get
  away from me. You can talk a person\u2019s head off and your words will vanish into
  thin air. But that won\u2019t happen to me, you soulless jester. \xB6 Sooner or
  later you will perceive me and you will realise my importance to you. Or else take
  this lament with you in your grave and I will wait and see if your descendants have
  more sense and compassion than you. I have deserved my place in time and won\u2019t
  have it taken away from me. \xB6 I give up ... I am the type you read and can\u2019t
  do without. I am your memory and your future. Look into my favourite book Letter
  Fountain and learn to value me, every day all over again. Let me surprise you by
  the different appearances I can take on at your screen, your mobile or in your book.
  Do not forget me and show me the respect I deserve.\r\n\r\nVerba volant, scripta
  manent\r\n\r\n(Joep Pohlen, 2010)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monologue1_4701.jpg]"
