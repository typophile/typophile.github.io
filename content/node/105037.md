body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this poster I really wanted to get an original for
  in my living room. Since it will cost me around 15oo dollars(!) I decided to make
  my own. I drove the guys in the studio mad because no one could identify it (they
  are no true typophiles like you guys)!\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify this font for
  me?\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n- Eelco"

  body: Univers Ultra Condensed BQ is close but the S is not right. It is a great
    poster!

  body: Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed Bold has same problem as Univers - the S has horizontal
    ends.

  body: The middle bar of the -E is shorter than the rest. This is also different
    from the Univers or the Akzidenz-Grotesk...

  body: "Can't identify either but can't stop thinking this /S looks borrowed from
    another font. \r\n2 options:\r\n- you're after the real name and I can't help
    more\r\n- you just want to reproduce it and have enough skills to do it so your
    best choice is to start with Univers Ultra Condensed suggested by bojev, borrow
    the /S from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-sans|Benton Sans]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]
    (squooshing it)/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-gothic|News Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic|Trade
    Gothic]]. A ready-to-go alternative: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dunwich/lorimer-no-2-condensed|Lorimer

  body: "Hi Ryuk,\r\nI was thinking the same. Reproducing it is probably the best
    thing to do. Can't help to still think it is a font since the smaller lines have
    the same S..."

  body: You could also set it up in Illustrator, convert type to paths and edit points
    to fit concept. That is how I would duplicate the effect - pretty quick really.
