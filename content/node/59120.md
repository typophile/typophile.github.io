body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mopa_3455.jpg]\r\nHi everyone. Guess this
  might be more of a type suggestion rather than a type ID as I suspect Studio Mopa's
  logo is custom designed, them being designers and all!\r\n\r\nSo, my question is
  anyone know of anything similar? Any kind of scripty/brush fonts that have character
  and look nice?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, greatly received! Many thanks,\r\nTerry"
