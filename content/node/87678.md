  black letter type. From my limited research on the origins of black letter type
  I haven't been able to find one that comes from Spain. Which black letter typeface
  is known to have come out of Spain? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As far as I know, Rotunda is a blackletter style invented in Italy, but it
    was very popular in Spain during the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Crombergers
    had probably the most important printing house in Spain at the time, and their
    books are most of the times set in Rotunda. Some examples by Jacobo Cromberger
    [[http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/autores/2919/|here.]] Among other reasons,
    they are relevant here because they settled the first printing press in the Americas
    (Mexico City, 1539) by sending an Italian employee, Juan Pablos. Some years later,
    Pablos hired Antonio de Espinosa, a Spaniard type designer that most likely cut
    some types for him in Mexico City. My [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/rotunda-bold-alt/|Espinosa
    Nova Rotunda]] is a revival of one of those types.\r\n\r\nSome other examples
    of good rotundas are [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=661069|Cresci
    Rotunda]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/san-marco/|San Marco]] and
    [[http://www.munchfonts.com/Duomo/viewtext.html|Duomo]]. All of them are really
    Italian, though."
