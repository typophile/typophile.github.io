  body: BJ thanks for hooking us up with this link. I added it to my Newsfire that
    same day and promptly wasted too much time reading that night. <BR> <BR>Today&#39;s
    news is about &#34;Master Typographer&#34; Ed Benguiat. Who can argue with that
    statement?! <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.posterwire.com/archives/2005/04/18/super-type/"

  body: Sorry, this is completely off-topic, but did anyone pick up on the link to
    the <a href="http://glennferon.com/">professional retoucher</a>? <BR> <BR>Go look
    at the portfolio. It shows you before and after versions of stuff he&#39;s worked
    on ... <BR> <BR>!!! <BR> <BR>R

  body: '&#62; He didn&#39;t design Avant Garde Gothic and Caslon? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    misleading the way they put it. He designed ITC Avant Garde Gothic Condensed and
    ITC Caslon 224. <BR> <BR>Kind of strange to choose those two since they are not
    the faces that made him famous as a type designer.'

  body: ITC Souvenir and ITC Tiffany. Other candidates would be ITC Bookman, ITC Korinna,
    and ITC Benguiat. He did lots of faces for ITC, but those would be among the most
    popular &#40;though some of them aren&#39;t so popular any more&#41;.
