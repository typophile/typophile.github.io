it looks like we've lost a valuable member of our community. and i'm fairly certain that the reason why was because of bigoted remarks on typophile. i've got a fairly tough skin and can ignore quite a bit of stupidity, but apparently some folks just wont stand for it. just another reason to watch what you say. please play nicely.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm sorry Paul I don't understand this post. What sort of bigoted remarks was this individual saying- racist, sexist, large foundries suck, anti-pc, anti-mac, hated the Chinese, hated digital, liked picking on newbies... what was it and how do you know?
Maybe the individual quit the Typophile forum. And who are the people that determine that an individual should be 'outta here'?

<div class=commentbody>I guess I didn't see it. Did you edit it out as moderator?
I would hope that that would mollify those who are offended.
As I've said, I would like to see the moderators have a heavier hand, but moderating is voluntary--thank you Paul!!--it's probably not possible.
I'm regularly put off by insults on Typophile--individual and group--but I've come to see that as unfortunately a practically unavoidable feature of the internet. </div>

I don't know Chester personally at all, but maybe he left because—in the face of such hostility in the "Gay typeface" thread from certain individuals—none of us stepped in and put a stop to it.
Thinking about that in retrospect, that would make me want to go away, too.</div>
