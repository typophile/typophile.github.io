  Garamond, by Garamond himself, was missing the serif at the top right hand corner
  of the cap \"M\". Does anyone know about this? I was wondering if anyone had ever
  seen this, I'm very curious to see it, or to know more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201Cparticular
  such letter is the capital M , which in the early models lacked the serif at the
  top of the right stem.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlexander Lawson, \u201CGaramond.\u201D in Anatomy
  of a Typeface (Boston: David R. Godine, 1990), pg 133.\r\n"

  body: "The right ear of Garamond\u2019s M \u2013 almost as famous and mysterious
    as Van Gogh\u2019s left ear.\r\n\r\nThe short version is that Jenson\u2019s M
    had bracketed top serifs extending outward and inward.\r\nSee (a) in the illustration
    below.\r\n\r\nThe M of Aldus Manutius\u2019 typeface had only one ear on the left
    and no right-hand top serif\r\nSee (b) in the illustration below.\r\n\r\nEarly
    Garamond typefaces followed this 'one-eared' approach, and it was only later that
    these typefaces got two top serifs extending outward.\r\nSee (c) in the illustration
    below.\r\n\r\nFot this reason it was assumed that Garamond copied Aldus\u2019
    typeface.\r\nThis theory is quite convincing. \r\n\r\nThe only problem that there
    were four or five punchcutters around at the same time (including Augereau, Gryphius,
    de Colines, Garamond and some others) who were designing typefaces of a similar,
    new style (what is nowadays called \u2018Garamond\u2019), and it is very likely
    that some of the typefaces which were formerly attributed to Garamond were actually
    designed by someone else. \r\n\r\nThis article has more information:\r\nHendrik
    D. L.Vervliet: \u2018The young Garamont: roman types made from 1530 to 1540\u2019,
    in: Typography Papers no 7 (2007), pp 5\u201360\r\n\r\n[The illustration is from
    Vervliet\u2019s article: \u2018The young Garamond\u2019. It shows the principle
    of the top serifs, not the real, original typefaces]\r\n\r\nFor more info about
