body: "Hello again.\r\n\r\nI've been working extensively (overtime) on a logo for
  a new NYC advertising firm/agency/company. It's gone through a scary amount of revisions
  and I almost want to just scrap everything and start again.\r\n\r\nThis is one of
  the toughest logos I've worked on to date. My client asked for something that looks
  modern, powerful, edgy/rebellious, sexy, and razor-sharp (to symbolize the cutthroat
  industry).\r\n\r\nBut he also wants a stylized infinity loop\u2014which seems like
  a no brainer, but it's been one of the most difficult things to make unique... and
  I am trying to integrate it somehow with the logotype so that it doesn't seem so
  disconnected. I'm currently frustrated at how hard it is to put a loop anywhere
  on the logo without it seeming unbalanced or weird.\r\n\r\nThe logo must have \"Infinity
  Advertising\" in it, which makes a for a loooong logo when not tightly kerned or
  stacked. Well, take a look at what I've got for this round of revisions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ia-logo-concepts_5296.png]\r\n\r\nI
  loved #1, but I couldn't make an infinity loop that looked good next to it, so I
  tried to make one around it. The IA mark is something both my client and I really
  love because it's so \"perfectly modern\" as my client says, but again, I cannot
  match a loop with that severely sharp point on the A.\r\n\r\nAn idea struck me for
  making the loop play between the Y and A, so I attempted it first with a hand-made
  slab serif type in #3. Then I tried out different weights and finally a more sans-serif
  variant (but I'm afraid that the ultra thick weight of #6 along with how geometric
  it is makes it look too constructivist/soviet). I actually like #3 the most since
  it doesn't have the connecting bar.\r\n\r\n#7 was just a completely different direction,
  trying to make a stylized, classy loop with some Gill Sans logotype. I think it
  is too typical and makes me think of a university. I dunno. I've been looking at
  this stuff for way too long.\r\n\r\nSorry for such a huge first post! Hoping to
  get some critiques and suggestions. Thank you very much."

  body: "I like #1 and #4 but if I was the advertising company I would probably go
    with #1 b/c it looks 'edgy'. However, I think the infinity concept makes sense
    to do. #4 sort of looks celtic and I don't like the 'g' at the end. \r\n\r\n#2
    could look cool if the loop circled around 'advertising' as well. Maybe the loop
    can go down into the 'v', loop around 'ertising' then come back up top and connect
    to the 'y'."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI like the design process and the thinking that went behind this.
    Definitely a tough task at hand..\r\n\r\nPersonally, #1 has the best typography,
    clean and crisp. The razor-blades of the Y-A: nice and rebel-sexy too. (Perhaps
    a 'y' (compared to 'Y') with that right legtail slant is better to balance A's
    right leg?)\r\n\r\nAn infinity-symbol is almost a prerequisite with a name like
    'infinity'. No surprise. Where to incorporate it? #2 is too overpowering. \r\n\r\nSomething
    subtle like fujitsu's would do better, but how do we make that unique..?\r\n\r\nOne
    suggestion is to optimise the 'ini' and 'isi' in the name itself. Perhaps, putting
    the infinity symbol in between a stacked infinity and advertising could work.
    Not sure the balance and weight, though and the kerning would be another bugbear..?\r\n\r\nJust
    my two cents,\r\nnagfa"

  body: "Yeah, I did not bother with kerning very well in any of the concepts, and
    I have all but scrapped every concept besides #1 as of now. Currently, I am really
    veering towards stacking Infinity on top of Advertising. Now it can sport an infinity
    loop next to it like #7, or just have a disembodied loop somewhere else. I will
    try and explore your suggestions tomorrow, Nagfa, and thank you for the feedback,
    MrKikkoman.\r\n\r\nThere's three variations of this and all of them have to do
    with the slants and spacing of the legs of the A and the V. I've also altered
    the R to be more solid and less top heavy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3-ia-concepts_3510.png]"

  body: I think the wider 'a' works if you want to go with this approach. However,
    I think you can try shortening the length of the 'a'. It seems unbalanced right
    now to me because of it. Also, it looks like the kerning improved.

  body: "I like #3 of your latest post the most. By stacking both words, the little
    cuts in 'N' and 'Y' get emphazised in a very likable way. Nevertheless I think
    that 'ADVERTISING' is too tight. Allthough it is part of the company name it is
    also the name of the branch and therefore I would like to see it slightly thinner
    and looser and if necessary also smaller in size.\r\n\r\nRegarding to your older
    versions: #2 looks really conflicting. #3--#6 are unnecessarily hard to read.
    #7 looks boring compared to your latest approach.\r\n\r\nKeep on working on your
    current version. I can really understand your thoughts on long company names and
    the difficulty of reproducing them in a good logo. I think you are on the right
    way.\r\n\r\nBtw: The symbol is great. Maybe try to increase the size of the letters
    -- maybe they are already perfect ... I'm not very sure about this."

  body: "MrKikkoman \u2014\_you are right, I worked on the kerning. Thanks for that
    observation. (: I feel what you mean about the A's stem being so extreme and I'll
    give a shot at shortening it.\r\n\r\nSimplicious \u2014 thank you for the feedback.
    Which symbol are you referring to? The IA in the circle? Anyways, I worry about
    spacing out the letters in \"Advertising\" because after resizing, it will all
    but disappear underneath \"Infinity.\" I kerned all the letters when they were
    at the same size and then resized Advertising to go under Infinity. Could this
    be creating a problem?\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, #2 was actually a very fast experiment
    using a thick loop I had originally tried to make as the disembodied, floating
    infinity symbol. It does look super conflicting, but by itself, I was going after
    a serpentine quality. Reasoning behind a poorly prepared concept, hah.\r\n\r\nA
    part of me believes there is a simpler, more minimal approach to all of this hiding
    somewhere still. It's not a big firm. In fact, it's very new. I feel this absolute
    need to reflect a certain amount of freshness about it, and so far the strongest
    inclination I've had has been to pair it down to the essential \"IA\" and nothing
    else. Perhaps I could keep the IA but compliment it next to a different kind of
    logotype where appropriate.\r\n\r\nThank you everyone for the feedback thus far."

  body: "At this moment, I'd like to retry the ligature/y&a loop thing soon. I've
    already come up with a new rough sketch... the problem now is replicating it in
    Illustrator without spending hideous amounts of time on something that may not
    ultimately work. Right now, it looks like an eloquent, slightly-decorative type
    (not all uppercase this time) with drops/foilage on various termini. Think \"Zag\"
    made by FontFabric, only italicized. The y&a ligature looks highly attractive
    and readable in such a style if I do say so myself.\r\n\r\nAs I was sketching,
    I also came up with a way to integrate a lowercase, double-decker \"a\" with an
    infinity loop and the result is very exciting\u2014it's one of those things that
    needs a whole lot of refinement, though it feels like a brand new idea.\r\n\r\nThe
    only disturbing thing about these ideas is that I feel they're both far from being
    \"razor-sharp.\" Perhaps with more fine-tuning. I will try and put up some scans
    tomorrow."

  body: "I'm finding this a little too much show and tell with the word infinity and
    the infinity symbol. I recently drew a similar infinite ligature for a client
    with the word \"ETERNALS\" in the RN slot. At the end of the day we chucked it
    for the same reason, though I think here even more so. It is the obvious solution
    and what does that say about a creative services company?\r\n\r\nIf you do decide
    to keep the infinity symbol (you know your client best), I'd make the word advertising
    way less emphasized. Infinity is the interesting part of this. I might try and
    italic where the f is \"infinite\". Also, consider making any infinite ligatures
    the only modified letters. eg The VE lig is not helping in the slab version above.\r\n\r\nHow
    else can you illustrate infinity? How can you push your client to be more creative?
    \ The IA marks also may have legs."

    can rest mostly dormant underneath, but still there simply for reassurance and
    identity.\r\n\r\nI realize that this project is much like my Apollo Lighting one,
    right down to the illustrative/mythical first name followed by a regular household,
    slightly mundane word with a -ing suffix. Interesting. And the solution is almost
    turning into the same (big, short word with decoration on top of common word)."

    with them, created a memorable mark, and also indicated infinity by using extending
    perspective. Maybe you could push the \"perspective\" concept further. Can the
    letters go on forever in some way? Why is the company called infinity? Their ideas
    stand the test of time? Their creativity has no limit? Their campaigns print oodles
    of cash for clients? Your logo will never illustrate these concepts sufficiently
    (only they can deliver on this promise), but the answers may inform your solution
    as you look for a metaphor or direction.\r\n\r\n<em>right down to the illustrative/mythical

  body: "Alright, here's an idea, and before you say anything, I know it looks horrible,
    there's no real form to the lettering, no contrast, mismatched termini, bad kerning,
    and who knows if Univers is a good match at this early stage, but... first time
    doing custom script with my new Wacom. Biggest question in my mind: is this a
    concept worth pursuing and perfecting?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-1_4439.png]\r\n\r\nBear
    in mind, this is my first time doing something freeform like this. In the past
    it's always been about altering fonts slightly, getting tricky with the pathfinder,
    et cetera, but this, I feel, is a very slick direction, but it's something I need
    to learn more of.\r\n\r\nI want to exaggerate the loops on the I and Y a little
    more so that the eye connects them. There's a buttload of refinement needed for
    this concept if I go for it. Needs so much contrast and stroke work...\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Ah, very good observation, Randy. Have to admit that I did not even mean to go
    for a \"perspective\" with those points. Now you have me thinking \"warp speed\"
    and stuff. And as far as what the client intends with \"Infinity\"... you know,
    that was never disclosed in the brief. Realizing that the ball is very much in
    my court.\r\n\r\nSince it's so relatively new and their first project is still
    being produced, I'm not sure if I can give away anything about this company. But
    I can say that it's brand new and it aims to be a contender in NYC. I think I
    suggested that it be an umbrella company, tying together different firms and divisions
    devoted to different sorts of advertising. And I know the loop is soooo obvious,
    but the idea of making connections (between consumers and businesses) prevailed
    in my mind, yet advertising is a never-ending process (thus the loops in my concepts
    have ends that never meet, but look as if they are about to).\r\n\r\nConceptualizing
    a meaning behind the name, now. This is getting very interesting."
