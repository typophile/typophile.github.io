  body: Close enough, but I don&#39;t think so neither. Anyone knows  <BR>if this
    is a logo or if there are other known uses with a  <BR>complete character set?
    We might be looking at a custom  <BR>logo which would be heavily based on Deadhistory.
    <BR> <BR>BTW Fogfish if you don&#39;t necessarily need to faithfully  <BR>recreate
    the logo but want to use a typeface in that  <BR>style and spirit, Deadhistory
    IS a perfect candidate.

  body: I could look like a regular serif face <BR>where certain serifs have been
    trimmed <BR>off and the M flipped and so on to  <BR>achive that Deadhistory look.
    <BR> <BR>It might be easier to identify if the  <BR>image was a little bit bigger.
    At least <BR>on this crummy old plastic screen I am <BR>looking at.
