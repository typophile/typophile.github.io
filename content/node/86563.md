  Eurostile)? I know there's a specialized geometry term for the shape you get when
  you take a bezier ellipse and pull the handles out as far as they'll go, as if you're
  trying to turn the ellipse into a square.\r\n\r\nIt's not \"ellipsoid,\" but it's
  something like that. Any ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_4691.jpg]"

    is the more accurate one. The whole point of figuring out the word, though, was
    to sound more technical and intelligent, and \"squircle\" doesn't really help
    me much there..."

  body: "It's probably not that simple.\r\nI had always thought Microgramma was CRT-tube
    inspired, but it seems to be much squarer than the tubes of that time.\r\nWho
    knows, it may even have some De Stijl in it.\r\nWhatever, it was very carefully
    and subtly drawn, and that seems to be a hallmark of the types of the immediate
    post WW2 era.\r\nNo doubt the designers were aware that their types would be on
    display at large sizes, reproduced by phototypositor."
