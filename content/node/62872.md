  body: Ya, I've spent all day on MyFonts trying to find that or something similar.
    I think you're right about it being custom. Avant Garde is a good alternative.
    Thanks.

  body: The "R" reminds me of the "B" from <a href="http://www.alias.uk.com/progress_frameset.html">Progress
    Thin</a> by Alias. Not exact but similar type of feel.
