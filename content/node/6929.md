body: 'ok, i&#39;ve just encountered a small bit of OT wierdness, that, being a generous
  guy, thought i&#39;d share. <BR> <BR>so i created some text in illy cs. the text
  included had some proportional oldstyle numerals set in an OT font. i printed it
  to pdf &#40;as an illy editable file&#41;. all fine &amp; dandy.  <BR> <BR>then
  i tried to select the text and paste it from the pdf into an HTML email.no joy:
  i got lots of little boxes. that&#39;s the first odd thing. <BR> <BR>then, looking
  for a work-around, i opened the pdf in illy. all fine. tried to paste text from
  illy into same email. lots of little boxes. <BR> <BR>finally, with a growing sense
  of disorientation, i changed the font in illy, from the OT font to another OT font.
  the numbers displayed fine, but still wouldn&#39;t paste out of the doc. i then
  changed the font to a non opentype font, and I actually got a string of question
  marks in illy. <BR> <BR>i don&#39;t understand why the glyphs haven&#39;t been correctly
  substituted:/ <BR> <BR>to quote charlie parker: &#39;what in the WOOURLD is wrong
  here with ma opentype?&#39;  <BR> <BR>any pointers appreciated.'

  body: i think you figgered it out - the glyphs have probably been named incorrectly.
    but let&#39;s wait to hear from an expert on the subject to see if that&#39;s
    truly the case...

    <BR> <BR>What version of Acrobat are you using to view and copy the text with?
    <BR> <BR>Do OpenType fonts from Adobe show the same problem, or not? <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T

  body: hi thomas, <BR> <BR>all the files i referred to above were generated using
    Adobe CS, so that&#39;ll be acrobat 6. <BR> <BR>when i open the above file &#40;wha_-50143&#41;
    in illustrator &#40;v11&#41;, the numerals on the left-hand column display correctly
    with any OT font &#40;adobe or otherwise&#41;. when i try to convert them to a
    non-OT font, the numerals are replaced by question marks &#40;see right-hand column.  <BR>
    <BR>it&#39;s the same if i copy and paste the text into MS word, for example.
    numbers are good in OT fonts, but get those box placeholder glyphs in non-OT.
    i&#39;m running win2000 professional. <BR> <BR>thanks for your help. hope things
    are good in prague! <BR> <BR>geraint

  body: just for kicks, i tried the steps i described in my first post with myriad
    pro &#40;opentype&#41;. same setup, thats Adobe CS on win2000 pro. <BR> <BR>1.
    set proportional oldstyle numbers in illustrator using myriad pro. <BR>2. paste
    from illy into notepad. glyphs convert fine into courier. <BR>3.print to pdf,
    and paste from there into notepad.glyphs convert fine into courier. <BR>4.open
    pdf in illy and paste from illy into notepad. get boxes. <BR> <BR>my ignorance
    should be clear by now, but nevertheless, i&#39;d be much oblidged if anyone could
    explain the result in step 4. is it a pdf thing?
