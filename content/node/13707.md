body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Johann Gutenberg</strong>\r\n\r\nA man
  of mystery. Sadly, very little is known about him. His real name was probably <strong>Johannes
  Gensfleisch zur Laden</strong>, but he most likely went by a series of nicknames,
  such as \"Henchen\" or \"Elle\". \"Gutenberg\" was the name of one of his family's
  houses within the city of [[Mainz]], [[Germany]].\r\n\r\nBorn into an aristocratic
  family, Gutenberg was not an aristocrat himself (his father married a commoner).
  It is not known when Gutenberg was born. Around [[1900]], the city of Mainz decreed
  his birthdate to have fallen in June [[1400]], allowing them to throw a big summer
  party in his honor. Gutenberg died in [[1468]] in Eltville, up the Rhein from Mainz.\r\n\r\nAs
  a young man, Gutenberg left Mainz for Strasbourg, in present-day [[France]]. Sometime
  before [[1450]], he moved back home. Gutenberg  worked as a goldsmith and became
  skilled in the casting of finite amounts of metal. Either in Strasbourg or Mainz,
  between ca. [[1440]] and [[1450]], Gutenberg invented the idea of printing with
  movable [[type]] in the west. He invented a way to cast individual letters cheaply,
  and also a means to [[printing|print]] them (an probably the [[ink]] used, too!).\r\n\r\nHis
  first printed work was a Latin grammar. Later, he borrowed money to begin work on
  the first of a series of Bibles, the B42 (or 42-line Bible). He also printed indulgences,
  and a sort of proto-encyclopedia.\r\n\r\nThese major works were printed in Mainz,
  even if printing was not \"invented\" there. Gutenberg also had a studio in [[Frankfurt]]
  during his busiest years, were he farmed out some of the production work.\r\n\r\nAround
  the year [[2000]], Gutenberg was voted \"Man of the Millenium\" by an international
  panel of scientists.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive [[Gutenberg Museum]] in Mainz,
  which has three original Gutenberg Bibles in its collection.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
