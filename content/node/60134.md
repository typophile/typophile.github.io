  Bold]] but the uppercase R is off. It's either another font or a custom R that doesn't
  appear in the MyFonts glyph previews. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot-42_5968.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot-37_4365.gif]"

  body: Yes, I agree Jan, it definitely appears to be Horatio, but is that a custom
    u/c R? Horatio's leg is different. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/cr_6124.gif]

  body: I believe Jan's right, and I think the freeware font in question is [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=962|SF
    Atarian System]]. The italic version is shown in the preview; I downloaded the
    whole package and found the Rs in the non-italic fonts are similar to those in
    the original post.

    a small company like Universal Pictures to come up with the cash needed to buy
