  animated characters? I mean, it's the bleeding 21st century, where are the \"fully
  animated\" script fonts that scrawl beautiful handwriting from the late eighteenth
  century, complete with ink effects, before your very eyes? How long will it take
  to develop the technology? How long will it take type designers to make one \"fully

    make a \"fully animated feature font\" that runs for 90 minutes! In the future
    there will be more than movies made about fonts --- \"feature fonts\" will rival
    movies for audience share. \r\n\r\nThe task of developing an animated font format
    is comparable to the difficulty experienced by a small cat rolling a large watermelon
    ashore on the Ivory Coast.\r\n\r\nTypography will become a performance art and
    typographers will become more like actors. The really experienced type designers

  body: "<strong>Sample Motion Picture Font Quiz</strong>\r\n\r\n1) What features
    would you most like to see in the animated font format of the future?\r\n\r\n2)
    Should motion picture fonts have sound? Maybe that will come later.\r\n\r\n3)
    In the early days of silent motion picture fonts, Ray Larabie had big hits with
    which font comedies?\r\n(a) The Bold Rush\r\n(b) A Funny Thing Happened on the
    Way to the Font Forum\r\n(c) Take The Money Fonts and Run\r\n(d) Eth Girls are
    Easy\r\n\r\n4) Which prodigiously talented female lettering artist of our time
    would you have make The Caron Carpenter Story into a feature length font?\r\n\r\n5)
    Which legendary type designers would you sign for The Caslons of War? My money
    is on Gerald Giampa to direct, with Sumner Stone on second unit and Brian J. Bonislawskyi
    directing special visual effects.\r\n\r\n6) The Caslons of War won oscars for
    which categories?\r\n(a) Least Contrived Art Direction\r\n(b) Best Supporting
    Serif\r\n(c) Sturdiest Crossbar in a lead role\r\n(d) Worst Ink Detail in a Historical
    Font\r\n\r\n7) Most of the money in motion picture font production wiil be in
    commercial lettering capable of block-buster style special effects and tranformations.
    Unlike feature length fonts, advertising lettering will only run a few minutes
    and be cheaply produced from stock libraries. The lucrative Adobe stock libraries
    are culled from which feature length fonts?\r\n(a) Futura Cop\r\n(b) The Ball
    Terminator\r\n(c) Children of the Kern\r\n(d) Hrant & the Masters of the Univers\r\n\r\n8)
    When riots brought shooting of the first 3D feature font Dial M for Murga to a
    halt, the font's director Harold Lohner was heard to mutter which exasperated
    turn of phrase?\r\n(a) Oh brother where art Downer?\r\n(b) Die deresis die!\r\n(c)
    Please don't eat the accents.\r\n(d) Whatever happened to Baby J?\r\n\r\n9) Which
    gritty motion picture font about the big apple won the 2034 academy award for
    Best Inktraps?\r\n(a) Manhatten(schweiler)\r\n(b) The Side Bearings of New York\r\n(c)
    Font Apache the Bronx\r\n(d) The Purple Rows of Biro\r\n\r\n10) I've used up two
    fonty-flavoured film titles on one font already. The ill-fated Citizen Kern had
    to be rechristened Midnight Kernboy to avoid trademark conflict with Zuzana Licko's
    Citizen. Name one other font christened after a motion picture film that had to
    be remonikered because of trademark conflict with Berthold's City font.\r\n\r\nj
