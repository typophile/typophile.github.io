body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nAlthough I frequently browse through these forums my contribution
  to them is still scarce. But I enjoyed making this 'typeface' so much I wanted to
  share it with you. Hopefully you can give me some feedback to improve it.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a monoline sans with quite a few (discretionary) ligatures, it was inspired by the
  ligatures in Avant Garde Gothic (alternates). It misses optical correction and inktraps
  at the moment and that will cause 'darker spots', might address those in the future.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\nAttachments;\r\n<em>monoline_sans_serif_ligatures.pdf</em> shows the
  original design\r\n<em>monoline_alice.pdf</em> updated letterforms and ligatures
  per 05/13/2009"

  body: "Your work is interesting. This, because it has, for example the fact of particular
    ligatures which are not very common.\r\nIn my opinion, there are some ligatures
    that are working better than others.\r\ns_a and s_o are better than s_c and s_e.\r\nDespite
    the fact the first pairs I've mentioned need a bit of optical correction as regards
    to their connections (a more fluid curve), they are much better than s_e for example.\r\nThis
    one is a bit forced yet, I mean, the sharp edge of the \"e\" is not working ok
    with the meeting. Maybe you should make \"e\"'s eye smaller, so the curve of the
    connection with the s should be longer.\r\nI also think \"g\" should have a curve
    instead of that sharp part you are including on its tail. Your type is very curvy,
    the \"g\" is not following that parameter yet.\r\nWell, hope this helps!\r\nBest!
    and good luck!\r\n\r\nLi\xE1n Types.-"

  body: "The f- ligatures are most graceful of all in terms of structure (though they
    might need more spacing between the ligated letters). I agree that the g's tail
    needs rethinking. \r\n\r\nThis is a funky idea and I think if you can get it to
    work you'd wind up with a pretty interesting font."

  body: "Thank you both for your comments.\r\n\r\nThe s_c and the s_e do need some
    work. I believe the s_e can be saved, but am not sure of the s_c. I'm afraid it
    will keep looking like an s_e. Here are some alternatives to the s_e;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monoline_sevens_5536.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    is the original, II has a more fluid curve without making the eye of the e smaller,
    III is a more fluid curve with a smaller eye & IV is a curvy e where I tried to
    maintain the same size eye as the original \u2014 I think I like option IV the
    most but am not sure if it is too big a difference from the normal e.\r\n\r\nThis
    'hard' g is actually an alternative I had drawn at a later stage, I liked it more
    than the curvy, original g. But this was before I added a lot of the ligatures
    which changed the overall feel of the font. Here are both;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monoline_magemagic_5937.jpg]"

    made since first pdf;\r\n\r\na - added two-story a, will keep original as alternative\r\nb/q
    - removed kickstand/ear\r\ng - curvy tail, option IV of two posts up\r\ne - is
    now curvy, will keep original as alternative\r\ny - redrawn to a more regular
    design\r\n\r\nto do;\r\n- Add more space in s_* ligatures\r\n- Widen small caps

  body: "My friend, \r\nive just been watching the pdf, and got to this conclusion:\r\ns
    - needs adjustment on its superior left part, i mean, i can see a sharp connection
    of it with the middle part.\r\n\r\nt- has too much base. Maybe you should make
    it more \"condensed\", less base. the word you use: contemptuous, shows it: the
    inferior part of that t is giving kerning problems as a result.\r\n\r\nligature
    b_r has a similiar problems (the s problem), it still needs to be softer, i can
    see a sharp connection when it curves abruptly to ligate the r.\r\n\r\nSame with
    g_r, the g has a little sharp mountain on its top, be careful.\r\n\r\nAs regards
    the curvy e, and its ligatures, they are better! But, also make it a bit more
    fluid.\r\nThe e, (the new one) should be more fluid on that new part of the eye.\r\n\r\ny-
    looks pro! congratulations, that one is very well done ;)\r\n\r\nBest, and good
    luck!\r\n\r\nLi\xE1n Types.-\r\n"
