  in the center. used neo tech which I modified a little. Let me know what you think[img:sites/default/files/old-images/THRIVE_5322.png]

  body: "Interesting. It feels rather fresh and definitely not \"dusty\", which religious
    groups don't often manage to do (to my perception at least).\r\nThat said, it
    also feels surprisingly cold, techy and corporate (and a bit Web 2.0), mostly
    because of the type (and type color). \"Thrive\" is a great name \u2013 hmm, it
    would seem to warrant a little more movement, a little more liveliness \u2013
    the premise of [inner] growth, a bit of sparkle* and joy and life, no? At the
    moment it seems a bit\u2026 dead. The absence of the tittle doesn't help.\r\n(*
    You do have a bit of that in the leaf/cross mark, which I think is quite nice.)\r\n\r\nIt
    would be cool to learn a little more about this group. Is it a \"real-life\" community?
    Or an online thing? What are common activities, goals? Do you feel the \"tone\"
    of the logo matches what they do, how they work?"

  body: I really like the type with an exception of V's bend. The inner curve is too
    sharp IMO.

  body: "The mark is very nice. The type could be explored further. Needs more personality
    to keep it from being cold and 'techy' as altaira said. The crossbar and foot
    on the 't' are too thin and yes, the 'i' needs its tittle.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: I think the typeface is quite attractive, and the i doesn't need a tittle
    in my opinion, as it would ruin the pure look of it a bit (however, it would make
    it more dynamic, which is desired). I think the symbol is wonderful, but very
    cold indeed. I would probably use that symbol but add some sparkles around it
    in a dynamic composition (but don't make a sparkle-cloud), and change the color
    from emerald to orange/yellow, and position the symbol centered above the text.
