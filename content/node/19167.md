body: "Hey Everyone, I have been tasked with developing a new magazine... from scratch
  (pause) and I need some help with font choices.\r\nHere is a short hand version
  of the project:\r\n\r\nMetro-style magazine\r\nLifestlye and arts focus\r\nclean
  text blocks\r\nlargely photo-driven\r\nPublished in WV (believe it or not)\r\n\r\nWhat
  I need from my fonts:\r\n\r\nSerif family - Reasonable sans mate\r\nNo more than
  about 3 familys altogether\r\nfresh look (Not garamond, or TNR)\r\nOTF please, with
  SC, Ligs and Con. Alts.\r\nTitle, Subheads, callouts, captions, the WORKS\r\n\r\nHow
  I will be abusing them:\r\n\r\n10/12  w/ -10/1000 letterspacing\r\n8/9 captions\r\nJustified...
  less hyphens.\r\nI will figure the rest out when I am actually setting them up\r\n\r\nMy
  Boss and Co. Like:\r\nGaramond\r\nAkzidenz Grotesk\r\nCaecilia\r\nand a whole pantheon
  of other specimens I showed them = clueless.\r\n\r\nPlease, I know that this is
  alot of info, but you can live vicariously through me and pick anything you want,
  as I have an unlimited font budget(up to $300, LOL)\r\n\r\nFeel free to pimp your
  own work, or your friends, or your moms... :) TIA"

    would look beautiful (san serif wise), but it's $200 for 1 workstation. <a href=http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/>Klavika</a>
    would also be nice for display. Serif-wise, <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Proforma">Proforma</a>
    is pritty "fresh".

    I'm thinking a Fleischmann would go well with the\r\ntopic and contrast well with
    your \"clean text blocks\".\r\nhttp://www.typographer.org/2005_06_01_digests.html#111945232557055739

  body: "Your budget will force you to be very picky. Anything from H&FJ will be cost
    prohibitive since they don't sell single weights.\r\n\r\nI like Hrant's suggestion
    of a Fleischmann-based design. Take a look at Farnham:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham\r\n\r\nWhitman
    is also nice, but has a more limited weight range:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman\r\n\r\nSome
    sans serifs for headlines/subheads:\r\n\r\nBenton Sans\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans\r\n\r\nAgenda\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda\r\n\r\nNobel\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel\r\n\r\nThese
    are very safe recommendations, and may not be distinctive enough, but there you
    have my 2 cents. Good luck."

    although, the yet-to-be-released OT version will probably be over your budget,
    leaving nothing for a sans counterpart. >^/

  body: "A coordinated family like Freight.... Solves all problems at all sizes. Pick
    the size variants you need. Arnhem is also nice for this reason. Or, X. Dupre's
    new Absara and Absara Sans.\r\n\r\nI have to ask, why are you talking about negative
    tracking your text before you even have the type selected? Very few text fonts
    are spaced too widely to begin with. I would expect you to open the spacing of
    a normal text face for use at caption size. \r\n"

  body: "FANTASTIC suggestions everyone, I have examined most of them, but I will
    be re-examining them this week. My boss is carrying around the sheet of the C\xE6cilia
    sheets that I printed, I am going to try to pry them from his fingers...as I don't
    believe that is what I am looking for exactly. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the negative
    tracking spec is that when I am showing sheets, they keep using the words tighter.
    I have C\xE6cilia set at 9/10.2 and -25/1000 tracking... and it may still be not
    enough. It is killing me. \r\n\r\nSo far, I have liked the Fleischmann revivals
    alot, but I am not sure the x-height is what I need, since they keep talking smaller.
    I downloaded a pdf of it, and will be printing it tommorow. ( I LOVE TYPE SPECIMENS
    ) Thanks, everyone... your thoroughness and dilligence is much appreciated. I
    will be sure and post a proof of the *finished* product. I have to get my \xE6ss
    to work\r\n\r\nOh yeah, Stefan, thanks for pimpin' and for Hattrick... what is
    the license on that anyway? I converted it to PC TT and would like to use it on
    my site... "

    There's only so much economy you can squeeze out of the type before you're making
    things difficult for the reader.

    font originally intended for small sizes,\r\nalthough then it's likely to look
    too dark when set larger.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
