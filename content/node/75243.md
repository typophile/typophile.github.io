    by [[Paul Barnes]] of [[Commercial Type]], but that one is not available. See
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/matchandkerosene/slab-sheriff/|here]] and [[http://vllg.com/Village/Arbor|here]]
    for available digital interpretations. The latter departs more from the source.

  body: 'frode frank seems to have it right, at least in terms of the origin. Do you
    think this was a wood version or metal? it certainly looks like it was carved. '

  body: The M does look weird, but it follows the rest of the design perfectly - the
    entire contrast is reversed.
