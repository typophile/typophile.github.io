  one.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dolcevita_5921.png]\r\nHowever, I need
  it to be able to automatically swap glyphs. To keep the hand-drawnfeel I need change
  one of  two neighbouring instances of the same glyph. "

    to match called \"sketchnote\"\r\n[[http://www.delvefonts.com/sketchnote.html]]\r\n\r\nIt's
    a lot more hand drawn than your sample, but it is impressive.\r\n\r\n"
