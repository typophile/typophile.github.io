body: "Does anyone actually own Kimera's Lagarto font by abriel Martinez Meave?  Have
  seen it mentioned many times and think it would work for a project I'm on if I could
  track it down (though seeing the face in a demo typesetter would allow me to do
  a mockup enough to confirm).\r\n\r\nHave seen some threads a few years old about
  this and potential \"coming\" places it might be sold, but don't have a firm link
  to try or purchase the font.\r\n\r\nAnyone know?\r\n\r\nWould also possibly be open
  to more easily available alternatives--I think the feel of this font would work
  though. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: I licensed it a few years ago straight from Meave. Just go to the order page
    on kimeratype.com and use the e-mail address there; I'm sure he'll get back to
    you.
