    <BR>Girl Scout Bitch comes in three weights: Sarcastic, Sadistic and Just Plain
    Mean. <BR>also: <BR>&#34;Girls are weird&#34; by Robotic Attack Fonts <BR>and
    all the TarmSaft fonts of course. <BR>translation here: <A HREF="http://tarmsaft.8m.com/introduction.htm"

    got a wicked sense of humor. very irreverent, but a super-nice guy. it&#39;s a
    catchy little concept for sure, but the name i like the most is &#34;wired for
    speed&#34;. i don&#39;t think any mother would want their daughter in a bra wired
    for speed. '
