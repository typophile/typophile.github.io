  typewriter font without slab serifs but looks default for a machine.\r\n\r\nIt would
  be great to find out!\r\nI like the look.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nTakashi\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5vjkyqq31qiyeuko1_500_5263.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5v2p2xqM1qiyeuko1_500_4423.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5v3zJAWD1qiyeuko1_500_5279.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5v4xCsuL1qiyeuko1_500_6493.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5v6iQ90E1qiyeuko1_500_5130.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5vfoGpPY1qiyeuko1_500_6455.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_na5vim7r291qiyeuko1_500_3541.jpg]"

  body: Artwork by [[http://karmakarma.org/tagged/projects|Joe Bradley]]. Firstly
    thought it could be bespoke then reminded me of [[http://typophile.com/node/79271|Leroy
    Lettering machine]] (alternatives [[http://typophile.com/node/114201#comment-571421|here]]).
    To me it looks like some sort of Helvetica Rounded Light with some little adjustements.
    Then, I remembered many non-latin fonts have their latin sub-sets close to "classic"
    typefaces (Helvetica, Optima, Times, Myriad...). Finally, found the Korean language
    font [[http://www.fonts.com/font/hanyang/hy-gothic|HY Gothic]] Rounded (bundled
    with Adobe Font Folio 11) that matches this design.

  body: "Yes Ryuk, it is by Joe Bradley! Good spot.\r\nHY Gothic Rounded is very close
    but I see a different R and G. \r\nDo you know other fonts that could be like
    this to check? A newer version of HY Gothic Rounded with changes? Thank you for
    the suggestions! It is very helpful. "

  body: Sorry Takashi, was too happy to find a close one that I concluded it was it
    too hastily. Sorry for that, many details remain off actually but can't find something
    closer than HY Gothic Rounded. Still searching...

  body: "Ryuk, you are definitely on the right track. \r\n\r\nWhen I searched, I came
    up with a number of Korean and Chinese typefaces that were very close, but not
    quite exact matches (such as Gulim, which comes with the Mac operating system)--and
    nothing closer than HY Gothic Rounded.\r\n\r\n"

    we can't find it...

  body: "Since the artwork consists in etched plastic plaques, and given the kind
    of spacing (see, for example the A-T pair in \"EAT\", my hunch is that it's a
    font that resides in some specialised machine used for custom made plaques, and
    has no direct correspondence with any digital typeface.\r\nAs for general shape
    of letters, the closest I found is AG Rounded."
