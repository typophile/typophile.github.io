  streamline our work process a little better and to make it easier and more thorough
  to hire &amp; train new artists. We have searched everywhere and cannot find anything
  official, or not, for this.  What do your companies &#40;of any size&#41; use to
  standardize your art department and make sure everything gets done properly? We
  want it to be all inclusive and include things from e-mail and file format procedures,
  to documenting procedures, and everything in between. Even if you have tidbits,
  we could combine &amp; edit them to create an overall manual. Please HELP me!  What
  does eveyone use for this?!?!  '

    combination of personal experience and knowledge, a bit of <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/tools/manuals.html">stuff
    gleaned from other groups</a>, and a generous dash of logic and a willingness
    to experiment. <BR> <BR>Really, it&#39;s more about having a comprehensive view
    of what you want to do, and then writing it all down. Then, to make a guide, you
    distill it all to its core elements, with an eye towards the end-users &#40;designers&#41;.
    I know this sounds like a lot of high-level talk, but it&#39;s true. <BR> <BR>In
    terms of day-to-day job process, there are many models to choose from. A lot of
    it depends on whether you have/need a traffic manager &#40;or &#39;controller&#39;&#41;
    to manage the flow of jobs. Do you want your CD to be in the center &#40;all jobs
    pass through them and are proofed by them&#41; or do you want them to exercise
    a more casual autonomy &#40;they monitor jobs at their leisure&#41;? <BR> <BR>What
    you&#39;re asking for is pretty big, and also tends to be specific to the people/
    jobs/ environment. I can&#39;t go into too much detail &#40;I&#39;m at work right
    now&#41;, but I&#39;d first break the project into A&#41; style guide B&#41; process
    guide C&#41; roles and responsibilities D&#41; Resources and capabilities. This
    might make it easier to understand and to manage. <BR> <BR>I do not run my own
    company &#40;I work at one and freelance&#41;, but the one I&#39;m in did a <i>major</i>
    process overhaul and a bit of a rebrand recently, so I&#39;m drawing from these
    experiences.'

    <BR>This may help with business to business procedures. &#40;Some clients insist
    on dealing only with accredited companies.&#41;  <BR> <BR>As for a manual/procedure
    for internal use this is best developed through experience. Setting a standard
    for a job that can be applied to all jobs, for example &#40;this is for print
    but can be adapted&#41;, create a folder for each client, then, for each job create
    a folder which contains your final artwork file &#40;Quark or InDesign&#41; with
    folders containing collateral &#40;vector files, Photoshop files, fonts, pdfs
    sent to client, old versions of the job&#41;. If you have a job number system
    use this to name the folder &#40;1234 '

    how to do everything &#40;we do it all pretty much exactly like you just said,
    Tim&#41;.  What we are really looking for is a  document/manual that covers a
    much broader range: all different types of jobs &amp; procedures--from things
    that come up every day, to things that only come up a few times a year.  Of course
    we realize we will have to customize this to us.  We are really looking for more
    of a template or example that we can adapt to our firm that might include things
    we might have forgotten, instead of us just writing it as we go and adding things
    as we think of them. I know this is a big thing to ask for, but surely some company
    out there has a document of this sort? One that is all inclusive that we could
    change and tweak to fit different firms? '

  body: Oh, boy -- 2 designers and a creative director? IMO spare yourself the huge
    task of creating a piece such as you describe and let your CD simply instruct
    the designers on a personal level. Anything you commit to print could end up a
    nightmare, or at best paint you into a corner. I would go to print only as a last
    resort. I speak from experience as Polaroid&#39;s first design director who set
    up their art and production departments. Top brass wanted style manuals but we
    were too busy to do one.  <BR>

    a great deal of helpful information @ CreativePublic.com.  They have an amazing
    amount of forms, template, and manuals that you can get unlimited access to for
    a membership fee...
