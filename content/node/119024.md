  Illustrator and wonder what options, preferably free, are out there for creating
  a font with these icons.\r\n\r\nI also wonder how the font technology handles small
  size characters. When I scale down a vector graphic to a very small size there is
  a point at which the vector graphic becomes unrecognizable but at certain small
  sizes if I put the vector paths manually at certain places on the screen pixels
  the graphic look much better and clear than automatic scaling to the same size.
  Many years ago, I remember reading about font technology and learning that some
  fonts may contain a bit map raster images of the characters which are used at smaller
  sizes, is this still the case, and something that I should do when creating a font?\r\n\r\nI
  will greatly appreciate your help\r\n\r\nGS"
