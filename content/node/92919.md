  body: "Perhaps that letters that are still cap form (/ONS/ sticks out in hamburgefonstiv)
    aren't \"uncialed\" enough? /S/ could be wider, and I would even try a top-heavy
    version (as you see in some insular scripts). /N/ could have a serif-life extension
    of the diagonal at lower right instead of the neat angle (or what about a humped
    form more akin to /m/?)\r\n\r\nMaybe move the join of /T/ further right?\r\n\r\nDescending
    beard of /G/ could use some strengthening.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about the
    other scripts to comment on specifics but they look nice!"

    a big torso.\r\n\r\nCraig, thanks for your comments. Youre certainly right upon
    the t (this is always a tricky one). I\u2019ll see what to do with the others."
