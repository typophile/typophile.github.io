  alt="ol"> <BR> <BR>i&#39;m looking for critique on this, even i haven&#39;t done
  it, but we are going to start a campaign against this logo and for a new logo...
  so i like to hear your critique on this one. for info: <BR>the yelow back stands
  for a horseshoe &#40;please don&#39;t ask why it&#39;s upsidedown... i have no idea&#41;.
  the claim &#34;das hat was&#34; translates something like &#34;that got something&#34;
  &#40;sounds as wrong as the german original &#42;g&#42;&#41;. please help us to
  collect some creative critique on this one ... nearly no one in oldenburg likes
  it. thanks: lars <BR>'

    change? <BR> <BR>What does your town do? What is its identity? <BR>What is the
    environment and weather like? <BR> <BR>Thats what I would start thinking about
    on a redesign. I dont know anything about Oldenburg. <BR>I&#39;ll google it. <BR>

    &#40;which does not have an english version - worth another campaign &#42;g&#42;&#41;
    or <a href="http://www.oldenburg-tourist.de" target="_blank">www.oldenburg-tourist.de</a>  <BR>
    <BR>it&#39;s up the north of germany, a university city, quite green, 155.000
    citizens, about 650 years old, near the north sea, near to the netherlands ...

  body: The oldenburg.de panoramas are a nice inspiration. There is lot of good color
    and texture the stripes on the awnings the lush greens, the brickwork. Collage
    some of these elements into the letters of Oldenburg? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking
    about Milton Glasers illustration&#39;s and logo&#39;s for inspiration.

  body: 'My critique is that it looks hugely dated already- quite alot like a random
    telecom or .com from the 90&#39;s not like a city. The idea may have been to be
    hip or something but from a tourism point of view I don&#39;t think it will help.
    It seems like a sensitive re-treatment of something with more historical gravitas
    could lend an air of the contemporary while keeping in touch with history. This
    design is also hard to read due to the arbitrary colored &#39;OL&#39; so it&#39;s
    1st duty is not met - to label or idenitify. <BR> <BR>It really is monsterous.
    Good luck killing it off. '

  body: If I am role playing as the tourist, it doesn&#39;t tell me anything at all.
    There is nothing there to attract me. As an English speaking American tourist
    I see &#34;OL&#34; and &#34;DENBURG&#34;, which reads as &#34;Ole Denburg&#34;
    or &#34;Old Denburg&#34;. I saw the yellow horseshoe as a cropped &#34;O&#34;
    graphic representing the &#34;O&#34; in &#34;Oldenburg&#34;. In relation to a
    location, I&#39;m not getting the personality of the town/city from the logo.
    It looks like a bad identity for a shopping mall

  body: Whats bugging me is the D against the yellow horseshoe makes it shrink compared
    to ENBURG, the net effect it looks like three different size typefaces. The slogan
    makes no sense.

  body: 'At the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, they recently had an exhibit
    of the artist Romare Bearden. His mural for Berkeley California had a element
    that was taken out as a logo for the city. <a href="http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/civicarts/registry/R-Bearden.htm"
    target="_blank">Here</a> you can see unfortunately tiny versions of the mural
    and logo. The original mural and the element taken out as a logo are powerful.
    I imagine that a bit bigger the logo would be very good, but I don&#39;t know.
    <BR> <BR>The original element is a profile of the four peoples involved in the
    city - Native Americans, and those with ancestry in Africa, Europe, and China.
    All four profiles are iconic and respectful, rather than caricatures. <BR> <BR>I
    would think that ideally a city logo would have this kind of strength and historical
    associations.  <BR> <BR> '

  body: Below is a collage of a few city seals/logos that I collected from California.
    I don&#39;t know if this is done nationwide, but most cities in California have
    a unique seal/logo. Very few of these seals are done well. Believe it or not these
    are some of the better ones. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26085.jpg"
    alt="City Seals"> <BR> <BR>Hopefully, you&#39;ll be able to use these in your
    argument for Oldenburg. If not, you may consider going to a larger government
    body and pursuing a larger volume of work by selling this same type of identity
    campaign that California has. Initiate a nationwide identity campaign where each
    city has its own seal, or the equivelent. <BR> <BR>Similarly, the US is implementing
    a program where each state has its own coin &#40;25 cent quarter&#41;. These types
    of programs are appealing to the central government and the individual states.
    It allows states to identify their unique character and pride, but it does so
    on a centrally/federally controlled medium. Uniformity allowing for individuality
