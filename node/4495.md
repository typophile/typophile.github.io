    target="_blank">Burweed</a>, which I was convinced came with an Adobe program,

  body: <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?7TQ">Burweed</a> is originally from
    the Image Club Typeface Library, which at one time was owned by Adobe. This weight
    of it was distributed along with a few other Image Club faces on a sampler disc
    included with many Adobe applications in the mid-90s. The Image Club library is
    now owned by <a href="http://www.fonts.com/fontpackages/packs_home.asp?nCo=AFMT&amp;con=imageclub">Agfa</a>
