body: "I am concerned about the Marketplace \"Fairness\" Act undermining our industry.
  It is simply a grab for additional revenue. I have written and phoned my Congressman
  and Senator.\r\n\r\nAlthough the act has caps on the size of certain businesses,
  Myfonts and our other distributors would be effected, which, in turn means our customers
  will be impacted. I've written this letter, and I urge you to adapt it and send
  it to your representatives.\r\n\r\nDear Senator or Congressman,\r\n\r\nI ask that
  you oppose the Marketplace Fairness Act (S. 336/H.R.684). As a small business owner,
  I am sympathetic to brick and mortar vendors who often see customers come in, peruse
  products and then purchase them cheaper online. \r\n\r\nMy issue with this legislation
  is that government will simply take and misuse the money. Instead of plugging holes
  and endeavoring to greater efficiency, they will simply take the windfall and find
  new ways to waste it. Every dollar that is taken from the American taxpayer is one
  less dollar that a hard working taxpayer that earned it can spend. Taxpayers should
  have the choice to use their money in the way that they see fit. \r\n\r\nThe Marketplace
  Fairness Act is inherently immoral because it destroys the choices of the taxpayers.
  It is theft. I urge you in the strongest terms possible to oppose it.\r\n\r\nSales
  taxes are supposed to be used to offset public resources that are consumed in the
  process of business. The Internet does not have these costs, so any tax is not to
  offset the consumption of resources, it is simply an abusive grab for additional
  money.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, an amendment should be included that does not tax
  the sale of software or other digital products. Although I doubt this is the case,
  if the purpose of this legislation is truly to balance the competitiveness of brick
  and mortar and internet based business, digital products that are exclusively sold
  on the Internet should not fall under this Act and should be exempted.\r\n\r\nThe
  government also has a role to protect property, a role which it has abysmally failed
  at in the digital realm. Instead, the government wants to tax something and offer
  nothing in return. With my physical property, I can at least trust the police to
  open an investigation after the theft of my product, but with intellectual property
  instead I'm the one who is forced to do all of the work to track down intellectual
  property thieves.\r\n\r\nI am a young man, I notice that many of the professionals
  of my age are sick and tired of a government that does nothing for them but takes
  everything.\r\n\r\nIf you want to ensure that the United States loses its competitive
  edge in the coming century the Marketplace Fairness Act is a good way to start.
  I urge you in the strongest terms to oppose it. This issue is so important to me,
  if you do not oppose this act, regardless of the outcome, I will actively oppose
  you, and will vote for your opponents in primaries and in the general election,
  regardless of their position, to punish you for this vote. Don\u2019t let government
  taxation expand into the cyberrealm.\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley"
