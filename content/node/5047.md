    of the many Caslon variants</a> available digitally. There are definite discrepancies
    beyond the obvious customization for this logo. I doubt you&#39;ll find a version
    that has an A and Z like this. This may have been optically widened, too.

  body: In addition, the whole thing may have been done from scratch, based on Caslon,
    given the extensive customizing and the amount of money that was likely available
    for this project.
