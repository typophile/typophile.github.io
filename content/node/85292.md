body: "Hello,\r\nTo most, this question might be incredibly basic. \r\nFirst, I'm
  using Fontographer (ie: no [open type] features window)\r\nSecond, I've created
  all my glyphs that I want to program actions to, so this is my last step.\r\nI've
  tried accessing and modifying features from existing fonts in a demo version of
  FontLab but it never properly outputs my font with the same \"OpenType font cannot
  be generated due to an error in feature-definition file.\" But the .fea I've tried
  in the past was taken straight from Adobe Garamond Pro (not that I would have published
  someone else's feature code, just a test) \u2014 same result.\r\n\r\nIts a fair
  amount of features I'd like available in the font I've created: some case sensitive
  punctuation, numerals, small caps, & ligatures.\r\n\r\nWhat options do I have to
  learn more about this to just punch it out. Seems like basic language but its just
  not going through. This isn't something I haven't done a bit of research on initially:
  I'm posting now to get some more in-depth answers.\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance
  everyone."

    your font is missing?

  body: "Yeah, could totally be the case: along with some of the exact glyph names.\r\nOnce
    I just tried some basic ligatures. Seemed pretty standard to try: \"when f f then
    f_f\" etc. But that didn't go through.\r\nSome of the Robofab jive seems like
    it could work  but its a little over my head and a bit unnecessary since its mostly
    available through FontLab options."

  body: "Don't start with OpenType features by using a big feature file ripped from
    a complex font. Make your own feature file, adding features and relevant classes
    one at a time, testing each one as you go. But if you generate test fonts directly
    into the Adobe application fonts folder it's a pretty quick process.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Adobe has provided some great documentation in the form of the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\">OpenType
    Feature File Specification.</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>FF generates necessary (empty) slots

    generating fonts with empty characters just to make bad code compile is better
    than refusing to compile the bad code in the first place."

  body: Thanks for the comment about ripping it bit by bit. That might take time but
    it sounds like it will just plain work its tested as I'm going. I'll post again
    if I get any errors or stumbling blocks doing that.

    isn't valid OpenType syntax. You might want to brush up on the correct syntax
    for .fea files at http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    place.\"\r\n1. I made a Roman font, ca 1500 glyphs with a lot of OT features (all
    mine from a to z) \r\n2. I made a Bold font with the same glyph coverage but f_f
    ligature (by accident)\r\n3. I merged the .fea file from my Roman\r\n4. My new
    Bold has one empty slot named \"f_f\" so I am able to fill it and receive good,
    fully working font.\r\nI think that makes more sense than receiving error, after
    all my code is <strong>good.</strong>\r\n(I wish FF send a warning in that case)"

    do I properly name my lower case glyphs that \"@lowercase\" recognizes those unicode
    characters?\r\n\r\nfor instance, Arno Pro has:\r\n\r\nfeature c2sc { # Small Capitals

    c2sc18;\r\n\r\nwith a bit more of language script that I chopped out but still,
    how does this font recognize \"onum1\" by \"onum2\" \u2014 its not declared in
    any glyph name I see.\r\n(does that make sense?)"

      where \"onum1\" might be the default figures and onum2 wold be the oldstle figures.\r\n\r\nYour
      feature code would use the @ sign to indicate a class, as in: sub @onum1 by
      @onum2;\r\n\r\nThe names you input for classes as you design the font are most
      often swapped out by the software as it outputs your OTF file. To test this,
      \ design a font with odd class names and then output it as an otf.  Then open
      the otf inFontLab and look at the OT code.  You will see that your class names
      have been mapped to other ones."
