body: "At first, the idea of using small-caps for acronyms etc. is very appealing,
  but typographic success depends on an appropriate font: if the small-caps have the
  same x-height, then plurals and mixed case forms look quite poor (OpenMP, DoE, GeV,
  PDEs) etc. leading some to abandon the approach altogether (see this thread about
  [[http://typophile.com/node/84025|typesetting units]] for example.)\r\n\r\nWhat
  fonts provide suitable mid caps (quarter caps?) to support consistent and thorough
  use of small-caps for acronyms etc.?\r\n\r\nI know Actium, but at the time of writing,
  however, this is the <em>only</em> font with the [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22mid+caps%22/fonts/|\"mid
  caps\" tag on MyFonts]].  Many other fonts are suitable: FF Atma provides both mid
  and quarter caps for example, and other fonts like Vesper Pro (as discussed in [[http://typophile.com/node/70315|this
  thread]]) have larger SC with the x-height caps as petite caps. What other fonts
  provide this or similar features?  (If you know of too many alternatives to list,
  I am mostly interested in text-faces for extended scientific, so fonts that would
  work well with math fonts such as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS_Euler|Zapf's
  AMS Euler]] font would be appreciated.) I know of the following:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typemafia/actium/|Actium]]:
  Actium is [[http://typophile.com/node/75996|discussed in this thread]] and supports
  a wonderful \"Smart Capo\" feature of contextual alternatives that automatically
  replaces acronyms etc. with appropriate midsize caps (try it out in the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typemafia/actium/|MyFonts
  sample]] - though this fails to capitalize acronyms at the start of the sentence.
  \ Probably just a sample limitation.)  Are there any other fonts with contextual
  alternatives?</li>\r\n<li>[[https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/atma-serif|FF Atma Serif]]:
  Provides mid caps and quarter caps.  (Not exactly sure if this is implemented as
  separate weights or with the OTF Petite-Caps feature.)</li>\r\n<li>[[http://www.motaitalic.com/typefoundry/fonts/vesper/opentype-features/|Vesper
  Pro]]: Provides larger SC and x-height petite caps.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWhat other
  fonts would work well for a complete treatment of acronyms, units, etc. with small
  or mid caps?\r\n\r\nMichael.\r\n\r\np.s. As I am new to this site, I did not yet
  start a wiki page to collect this list, but will if the thread manages to collect
  a good selection of fonts.  What would be the best index to include this under?
  \ Perhaps a FAQ?"

  body: "<em>Actium \u2026 supports a wonderful \"Smart Capo\" feature \u2026</em>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    an interesting idea, but it should have been implemented as a Stylistic Set, which
    is discretionary, not Contextual Alternates, which is on by default in CS apps
    etc.\r\n\r\nWithout any features applied, it causes strange things to happen,
    such as a mixture of lining and old style figures, e.g. at the Museum of Modern
    Art:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MoMA_5104.jpg]\r\n\r\nRather than
    save time, I suspect Smart Capo would require extra vigilance in typography and
    proofreading.\r\n\r\nIMO, the default figure style should remain so if no features
    are applied by the typographer, and the Small Capitals feature (smcp) should always
    show the default figure style, with lining, small-cap-height figures belonging
    in the All Small Capitals feature (smcp + c2sc)."

  body: "Depending on the features of the layout program -- we use InDesign -- you
    can scale the small caps in a character style, and scale them non-proportionally.
    Now I'm sure the purists will howl, but as long as you don't go too far, it works.
    I've gone up to about 107% vertically and 104% (IIRC) horizontally in Minion,
    before the weight gets too great. \r\n\r\nThe apparent weight is the biggest limiting
    factor, as the glyphs pick up weight as you scale them up. That and not going
    too far in one direction, so as to distort them too much. Finally, with InDesign,
    you lose kerning between a scaled glyph any other glyph not so scaled -- like
    the apostrophe, lower case s, etc. Kerning within the scaled glyphs is not affected.\r\n\r\nIt
    is best to have two sets of \"small caps\" in the font. Lacking that, and lacking
    permission to modify the font by adding them, such scaling in the layout program
    is about all that's available. As usual, it is more work than modifying the font
    by adding to it, unless you only use the font occasionally. If you're using Adobe
    fonts, or another font with permission to modify, and you know your way around
    a font editing program, that's the best way.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: Michael, the problem you point was one of the main reasons I decided to develop
    my own font. The project uses larger small caps and petite caps which match x-height,
    as can be viewed [[http://www.if.pro.br/PC01.png|here]] and in a [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|thread]]
    from the Critique section.

  body: "Thanks everyone for your comments and suggestions. \r\n\r\n@Charles: Ultimately
    I will probably be doing most of the layout with LaTeX or XeLaTeX which would,
    in principle, allows for quite a bit of programmatic flexibility, including the
    ability to fake caps by scaling.  However, I would rather use a font with two
    sets of caps designed in as you suggest.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it raises an
    interesting question: Given a well proportioned x-height small-cap and full cap,
    how well would interpolating between these to produce a mid-cap work?  I would
    imagine that such an interpolation would be quite reasonable as it should preserve
    the weight of the characters much better than simply scaling in two directions
    could.  (I will have to explore with some of the fonts supplying both small and
    mid-caps to see how well the mid-caps represent such an interpolation.)\r\n\r\n@Nick:
    I was wondering how well the Smart Capo feature would work in practice: I agree
    that it might become a proof-reading nightmare.  As I plan to work in (Xe)LaTeX,
    I will probably do all the markup manually through semantic markup (acronyms etc.)
    so the automagic behaviour is not really needed (but I liked the idea).\r\n\r\n@Andreas:
    Andron might work nicely.  This is not something I need immediately though, so
    I can probably wait until Andron-Versalmediuskeln is released.\r\n\r\n@hrant:
    Not sure if Ernestine will work for me, but it looks very nice.\r\n\r\nMichael."

  body: "Just as a point of clarification, what I'm talking about is scaling the existing
    small caps up a bit, not \"faking\" them from full caps. Of course, TeX will let
    you do this as well.\r\n\r\nBTW, there have been several threads in Typophile
    on how to make \"true-cut\" small caps from the full caps. Its been a number of
    years since I used TeX -- and we used plain TeX with our own macros -- but the
    main reason to go to a font editing program is to be able to control the weight.
    Couldn't do that with the old TeX, or any layout program I know of. Just a matter
    of time, I imagine. \r\n\r\nIn a font editing program, scale down the full caps,
    non-proportionally. When starting with full caps, my starting point is to scale
    down 4 percent less horizontally than vertically. Of course, you have to look
    at the result & adjust as necessary. Then increase the weight. The other reason
    to use a font editing program is to handle the little touches that let you create
    really \"true-cut\" small and/or petite and/or mid caps. Serifs, and the round
    letters...\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nThe other thing to watch for is the x-height not
    be generally too large. If it is large, there isn't much room for distinct petite
    caps. I was thinking of Charis, which we've modified successfully for our work,
    but the x-height is quite large. Petite caps could be done, but would be a bit
    tricky.\r\n\r\nOpen Source fonts like Charis are of course modifiable, and those
    modifications can be distributed. At 11:00pm at home, I can't remember just which
    Gyre fonts are actually good ... Sadly, I find most rather lacking. IIRC, Pagella
    isn't too bad, if you can stand a Palatino."
