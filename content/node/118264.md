  Style Magazine? I need especially the \"Style\" word from this image, in a bigger
  size, but the exactly similar font would be the best.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5474.jpg]"

  body: "This blackletter with a Textura flavor is called \"Fraktur Six\" and was
    created by Matthew Carter in 2005, loosely based on The New York Times's nameplate.
    It is not available for licensing.\r\nThe retail font with the closest _S_ is
    perhaps Fette Gotisch which was designed by Friedrich Bauer in 1875 and is available
    in digital form from various foundries, including http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fette-gotisch/\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "The letter _y_ is close to Agincourt http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/agincourt/\r\nIf
    Agincourt's _t_, _l_ and _e_ are not close enough you can find closer ones by
    digging through various fraktur fonts. A place to start http://typophile.com/node/117850\r\nIn
    any event, you will have to adjust the weights of all of the letters in _Style_
    and make adjustments to get an exact match.\r\nDon"
