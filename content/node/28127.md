body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nHere are three pages from my thesis showing my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28085\">modified
  version</a> of ITC Mendoza in action, esp. the small caps that Randy discussed with
  me earlier. I should've posted something like this right away.\r\n\r\nI agree that
  the small caps look too heavy and too small, esp. when used as on p. 155.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  But I still think that beefing up the serifs, esp. the top serifs (and also the
  horizontal stem of e.g. T) was an improvement. The original ones look too anemic
  to me. The small caps of slab-serif faces seem to be a little problematic, though.\r\n\r\nBTW,
  do you think the italics (EDIT: i.e. the ordinary lowercase italics) are too heavy?
  Their weight I haven't changed, compared to the ITC original.\r\n\r\nFeel free to
  comment on anything on these pages, including the setting!\r\n\r\nNote that since
  setting the thesis, I have changed the fi and fl ligatures (making them wider, among
  other things) and reduced the sidebearings (esp. the right one) of the numeral 4.
  The specimen that I posted earlier (see the link above) shows the corrected versions,
  but I was too lazy to reset the pages I'm posting now.\r\n\r\nOlli"

    PDFs are a bit awkward to download and view, of course, but I knew of no other
    way to show a mass of text in a high enough resolution.\r\n\r\nOlli"

  body: "I hardly have the experience to speak for everyone, though the passages of
    body text are useful for some types of examination, it is also helpful to have
    simple character set specimens to compare the letters with others in its own font,
    and with the unaltered ITC Mendoza.\r\n\r\nInserting a small sample as a visible
    image would help a bit to attract attention (speaking from the marketing side
    of my ass)."

  body: "The first link in my original post (or <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28085\">this
    one</a>) will take you to an earlier thread where I posted a PDF listing the original
    and the modified glyphs; you should ideally look at it before these whole-page
    specimens (sorry I didn't make this clear enough at the outset).\r\n\r\nI should've
    done this whole thing in a more user-friendly way, I admit. (I may return to that
    later.)\r\n\r\nBut if anyone is interested at looking the whole-page specimens
    here, it is primarily the punctuation and other unalphabetics as well as the smalls
    caps that I have changed, relative to the ITC original."
