body: "Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to fashion a monoline font that does
  NOT scale in thickness when you change its size. Eg the line thickness of a 24 pt
  glyph would be the same in 35 or 67 or 128 (etc.). Or, to state it differently:
  I would like to set the stroke for a whole block of text, independent from the glyph
  sizes\u2026\r\nAnd then some more: I would like to be able to set the stroke in
  my design applications.\r\nAnd to make it even more complicated: how about being
  able to change the line ends (rounded, square, etc.) as one can in Illustrator,
  FreeHand, cum suis?\r\n\r\nMy reasoning: when mixing type sizes in headlines and
  subs (using a monoline) the effect (and the 'colour') would be a lot better if the
  stroke thicknesses did not scale."

    ways. One would need to know if the font was going to appear as a mathematical
    monoline or an apparent monoline, an optically scaling mathematical or apparent
    monoline, and the precise sizes and resolutions required. With this, the best
    way could be specified.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: But it's not automatic, requiring the use of a table, which he provides, giving
    the stroke thickness at various point sizes, for the different fonts.
