body: "Hi guys,\r\nSomeone could help me recognize this font? I tried in different
  ways but it\u2019s to hard for me.\r\nIt has a sort of Jenson\u2019s spirit, but
  less precise, more close to Tribute (by emigre), Maxime, ecc...\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schermata
