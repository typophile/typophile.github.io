body: What are all of your thoughts on communicating the ideals of "technology" typographically
  without going to the so often used square sans serif typefaces with sharp "techy"
  feel that is so overused. any suggestions?

  body: I think a lot of people used to use DIN and Eurostile for this. To the point
    of complete overkill. Which is why you're wanting to avoid the squared sans serifs.
    Myself I would let the type do what the type does (for the reasons above) and
    attempt to convey 'technology' otherwise; imagery, colour, pattern, tone, layout,
    stock or print process perhaps.

  body: "I would go for 'humanized technology' instead, with light weight contemporary
    slabs. They tend to look sharp on paper, but still warm enough. I guess you could
    try the regular weight, too, and see which one you like the best.\r\n\r\nTry Caecilia,
    Chapparal or Nexus (I don't know if the latter has a light weight, though.)"
