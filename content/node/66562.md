body: "I'm using FF Legato (the lighter weights) for the identity of a jewelry designer
  \u2013 meaning the wordmark is set in Legato, as well as additional bits on the
  stationery and business card. Now I need to come up with a font (family) to recommend
  for her correspondence. Assuming that it would be possible to get a style-linked
  version of Legato (?), I'd recommend it to her for the text as well; and she loves
  it, but for the text she'd like to see some alternatives too, \xABmaybe something
  with serifs\xBB.\r\n\r\nThis would probably have to feel accessible, but not dumb;
  beautiful, but not <em>too</em> \xABpolished\xBB (see below); rather feminine, but
  not too wispy and swirly (think correspondence \u2013 no book faces); it could go
  in a slab direction as well, but it can't get brutish. Most importantly, in terms
  of proportions and \xABtone\xBB, it needs to click with Legato, and not overpower
  it. It should \xABfeel\xBB like high value.\r\n\r\nFWIW her jewelry is beautifully
  hand-made and not cheap, while individualized and rather nonstandard (although in
  a subdued/smart rather than a flamboyant way); for example often using locally found
  rocks in place of jewels, or special kinds of surface treatment. So the font might
  be subtly \xABspecial\xBB/nonstandard too (like Legato is too). \r\n\r\nOn the technical
  side, the font should be available as a style-linked family of 4 for office type
  use.\r\n\r\nIf any fonts pop into your collective minds, I'm all ears. :-)"

  body: With the forms of Legato, have you tried Mrs Eaves? x-height is totally different,
    but there could be something with the basic shapes.

    potentially too \xABbookish\xBB, and Avance seems too weird for most clients (and
    yes, potentially too dark); but I'll give them both a spin. "

  body: With taller x-height it evens out the serifs from basic Mrs Eaves. But, with
    serifs, and the overall feel, you should at least try it with Legato.

  body: I think Mrs. Eaves XL is too large for text. Dangerously close to ITC Garamond.
    I wish there was a Mrs. Eaves M.

  body: I'm looking at the emphasized antiqua feel in sans serif Legato, and strict
    vertical stress of serif in Mrs Eames. Look at them together.

  body: "Ooh, Hrant, Prensa is niice.\r\nDoesn't look very available though? :-/\r\n\r\nTomi,
    I will look. I think it's potentially too pretty for this though. A \"rougher\"
    design seems more fitting in a way. And that x-height really is a bit much. :-/\r\n\r\nAny
    thoughts on FF Yoga? I'm not really a huge fan of it so far, but something tells
    me it might work for this. "
