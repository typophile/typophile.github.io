  website of an educational publishing company. The tagline is \"teaching | learning
  | growing | TOGETHER.\" The desire for an organic community led to this connected
  and bracketed Minion Pro (our corporate font).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/together_6713.jpg]\r\n\r\nDoes
  it work at all? Does one weight work better than another? Have I made any egregious
  errors? I welcome all thoughts, broad and nitpicky.\r\n\r\nPS - It will be seen

    Either the ear of the \"g\" as you have it, or on the \"r\" I'd make it the beak
    itself. And join the \"th\" only at the bottom or the top, not both.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      it much more.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo03_3930.gif]\r\n\r\nI
      had a concern about merely reducing the logotype and placing it on the web navigation,
      which is fairly minute. Let me show you what I mean...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo01_5289.gif]\r\n\r\nSee
      there? The rest of the identities are quite tame. Placing something that different
      in the middle makes me want to start singing songs from Sesame Street.\r\n\r\nWhat
      do y'all think of keeping the above edit as the main logotype, but putting a
      toned-down version on the navigation, as seen below?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo02_6481.gif]"

  body: but connections actually directly apply the "togetherness". It's true I would
    change the connection between "g" and "e" because it's straight and somehow unnatural,
    but I'd definitely keep them.

    I see your point, and I'll tweak that as soon as I get into work. Thanks!"

    bar with the uncapitalized title, and requested that I make a capitalized version.
    Here it is. I'd love comments on the new connection, as well as my slightly smoothed
    E and Litera's g-connection.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo04_5983.gif]"

  body: "I like the lower case better because only the \"g\" gets emphasized with
    the leaf. With the capital T you get differently weighted logo. If your boss insists
    on the capital letter I'd lower the cap height. Looks like it can go lower. Half
    the space between T's serif and \"o\".\r\n\r\nI like the connection between \"g\"
    and \"e\" much better. A bit more curvature would probably do the trick even better.
    The bottom part of it still makes it look a bit too straight. But if your tests
    turn out this one is the best I'm satsified with this one too.\r\n\r\nDid you
    also change the connection between the \"e\" and \"t\"? Because it does look smaller
    and it comes at a bigger angle on the \"t\". I think something in between would
    be best. The first one has much darker \"t\", the second one too light."

    note altered T (thanks, litera), tweaked g (thanks, litera), and nudged e (thanks,

    will come after me with a cudgel for these alterations? I want to make it feel

  body: "How likely? I'd say 1 in a million... But there's still a chance. :D\r\n\r\nAbout
    the capital letter T. It's lower for sure but I guess you've scaled the complete
    letter not just lower the top bar and making it a bit narrower. Also with smaller
    size I should be SLIGHTLY more away from \"o\". But with lowering instead of scaling
    \ the larger bottom serif would probably do the trick.\r\n\r\nBut. Consider another
    alternative. Keep the big (normal) letter \"T\" and make the leaf stand out a
    bit. Some with size, some with angle... To reach higher up. To emphasize it.\r\n\r\nBut
    if others would think that the lower \"T\" works fine I'm satisfied with it. It
    doesn't look bad to me at all. It actually looks better as I thought it would
    to my eyes.\r\n\r\nBUT. Remember it's going to be you in the end who will decide
    what is ok and what's not. Don't design as we say. We only gove alternatives and
    look for flaws that you may not see since you design it."

  body: "Actually, I did drop the top bar, but then I shrunk the serifs, because I
    felt that they were too angular, and that bringing them in would soften the effect
    of the T on the overall design. I like the idea of tweaking the leaf a bit ...
    I think it could stand to be a bit more eye-catching. But I like the natural eye-swoop
    from the T to the \"th,\" and the leaf isn't at present competing with that. I
    wonder if there's a way to maintain that shape without affecting the eye movement
    too much.\r\n\r\n(And don't worry, I actually don't feel compelled to implement
    every suggestion given. I just like your suggestions. Every lil' bit helps, says
    I.)"

    do is tweak the leaf a bit and see if it can be improved. And keep the rest. I
    think the leaf can be changed in a way to not interfere with other nice details.
    I'd just like to emphasize it a bit because it's beautiful and memorable.\r\n\r\nI
    thought at the very beginning this was a very nice logo anyway. It just needed
    some detail finish."

    only thing there is for David: This club's logo is one more argument why NOT use
    the UC \"T\" in your logo."

  body: "I find some of these ligatures too contrived and the leaf too obvious a response
    to organic. A simpler answer could be to use a single ligature, for example, you
    could create a th ligature using the loop style of an st ct ligature I feel this
    could work for your navigation bar too, possibly altered to increase the weight.
    In an uppercase version the ligature could be the OG although that may set THE
    BOOKSHeLF apart as the only sans and heaviest.\r\n\r\nTim"
