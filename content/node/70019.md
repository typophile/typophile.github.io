body: "Miguel Sousa just discovered some bugs in the MakeOTF.py script file that supports
  using the \"makeotf\" command to build an OpenType/TTF font from a source TTF font.
  The next FDK release won't be for a couple months, but if anyone needs this functionality
  now, just e-mail me and I will send you the new MakeOTF.py script file.\r\n\r\n-
