<p>I currently live a pretty sedentary lifestyle, work several hours a day in front of a computer sitting on my posterior and getting little to no exercise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how many of you have shared my fate and were able to make modifications to successfully achieve a healthier more active lifestyle?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to be inspired and possibly learn about some new activities. I&rsquo;m not necessarily excited about going back to the gym. Please enlighten me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I hit the gym regularly, for long periods of time. For a while I was down to four days a week, but now I’ve pushed back up to six days a week  of intense bodybuilding workouts followed by time on the elliptical trainer, for a total of around 12-14 hours a week. If I don’t work out like this I get (more) misanthropic and my entire body starts to cramp, twitch, and be generally unfriendly toward my lifestyle of curling up in front of books and computers.</p>
<p>On top of the gym time I also walk to and from work (and just about everywhere else that I go) and walk my dogs several times a day.</p>

I get most of my work done in the early AM, but still take a break in between there to go on a steady sprint single track bike ride.</p>
<p>Having a dog helps alot, because she lets me know that I better take her out two to three times a day. Start swimming, find a hobby, take up trail running, surfing, road or MTB biking, rock climbing, sky diving, anything. I just had to find another passion and stick with it.</p>
<p>You can be real meaty like myself and crank out pushups and turn it into a game, who doesnt like pushups anyways. Working out is just as mental as design. Its EASY for us (to some extent) to sit behind a computer and work, and dread getting excercise, but if you do it enough, you long for the excercise, and more over NEED it. Stop thinking about it and go do it. GO. DO. BE. once you get into the routine its like figuring out your design process, it just works.</p>

<p>James, were you always an outdoorsy type of person or did you decide one day to make a change to try and be more adventurous? I agree with the idea of finding something active that I can be passionate about and then incorporate it into my routine. I&rsquo;m not making the necessary changes to accommodate this idea yet and I really should just do it.</p>

Next to that I draw alot, watch movies and go to school. My only exercise at the moment consists of riding my bike to school, which is only about 30 mins in all daily, and walking to the city and back.
Oh well, it has been (even) worse and it has been better. I have about 3 months of holidays coming up in about 3 weeks, so then I will take long walks and such. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your six pack has a six pack doesn’t it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Hopefully I’ll get there one day. I ended up working out to train for a week of biking in Provence and found that the exercise nipped most of my health problems in the bud, and that adding in more resistance training gave me a sunnier outlook on&hellip;everything. The harder I work at the gym, the better I feel everywhere else, so now I’m starting to really push my workouts.</p>
<p>Also, learning a lot about exercise has also taught me a lot about eating better. I have a pretty fast metabolism, so I have to make sure that I eat right to fuel every little bit of exercise. Cutting all that crap out of my diet compounds all the benefits of exercise. When I get really strict about it I feel almost as good as I do after a week in France, where even the junk food is healthy compared to the crap on the shelves here in the USA.</p>

And when I&rsquo;m not out with my canoe, I head straight into &lsquo;the bush&rsquo; and hike around - sometimes for days on end. I always take along a sketch book and me old pentax k1000 - design ideas are everywhere.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really appreciate all the responses. I&rsquo;m actually surprised about how active everyone is, and I&rsquo;m jealous (in a good way) of you all. I&rsquo;m trying to get myself psyched up to get back in shape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing my homework, reading up about exercise and diets.
I&rsquo;ve tried to alter my diet to include more protein and reduce unnecessary sugars and processed carbohydrates. However, I&rsquo;m still lax about how much I eat and I definitely don&rsquo;t get enough fruits and veggies. I also have a penchant for whole grains.</p>
<p>Apparently, 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week would be plenty if I focus on building muscle mass (which would in turn burn calories faster.) and then getting plenty of rest (which is currently not a problem.)</p>
<p>In the past, I would spend most of my time at the gym on an Elliptical machine, and after a few months, I&rsquo;d dreaded going. I ended up stopping mid-Fall, mixed with my lack of enthusiasm and the crumby weather, I never returned. Now I&rsquo;m easily 15lbs heavier and tired all the time. I&rsquo;ve realized how much not exercising has affected me and I wish I would have been more diligent. It&rsquo;s going to be a tough transition back into an active lifestyle, but I&rsquo;ve done it before. I know after about 2 weeks, I&rsquo;ll be re-energized and hopefully more motivated to continue. It would be nice to have someone to keep me in line though.</p>

I plan not to chug away, or atleast not at the frequency of which I used to.</p>
<p>Good idea, but I don&rsquo;t think I could listen to a podcast while I work out. I need loud music, preferably with a fast beat. In the past, I would listen to DFA1979, a great mix of rock and electronic. I&rsquo;ll have to find some new stuff to fill the iPod with, maybe some classics, like the Stones, or something new like Justice. As long as it&rsquo;s upbeat.</p>

<p>And we walk most places and use our bikes &ndash; not owning a car (by choice) means we also haul groceries and recycling by hand.  Like Mili said, lots of stairs as well (not hard when you live on the top floor of a walk-up building!).</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes we&rsquo;ve done in the last five years is eating better: fresh local meat and produce, as few processed foods as possible (but I won&rsquo;t give up dark chocolate), and a vegetarian &ldquo;day&rdquo; at least once a month. We rarely do take-out and never McD&rsquo;s: we could probably do more grains and less booze, but there&rsquo;s no reason to get that keen.  ;-)</p>

Either walk or bike to the grocery store (2km each way) then carry it all back, usually in a backpack. Also have 2 sled dogs, so that ads about another 45min-1hr or walk/run/jog at night and 1km in the morning if I have to do it, otherwise my wife takes them out.</p>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s nice our I&rsquo;ll bike a few places, but never really for &lsquo;fun&rsquo; only as a means of transportation. Also soccer is starting up and I play midfield, so it increases how much I run by a lot. Speaking of which, I am walking like a peg-leg today because my calves are so sore from Sunday&rsquo;s pick-up game.</p>
<p>In the winter we&rsquo;ll snowshoe,  ski and skijor with the dog, dogs now, but we just got the second one. We also hike all year round, and hopefully this summer we&rsquo;ll get into doing some rock climbing. We love canoeing but don&rsquo;t own a canoe or car.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really do much with the intent of getting in shape or anything, especially with 2 wrecked knees, these are just activities I enjoy. I&rsquo;ve never been to a gym and would be lost in one, I think.</p>

<p>@ Linda: I&rsquo;ve recently started taking glucosamine tablets and it&rsquo;s made a huge difference on my knees. The pain isn&rsquo;t as sharp and I can get more done, I find, w/o them bothering me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the outdoors, but until recently havnt had the $$ to pay for the hobbies. IE a season pass at Squaw Valley is just over $1,000, imagine skiing in the middle of  abig project, just hit a couple of runs and come back in. Mountain biking is a passion, and its even more expensive for the bike and regular maintenence, but like getting a new office setup, once you splurge, then your set to have some fun.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I bike. And since I love speed, I go out and boot it for an hour or so. There is nothing, for me at least, like the high I get from going as fast as I can on my bike. Best is in the morning when there are fewer people on the bike paths and it&rsquo;s usually cooler, too. I wish I could bike to work every day, but I drive my kids to and from school and daycare 3 or 4 days a week, so on the off days, I try to bike, or I walk to the metro station. Sometimes, if I&rsquo;m wearing appropriate shoes, I&rsquo;ll walk home at a brisk trot.</p>
<p>In the summer I also try to go to the outdoor pool and do an hour of laps 2 or 3 times a week. Doesn&rsquo;t always work out because of the schedule with the kids, tho. I&rsquo;ve been trying to improve my breathing &ndash; doing consecutive laps without panicking is a challenge I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>On my lunch hour twice a week, I go to a yoga class given by the university&rsquo;s athletics and recreation dept. They offer a ton of classes and I&rsquo;ve been thinking that next winter I will try the spinning class, tho I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t live up to cycling. Also the university&rsquo;s gym and classes are WAY cheaper than regular gyms.</p>
<p>And, once a week I have a 2 hour tango class with my guy and we also go dancing (tango) on Friday night every second weekend. Problem is, the alcohol consumed on those nights cancels out any of the calorie-burning potential, I&rsquo;m sure. But as a side note, learning tango can be a great way to meet people &ndash; and I mean friends, too.</p>
<p>Mmm and every once in a while my boyfriend drags me down to the dungeon to lift weights. I find it brutal, but it feels great afterwards. I don&rsquo;t quite have the discipline or motivation for the 4 days a week at 6am routine, though.</p>
<p>I live in central Montreal in one of the neighbourhoods that will be trendy ten or fifteen years from now, but for the moment is still exhibiting signs of welfare, social housing, and general poverty. Ain&rsquo;t no green forests around here.</p>

Things would be different if I lived almost anywhere else in this country, especially in a remote village. Mind you, I suppose this place almost fits the definition of a remote village, since in the whole of capital area there are 1 million people and in Helsinki only 0,5 mil. with plenty of forest and water around.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I continuously PLAN to get exercise, but never do… My girlfriend tells me every day she&rsquo;s worried about me &lsquo;not moving at all&rsquo;. And she&rsquo;s right. I used to play squash (until I tore a calfmuscle) and before that swam (until someone jumped on me and I almost lost an eye).</p>
<p>We just bought another place in Amsterdam (about 140 kms from where my main residence is) and plan on staying there a week or so per month. There&rsquo;s a public bath nearby, so I might take up swimming again. And walk a lot along the canals, ofcourse.</p>
<p>Foodwise we are doing great — no junk, lots of fresh vegs, little meat. But I do like a glass of white wine, so…</p>
<p>Last year, when I was separated from my wife, I lost a lot of weight because of the stress of that situation and workrelated problems (and gained all of that back after I stopped working and hooked up with the love of my life). Nowadays most of the stress from my existence has been eradicated, so it looks like I will have to take that advice and get moving. ; ).</p>

<p>Death works great for me as a diet. Everytime I lose anyone close, the pounds come off because I can&rsquo;t eat or sleep for days.</p>
<p>When I first got Bogie (pup on right side)&ndash; I walked him 6 times a day - and within two months I was down two dress sizes.</p>
<p>Ollie comes tomorrow - I am so looking forward to all our puppy walks together.</p>
<p>My advice - get a pet to walk (or borrow one) keep up the routine and it will do you a world of good.</p>
<p>Oh and to be ethically/politically/legally or whatever correct - please consult your doctor before starting any rigorous exercise program. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, now I don&rsquo;t feel so bad. There&rsquo;s a few Typies that are in the same boat with me and we all have short oars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a pet, and my current living arrangements prevent me from having any. I do take walks with a friend who has 2 small pugs. They&rsquo;re a handful, but I enjoy the challenge of keeping them in line while we try and trek a decent distance. Maybe in the near future I&rsquo;ll consider getting a puppy of my own.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually live in Harrisburg, but one of it&rsquo;s smaller neighboring suburbs. There&rsquo;s not much here except a bunch of houses. I walk as much as I can, but it does get repetitive. I&rsquo;ve exhausted most of my common routes and there aren&rsquo;t too many new ones. There&rsquo;s a few parks in the area, but the closest is about a 20 minute car ride. I try and get out as often as I can, I actually like to play Disc Golf (Frisbee Golf to the layman) when I can.</p>
<p>Linda you were close, I live near the Applachians not the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll try and give you a broad answer. Disc Golf is definitely  fun, and if you understand the concept of golf, it&rsquo;s also pretty easy.</p>
<p>You do not need a lot of discs. Your needs might differ, some people play with 1 or 2 discs, others with 30. It all depends on how much you get into the sport.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of discs. Distance Drivers (Very Long Drives, but not always accurate. Most driver discs look very aerodynamic with a sharp edge), Fairway Drivers (Shorter Drives, but much more reliable accuracy wise), Approach Discs (These are the brute discs, good for mid to short ranges or out of dense forest/wooden areas. The edge of the disc isn&rsquo;t as sharp) and finally Putting discs (Similar to the Approach Discs but made to fly very accurate only at short ranges, they look the most like a common Wamm-O Frisbee with a very blunt edge.)</p>
<p>My advice, spend $10-20 bucks (they&rsquo;re cheap) and pick up at least 2 discs. A Driver (Fairway preferably) that weights about 10-11 grams (this is a safe starters weight) and an Approach/Putter that weights about 10-13 grams with a soft/pliable feel, almost like rubber if you can find one.) The weight is marked on the underside of the discs usually.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a PDF chart for selecting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Innova Driver discs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Approach/Putter discs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a few different ways to throw the discs (Cross Step, Side Arm, Hammer and Roller) but it&rsquo;s hard to discribe them in words.</p>
<p>(here&rsquo;s a PDF of illustrations on how to throw : <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Innova Throwing Chart<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a list of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Youtube videos on Throwing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I hope this gives you an idea of what&rsquo;s involved with Disc Golf. If you&rsquo;d like to find other courses/events in your area check this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Course Directory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I tried disc golf once, and had a blast. We played in a nature reserve forest on an island somewhere near Vancouver on this privately owned property that a pal was overseeing as a forest ranger. He had developed the course himself, and it wove between the huge tree. I&rsquo;m not sure any other kind of course would quite live up to that first experience. Also I can&rsquo;t throw for sh*t.</p>
<p>I love yoga. There are different kinds, so find out before you try it &ndash; or not. Jump in and see if you like it. Any good teacher will respect your level of flexibility. There will be others able to go way further into the posture, but you go at your own pace and to the point where you can without hurting yourself. The other thing with yoga that many people don&rsquo;t realize is that it also builds strength. You can certainly build up a sweat in even a very mild class.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To add to Kristina&rsquo;s comment, yoga not only builds flexibility and strength but also balance, both physical and mental. I agree you need to ease your way into it, tho, try different kinds and different teachers and don&rsquo;t push yourself too hard. You can hurt yourself if you get all macho and do things your body really doesn&rsquo;t want to do. I absolutely love it, but my favorite teacher had a baby and I never got back into the swing of it, my bad.</p>
<p>Problem for me too is that when I have time off from working I want to paint, not exercise. But I&rsquo;m not getting younger&hellip;</p>

<p>And New Yorkers do walk much more than other americans. The average american walks a mile over the course of a day. New Yorkers walk an average of 4 miles a day.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I feel your pain. I absolutely hate working out and exercising. But I do enjoy the results. I train five days a week, but I try to keep it fun, because I get bored easily.</p>
<p>I started out going to the gym just 2 days a week and just about 30 min - 1 hour per day. Then I saw some results. A year later, I&rsquo;m at the gym five times a week and feeling pretty nice. I go first thing in the morning to get it done and over with so I don&rsquo;t dread all day thinking about it. Come 5 o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;m sitting pretty listening to other people dread their gym appt.</p>
<p>Start out again slowly, then increase things such as your days there, the types of food you&rsquo;re eating, your work outs. If you go all gung ho at once,  might just end up in the same place. That&rsquo;s happened to me.</p>
<p>It also helps for me to bring my iPod. I have to have my music or something to just keep me in my zone. I download pod casts and news and things like that to keep me entertained too. Next thing I know, it&rsquo;s time to go, and oh look at that bicep!</p>
<p>Good luck, feel free to check back in. Would be great to see your progress. :)</p>

Anyway, going boing boing on a dancefloor sounds brilliant, I envy you Steven, I&rsquo;m too self conscious on dance floors, I never know what I&rsquo;m supposed to do with my arms and stuff.</div>
