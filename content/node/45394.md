body: "I would like to submit a screenshot from my computer (PowerPC G4 - MacOs 10.4.11)
  because my FontLab decided to stop working this morning, and I tried everything
  I could think of, from erasing the preferences to uninstalling-reinstalling the
  program, but I still can't manage to open FontLab.\r\n\r\nIt's strange because I've
  had it working for more than a year, on this same computer, with no problem at all.
  \r\n\r\nIt worked untill last night, but when I opened it this morning, this is
  what i got: no file opening, no bar on top, just the chance to quit the program,
  and when I do that it crashes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab-problem_5608.jpg]"

  body: "Did you install anything between last night and this morning? Think hard!
    It's unusual for apps to suddenly just fail, but saying that MS Office recently
    bottomed out on my MacPro for no aparent reason. I'm not so surprised about that
    though and I can happily live without Office. Good riddance and welcome OpenOffice.
    If you did install anything (however small) remove it completely and try again.\r\n\r\nIf
    not, set up a new (admin) user on the machine and try to run FontLab logged in
    as the new user. If it works, then it's your account that's to blame. You might
    like to migrate your account if FontLab's of utmost importance. Or painstakingly
    weedle-out the problem process ...\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work try killing non-essential
    processes and re-running it. You can see all processes in Terminal with ps -cax.
    Typing kill [process id] will terminate a process. You can't do any real damage,
    but make sure you don't have any important suff open when you do this.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, if you've tried completely uninstalling/reinstalling FontLab, put it
    down as a mystery and leap for the OSX DVD. Bit drastic that though.\r\n\r\nLet
    us know how you go."

  body: "Ok, thanks to both of you guys, I ended up <strong>creating a new <cite>\"Fontlab\"</cite>
    account</strong> like Mark suggested, and it works! And since I'm too busy to
    reset everything as it was in my previous account...I will just live with the
    double-id system, enjoying the rotating cube as I switch from one to the other...
    at least untill I am done with this thesis! :)\r\n\r\nI still have not figured
    out why this occurred, I remember clearly not installing anything in the past
    days...but I can finally get back to work, so thanks a lot again!\r\na.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab-solution_5849.jpg]"
