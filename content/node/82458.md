  new and improved version of Gerard Unger\u2019s masterpiece now features three new
  styles that have been engineered specifically for headline use. Coranto 2 makes
  the most of current newspaper printing technologies delivering clean, economic and
  highly legible text blocks combined with striking headlines. Coranto 2 introduces
  the addition of over 250 glyphs for a wider language support, redesign of most accents,
  new ligatures, 4 sets of numerals, arbitrary fractions, superiors/inferiors and
  more.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Coranto%202|More information on our
