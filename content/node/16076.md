  1981)\r\n\r\nJim is a type designer with Ascender Corp. and a graduate of Columbia
  College in Chciago, He has also started his own foundry, VersaType, to market his
  own type designs.\r\n\r\n\"I like to think of typefaces as voices for the content
  they are presenting. In some cases, they are merely gladiators, trained to fight
  the forces of less-than-perfect conditions. Type is [not only the most effective,
  but also] the primary vehicle for visual communication. Thanks Gutenberg!\" - Jim
  Ford\r\n\r\nFont families currently in production for VersaType include: Kingston,
  Magneticus, Coggeshall, Ford Sans and Ford Serif\r\n\r\nRelated Links\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/foundry/versatype/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ascendercorp.com/"
