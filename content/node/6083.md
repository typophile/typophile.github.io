  - <a href="http://www.xtypa.com/004/">Project History</a>  <BR>  <BR>Sonoma is my
  first serious attempt at completing a font. I was inspired by Evert Bloemsma&#39;s
  Avance to build a font with severely asymmetrical serifs. In the spirit of not wandering
  aimlessly, my goal is to make a font with which I can set papers for my college
  courses.  <BR>  <BR>At the moment, I&#39;ve completed the lower and upper case basic
  alphabet. I want to reorient myself now before I embark on the full character set.
  I have a few concerns:  <BR>  <BR>1 The character spacing seems wrong. Maybe it&#39;s
  too tight?  <BR>2 Some characters &#40;<b>e</b>, <b>s</b>, etc...&#41; seem too
  dark. Maybe this is caused by the spacing?  <BR>3 The character spacing for upper
  case only works when preceding lower case. Is it normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs
  to make all upper case text look alright?  <BR>4 Some of my glyph shapes &#40;<b>d</b>,
  <b>g</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>q</b>&#41; may be too crazy for a typeface intended for continuous
  text. Should I cave in an conventionalize them? &#40;I refuse to budge on <b>Q</b>;
  the tail stays&#41;  <BR>5 The bowls in <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>q</b>
  may be too large.  <BR>6 My upper case forms are rough because I have less practice
  drawing them. Any ideas for improvement?  <BR>  <BR>I may be overlooking far larger
  problems here. If so, please set me straight! Assistance will save me trouble down
  the road and will be tremendously appreciated.'

    think it&#39;s just right. Many modern faces are too loose. <BR> <BR><i>Some of
    my glyph shapes &#40;d, g, k, q&#41; may be too crazy for a typeface intended
    for continuous text. The bowls in b, d, p, and q may be too large.</i> <BR> <BR>Naw,
    they&#39;re not too crazy. I think the biggest problem is <BR>the bowl of the
    &#39;g&#39; is too small in comparison to the others <BR>which are lovely.

  body: 'Actually I think your spacing is in fact too tight overall. However: <BR>1.
    It seems that some areas &#40;like the &#34;ven&#34; sequence&#41; are fine, and
    in fact some are too loose - so it&#39;s still too uneven to tell. <BR>2. There&#39;s
    no easy way to be sure anyway without a physical printout in the intended medium  -
    probably through lino, right? <BR> <BR>The &#34;s&#34; is in fact too dark - because
    of its density it always has to be lighter than you think. <BR> <BR>&#62; Is it
    normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs to make all upper case text look alright? <BR>
    <BR>No, although I happen to think it&#39;s a great idea to use such an exhaustive
    matrix to loosen all-caps setting. <BR> <BR>Your &#34;bdpq&#34;... it depends
    who you ask: some designers will say they are &#34;wrong&#34;. But I think they&#39;re
    more than fine. In fact, I&#39;ve only seen such a wonderful &#34;d&#34; structure
    one other place - in my Patria... :-&#62;  But be careful of getting too attached
    to individual glyphs: taming overly flamboyant characters can be very painful
    but is usually necessary. <BR> <BR>Your main problem right now is the &#34;g&#34;
    &#40;by far the most difficult character in Latin&#41;. Don&#39;t let dogma ruin
    it for you. Some otherwise wonderful designs &#40;like Matrix&#41; really need
    a much smarter &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for your uppercase forms, what I might
    advise is something I hinted at in the thread about Avance: go orthodox. Those
    puppies are really gloriously stiff - it&#39;s all they got - let them shine in
    their own way. <BR> <BR>BTW, your comma is amazing! But do make its tail longer.

  body: Like the commas also. Maybe use the same structure in the quotes. <BR> <BR>In
    the text sample the g next to the o adds to its wormy look. IMO it could use more
    volume in the top and bottom and less in the middle. Maybe the tail could start
    a bit more left to give it more baseline stress and less like it&#39;s floating.
    <BR> <BR>Like what you&#39;ve got going. Also like the name Sanoma.

  body: Haven&#39;t had time to work on Sonoma recently, but the weeks ahead look
    promising. I did have time to find a couple designs that not only have half-serifs,
    but also have flares for balance. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/seagull/">Seagull</a>,
    by Adrian Williams and Bob McGrath, has a design based on handlettering, with
    asymetrical serifs, where with start of the serif stroke draws the balancing flare.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sierra/">Sierra</a>, by
    Kris Holmes, has flares which occupy a greater portion of their side of the stem
    than Avance or Sonoma, starting to flare about halfway down, and ending closer
    to vertical.

  body: 'I&#39;ve been trying to figure out what I like so much about this  <BR>face.
    I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s the clunkiness of the serifs combined  <BR>with the
    overall inconsistency. It&#39;s really alive. I&#39;ve long <BR>loved the clunkyness
    of slab serifs, but most are a little too  <BR>mechanical for my liking-- too
    perfect. This has more   <BR>vitality. <BR> <BR>I think it looks great in the
    setting. I would polish a few   <BR>characters, but nothing to change the overall
    feel. And   <BR>don&#39;t even think about taming the k. If you really want to   <BR>make
    a font to set a book in, start over. If you want a really   <BR>funky cool something
    for small blocks of copy, you&#39;re right  <BR>on. <BR> <BR>A few suggestions:
    The spur on the d and the q have got to <BR>go. They are awkward, and don&#39;t
    fit the other characters.   <BR>They imply a line that doesn&#39;t line up with
    anything else.   <BR>The d could take a cue from the a. I would work on the   <BR>terminals
    on the S, the j and the y. The terminals on the C   <BR>and the G are also a little
    awkward. The G feels a little   <BR>heavy. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t polish too much
    though. It would be a shame to loose <BR>the rough, chunky feel that makes this
    face so cool.'

  body: Here you go Eduardo. If it weren&#39;t for Opentype, I don&#39;t think I would
    have made a more conventional g, because I want my design to include a few unconventional
    choices of form. But now I&#39;ll just stick this more conventional g in the Opentype
    aalt feature so you can switch to it if you want. Now what I really wish is that
    there was a way to define my own features that would show up in the Opentype menu
    in InD etc so that you could apply the feature to a block of text at once. <BR>

    stylistic sets. with the advent of Adobe CS2, we now have support for this feature.
    just set up your feature to work how you want it and call it ss01 &#40;for stylistic
    set 1&#41;. For mor sets call them ss02, ss03, etc.

    on gut feel rather than actual knowledge, so I&#39;m probably out to lunch. If
    you&#39;re not going to use that, then I think you ought to make the 0 more ovoid.
    It really strongly resembles an oversized &#39;o&#39; right now. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    think the numerals are too wide. I guess I am kind of curious why the 1&#39;s
    serif structure is different from the letters&#39;, though. <BR> <BR>&#34;Bitey&#34;
    means the way the two serifs close in on the middle of the 3 makes it look like
    it&#39;s biting itself. It&#39;s too closed in, I would say.

  body: I agree that the figures are wide, and sometimes I think they look too big.
    <BR> <BR>One way of solving it is by making the shorter. And smaller, in consequence.
    This typeface is narrow, so I guess it is appropriate to have narrow figures.
    <BR> <BR>In general, I think that typefaces with low x-height are the ones that
    benefit more from having this kind of &#34;floating&#34; oldstyle figures &#40;figures
    taller/higher than the x-height&#41;. But this is a typeface with a generous x-height,
    so I think the figures should be closer to the x-height. &#40;But don&#39;t align
    them with the x-height! :-&#41;
