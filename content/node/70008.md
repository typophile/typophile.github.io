body: Anyone know the font used for "THE" "AND" and "DAP-KINGS". Also any clues to
  the type for "SHARON JONES" would be nice as well. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dap-Dippin'-by-Sharon-Jones-and-the-Dap-Kings_XPfMxNQGJxox_full_3989.jpg]

    035</a>, the Bitstream name for an older typeface whose name I forget at the moment.
    If you make the outline color the same as the shadow color I think you get the
    same look.\r\n\r\nThe sans may be Futura.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: One of the first typefaces I was ever aware of. I think I had some rub-down
    sheets of it when I was a kid. Cue "Man From U.N.C.L.E." theme...
