body: "Hi. I'm using Adobe FDK's feature file to add some GPOS tables into a font
  I'm working on. The script I'm working with requires pretty complex cursive positioning
  of glyphs...each stroke flows into the next, sometimes moving upward, downward,
  forward, or backward. And I'm wondering how to reset the vertical position back
  to the baseline for each word.\r\n\r\nIf I use the following as an example [I had
  to replace the angle brackets with parenthesis to show up in the forum]:\r\n\r\n<code>position
  cursive r (anchor 0 0) (anchor 300 300);</code>\r\n\r\nAnd type \"trrr tlll\" each
  r shifts in position properly...but then second word, tlll should start at the same
  vertical position as the first word does, but it doesn't...the vertical motion of
  trrr affects everything after it.\r\n\r\nI've tried using both anchors, tried using
  the first and setting the second to 0s, vice versa, I've even tried setting the
  space character to null anchors like this:\r\n\r\n<code>position cursive space (anchor
  NULL) (anchor NULL);</code>\r\n\r\nNothing works. Any idea how to solve this?! Is
  there a \"vertical reset\" positioning command?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n] chloe [\r\n\r\nBtw
  - this is my test feature file:\r\n\r\n<code># Script and language coverage\r\nlanguagesystem
  DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem latn dflt;\r\n\r\nfeature ccmp {\r\n\tposition cursive
  r (anchor 0 0) (anchor 200 200);\r\n\tposition cursive l (anchor 300 300) (anchor
  200 200);\r\n\tposition cursive s (anchor 200 200) (anchor 0 0);\r\n\tposition cursive
  space (anchor NULL) (anchor NULL);\r\n} ccmp;</code>"

    way to solve this would be if there's a font out there that uses cursive vertical
    positioning where each new word returns to the baseline, I could use that as a
    reference and see what they did. Does anyone know of any?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n]

  body: Check my [[http://amiri.sourceforge.net|Amiri font]], I use cursive positioning
    all the time and I never encountered this, but the font is pretty complex (and
    over-engineered) and I'm not sure it will help that much.

  body: Like Khaled, I've used cursive positioning in Arabic fonts and have not encountered
    the problem you describe or needed to do anything special in the font. The layout
    engine should look after this.
