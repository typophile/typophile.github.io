body: Is there an existing list of glyphs available somewhere, to see what glyphs
  are used in what languages? I would imagine it to be very helpful in designing fonts.
  I've found some advice in the web, but the information seems to be somewhat scattered
  to concerning only diacritics for example. If I'm creating a language support into
  a font, I'd like to know exactly what glyphs I need to design for that language.
  Some key issues to the design of the foreign characters would be a plus of course.

  body: Thanks, Decode Unicode is a good read towards what I'm looking for. I'm amazed
    that there isn't such a tool made from typography design point of view. At least
    for the common latin/western languages. So it seems that most fonts get away with
    Basic Latin, Latin-1 and Latin Extended A character sets?

  body: "Yes, that\u2019s about it. Actually, most fonts out there only manage Basic
    Latin and Latin-1. It seems that people get bored after designing just about that
    many glyphs, and then they move on to some other font.\r\n\r\nLatin Extended A
    gets supported for fonts that say they can handle \u201CCentral European\u201D,
    i.e. Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and a bunch of other European national languages.
    Anything beyond that is quite rare. I\u2019ve seen some fonts where only <em>parts</em>
    of Latin Extended A are supported, because the designer only cares about Czech
    and Polish but not Maltese or Romanian, for example. That\u2019s kind of annoying,
    but it\u2019s the designer\u2019s decision in the end, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThe worst
    offenders are fonts where the designer has made a token attempt at adding things
    but doesn\u2019t actually test them. An example is the Combining Diacritical Marks
    block, where sometimes a font includes most or all of the diacritics but the designer
    doesn\u2019t bother to add composed glyphs or instead properly use the mark feature.
    Then it looks at first glance like the font could support many more characters
    in composition, but it actually doesn\u2019t because the diacritics don\u2019t
    work as God and the Unicode committee intended.\r\n\r\nSome fonts have a small
    subset of the Combining Diacritical Marks, only the ones used in Western European
    languages, and then they don\u2019t work except for the precomposed characters
    in Latin-1 and Latin Extended A. This is generally because designers will use
    the CDM block as a sort of scrap space, storing the diacritics for use in designing
    the Latin-1 & LEA characters, and never considering that the presence of things
    in the CDM block implies functionality beyond those two ranges of precomposed
    glyphs. This behaviour is extremely common: try adding an acute accent to a lowercase
    n in your favorite fonts some day.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I\u2019m off on an irrelevant
    rant. But I do have an important point to make. IMNSHO if you\u2019re going to
    add a character you should endeavour to support it fully, and not just have it
    in there as a useless stub. In the case of fonts, nothing is better than broken
    and misleading."

    find this comment to be a bit peculiar. No font can realistically be expected
    to support <em> all </em> latin-based languages; each designer must therefore
    make decisions regarding which languages they will choose to support. What's odd
    about the above is that it suggests that those decisions should somehow revolve
    around the rather arbitrary grouping of languages into unicode blocks. Why is
    this more sensible than using geographical (e.g. Central European vs. Balkan/Mediterranean)
    or phylogenetic (e.g. Slavic vs. Romance/Semitic) criteria?\r\n\r\nI admit to
    being guilty of this view myself, insofar as I tend to add support for Esperanto
    just to fill out the Latin Extended A block despite the fact that this language
    ranks <em> very </em> low on my list of languages I'd want to support. On reflection,
    though, this really doesn't make much sense.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    of the project. Shame, really, because it would have been a nice resource had
    the project been continued.\r\n\r\n<em>For example, you would find \xE0 and \xE9
    in German but I tried to include only those characters that are \"native\" to
    that language.</em>\r\n\r\nTo be thorough, it would be useful to indicate which
    characters are marginal to a language. You would also find \xE0 and \xE9 in English,
    although they are not considered native letters. The same for \xE5, \u0161, and
    \u017E in Finnish, except that \xE5 does appear in the Finnish alphabet (which
    also includes a number of other letters not used for native Finnish words).\r\n\r\nIt's
    really complicated when you go through all these details. This is why it is useful
    to group several languages together and define the character set that will be
    sufficient for each of those languages. Hence the Western European, Central European
    and Baltic, etc. With something like African languages which are numerous and
    poorly documented, this is really the only possible approach; rather than trying
    to find out which characters are needed for each of hundreds of languages used
    in West Africa, it is more efficient to draw up a list of characters needed for
    several major West African languages. This is because regional and cultural groupings
    of languages tend to share characteristic letters.\r\n\r\nThe original poster
    talked about glyphs. Technically there is a difference between a glyph and a character,
    in that glyph refers to a particular shape of a character. The distinction is
    rather important because Unicode considers some similar characters used in different
    languages but with slightly different forms in each to be the same character.
    Depending on the language, uppercase Eng (\u014A) will either resemble \"N\" with
    a hook or an enlarged \"n\" with a hook that may or may not descend, but in Unicode
    all these glyphs are variants of the same character. So really, you do need to
    know which languages you intend to support, because that may determine how you
    draw the glyphs."

    \xE5 is part of the Finnish alphabet, regardless of the fact that it is not used
    for any native Finnish words. So are letters like c, q, w, x, and z, which don't
    occur in native Finnish words either. Yes, the fact that Finland is a bilingual
    country probably has a lot to do with why the Finnish alphabet includes letters
    not really used in the language. But I stated nothing controversial."
