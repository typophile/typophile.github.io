  is a type historian and critic (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/40358\">perhaps
  from Bethesda, Maryland</a>) who studied history at UC Berkeley, and more recently
  in Washington, DC. Crewdson created the popular blog [[Lines and Splines]] and later
  replaced it with [[New Series]]. He has been noticeably absent from typographic
  discussion and publishing since 2003, a fact bemoaned almost yearly with cries of
  \"Whatever happened to Andy Crewdson?\" on all the type blogs and forums.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion</strong>\r\n<a
