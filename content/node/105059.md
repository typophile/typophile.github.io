  body: "Here, I created this pattern swatch for ya...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/patternswatch_mottled.jpg\">\r\n\r\nI
    used a free texture source file from [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/36238268@N03/8515391170/in/set-72157632879691558|BittBox]]
    to create the mottled texture like in your sample. \r\n\r\nI imagine there's a
    filter for mottle pattersn in Ps (and perhaps Illy too), but hey ...\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
