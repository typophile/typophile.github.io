  of characters that include the / (forward slash) character, such as \"a3e/cf6\"
  (without the quotes). I want these character strings to be treated like a single
  word, without any breaks at line ends (hyphenation is off). Unfortunately, ID, in
  its wisdom, breaks the string thus \"a3e/\" with \"cf6\" wrapping to the next line.
  \r\n\r\nHow can I restrict ID to breaking lines only at spaces and at no other character?
  These strings appear several times in the text and any solution should ideally be
  global; it would be too much to manually process each of these occurences.\r\n\r\nAnd,
  apart from the forward slash, are there any other non-space characters at which
  ID breaks lines?"

  body: "Thanks, the discretionary hyphen solution did not work, perhaps because ID
    is assuming these to be two different words.\r\n\r\nBut selecting the whole string
    and applying \"No Break\" worked. Is there a way I can use a macro or find-and-replace
    command to apply No Break to any character string that has the \"/\" character
    in it? This is a 300-page book!\r\n\r\nThe / can appear anywhere in the string,
    even at the beginning. The string length can be up to 20 characters long. The
    source is in MS Word. I don't mind running a macro in Word before pasting in ID
    but can an ID \"No Break\" command even be pre-applied in Word?\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    ID should have a non-break \"/\". Much like a non-break space. Or a way of restricting
    the characters that should be allowed to break the line.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree that having a non-breaking \"/\" would help. We started breaking
    at slashes because of URLs. Other breaking characters are: slash(/), back-slash(\\),
    underscore(_), ellipse(...), commercial-at(@), any dash (en-dash, em-dash, etc).
    We also have some heuristics that allow breaks at periods that try to break URLs
    but not abbreviations.\r\nYou can use find/change to do the application of no-break
    (but you have to use GREP).\r\nIn the \"Find what:\" field of the GREP panel in
    Find-Change type these 5 chars: (./.)\r\nThis means \"an expression containing
    any character followed by / followed by any character\".\r\nIn the \"Change to:\"
    field enter: $1\r\nThis means \"use the first expression that was found\".\r\nNow,
    next to the \"Change Format:\" area, click the magnifier and choose \"no break\"
    from \"Basic Character Formats\"\r\nYou can hit the buttons \"Find\", \"Change\",
    \"Find Next\", \"Change\", ... until you feel comfortable enough to hit \"Change
    All\"\r\n\r\nBTW, in CS4 you can dynamically apply character formatting (like
    no-break) to GREP expressions. Powerful but somewhat daunting.\r\n\r\neric"

  body: "Thanks, Eric. Your solution worked. That's one more project that I can now
    migrate to ID from Ventura!\r\n\r\nYou mention that under some conditions lines
    also break at periods. What would be the solution to absolutely avoid this?\r\n\r\nI
    tried using the GREP solution you proposed by changing (./.) to (...) in the \"Find
    What\" field, but that did not work. The middle period was not interpreted literally
    but as a wildcard character."

  body: "Kimag, in case you haven't figured it out by now:\r\n\r\n<cite>The middle
    period was not interpreted literally but as a wildcard character.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    not just that middle period! The period \".\" is always a wildcard character,
    but in <em>Search</em> only. To search for a literal period, prefix it with a
    backspace. This must be used on <em>every</em> \"special\" character in the \"Search\"
    box as well as in the \"Replace\" box. An important note: the specials are different
    for Search and for Replace, i.e., while you can <em>Search</em> for a wildcard
    character, you cannot just <em>replace</em> it again with that \"same\" wildcard
    (\".\" to \".\"). The period in the replacement field is just that, a period.\r\n\r\nSo,
    to search for three periods in GREP mode, enter \"(\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.)\". (That would
    find three periods.) To search for 'any character period any character\", it gets
    slightly so complicated. If you grok the previous paragraph, you might think \".\\\\..\"
    does the trick. Well ... almost. The <em>space</em> also matches \"any character\"
    (as does, IIRC, the paragraph return), which would put \"No Break\" onto every
    last character plus period plus the next space. You might want to search here
    for a \"word\" character on the left and right of the period -- that's alphabetics
    plus numerics plus perhaps some loose change, and its wildcard in search mode
    is \"\\w\". Putting it together, that makes the Search \"(\\w\\\\.\\w)\" and the
    Replace \"$1\".\r\n\r\nBut wait! You don't have to put \"$1\" in the Replace field
    (which means \"the first parenthesized found expression), as there is only one
    item in the Search field that you want replaced entirely. You can remove the parentheses
    and use \"$0\" instead (which means \"the entire found expression\") [*]. But
    again, hey, all you want to change are <em>attributes</em>, so it is enough to
    entirely clear the Replace field, and just select \"No Break\" in the Replace
    with Format box. (Additional notes: if there is <em>no</em> text in the \"Replace
    With\" box and <em>no</em> formatting in the \"Replace with Formatting\" box,
    all found occurrences will be deleted. Also, be sure there is not a single --invisible--
    space in the Replace With box!)\r\n\r\nSo we end up with \"\\w\\\\.\\w\" in Search,
    nothing at all in Replace, and No Break in Replace with Format.\r\n\r\n[*] In
    case you are wondering how to use \"$1\" properly, this works nicely. Notice the
    escaped parentheses.\r\n\r\nSearch: \"\\((\\d+)\\)\"\r\nReplace: \"[$1]\"\r\n\r\nThis
    will search for \"(\", any sequence of numbers, then \")\", and replace it with
    Found Expression #1 -- which is the \"\\d+\" part --, surrounded by square brackets.
    In case you want to experiment with this any further, look up any standard GREP
    reference on the web (as InDesign is for the largest part compliant). For any
    variations on the above, remember the square brackets are 'special' in Search
    but not in Replace.\r\n\r\nTo have a little fun, try this. Search for \"(\\w\\w\\w)
    \\w+\\1\\>\". It will find any consecutive words with the same three ending characters
    (\"present management\", \"secure pressure\"; \"matter transmitter\" has four).
    Also try this one: \"(\\w)(\\w)(\\w)\\3\\2\\1\" -- this will find 'partly palindromes'
    -- words with the same three characters double in reverse order (\"dif\" in \"diffident\",
    \"tal\" in \"installation\")."

  body: "Theunis, thanks for taking the time to explain. Yes, I did figure out that
    preceding the character with a backslash (not \"backspace\" as you mistakenly
    typed) works by \"turning off the special meaning of the following character\".\r\n\r\nThanks
    too for pointing out the special case of anychar-period-space. I had completely
    overlooked it.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, I did spend several hours reading up on GREP.
    Fascinating!"

  body: "<cite>backslash (not \u201Cbackspace\u201D)</cite>\r\n\r\nEuh ...\r\n\r\nWhile
    I'm waiting for CS4, I'm thinking of smart things to do with the paragraph style
    linked GREP searches. So far, I've come up with two things that we now do manually:\r\n\r\n1.
    We regularly use old fonts, with its medieval numbers in a separate font. Naturally,
    we insert them as character styles with some search&replacing. Now, all we have
    to do is saying \"\\d\" -> \"Oldstyle\" character style in the style for our body
    text. Yippeee!\r\n\r\n2. It's quite handy to see figure and table references marked
    in color while doing page layout. How about \"([Ff]igure|[Tt]able)\\s\\d+)\" ->
    \"Highlite\", where the \"Highlite\" character style contains a big fat underline
    in some brilliant color. When done, de-select \"Underline\" in the highlite style,
    and the marks disappear. Need them again? Set \"Underline\" back on, and there
    they are again.\r\n\r\n(A provisional #3 would be to automatically format all
    caps words with small caps -- I could use that for <em>some</em> of my styles.)\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else? ;-)"
