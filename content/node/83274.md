  Web. I'm looking to use Sirba for headlines on my blog. I'll also be using the italics
  for use sparsely throughout for things like metadata and other small type. \r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a sans-serif pairing to go with Sirba for the body copy. Dagny comes
  to mind.\r\n\r\nI'm new to all of this, so go easy on me. And all ideas will be
  considered. I'm not locked into a sans to go with Sirba. I'd consider Sirba at a
  different weight as body copy or Sirba as the body copy and a sans as the headlines.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you guys think? Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nHere is the link to Sirba: http://typekit.com/fonts/sirba-web\r\nHere
