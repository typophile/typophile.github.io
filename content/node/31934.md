body: "Any recommendations? I'm interested in finding a high quality letterpress printer
  for short-run projects (social stationery, invitations, etc.). Digi-offset capabilities
  as well would be terrific, but I'm really looking for a solid letterpress shop.
  Well, in my dream world I'd be seeking a letterpress to purchase for my own use,
  but for now a printshop will have to do.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nerin\r\npaperina

    the art schools in Chicago? Someone on the faculties of those schools must be
    able to answer this one. \r\n\r\nAlso, IIRC The Paper Source does all of its letterpress
    printing in Chicago, and does things like stationary and invitations."
