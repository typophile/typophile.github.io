<div class=commentbody>Anonymous, <br> <br>I never would have thought of courier's lower-case z <br>as a candidate for my project. But really, the form <br>is quite interesting and could be "Hip". I thank you <br>for your comment. I will throw this into the pile of <br>zs I am collecting. <br> <br>Gerald, <br> <br>I was unable to locate a sample of the Thirty alt cap <br>Z that you speak of. Do you know of where I can see <br>a sample? <br> <br><i> > But I find it a bit odd that someone would take <br>on commercial work and then ask for free design <br>assistance from their peers.</i> <br> <br>I apologize if I have offended you or anyone else <br>regarding my inquiry. My intention is not to steal from <br>anyone that participates in Typophile but rather to <br>learn through the exchange of ideas. My post was intended <br>as somewhat of a continuation of the &lt;a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/8225.html?1049405322"> <br>ampersands &lt;/a> thread that <br>was posted earlier. Some very unique forms were posted that <br>I was previously unaware of. And no one ever really says <br>much about Zs. I thought it might be interesting to see <br>what people like about Z. I have a z in my name and have <br>never found a good way to use it. <br> <br>In my view, a lot of free design assistance happens around <br>here, particularly in the Design section of Typophile. Topics <br>such as <i> What serif faces go with Interstate?, Suggestions <br>for book typeface, Wine & typefaces</i> all seem to be asking <br>about the same sort of question as mine and all seem to be <br>paying jobs as well. <br> <br>Perhaps the letter </div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald, <br> <br>I agree with you on your choice of Z. It certainly would be interesting on <i>certain</i> wine labels. In France, though, people would automatically assume it was German/Alsacien wine. In the US, this is probably not the case. <br> <br>And Sean (Sean Michael?), <br> <br>I had approximately the same reaction to your first post as Gerald. This year, though, I'm giving people the benefit of the doubt and in your case it's paid off. <br> <br>Unfortunately, you gave the impression that you hadn't done any research yourself and wanted other people to do your work for you. Even worse, perhaps, you also gave the impression that you don't know much about what you are doing. <br> <br>I think, your second post cleared most of this up. That said, I think you have a point about the amount of people looking for free advice in here. <br> <br>Good luck in your project and don't forget to let us know when you've come up with something. <br> <br>Matha. <br> <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>i don't think anybody here is looking for other's to do their work for them. they are looking for advice, inspiration, and education, which every single designer does by the way. be it when talking with their colleges, flipping through a magazine, or reading a book. i always believed this board was about the exchange of ideas which may eventually be put to use. but i guess design is a business, and a copetitive one at that and in this culture everything comes at a cost.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Anonymous <br> <br>Despite Stephen's admonition, I think this is an interesting exchange about something not often discussed here. <br> <br>It's not just that design is a business, which it most definitely is, and a very competitive one. "Cost" is not specific to our culture but has been around ever since the idea of the "marketplace" and the beginning of "culture." <br> <br>But, let's say Sean liked the Goudy Thirty alt Z and used it in his client's piece. Yeah, he gets the money. But more importantly, he gets the credit for the design. And based on this, he may even pull in other work, undeservedly, in this regard. I doubt he'd actually feel good about that. <br> <br>There isn't anything new under the sun, and yes, ideas and inspiration generally come from our exposure to the work of our peers. But there is a bit of a difference in how this is working here. Its one thing to show a piece and humbly ask for a critique, its another to ask others to contribute to your work and then take credit for it. I'm sure Sean understands this based on his recent post. <br> <br>I certainly am inspired by the work of others and will drawn upon what I find useful, but quite frankly, I would never ask someone for design advice as I don't know how I could then say the piece was my own work (for better or worse). And this has got nothing to do with money.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> he gets the credit for the design <br> <br>Not necessarily. Although it's not reasonable to give public/explicit/formal credit for every bit of inspiration a designer unavoidably gets, ethically it's expected of anybody who benefits beyond a certain threshold to state his debt, and there's no reason to assume Sean wouldn't do the right thing. To me asking isn't so bad - but pretending you didn't ask is indeed a big problem. <br> <br>And if somebody wants to actually share any resultant "wealth" that would be even more commendable. Maybe a small donation to Typophile? For example, my own membership payment here has little to do with getting yet another cool t-shirt. <br> <br>It's really all a matter of reasonable behavior, not satisfying every person and every Law out there. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Gee. Who would have thought it would come to this. Not me. <br> <br>I was on a tight deadline today and was not able to comment. <br>However, it was great fun to see the other comments add up <br>when I was occasionally able to check in. <br> <br>To those who have pointed towards some Zeds, thank you. I <br>will be sure not use your ideas</div>
