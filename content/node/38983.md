  body: I've not actually used Tallys before; as for a comment all I can say is it
    certainly doesn't suck.

    to complain.

  body: It's interesting how many respectable text faces have popped up in the free
    font world over the last few weeks. But, like metalfoot says, none of these have
    true italics, small caps, or even a proper bold, so their usefulness for body
    copy is limited.

    about <a href=\"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontinsans.html\">Fontin Sans</a>?
    It has all of these. Well, it\u2019s a sans, but a) one of those that might work
    quite well as text face (though I haven\u2019t tested it myself) and b) <a href=\"http://exljbris.wordpress.com/2007/03/10/fontin-serif/\">Fontin
    Serif</a> will follow someday (not to confuse with the hybrid <a href=\"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html\">Fontin</a>).\r\nJos

  body: "Tallys must be regarded more as an experiment. It's quite quirky but I think
    it has a certain charm. I myself wouldn't use it as a text face.\r\n\r\nA few
    months ago I recieved [[http://www.masterkeysystem.de|this book]] which was completely
    set in Fontin & Fontin Sans. They work very well as text faces. On the same site
    I found a [[http://www.masterkeysystem.de/pdf/Das%20Master%20Key%20System%20-%20Leseprobe.pdf|pdf]]
    sample of Fontin in use (it's not a pdf of the book unfortunately) and also some
    screens ([[http://www.masterkeysystem.de/downloads/wp/1024/Gedanke%20ist%20Ursache.jpg|here's
    one]]) of Fontin Sans SC in use.\r\n\r\n<cite>Jos is a crazy Tausendsassa. ;\xB0)</cite>\r\nHad
    to wiki that, but that's a lot of credit :-)\r\n\r\n<cite>Fontin looks like it
    could be a rare exception. I\u2019ll try to give it a decent test soon.</cite>\r\nPlease
    do and keep me/us posted (if it's ok with Erik, because it's a bit off topic)."

  body: "Lack of italic, small caps and bold is certainly an issue, but to me Tallys
    looks less quirky at text sizes than Fontin. That's not to say I don't like Fontin,
    but if I had to choose one or the other for extended text, I'd go with Tallys.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    many thanks to Jos for offering such fine typefaces for free. "

    gone through with the donation. Not donating feels almost like stealing the fonts.

    used Tallys at a small text size, but I'll take a look this week to see if I've
    missed something here :-)\r\n\r\n@ Tom: Thanks (again)!"
