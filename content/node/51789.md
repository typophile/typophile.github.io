  (Red Rooster) via Veer.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=RRT0011538\">Veer</a>\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/laramie-pro/\">MyFonts</a>\r\n\r\nI
  ask is Veer a better version or better reproduced, would love to know.\r\nNormally
  I would just get it from Veer (even though I don't get the benefits of living in
  the US, that is another story or posting), though this time could not justify it,
  not for the job it is required for.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

  body: Someone from the respective outfits can correct me if I'm wrong, but I am
    fairly certain the Red Rooster font files via Veer or via RR themselves are the
    same. There is also a version of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Laramie">Laramie</a>
    from URW which is probably slightly different.

  body: Whoops. Clicked your MyFonts link and now I see that version is from "profonts"
    which is owned by URW, so it might actually be the same as the URW version at
    FontShop.  Clicking on the Red Rooster/Veer about tab shows that it is also the
    Profonts version. So my conclusion is that these three shops are selling the same
    fonts. You should make your decision based on whichever vendor you enjoy and trust
    the most.

    to send me the cushions or the promos, ha...  \r\nhave gone MyFonts as the job
    is a small one. NZ dollar sucks!"
