  to ask for help in identifying a font, but I'm really fond of ancient documents'
  fonts (books, legal documents, etc.) and I'm currently having troubles with one
  belonging to a Certificate of Birth of the Territory of Hawaii dated 1904. \r\nI'm
  looking for a match, or at least a reasonably similar alternative, to the font used
  for \"TERRITORY OF HAWAII.\" in the attached picture. I don't even know how to classify
  such a font... shadowed? inlined? engraved? My manifest ignorance about typefaces
  made almost impossible for me to even find an appropriate category where similar
  fonts can be sought. \r\nTo be accurate, I'm looking for a font resembling the one
  shown in the picture and having the same \"shadow effect\".\r\nAny help will be
  very appreciated! Thank you very much for your attention and kindness. \r\n\r\nAlessandro.\r\n"

    Many of us won't answer them here, just on principle.\r\n\r\nAlso, that's shadow,
    not inline."
