    <BR>In 1969 Michael Caine starred in a stylish comic crime film called The Italian
    Job - the character he played was called Charlie Croker - and delivered some celebrated
    one-liners such as: <BR>&#34;You&#39;re only supposed to blow the bloody doors
    off!&#34; <BR>and <BR>&#34;Yes, I used a machine gun&#34;  <BR>&#40;Obviously
    these only make any sense if you watch the movie, but maybe they&#39;ll make you
    curious enough to seek it out&#41;. <BR>The film is also notable for its curious
    ending - during filming, it was decided that the original ending didn&#39;t leave
    enough room for a sequel, so a new ending was invented and filmed. <BR>The ending
    was written by the producer because there wasn&#39;t enough money to pay the writer
    any more, and the director hated it so much he made his assistant film the closing
    scenes. <BR>Wierdly, the ending is one of the things most people really remember
    about the film, and the sequel was never made anyway. <BR>The trailer for the
    2003 &#39;remake&#39; of the Italian Job promises nothing in the way of a good
    film in itself, let alone a suitable tribute to something that the British cinema-going
    public hold dear. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0064505" target="_blank">The
