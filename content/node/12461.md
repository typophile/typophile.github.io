  was designed by [[Adrian Frutiger]] and [[Akira Kobayashi]], and released by [[Linotype
  Library]] in 2004. The type family is a complete revision of Frutiger's [[Avenir]]
  (1988), and is part of [[Linotype Library]]'s [[Platinum Collection]].\r\n\r\nAdrian
  Frutiger designed the original [[Avenir]] for Linotype in 1988. It is based on an
  amalgamation of [[Futura]] and [[Erbar]]. Frutiger had never been happy with the
  cold, modern appearance of Futura, so he \"humanized\" it. \r\n\r\nAvenir Next has
  a better distribution of weight across the family than Avenir did. The fonts also
  have small caps and old style figures in them. Each weight also has a condensed
  variant. No true [[italic]] styles were made though, just [[oblique]] ones. This
  seems in keeping with most of Frutiger's other typefaces.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html\">Avenir
