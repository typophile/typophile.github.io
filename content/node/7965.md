  body: Wow. I was thinking about asking a very similar question. Yeah, there are
    some very respected type designers on this board and I, too, would love to know
    what your thought process and workflow looks like. <BR> <BR>For example, do you
    start with a sketch or go straight to the vectors? Do you create individual glyphs
    in a program external to fontlab et al. &#40;Illustrator, Freehand&#41; then import
    the eps into fontlab? Do you start with any specific glyph? Do you cut and paste
    components of one glyph into another or draw each separately &#40;serifs, stems,
    ascenders, things that in some faces, anyway, are modular&#41;? Come on, spill
    it!

  body: Aaron, mechanically you seem to be on the right track &#40;although honestly
    that&#39;s not very hard&#41;, but ideologically, or perhaps even spiritually
    in a way, to me the key to &#34;real&#34; type design is grasping the part-versus-whole
    nature of the way in which individual signs come together to create &#34;visible
    language&#34;, the way in which the balancing of positive and negative &#40;notan&#41;
    leverages human cognition to full effect. Don&#39;t ask me to elaborate any more,
    because I&#39;m still in the forest myself. But at least I know I&#39;m lost.
    :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Without this sort of meta-understanding you can still make type
    that many people will love and even purchase, but it will be a shadow, or better
    a silhouette, of what type really is. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, there have been
    some Typophile threads in the past with great mechanical insight - hopefully one
    of our archive hounds will bring those up. I tend to have lousy luck with the
    archives here. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;m not sure anybody wants to hear about my process, because I haven&#39;t
    actually released anything yet, but here goes. <BR> <BR>Almost all of my fonts
    in the <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/">pipeline</a> are digitizations
    of existing faces, primarily from the ATF catalog. <BR> <BR>The first step in
    the process is to make extremely  high quality scans. I&#39;m fortunate to have
    an Epson 4870 for other work. I usually scan at 2400 dpi and save as JPEG with
    quality 90. The resulting files are around 40M per page, and are thus a bit cumbersome
    to work with, but I figure I&#39;m not losing much. <BR> <BR>Next I decide which
    font size is going to be considered the &#34;master&#34;. All these fonts are
    optically scaled, so there is a very significant difference between a 12pt text
    showing and the same font in display at 48pt. Often, I&#39;m able to make an educated
    guess as to which size was the original master; for example, for Century Catalogue
    and Bodoni Book, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s 18pt. <BR> <BR>I then take a careful
    series of measurements, largely to understand the inner logic of the optical scaling.
    If I do this right, then I get a set of scaling parameters I can use to make the
    images of any size line up with the master. Of course, enlarging small sizes won&#39;t
    have the same quality as working from larger masters, and the corners in particular
    can get pretty beaten up, but I think it works. The Century Catalog is drawn from
    originals ranging all the way from 12pt to 36pt, and I feel like I&#39;ve mostly
    evened out the inconsistencies. <BR> <BR>To start work on an individual glyph,
    I start by choosing one or more exemplars. This is actually one of the toughest
    parts, as the printing quality can vary widely between the different samples of
    the same font, especially if there are differences in paper. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    a new trick I usually use these days, which is to carefully align multiple scans
    of the same letter, then average them together. Currently, I do this by hand in
    the Gimp, but I expect I will write a tool to automate this for me. It&#39;s labor
    intensive, but the results can be striking. <BR> <BR>When I finally get an image,
    I start tracing. Most of the fonts are done in FontForge, but I&#39;ve just now
    started using my prototype Cornu spline based curve editor. However, that tool
    is lacking much functionality, so I&#39;ll probably be stuck moving the outlines
    into FontForge for a while to make them into a real font. <BR> <BR>I spend a lot
    of time nudging the outlines until I get the curvature to look just right. I usually
    make test prints, both at the size of the original so I can compare them, and
    at around 200pt so I can audit for problems. I have become somewhat fanatical
    about matching the original. For example, I invite anyone with a 1929 Centaur
    specimen booklet to compare the 72pt printed metal with <a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/centaur-test.pdf">my
    draft</a>. I&#39;m inclined to soften the points on the &#39;a&#39;, and make
    the stroke on the &#39;e&#39; heavier, but both of these quirks can be found in
    the original. <BR> <BR>I do not tend to cut and paste a lot. Most of the fonts
    I&#39;m tracing have enough individual variation that copying doesn&#39;t really
    save time. <BR> <BR>The last step is the spacing. Most of the fonts in my pipeline
    need a lot more work on this. I have been doing it pretty much by seat-of-the-pants,
    but I expect to be following the procedure outlined in Chapter 10 of Tracy&#39;s
    &#34;Letters of Credit&#34;. <BR> <BR>Now maybe one of the great designers can
    weigh in. Heck, I&#39;ll settle for a good one :<a href="http://rotten.com/"></a>&#41;

    reason it is probably easier to learn than Fontlab, which I&#39;ve had a chance

    the de facto standard with capabilities not present in FOG, like Open Type support?

  body: 'Noah, I strongly recommend that you forget about Fontographer. It simply
    is not worth learning this I suggest that you either start with TypeTool &#40;the
    cheaper, stripped down version of FontLab&#41; or go direct to FontLab. &#40;You
    could also download the demo of DTL FontMaster, in case this appeals to you more.&#41;
    I recommend getting a copy of Leslie Cabarga&#39;s <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0965762858">Learn
    FontLab Fast</a>,</i> which will make learning to use FontLab much easier. <BR>
    <BR>You&#39;ll find that different type designers have different approaches to
    the design process, and also that processes might vary depending on the typeface
    itself. For instance, I do almost all my work directly in FontLab, with very little
    drawing on paper, while some other designers always do quite detailed drawings.
    If I do drawings on paper, they tend to be quite rough, and are just to help me
    get possible shapes clear in my head.&#42; <BR> <BR>If you are going to start
    your design on paper, which is a good idea when you are beginning, do not feel
    that you need to produce high quality, &#39;finished&#39; artwork. It is nice
    to look at lovely outline or inked drawings by great draughtsmen like Hermann
    Zapf, but these need to be understood as artifacts of industrial manufacturing
    processes. My recommendation for digital font development is to follow the older
    practice from the days of the manual punchcutter: make only rough drawings, and
    allow the refinement to come out in the outlines you make on the computer. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>&#42; If I&#39;m designing for a script I have not worked with before
    &#40;I do a lot of multilingual type design&#41;, I tend to spend time writing
    it with appropriate instruments, in order to understand the development of the
    script relative to the tools with which it has been written.'

  body: Fontographer is not capable of producing what is today an &#34;ideal end result.&#34;
    FontLab on the other hand probably doesn&#39;t produce results with &#34;a minimum
    of fuss,&#34; either. DTL FontMaster is rather expensive, placing it beyond the
    reach of most hobbiests and folks just getting started. <BR> <BR>Overall, I&#39;d
    suggest getting FontLab, or getting TypeTool if you can&#39;t afford FontLab.
    <BR> <BR>Beyond that, what John said. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Particularly about the design process. <BR> <BR>For myself,
    I fundamentally design in my head. I may make some sketches and such to clarify
    my ideas, but I don&#39;t actually bother scanning these in. Like John I tend
    to then sit down and work directly on the computer. <BR> <BR>I have noticed that
    &#42;on average&#42; the question of how one approaches design is a function of
    age and background. Type designers who were born before 1960 and/or have significant
    calligraphy or hand-lettering background almost all tend to draw things out pretty
    carefully first and digitize later &#40;perhaps much later&#41;. Of type designers
    born in 1970 or later, without any hand-lettering background, many work directly
    on the computer without starting a design in analog form. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>

    Thomas speaks of isn&#39;t an absolute, I was born in early 1944 and have a caligraphy/handlettering
    background.  I rarely draw letter-forms on paper at all anymore.  I either start
    straight in FontLab or Illustrator with a blank screen and just  draw. Some of
    us geezers just mess up the rules :-&#41; <BR>The point is, it does not matter
    a hoot how anyone else works, do what ever works for you.  Try several ways.  However
    you start, you will learn from it.  You can change your work process later.  I
    did, I used to work with just 2 brushes and black and white paint.  The important
    thing is to learn to &#34;see&#34;.  Work, then look, then fix, then look, then

  body: Mine is a somewhat confused process... <BR> <BR>I was born in &#39;75 but
    studied architectural drafting fairly extensively; There&#39;s no way I could
    ever draw an entire typeface on paper &#40;I wish I could though&#41;, instead
    I&#39;ve found myself using a technique where I&#39;ll draw &#40;on paper&#41;
    two or three or four &#34;key&#34; glyphs, scan them, put them as a background
    in FontLab, and simply manual trace from there.  At that point &#40;and after
    some polishing of the shape in FontLab&#41; I can interpolate the shapes I want
    in the other characters from the shapes I drew and scanned. <BR> <BR>This works
    for me, and I find it very relaxing and meditative &#40;nothing beats seeing those
    smooth-as-silk vectors take their place over that rough bitmap ghost&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve been doing something kinda wacky lately, too.  I&#39;ll photocopy-magnify
    my handwritten &#40;ballpoint and broadnib pens&#41; glyphs, polish them up with
    a black marker and a whiteout pen, scan them, and do the routine that I laid out
    above. <BR> <BR>Again, it works for me, but we&#39;re all different.

  body: 'Unless I&#39;m digitizing an existing face, I start with lots of sketches
    and doodles. Nothing very finished-looking usually, and I often use lined paper
    &#40;legal pads&#41; or graph paper. At some point, I have a solid idea in my
    head what the font looks like &#40;or ideally looks like&#41; from doing the doodles
    and sketches.  <BR> <BR>Then I start working directly in FontLab, sometimes putting
    scans of the sketches in the background as a reference. I generally don&#39;t
    literally trace the scans, but they are a big help in getting proportions correct.
    Plus it helps psychologically not to have to start from a blank screen and to
    have some concrete idea what I&#39;m shooting for. I am capable of doing very
    tight drawings--my early lettering work was all ink on board--but I find it much
    more efficient and flexible to do the tight stuff on the computer screen. The
    sketches are really more like visual notes than artwork. <BR> <BR>I worked in
    Fontographer for years using Illustrator for drawing, and then copying and pasting
    between them. This was mainly because I disliked Fontographer&#39;s drawing environment.
    I&#39;ll second Eric&#39;s advice to draw directly in the font program. Since
    I started doing it, I can&#39;t believe how much more efficient it is. &#40;And
    thanks to Eric and some others for encouraging me to give it a try. I used to
    be so hung up on the difficulties of moving art from Illustrator to FontLab, it
    kept me from dumping Fontographer for years.&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, and for the record,
    I was born in 1955 and started using a computer to design type in 1985 &#40;Fontographer
