body: "This is a book from the Central Saint Martins Archive. As i say in the title
  it is a book by Jonas Kortens. Titled Incunabula and Old books and was printed in
  1743. \r\n\r\nThe current archive lecturer didn't know much about this book other
  then the details i have given here. Despite its poor condition its really beautiful
  and really worth a look. If anybody can translate any of the content that would
  be much appreciated or any information at all about the blackletter type would also
  be helpful. \r\n\r\nIf not just enjoy these images of a beautiful old book. (more

  body: Thanks. If anyone can help on any of the other images (any information) i
    am still looking for a bit more knowledge about the book. Its quite interesting
    to draw comparisons with dexter sinister. Re-publishing out of print material
    just as this Incunabula is.
