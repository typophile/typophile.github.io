  wondering if anybody could identify the type from this book printed in 1965. What
  the font suggested Pevensey 5 Heavy or Times Europa, but it's clearly neither.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any suggestions!"

  body: Great. Thanks so much! I checked some Bodonis earlier but the serifs weren't
    quite the same. Much appreciated.

  body: "<em>Curious: why Linotype?</em>\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it looks like it.\r\nAnd
    then I guess the most common Bodonis of the predigital era were Linotype\u2019s
    and Bauer\u2019s.\r\nI could be wrong.\r\nBut it\u2019s not Bauer Bodoni."

    mark.
