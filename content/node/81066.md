body: "I'm going to do my Graphic Design master thesis on comic book typography. The
  small amount of googling and digging around I've done so far (I just started) in
  libraries and online databases hasn't resulted in a lot of information. Most how-to
  books have a chapter on hand lettering but I haven' t been able to find books exclusively
  dedicated to the subject. \r\n\r\nAny hints on literature, comic book artists who
  do their own digital typefaces or are especially creative with use of type (Chris
  Ware and Will Eisner come to mind - who else?) would be greatly appreciated. Name
  your favorites!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The one thing I know is that, since word bubbles are often lettered in all
    caps, the capital I with serifs is to be used only for the personal pronoun. I
    know I read that rule somewhere. I'll try to get back to you with a source.\r\n\r\nI
    think an I with serifs might be OK in Roman numerals too, but you'd have to ask
    your editor about that."

    book fonts. Since the book is from 2003, the software discussed in the book is
    no longer current, but most of the "how to" is still valid. '

  body: "Two of my favourites for lettering:\r\n\r\nCharles Schulz\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schulz_5138.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge
    Herriman\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Krazy_6397.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    realise these might not count if you are making a strict difference between comic
    books and newspaper comic strips.\r\nIn the British comics I read in the '70s,
    which were mainly collections of single page stories, the artists nearly always
    did their own lettering. Leo Baxendale, Reg Parlett and Ken Reid were particularly
    good for titles of monster and horror strips. There are lots of examples of these
    in Rian Hughes' [[http://www.fiell.com/page/our-books/typography/60s-lettering|Custom
    Lettering of the '60s & '70s]]."

  body: "Thanks for the replies, very good references! I haven't quite yet defined
    how wide the subject would be but I'm interested in both digital typography (which
    I have done myself to some extent) and hand lettering (which would be useful to
    learn well). \r\n\r\nI'll definitely purchase the comiccraft book. I'd really
    like to create my own digital typeface for use on the production part of the thesis
    (which will be an actual comic book).\r\n\r\nWhen thinking of the classic handwritten
    comic book style, do you know of any digital fonts that use opentype features
    such as alternating characters (when you have two same glyphs after one another)
    in order to crete a truly handwritten feel? I'll contact blambot and comiccraft
    as suggested by jasonc on this but it would be nice to hear user comments on such
    typefaces also."

  body: "Ville,\r\n\r\nYearly, the Will Eisner Awards (sort of the Oscars for the
    comics industry) offer an award for best lettering.  \r\n\r\nHere are the nominees
    for 2011:\r\n\r\nBest Lettering\r\n\r\n- Darwyn Cooke, Richard Stark's Parker:
    The Outfit (IDW)\r\n- Dan Clowes, Wilson (Drawn & Quarterly)\r\n- Jimmy Gownley,
    Amelia Rules!: True Things (Adults Don't Want Kids to Know), Amelia Rules!: The
    Tweenage Guide to Not Being Unpopular, by Jimmy Gownley (Atheneum/Simon & Schuster)\r\n-
    Todd Klein, Fables, The Unwritten, Joe the Barbarian, iZombie (Vertigo/DC); Tom
    Strong and the Robots of Doom (WildStorm/DC); SHIELD (Marvel); Driver for the
    Dead (Radical)\r\n- Doug TenNapel, Ghostopolis (Scholastic Graphix)\r\n- Chris
    Ware, Acme Novelty Library 20: Lint (Drawn & Quarterly)\r\n\r\nI suspect digging
    around to find the past 20 years of nominees and winners would be a good place
    to start.  Many of the artists you could approach directly through personal web
    sites and blogs.\r\n\r\nbest of luck and let us know your results.\r\n\r\n"

    his artwork (except once to make fun of the practice). Clever, though, whoever
