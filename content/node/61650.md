    simply, and recognizable. \r\n\r\nI would emphasize line since it is in the name
    of the company. \r\n\r\nHere are some inspiration resources that I like:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.logolounge.com/trends/2009/images/Logo-Trends-Candy.jpg]]\r\n\r\n#1

- body: "Help? Always know your audience. The people you're appealing to are <strong>all
    that matters</strong>, and who YOU are in that message is NOBODY. If the business
    is selling steak, don't factor in that you're a vegetarian. If the audience is
    Mac lovers, don't factor in the fact you love techno fonts from the eighties.
    \r\n\r\nIn that same vein, I think you'd get a better response here if you stopped
    writing in texting shorthand. This forum has an international membership and things
    like \"u plz\" or \"wdut\" are pure gibberish to people who speak several languages.
    Furthermore, look around. This forum is full of typographers, book designers,
    and people obsessed with things like apostrophes and the proper use of a hyphen
    vs. an en dash. They all knew, before you google it, that an en dash exists and
    what it's purpose is. In short, people who love written English and have little
    tolerance for mangling it. I suspect several read your top post and clicked away
    immediately thinking \"why bother?\"\r\n\r\nSorry if this doesn't help much with
    your logo, but I think it might help you become a better designer. I don't mean
    to offend. I know texting is common, but it's not always appropriate. \r\n\r\nKnow
    your audience. "

    brand buyers.\r\n\r\nThe name might be problematic too. How much leeway do you
    have in changing the name?"
