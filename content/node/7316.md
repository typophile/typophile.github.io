  is a little old. What is the field like now for OSX font management? Especially
  for those who are designing fonts

  body: I HATE how OSX deals with fonts...especially FontBook.  I don&#39;t know what
    I did, or how I did it in FontBook but I got rid of a font or changed a font or
    something and I don&#39;t know how to fix it.  Now certain webpages display Helvetica
    Fractions unless I disable Helvetica

    <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right. There still isn&#39;t an ATM Deluxe replacement for
    OS X.  <BR>But I&#39;ll bet you haven&#39;t tried the <a href="http://typographi.com/000858.php"
    target="_blank">newest FontAgent Pro</a>. <BR>Do I sound broken record yet?

  body: The activating/deactivating aspect of the question is key. <BR>As type designers
    we&#39;re contstantly loading and unloading <BR>minor variations of a single typeface.
    OSX seems to really <BR>hate this. I&#39;ve licensed Suitcase and FontAgent Pro.
    Both <BR>are ok, but Font Cache cleaner is the new type designers friend. <BR><a

    hold your breath. Not so sure this is good for activation of any sort.'

  body: I&#39;ll take a look at that Stephen, thanks.  And thanks Eric, I&#39;m going
    to have to try that and see if it fixes my helvetica problem. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s
    hope FontBook two is better than 1.  What I&#39;d love would be transparent font
    management.  IE, put EVERY font you have into one folder designated for fonts,
    and have them all deactivated but listed as available to be used programmes.  When
    you choose to use one, it activates it until you&#39;re not using it anymore then
    it gets deactivated.  The user never even knows what&#39;s going on.

  body: I can chime in about the ol&#39; Master Juggler OSX. There is something very
    simple and clean about the interface. It&#39;s stripped down in terms of its capability,
    which I like. No font activation. You have to do that manually. Which I like.  <BR>
    <BR>I had assumed, as a result of this simplicity, that it would be speedy and
    reliable. And it&#39;s not. I&#39;ve had lots of problems installing TrueType
    fonts as well. The Font Guardian feature, which analyzes the fonts upon installation,
    does not seem to understand TrueType. It asks for PostScript outline files on
    installation. Wha? And the whole program freezes up from time to time, I assume
    as a result of &#34;bad&#34; fonts. And its display of font samples, while pretty,
    is slow and cumbersome. It&#39;s disappointing. I&#39;m praying that Alsoft will
    come out some sort of update

  body: Wait. &#39;install&#39; is not the right word... It&#39;s more of an import.
    Because Master Juggler doesn&#39;t move your fonts to some other location upon
    import. I can&#39;t remember if Suitcase does that or not. I remember Font Reserve
    did that. Font Book seems to kidnap your fonts.   <BR> <BR>Stephen, is there something
    better or different about the newest FontAgent Pro?

  body: I mean, maybe I&#39;m being really impatient or picky. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s
    just that you feel as though you have to tiptoe around Master Juggler.

  body: Thats not picky!  You pay the bucks for solid font management, and that is
    what you expect. Not some crappy dribbly program that does a half arsed job.

    But it is dribbly! And it does about a 2/3 arse job.

  body: The main difference between MasterJuggler and FontAgent Pro <BR>is that the
    latter features auto-activation, which can save a  <BR>bundle of time for users
    with a variety of fonts and jobs. <BR> <BR>FAP does not require movement of your
    fonts for import. It does, <BR>however, make a copy of the fonts before import
    if you choose <BR>not to allow it to move them. No biggie.

    have a nicely organized folder somewhere on your computer, with your collection
    of lovely fonts, and FontAgent Pro uses those files. I like the idea of that.
    It&#39;s simple. But perhaps, there is a reason to make a copy of the font file,
    as opposed to using your original files? Hmmm....  <BR> <BR>I guess my only other
    question is, is there anything you don&#39;t like about it? There has to be something.

    not like Font Reserve&#39;s Vault. You can access  <BR>it like any other folder.
    It&#39;s just up to you whether or not you  <BR>want it to be your only directory
