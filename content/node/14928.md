  body: "I also agree about about the ITC styled ligature, but the logo is not one
    single typeface, but a blending of several with a little custom work. \r\n\r\nIMO,
    it has the \"TH\" ligature of ITC Avant Garde Gothic, and \"I\"\r\nIt uses either
    the <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kabel/heavy/testdrive.html?s=THING&p=48+
    target=\"new\">Kabel</a> or ITC Kabel cap \"N\" or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-serif-gothic/bold/testdrive.html?s=THING&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">ITC Serif Gothic</a> cap \"N\" and squared off the terminals.\r\n\r\nThe
    cap \"G\" is treated similar to the cap \"G\" in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/kabel-dtcondensed/kabel-dt-condensed/testdrive.html?s=THING&p=48\"
    target=\"new\">Kable DT Condensed</a>\r\nand could have be modified by using the
    \"G\" from either Serif Gothic or Kabel.\r\n\r\nBut then again, we may be missing
    a single typeface that has all of the above.\r\n"

  body: "ITC Avant Garde Gothic, Serif Gothic, Kabel, Ronda, Lubalin Graph... and
    I used to think these faces were so unique!\r\n\r\nNow you can mix and match them
    within the same sentence and most readers wouldn't even notice. This gives new
    meaning to the old \"type should be invisible\" saying.\r\n"

  body: THING is based on Ronda. The ligature is drawn off of Ronda, not another typeface.
    MAKING is hand drawn. Nothing is invisible.
