  I am studying the Master of visual communication. It needs an evaluation when I
  finished the first two stages of study. So, I made a homepage for the evaluation.
  You can see the website underneath this letter. My topic is The Language of Water
  In Visual Communication. There some interpretation of the experimental process and
  effect. I hope you can give me your comment, it will help me find areas of improvement
  in the last stage of my study. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Chi Chen, based on my first impressions I think your topic needs to be moved,
    so I moved it. Interesting idea. How did you come to it?

    or it can mean relief from drought or flood. Water isn't static nor is its definition
    and it effects our lives on a daily basis. Today in Manhattan the heat index will
    be over 100\xBA, drinking water will be essential."

  body: "While I appreciate (I hope) some of what you are trying to investigate, too
    much is lost by your incomplete command of English, please don't be insulted or
    discouraged, but I feel that for anyone to meaningfully discuss your work you
    need to put it in a way that can be understood. Why, for example, should water
    be unpredictable, physics and fluid mechanics show us some very predictable properties
    of water that will only change given the presence of impurities or atmospheric
    pressure. None of your experiments revealed anything about water that could not
    be predicted to some degree. It would have been far more startling to have exactly
    reproduced the centrifugal effect of water on discs, than to have shown that on
    differing materials under differing circumstances water behaves in differing ways.
    I don't feel that you have approached the effects of water on emotions or psyche
    in any meaningful way.\r\nI apologise if you think this criticism is unwarranted.\r\nTim"
