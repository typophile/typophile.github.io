  body: "I really dig your font. A few of the characters have legibility issues...
    but who cares!\r\n\r\nI do have a question... \r\n\r\nThe font seems slightly
    different between the poster and the pdf specimen. Did you alter the font in Illustrator/Photoshop
    for the poster? Or is it a different version/weight of the font? I definitely
    think it benefits from a little breathing space in the counters, which also improves
    the legibility quite a bit (not that legibility matters, really).\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks. The poster on flickr is a Herb Lubalin poster, not mine. I referred
    to it for guidance on certain letters when I made my font (the pdf). I was not
    attempting to recreate the poster's characters into a font. although, maybe i
    should try and offer that as another style in the family!

  body: "Oh... OK... now I get it. I guess I skipped a few words when I read it.\r\n\r\nIt
    could definitely use more negative space. At smaller sizes, the hairline counters
    disappear.\r\n\r\nX and Y look the same at small sizes.\r\n\r\nThe height of counters
    and serifs aren't consistent across the alphabet. Half of the letters have short
    counters, the other half have tall counters.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase letters are
    nice. Really nice. The \"r\" seems a bit weak, but I'm not sure how it could be
    improved. \r\n\r\nOf course, this isn't a text font and I feel that if most of
    the letters are workable, then it's a victory.\r\n\r\nI think if you open up the
    counters and let them breathe a bit, that will make a huge difference.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn
    a side note, if you have time, could you take a look at a font I did and give
    a few words of feedback?\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/63238"
