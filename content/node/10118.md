  body: Don&#39;t you hate when you just know the face but don&#39;t know what it&#39;s
    called? This took me far too long, but it&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/windsor/d-bold/testdrive.html?s=STEVE%2BMILLER%2BBAND&amp;p=36">Windsor
    bold</a>. I just ran across it the other day while looking for another font for
    this forum, too. Good thing for me Coles, Yves, Tiffany, and the rest of you sleuthers
    were asleep or out having fun. <BR> <BR>Next time, John, a slightly larger specimen
    if possible.
