  across a lettered list that skipped the letter 'J'. At the time I thought it was
  just a typo, but I've just read Jan Tschichold's essay \"Consistent Correlation
  Between Book Page and Type Area\" and there's also a list that skips 'J'. Googling
  turned out nothing so, so I'm hoping someone here might provide some insight on
  why it's done this way in (at least) Swiss German."

    use of a J-shaped |I| at the beginning of words.\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/initialiwithhook/\r\n"

  body: When you say a "lettered list", is it possible that there were simply no entries
    in the list which began with that letter?

  body: "The letter \"J\" was only relatively recently distinguished from \"I\". In
    Fraktur in particular, the capital I and J are often very similar or identical,
    so it might cause confusion to distinguish them in indexing. Here's a reference
    specific to German:\r\n http://feefhs.org/guides/German_Gothic.pdf \r\n\r\nIn
    general, it seems like this was also once a more widespread practice based off
    of the Latin Alphabet; see page 186 of the following:\r\nhttp://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop021.pdf\r\n\r\nPossibly
    related, the U.S. Library of Congress classification scheme uses only J and not
    I. It does distinguish U and V however, so the reason for not including I might
    be simply to avoid confusion with 1."

  body: "In German the ambiguity of I and J remained longer than in other areas where
    the Latin script was used. In blackletter fonts I and J weren\u2019t differentiated
    at all until the 19th century. And in turn for Roman fonts, people often also
    didn\u2019t feel a need for clear differentiation. So they rather used a J-like
    design to represent an I \u2013 which could otherwise be mistaken for a lowercase
    l. (See riccard0\u2019s link)\r\nTschichold didn\u2019t like that at all. And
    regarding the I and J in blackletter he had a traditional view and hated the development
    of making a different design of blackletter I and J. So to him, the existence
    of a differentiation was directly connected to the type style. "
