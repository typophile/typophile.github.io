<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The Asian Art Museum in San Francisco is publishing a major catalogue of classic Thai art from the former kingdom of Ayutthaya, to be called The Kingdom of Siam. The desire is for the catalogue to reflect the style of earlier Western writings from around 1700 (in other words, around the time of the Romain du roi and early Franco-Dutch typography). A sample page of one of the models is provided. <br> <br>The typeface must also accommodate Thai diacritics, which have a couple of peculiarities, notably a backwards cedilla that has to combine with a macron, and a breve-like finishing stroke to some of the glyphs, which also must combine with a macron. I will upload funky approximations of these from a poor-quality source. <br> <br>I'm prepared to create the special characters if I have to, but I would prefer to find an existing typeface that meets the project needs. To further complicate things, all of my work is postscript but some people need to work with the diacritics on non-postscript Windows machines. Maybe open type is a way around this? <br> <br>Any suggestions much appreciated.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've never encountered a romanization scheme for Thai (although it makes sense there is one). Do you have a link to it? <br> <br>The sample setting you show is actually more Garamond than RdR, so if you want to match that, something as mundane as an Adobe font might do the trick for you. I would however recommend going the RdR route, if only to give the project a nice archaic look. <br> <br>What are some digital RdR-style fonts? <br>If you don't find a good one, can the project afford a commission for such a design? <br> <br>The diacritics: well, the reverse-cedilla thing could be approximated with an ogonek (the Polish mark), which is available in many fonts (although with greatly varying quality), especially these days. As for the "horn" (which reminds me nicely of the Thai ngao), maybe take the visually comparable mark from Vietnamese? This will be harder to find, especially in an appropriate font, so you might have to graft one on yourself. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thai has its own script (closely related to Lao & Burmese), which is not written with Latin characters. Modern Thai fonts are quite unrelated to this accented Latin stuff. <br> <br>The "backwards cedilla" is an ogonek, byt the way. The little thing sprouting off the u is a horn. Offhand, I don't know of any typefaces that would include these sorts of characters with the macrons as well, as precomposed characters. <br> <br>I could get into the technical stuff in more depth, but the short version is that if you want to use a font in more places than Word 2003 for Windows, you'll probably need specially encoded fonts (non-Unicode). I don't know that such fonts with the characters you want already exist, but I can't swear that they don't, either. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T <br> <br>Thomas Phinney <br>Program Manager <br>Fonts & Core Technologies <br>Adobe Systems</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for teaching me the word <i>ogonek.</i> I will be sure to use it soon! <br> <br>Of course Thai has its own script but it also has a romanization system, which uses the special marks I described among others. We mainly need these to render titles in the bibliography, where I guess they are critical. We are using the system approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library Association and published in a document imaginatively titled ALA-LC Romanization Tables. Following up on Hrant's suggestion I looked on-line for this and found it here: <a href=http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf target=_blank>http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf</a>. <br> <br>I agree about the sample. I considered Adobe Garamond and may still go with it, since we already own that font, but was afraid it wouldn't read as having the archaic quality that is being looked for. Also, this is only one of several model texts, and others are more RdR or Dutch in flavor than this one is. <br> <br>Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could afford to commission a special face! I doubt that would be within our budget, however (not having any real idea what it would cost). <br> <br>Thanks for your help.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Commissioning a whole new face (even one based on a metal source) is indeed expensive - at the very least $2000 (for one weight). So try to find an existing digital face that has the right flavor, and just commission somebody to add the Thai stuff - or do that yourself! <br> <br>BTW, it would be interesting to compare the LoC romanization to that of Lepsius (a scholar who once devised an entire <i>standardized system</i> of romanization usable for any script). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>BTW, since most fonts include a free-standing macron, all you might have to do for that accent is add some big fat negative kerning pairs to the font (once you find the right font :-). And you could just create a free-standing horn and do the same for that - that way you'll only take up one extra encoding slot, or even use unicode (which must have a horn somewhere). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Interesting, I have never seen any standard for Thai romanisation before.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>I have been peeking around typophile for a long while, basically since I started having an interest in typography (was it typography?) when I was looking/learing how to make my thesis, report, and slide presentation look more interesting. I got bored with Knuth's Computer modern, Times with MathTimes, and Lucida with LucidaNewMaths on a standard TeX system. There are not many choices there for mathematical oriented typography: Adobe just ditched a mac support for FrameMaker; hopefully, InDesign will have a built-in functionality to typeset mathematics and long documents to the level of previous FrameMaker. <br> <br>For the font -- I don't have any training in type design at all -- the first line looks nice; it probably is a bold/black weight of a text face. <br>The eyes of &amp;#3648;, &amp;#3604;, look optically imbalance, not sure why though. <br> <br>In the second line, I have seen this type of typeface used often in a magazine. Some letters are quite far from the way we write though: &amp;#3619; that looks like s; and &amp;#3600; that looks like &amp;#3592; with a horn. <br> <br>The main text looks pretty normal to me. IIRC, it looks similar to one that Microsoft includes in their OS. <br> <br>I notice some spacing problems here -- un-even spacing; I don't know how to solve it from the font perspective without hacking into the algorithm of the text setting software though. <br> <br>Regards, <br>Chanop</div>

<div class=commentbody>> I don't have any training in type design at all <br> <br>Like anything else, that can be both good and bad. Since there are many more designers than users on Typophile, and since the main point of typography is to accomodate the user, in this case I think that's definitely good! :-) <br> <br>> In the second line, I have seen this type of typeface used often in a magazine. <br> <br>What's interesting -and maybe shocking- in this case is that this was taken from a daily newspaper. <br> <br>> Some letters are quite far from the way we write <br> <br>But what about their "distance" from what people expect to <i>read</i>? <br>1) Are any of the letters highly difficult to decipher? <br>2) Upon a quick initial glance, is there a problem seeing that line as Thai and not English (Latin)? <br> <br>And a follow-up question: what do you think of the darker weight for emphasis in the body text?

<div class=commentbody>Oi vey. I was just on my way out to catch the first NHL play-off match. And here I am instead. <br> <br>AFAIK, the Thai romanization scheme is used extensively in foreign language instruction and the like - but not used at all 'in country'. By Thai that is. <br> <br>>What do you think about the fonts in this sample? <br> <br>[disclaimer: these comments are distilled through my Thai friends. I only wish they were wholly mine.] <br> <br>Line 1: standard newspaper headline that wants the reader to think it's more important than it is. Because of both the weight off the letters and the heads (loops). I.e. it's 'classical' Thai. Much like I make fun of faces like Trajan, my Thai friends make fun of things like this. <br> <br>Line 2: standard advertising, preferable to some readers than Line 2. Too romanized (e.g., 5th consonant, <i>ro rua</i>, is too much like an 's'.). A lot of Thai I know think the heads make reading harder and prefer faces as in Line 2. Even for running copy at small sizes. <br> <br>Lines 3-4: The Latin is too heavy. Arabic numerals are too heavy and too tall. I wouldn't be surpised if that was Browallia (an MS font as Chanop says). I'm no expert, but I think that the left sidebearing on <i>sara e</i> is too tight (7th 'base' glyph in the first word on the second line; 4th glyph in the last word). While it might look like the left bearings on <i>sara o</i> and <i>sar ai</i> are too big, that's what I usually see. And what usually seems to be accepted. <br> <br>Although, as I mentioned, all the head (loops) that make a face 'look Thai', they seem to hinder efficient reading. It's something I'm stuggling with as I'm working now. To be headed or not be headed. <br> <br>Sorry for the bad pun.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thom: I thought for a second that the romanization scheme for Thai might be similar to Vietnamese - and that you could use a Vietnamese font for this. But looking through my files, it doesn't appear to be. I'm sure you've already looked into this though. <br> <br>>But what about their "distance" from what people expect to read? <br> <br>I've got two handpainted signs from a friend's birthday party that I'll have to post scans of Hrant. They're in Thai - you'd love 'em. I can't make any sense of them whatsoever, but apparently Thai readers have no trouble at all. I imagine it's their version of Bickham Script or something. <br> <br>>And a follow-up question: what do you think of the darker weight for emphasis in the body text? I mean instead of italics. <br> <br>'Italics' only appeared in Thai printing in 1925. That's what the only source I've ever found says anyway. <br> <br>OK, off to hockey finally.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>For the font in line 2: <br>I have no problem reading it at all as it is on a head line. A quick glance, from my perpective, reveals that it definitely is Thai. I probably have some problem reading it in a long body text though as I feel that it is harder to read compare with the line 1. <br> <br>For the body text, a number of thai font designers seem to settle down that <i>bo-height</i> (<i>bo</i> is the 10th character on the bottom line) should be somewhere between x-height and caps-height. In many fonts, the harmony between Latin alphabets and Thai alphabets are not there; quite often, latin counterpart has a thicker stroke; sometimes a different design. <br> <br>The bold emphasis is a normal practice, I think. Usually there is no real italic (cursive) in same family but a slant form. To my knowledge, slant/italic shape in Thai came from a western influence. <br> <br>Personally, I like Thai face with the loop. It is easier to read. If you have not seen this, the following two links are a publication that the goverment published a while ago about Thai fonts. They are in Thai though. The interesting bits for you guys probably are those specimen at the end of the book and the free thai font "Norasi" which is Yannis Haralambous's design. The files are big (13.5Mb) and the difference between the two is Type 1 and TrueType font. <br> <br><a href=http://www.swpark.or.th/upload/download/ThaiNationalFont_PC.zip target=_blank>http://www.swpark.or.th/upload/download/ThaiNationalFont_PC.zip</a> <br><a href=http://www.swpark.or.th/upload/download/ThaiNationalFont_LINUX.zip target=_blank>http://www.swpark.or.th/upload/download/ThaiNationalFont_LINUX.zip</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>> it is harder to read compare with the line 1. <br> <br>Why? <br>Is it totally because the structures are unconventional, or partly because your mind is gravitating towards the Latin "cognates"? Would you say that an unconventional font that's <i>not</i> Latinized is less difficult to read (for a Thai who reads the Latin scipt)? <br> <br>> bo-height (bo is the 10th character on the bottom line) should <br>> be somewhere between x-height and caps-height. <br> <br>Makes perfect sense. This should apply to Cyrillic for example too, although I've found great resistance to the idea among designers of Cyrillic - which is particularly strange among their subset who also design Hebrew fonts, but for that script they <i>do</i> break the congruence! <br> <br>In my sample however this doesn't seem to be enough: "Home Depot" still looks too big. The balance seems to be more delicate than just "between x and cap". <br> <br>Slant/Italics: Why would you say Thai typographers avoid simple mechanical slanting? <br> <br>Thanks for the links - I will definitely check them out! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br> <br>It's harder to read in a long text because of familiarity, perhaps. Most texts that I have grown up used a typical Thai face with the circular head. However, there is no problem reading unconventional face on a poster. <br> <br>> Would you say that an unconventional font that's not Latinized is less difficult to read (for a Thai who reads the Latin scipt)? <br> <br>No, perhaps. <br> <br>>"Home Depot" still looks too big. The balance seems to be more delicate than just "between x and cap" <br> <br>Agree, totally. <br> <br>> Slant/Italics: Why would you say Thai typographers avoid simple mechanical slanting? <br> <br>I don't think they avoid mechanical slanting; slant fonts are being used everywhere, however, I think bold are often used more frequenly. <br> <br>Norasi came from an Omega-serif project -- a free face that looks like Times Roman. The aim of the project is to support typesetting in many scripts e.g. latin, greek, hindi, hebrew, and etc. <br> <br>Interestingly, Norasi used a scaled down Latin for its latin counterpart so that the whole font looks more in harmony. Nevertheless, the scaled down caps is ~71% while whe scaled down minuscule is ~77%. To my eyes, minuscule is still too big and too dark.</div>

Do you prehaps mean that the Thai font would look funny (too big on the body, I presume*) if it were made to match an existing Latin font outright? This would be an interesting paralles to my ArmenoLatin type system (Nour&Patria), where I discovered that the Armenian needed to be set about 10% larger to maintain apparent size (IF that's something you want in a given layout). Unfortunately, this makes some people (mostly die-hard Modernists) very uncomfortable - and many of them seem to have a mental block towards understanding why this <i>has</i> to be so. What's even harder is to explain to people why matching apparent size should not be a goal unto itself. <br> <br>* But relative to what? I guess the bulk of existing Thai fonts? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> Would you hazard a guess as to why? <br> <br>Towards a modern look, or a contrasty look, perhaps. <br> <br>> I don't understand. ... <br> <br>"Too big on the body" I don't quite understand the term, but I think it is. Let's say we have a typical Latin face at 1000 emsq design size (Type 1); Caps hight is ~700, x-height ~450, and the length from the highest point to the lowest point (ascender-descender) is within 1000. To match this face with Thai alphabet that has a regular height between Caps and x height, let's assume it to be 550-600. That is fine until we look at some characters like <i>sara o, sara i, sara u, tonal marks,</i> and etc. When we combine the total design size from the top to the bottom, it goes well beyond 1000, quite ofen 1300-1500. <br> <br>Is there any real specification for this issue? Thomas? I have looked into Adobe Type 1 spec book, but found no concrete answer. <br> <br>TrueType Font distributed with Microsoft OS tend to reduce the size of Latin alphabet; the exception probably is Tahoma which is designed for screen reading. Designer of Tahoma squished the upper/lower vowels, tonal marks a little. So everything would fit in the point size. <br> <br>What I meant about Nosari is that, since the minuscule was scaled down less than the caps, so it looks too big. Besides, the stroke weight of Thai alphabets does not quite match the weight of the Latin ones, especially the bold weight. <br> <br>Let's see how I can post the image.... (still reinstalling panther, just got my pbook back from a service).</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, so Thai has a "problem" with its distribution of vertical information: most of the letters are bo-height, so you have to make that big enough, but many of the letters use up much more vertical space. Sort of like accents in Latin caps (which are normally made to go beyondthe EM bounds), but I guess the super-tall letters in Thai are pretty common? <br> <br>A request: could you possibly find me some linguistic data about Thai? Specifically, I'd love to have a chart showing the relative frequency of each letter in Thai. If you could, that would be very nice! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

I've been under the impression that Vietnamese had it's own ideographic writing system up until colonization and, consequently, romanization. <br> <br>>Nathan, I'd love to see those scans! But pre-emptively: there's a difference between taking many seconds to read a strange display face versus reading a book. <br> <br>True enough. I'm still amazed at how divergent the letterforms can be. <br> <br>>could you possibly find me some linguistic data about Thai? <br> <br>Hrant, you might look up Doug Cooper at CRCL in Thailand. Also, the University of Wiscosin at Madison has a pretty good Southeast Asian studies department. I don't know anyone there, but they might be helpful. <br> <br>>[italics] As a separate style, or subordinate to the "Roman"? <br> <br>Off the top off my head, I'd say a separate style. I.e., not subordinated to 'roman' in running copy. <br> <br>>What is the title and what are the publication details of the book they are taken from? Do you actually have the book? <br> <br>Unfortunately, I just have the one leaf. I've been half-heartedly trying to find some details about it, but so far without success. If I run into anything, I'll definitely let you know. <br> <br>It might be interesting to you that the first book printed with the Thai script was in 1828. About 60 years after the end of the Ayutthaya period. Before that every book used the romanization scheme you've got. Although these days when Thai is transliterated, it typically doesn't use the macrons, horns, and such. That said, I think it'd be pretty hard to do 'period-correct' typography without building a new face with the requisite accented characters. <br> <br>>TrueType Font distributed with Microsoft OS <br> <br>You know, the Thai fonts distributed with Windows have actually gone through one huge change. Originally, Angsana (Times New Roman) was Angsana UPC. These fonts were made by Unity Progress, a Thai company, and I believe optimized for Thai - at 14 points the Latin was way to small. So now Angsana is Angsana New. As are all the Thai fonts in the OS. Although, perhaps the UPC versions are still used in Thailand.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great thread. Sorry I found it so late. Chanop asked: <br> <br><i>Is trere any other Thai romanisation standard around?</i> <br> <br>There is also an ISO standard for Thai romanisation, ISO/FDIS 11940, but I have not examined it because ISO want me to pay 79 Swiss francs for the privilege. <br> <br>Regarding combining Latin and Thai in a single font, it is necessary to reduce the size of the Latin considerably if you want to balance it to the Thai and still allow adequate vertical space for the latter in the body height. Quite apart from the tall Thai glyphs, including three frequently occuring tall vowels, there are vowel and tone mark stacks to be accounted for, although the taller of these can reasonably extend beyond the body height. When working on a new Thai design, Fiona Ross, Tim Holloway and I examined a number of bilingual publications to get a sense of the conventional relative height and weight proportions of Latin and Thai when used together, and to see what works best. Sorry I can't show the result yet; suffice to say that I can confirm Chanop's observation that 'bo-height ... should be somewhere between x-height and caps-height'. <br> <br>I had no idea Nathan was into Thai type. Cool.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> What about Nom script? <br> <br>Yeah, Nom is not Roman, it's Chinese-based.

<div class=commentbody>Wow, this is great! Thank you. And looking at the raw data, the corpus looks to be plenty huge. <br> <br>A couple of questions: <br>1) What's that complex character at DC? <br>2) For the floating accents (like in the range D4-DA and elsewhere), how does one predict how much above/below the main letter they will end up being placed? What base letters do they add on to? And can they double/triple up? What I'm trying to figure out is how much height/depth they can add to the vertical span of a Thai line (both typically and in extreme cases). <br> <br>Again: thank you! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, looking a little bit closer, I can see that accents can double-up. Questions: <br>1) Which accents can double-up? <br>2) Can they <i>triple</i> up? <br>3) When accents double-up, are there rules of relative placement? <br>4) Would it be offensive to shorten the base character when an accent (or two) is added? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>1. In Thai, letter can have a combination of a vowel mark and a tone mark. <br>2. Not for Thai, but I'm not sure if there might also be other, minority languages that use the script, and which might have different orthographic norms. <br>3. The placement of both is determined relative to the right-side vertical of the letter. However, in practical terms e.g. in OpenType GPOS positioning, the upper mark in a stack is positioned relative to the lower mark (&lt;mkmk> feature), which in turn is positioned relative to the letter (&lt;mark> feature). <br>4. Yes.</div>

It's quite important, at least for the moment, in technical implementation for line breaking and justification. Because a sentence in Thai is written without any space, therefore to break a like at an appropriate place, without breaking a word, is difficult -- it still is an active research area.

<div class=commentbody>>So loose spacing is a cultural convention but traditional letter structures is not? <br> <br>I am an advocate of tight letterspacing (for but most typefaces, as long as the word space is also tight,) but since when is it "traditional" for letters to actually crash, as some of the characters in these samples seem to do? <br> <br>Moreover, as far as "tradition" goes, it is arrogant to apply Western traditions to non-Western languages.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I see better now what you are getting at. I'll see what I can find out (if anything). <br> <br>Just as a conjecture: could cultural restrictions against inappropriate touching, which can sometimes be rather elaborate, influence the perception of type? <br> <br>Along these lines, it might be interesting to see if there is elsewhere any correspondence between cultural attitudes to personal space and attitudes to spacing of type. <br> <br>My guess is that any such analysis would be difficult or impossible because of the number of factors that come into play, and I can't say that any obvious correlation in Western type jumps out at me. <br> <br>For example, on average northern Europeans might demonstrate a greater ideal personal space than southern Europeans, but economic demands might nonetheless mandate tighter spacing. <br> <br>Still, you would expect ideas about space to affect many kinds of cultural expression (architecture, for example) and consequently to affect typography as well. Somehow I am having trouble seeing this very clearly, however. <br> <br>I suppose analphabetic languages would have a different set of rules. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>how much they would mind a modified scheme <br> <br>Well, they minded quite a bit reading the sample I gave them with vowels & such shifted about. So much so that I can't see any use for it in text settings. Not the particular approach I used, anyhow. <br> <br>>if clearly shown the advantages of economy <br> <br>But I think that you can only economize so much. E.g., we could modify Latin letters quite a bit (even more than we have) to make them more 'efficient', but I can't see people going for it.

All I have are conversations with Thai readers to form my opinions. I don't have any real (empirical) data to back any of this up. That comes in a few years hopefully.</div>

This both saves vertical space and ensures that the whole combination does not become top heavy. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/33069.gif alt="Sukothai stacking tone marks"> <br>Even when using something like the OpenType GPOS &lt;mkmk> feature to build stacks, rather than having multiple non-spacing characters at different heights, a well made font will include these small tone mark variants that will be contextually substituted when preceded by a vowel mark. <br> <br> <br>Hrant: <i>Is it offensive to move the second (higher) mark to the left of the first one, to save vertical space?</i> <br> <br>Questioning whether such a thing is offensive only addresses its acceptability to native readers, whose acceptance or rejection <i>may</i> be conventional. More interesting is to ask whether such an innovation is actually useful, and whether it makes sense within the structure of the writing system. <br> <br>The answer to the question 'Is it actually useful?' has to be no. Apart from a small number of what may be termed double-width letters, e.g. <i>tho phuthao</i> and <i>no nen</i>, the Thai letters are not wide enough for diagonal left+down shifting of a stacked tone mark to reduce the total height: there simply isn't enough space in which to lower the mark. If you look at the first two pairs of letters in the example above, which are typical of the majority of Thai letters, it is clear that the vowel mark occupies most of the width of the letter. Even if one were to shift and lower the stacked tone mark on the wider letters, the total height required for stacked marks is necessarily determined by the narrowest base letter. <br> <br>I also think your suggestion does not make sense within the organisational structure of the Thai writing system. If you look through the Font Book PDF that Chanop provided, you'll see that a lot of consideration is given to correct horizontal alignment of marks to letters (see pages 61-79). There is very clearly a correct way to position marks, which is relative to the right-side vertical stroke of the base letter. <br> <br>The most common element in Thai text is a vertically organised grapheme consisting of a letter, a letter + vowel, a letter + tone, or letter + vowel + tone (some letters may also take modifier subscript marks). Because the 'sub-atomic' elements of the grapheme are arranged vertically, the verticality of the grapheme becomes an important structural concern. The verticality of the grapheme is established by the right-side vertical stroke of the letters, which is a feature common to all Thai letters: there are some letters that have no left-side vertical, e.g. <i>ngo ngu</i> and <i>wo waen</i>, but there are no letters that do not have a definite vertical stroke on the right side, even if some of these strokes do not ascend to the 'bo-height', e.g. <i>ro rua</i>, and in some letters elements, such as loops or flourishes, may extend horizontally beyond the right-side vertical, e.g. the loop in <i>no nen</i> in some styles and the tail of the ring in <i>so rusi.</i> <br> <br>In order to maintain the verticality of the grapheme, marks above and below the base letter are aligned relative to the right-side vertical stroke. The only time they are shifted to the left is for the tall letters, e.g. <i>fo fa</i>, in which the right-side vertical itself rises above the bo-height. It is worth noting that when a tall vowel such as <i>sara o</i> follows a letter with a mark or mark stack above, it is the tall vowel that is letter-spaced (positive kerned) to avoid a collision with the mark(s): the marks are not shifted to the left to avoid the collision, because this would disrupt the verticality of the grapheme. <br> <br>One might ask, why is the verticality of graphemes important? Why is it a strictly maintained aspect of the Thai script? I suspect it is a response to the Thai orthography and, in particular, to the length of visually unbroken strings of words making up phrases. Apart from light kerning to reduce white space caused by some combinations of letters, e.g. <i>no nen</i> followed by &lt;/i>cho chan&lt;/i> in styles where the lower right loop on the first letter extends beyond the right-side vertical, well-typeset Thai text consists of discreet, vertically arranged graphemic units that do not interact horizontally with their neighbours. This makes a lot of sense in terms of clarity when one looks at the long strings of such graphemes between phrase breaks. The verticality of the graphemes is an aid to breaking these long phrases into words, by preventing horizontal interaction across what may be word boundaries. <br> <br><i>...about the DC character: why is it missing from the Unicode Thai encoding?</i> <br> <br>The zero-width space is not specific to Thai, so Unicode encodes only one, U+200B, which is used by various scripts and mapped to the appropriate decimal codepoint in 8-bit codepages.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Questioning whether such a thing is offensive <br>> only addresses its acceptability to native <br>> readers, whose acceptance or rejection <br>> <i>may</i> be conventional. <br> <br>Sure, and you allude to an interesting difference between the sensibilities of natives versus learners: the former are more demanding in terms of cultural authenticity (because they can feel that and they value it; and they can figure out "warped" glyphs), while the latter are more demanding in terms of explicit legibility (because they need that just for basic reading; and they're not good at discerning authenticity). <br> <br>To make a font that's versatile but progressive, you would need to make sure learners can figure out what the new (or really "variant") letterform is, but maintain the necessary cultural sensitivity. If Thai people really don't have much of a problem with hyper-Latinized fonts, I think they might be able to handle some shifting accents too. <br> <br>But to some extent you have to choose your target. And as with any culturally progressive effort, it makes more sense to target the natives and not the learners - for the latter one should just use the "normal" fonts. <br> <br>Also, different scripts have different proportions of people learning (and <i>needing</i> to learn) versus natives simply reading. For a script like Thai (and unlike English) which might need to provide for its natives more than learners, a progressive approach makes more sense (as long as there's no strong threat of assimilation) than it would elsewhere. <br> <br>> More interesting is to ask whether such an <br>> innovation is actually useful, and whether <br>> it makes sense within the structure of the <br>> writing system. <br> <br>Well, of course that has to be established first - otherwise it's just change for its own sake, which I tend to see as a sort of hooliganism. The advantage of taming the vertical span of Thai is obvious: it allows for a better balance of apparent size and economy. Your issue of Thai letters "not being wide enough" I think is not only secondary, but possibly even a reason to explore improved readability through the introduction of greater width (especially <i>variability</i> of width) into the script! Or maybe you could vary the sizes of the accents (which you're doing anyway) - this size variation might even introduce more room to improve readability (in the way Hangul does). <br> <br>There are many avenues to improving any script - you have to think from outside in, because that's where true functionality (as opposed to merely following potentially half-baked rules) comes from. <br> <br>There's also another -probably more practical- advantage to taming the height: the need to reduce matching Latin (and other) fonts in size would be made less important. <br> <br>Basically the way in which Thai is using the Cartesian space is somewhat inefficient: the extreme vertical spikes in a body that's mostly of uniform height throws a wrench in leading, hence economy. Imagine writing English where just the "h" goes up to double its height. <br> <br>> There is very clearly a correct way to position marks <br> <br>But the ever-present question in writing reform is exactly this: what is "correct", to whom? Is what's correct to a writing scholar correct to the layman reader? Not as a rule, no. Some people think there's only a certain way a Latin "r" can be correct, but when you corner them they have no real defense of their position. And you know what I think about them... :-) <br> <br>People -especially as they get older- tend to like to apply what they know, instead of keeping an open mind. This is especially true in a craft, where there's constant pressure to simply and quickly produce more instances of something that works OK. But to some people "OK" is cultural death. <br> <br>> Thai text consists of discreet, vertically arranged graphemic units that do not interact horizontally with their neighbours <br> <br>Ah, but maybe this is bad? Sure, it makes individual "graphemes" easier to decipher, but like Latin text that's too loosely spaced, maybe it reduces readability? Always keep in mind the difference between deliberative and immersive reading. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, just to clarify: when I talk about Thai type I am expressing things that I have learned and ideas that I have developed in the process of working on Thai type design with experienced colleagues. I don't claim any great expertise in Thai, but my thoughts are grounded in the practical experience of making a typeface that has been described as 'extremely readable' by a fluent reader and expert in the Thai script. I mention this because, in your enthusiasm, you sometimes seems to assume that other people are beginning from the same level of ignorance or knowledge as you, and proceeding on the same theoretical and imaginatice basis. I think this can be a problem in our discussions, because I'm almost always commenting only from direct experience. <br> <br>Also, your comments regarding the different sensibilities of natives versus learners are not at all in line with my experience in working with a number of scripts. Very often, I find I am much more concerned about the cultural authenticity of a design than native readers are, many of whom have grown up in a period of debasement of their national typography due to technical limitations, influence of outside fashions, or cultural uncertainty, and who may accept as normal things that are actually alien to or at best uncharacteristic of the longer traditions of their script. Unless they are themselves type designers, and working outside of contemporary fashions in graphic design, native readers are unlikely to do much research into such traditions, and so remain ignorant of what might be termed deep authenticity. I am not speaking here specifically about Thai; indeed, apart from some deplorable, latinising fashions in display type, Thai typography is in relatively good shape. But your generalisation regarding learners being unable to discern cultural authenticity does not seem to me to hold true. Cultural authenticity is something that can be apprehended from knowledge of a writing system and its development; natives and learners alike need to learn this, and can. This is not to deny that there are very insensitive non-native type designers making a hash of various scripts (there are also native designers doing the same thing), but they're just not doing a good job; they are, in fact, neither natives nor learners: they are not bothering to learn.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, of course I don't assume everybody knows as little as I do about Thai! But I do believe that different approaches and requirements allow for different types of "solutions". You generally make highly-usable fonts that "distill" conventional ideas into a highly polished -and not unoriginal- whole. That's very useful, no doubt about it. But then there's a parallel need to always doubt existing practice, to revert to the true nature of functionality and try to rebuild/redirect a script. Of course tradition is part of that functionality, but the lines you cross will depend very much on your <i>intentions</i>. For example, I think this is why you advocate breaking the Latin x-height bounds for Hebrew (which has varied conventions in that respect), but not for Cyrillic (because virtually no other type designers do it). Following the expectations of other type designers (and really not much anybody else, as far as I'm concerned) helps ensure greater adoption of your designs. If you made a Cyrillic font with an "x-height" greater than the one in the/a corresponding Latin font (clearly a much better solution for the Cyrillic <i>user</i>), the General would not be pleased, and the Bee would give you no honey! :-) But I do hope that soon will find yourself in a position to innovate more. Admittedly (assuming one has the patience) first establishing a reputation for solid conventional design might help more people eventually accept one's innovations, but many designers do seem to get stuck in a rut, never leaving the comfy (and materially more rewarding) practice of simply giving people what they're used to. I really really wish Slimbach for example would start leveraging his commanding position to <i>push</i> at least just a little bit, already. <br> <br>As for your point about the types of sensibilities of different groups, I think you have to note how exceptional you are! Certainly, proportionally more non-native than native type designers have insufficient respect for a given script. I remember asking a few attendees of the Greek conference in 2002 what they thought of the current state of Greek type, and virtually all them disliked it as being inauthentic. Also, when you say that the average layman doesn't do any "research", you're right, but he doesn't need to! The point is that his sensibilities are built implicitly over time; he doesn't need to know <i>why</i> that second line in my sample is problematic to simply <i>feel</i> that it is. This is the difference between pleasing other designers versus the -more important- users. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>For example, I think this is why you advocate breaking the Latin x-height bounds for Hebrew (which has varied conventions in that respect), but not for Cyrillic (because virtually no other type designers do it).</i> <br> <br>You are mischaracterising my reasons for harmonising features of the Cyrillic and Latin scripts. I have explained, at length, that within the specific sub-genres of post-Petrine text types in which I have worked to date, the Latin and Cyrillic scripts are historical and natural cognates. You can reject that style if you want, but the harmonisation with Latin is a feature of that style and has been for 250 years. If I were designing Cyrillic type in a different style, e.g. one of the Old Church Slavonic styles, I would not feel any need to harmonise x-height or any other feature to Latin, even if the font were to contain both scripts. Similarly, I can imagine new Cyrillic styles that would not naturally harmonise with Latin, but I'd rather leave these developments to the Slavs: I am in every sense a 'learner', and don't think it is my position to teach <i>except</i> when my work uncovers authentic but neglected traditions that contemporary practitioners are ignorant of. One might put it this way: you seemingly never met a writing system that you didn't think you couldn't improve; I never met a writing system that I didn't think could improve me. <br> <br>By the way, when designing Hebrew type my choice about whether to align the head to the Latin x-height depends on the intended use of the font. I do prefer to make the Hebrew taller, and am happy that this convention is most common in Biblical scholarship, but when designing bi-scriptal fonts for modern office use in Israel I will align the heights, because this has become the prevailing convention in that setting. <br> <br>Regarding Greek, I think you should ask non-Greek type designers who work with Greek what they think of the current state of Greek type design. I think you will find that most of them are very much aware of the issue of authenticity, and tend to be much more concerned about it than the average Greek graphic designer or typographer, who are the people responsible for the use of inauthentic, latinised types. I recall that your visit to the conference was fleeting, and that you missed much of the most interesting stuff. Were you there for the raucous open forum at the end, when Jean-Fran</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the Latin and Cyrillic scripts are historical and natural cognates. <br> <br>I still don't get: <br>1) Why structural cognates can't simply be of different sizes. <br>2) How you can believe that a <i>user</i> benefits from such formalisms, which certainly comes at the expense of <i>true</i> visual harmony: mere geometric congruence between two scripts typically leads to discord in fact.

Natives have some (probably most) of the advantage, but non-native can indeed be of benefit in providing a external, more objective view. When you're too close to something, you can't see it very clearly. <br> <br>> you seemingly never met a writing system that you didn't think you couldn't <br>> improve; I never met a writing system that I didn't think could improve me. <br> <br>You have also described me with your second sentence - certainly the two are not exclusive. Furthermore there are two aspects to what I'm saying, and you shouldn't bundle them: one is indeed script reform (like moving Thai accents around), while the other is clearly within the context of type design (like making the Cyrillic "x-height" bigger than the Latin). <br> <br>Regarding Greek: yes, you have a point. But overall it's pretty obvious that non-natives generally care less than natives. This is common sense. <br> <br>Thomas, you probably weren't asking me, but: I find that the Paratype Cyrillics are the same as most any other Cyrillics: way too harmonized on the superficial level, but as a result discordant on the true functional level - the bane of Modernism in fact. Anybody with an understanding of the difference between display and text type (as well as an ability to be objective) can see this clearly. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>[More on Cyrillic, I'm afraid, that should be part of another, more general thread on type design across multiple scripts.

In the case of Cyrillic and Latin, these are have developed side-by-side since the 18th Century: this is the post-Petrine norm. There is a Latin letter a and a Cyrillic letter a: and in the post=Petrine styles they are the same form, weight and size. The fact is that, for better or for worse, the Petrine Civil Type was specifically designed to harmonise Cyrillic and Latin in this way: i.e. to make the same use of Cartesian space. This is the point at which I enter Cyrillic type design, with 250 years of dominance of this particular style, and with customers who want to pay me to develop useable, readable typefaces that conform to accepted norms for the script. Within this framework, I will make recommendations against prevailing norms <i>if</i> they are demonstrably contrary to the authentic development of the script within that culture. Quite apart from the longevity of the post-Petrine style, though, one has to see that 18th Century innovation in the context of a changing but still specifically Russian culture and its involvement with a larger European culture.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the Petrine Civil Type was specifically designed to harmonise Cyrillic <br>> and Latin in this way: i.e. to make the same use of Cartesian space. <br> <br>Even if I agree with your benchmark for "cognation"*, there's a problem with this particular statement: when I say "usage of the Cartesian space", I mean to include not just the shape and extend of structural elements, but also the frequency of usage of the different sections of the space. This is important because the visual information conveyed by text (and expected by the reader) is totally dependent on how often ascenders and descenders pop up for example - and of course Latin and Cyrillic are very different in this respect**. This is in fact why the problem with a congruent x-height comes up: because Cyrillic uses the ascender and descender space far less, it ends up having a smaller apparent size (same as in Thai, like Chanop pointed out). And in the case of a book in both languages for example, this will cause the Russian setting to look "less important" - which is clearly more of a problem than lack of geometric congruence at the mico level (something only designers notice anyway). <br> <br>* Although even in the formal realm (not to mention the practical, "user" realm) it does seem problematic. For example, what script pair besides Latin/Cyrillic has cognates?! <br> <br>** Heck, even Latinate languages -like English and Polish- are very different in this respect! <br> <br>-- <br> <br>Chanop, thanks so much for the translation! I'll be looking at it closely tomorrow. <br> <br>The book: If anybody can find a brick-and-mortar source for it, I could try asking my brother to buy a copy or two. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Not to sidetrack the discussion of Thai typefaces, but this is roughly the direction I think I am going with this book as a design project. Although the sample I showed was Garamond or something like it, there are also examples of early English printing that are in the general spirit we want to evoke, and I am tending more in that direction. This is black and white but the actual page will use color: the word SIAM maybe in a burgundy red and the fleurons in a very faint blue perhaps ... or possibly the whole thing will continue to evolve. ("SIAM" is a little faint here because it was in color.) I've never used fleurons like this before, and they're a bit in your face; my plan is to tint them back to where they're barely visible. Not sure the best treatment for the rules. I haven't fine-tuned the spacing of the type yet. <br>The page size is 8.75 in. x 12 in.

<div class=commentbody>Tom: I dig the border. Not often that you see that sort of thing. Off the top of my head, I wonder what it would look like if SIAM was in italic caps, tracked pretty loose. <br> <br>>how are the "native" Thai numerals used? <br> <br>Hrant, this isn't typographic, but I've been told that in school, Thais used to do arithmetic with Arabic numerals, but write the final sums with Thai. Not sure if it's still like that or not though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One thing to note about the Thai numerals is that their considerable variance in widths makes them unsuitable for tabular settings. <br> <br>When designing a biscript font for Thai and Latin (using an existing Latin design but scaled and weight adjusted to harmonise with the Thai), I redrew the European figures* so that they were bo-height and blend better in Thai text. <br> <br> <br>* I don't like the term 'Arabic figures' because what this really refers to is the Arabic counting system adopted by the Europeans, not the eveolved forms of the European numerals, which are very different from their Arabic counterparts. The Arabs, meanwhile, call their numerals 'Indic figures', acknowledging the origin of their counting system, even though the Arab numerals bear little resemblance to any of the many forms of Indic numerals.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>(I understand that the numerals are akin to those used in the Cambodian script.)</i> <br> <br>This is also my understanding. David Smyth writes, in <i>Thai: an essential grammar,</i> 'Thai script numerals are identical to those found in the Cambodian script, while the Lao script employs some but not all of the same number symbols.' <br> <br>The Cambodian numerals were apparently adopted 'as is' from the Khmer (Cambodian) script. What I find interesting is that the Khmer numerals 7 and 8 are clearly the basis for the Thai tone mark <i>mai tri</i> and the vowel <i>mai taikhu</i>. I'd be interested to know why these forms were chosen for these marks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> unsuitable for tabular settings. <br> <br>Really? Yes, they seem to require some gentle distortion to make fixed-width, but on the flip side there's no member that's totally hopeless: think of the Arabic* one. The worst of the Thai numerals (in terms of making fixed-width) seem to be on the order of the Arabic "4" and "7". <br> <br>* I'd have to think about the issue of there being enough of a problem with "Arabic" to justify a break with convention. BTW, the European Arabic numerals look different than the contemporary Arab numerals because the Arabs stopped using the ones they passed along to Europe in favor of a set from India. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>No, because mostly you're worried about collisions with sara_u and sara_uu (the bottom accents - phinthu is too rare to worry about). If either the top or the bottom accents were very rare, there would be less of a problem - because you can never <i>totally</i> avoid collisions (unless economy is a non-issue). Think of the accented caps in Latin. <br> <br>But I guess it's a matter of thresholds, and an accent would have to be <i>very</i> rare to be safely ignorable. Looking at the frequencies, mai_han-akat/mai_tho isn't rare enough either, so fooling only with the sara_ii/sara_uee might be pointless. On the other hand, mai_han-akat might be able to "cradle" a higher accent in a way that sara_ii/sara_uee can't. So you still gain a bit just by addressing those. If you work your way down and start fooling with the worst cases first, and eventually stop at a good threshold, you can gain some room. But it has to appear consistent too, although never really 100%. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Alignment is a form of Regularity, and Regularity is a cornerstone of Modernism (you could even say of Western thought). I certainly understand that there's an issue with apparent size versus vertical span limits (which is why some people scale down the Latin part of a Thai/Latin system), but making the Thai bo-height match the Latin x-height sacrifices functionality for no good reason. On the other hand maybe you're saying that <i>system</i> (or "UI") fonts have to be set flush (no leading), so I guess it's a special problem. My questions would be: is Lucida Grande really a UI font? Do non-UI Latin/Thai system usually not suffer from this? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>PUA = bad. <br> <br>Yeah, that's what I keep hearing. Obviously this isn't the thread for discussing it - perhaps I'll start a different one.

<div class=commentbody>The current MS Thai engine (Office 2003), handles this glyph substitution in two ways, either by doing a buffered character substitution to the PUA codepoint or by applying OpenType Layout features. The latter is preferable; also one can use OpenType for additional substitutions, not handled on a character-to-PUA basis by the basic engine (e.g. ligation of <i>po pla</i> and <i>mai han-akat</i> and substitution of small stacking forms for tone marks). <br> <br>The kind of buffered character substitution used in the older approach is the most benign kind of PUA use -- certainly much better than actually using PUA characters in the text stream --, but it is still reliant on wholly private agreement about which PUA codepoints to use. There is nothing to stop another software vendor from specifiying a different PUA for the same Thai variant glyphs, in which case your fonts only reliably work in specific, narrow environments.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, do the OpenType Layout features work equally well in Macintosh environments? Also, the documentation on Microsoft's Thai shaping specifies the mark & mkmk features&#0151;and says that they're required. Are these GPOS lookups absolutely necessary for the shaping to work? Or is it possible to do everything with GSUB? <br> <br>E.g., can you substitute <i>mai ek</i> (0E48) with its variant at F70A when it follows a consonant&#0151;rather than <i>positioning</i> it lower?

<div class=commentbody>Sadly, no, unless the Mac app completely rolls its own support for the mark and mkmk features. Apple does not yet support any OpenType layout features other than GPOS 'kern' and even that is rather spottily done. <br> <br>One can do a lot of this via GSUB, although it may be less efficient in some cases (particularly for TrueType fonts, it will bloat the font file size a lot). Assuming the app does things in a sane fashion, GSUB won't destroy the underlying text stream because the app stores the *base* Unicode prior to text processing. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>You could use GSUB for everything, but GPOS is much more efficient and provides finer control in a greater number of situations. <br> <br>There are essentially two ways to do Thai solely with GSUB: <br> <br>1. Make a precomposed glyph for every possible combination of base + mark(s) and use the &lt;ccmp> feature to access these as ligatures. <br> <br>2. Create a variety of combining mark variants at various heights and different horizontal offsets, and contextually substitute these using the &lt;calt> feature. <br> <br>The second method is certainly practical, but you don't escape from GPOS completely -- I'm guessing that your question might stem from a desire to do all your work in FontLab, which doesn't support much in the way of GPOS --, because Thai requires contextual kerning for tall vowels following stacks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Speaking of Thai kerning, note also that for some kerning you want to ignore combining marks, i.e. kerning between base letters when the presence of combining marks above or below has no impact on the desired base-to-base spacing, but at other times you want to kern off the combining marks, e.g. when <i>sara o</i> follows a combination of bo-height base with one or two marks above. So you need to appropriately set the LookupFlag bits in individual lookups.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've actually done some work with VOLT, but I've found that support for GPOS lookups among different apps is a bit spotty. That drove my initial thought to use GSUB instead. I thought it might enjoy more universal support. Though I could be wrong about that. I haven't done anything with it in a while, but I was following your second option: using &lt;calt>. It seems like that's essentially what the MS shaping engine does with the PUA points. <br> <br>>when sara o follows a combination <br> <br>John, I'm assuming from this that you kern <i>sara o</i> with preceding bo-height consonants? And that when above marks are present, <i>sara o</i> needs to shift right to avoid a collision with the vowel and/or tone. Personally, I've never seen <i>sara o</i>, <i>sara ai maimuan</i>, or <i>sara ai maimalai</i> kerned with preceding consonants. I've always assumed (perhaps wrongly) that it was because those three vowels attached to the following consonants. Although it's probably dumb on my part (or overly wishful) to think that phonology/morphology would affect typical kerning conventions.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Resurrecting this ancient thread...
I'm trying to get to grips with the <code>IgnoreMarks</code> declaration in relation to contextual kerning in Thai. I have kerned the sara ii and sara o. I am wondering whether I can avoid the need to explicitly list contextual kerning triplets by putting in an <code>IgnoreMarks</code> statement to ignore any additional marks above the sara ii. Or would <code>IgnoreMarks</code> mess up the kerning between the sara ii and the sara o?

<div class=commentbody>Thanks John, I was hoping you'd reply. I'm glad the straightforward approach will work.

The marks to ignore, alternate versions of tone marks that are smaller and higher:
<code>@tone2 = [t.maiek.alt t.maitho.alt t.maitri.alt t.maichattawa.alt ... ];</code>
Then in the kerning feature:
<code>lookup kern1 {
<code> script thai;
<code> lookupflag IgnoreMarks @tone2;
<code> pos t.voweli t.vowelo 80;

<div class=commentbody>I'm afraid I can't offer much help with AFDKO syntax: I do all my OTL work in VOLT. But if AFKDO follows the font table structure in this regard, the process marks flag would be inclusive, rather than exclusive, i.e. you define a group of marks that you want to be processed, not to be ignored. So, for example, I define a group of 'above_marks_main', which includes only the full-size vowel and tone marks that apply directly to the base letter, and not the small variant tone marks that would sit above the main marks.
I apply the kerning between tall vowels and preceding marks as a DX and Width adjustment to the second glyph, i.e. to the tall vowel, rather than as a width adjustment to the mark glyph. Windows likes glyphs classified as marks to be zero-width, and while it is possible to use a separate GPOS lookup to give width to individual mark glyphs, in pair positioning adjustments they should remain zero-width. This is how it looks in VOLT:
