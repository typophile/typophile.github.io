  body: Thanks guys. Now, I&#39;ve got to go to bed. Nice to know I have friends on
    European time. =&#41; <BR> <BR>Yves, it&#39;s fitting that you set that in the
    first typeface I ever fell in love with. &#40;Or was it Meta or Template Gothic,
    it&#39;s all an FF Blur now.&#41;

  body: Corporate typeface... I&#39;m trying to figure out which you&#39;re talking  <BR>about,
    Tiff. If you&#39;re going to embarrass me, it&#39;s okay. I know I  <BR>went through
    a phase there where I tried to use Clicker on  <BR>everything, but it never worked
    for anything and I finally gave  <BR>up. &#40;Hey, I was a student, cut me some
    slack!&#41;

  body: I&#39;m not trying to embarrass you, not at all. I was actually smiling and
    reminiscing when I typed that. Just think of the current foundry that we don&#39;t
    recommend people license from and then try and find a sans that reminds you of
    working with me. :^&#41;

    <BR>and I have to say I find lovely this kind of threads. <BR>Back on 1997 I spent
    some time in London, a Jamaican <BR>guy called Andrew Pemberton lodged me; now
    I lost the <BR>contact with him, but here, well, just a short story <BR>that came
    to my mind because of your name. <BR> <BR>AS
