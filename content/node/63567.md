  the lastest version.<em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tweaking_5692.jpg]\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\nNevertheless
  this post presents a different approach. After 2 months of designing the Simplease
  logotype I started to become a little worried about this \"beating a dead horse
  thing\". Next thing on my mind was let's go back to the drawing board -- mentally
  as well as physically.\r\n<em></em>\r\nActually I wanted to communicate simplicity
  -- the current approach kind of communicates usualness. Allthough I was never doubting
  the connection between both of them, at some moment I started to believe that there
  must be a more distinctive way of telling the story. The first thing that came to
  my mind was a more \"constructed\" type. Maybe one that's based on a grid-system.
  That was about the time when I started to sketch.\r\n<em></em>\r\nIt took some time
  to realize that a very strict grid-system would just be a little too ... hmmm ...
  strict. To get an impression of existing typefaces that might convey the message
  I initiated a \"widespread\" search and after a 30 minute long search-odyssee I
  found Neo Sans. It turns out to be perfect. Everything I had to do was kerning.
  It's everything I was dreaming of. The grid-shaped letters have such pleasant roundings
  -- it's both, simple and pleasant.\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplease_leo_5001.jpg]\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\nI
  especially like the subtle connections between the letters of 'ease'. Finally the
  awkward negative space of the self-made version is gone. Maybe I'll put my hands
  on the 's' and the upper part of the 'a' ... just trying, because I think it's already
  great.\r\n\r\n<em></em><em></em>\r\n<cite>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/61385\">Simplease

  body: "I remember seeing your older thread, Simplicious, and I'm curious... how
    come you are going with a lowercase S? Seemed like before I was able to read it
    as a nice combination of \"Simple ease\" much better. Now I can't help but read
    \"sim please.\" Perhaps it's the dot-less i... to me, without it, there's more
    weight on the right side of the word (my eye interprets the descender on the p
    as some kind of seperation).\r\n\r\nNeo Sans does seem less strict. It feels extremely
    child-safe, actually; follows the current corporate re-branding trend of having
    no sharp edges. The more I look at it, the more I see that decapitated i as a
    small cap thrown right in the middle of s and m, interrupting the lowercase.\r\n\r\nThen
    again, I could just be weird. I love the name you got going, I understand the
    logic behind it perfectly and I think it's creative."

  body: I like the new one way better than the previous one for the simple fact that
    it looks simpler :) That said, I also think 'a' may use some tweaking as it sort
    of sticks out with its shape being somewhat more complex than those of other letters.

  body: "Thank you both for your feedback.\r\n\r\n<strong>@David Boni:</strong> The
    reason why I decided to go with a lowercase 's' was, that I wanted to bring in
    more geometry. As a result of this, I also dropped the tittle. Both decisions
    lead to the impression of having an optical middle -- the 'l' respectively 'ple'.
    That's exactly the area where the words 'simple' and 'please' are blurred together.
    I want to emphasize those two words instead of 'simple ease', simply because many
    austrians don't know the word 'ease' -- most of the tested persons were able to
    see a connection to 'easy', but many don't know the 'ease of use'. That's why
    we decided to make the 'ease' kind of a bonus, for those who know the 'ease of
    use'. For all the others we have the word 'simple' which is easily associated
    with the industry (User Experience Design), and we have the word 'please', which
    is one of the first english words people learn in school. As a result we hope
    to get a very memorable name.\r\n\r\nI agree that it reads 'sim please', but actually
    that's also how it's pronounced by most people. Nevertheless I will try a dot
    on the 'i' to see how it works -- thank you for this comment.\r\n\r\n<strong>@epsilicon:</strong>
    Thank you for your exquisite font-list. I've already tried some of your suggestions
    a few months ago, when I started to set the letters in different typefaces. Anyway,
    some of them are new to me and so I will definitely take a closer look at those.
    Thanks for your work, I appreciate it a lot."

    3,75 mm which equals 71 lines per page. The leading of the copy was adjusted to

    column width for the copy I decided to divide this part into 2 different columns.
    The right one is for the text and the left one provides meta information to improve
    scanability. The longest line within the copy contains 64 characters.\r\n\r\nThe
    idea was to design a very simple layout that suits our identity and considers
    all the 'rules' of typography. To design something like a 'user-experience' I
    decided to provide the reader with meta information which dramatically reduces
    the effort of finding the needed information -- let's just call it a more efficient
    way of reading and rechecking the content. Nevertheless this meta information
    is not meant to be headlines and so the text of a document always has to be coherent
    without the need of reading the meta information. (for all native german speakers:
    right now it doesn't -- this is just some sort of placeholder text)\r\n\r\nAny
    kind of feedback would be well appreciated and very helpful since I would like
    to carry on with the rest of our CI."
