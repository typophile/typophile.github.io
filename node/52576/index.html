		<div class="commentbody">It is actually an interesting question. You mention, honestly, that you have exhibited trollish behavior. I would guess that what you are talking about is, in a sense, playing devil's advocate, as it is said, to stimulate and push a discussion forward. I think this is a very good point.

As far as the ethnicity issue, I would mention that I recently fed a troll a Borat flavored morsel. I really see a similarity. I guess there are those that treat a board as a holy receptacle of knowledge where no sideways comments or anything that does not explicitly contribute to the discussion should be tolerated. Personally, I believe a well crafted digression can be a welcome contribution.

Consider the specifics here though. Why would anyone attack E.S. for owning "cool fonts". It isn't a legit crit—just a silly joke. One that I admit I do not get the point of at all.</div>

James (jupiterboy) mentioned Borat - I think that's probably a fair comparison. Whether or not you find that sort of thing funny or even acceptable is of course another matter.

Christopher, a troll (in this context) is basically a forum member who posts argumentative, rude, or controversial material, just for the sake of riling others. They're pretty rare on Typophile (as a member of several gaming forums it's pretty blissful spending some time here!)

A fuller explanation can be found <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)'>here</a>.

Simon do you suggest that entire population of Tokyo is raving lunatics with broken English? Gui Yong is native of Honshū Island and is very well read man, in spite of occasional bananas postings. He make no issues of race and belong only to lunatic stereotypes.

Many love and I wish very best of fun,

And the Borat reference is spot on. Which makes me think the issue is not a problem for most people. Lots of people, probably most people, don’t have a problem with Borat, but personally I wasn’t able to watch more than fifteen minutes.

Are you not familiar with the book 'The Lord of the Rings'?
You can google 'Orcs' and find out quite a lot about them.
You really can't mistake one once met. Very unpleasant creatures.
They tend to show up here quite often. When one appears it attracts one or two others and they carry on so in their own unintelligible mutterings, mostly harmless but very annoying.

I am surprised that an informed type historian such as yourself has not come across this most noteworthy of all sans from the complete Orcfont family. This innovative and ground breaking font is so revolutionary as to be totally devoid of substance all together. Its characterless features are mind numbing in their simplicity without one redeeming virtue. What is most striking in 'San Intelligence' is not what appears to the eye, but what banality has gone on in its creation and development.
A watershed of type design which no other can come close to, or even wish to.

'Sans Intelligence' is pure type, its perfection is an indefinable property that only sensitive critics (liken to yourself, Gui Yong) can intuitively recognise in a work of art. Unfortunately insensitive critics (such as Mr Typerror - please excuse his ignorance) are unable to appreciate its full and unique magnificence.

I used to see a hell of a lot of issues with trolls making a total (expelative deleted) of themselves in various other forums  

which is why i follow the dont feed the trolls rule. Simple reasoning being is if you give them fuel it will go on to making the trolls fire worse and make them contuine. 

if all people followed that simple mantra.. the world of forums would be a better place due to trolls realising they wont win :)
Having said that though virtual napalm usually works in most cases to get rid of a stubbon troll. But i wouldn't advise that as it is rather painful for the troll to get a virtual kick in the nuts.

@cyclonkitten: <em>if all people followed that simple mantra.. the world of forums would be a better place due to trolls realising they wont win :)</em>

I couldn't agree more. At Wikipedia trolls & cranks disrupt the editing process, and we just block them, these annoying disruptive and often sociopathic attention-seekers.

<em>Having said that though virtual napalm usually works in most cases to get rid of a stubbon troll. But i wouldn’t advise that as it is rather painful for the troll to get a virtual kick in the nuts.</em>

Well, you know I get butch about this, the task of enforcing the rules and guidelines designed to promote topical discussion and hose out the anti-social elements.

Trolls are "fair game". Come in here and show your contempt for our community and you will get a "virtual" kick in the nuts from me. Trolls and cranks should know that Arbo loves playing hardball with their kind, yes. I actually enjoy playing you,

Well there is enforcing the rules.. and then there is flame wars trolls vs the rest of us. I rather have the rules enforced than have a flame war with a troll.. 

If the thread gets out of hand with the troll then virtual napalm rules apply (which means moderators get involved and the whole nine yards)

It's the base standard for civility in web communities which have not yet institutionalized formal rules and guidelines for civility. The no ad hominem rule doesn't apply to trolls because they flout that basic rule, and this is how they turn themselves into fair game.

<em>James you are a bit strange.</em>

You wouldn't last 5 minutes in my world, dude.

When I have a thing to say to you, you should try assume good faith, for while it may sting at the time, eventually I will teach you to fly strate. I've had much success with much taller and tuffer customers than you.

Peace.

Personally I was not annoyed by Guiyong, except when he apparently dropped in serious discussions, and apparently with a wish to contribute, and then disappeared (see my thread about Language coverage and Unicode).
I enjoy some of your lunatics' irony, Gui, but I have difficulties in thinking you are effectively Japanese: do you have some work on the web to show? If you are not Japanese it's not a problem, as long as you are not bugging me with your "cool fonts" delirium… :=)

Sii: not knowing you, I was annoyed by your ermetic apparent irony and words, but it consoles me a lot to read you disliked Borat. That "movie" is an offense to the world… :=)</div>
