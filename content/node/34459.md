    sell house."

  body: "<em>It looks close to normal helvetica</em>\r\n\r\nBut it was redrawn, and
    has many more weights, which are organized logically, similar to the way they
    are in Univers. And like Stephen says, you can purchase a few weights at a time.
    No need to sell the house. :-)"
