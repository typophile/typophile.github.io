  body: "Your sample looks like it may be hand-drawn, partly because the stress is
    unusual. Normally the O would not be stressed on one side like that, and usually
    the other leg of the A is the stressed one, I think. One font I know with a similar
    O is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-juanita/\">Parisian</a>,
    and a 'Latin' styled font could be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-juanita/\">ITC
    Juanita</a>, particularly the condensed versions.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
