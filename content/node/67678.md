body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am currently writing a major book about the life and
  work of Roger Excoffon, that will be published by Atelier Perrousseaux in french
  and english at the spring 2011. It will feature a never-published before interview
  of Excoffon, participations by designers and friends such as Jose Mendoza y Almeida,
  an introduction by Massin, and a lot of high quality visuals. I have acquired an
  important iconography, but I am still missing some items, so I need your help.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have ANY documents regarding Roger Excoffon (type specimen, metal fonts, drawings,
  letters, photographs...), I would be glad to hear about it; any photograph or scan
  provided would of course be aknowledged, and a copy of the book would be on your
  way as soon as it's released.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\nDavid Rault"

  body: I'm a bit surprised at the non-response as well - maybe we (as a Typophile
    community) don't have any material in regards to Excoffon? At any rate, good luck
    with the book.

    have something. Gerard gives a lecture at Reading on mid-century French type that
    could convert the most stubborn of modernist. '

    you familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.rencontresdelure.org/\">Rencontres
    de Lure</a> gatherings in the foothills of the French Alps, which have been a
    cornerstone of French typographic culture since 1951? Excoffon used to attend,
    as did many people who knew and worked with him. Of course, most if not all of
    that generation is now gone, but there may still be people involved who met him."

  body: "Miss Tiffany: it will be big, thick, printed on a white matte paper, full
    of never-seen before texts and great illustrations - but unfortunately, it's very,
    very hard to locate good documents, for most of them basically disappeared. I
    am working as hard as possible to retrieve everything I can. I will contact Gerard
    Unger; in order to save time, would you by any chance have an email where I could
    reach him?\r\n\r\nJohn: I did contact Jean-Francois, he will actually participate
    to the book as well. I am very familiar with the Rencontres de Lure, I was actually
    in Lurs a few month ago, at Francois Richaudeau's house, overlooking the very
    house of Roger Excoffon. As you said, most of them are now gone, and I contacted
    the few remaining ones without much success, apart from Yves Perrousseaux and
    Jose Mendoza y Almeida.\r\n\r\nWolfgang: I did send an email to Sebastien Morlighem,
    and am now waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone,\r\ndavid"
