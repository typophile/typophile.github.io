  body: I&#39;ll be there, from Thursday night to Wednesday night. <BR> <BR>Dan, remind
    me to take you to the rooftop restaurant/bar of the Virgin megastore in downtown
    to listen to the glorious prayer calls of the nearby mosque over some cocktails.
    That&#39;s half of Beirut&#39;s essence right there. The other half is currently
    dormant. <BR> <BR>hhp

    with mild temperatures, who can resist? Especially when the food is so great...
    I can&#39;t wait.  <BR> <BR>There are so many interesting people that are attending,
    and there&#39;s a nice surprise to be announced. <BR> <BR>Hrant, last thing I
    heard was that the rooftop restaurant is closed for business. However, there&#39;s
    very nice places around and I recomend Al-Balad restaurant for Lebanese food and
    IL Parliamento for Italien food, and Casper for international food and good coffee.
    Also, you can&#39;t miss out on the Bliss House sandwiches and cocktails.... Expect
    at least 3 extra kilos for the week. Yummy.'
