body: Hey there, burgeoning typophile here. I saw this font yesterday and felt like
  I had seen it a thousand times before. The first place I turned was here (http://www.flickr.com/photos/djll/sets/72157608369709836/?page=3),
  but it wasn't in there. The sample I posted contains the uppercase E, as that was
  the letter that struck me most. Thanks for any help.
