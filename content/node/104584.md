  It's still (roughly) the same logo we use today, but I think it may actually have
  been a real type and not a one-off drawing like many others. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n<img

  body: The four E's are the only repeated letters. Allowing for small errors in inking
    and uneven paper, etc, they all look very similar and it could have been a type.
    However if you look at the first two E's their verticals meet the lower horizontals
    differently at the inner corner - at a curve in the first one but a sharp 90 degrees
    in the second...hmm.

    various foundries. Here is one recently digitized by Jeff Levine:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Publication
