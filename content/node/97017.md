  you fine folk. :) And due to disclosures I apologise for the secretive nature of
  this post..\r\n\r\nI've used two typefaces designed by a well-known foundry, for
  a well-known brand's new logo redesign (which will appear internationally in a fairly
  large public scale)..\r\n\r\nThe client is aware that they'll need to license both
  typefaces. Typeface 1 appears in the logotype with minimal modifications in two
  characters (arms/bar extended 5%, counter opened 25%, roughly). Typeface 2 appears
  in the logotype too of which three characters are minimally modified (bar extended
  to match arms, terminal altered).\r\n\r\n(Additional info, though might be irrelevant..)
  Typeface 2 may also be used, unmodified, for headline use in all of the brand's
  comms materials (I haven't made a final decision on this yet).\r\n\r\nJust wondering
  what is the rule for a situation like this? Does etiquette call for giving a courtesy
  notice to the foundry regarding the type modifications made for the logotype? I'd
  like to stress that the modifications are almost negligible.. Well at least based
  on rebrand projects I've done in the past, this one's pretty negligible. ;)\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the long-winded post!"

    I found my answer. Crap. :(\r\n\r\n..Or does that only apply only to the typeface
    as a whole? And not to an application of the typeface (if that makes sense)?\r\n\r\nI
    once worked with a typographer to make a proprietary cut of DIN for a client (for
    their exclusive corporate use). We contacted the foundry as a courtesy and they
    laughed us off saying of course it's fine.. I was hoping it's the same for this
    foundry. :/"

  body: I hope you worked with a type designer, not a typographer. Anyway, foundries
    rarely allowed modifications to the font files, but when you make a logo what
    you modify is typically a vector file made from the font file, not the font file
    itself.
