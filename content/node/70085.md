body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/del_3773.gif]\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to see
  how my sketches work together... I prepared four typical OT features, containing
  initial, medial, final and isolated letterforms. The results in FontLab's preview
  window don't correspond with arabic ortography. It looks like I should prepare additional
  lookup(s) to substitute medial forms followed by a right-joining (or non-joining)
  letter. Am I right? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"
