  body: "This seems to be the bold italic cut of a typeface called \u2018Eng Gothic\u2019
    (cf. <a href=\"http://www.whatfontis.com/Eng-Gothic-BoldItalic.font\">this</a>
    sample). It is apparently contained in the <a href=\"http://www.broderbund.com/p-47-clickart-fonts-v5-2009.aspx\">ClickArt
    Fonts</a> package by Br\xF8derbund and can also be found on some more or less
    dubious free font sites."
