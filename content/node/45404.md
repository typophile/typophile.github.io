  to design when starting a font? Do they get left until last, or do you get them
  out of the way first? Are they the ones that are simple or complicated?\r\nI've
  only started on one family but it seems my least favourites are left until last
  in all of the weights. I think I don't like the ones that seem like their shapes
  can withstand less experimentation (like M, V or Y), or are similar to other shapes
  (P or Q), and love the freedom of experimentation with complicated curvy shapes
  (like a, g, e, s). I like designing x too. \r\nI find number glyphs the hardest,
  but that's probably because in my daily life I am subjected to more letters than
  numbers so they are more familiar.\r\nDoes anyone else find the same thing?\r\n\r\n"

    they seem simple, but there''s a lot of things going on in that ellipse that need

  body: "I struggle with x (and X). It's a stealthy bugger. It's a relatively simple
    beast to start with, but if it needs adjusting its simple demeanour hides a complex
    and time-consuming beast. Getting the optical compensation on the bottom-left
    to top-right stroke is a bugger to adjust if you need to flesh it out or slim
    it a bit. It being at the end of the alphabet doesn't help either. You think you're
    nearly there with your adjustments and x takes you an hour. The bastard!\r\n\r\noO0
    are all a bit trecherous, but that's probably down to the fact they are so fundamental.
    I mean, an o is primary, wheras an h falls out of an n.\r\n\r\n8 is a toughie
    too. But an enjoyable one. 4's a stiff beast. 2 is quite gratifying. I like the
    numbers in general. As Jonathan Hoefler pointed out in a talk recently, their
    open sides are (mainly) opposite to the Roman alphabet: They open to the left.
    When you get on to them it makes for a refreshing change.\r\n\r\nI like g though.
    g's a pleasure. Nicer than G, which I often have trouble disconnecting from the
    C. s & S are good too. Complex is often satisfying. Z, though simple, always comes
    out easily. It seems to sit more solidly than most. Sitting it back on its haunches
    is satisfying. I like the fact it's 'backwards' too -- thick stroke on the 'wrong'
    diagonal."

  body: "L. \r\n\r\nYou would think a letter so minimal would be easy to design or
    set, but it is the complete opposite. I have always found that the lack of space,
    ends up  \"overshadowing\" any sort of harmony or clarity. This is especially
    obvious when two lower case L 's are together, or next to a lower case I."

  body: "I find following letters hardest in Antiqua Roman: g, \u0292 (that's a long
    z, not an old-style 3), 8 and old-style (i.e. x-height) 2, though for different
    reasons. In the case of \"g\" I have trouble because of its form, I tend to want
    to play around with it, to innovate (a lot!) but then have to realise, that in
    a conventional font you might not be too far from designs known by the reader,
    and I find myself bound by tradition. I'd really love to conceptualise the g,
    but in non-display fonts, the strong deviation from readers' expectation is a
    no-no. Actually, I blame the type designers of old, when they derived conceptual
    forms from calligraphic ones, they would not do so with g, even emphasising its
    calligraphic origins. The \u0292 is troublesome, as I'd like it to harmonize well
    with both g and z. Most fonts use regular stroke width as defined by ductus for
    that letter, while z uses the reversed one. I dislike that. 8 makes most trouble
    in bold faces. But the book and light faces have to harmonise with the bold one
    within the family. Old-style 2 is a b****, actually all figures make troubles,
    as they keep the ductus-induced stroke width, while in the case of the lc letters
    the pen-determined stroke width is overlayed by forms and ductus-considerations
    from the (epigraphic) capitals. A formalisation, that has never been done consequently
    historically, and now is \"tradition\". The vertical stroke of old-style 5 in
    roman fonts is hard as well.\r\n"

    asking, which is your least favourite child. I don't think you have one. You love

    you have to make more than A-Z and the worst historically have been 'fractions'
    everyone in every technology always hated doing the production of fractions. The
    two others are in the image above and they need to be in every font now if you

    the W and w are difficult! I can't seem to master 2 and 3 either, no matter whether
    lining or oldstyle!\r\nI guess the challenge should makes you experiment more
    creatively how to resolve difficult shapes, so they should turn out more interesting."
