body: "When working on a font, I like to increment my source files with a two-digit
  version number (foobar 02.vfb, foobar 03.vfb) so I can generate test OTFs with a
  version number.\r\n\r\nThe annoyance is that after I generate, I always have to
  drag the new version into Font Book and delete the old versions manually (because
  Font Book resolves duplicates erratically, usually preferring older files).\r\n\r\nIn
  the past, I've tried to set up a Folder Action to process new fonts, but it takes
  too long for Folder Action to notice that I made a new file.\r\n\r\nNo more. Now
  I've discovered Hazel, which is a little $20 program (preference pane) that's basically
  a much more attentive version of Folder Actions. Which makes it actually useful.\r\n\r\nI
  generate my test OTF to the desktop. (Because it's the easiest destination to navigate
  to from the FL generate-font dialog.) My Hazel script watches for OTF files to drop
  onto the desktop. If it sees one that was created in the last minute (and it will
  grab them within a few seconds of their appearance), it deletes the older versions
  of that font from my ~/Library/Fonts, and moves the newest version there. If Font
  Book is running, it will automatically notice the change.\r\n\r\nWhat's cool about
  Hazel is that you can embed shell scripts in your sequence of folder actions. So
  in this case, to do the \"delete older versions\" magic, I made a little perl script
  that looks at my new font & deletes anything in my font folder with the same filename
  prefix.\r\n\r\nYou would want to adjust this for your naming scheme. (And as usual,
  be careful of any script with an rm in it.)\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#!/usr/bin/perl\r\n\r\nuse
  warnings;\r\nuse strict;\r\nuse File::Basename;\r\n\r\n# extract the filename from
  the pathname Hazel passes in\r\nmy $filename = basename($ARGV[0]);\r\n\r\n# this
  matches a filename of the form:\r\n# prefix version number (optional version suffix).otf\r\n#
  like foobar 02a.otf\r\n($filename =~ m/(.+?)(\\d{2,3})(.*?)\\.otf/);\r\n\r\n# get
  the family name if it matched\r\nmy $familyname = $1;\r\n\r\n# if there's no $familyname,
  abort\r\nexit(0) unless $familyname;\r\n\r\n# remove the fonts that have the same
  family name prefix\r\nmy $output = `rm ~/Library/Fonts/'$familyname'*`;\r\n\r\n#
  Hazel continues after this, moving the new font into the directory\r\n\r\nexit(0);\r\n</code>\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"

    and generate test fonts directly into /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts
    directory using Ben Kiel\u2019s font generator script, overwriting the old font.
    Indesign automatically detects new or changed fonts and loads them on the fly.
    This will you save many hours of time that would otherwise be wasted incrementing
    font versions, restarting applications, clearing font caches, rebooting, dealing
    with Fontbook, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd increment your entire working directory instead
    of individual files. It\u2019s faster and this way you also end up archiving the
    related files you create for Superpolator, UFO Stretch, notes you take, etc. If
    multiple users are working on a design they should increment each round of changes
    with a date/version number and their initials."
