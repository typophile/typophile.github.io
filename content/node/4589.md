  body: I&#39;d say more British really - it&#39;s hopefully for use with a Triumph
    garage/parts place... which is british and based in England - so I guess it&#39;s
    logical and suitable to use a British looking type. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>James <BR>

  body: Rad. I had a Triumph TR4A that I loved like a child. Unfortunately <BR>I was
    too poor at the time to do it justice and I sold it to an <BR>enthusiast who restored
    it to mint condition. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll think about good type for that realm.

    Chalet Comprime. <BR> <BR><a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=COMPRIME-FO"

    European in origin, if not specifically British, and giving a nod to the mod.

    But these might be more <i>classy</i> than <i>sporty</i>.
