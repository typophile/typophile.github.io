  attached a pdf for anyone who wants a closer look.\r\n\r\n(newb) Now I just need
  to get it into some font software. Is it even possible to copy and paste to fontographer

    is looking really good!\r\nthe only comment i have so far is to try dropping the
    dots of 'i' ang 'j' slightly lower.\r\nat the moment it looks like they're alligned
    to the ascenders.\r\nalso the r looks slightly heavy, however that might just
    be the screen (i haven't printed a proof yet). Also not too sure about that tail
    on the 'x'.\r\n\r\ngreat job for the 1st type though, mine is still in the process
    of incubation.\r\nand good on you for trying to do a text face, it's a challenging
    task.\r\n\r\n\r\nVictor"

  body: "Thanks for taking a look, Victor. You're definitely right about the i,and
    the j. I'm self-taught in regards to type design, I think I picked up aligning
    the dots to the ascenders from looking at types with much taller x-heights. \r\n\r\nThat
    r does look thick, but I'm not sure if the stem is too thick, or if that join
    needs to be toyed with. I'll see if I can't figure out something for that x.\r\n\r\nBen"

  body: "It's funny, the lowercase r immediately stood out for me, too, but I wasn't
    going to mention it until I saw the above comment! I agree, it does look overly
    heavy.\r\n\r\nI really dig the serifs along the baseline. They look like little
    cartoony feet on which the letters walk. Very cool.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase c looks
    too symmetric to me. I feel it could benefit if the bottom part didn't flare upwards
    so much. I don't think the top part should be any heavier. Sorry, I'm not sure
    of the correct terms for these part of the c, but I hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nThe
    little serif on the top of the lowercase g is barely hanging on! The rest of the
    letter is beautiful though.\r\n\r\nMy favorite letters in this face (in no particular
    order) are g m x, and h\r\n\r\nLooking great. Keep it up!"

  body: This looks great to me. The top of the f might need some strengthening, and
    the bottom vertices of v and w are too soft I think.
