  body: Hey Roger, welcome to typophile! <BR> <BR>This is a very interesting mark
    you having going. Good idea with the &#39;t&#39; &#39;c&#39; lig. Should the red
    circle be a bit smaller? Or perhaps the glyph needs to be wider? It seems to me
    that there is too much red space on either side.  <BR>As for true caliber, maybe
    try another typeface?   I&#39;d like to see what everyone else thinks about that.
    <BR> <BR>As for the positioning of everything, the mark may work better beside
    true caliber, rather than being centered on top.  <BR> <BR>I like how the red
    circle is a bullet hole, or maybe the back of a bullet. Perhaps you could develop
    on that more, by adding a ring around the edge or something? <BR> <BR>Just some
    thoughts <BR> <BR>Drew

  body: I love the type. I don&#39;t like the current relationship between the mark
    and logotype &#40;i.e. size, positioning, etc.&#41;. If you are, in fact, trying
    to portray some kind of bullet hole as Drew suggested, then maybe you can simply
    position a red circle behind the &#34;t&#34; and have some skattered red circles
    resembling bullet spray

  body: Thanks for all your feedback thus far. I&#39;m actually trying to shy away
    from the whole gun connotation. I am using the word caliber for it&#39;s meaning
    of quality, thus &#34;true quality&#34;. I have tried different scenarios with
    guns or gun imagery, but it&#39;s not the type of image I want to portray with
    the company. I want something along the lines of like the Psyop logo &#40;<a href="http://www.psyop.tv"
    target="_blank">www.psyop.tv</a>&#41; or Res &#40;<a href="http://www.res.com"
    target="_blank">www.res.com</a>&#41; Somethign that represents cutting-edge, but
    also can be a timeless mark if the company survives that long. <BR> <BR>Erik

  body: I can&#39;t stress how much stronger your first concept is compared to these.
    <BR> <BR>Since this is a production company, some subtle animation would be appropriate.
    The logotype &#40;from your first posting&#41; lends well to animating appearing/disappearing
    pieces of type. One method might be to start with a solid block and tear out chunks
    to reveal the letterforms, then randomly have pieces/chunks of the block reappear,
    then disappear again, and so on &#40;i.e. the counter of the &#34;e&#39;s&#34;,
    the bowl of the &#34;b&#34;, the chisel of the &#34;t&#34; arm, etc.&#41;

    aren&#39;t so insightful. I&#39;m learning too &#40;albeit slowly ;-&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m agreeing with Daniel, Dominik and Scott: the red circle version is
    the strongest. I wouldn&#39;t sweat the swoosh thing. There are some swooshy shapes,
    but none is individually a dominant element, and the feel isn&#39;t that arcy,
    swooshy curve. It&#39;s more of a vortex feel, drawing the eye into the center
    of the logo. The square version of same is my second-favorite, though I like it
    more each time I look. Perhaps try using a similar but less-compressed face for
    the &#39;true caliber&#39; to develop more horizontal motion, like the lig is
    a point on a timeline. <BR> <BR>The newer versions--the solid black type-only--don&#39;t
    do so much for me. The gothic &#39;TC&#39; ligature reads as a &#39;T&#39; to
    my eye, and there&#39;s too much whitespace between it and the &#39;aliber&#39;;
    looks like a hole. Where the red circle/square draws the eye into the ligature
    itself, the later versions draw the eye into a hole. The first is better in that
    respect, but there the lig feels too heavy. Maybe slim/reduce the back side of
    the &#39;T&#39;? Or use a contrasting color for the interior stroke? <BR> <BR>Also,
    you might try splitting up the &#39;ib&#39; ligature. Part of the strength of
    that face is the verticality, and connecting the dot on the &#39;i&#39; and the
    serif of the &#39;b&#39; interrupts a particularly strong vertical and, to my
    eye, disturbs the rhythm of the face. <BR> <BR>Last, I think you&#39;re going
    to get &#39;gun&#39; inferences from almost anything with your name. &#39;Caliber&#39;
    is just very closely associated with firearms. <BR> <BR>'

  body: What if you were to extend the red circle out a little, make it just a hair
    more elliptical?  The waist looks a little pinched to me; that might help make
    it feel more generous. <BR> <BR>On the i, I tend to agree with Chris - it occurred
    to me that you have a great opportunity there to use a right-triangle shape for
    the dot and reinforce your type&#39;s feel in what&#39;s right now not the most
    interesting glyph.  The t is excellent; all of &#34;true&#34; has a great diagonal
    force that &#34;caliber&#34; doesn&#39;t, maybe because you have two strongly
    vertical glyphs interrupting the diagonal movement.

    alt="swingc2"> <BR> <BR>Now I agree with you guys about the red circle version
    and although aesthetically it does flow a little better it just didn&#39;t represent
    the company truthfully. To me it looks like a logo for some homogenized software
    company. Sometimes it&#39;s not about whther looks good, but whether it feels
    good. This could work for my film company if I wanted to be a little more freewheeling
    with the stories I want to tell, but I definately want to make hard-hitting and
    challenging movies. Think of flicks like Traffic, Fight Club, Seven or the commercial
    work by Chris Cunningham and Spike Jonze. Irreverant, experimental, but always,
    always unpredictable. <BR> <BR>So have I got you guys sold? How could I improve
    on this one? I did take into account your input on the &#39;i&#39; so I stuck
    a dot right back in there. As far as the negative space in the middle of the ligature
    I like the fact it draws your eye to the middle and from there you discover the

    also second the concerns about the e-t join. I&#39;m not sold on the &#39;t/c&#39;-&#39;a&#39;
    join--though that&#39;s better than the other. Maybe try reworking the t-c lig
    to avoid joins with either word? Or maybe just flatten both curves a touch so
    they don&#39;t join at all? <BR> <BR>I also agree with you regarding the horizontal
    composition. Maybe you could dodge the joins and strengthen the horizontal in
    one swoop by reducing the x-height a touch? <BR> <BR>Regardless, I still find
    the &#39;lib&#39; spacing a teensy bit awkward in Scott&#39;s version. I definitely
    like the independent dot on the &#39;i&#39;, tho. Maybe BJ is onto something with
    a triangle for the dot of the &#39;i&#39;? Also, rather than reversing the serif
    on the &#39;l&#39; I might try ditching it entirely--or maybe that&#39;s an opportunity
    to reuse the notch from the &#39;t&#39;? <BR> <BR>Finally, I think the &#39;er&#39;
    join is a bit awkward with the tail &#40;or whatever the correct term is&#41;
    on the &#39;e&#39; sticking up like that. Maybe eliminate it? <BR> <BR>All niggles

    <BR> <BR>HHP, You know what I was thinking about that too! For readability sake
    I am threw the &#39;c&#39; back in, but also condensed some things to lessen the
    negative space in the ligature which was one of the main reasons we took the &#39;c&#39;
    out in the first place. I was even able to incorprate the tail back into the &#39;c&#39;
    which was a pleasant surprise. I re-did the ligature a bit and used the same arc
    for the top swoop that was used for the bottom swoop one to give it more sense
    of consistency and flow. Sorry if it seems if I keep going back and forth with
    stuff, but everytime I either step forward or backward it gets better so please
    bear with me. I am also trying the word cinema instead. Another stamp of &#39;seriousness&#39;
    that I would like the company to have. Suggestions? Death threats? let me know.
    <BR> <BR>BJ, Jeff, Yes that is Senator Ultra font from the Emigre family slightly

  body: Roger, I hate to be a partypooper, but I think that you have too much spice
    in your recipe. Did you switch to CINEMA from FILMS for a reason other than just
    to test the waters? It is probably too small for certain uses. The way you&#39;ve
    created almost a ligature from the way you&#39;ve joined the words and letters,
    while interesting, is perhaps too tricky. It could be read, by the casual glance
    as &#34;true T caliber&#34; or &#34;true C caliber&#34; it is almost redundant.
    In some ways, I think your original post is still the strongest. You used color
    and shape and placement to separate. You had a &#34;mark&#34; that could be used
    separately when necessary. The &#34;nipping and tucking&#34; you did to the emigre
    face is very nice, you should focus on that, and find a way to create a separate
    mark.

  body: I actually agree with you since I had the weekend to think about what direction
    my design was going. First and foremost it was getting too &#39;gothic-like&#39;
    and dark. Here is the logo that everyone seems to like. What fonts can you suggest
    that would complement it well? I&#39;m open to everybody&#39;s thoughts! <BR>
