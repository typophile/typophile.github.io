    it off by making only one small change--adding the extra ear.\r\n\r\nCome to think
    of it, I recall seeing a g with horns and a devil tail once. I think Hrant did
    something like that with one of his fonts recently, too."

    mean the \"g\" in Brutaal* (which is not too recent though) then I'd say it does
    indeed have a horn, but the lower bowl is supposed to be a maw (with an upper
    overbite**) not a tail! But really, whatever works for you...  :-)\r\n\r\n* http://themicrofoundry.com/other/Brutaal-g.gif\r\n\r\n**
    The lower bowl of the \"g\" in its companion Domination Available has a lower
    overbite. Upper overbite is sinister (think eagle), lower is bestial (think ape).
    I REALLY LIKE lower overbites (when they're not more than ~3 millimeters).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
