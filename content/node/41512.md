  body: 'I ended up changing this quite a bit when I got back to it last night. It
    would appear that this type ''unified look'' stuff is easier said than done. I''m
    feeling like my caps are the least interesting thing of the whole bunch, and the
    numbers look almost italicized. Maybe I should work on some italics for the lowercase
    and then come up with a better looking uppercase to match the style that these
    have taken upon themselves. '
