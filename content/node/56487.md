  \r\n\r\ncan anyone school me on hangul typography/type design?\r\nwhat, if any are
  the helvetica(s) of hangul?\r\n\r\none thing im struggling a bit with is the positioning
  of each sub glyph within glyphs and things i should take into consideration. been
  collecting up all the flyers and newspapers i can get for free and studying them
  but it would be nice to have the korean equivalent of EoTS and the like\r\n\r\ncant
  seem to find a great deal on the net in english\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany info is much
  appreciated i love the look of hangul\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\n\r\np.s korea
  is flipping amazing"

  body: "Good luck in Korea! I am no longer based in Seoul, and I've left all my Korean
    typography-related books back there, so I'm afraid I can't be of much help. You
    should know that you won't find anything in English at the level of detail you
    are looking for, seeing that you are concerned about the positioning of subglyphs
    within glyphs. Even books and monographs in Korean will seldom go beyond the obvious
    stuff about optical correction, because for native readers of hangul, the sense
    of balance between the subglyphs is pretty much assumed to be ingrained and would
    be very hard to explain analytically.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if you happen to be
    interested in hangul type design, you can try drawing a few glyphs and I'll be
    happy to comment on them. I've never seen non-native readers of hangul make serious
    attempts in designing hangul, so I would be interested to see what you can produce.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    here are some links that may be helpful for the pictures at least until you get
    your Korean up to speed. The first link in particular contains links to several
    essays about designing hangul typefaces, with pictures of corrections made along
    the way.\r\n\r\nhttp://yoonfont.co.kr/yoonstory/yoonessay.asp\r\nhttps://www.fontclub.co.kr/main.asp\r\n\r\nThe
    <em>Geulkkol</em> \uAE00\uAF34 annuals published by the Korea Font Development
    Center (\uD55C\uAD6D\uAE00\uAF34\uAC1C\uBC1C\uC6D0) are really helpful and contain
    some interesting studies as well as an overview of new hangul typeface designs
    published during the year. They should be available in the biggest book stores.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the Helveticas of hangul, much of contemporary hangul type is heavily indebted
    to the designs of the late Choe Jeongho (\uCD5C\uC815\uD638). His creations are
    Myeongjo (\uBA85\uC870), Gothic (\uACE0\uB515), Sinmyeongjo (\uC2E0\uBA85\uC870),
    Hwangodik (\uD658\uACE0\uB515), Graphic (\uADF8\uB798\uD53D), Gongjak (\uACF5\uC791),
    Gungsuh (\uAD81\uC11C), and Naru (\uB098\uB8E8). Of these, Myeongjo and Sinmyeongjo
    are the progenitors of virtually all the serif designs used for books today, and
    Gothic is the basis of the most widely used class of sans-serifs that I like to
    think of as hangul grotesques.\r\n\r\nWindows faces Batang (\uBC14\uD0D5) and
    Dotum (\uB3CB\uC6C0) are based on Sinmyeongjo/Myeongjo and Gothic respectively,
    Gulim (\uAD74\uB9BC) is based on Naru, and Gungsuh also closely follows Choe's
    design.\r\n\r\nLinks about Choe (in Korean):\r\nhttp://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/font/contents_read.asp?idx=494&p=5&parentidx=494&page=1&category=66\r\nhttp://www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/font/contents_read.asp?idx=495&parentidx=494&page=2&category=66\r\n\r\nMalgun
    Gothic (\uB9D1\uC740\uACE0\uB515), introduced with Windows Vista, is less indebted
    to Gothic; it is a pretty significant departure representing contemporary trends
    in hangul sans-serif design. If Choe's Gothic is Helvetica or Akzidenz Grotesque,
    then Malgun Gothic might be a Meta.\r\n\r\nAs for what Jooha is saying, yes, what
    he says is pretty much spot on."

  body: "actually there is one more question...\r\n\r\none thing ive noticed about
    korean typography is that it is common for prices to be in a roman typeface eg.
    1000 won\r\n\r\nwhat is the deciding factor of what roman face to use? or is it
    pretty haphazard. have there been any multi-lingual faces designed? (roman/hangul)
    \r\n\r\nwith either the roman derived from the hangul or vice-versa\r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: "I'm not sure why prices in particular would necessarily be in a Roman typeface,
    but yes, Korean typography often requires the Roman alphabet for a variety of
    reasons.\r\n\r\nVirtually all Korean fonts include letters of the Latin (Roman)
    alphabet. There are some designs where the Latin component is decent and harmonizes
    well with the hangul glyphs, but often the Latins are poorly designed. If one
    deems the available Latin component of a given Korean font to be unusable, it
    may be substituted with a Latin design that matches well with the hangul. Matching
    the colour, metrics, and the general feel is key. Because hangul and the Latin
    alphabet are structurally very different, you can't go much further than that.\r\n\r\nI
    am not aware of any hangul design which derives from a Latin design. It usually
    goes the other way, which explains why the Latins that come with Korean fonts
    are often unsuitable for Latin-heavy typography. In addition to the Latin being
    made subservient to the hangul, the designers don't have a good feel for what
    makes a successful Latin design."

  body: "<cite> In addition to the Latin being made subservient to the hangul</cite>\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    not common in the font world.  I wonder why more Korean fonts aren't being made.
    \ While the Korean unicode chart is rather scary looking, for body faces it's
    more than doable I'd think.  While you do have to draw a few more glyphs, most
    glyphs only need a certain number of forms and then they can be mixed and matched
    with references.  Display and caligraphic fonts couldn't do this though probably.\r\n\r\nOr
    am I over \"simplifying\" * it too much Jongseong?  For example, some consonants
    would need as many as 18 initial forms (horiz or vert or horiz-vert vowel, final
    consonant or no, single or doubled in first or second position, 3x2x3) and up
    to 9 final forms (horiz or vert or horiz-vert vowel, single or doubled in first
    or second position, 3x3).  Of course, many in modern hangul would not need anywhere
    near this many forms, for example, \u3141 only needs 6 initial forms, since it
    cannot be placed in a double consonant, and only 3 final forms.  \r\n\r\nVowels
    need seven forms: \r\n- isolate\r\n- monophthong\r\n- monophthong with final consonant\r\n-
    notched (heaven) diphthong\r\n- notched diphthong with final consonant\r\n- horizontal-vertical
    (earth-man) diphthong\r\n- horizontal-vertical diphthong with final consonant\r\n\r\nOnce
    those are designed it's just a massive copy and paste job.\r\n\r\nFor example
    using placeholders \u3147, \u3161, \u3163, with \u1100, you can have \u1100 \uAE30
    \uAE45 \uB07C \uB091 \uADF8 \uAE0D \uB044 \uB059 \uAE14 \uAE29 \uB060 \uB075 \uC775
    \uC73D \uC759.  But it's modular such that replacing \u3147 in \uAE45 with any
    other letter, the \u1100 and \u3163 maintain the same form: \uAE41\uAE46\uAE37\uAE31\uAE43\uAE40\uAE34\uAE45\uAE38
    .\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta
    de pintarla nosotros mismos\xBB. (La Luz Oscura, por Javier Guerrero)</em>\r\n\r\n*
    this means the average Korean letter has many more \"forms\" than an Arabic letter,
    although it's essentially just different ways of squashing the letters in the
    block rather than a wholly different shape like in Arabic."

  body: "It's not that simple. I think it's best to illustrate with an example, with
    Nanum Myeongjo bold.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gi_4604.gif]\r\n\r\nAt
    first glance, the \u3131 and \u3163 might appear to be simple copy and paste jobs,
    but a closer look reveals that the shapes and positions differ slightly according
    to what syllable finals they combine with. I don't think all of the \u3131s above
    are unique, but I count at least ten different variations.\r\n\r\nThere are of
    course short-cuts, but it is not as straightforward as you might first imagine.
    A very simple modular set-up of the kind you are thinking will yield a typeface
    that looks uneven, unbalanced, and full of gaps, and simply will not cut it for
    body type (unless you are deliberately going for a typewriter look).\r\n\r\nIt
    is generally agreed that at least hundreds of syllable elements are needed to
    design decent-looking hangul. According to the so-called Leeks Curve which correlates
    the number of syllable elements to the aesthetic level of the resulting hangul
    design, 300 elements are the absolute minimum, 900 elements are needed for basic
    book work, and 1858 elements will be enough for a near-perfect rendering of the
    11,172 syllables used in modern Korean.\r\n\r\nA common approach is to design
    the most common glyphs, fine-tuning them individually, and then using those designs
    to extract the syllable elements needed to assemble the rest of the glyphs. I
    think in the case of Nanum Myeongjo and several others the most common hangul
    glyphs\u2014typically the 2,350 syllables in the old encoding\u2014are individually
    designed, and the rest of the 11,172 syllables used in modern Korean are provided
    as composites in the font files.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ironically, the simple modular
    approach would be best for display faces where the quirkiness introduced by the
    obvious modularity would be more likely to be tolerated than in body faces."

    creations?\r\n\r\nInsadong is a great place for art books in general and for books
    on Korean calligraphy in particular. I can't immediately think of other places
    for type-related books, but used book stores in general can be treasure troves
    for calligraphy-related books. I found a copy of a great calligraphy exhibition
    catalogue in a used book store near my previous home in Bongcheon-dong. I seem
    to recall there are lots of used book stores in the Cheonggyecheon area.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    keep on eye out for typography- and calligraphy-related exhibitions in the galleries
    and museums around Seoul. It might be difficult to find information in English,
    so you might want to ask around with your Korean colleagues. There was an interesting
    exhibition of hangul tablets at the Seoul Arts Centre last year; I should upload
