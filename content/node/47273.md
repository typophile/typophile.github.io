body: "Hey all-\r\n\r\nI'm trying to reorganize my font library and I'm wondering
  what systems of organization people around here use. As you might expect, I have
  thousands of fonts in various formats. Often there are multiple iterations of the
  same font in Post script, Open type, etc. I use Extensis Suitcase Fusion 12 for
  management so really my question is threefold:\r\n\r\n1) How should I organize the
  physical font directories on my hard drive?\r\n\r\n  1.1) Is there a comprehensive
  list of fonts by category/class out there somewhere that's easy to read or search
  that I could reference to build a logical directory structure? (i.e. Hard Drive
  > Shared User > My Fonts > Sans > Grotesque sans > Helvetica)\r\n\r\n2) What's the
  best way to organize Suitcase to exploit this logical system so that I don't have
  to manually add categories and classifications to every file using the drag-and-drop
  functionality from the classification drawer?\r\n\r\nThanks, y'all. Looking forward
  to your input!\r\n-Jordachio"

  body: "Is that working for you? My main concern is being able to search through
    an extensive font library for something to suit whatever the need may be. That
    is, when working on a given project, I often think, \"Hmm... this could really
    use a big, powerful bold slab serif or maybe something more ornate like a thick
    western face.\" So how do I organize in such a way that I can search every thick
    slab serif that I have or every western display face that I have?\r\n\r\nPS. I
    also went a little crazy a while back and eventually gave up on the impossible
    task of classifying everything. Hence, the call for suggestions!  :)"

  body: "Font Agent Pro has taken a first, albeit small, step forward in this regard...
    the current version (4) of FAPro has a \"classify\" feature built-in. In their
    words:\r\n\r\n\"New Font Classification capabilities allow browsing by font category
    and style, as well as manual entry of classification.\"\r\n\r\n...the upshot is
    that many of the \"major\" label fonts have been categorized already, and you
    can manually assign existing or new categories of your own. FAPro also includes
    nice search capabilities, letting you search by just about any factor - including
    foundry.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought this would be a godsend, as I've been meaning to
    do what you're attempting for years - organize my library(s). Of course, this
    implies that i have the TIME to do this, which I never seem to have."

  body: "<strong>To Scott:</strong> I did read through a forum thread (3 years in
    the making! > http://typophile.com/node/5563) that supports Font Agent Pro as
    well. Suitcase has similar search functions and classifications and although I'm
    more familiar with it, I'd be willing to make the switch to something even easier.
    I'll check it out - thanks.\r\n\r\n<strong>To Nick:</strong> You're absolutely
    right about eliminating excess fonts from my library. As Scott, above you, points
    out the real kicker there is the TIME to do that. I've collected so much garbage
    over the years that what I need to do is exactly what you suggest and sit down
    to eliminate surplus nonsense. That's part of what I want to accomplish in organizing.
    Something that would be helpful in this respect would be a database of sorts,
    that allows me to search fonts and outputs a classification so that I don't have
    to cruise my memory banks (and/or type books) to assign classes to every font.
    Do you know of any such thing?\r\n\r\nOn a similar note of simplification, what
    do you consider \"usable\" in the world of fonts? I've read several books on the
    topic including \"30 Essential Typefaces for a Lifetime\" and I'm anxiously awaiting
    \"Fifty Designers' Current Favourite Typefaces,\" the UNICEF project, but I would
    be interested in your input. How long is an <strong>usable</strong> (not <em>essential</em>)
    list? Thanks for the input!"

  body: "Jordan, I don't think there are too many short cuts.\r\nProblem is, classification
    is very subjective, beyond sans, serif, and script.\r\nThere are various classification
    schemes, so perhaps what you should do is pick one you feel comfortable with,
    and go through your collection, classifying accordingly.\r\nOr make up your own!\r\n\r\nOr
    make it multi-dimensional, using keywords, so you could sort by:\r\n-foundry\r\n-date\r\n-usage
    (eg text or display)\r\n-features (eg does it have small caps, lining/osf?0\r\n-historical
    style\r\n-genre (eg girly script, upscale, techno, etc.)\r\n-etc\r\n\r\nAs for
    usable, I have Type Odyssey 2 on CD, but none installed.\r\nIf I'm searching for
    a typeface I think might be on there, I wade through the booklet.\r\n\r\nI tend
    to think that if one is looking for the right type for a particular job, it's
    worth the effort to spend several hours looking for it."

    drag-and-drop 'drawer' which gets a bit tedious for large font libraries. Here's
    a [[http://www.designfad.com/random/suitcase.jpg|screenshot]]. Is Font Agent Pro
    something similar? (I've yet to try it out - probably do that this weekend.) For
    me it would be easier to do this if I had a relatively easy way to search for
    those classifications that I wasn't quite sure about. It's easy to classify Helvetica
    or Garamond, but for a lot of faces that I never use it's a little more difficult
    for me.\r\n\r\nAlso, does organizing by foundry allow you to find a font that
    you didn't already know about? It's one thing to look at a project and know what
    font you think would fit and then search by foundry but another if you have no
    idea what you're looking for other than a general thought that it should be a
    serif face."

    \ In all honesty, it's not that spectacular.  You can crudely \"classify\" fonts
    by putting them into secondary \"collections\" in the left-hand sidebar (much
    like making a playlist in itunes).  Problem is that it takes *forever* to go through
    all of the fonts individually and place them manually into a collection.  Not
    to mention the previously addressed problem of not knowing what to classify things
    as.  Currently, I have them classified by sans, serif, serif oldstyle, slab serif,
    handwritten, script, and novelty (which I plan on overhauling soon, as this hasnt
    worked well for me).\r\n\r\nIf Suitcase really has these organizational features,
    im going to have to just buy it already."
