  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve gone through dozens of concepts and after presentation this is the one that came out on top for the client &ndash; almost unanimously.</p>
<p>The client is a high end caterer that mostly caters high-end weddings held in private and public mansions. They wanted to upgrade their identity to reflect the perfect, polished, and remarkable events they cater. They have a lot of name recognition in their geographic area and are also very proud of the personal attention that each event gets from their staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the main &ldquo;Russell Morin&rdquo; type &ndash; I slightly modified a very beautiful typeface and added some elements of the owners signature into it. Though, if you have comments on that, I&rsquo;d love to hear them (I&rsquo;m certainly not a type expert). I&rsquo;m having the most trouble with the treatment/typeface/size of the &ldquo;fine catering&rdquo; tagline. I just can&rsquo;t get it to seem to work in a sophisticated enough fashion. Please help me out!</p>
<p>Thanks a million!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The signature script is nice. However, the R seems a little out of place. Alone, the R doesn&rsquo;t resemble an R, you might want to play with the curve from the top of the R to the bottom of the leg as it extends under the u.</p>
<p>For the tag&hellip; I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re using Copperplate Gothic, which is a nice choice. I&rsquo;d move the tag below the signature, centered and shrink the size to almost half the width of the signature. The space between the signature and the tag should be equal to about 1.5 the tag&rsquo;s size. (So, if the tag was 12 points, the space between the tag and the signature would be 18 points.) Centering it, will also give the signature a nice balancing point.</p>
<p>The color seems very light. If you were to convert that to grey scale, it would probably be equal to 10-15% black, that&rsquo;s too light. Consider bumping up the saturation.</p>
<p>It has a nice look to it, it&rsquo;s really at the tweak stage. I&rsquo;d be interested to see your other iterations before they picked this one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like the R a great deal; it&rsquo;s masculine. I agree that the tag could be darker, but I actually like it aligned right. It balances the curve of the script lettering, and if it&rsquo;s centered, the script may look lopsided.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s very nice work. I worked many years in five diamond catering, and it&rsquo;s refreshing to see a brand without an ornate crest or bow tie. I think the extra touch of sophistication you&rsquo;re looking for may be found in the media - 100% cotton paper and embossed letterpress printing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the great comments everyone!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;R&rdquo; is actually pulled from Russell&rsquo;s (the owner) signature. After reading your comments I want to be sure that it (1) reads as an &ldquo;R&rdquo; and (2) doesn&rsquo;t seem too awkward with the rest of the type treatment.</p>
<p>I agree, aluminum, if you have to say that you are &ldquo;cool&rdquo; then you just aren&rsquo;t. We went through a name change with them and they just couldn&rsquo;t lose the Fine Catering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love some typeface suggestions for the &ldquo;fine catering&rdquo; tagline &ndash; I&rsquo;m okay with the Copperplate but I don&rsquo;t love it and feel like there could be something nicer out there that I&rsquo;m totally overlooking.</p>
<p>How could I have not even considered letterpress for this logo? It was totally off of my radar. Thanks for the suggestion it is really meant for it. I do agree, though &ndash; the strength in the logo is closely tied to how it is held up by the medium&rsquo;s it is printed on and the other surrounding design elements.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re both simple, but have charming letterforms.</p>
<p>I also like Eileen&rsquo;s suggestion for letterpress, but remember this will also be on the side of van&rsquo;s and probably embroidered onto chef&rsquo;s jackets. So it needs to work in a multitude of mediums.</p>

<p>Consider the most elegant restaurants. They don&rsquo;t SAY &lsquo;restaurant&rsquo; on their sign. People just KNOW it&rsquo;s an elegant eatery.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I worked a bit with the stroke weight of the R &ndash; hopefully that will integrate it a bit more.</p>
<p>Can you compare two tagline treatments for me? I&rsquo;m really just splitting hairs, I think. I can&rsquo;t decide: (Copperplate on top Topaz on bottom)</p>
<p>I love the Topaz face &ndash; I was concerned that the shaded font wouldn&rsquo;t read well when the logo was scaled down so I used the background version instead. I think the height of the font will help readability when scaled and if it is scaled really small I&rsquo;ll lose the &ldquo;fine catering&rdquo; tagline. Similarly, though, I am worried that the serif&rsquo;s of Copperplate won&rsquo;t read well when scaled down. Perhaps that was my initial hesitation with Copperplate. Does anyone have a preference?</p>
<p>The script typeface is Cezanne. Really pretty script.</p>

<p>Can you have Russell give you a new signature, using a really big Sharpie? One with a chisel tip, perhaps. Then run it through the photocopier a few times to give it some wear and tear before adding it to the script.  Cezanne has a lot of character and additional R is just flat next to it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At first glance, I preferred the tagline in Copperplate VS Topaz. The characters in Topaz are quite tall, and my first thought was that they were competing with the script above. But I see your concern about readability when it&rsquo;s scaled down. I walked acorss the room at looked at my screen. Topaz was stronger.</p>
<p>I would suggest taking the size of the tagline down a pt or two and increase the tracking; and adding a tiny bit more leading between the name and tag. The stroke design by Jimsbee also has a very classy look.</p>

<p>I never said Jim Henson had a copyright on the use of horizontal strokes. I was just noting the similarity between Jim Hargreaves&rsquo;s mock-up and the existing Jim Henson signature workmark.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My two cents' worth. Have only scanned the comments, so forgive me if I&rsquo;ve repeated anything.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;R&rsquo; and the &lsquo;M&rsquo; look like they come from different &lsquo;hands&rsquo;. The dot on the &lsquo;i&rsquo; is too long for my liking – looks messy. The join between the second &rsquo;s' and the &lsquo;e&rsquo; needs to be smoothened out (feels mechanical). Russell and Morin seem to have a different rhythm going on (the Russell seems less consistent, the Morin has a steady rythem). I know this is a hybrid between Cezanne and a real signature, but it needs a little more refinement to feel like it came from &lsquo;one&rsquo; hand. On the other hand, I liked the first design and its colours. The rectangle to me says &lsquo;table&rsquo; or &lsquo;fine linen&rsquo;. And, though I like Topaz, in this case I prefer the Copperplate – has a little more character and because it is a wide font, acts as a nice support/line (so no line). But, I&rsquo;d modify the &lsquo;G&rsquo; and agree with Asvetic&rsquo;s suggestion re: space between name and the tag.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go for copperplate gothic and such (i mean sackers gothic, blair …) in the tagline. For me it is a little bit like to use Trajan as a default face for movies.
And … a very wide face looks strange, if it&rsquo;s spaced out that much.</p>
<p>I would give Versa Condensed SC a second try, hehe. Why – it looks elegant/distinctive, and you can space out this way condensed styles much better, and a &ldquo;line-feeling&rdquo; you can add with the use of SC.</p>
<p>Yes i agree, the tagline should smaller in size. For a useful logo system, you should design different versions of the logo for different sizes, etc. If the client pays for it …
Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>The major problem I saw was the R, too low and no relation to the M. This aligns it with the M and gives it a similar entry stroke.</p>
<p>The line is another possible solution to that bugaboo.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s Sans monoline is the perfect foil for the signature as it is the opposite of the sig, great contrast.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While the R might be a bit too strong I believe the effort holds together reasonably well. We tend to overwork - logos especially - when it really is not overtly called for. Call it graphic narcissism. That said, a few tweaks and IMHO I think you are there. (I am basing my comments on the original).</p>
<p>Consider tinting the signature just a bit - it comes off too aggressively. I am not in favor of darkening the FINE DINING much. It is more elegant with no more than perhaps a 10 -15% increase. In addition, you might either drop it a bit to let the eye air it out or, as another designer suggested run a rule and drop it centered. As for the rule it should be a hairline or just a bit heavier adding to the classy effect you seek.</p>
