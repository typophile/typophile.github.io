body: "We are using ITC New Baskerville and InDesign for a semi-annual  publication,
  unaware that  this font set  lacked several Greek symbols (e.g., kappa, chi, omega).
  A new ITC New Baskerville Pro version may add a few Greek symbols, but none of those
  mentioned. We can make do with substituting another font, if we have to, but a bigger
  problem arises in translating from an original document in WORD Times Roman to ITC
  New Baskerville in InDesign.  This process leaves no marker specific to the original
  Greek symbol. \r\n\r\nQuestions: \r\n\r\n(1) is there a complete ITC New Baskerville
  font set available that has the key Greek symbols needed for statistics?\r\n\r\n(2a)
  \ If not, Is there some way in In-Design that we can \"program\" a reading of each
  missing symbol into say the Times Roman equivalent - so that almost everything would
  be in ITC Baskerville except for these occasional Greek letters. \r\n\r\n(2b) Better
  still, if there is a way, do you know where we might get Greek letters in the ITC
  new Baskerville font to  add to our current set. \r\n\r\n\r\n(3) If there is no
  solution to suggest to the above,  can you suggest a font that is very close to
  the look of ITC New Baskerville but has a more complete Greek symbol set.\r\n\r\n(4)
  Any other suggestions welcome such as where else to look for a solution.\r\n\r\nThank
  you to anyone who has information.  I am new to the group and apologize if this
  is a routine question. Please point me to the right FAQ section, if so."

    it does show a big pink rectangle? That's InDesign telling you, \"hey I don't
    have that character in this font.\"\r\n\r\nAs for changing your current font,
    or replacing it with one that <em>does</em> contain Greek, I can't help.\r\n\r\nMy
    usual way of inserting otherwise unsupported characters in a document is to create
    a character style that only defines another font that contains Greek to match
    the 'base' font (i.e., sans, serif, small x-height -- or \"whatever\", if nothing
    really matches!), then I locate each of the missing glyphs and assign this character
    style to it.\r\n\r\nIn modern versions of InDesign -- CS4 and newer -- you can
    edit a Preflight profile to warn you for any missing characters. Since large preflight
    profiles tend to make ID unusably slow, even on really really fast systems, I
    created one profile that <em>exclusively</em> checks for missing glyphs."
