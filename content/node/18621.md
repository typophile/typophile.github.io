body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am working on a cool information design project that
  relates the 1906 earthquake refugees to the current Katrina diaspora, in commemoration
  of the 100 year anniversary in SF. I am looking at many different typographic options,
  but am also considering using a face that was actually in use in the west during
  that time. Any help with this endeavor would be most appreciated, most of my work
  is contemporary, so I would love to hear some suggestions from those who are familiar
  with this era. \r\n\r\nI should also mention that this exhibition will be mounted
  in an actual earthquake refugee shack, several of which still exist here in the
  city, orginally designed by SF Park Superintendent John McLaren with the Dept. of
  Lands and Buildings of the San Francisco Relief Foundation, and the US Army. I want
  to avoid the obvious pitfalls that designers like Michael Schwab fall into (using
  Eagle for every project) since this effort predates any WPA project by 30 years.
  \r\n\r\nAnd finally, I am mostly searching for a display face, not for text. This
  exhibition will be on a city sidewalk, so it needs to be not only arresting but
  legible. \r\n\r\nHere is some more information if you are interested. This is the
  ugliest site but these are the folks who are paying for the exhibition. http://www.outsidelands.org/sw17.php\r\n\r\nThanks."

    etc? Anyway having just completed my 6 month stay in this beautiful city I would
    be happy to contribute with any of my typefaces, depending if you find any fit
    for this project? If so please contact me and I will try to assist you. \r\n\r\nP.S.
    I visited the exebition at SF MOMA earlier in January, and was deeply affected
    by the devestation made to the city in 1906.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
