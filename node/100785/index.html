If the font is set to no-embedding then you might want to contact Apple. If it is embeddable you probably want to check with Adobe. It's possible that there's something about the font that InDesign's PDF export doesn't like. Does it work with other TTCs?

Tom, I think you are right in that Apple has messed up with this one somehow because Font Book definitely says it is embeddable.  It is very strange that you could create a PDF using TextEdit but InDesign refuses to embed it.  I presume Adobe are more wary of copyright infringement and hence check into the metadata more thoroughly?

Oobimichael, I have an early 2012 MacBook Air bought in Malaysia, so it does not seem to be an EU specific issue.  'Black' and 'Bold' are an important part of my document, which is why Adobe's Creative Suit version of the font is not suitable for this project.

In doing some research online, it seems there is an Apple Thai font (Thonburi) that has caused similar problems.

This thread http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2007/11/os-x-105-leopard-fixing-thai.html discusses the font and its problems.

Unfortunately, I am in China and the Government blocks pretty much all blogs, so I cannot read what it says.  :(

Any ideas on where I might be able to source a similar font that can be embedded?

Normally I think the fonts provided by Apple with OS X are always embeddable, so perhaps in this case it is the metadata used by Adobe apps that was not changed as it should have been.

Is there any way for you to use Apple apps like Pages or TextEdit for this project?

I would also suggest searching/asking in the Adobe forums about this problem.  Adobe apps should be able to use these fonts just like Apple apps do.</div>

The thread below cut from a 2009 post by Adove seems to address the issue from Adobe's view point.

I have not used Pages or TextEdit.  My 78 page document is at printing stage when I discovered this issue.  I have substituted the troubled font(s) (bold & black included) just to get this out the door to the printers today.

Thanks again.

35. Dov Isaacs, Nov 16, 2009 12:42 PM   in reply to wvperegrine Report
Jeff,
 
(1)     There was absolutely no change in how InDesign (or any other Adobe application) embeds fonts between CS3 and CS4. In fact, InDesign has been very consistent in terms of what fonts it allows to be embedded in exported PDF files since InDesign 1.0!
 
(2)     There is a signficant difference between having a "licensed font" and a font for which the license permits embedding of the font within an output file such as PDF. Furthermore, there are differences between what the physical font file indicates are embedding restrictions and what may actually be provided in writing in the font's EULA (End User License Agreement). Thus, you may be "licensed" for a font, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your license permits embedding of such a font in another file. Note that these are not as you put it Adobe licensing agreements (see 4 below).
 
(3)     For TrueType and OpenType fonts, there are embedding privilege flags inside the font. These range from the most liberal embedding (allowing installation of such embedded fonts on a "receiving" system) to moderate restriction (editable - allows you to edit documents that have the embedded font) to further restrictive (preview and print - allows you only to display and print documents using the embedded font) to full restriction (no embedding of the font permitted). Adobe applications do honor those embedding privilege flags. Note that Type 1 fonts (in ancient times referred to as "PostScript fonts") do not have such embedding privilege flags and as such, we have no way of knowing the intent of the font supplier. Thus, such fonts are not restricted by Adobe applications in terms of embedding.
 
(4)     Just so that you understand the context of why Adobe abides by the embedding restriction flags inside of TrueType and OpenType fonts, please understand that this wasn't Adobe's effort at protecting Adobe's or anyone else's turf. All fonts that you may license from Adobe have at least "preview and print" embedding privileges; those fonts from Adobe that are of our own design provide the more liberal "editable embedding" privileges. Adobe has been very consistent in urging other font foundries not to put unreasonable barriers to font embedding in PDF files, but we cannot control the business practices of these other foundries. In fact, it was in response to lawsuits against Adobe by some of these other font foundries that we started enforcing embedding restrictions!
 
(5)     If all this isn't bad enough, even if a font does physically permit embedding, what really governs a font's legal status is the EULA. An OpenType or TrueType font may not physically indicate that a font may not be embedded, but if the EULA prohibits embedding, as the licensee you are legally bound to not embed such fonts in a PDF or any other type of file. Furthermore, some EULAs allow embedding, but the license provides that you must pay a royalty fee to the font foundry for each copy of the resultant PDF file that you distribute. Read your EULAs very carefully.
 
(6)     As I and others indicated earlier in this thread, there are indeed fonts distributed with operating systems and other applications that do have licensing restrictions. Sorry, but Adobe can't do anything about that!
 
          - Dov  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed.  Ideally all fonts provided with the OS should be embeddable, as users are not much interested in checking this out whenever they use one.  I think that has probably always been Apple's intention, but they have missed some.
