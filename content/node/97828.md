  body: "I'm so pleased anyone remembers.\r\n\r\nFurioso has a little history. I was
    pursuing my senior project in graphic design at Yale as an undergraduate. I worked
    at the (now gone) University Printing Service and the University Printer, the
    great letterpress designer and printer Roland Hoover, asked me to think about
    Albertus. The previous retired University Printer Greer Allen, a lovely man, had
    know Bertold Wolpe, and I felt I had a bit of an endorsement to do it. I worked
    for months on making and documenting a version of it. I called it Furioso after
    \"Orlando Furioso,\" or \"Roland the Berserker,\" in honor of Mr. Hoover (and
    to avoid trademark issues with Albertus).\r\n\r\nAs a poor post-undergraduate,
    I posted it as shareware (partial font) and eventually made about $500 (minus
    shipping costs) to send the font out to those who wanted the full face. Helped
    a lot in 1990!\r\n\r\nLater, Monotype came out with an authorized version, but
    having studied Wolpe's drawings and many, many specimens, there's is not as authentic
    as mine. It was too regularized. "
