  on my computer. Now, I've seen great fonts that guys have recommended that look
  great in the previews and screenshots. On my computer, however, they look strange
  and awkward (some of them, at least). Take a look at the image. What is wrong? Is
  it clear-type? Do any of you guys get this? Finally, how can I fix it?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lido_4317.GIF]"

  body: This sample shows problems on the vertical axis, but ClearType is currently
    designed to help only on the horizontal axis. It appears that this particular
    font is simply poorly hinted.

  body: "\" ClearType is currently designed to help only on the horizontal axis.\"\r\nNot
    exactly. CT is engineered to give more resolution to the horizontal axis, and
    to use more hints in the vertical axis. \r\n\r\n\"this particular font is simply
    poorly hinted.\" \"I\u2019ve tested un-clear-typing my system and Lido looks the
    same.\"\r\nExactly. CT does not do a good job rendering normal TT fonts unless
    they have dynamite vertical hints and a lack of horizontal complexity in the design
    until around 30-40 pixels per em. And sans normal TT hinted fonts are best...\r\n"

  body: Lido is a text font that was not designed for system-wide display use. Print
    it out on a hi-res laser or inkjet and your opinion of the font will change.

  body: "It's just badly hinted, causing inconsistent x-height at typical screen res.
    Nothing to do with ClearType per se, as the same problem shows up without ClearType
    under Windows.\r\n\r\nTrueType hinting is tricky, mind you. But even with FontLab
    auto-hinting I'd think one should be able to avoid this, as long as various font-wide
    parameters are set correctly.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Or get a higher-resolution screen.\r\n\r\nFor example: My Dell Inspiron 9100
    laptop has a 17\" screen with pixel dimensions of 1920\xD71200. That works out
    to a resolution of 148 pixels per inch; with ClearType enabled it's even higher.
    On that screen, even the worst-hinted fonts don't look half bad.\r\n\r\nThe trick
    is to get a display that can cram the most pixels into the smallest physical display
    area. (Generally speaking, bigger is <em>not</em> better.)"

  body: "My guess is that this font is autohinted in FontLab, and that the alignment
    zones have not been correctly set by the person who made the font, such that,
    for example, the top of the lowercase y is slightly below the bottom of the x-height
    alignment zone, so is not being correctly aligned.\r\n\r\nFontLab autohinting
    works best if you manually set up the alignment zones ahead of time."

    muscles? Very high ppi numbers can backfire in many real-world situations. I have
    the same Dell as you (although it's called E1705) but I intentionally chose the
    1440\xD7900 display: more than just saving the measley $150, I think I'm saving
    a lot on Tylenol.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
