  I am concerned about the job market in New York; I get the impression things in
  New York are extremely competitive, and I\u2019m not sure that <a href=\"http://jpad.biz/design.html\">my
  own work</a> is good enough to get me a job that\u2019s any better than what I already
  have here in DC. On the other hand, what I would learm from grad school in New York
  and be involved with the New York AIGA could be really great for me. \r\n\r\nI am
  also concerned about the intensity of work in New York. I don\u2019t mind working
  hard, but I have limits; when I was younger I worked enough to put myself in a hospital\u2014twice.
  I also need free time to keep working on type design outside of work. So working
  seven days a week at an agency isn\u2019t really an option.\r\n\r\nIs getting hired
  and working in New York as crazy as some people make it out to be? Can I expect
  to find a good 40-hour a week job in New York?"

  body: 40 hours a week is a part-time job. And the AIGA New York only really likes
    wealthy successful designers.

  body: James P., one way to start is to visit some recruitment agencies to see if
    you can get some freelance gigs... It will give you the opportunity to build up
    your portfolio and resume, not to mention gaining some experience... Many agencies
    hire freelancers on an ongoing, long-term basis, or as temp-to-hires. Some weeks
    you will do 35-40 hours, other weeks it will be more, as James M. has said.

    my in-house job here. I like having editors and writers I know and working on
    common themes for long stretches. "

  body: "Yeah you'll be looking at around 60-70 hours a week for sure in most places.
    And rent is outrageous. You'll have to move to Brooklyn or Queens. And it is very
    very competitive. I'm sure there are less intense agencies in the outer limits
    of the city but I think the feeling is people generally go to New York to work
    at the best places and the quality of jobs there reflect that.\r\n\r\nBut New
    York is pretty much the most awesome city in the world."

  body: If you like that environment, you may want to try to crack the editorial design
    world. Lots and lots of magazines are published in the NYC area. Someone is always
    getting fired, so there is usually some good turnover. You may try to get your
    foot in the door doing freelance production layouts. When it comes to closing
    time, most magazines staff up for a week or so to help with the crunch. Most of
    these are filled via the recruitment agencies Ricardo mentions above. If you don't
    have a strong editorial portfolio the freelance production route may be your only
    option to get in.

  body: "James M., I've heard magazine jobs (and book jobs, for that matter) pay less
    than ad or direct mail agencies. Does this apply to freelancers, as well?\r\n\r\nAnd
    Haley, you make good points about the crazy cost of living in the most awesome
    city in the world... (And renting a place just keeps getting more and more expensive.)
    So James P., those are things you have to take into account."

    an issue. I just want to be sure that I can work and still have time for type
    design and trips to the gym. Of course, if I\u2019m really smart I\u2019ll just
    try working somewhere I can do a lot of type and lettering and kill two birds."

  body: "Ricardo, Some mags pay well, other not so good. Consumer vs Trade. Trade
    book staffs are smaller, but tend to pay OK. Staff positions below art director
    on a consumer book are usually fairly low paying, but freelance help generally
    gets reasonable rates, put usually for production rather than layout.  I spent
    most of the 80s working in the magazine business and had a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn
    is quickly becoming too expensive for newcomers to the city, but if James P's
    partner is an attorney that shouldn't be a problem. \r\n\r\nThere are very few
    places in NYC where you will do much type design or lettering unless you work
    for a font development studio. \r\n\r\nWe are not hiring, I don't know about the
    other NYC font folks."

  body: 'James, if you''re concerned about hours, don''t join a studio or ad agency.
    I made that decision at the start of my career and never wavered. And I always
    had time for extras. Your best bet is as design director for a company or major
    non-profit, doing a bit of everything. My last staff position, before going freelance,
    was as art director at the national headquarters of Planned Parenthood, doing
    over 200 jobs of every description yearly, including divisional magazines I designed
    from scratch, two different annual reports, books, brochures, special event stuff--the
    gamut. So if you yourself don''t need to make six figures, non-profit is actually
    more satisfying creatively than many companies. And you can job search right now
    from your computer, including the top design employment agencies. '

  body: "I've never lived in the NYC but I do know how competitive the market there
    is.  Much like Mondo has mentioned, I worked as the creative director at a start-up
    in Atlanta, Ga that blew through it's capital way too fast.  However it was one
    of the most fun rewarding experiences of my life and I've got a tone of portfolio
    work out of it.  My point is, try to find a small, mid-level or a start-up that's
    actually going somewhere.  It's better than being a wage slave with no power or
    input what-so-ever.  Plus in a few years you'll be one of those people who can
    say \"I remember when...\" all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\nhttp://goscreative.com\r\n"
