    download as vector [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo/Pfaff|here]]
    (the one on the sewing machine is probably the left one).\r\nFor the rest and
    as it looks very generic to me, you could try to approximate it using some sans
    like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura/|Futura]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avant+garde|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/zwo|Zwo]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/myself+sans|Museo
    Sans]].\r\n"
