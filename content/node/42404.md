body: "Hi Everyone, I am looking for suggestions for a font that I can use in designing
  a logo for a sports bar.  I am trying not to use any actual sports reference, ie.
  a baseball or basketball.I wanted to get it across with a really great font.  Any
  type of sports theme is fine.\r\nAny suggestions are welcome, I have been searching
  for hours and have not come up with a great one.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: There's some fake Red Sox fonts out there. I'm unsure about legality, but
    on of the less well copied ones might be far enough off to be legally considered
    different.

  body: Unless you're focusing on a particular team, type that speaks generically
    of (American) sports include the thick brush-script cursives (which are mostly
    associated with baseball, though not exclusively) and blocky display types of
    the sort once used for jersey numbers. What are you looking for?

  body: Its  a sports bar for all sports, it has a TV at every booth to watch any
    game and it is in the Philly area.  I used a few of the script fonts and I agree
    they do remind me of baseball.  I tried using the blocky ones as well but didn't
    like the outcome.  The problem I am having is that my design style is more simple
    and clean cut and the guy wants something very loud. So I am trying to balance
    it.  I am also finding it difficult since I can't focus on a specific sport.

    grotesques exist for a reason! If you really can\u2019t come up with anything,
    go to a hockey game, sit in the second row, and then get tanked and heckle the
    refs. That always inspires me."
