  infographic? I guess you can call it an infographic. I think there's just one font
  used. If you click on the image it zooms to a hundred percent. \r\n\r\nMany thanks
  in advance."

  body: Hi Lex, thanks for replying, that's what I thought initially but when I checked
    it the large numerals appear to be different. Isn't there another font being used
    too?

  body: Okay thanks for looking into it for me. It looks like they replaced the numerals
    with a different font then. That would explain why it seemed unusual :)

    they could give (us) the answer."
