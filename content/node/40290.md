  on a photo. I want to make people/object look sunken. I found some very crummy tutorials
  through google. It's not the look I'm going for. \r\n\r\nI want to see the ocean
  bed above (perspective). And particles in the water. Possibly sun rays beaming through.
  \r\n\r\nThanks. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
