  one\u2013this isn't much of a sample, but it's all I've got) for awhile with no
  luck. I found it in \"A Smile in the Mind,\" on a scan of The Lawyer magazine. This
  type was only used for the word \"the,\" so I figured I might as well just crop
  the image to that.  \r\n\r\nAnything else I can contribute, let me know! Thanks
  so much!"
