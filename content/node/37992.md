  with which I can check a font I'm working on in various language settings and which
  shows the exotic characters (foreign languages, Math Characters etc) in real context.
  Probably as everyone else, I'm having a hard time designing and spacing characters
  which I don't know their exact use. \r\nIs there something like this available?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
