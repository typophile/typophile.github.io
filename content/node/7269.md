body: I need an advice. <BR>Is there a way to make quark use st ligatures automatically?
  And also if the ligatures are found in an alternate font is there a way to use them
  automatically in quark, i.e. all instances of st in the text set in typeface X to
  be replaced by st ligatures from typeface X alternate? What I have is a document
  with lots of text and I want to replace all instances of st with a ligature of st
  from the alternate typeface from the same family. <BR>I am using quark 6.1 <BR>
  <BR>In case I can not do this in quark is there a way to do the above things in
  InDesign CS?  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help.

  body: I think too much work and no rest leads to stupid questions:-&#40; Ok, I did
    replace what I needed manually with the find option in Quark but I still need
    to know if ther is an option to do this automatically? Maybe applescript? <BR>
    <BR>TIA

    of st and replace with the character, deselect ignore case and attributes and
    set the font you want. <BR>Tim

  body: There is a command that lets set ligatures automatically. Go into Preferences&#62;character&#62;ligatures
    and check the box. I&#39;ve always done this but on my current copy of Quark its
    not there so I&#39;m having to do it by hand. If you come across this problem
    of no ligature check box can you let me know please?  <BR> <BR>Bec x

    opentype and T1/TT fonts. <BR> <BR>jordan

  body: '&#62;Quark for the PC  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe that the &#39;fi&#39;
    and &#39;fl&#39; ligatures are standard characters in a PC Type 1 font encoding
    -- though they are standard in the Mac encoding. I suppose Quark feels that it&#39;s
    not worth supporting automatic ligature substitution on PC platforms, despite
    the proliferation of OpenType faces that do contain those ligatures -- and many
    more. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s only a guess as I haven&#39;t used XPress in donkey&#39;s
    years. InDesign is my Excedrin -- no more headaches.'

  body: After spending the past week using Quark I have to say I&#39;m quite happy
    to go back to Indesign, it may be full of bloatcode but its much easier to work
    with. Quark is faster on my pc &#40;my powerbook will be here in 3 weeks!!&#41;
    I&#39;ve only had to use it because my typography tutor is a purist and insists
    that we use Quark.

    I&#39;ve recently applied for a position at a place I know only uses Quark. &#42;sigh&#42;

  body: I haven&#39;t tried this personally, but I believe you can edit your font
    in Fontographer and assign the st ligature to a key. That way you can just type
    in the st ligature much as you would type in fi or fl. &#40;I&#39;m working in
    Quark 4 on the mac.&#41; <BR> <BR>--Dan
