body: "I'm trying to find out what the name of this font is, but it is eluding me.
  There are many inline serif's I've found, but none where the serif is so long or
  quite as vertical on the E, also many of the ones I located had a hollow stroke
  on the right side of the A where this one does not.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bake_5702.jpg]\r\n\r\nHelp
  me out guys! Please!"
