  body: 'Where is that sample from? It looks like an old Letraset catalog font(s).
    In general try to give more information about the age and source of the sample.
    An example would be, if you posted a picture of an elephant it would be useful
    to know if it was from Africa or India. '

  body: "Tim, your suggestion of Macrame Super Triline from Blue Vinyl Fonts is pretty
    darn close.\r\n\r\nI had glanced through a few samples I have from Photolettering,
    Inc., VGC and Solotype. All had offered many variants on the Prisma/Prism/Prismatic
    style of multiple inlines, tri-lines, etc.\r\n\r\nNone of them were an EXACT match.\r\n"
