I guess I would need some more info to critique this as a brand identity.  Right now, I am just confused as to what it is all about, but slightly intrigued too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A little context:  This is for a new record label focused around ambient recordings, so it can be a little bit out there, assuming (by nature of the project) that the audience is more design literate than the average bear.  My goal is not instantly recognizable, but hopefully decipherable within 10 seconds. I have it treated on the label a bit differently to where it can only be read while the record is playing.  Quiet transmissions.</p>
<p>It is intended to be progressively spaced out (like the music), and want to make sure that it looks like an even progression.  I also don&rsquo;t want to start too tight on the l-o-v nor get too loose on the d-a-y, which makes the job a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>The reason for the upside-downness: I want the viewer to look up at it.  Like hot metal from heaven.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the idea. Coming back to the question of legible though: either because of, or in spite of the fact that I&rsquo;m a designer, at first I saw the shapes as alien (there&rsquo;s something Arabic about it at first) and so I&rsquo;d be very wary of alienating people&hellip;if there&rsquo;s too much figuring out to do, people give up and feel bad.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I definitely see an alien, arabic form to it, and to me that&rsquo;s its strength!  It&rsquo;s very much like the music, in which familiar sounds become alien, but the harmony of all the elements keep it from alienating the listener (or registering as just plain noise).  I certainly don&rsquo;t want people to feel bad!  I want it to be more of an a-ha! experience that ends positively and leaves the viewer feeling a bit more clued-in.  I&rsquo;m assuming from the viewer a heightened state of visual receptiveness in the same way they need to be open to new sounds as a listener.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also considering how people will be accessing this logo, which will, for the most part be from a spelled-out URL.  So it will be less about <em>what</em> it says and more about <em>how</em> it says what you know it is.</p>
<p>&hellip;and I think we DO have mirrors inside our heads!  We can watch TV sideways and read AMBULANCE when it&rsquo;s flipped&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In the context you are working, I do think that the initial confusion works OK.  I think you actually have too many concepts here.  The tracking increasing from left to right is too subtle, and in my opinion not a very compelling concept.  I do like the idea of meditating to find the text among what initially seems like an unknown script, and I think it could work as if we are looking up at the letters, but I think that could be accomplished without it oriented as if we are looking at the back of the letters.  Hopefully that helps!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i would try to incorporate some ideas that make up ambient music. To me, the music is more about the textures and the synergy that is created when those textures overlay. Though bare in mind, that when I say that, i&rsquo;m thinking of artists such as Jefre Cantu-Ledesma,  Rafael Anton Irrisarri, Deaf Center, Tim Hecker etc.</div>
