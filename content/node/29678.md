  body: I don't think it's based on anything existing, as these shapes are very easy
    to create from scratch, but it does remind me of <em>beta_lounge</em> by <a href="http://beta-bi.de/start.html">beta_bi</a>
    (go to <em>vermischtes > fontlabor > 01)</em>.

    I'm having hardtimes here :(\r\n\r\nDo you perhaps have a link to a tutorial on
    that subject? Is it constructed with a grid behind?\r\n\r\nBeta_lounge is a hit!\r\n\r\nThanks
    to Stephen also."
