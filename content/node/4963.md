body: Hey there. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a body typeface for a magazine that
  i&#39;m designing that will be in tabloid format, and quite packed with content,
  so it needs to be pretty tight. Since it&#39;s aimed at young people, it allso need
  to be a bit modern. <BR> <BR>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated... <BR> <BR>Sv.

    a larger x-height and darker color. <BR> <BR>So guys, what are some fonts like
    that which are a bit &#34;hip&#34;? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    If I had that assignment I would collect all the graphics available for the first
    issue and samples of ads &#40;if applicable&#41; along with scripts of articles
    to run. Then I would sift and sort that hard copy along with the general tone
    of the book and the demographics of the readers. Once you have a feeling for the
    book, you might begin setting some paragraphs and display copy. Perhaps you might
    want to use different typefaces for each article. Look at the publications that
    appeal to you and see what they have done. I don&#39;t think you need to commit
    yourself to a specific face. More important is the layout of the book and how
    to keep the ads from getting in the way of readership. The short answer would
    be KISS -- Keep it Simple Sveinbjorn.
