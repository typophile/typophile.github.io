body: "Discussion of math symbols is all the rage. I happen to be working on the italics
  for a non-math font. Meaning it's not used for setting complex math formulas, but
  for casual usage (inline and tables) it does include designed symbols from the Mac
  Roman math set. The font includes oldstyle, lining, and smallcap numerals in tabular
  and proportional variants with corresponding operators. \r\n\r\nIn the italic, should
  I italicize the math symbols for casual usage defined above? If so, are there ones
  that shouldn't get italicized?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: As a guy with a math degree, I can state with confidence that italic math
    symbols are pretty much useless, and a waste of your time to draw and tweak. For
    all "normal" mathematics, there is no reason to set operator symbols in italic.

  body: "I now slant ALL the math operators in my italic fonts, on the principal that
    these are, as Randy says, non-math fonts.\r\nThat way, if perchance the characters
    are used in italic text -- as, for instance, the plus sign may be in company names
    \"... + Associates\" -- they don't look wrong. Or if a tid-bit such as E=mc\xB2
    is mentioned, then the equals sign looks appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf compositors wish
    to use these fonts for simple equations etc., they will know exactly where they
    stand, and that all the upright operators are in the roman fonts.\r\n\r\nHistorically,
    italic fonts were used with roman figures. Now that italic figures are available,
    why stop there?\r\n"

  body: "Fantastic. I can honestly say there is zero chance this will be used to set
    a math text. Another reason to include them is for opentype equivalency. I'm trying
    to keep all the same features for roman and italic, across all weights. Even though
    Bold Italic Small Caps are probably not the most useful part of the family, it's
    confusing as a users to have different features for different parts of a family.
    So the bold italic small caps get bold italic small cap sensitive tabular math
    operators.\r\n\r\nOpentype is a slippery slope. Thanks guys. -- R"
