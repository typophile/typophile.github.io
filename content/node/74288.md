  an incomplete set that I'm trying to round out. I'm new to sourcing metal type,
  so suggestions on that are also appreciated. Thanks very much."

  body: I would've said Trade Gothic, but especially the N has a completely different
    stress.

  body: Would you guys say the majority of it looks like Trade Gothic Bold Condensed?
    Thanks for your help.
