  identical to the one used for the \"Dutch Masters\" cigar logo? Any help would be
  greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/DutchMasters1024Wallpaper.jpg\r\n\r\n"

    Antiqua</a> look exactly like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_romic_light/\">Romic</a>?\r\n\r\nSchadow
    is a pretty interesting design. Nobody's fonts look quite like Trump's."

    Schadow Antiqua is indeed a font from URW and it looks nothing like Schadow.

  body: I figured it wasn't FontShop's doing. I just thought it was weird (not to
    mention confusing) that URW chose to name it's version of Romic after a completely
    different and unrelated typeface.
