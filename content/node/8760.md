body: Hello, <BR>Does anybody know how fonts are ordered in Quark 6&#39;s font menus
  - specifically the pull-out style menus? It doesn&#39;t seem to follow any specific
  order &#40;at least one that I can see&#41;. <BR> <BR>I know it is possible to arrange
  the order of fonts in InDesign &#40;for good or for bad&#41; with the weight values.
  Can something like this be done in Quark on a Mac?
