body: "<strong>Hi Typophiles</strong>\r\n\r\nI want to set a standard of encoding
  for my typefaces. I know there are loads of encodings, I've been studing some of
  them. The question is... <strong>What do you think a Basic font should have? and
  what about Pro and Expert?</strong> Should they also include Greek and Cyrillic,
  or they should be apart? (allways talking about text fonts, serif/sans) Any info
  about this would be highly apreciated. \r\n\r\nRight now What I thought was:\r\n\r\n<strong>Basic
  </strong> (already made the encoding if you want to look at it/use it is <a href=\"http://ferfolio.com/files/tipografia/Ferfolio-latinExt.enc\"><strong>\"Here\"</strong></a>)\r\n-
  Latin Basic adobe level 3 (+-429 signs). Language support: Danish, Dutch, English,
  Finnish, French, Gaelic, German, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian,
  Portuguese, Sami, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Croatian (Latin), Czech, Estonian,
  Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian (Latin), Slovak, Slovenian
  and Turkish.\r\n- Standard Ligatures\r\n- 4 Number set\r\n\r\n<strong>Pro</strong>\r\n-
  All of the Basic features and lenguages\r\n- Cyrillic?\r\n- Greek?\r\n- SmallCaps\r\n\r\n<strong>Expert</strong>\r\n-
  All of the Basic and Pro features and lenguages\r\n- More lenguages (not sure which
  yet)\r\n- Alternates\r\n- More Standard Ligatures\r\n- Discrecionary Ligatures\r\n-
  Sub/Superscript\r\n- All currency signs (all 45)\r\n- Swashes (if it's pertinent
  for the font)\r\n- Dingbats and Simbol (if it's pertinent for the font)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne
  thing that is not fair... is that the Pro version would be more expensive... and
  people who want to use Cyrillicor Greek would have to pay more... maybe it would
  be prudent to create a Basic Greek/Cyrillic...\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Hrant,\r\n\r\nNow, sometimes you design a typeface for Latin and you
    start selling it... let's say v\xEDa myfonts.\r\nAfter a few months you decide
    to design the Cyrilic/Greek characters. What do you do? Do you create a new version
    that has greek/cyrilic and sell them separately? or just update the font you already
    have in MyFonts? Should it be more expensive?"

  body: "@Hrant:<em> To me writing system support should not be related to Basic/Pro/etc.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    would like to agree, but if one is publishing Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic versions
    of a typeface, the standard practice is to not label the Latin as such, eg:\r\n\r\nPentimento\r\nPentimento
    Greek\r\nPentimento Cyrillic\r\nPentimento PE (Pan-European)\r\n\r\nIf I named
    a font \u201CPentimento Latin\u201D, those in my primary (99%) market (Latin)
    would be perplexed and put off licensing it, because most people think \u201CLatin\u201D
    refers to the ancient language, not the present day writing system.\r\n\r\nSo
    I presently favor the above system, with \u201CPro\u201D describing fonts with
    OpenType features.\r\n\r\nBTW, check how foundries such as TypeTogether, Rosetta,
    Parachute do this -- as well as companies such as Adobe, Microsoft, Apple and
    Linotype -- and of course FontFont, who really upset the apple cart.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just a historical quibble: \"Expert\" came from the PostScript Type 1 days,
    where encoding was by PostScript name, not Unicode. And given the hard-wired encoding
    of Mac & Windows, the so-called \"expert sets\" of the time had most characters
    mis-encoded (i.e., mis-named).\r\n\r\nTo this day, when I see a font advertised
    as having \"expert\" characters, I just assume it's screwed up. You might not
    want to have \"expert\" and \"encoding\" in the same blurb/sentence."

  body: "I concur with the mal-use of \"Expert\". This used to be an indicator that
    the font contained Small Caps, Oldstyle Numerals, and a smattering of ligatures.
    In those days only \"fi\" and \"fl\" appeared in 'normal' fonts; the rest had
    to be replaced manually. A tedious and error prone process (so the term \"Expert\"
    may not have designated the <em>font</em>, but rather the level of experience
    needed to use it correctly).\r\n\r\nThese days, I expect these extras in what
    has become known as \"Pro\" fonts. Adobe makes a clear distinction: its Type 1
    fonts that were converted to the OTF format, but did not magically gain (lots
    of) ligatures or other OT features, are called \"Std\". Those that do -- irrespective
    of the number of scripts --, are called \"Pro\"."

  body: "<cite>I wouldn't call them screwed up except from a usage standpoint<cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    know, actually, they were. Standard PostScript was set up by Adobe, and Adobe
    had a glyph list of proper names for all characters. Not as useful as Unicode's
    numbers, perhaps, but at least a Standard.\r\n\r\nBut if you remember, the OS
    systems for Windows and Mac had a hard-wired encoding, so to get a character that
    wasn't in *their* (different) list,  you had to give it the wrong name. Those
    of us who set type out of a DOS box weren't so limited, but we were few.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you start lying about encodings, everything becomes font-dependent. Sad thing
    is about half the presses we work for today still think that way, and some still
    stick to their old Type 1 fonts with mal-named  characters. Just how many ways
    can you lie about what Greek character goes where, about which font had an omacron
    character in the odieresis slot (so the damn *characters* would change if you
    changed fonts...)\r\n\r\nI call it screwed up, and if we're talking about *fonts*
    rather than *typefaces* I think relevant.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nTo address the original
    question (malformed or no), I think Nick is about right. These days, languages
    covered is the big question, the goodies are just assumed, and can be shown as
    cute little OT icons where the font is sold."
