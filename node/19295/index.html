<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I was going to add a new entry to the <a href=http://typophile.com/node/12063>Typophile Beta Bug Report</a>, however, since this isn't really a bug but rather a request for a new feature, I decided to start a new thread. Hopefully others will add some more ideas, and we'll all make our beloved Typophile even better.
Here's mine:
Is it possible to add a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink>permalink</a> to each post so that they can be referred directly within the thread? I know it's already possible to do something like this http://typophile.com/node/17011#comment-103291 but not everyone knows about it. In addition, one needs to loggin (or dig through the source code) to get the comment number. Thank you :^)
(BTW, I noticed that this 'technique' doesn't work for threads with more than one page.)
[Edit: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/comments/gettingstartedwithajax?page=3#23">A List Apart</a> does this too. Notice how the page number is included. I see now that we could do http://typophile.com/node/17011?from=50&comments_per_page=50#comment-105491 but this is human-unreadable.]</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Sorry, one more thing. Could the URL of the new page(s) be a little more user-friendly? Something like:
http://typophile.com/node/17011?page=2 instead of
http://typophile.com/node/17011?from=50&comments_per_page=50

(<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/comments/gettingstartedwithajax/?page=2">A List Apart</a> does it)
Thanks again!</div>

<div class=commentbody>One thing that bugs me is how, when a topic extends to multiple pages, the "new" flags get wiped out before you can get to the last page of the topic. My workaround has been to add "?from=0&comments_per_page=500" to the link url so all the threads appear on the first (and only) page.
Related to this, I would like the topic page links (e.g., "1 2 3 ... next page last page") to appear both at the top and bottom of topic pages. This would be especially helpful when there are lots of images to load on a page. For example, the only way to get to, say, page 3 of a topic is to got to page 1 first, then jump to the end of the page and click on "3". But if page 1 has a lot of images, the bottom of the page keeps jumping down as the images load making it hard to hit that "3". My workaround is to stop the page loading (leaving out any images that were loading). It's tricky to time it right--if I do it too soon, I may stop it before the bottom of the page has loaded. If the page links were also at the top, it would be much simpler.
Just my 2¢.</div>

Great idea.
>I would like the topic page links (e.g., “1 2 3 … next page last page”) to appear both at the top and bottom of topic pages.
I made same suggestion at the launching of the 'beta', so I second that.
>I’d love to have the forums linked in the gutter on the right hand side so I can access them from anywhere.
I don't know how practical that is because of the scrolling. But you could put them at the top easily enough I would think--as I suggested at the launch--and the bottom as well, I would think. I believe the old version of typophile had this. Right now I have worked around the problem by dragging all the forum links to my browser bar. </div>

<div class=commentbody>In case anyone else uses <a href=http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/>Greasemonkey</a> for the Firefox browser, I've uploaded a script that adds a forum menu to the right-hand side of every page.
You can get it here: <a href=http://times-new-roman.com/dreamless/typophile-menu.user.js>typophile-menu.user.js</a>.

<div class=commentbody>I took these out of the bug report:
I agree with Mark; Could the link for going to the last page of a hot topic also be at the top, so that to check new posts at the end of the second page you don’t have to scroll down. This would be especially useful for hot topics.
It is starting to seem to me that it would be good if the next release made the “Insert image” link about 5 times larger and have blinking arrows all around it. Maybe have them cycle through the spectrum with each blink. I think that would look pretty cool too.
I wonder if there is anyway the comment posting box could have spellcheck?

<div class=commentbody>Another suggestion: If someone screws up an /cite, currently it now makes all following posts in that topic italic in spite of any new html. Is there a way to disconnected the commands from post to post?
For instance: http://typophile.com/node/19850 The /cite was not inserted by Fisheye...</div>

Really agree that all the forums should be listed in the nav, either at the top or the right - it doesn't matter.
And that the links to multiple pages of a long thread should be at the top as well as the bottom.</div>
