  currently have an older version of an Adobe Font Collection (not Font Folio) licensed
  and installed on all 70 machines in the labs. I am looking to represent the major
  type classifications however I need a strong focus on workhorse serifs and san serifs.
  \r\n\r\nSo, if you had to build your ideal font library, what would you want to
  see in it? (I do know some fonts I want to remove like papyrus, herculanum and comic
  sans.)\r\n\r\nThoughts?"
