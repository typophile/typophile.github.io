  -- shouldn't be too hard to find something good, typographic wise, to point him
  in the right direction, or so I thought. I have yet to find something. But maybe
  you guys can help me with some free online-found-examples, preferably as .pdf? Your
  help is as always very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJochen"

  body: "Hallo Jochen,\r\n\r\nHmm, I've recently set an abstractbook for a congress,
    but don't know if that's really pertinent to your question (it was very simple,
    just abstracts, no images etc.)? A couple of pages can be found <a href=\"http://sehsucht.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/zeit-bilder/\">here</a>
    (scroll down a little) as jpegs. If you're interested, I can send you a pdf, although
    I probably won't be able to upload the whole thing, copyright wise.\r\n\r\nAs
    an additional suggestion, do try asking on the German <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/index.php\">Typoforum
    at typografie.info</a>. There are a few regulars there who do scientific stuff,
    so you may well be able to get some valuable input there as well.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck,\r\nNina"

    might need an account to view these.\r\n\r\nFrom what I see, Times New Roman is
    almost universal. Nearly everything will look like this: http://www.filedropper.com/b601996j\r\n\r\nCRC
    handbook uses Warnock and Helvetica condensed and looks OK\r\nhttp://www.hbcpnetbase.com/

    journal that was well designed. I used it myself in a project that involved pollution
    statistics and sourcing that information. \r\n\r\nIt has a bit of an industrial
    feel to it. If you want to see my project with that font in use, look at the postcard
    backs here:   http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_set.asp?from_url=true&sort_by=1&set_id=198255&individual_id=212054\r\n\r\n"
