  body: "Much the same as most of my fonts begin pencil or marker and doodling letters
    on a page. I drew the A, liked it, then the rest followed suit.\r\n\r\nI still
    need to do the punctuation and accented charaters (if at all). The kerning/spacing
    still has work to be done.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've posted some text to show how it looks. Obviously it doesn't read to well
    without punctuation.
