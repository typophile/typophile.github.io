body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clip_5519.png]\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nClip is
  a display typeface inspired by the shape of a paperclip, but it\u2019s not designed
  with the usual minimalistic modular approach. Instead, Clip mimics the construction,
  proportions and contrast of classic bold text typefaces and has one unique characteristic:
  each of its characters is drawn with only one single line.\r\n\r\nClip family consists
  of 3 fonts, Hair, Light and Regular, each with 745 glyphs (supporting more than
  70 latin based languages), 4 stylistic sets and advanced OpenType features. When
  Stylistic set 1 is activated, the overlapping loops contract, giving the text a
  whole new character. Moreover, every uppercase character is also available in an
  ornamental swash variant, which means most of the capitals have four different versions.\r\n\r\nGet
  some extra details [[http://www.urtd.net/clip|here]]."
