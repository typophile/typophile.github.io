  body: "I wrote a rounded corners Python script for my [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/Masnine|Mashine
    Rounded]] but that only accepts straight polygons as an input so it probably wouldn't
    help you much.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/user/8183|Georg Seifert]] showed
    me a rounded corners script he has written for FontLab. It is really sophisticated:
    it gives obtuse angles a greater curve radius in order to make it visually consistent!\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you can convince him to share it, it is probably better than anything else out
    there.\r\n\r\n"

    it does make proportional corners, it even handles curve to curve segments.'

    and then you used Superpolator to help find Spiekermann the \"right\" amount of
    rounding, i.e. the optimal instances between fully straight and fully round? \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nErik asked me a while ago for some scripts to \"turn\" corners
    into round ones.\r\nI wrote a stand alone app to convert UFO's to rounded UFO's
    see ( http://www.typemytype.com/scripting/roundingufo/ )\r\nand next to that i
    wrote also a FL script that does the same thing because its the same code :).
    It can add rounding to the whole font or just to one point in a  glyph (short
    movie: http://www.vimeo.com/704368 ) \r\n\r\nthe input can be a corner with straight
    lines aswell as a combination with curves or just only curves. \r\n\r\nThe parameters
    are the radius of the rounding and where you want rounding: in the black or white
    corners\r\n\r\nErik used the standalone UFOrounding app for the round corners
    and superpolator for the interpolations :)\r\nFor the standalone app i also added
    inktraps because its basically the same thing: adding rounding or inktraps :)\r\n\r\ngr\r\nFrederik"

  body: "When looking through Hrant's proposal for an ink trap formula, [[http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html|The
    Trapping Flower]], I too realized It could also be adapted to rounding corners
    as well (and further that the \"flower\" need not necessarily be circular). Of
    course, not being a programmer, I have no idea as to how to automate this method.\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious as to how you did it, Frederik, and if your app could be adapted to run
    with FontForge, either as a Python script internally or as a post-process on .sfd
    files."

  body: "I just released a python rounded corner script for FontLab yesterday at [[http://betatype.com]].
    It's very nuts and bolts, but it allows a user to select the points he/she wants
    rounded, configure x and y radius, as well as the length of the bezier handles,
    influencing the steepness of the curve. \r\n\r\nIt definitely isn't designed to
    be automatic where you can point it at a whole font and expect some magic new
    design to come out of it. That never works anyway. You really need to pick the
    corners that need to be rounded, and by how much."
