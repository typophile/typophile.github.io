  body: Thanks, Bojev. Things are slightly different in Europe. Anything high-end
    with a sense of understatement has a chance of being branded with Gill Sans. The
    question is, how would you describe the context you consider most appropriate
    for Gill.

    works wherever it works, which in my opinion isn't that often (never been a big
    fan of Gill Sans).

    always considered Gill Sans one of those classic sans, on a par with Futura. \r\n\r\nI
    just helped someone on the Font ID forum with a Futura identification, and he
    felt foolish (when he shouldn't have) for not recognizing it himself. But it had
    been used so elegantly, it seemed more up-to-date than something designed in the
    late 1920s/early 1930s. \r\n\r\nI feel the same way about Gill Sans. Use it thoughtfully
    and well, and it can seem timeless. Its geometry does seem to lend itself, however,
    to products or services meant to evoke precision, craftsmanship, and/or style.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I am tired of seeing, however, are \"fashion\" versions of Didot/Bodoni. Enough
    already."

    Britain for anyone except typophiles. \r\n\r\nI still like and use Gill Sans,
    but might just be a habit formed in the early years of desktop publishing. There
    were few widely-available sans serifs then, and they tended to be either monotonous
    and sterile (Helvetica, Univers) or monotonous and mechanical (Futura, Avant Garde).
    The only sans serifs that were easy to find and looked like the work of a living,
    red-blooded human were Gill Sans and Optima. Optima was a little precious, so
    we used Gill Sans because it looked good, it worked well, and it was just eccentric
    enough to keep from being boring."

    specific contexts but it's very easy to use it inappropriately. I think I might

    are used I feel Gill Sans is so prolific you really have to be careful in how
    you use it.\r\n\r\nInitially I greatly disliked Gill Sans and I actually learned
    to love it. I suspect the initial dislike came from the over-expressive letter
    forms which look amazing in some contexts and horrendous in others. In the Netherlands
    Gill Sans is probably most prolific when it comes to this toy store called Bart
    Smit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/timthumb_6291.jpg]\r\n\r\nI think
    this is one of the ugliest logos I've ever seen and I'm greatly annoyed every

    certain shapes in the lowercase. It's wrong, but in a good way. However that doesn't
    count for every letter. There are several inconsistencies I still don't understand.
    By the way, I never noticed that /b in the 4th weight before. I will have to add
    that to the list of inconsistencies I don't understand.\r\n\r\nCory, is there
    a wonky typeface in the vein of Gill Sans you do like, or is it the wonkiness
    you don't like?\r\n\r\nPS: Why is 'wonkiness' not a word? And what about 'decorational'?

    don't recall ever having used it.\r\n\r\nOf course I could say the same thing
    about most typefaces with distinct personalities \u2014 they're useful mainly
    when their personalities fit the task at hand. Unlike most typefaces, however,
    Gill Sans enjoys the kind of widespread use most often associated with broader-purpose,
    more generic typefaces that tend to take on the qualities of their surroundings.
    It's puzzling to me why Gill Sans is used so often in instances where its personality
    doesn't complement the context in which its used \u2014 the Bart Smit logotype
    being a good example."
