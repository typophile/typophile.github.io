body: "I'm currently working on a font and I've found an issue which baffles me, shown
  here: [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy_glitch.png]]. As you
  can see there are these out of place lines over the \"u\" and \"y\" glyphs, and
  they're not the only affected glyphs. The issue crops up in Photoshop when the font
  is displayed at small sizes or has anti-aliasing off. What's weird is that the lines
  don't actually exist on the vectors, FontLab renders them appropriately and there's
  nothing suspect on the offending glyphs which sets them appart from the others that
  render properly.\r\n\r\nHelp would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDomenico."

  body: I suspect that you never disabled automatic glyph hinting and that Photoshop
    does not like whatever hints FontLab came up with. Try deleting all of the hints
    in the fonts and turn off the automatic hinting options in Fontlab preferences,
    then generate a new font.

  body: It has nothing to do with hinting. It is poor node placement as caused by
    auto tracing. turn on the font audit too in fontlab and get rid of all of the
    bad and excessive nodes.

  body: "Thank you all for the replies.\r\n\r\n@ James: I disabled automatic glyph
    hinting and generated an OT PostScript font to no avail.\r\n\r\n@ Richard: Illustrator
    does create some poorly placed and voluminous amounts of nodes but it's the only
    way to achieve the desired brush effect. FontAudit was unable to find any problems.\r\n\r\n@
    Thomas: The paths are a little awkward but nothing like this has cropped up in
    my past experiences with more complicated paths.\r\n\r\nI found that saving the
    font as OT TrueType solves the problem, irregardless of whether auto hinting was
    set on or off [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy_glitch_2.png]].
    Because my technical knowledge is a little bleak and you're the experts, what
    fixed the problem by changing formats?"

    why I'm hoping someone can impart what saving as TrueType may have done differently.
    \r\n\r\nDon't worry I'm still looking at the nodes, although I don't know what
    I'm looking for; as I mentioned above \"there\u2019s nothing suspect on the offending
    glyphs which sets them appart from the others that render properly\".\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the pick-up on the spacing, although the font is far from completion;
    I still need to create more glyphs, and metrics and kerning won't be touched until
    I can definitively find what's wrong.\r\n"

    like disappearing glyphs and for example an '\xE0' without the hole, but a perfect
    'a'. I don't know if there is a maximum OTF-fontsize, but in CS applications there
    seems to be a maximum fontsize when you use subroutines to compress the outlines
    (with FontLab). The problem described above didn't occur in Quark and also didn't
    happen when I made the font into an OpenType TT. "

    was responsible for the rendering issues seen in the original post.\r\n\r\nI wasn't
    saying the *complexity* of the paths was a problem, but having an extremely acute
    angle in the outline can definitely create the kinds of \"spikes\" you are seeing
    in that screen shot. I remember the first time I saw what looks to me like the
    same problem, during development of Chameleon fonts for PostScript 3 printer ROMs....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "@ Micha: When it comes to re-installing fonts I always make sure to delete
    the installed files, restart the system (if necessary, when some files don't delete)
    and install. I also tried the OTF font without subroutines on an Windows XP system
    that has never seen the file before and still the same issue [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy_screenshot_2.png]].\r\nThe
    OTF font file without subroutines is 164KB and the OTF font file with subroutines
    is 152KB.\r\n\r\n@ Richard: You're hilarious.\r\nI'll give you one glyph for $0
    and you can fix it without removing detail from it. I'll keep the $100 to buy
    a pretty badge for my Typophile avatar.\r\nOK jokes aside, I'm reluctant to remove
    nodes because I don't want to sacrifice detail and because the font as is, shows
    no artefacts when saved in TrueType. Because you insist, I'll pick at the glyphs
    and see how much needs to be changed to get it rendering properly, if there's
    too much detail lost I'll move on or stick with the (as Andreas put it) \"quick
    and dirty\" TrueType solution.\r\n\r\n@ Thomas: Subroutinisation isn't the problem
    as the lines still crop up irregardless of whether the outlines are non-compressed
    or compressed as shown in the screenshots. I'll be on a particular lookout for
    sharp angles.\r\n\r\n@ All: Thanks for the help, it's much appreciated."
