  reference which has, in his words, \"a sense of humor, some sort of childish style
  and a little bit of comic taste; may be even like a carnival and Ottoman flavor,
  such as the curves of a tulip flower, a little bit of brush stroke weight and stress.\"\r\nI
  attach the sample/example he gave to me (would be nice if you can ID this font as
  well).\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/duraga_3841.gif]"

    Espinoza's [[http://www.re-type.com/fonts/tomate.html|Tomate]].
