body: Hi <BR> <BR>I am trying to use a font in Photoshop PS, typing in a circle.  I
  want a fairly plain and wide font, like  MicrogammaDMedext.  However, when i do
  this and type the url the font looks odd, with the w&#39;s in www going skwiffy.  See
  this gif for what i mean... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/40757.gif"
  alt=""> <BR>How can i fix that, or can someone suggest another font which will &#39;curve&#39;
  properly? <BR> <BR>All help appreciated <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: do you want the type itself to curve? Illy CS has a warp feature that would
    work. You don&#39;t have to turn the type to paths, so after you get the curve
    you desire you can then condense the type a bit &#40;cause it stretches it&#41;.

  body: You should always carefully track type on a curve,  <BR>and check all individual
    kerning pairs, as being  <BR>along a curve messes up the negative spaces  <BR>between
    the characters. This is something that  <BR>requires extra time and attention.
    <BR> <BR>The fact that Microgramma has very wide characters  <BR>makes it less
    suitable for setting on a curve, as  <BR>the curve visually breaks up in small
    straight bits. <BR> <BR>Tiff, &#34;warp feature&#34;. Ugh, Idonnoaboutthat...

  body: 5{re are two factors affecting this. <BR>Firstly, the characters are positioned
    on the path according to their base point, which is on the charcter&#39;s baseline,
    at the left of the character. So on a perfect circle, they would &#34;step&#34;
    as in your example. <BR>Secondly, how perfect is the curve they are on? <BR>You
    may have more control if you create the path and type in Illustrator &#40;and
    nudge the path to get the type nice&#41;, and then drag the graphic into Photoshop
    &#40;I think you have to hold down the option, or perhaps the command key&#41;.

    know what you mean above - if anyone has idiot proof instructions on what i should
    do i might have a try! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: yes, yvesie, i know that out of the can that filter could be dangerous. however
    with a little finesse and attention to detail i don&#39;t think it is that bad.
    i mean, really, it is type on a path. <BR> <BR>=D <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/40788.jpg"

  body: If you are serious about setting type on a curve you do it with Illustrator&#39;s
    &#40;10.0x and above&#41; &#34;envelope distort&#34; tool. Under Object &#62;
    Envelope Distort &#62; Make with warp. &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
    beautiful type on a curve. Makes you look like a professional letterer and stuff.

    The top one got a little bit distorted &#40;around tha &#34;and&#34;&#41; but
    nothing that a couple of hours of work can&#39;t fix. And the spacing of &#34;AND&#34;
    on the bottom one is off too, but these are just the initial comps. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Dogmatic, moi? haha! A girl is allowed to change her mind. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    add that most of filters of this variety, used without finesse, will result in
    work that looks canned. But just like any other tool, if you learn how to use
    it properly it can become another tool in your own personal arsenal.

  body: Open up PhotoShop help and search for ARC ... this will give you all the info
    you need. The key is to first type the words onto a path and then follow the instructions
    from your search.

  body: I guess I&#39;ll have to give the warp tool a tryout. <BR> <BR>For doing type
    on a path, the one tip I can give &#40;which may help in Photoshop, though if
    I&#39;m doing type on a path I only use Illustrator&#41; is to adjust the type
    baseline &#40;usually lower&#41;, so that the path runs through the middle of
    the cap height as opposed to along the baseline of the letter -- this will lead
    to a better hug on the curve, I thnk.
