body: "Hello,\r\nI am in need of some advice. I am working on a project with an architect
  firm on the renovation of an evangelic building complex in the center of Budapest.
  On the facade there's going to be a list of the the shops, museums..ect that are
  housed inside the building. The complex as a whole is getting a logo, which will
  also appear on the facade, albeit quite subtly, and it will have an internal wayfinding
  system that will need type as well. There are a long row of shutters that will have
  quotations on them, for what I already picked out [[https://ourtype.com/#/try/loading/undefined/|Bery
  roman]] from Ourtype. The stencil lettering on the shutters and the display type
  above are quite different in scale, i don't think they can be perceived at the same
  time so they don't necessarily need to match, but ideally it would be good if they
  did. \r\n\r\nSo, I need to find a typeface that is good for both big display and
  for the logo and also for the internal wayfinding. Also it need to be something
  that is reasonable priced and can be brought separately, by weight. I really like
  Johnston but it doesn't have enough weights for the logo, and its classical propotions
  don't match Bery's.\r\nThanks in advance for any help you can give.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMGP8001_5639.jpg]"

  body: A better link for Bery Roman would be nice. A link for Johnston would be nice.
    I do not exactly understand the physical relationship of the display type and
    the stencil. And where is the way-finding information? On separate signs or what?

  body: "Cool project. I think Bery Roman does nicely match that fa\xE7ade.\r\n\r\nBut:
    you will need different fonts for the display and the wayfinding. Since Bery is
    a essentially a Didone, I think the main challenge will be finding a font in that
    genre that's suitable for wayfinding.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Egyptian</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/figgins-sans/\">Figgins
    Sans</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/\">Monotype
    Grotesque</a> is also worth considering.\r\n\r\nThese typefaces reject the smooth
    mechanical \uFB01nish of 20th century modernism, and this, in my opinion, is essential
    in respecting the ethos of historical architecture\u2014and not setting up a distracting
    historiographic dialectic between building and typography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Bery Roman is a Didone, a very high contrast serif. Johnston is very low
    contrast sans-serif and does not harmonize at all with Bery Roman. If you do want
    a sans serif you might consider a sans with high degree of stroke contrast, but
    with letter-forms that are still legible enough for way-finding. Myfonts has over
    a hundred stressed sans fonts http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22stressed+sans%22/fonts/
    that you might want to skim through to see how they feel to you when paired with
    Bery Roman. Clearly you don't want your choice to look too modern modern, quirky
    or overused. This counts against fonts such as Optima, Peignot and Parisian. Consider
    something less distinctive, such as Seaside http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/seaside/
    Ocean Sans http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/ocean-sans-mt/ Castle http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/castle-lt/
    or EF Radiant http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/radiant/ \r\nDon"
