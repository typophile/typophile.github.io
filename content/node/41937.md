body: "First post so if this is in the wrong place i apologize in advance.\r\n\r\nI
  have always been interested in trying to understand ways of communicating via Typeface.
  I dont just mean what the letters spell or represent but showing a bigger picture
  through just letters.\r\n\r\nFor instance many fonts used for Business's are straight
  forward,blank and to the point. Nothing fancy. Where as others depend upon somthing
  to stand out and catch the eye of the public. Now to my understanding this can be
  achieved through many ways. Colour,Placement,Size also the font itself.\r\n\r\nBut
  what im asking is to you. \"The others\" of my kind.\r\nWhen you see a typeface
  on a anything, any sort of product how does that particuler font represnt the product/company.\r\n\r\nSorry
  if this is confusing also im trying to gain as much knowledge of the Design Industry
  as possible to further my career.\r\n\r\nJack."

  body: "You had some of your answers in your questions. \r\n\r\n> many fonts used
    for Business\u2019s are straight forward, blank and to the point. Nothing fancy\r\n\r\nThat
    is because their goal is to communicate.\r\n\r\n> Where as others depend upon
    something to stand out and catch the eye of the public.\r\n\r\nAnd these uses
    are trying to attract attention. Normally this will only be a heading, or a few
    words. Many of this type of font would be difficult to read if an entire book
    was printed in them. The features that make them stand out usually lessen their
    ability to communicate.\r\n\r\nAnother type of font is less flashy, but might
    convey other moods. Comic Sans (for those who do not hate it) is considered less
    formal, and provides a more casual feel. An ornate script face is more dignified
    and a Blackletter is even more so. The former gets a lot of use with wedding invitations,
    and the latter is used in funeral cars and some newspaper nameplates (New York
    and London Times, for instance). And when you get good at it, you will start to
    develop a feel for other fonts, and what uses they might be nice for."
