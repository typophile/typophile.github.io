body: Does anyone know what the difference is between a number sign (# - Unicode 0023)
  and a sharp sign (Unicode 266F)? I've found references to the two symbols being
  similar but slightly different, but I haven't found a font that actually has a sharp
  sign.

    sharp</a> that one sees on sheet music. You\u2019ll probably only see it in fonts
    made to use with music software."

  body: "Thanks, James. That Wikipedia article answered my question (I knew it was
    a musical sharp, but I wasn't sure how it differed physically from a number sign).
    Looking at the Wikipedia article, it looks like the number sign has two horizontal
    lines and two angled lines, while the sharp sign has two vertical lines and two
    angled lines.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty surprised more fonts don't include the sharp sign,
    actually. It seems one of the musical notations that is common enough (even outside
    of the musical context) to warrant inclusion."

    most transcription is done using software that includes the fonts. And like math
    fonts, there are also good free or very inexpensive music fonts out there, which
    doesn\u2019t leave much of a commercial market open."

  body: "As with any other character, you can't absolutely define how a sharp should
    look, but it will always have these characteristics: the two horizontal lines
    are slanted upwards (they would straddle the stave lines if preceding a note which
    is in a stave space, otherwise they would fall between two stave lines); the two
    vertical lines are not slanted, and the rightmost of the two is slightly higher
    (matching the slant of the vertical lines); also the vertical lines are thin whereas
    the horizontal lines are thickened. The space between the vertical lines should
    also be less than that between the horizontal lines, somewhat.\r\n\r\nIf designing
    a sharp for a font especially for use in music (and most such fonts are really
    awful) then there would be other things to take into account, such as how long
    the verticals should be. (I realise, of course, that this doesn't really answer
    your primary question of how it differs from a #, but you have that answer already)
    :)"

  body: "Sharp and flat are actually the most likely music symbols to be seen in with
    text, as they can go with the letter names of notes.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I will
    never understand why \"sharp\" has the symbol that looks like a planar grid while
    \"flat\" has the symbol that looks like a pointy little spear."

  body: "The sharp and flat can be useful in texts that make reference to works of
    classical music. Most often the key signature is spelled out completely. Some
    styles will prefer to employ the symbolic abbreviation. \r\n\r\nIn casual use,
    the number sign can stand in for the sharp. Less convincingly, the lowercase b
    has been pressed into service in place of the flat -- e.g., Concerto for Horn
    and Orchestra No. 3 in Eb major, K. 447.\r\n\r\nI've been considering including
    the sharp and flat in the OT version of Whitman, as well as other designs in progress.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Kent, better include the natural symbol as well.\r\n\r\nTake a look at <cite>Bach
    Perspectives</cite> Vol. 1, or some of the Yale Broadway series titles. <cite>Bach
    Perspectives</cite> is a pretty good source for how far a text aimed at an academic
    (but still general) musical audience can go.\r\n\r\n[Boy, that's a rough sentence.
    I mean that the <cite>Bach Perspectives</cite> assumes an academic audience with
    an interest & knowledge about music, but isn't targeted for musicologists only.]\r\n\r\nThe
    Broadway series is aimed at a general audience, period. Of course, the number
    of symbols used in the Broadway series are fewer, and varies from title to title
    -- really, author to author.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
