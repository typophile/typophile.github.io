  in their logo. The want to use the same font for headlines on their website, unfortunately
  Leawood Std. is not in the typekit.com library. Could you recommend a Leawood substitute
  that is available on Typekit? The closes I could find is http://typekit.com/fonts/adelle-web
  but I'm not too happy with that choice...\r\n\r\nThanks!"
