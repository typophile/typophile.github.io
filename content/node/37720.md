  reasons I am having to drastically scale back a serious handwriting habit-- I write
  many personal letters each week and journal constantly. I'm not looking for a face
  that replicates handwriting (though if any exist that don't get annoying after more
  than a paragraph or so, I'd be glad to know).

  body: 'Handwriting fonts say more about the creator''s personality and tend to wear
    out their welcome in long correspondence. The italic versions of some of the regular
    text fonts are extremely readable and would give a more informal feel if that''s
    what you''re after (e.g Goudy Oldstyle italic). But Stephen is right: you need
    a font to match your personality, or at least the tone you prefer to convey.'

  body: "Thanks... so, my personality: technology educator by day, poet by night.
    I love letterpress objects and fine books, though I can't afford too much of either.
    When I read, I tend to read with a pen in hand and mark liberally (I love marginalia
    and notes by others), so I don't revere every printed book as sacred. My taste
    is eclectic in just about everything (modern pop to classic jazz, prose poetry
    to classical forms) but if push comes to shove I'll take the old school over the
    new school. My own writing consists primarily of short poems, prose poems, and
    lyric personal essays.\r\n\r\nMoving to typing letters is painful for me because
    I have a real crazy fetish for fountain pens (I have scads) and fine cotton papers.
    Very close to that is my penchant for buying every kind of notebook/blank book/journal
    I find, which I fill with a lot of journalling, drafting of creative pieces, commonplace
    books of quotations, etc. For all of that, my handwriting is atrocious and I have
    not one whit of artistic talent, though I've tried calligraphy and sumi-e and
    even type design.\r\n\r\nIn person I'm the introvert in the crowd until the switch
    is flipped and then I'm the class clown, the one with the quick joke and I always
    have a sarcastic and/or ironic addition... I like making people laugh, particularly
    the ones with the secret, radiant smile. I teach, and my teaching includes some
    elements of stand-up comedy, performance art and monologue :)\r\n\r\nMy letters
    tend to be long, philosophical, include quotes and assemblages of words that have
    caught my fancy, and often don't include any of the typical \"news\" (the weather
    is fine, the kids are good, etc) or even a well-defined beginning or end. They
    stop and start and the assumption is the reader knows who I am and that I will
    likely write again to add more. \r\n\r\nHandwriting and comic faces aren't my
    thing... I want something that has a touch of formality but isn't all play...
    and not all work (I love TEFF Trinite and Lexicon, Storm  Jannon and Regent but
    they seem more suited to a memoir than a letter) either.\r\n\r\nThat probably
    doesn't help a bit :)"

  body: If you like the TEFF fonts you mention but find them <em>too</em> formal (and
    the price is quite up there), you might have a look at a typeface like [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=roman|Dolly]].
    It somewhat has the Lexicon-look, but less serious looking, yet not too playful
    either. :)

    works well where you have crafted your narrative and want the reader to savour
    and think about what you've written. A distinctive typeface with a bit more weight
    than typical text faces. Has an attractive, legible italic, old style figures
    and small caps, and you can get it in a reasonably priced OpenType package.

  body: As you are a poet, you might like Kent Lew's <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmanCharSet2.html">Whitman
    Italic</a>, a font which he has previously suggested might be useful for setting
    poetry. In my experience, it certainly looks very good in pull quotes. And a range
    of Display weights have now been added and will soon be available from Font Bureau.
