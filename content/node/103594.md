  thread</a> to build a font on the basis of some nice lettering from the 60ies I
  found on a residential building in Berlin...  I've got a pretty complete set of
  paths now, whose look in the Glyphs editor I rather like.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blumenkind_3944.png]\r\n\r\nProblem
  is, I need to stroke those paths to make a usable font. I'm not happy with the path
  expansion tool in Glyphs (it doesn't support rounded end caps and does unsightly
  things to sharp turns), so I've tried exporting an OTF from Glyphs to FontForge
  and doing it there.  The workflow is pretty atrocious, crash-ridden (on the side
  of FontForge) and doesn't work well for very thin weights, so I'm very much hoping
  to find a better solution.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a really good path stroking
  tool? Preferably free to use, though if you have a paid license, I might be interested
  to hire your services for a free license of the final font...\r\n\r\nHere's what
  it looks like when I stroke the font at 25/20 units with a 40\xB0 angle in FontForge.
  Not too bad, though as I said things break down at very light weights."

    there's a {tt} ligature in the font that I forgot to activate for that poster

    Oh, and I wrote \"an utopian\"? Really? Why does this forum forbid editing the
    first post again...?"

  body: As far as expanded path fonts go, this has some potential. The terminals need
    a bit of tinkering to look more natural. If you're set on going down the expanded
    path route, I'd suggest only using this model for the lightest weight. Add some
    contrast in unexpected places (maybe thicker in curves, where the pen would slow
    down) and I think you'll have something interesting. It reminds me of fifties
    lettering on space themed adverts, and weird contrast seemed to be all the rage
    then.

    to FontForge, expanding them there, and re-importing them to Glyphs for finishing.
    \ I put up a provisional Behance page for illustration:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/gallery/Blumenkind-a-bright-utopian-script-font/10159067\r\n\r\nAnd

    you can see, I went with a monolinear approach for the default cuts \u2014 it
    seems to work well enough for Rolling Pen after all...  also, it makes the round
    stroke terminals look natural. I also made a heavily contrasted \"calligraphic\"
    cut with diagonal stress. I found sharp cutoffs at the stroke ends look the most
    natural there. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of releasing Blumenkind in the next few days.
    Any last-minute thoughts?\r\n\r\n@ Dave: Adding stress in unexpected places sounds
    like fun, but also like more work than I was planning to put into Blumenkind.
    Perhaps an idea for a \"Blumenkind Pro\" further down the road...?"

    wonder if /U/u/ look a little too /V/v/ish.\r\nFor /G/ you might try having the
    \"triangle\" inverted (i.e. have its top flatter and its base pointier)."

  body: "@ Craig: Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nTittles and diacritics: I took that
    straight from the source that way, but of course I'm not obliged to reproduce
    it faithfully (for instance, I've made the {t} much nicer than it was). The {\xFC}
    was one of the letters I found most inspiring about the source, though.  I agree
    the overlapping forms are quite unconventional, and I could make Blumenkind more
    widely usable with more conventional diacritics. I might just make an alternate
    cut of the font for that, then. Good idea!\r\n\r\nYes, the {UuVv} look too much
    alike for my taste, but I haven't found a satisfying way of resolving the issue.
    I certainly want to keep the current shape of {Uu}, which I find very attractive
    and in line with the font's design philosophy. That doesn't leave much space for
    {Vv} to be different, though. I don't suppose two crossed slashes would work...
    Then again, the {UuVv} distinction is probably not very crucial to readability
    in most languages, is it?\r\n\r\nI've given the inverted {G} a couple of tries
    on paper, and I don't like it much \u2014 it looks top-heavy and menacing. One
    reason why Blumenkind looks so friendly is its teddybear-like cuddly and bottom-heavy
    shapes. The current design of {G} also allows its bottom terminal to angle inwards
    with a minimum of tension on the bottom corner, which I like."

    medium of the original dictated such Tittles and umlauts, but that's not the case
    with your font so it looks more arbitrary. I can see some of the quirky appeal
    you're talking about but I also find them confusing and distracting. \r\n\r\nOn
    the /U/u/, if you don't want a downward stem on the right (and I can see why you
    don't) just de-pointify the bottoms as much as you can without losing the triangular
    character. "

    tried widening the {u} at the base, but didn't like the result. It seemed to lose
    all the springy tension that characterizes the font. I guess I'll just keep it
    the way it is.\r\n\r\nI'm putting it on the test server now. If there are no glitches
    it should be out within a week or so.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
