body: "Looking for any info on an easy way to insert Service Mark - (\u2120)- glyph
  into documents - It is unicode 2120 but how can you tell average corporate users
  how to insert it or even what fonts contain it? This is an actual problem in a large
  business and any suggestions would be great. I do it in the Glyph table in InDesign
  but that not a solution for people using word processors - copyright, trademark
  are easy with keystrokes - but service mark?"

  body: "If you're using Windows XP, you can enable direct Unicode keypad entry by
    doing the following:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>Start the Registry Editor (<code>regedit.exe</code>)
    and navigate to the following key:\r\n<code>HKEY_Current_User/Control Panel/Input
    Method</code>.\r\n<li>Set the <code>EnableHexNumpad</code> value to <code>1</code>.\r\nIf
    the <code>EnableHexNumpad</code> value doesn't already exist, create it as a string
    value (<code>REG_SZ</code>).\r\n<li>Restart the computer.</ol>\r\n\r\n(This process
    can be automated by creating a simple <code>.reg</code> file and importing it
    on each of your computers. Let me know if you need help doing that.)\r\n\r\nOnce
    you've got that set up, you should be able to enter the \"\u2120\" character by
    holding down the ALT key and typing the following on the numeric keypad:\r\n\r\n<code>+&nbsp;8&nbsp;4&nbsp;8&nbsp;0</code>\r\n\r\n(That's
    five keys: You have to press the actual \"+\" key on the keypad before entering
    the four digits -- all while holding the ALT key down. In case you're wondering
    where the 8480 value comes from, it's the \"\u2120\" code point, U+2120, in decimal.)\r\n\r\nNote
    that the \"\u2120\" character will appear only if that glyph is defined in the
    the currently selected font. One way to check if a given font contains the glyph
    is to use Character Map (<code>charmap.exe</code>)."

  body: I use PopChar Pro to find "hidden" glyphs, but in Windows there's a "special
    character box" that can be opened from any application (it's somewhere in the
    "Start"-button I think, but I'm not sure). Don't know if there's any better solution
    (unless you'd know of a character with an easy shortcut that nobody actually ever
    types so you could change glyphs with it).

  body: "I forgot to mention this: If you don't mind a solution that's specific to
    Microsoft Word, you can enter an \u201C\u2120\u201D by simply typing 2120 into
    your document and then pressing ALT+X (hold down ALT and press the \"X\" key).
    If the current font doesn't contain the glyph, Word will automatically find one
    that does, and switch to it.\r\n\r\nThis should work on all Windows versions of
    Word starting with Word 2002. Don't know if there's an equivalent for Mac versions
    of Word."
