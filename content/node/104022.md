body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to replicate the 'iOS 7' title text for a project
  I am working on and I noticed that the version of Myriad/Myriad Set that is used
  is thinner than even Myriad Light, which is the thinnest version available commercially.
  Has this been made thinner by Apple's design team and if so, how can fonts be made
  thinner? I have added a sample below for reference.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ios_title_5872.png]"

    IMO to make very light weights by drawing a skeletal path and thickening it by
    stroking or parallel pathing. \r\n\r\nIn apps like InDesign, type can be thinned
    by applying a very fine outline in the background colour."
