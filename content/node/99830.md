  body: "Dick, it seems that Mouse Deco is derived from a proprietary font commissioned
    by Disney called Kem Weber. I think it's extremely unlikely that Disney (and/or
    the designers of Kem Weber, Terry Graboski and Ian MacGillivray) have authorized
    Mouse Deco, so you should think twice before promoting it, and Lana should preferably
    resist the convenience of using it.\r\n\r\nReading the comments on Mouse Deco
    on Dafont, it seems that Ferrera has -tellingly- had the sense to decline the
    numerous lucrative offers to pay for commercial usage of \"his\" design. Maybe
    that sort of decency can rub off on you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
