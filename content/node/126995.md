  body: the text was painted, along with the rest of the illustration by J. Howard
    Miller. You'll be hard pressed to find the exact font, FB Nobel is very close.
    Also Futura Bold Condensed or Avant Garde Bold Condensed could work very well.

  body: I've made several parodies of this poster. I've generally used Twentieth Century
    Bold as a starting point, but then I've heavily modified the letters to better
    match the proportions and wonkiness of those on the poster.
