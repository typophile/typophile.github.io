  body: What kind of food does the restaurant serve?  <BR>The logo seems contradictory
    to the name. It is kind of nice that way. I like it&#39;s feminine quality.However,it
    is very feminine and might alienate most of the male population. How is the place
    decorated? Your script style is quite elegent and sophisticated. I like the script
    in the top version but feel like the widow thing is a little much. I think I need
    more info for an accurate assesment.

  body: Thanks, David, for the response! <BR> <BR>The restaurant will serve unique
    gourmet food, dinners will be quite sophisticated and &#34;fancy&#34; &#40;like
    Macadamia Nut Crusted Sea Bass&#41; and lunches will have a more casual feel &#40;like
    Porcini-Gorgonzola Burgers&#41;. <BR> <BR>It is a long restaurant, half brick
    walls; the other half of the walls are painted with impressionistic european murals
    &#40;many have the shape of the window in the top example.&#41; The owners don&#39;t
    necessarily want any correlation to the &#34;brick&#34; or the literal name persay,
    but they do really like the unique paintings. <BR> <BR>Here is another sample
    that is just the script writing but not quite as &#34;much&#34; as sample &#34;f&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Any ideas on how i might create a logo to represent the ambiance and
    type of food without being so &#34;feminine&#34;? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39728.gif"

  body: 'I don&#39;t think restaurant logos NEEDS to echo the specifics of the food.
    That&#39;s what the food is for...the food will generate its own reputation without
    the need of the logo. Of course, you need to hint at the differences between a
    drive in burger joint and fine dining, but I think that&#39;s about the extent
    of it. <BR> <BR>The logo should represent the &#39;vibe&#39; though, IMHO. And
    I think yours does a wonderful job. I like both implementations and I think they
    can both be used together just fine. <BR> <BR>Is that your own calligraphy? '

    <BR>Thanks for the link, Scott, that is a cool site. I completely agree with you
    about a typeonly logo &#40;that is also a great idea to take cropped portions
    of the murals -- I will probably use that in creating their identity pieces.  <BR>
    <BR>Here is one more idea &#40;this is the one the client likes best so far&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Do you think the bricks add something or take away fromthe typeonly logo?

  body: I really like the hand-lettered look of Escrita, but I don&#39;t think the
    addition of the bricks does the logo justice. I agree with Scott&#39;s point about
    the versatility of a type-only logo. If the owners like the use of the brick imagery,
    I think it could be more effectively included elsewhere in some of the collateral,
    such as a separate, subtle graphic element on menus, promo materials, etc. The
    type-only logo is elegant and seems to fit your description of the restaurant
    on it&#39;s own; no need for added bells and whistles.  <BR> <BR>Nice work Sally!

    in that I prefer the type only version. And I&#39;d like to see it paired with
    the murals as mentioned. One small  thing though, to me the &#34;r&#34; sometimes
    looks like a &#34;z&#34; especially in version e, not so much in the later designs
    but still enough that when I glance quickly it looks like Bzick. <BR> <BR>Will
    the logo be black or color?

    sort of icon as part of the logo . . . i agree that it is much stronger as a type-only
    unit. &#40;it seems to &#34;junk up&#34; the logo and take away from the elegance&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I have refined the type and here are three examples of the type-only
    logo. There are just subtle differences between them -- any thoughts?  <BR> <BR>any
    suggestions? <BR> <BR>oh, and this will probably just be a one-color logo. I am
    not sure if it will be black or a color yet.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39759.gif"

    to make adjustments for readability. Note especially the swoosh from the k as
    it loops back over the i - it&#39;s starting to look like a t &#40;and thereby
    making it look like a completely different word&#41;

  body: 'Sally -- I may have been a little unclear, English is not my native language.
    <BR> <BR>What I meant: &#39;THE&#39; was a &#42;font&#42;, the rest was calligraphy.
    And I thought that &#39;THE&#39;, being just three letters, looked out of place
    with the rest. And should be executed as calligraphy as well, to be in harmony
    with the rest. Another way of looking at it, if you were to keep the font, you
    would need more letters, say &#39;THE RESTAURANT&#39; or similar length. Then
    it would be strong enough to play a role in a font/calligraphy contrast. <BR>
    <BR>Then I said &#40;and you didn&#39;t understand this&#41;: while calligraphing
    the word &#39;THE&#39; you can &#42;still&#42; make it capitals, and make it upright
    &#40;regular&#41; &#40;not slanted&#41;, depending of what&#39;s looking good.
    <BR> <BR>Haven&#39;t said so yet, but I think you&#39;re a skilled calligrapher.
    <BR> <BR>And I think getting rid of the pictoral element I saw in your first posting
    was an improvement. <BR> <BR>Going to London for three days now, see you later.

    have in versions H and I created an unbalanced arrangement where all the elements

    first &#39;the&#39;, then a little down ... then &#39;Brick&#39;, then a little

    underneath, and then, for balance, &#39;the&#39; &#40;or &#39;The&#39;?&#41; should
    be placed somewhere above &#39;ick&#39; or &#39;ckLa&#39; ...  <BR> <BR>Whether
    or not &#39;RESTAURANT&#39; needs a bolder face as regards to signage ... well
    that depends on the technique of the sign, the colours, the walking speed of the
    specific street and so on. Although I wouldn&#39;t make the so bold/heavy that

    printed in small sizes. <BR> <BR>Determine what is the &#39;worst case&#39; as
    regards to small size and printing on coarse materials. &#40;Paper napkin?&#41;
    Then look at the counters of &#39;h&#39; and &#39;e&#39; ... do you want them
    to be filled when printing very small sizes? No? Well, then you have an indication
    of just how big and how heavy the &#39;the&#39; should be. &#40;But as Scott says,
    it shouldn&#39;t be very much&#41;. <BR> <BR>Have you considered/tried a capital-T
    in &#39;the&#39;? It certainly would fit in with the rest as regards to style
    &#40;calligraphy, old times and so on&#41;. Moreover, it wouldn&#39;t add some
    weight to the element. But then again, maybe it doesn&#39;t work -- but it think
    it should be tried, before you declare the design finished. <BR> <BR>Looks nice
