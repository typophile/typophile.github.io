  unfortunately we don't have specimen books to go with it (at least we cannot find
  them). We only have two posters. Does anyone know where to find these books?"

  body: I threw those books out years ago. They weren't that helpful. You have the
    fonts, what's the problem?

  body: No problem at all. I thought that it sometimes might be useful to have a specimen,
    so to be able to judge the fonts better.
