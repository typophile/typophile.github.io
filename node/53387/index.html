I agree about trying a blank sky. Maybe lowering the horizon, and/or widening the "aspect ratio" of the box? The shading (getting dark left-to-right) does not make the "ground" recede.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with all the above.  You could also simplify it more, since the "water" is coming across more as "blue wood grain" and go with a bit of a fade from the horizon forward.   Also, I'm not sure the condensed font is working for you.  And lastly, does it have to be in a rectangle?  Historically, horizons have been viewed through spyglasses, creating a circular viewing field...  and this would play off of your newly circular "o"s  if you went with, I dunno... Gotham?   *(you could play with kerning, bringing it looser towards the edges giving a feel of "converging towards center" if it was put back in the water)    Play with it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">thx for feedback, all.

initial idea was based off a b/w illustration of wood grain, which I redrew w/ earth tones. it was very detailed, so we cut back number of lines, which led to the illustration we've got here. then we switched to a blue palette. the whole time, its resembled horizon w/ sun, and now its losing the wood grain origin and becoming nicely simplified.

the type is gotham condensed.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure if a vast body of water works well as a concept. Maybe it's just me, but the first association is drowning. I do like 1A version though. 

Have you considered turning this into a hill-like landscape instead ? Simply make an elevation map, use your existing approach to paint the elevation bands and then make a perspective 3D projection with flat horizon

Hmmm .. not sure how clear the explanation is, but basically start with something like <strong>[[http://marion.sanap.org.za/MapPrinceEdward3dsmall.jpg|this]]</strong>, replace color gradients in each individual band with a solid color and then rotate the whole thing to fill in the view and so that no peak sticks out above the horizon.

		<div class="commentbody">I re-read your original post. If the company is in Colorado, then you've got some very distinct horizons to draw from (mountains) which will give the mark a subject. Right now it feels a bit too depopulated. Horizons is a pretty common business name, so you should strive, as others have suggested, not to be too abstract with your imagery, or else you'll end up feeling like a nursing home (which is a business in my area) with the setting suns and vaguely placid look.</div>

Horizon, as it relates to celestial objects is used for navigation, rough estimates of time of day and other general figuring out. Celestial objects are generally visible at night. Thinking of the folk music, campfire, stars, moon, plus commerce and modernity, now satellite and stage light. I wonder if a stage light and a satellite could be combined into a hybrid and still be iconic and function as a logo? I wonder if a contemporary icon could be rendered in a handmade, warmish way?</div>

If you are going to use waves, their colors looking like a gradient is inevitable. The fundamental way to create atmosphere is for the object that is further from the foreground to have a lighter intensity. 

Is the company more about the management or the music? I'm not sure that this would appeal to a singer/songwriter.</div>

hey thx for all the feedback + input, really appreciate it.

rethinking this a bit, trying to simplify and start with a solid visual concept. here a few _rough_ ideas, aiming to be tied more to mountains and horizon lines, and hoping these would communicate primarily to industry folks, and musicians second -- I'd like to settle into one direction and then try to incorporate something subtle that speaks directly to musicians if possible, but keeping it fairly general for now.

leaving 'management' out for now…

		<div class="commentbody">While I get the Colorado reference, just a word of caution about using a mountain (like you did in the second one of your most recent sketches): It could read as something that <em>stands in the way</em> – not a very good thing for artist management. (This struck a nerve as I just had the same discussion with a client of mine who wanted a mountain in her logo.) 
If you want mountains, I'd rather think about the impression of standing on top of one, looking out over a vast landscape (and possibly, other mountains) stretching out in front of you – rather than a mountain towering straight in front of you, blocking the light!

By the way, it may help to think about the tone/voice this should have. Your 
latest sketches cover a pretty extreme range from corporate to "skateboardish". 
Which is more appropriate?</div>

third logo ..... you are trying to give the word a mountain shape

but it is not clear......... try again to make it more clear by giving the H a smaller size , and re-size all the letter to give it a mountain shape... and i thing a different font will work better... a font with thicker typeface


about the first sketch...... there is something in the 3rd row on the left

I like @designtn's truncated type, it works well for a more general management company, IMO. 

because this company is working exclusively with small recording artists in the folk/rock realm, and is based in colorado, it makes sense to me to have a graphic expression, ie the soundwave/mtn. they're striving not to look too corporate, yet retain a professional feel, and some personality and authenticity.

I also agree, its either a graphic expression OR a type treatment, not both.

Really like the thoughts @epsilicon had about shading -- I'd love for this to work in bw, but definitely plan on having this show more depth with shading or tinting of a couple colors. 

@litera, I agree w/ you about picks from this round - they're less lip-like and quicker reads.

		<div class="commentbody">Miss Tiffany makes a good point. The type below makes it hold back a bit. The punch of the logo that is. But obviously you stated that the client has already chosen a logo. For future reference however, you might find this article useful: 
http://freelanceswitch.com/general/dissecting-the-logo-design-creation-process/

And for some great inspiration on the use of positive and negative space, you might want to look at this one here: 
http://abduzeedo.com/clever-logos

Overall, your logo looks good and I'm sure it'll fit the needs as it's already met the criteria of your client. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">atw, there are many suggestions that can be offered to strengthen the logo. You can make it tighter and cleaner. If the client, however, has already picked the design then you're good to go. 

If you're still working on color variations, it may be possible to bring some boldness or strength to the design. The type definitely would have to be re-arranged. Nothing major, but as Miss Tiffany suggested; make it look less forced. But you'll need to provide other variations for this. Hopefully things are going well with the process though. </div>

I would consider getting rid of thinner parts of the curves though. They were needed in a b/w version to show the perspective, but here the same can be done with just the colors. Something like this (thin segment still needs to be thickened to match other curves):

		<div class="commentbody">I came late to the party on this one. Getting caught up. A couple of thoughts though, assuming the thread isn't dead... First of all, I loved this thread because of Aaron's willingness to listen to advice and go in a completely different direction in order to make things better. The difference between the very first proposal and this "nearly finished" logo is remarkable. Nice work! I would like to second (or third) the advice that you consider using the icon as the logo. The only caution I would throw out is how similar it is to the Wachovia Bank logo (www.wachovia.com). Wachovia has branches in Colorado... don't want to get confused. Good Luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">woah ... this thread is STILL going?
hasn't exactly come leaps and bounds in 2 months.

but as mentioned the latest 'icon' is looking pretty good.
I still see cigarettes though ... but there is a brand here called horizons that use those exact colours. and on the colour topic ... it just kinda seems cold and impersonal.

I really like the wood grain concept ... it just feels warm and ... workable.

why not use a thin wedge/hemisphere of wood placed with it's outer trunk pointing up (creating a curved horizon.)
