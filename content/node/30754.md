    through the fine folks at <a href=\"http://www.sil.org/\">SIL</a> (formerly the
    Summer Institute of Linguistics), whose resources you should check for typography
    resources on any endangered language."

      I'm not able to load it, so that I can work with it. I'll try it now with Fontlab.
      \r\nAnd I try SIL."
