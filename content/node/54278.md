body: "Last semester we had to design a booklet on a certain time period in graphic
  design history. I had three, and although my booklet was not my best work, there
  is one artist who's work I fell in love with from \"The New Conceptual Poster\"
  era. Gitte Kath. The texture in some of her posters makes me want to touch them:
  there's an almost tactile quality to them. Some of her posters take months to create
  and usually incorporate more than one medium. These posters, for example, incorporate
  photography and painting. I also enjoy the fact that many of her projects have the
  same background: she uses an old painted wall as a background when photographing
  objects. I just love collaged pieces!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small_Gitte_Kath_6579.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
  designer I've noticed in a few time periods, New Conceptual Poster and New Typographic
  Expression, is Paula Scher. Some of her most famous pieces include her work for
  the New York Public Theatre and 'Bring in da noise, bring in da funk' posters. My
  favorite of hers though, is her poster for the \"Diva is Dismissed\". It's kind
  of simple, but extremely accurate in portraying the idea of the show. And I love
  the expression on the woman's face.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scher001_3818.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  other piece that caught my eye is from the more Recent British Graphic Design. At
  first, all I saw were stamps, but then on the page previous, I saw the image of
  the back side of a mannequin and seemingly random blue brushstrokes. I love the
  contrast between them. Much of the time period involved combining new media and
  new design studios with new approaches to 'visual problem solving'. (I'm not sure
  who the author is or even what the title is right now, but I'll find out and post
  it tomorrow!)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small_3_4122.jpg]"
