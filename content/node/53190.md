    is conceptually similar to the SimpleBits one:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplebits-avatar_6005.gif]\r\n\r\n"

    there are a dozen Worboys in your area.\r\n\r\nI love the color scheme, but I'd
    like to know what the idea behind the curly brackets is?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Since \"Worboys\" is my last name, it is what it is.  Which is pronounced
    \"War-Boys\", so I guess it's good that you read it that way.  But there are definitely
    no others in my area so I've decided to drop the \"M\".  \r\n\r\nThe curly bracket
    was a design element that I've always liked, no real rhyme or reason behind it.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for everyone's response.  Helps out a lot!"
