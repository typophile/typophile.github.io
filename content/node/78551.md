  body: "Patrick, I know I've been away for a while, so maybe I haven't made this
    request for a few weeks, but would you mind making your post titles a bit more
    descriptive? At the present moment there are at least 14 or 15 posts showing with
    titles that have as much information in them as yours. \r\n\r\nHow are we supposed
    to be able to find them again after we go hunting for answers?\r\n\r\nFor example,
    your post could say \"STILL VAST RESERVES narrow caps sans serif\", and maybe
    we'd know which thread it was ten hours from now when we find what font it is.
    Then we could find your post and answer it.\r\n\r\nAs the thread originator, you
    can still edit this title and make it helpful to those of us who are trying to
    help you.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: as for the id, im not sure if its plak, the R is different, it feels closer
    to  flat sided gothic, but still different than that
