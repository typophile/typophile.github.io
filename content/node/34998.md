body: "I tried to add aditional ligatures to a font with Microsoft Volt. I tried to
  add them both under a new lookup and under an existing lookup. The new ligatures
  simply don't join. When I open that font with Fontlab Studio 5, I can't find any
  data regarding the new ligature glyph in the OpenType panel. All existing lookups
  are still there, but the newly placed ones are absent. Are there any incompatibility
  issues? \r\n\r\nBesides, altering a font with Fontlab and generating a new OT font
  out of it doesn't work well. The new font is done with errors with a greatly reduced
  file size and opening it with VOLT requires overwriting of the layout data."

    application did you test your font with? Does it work in VOLT proofing tool?\r\n\r\nFont
    edited by VOLT contains separate table with project sources. This table may be
    big enough to be comparable with font size, it is removed only when you \"ship\"
    font from VOLT. Once font is shipped, you can not edit it in VOLT anymore.\r\n\r\nFontLab
    does not understand VOLT project syntax and tries to parse GSUB/GPOS tables directly,
    but can not import them completely. This is why you may not see some of your lookups.
    FontLab can export VOLT lookups, but does not do very good job at this. There
    are many basic syntax errors in result preventing VOLT to import them.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
