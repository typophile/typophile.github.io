body: "I have been reading this book called \"Manual of graphic techniques 3\" (old,
  but quite an interesting read) and one of the samples used there caught my eye.\r\n\r\nI
  thought it's just a hand-drawn sample of type treatment, not a typeface itself,
  as I couldn't find any information about it in the credits. I like it so much, I
  was thinking of making the rest of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm too naive and
  inexperienced, just recently stumbled into some artwork with the same looking type
  in it.\r\n\r\nI assume there is a typeface, so I would like you to help me identifying
  it. I've attached a photograph of it (the \"Mercury\" one):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4920.jpg]"

    think that's what the moderators did after your post, relocated the thread."
