  project. setting text in german language, i found the font's \"\xDF\" not that suitable
  for my purpose. it's looking a bit \"old fashioned\" whereas the font itself is
  rather modern. unfortunately, the two alternive \"\xDF\" are not evoked by the opentype
  titling alternatives or other opentype programmings. it seems as if it isn't even
  possible to search and replace the specific character in indesign, for i can't place
  the alternative glyph (taken from the indesign glyph table) into the replace field.
  it won't be recognized correctly then and just \"^;\" will be replaced instead of
  the real glyph.\r\nany suggestions/solutions for that issue?\r\n\r\nalex schmidt"

  body: Hmm. That's a tough question. Obviously picking the alternate in the glyph
    palette wouldn't be an option. Unfortunately, when this font was authored no one
    supported stylistic sets. The good news is that the license on my fonts allows
    users to decompile/recompile/edit as long as they don't resell them. I could probably
    give you a custom cut, though. I'm assuming that you bought a license ;)

  body: "hello christian, nice to meet you here. :)\r\nthis font was actually bought
    by the client from veer after i suggested it for the work. apart from me, the
    font is used by a translator and a layouter, who don't even  know, that i want
    to have the \"\xDF\" changed. the deadline for printing is near, and i don't want
    to upset the people with bringing in a changed font right now. therefore i've
    been looking for a search&replace solution. On the other hand, this is not very
    practical anyhow, because of wrong spelling and hyphenation problems. \r\n\r\nwhere
    did you get the inspiration for drawing the \"\xDF\" this way? i'm asking, because
    here in germany you won't meet this specific form very often \u2013 although,
    you can see it on a lot of street signs here in berlin (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Berliner_Strassenschilder.jpg).
    \r\nthis form derives from the ligature long-s and blackletter-z. that's what
    makes it look a bit nostalgic. the commonly used one derives from long-s and short-s
    \u2013 double-s, so to speak. although it is not the same as \"ss\"... okay, german
    language \u2013 difficult to understand anyway. but whom i'm talking with \u2013
    i guess, you have thought about all that when drawing the alternative forms.\r\n\r\ni'd
    like to come back to your offer after talking to the client (maybe he likes the
    \"\xDF\" the way it is anyway ;)).\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>edit:</strong> btw, it is
    the pill gothic condensed 1 package."
