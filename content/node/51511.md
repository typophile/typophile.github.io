  body: It's not in the ascii set or generally part of most standard fonts. You could
    compose one in fonts that have superior letters. Some fonts also may include it
    in extended sets. I think Zapfino has it. My font Memoir at Veer has it as a discretionary
    ligature. You might want to look up character specimens on sites such as MyFonts,
    Fontshop or Veer.

  body: "Added Thought.\r\n\r\nIf you are using PopChar; does this, by chance indicate
    you are using applications that aren't OpenType compatible? Where I work we are
    still chained to Freehand and use PopChar to access some characters."

  body: "I've not had to do a decent c/o for a long time and my memory was that superiors
    were too small and if one made them bigger it was difficult to match the weight
    of the 'c' to the 'o', but I'll try again ...\r\n\r\nI long ago ceased to need
    the likes of Freehand, so I suspect that all my apps are OK with OpenType - sorry
    that I can't help there.\r\n\r\nCheers, Colin\r\n--\r\nNo furniture so charming
