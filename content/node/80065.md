  of Leipzig.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schriftausstellung_mtt_03_5143.jpg]\r\n.\r\nThe
  show focuses on recent type design trends and the younger folks associated with
  the typedesign class at the local HGB art academy. Of the more established designers
  F. Smeijers, E. Kaiser and A. St\xF6tzner are featured. \r\n\r\nThe selection of
  works is complemented by a small but exquisite choice of type specimen of the area\u2019s
  former foundries, from around 1890 to 1930.\r\nTypographic projects are presented
  by an array of artefacts: from sketches to type specimen, from books to posters;
  much of it can be physically handled by the visitor.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t miss it if
  you happen to be in the area. [[http://www.kunstvereinleipzig.de|More about the
  exhibition]] which runs until April 24.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schriftausstellung_mtt_09_5341.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schriftausstellung_mtt_15_5966.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schriftausstellung_mtt_17_5297.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schriftausstellung_mtt_12_5180.jpg]"
