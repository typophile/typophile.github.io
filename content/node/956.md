body: 'Greetings fellow typophiles: <BR> <BR>I developed these templates a few years
  ago and thought they might be of some use to those who work in Illustrator. They
  are set up on 11 x 17 pages and accommodate 60 characters per sheet &#40;there are
  2 templates&#41;. I use them for roughing out ideas and storing glyphs for importing
  into FontLab. <BR> <BR>You can adjust the x-height, etc by unlocking the guides,
  selecting and moving their positions. &#40;See below for a sample gif.&#41;  <BR>
  <BR>The files are zipped for PC folks and stuffed for Mac users. You can download
  them here: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.intelligentdesign.com/font_templates/" target="_blank">http://www.intelligentdesign.com/font_templates/</a>
  <BR> <BR>Also: If anyone has any bright ideas, please feel free to improve upon
  the existing design, email them to me and I will post new versions. <BR> <BR><img
