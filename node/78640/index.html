This is for a Film production company that focuses on music videos.

The name is swedish. Lingon translates to lingonberry.

Client wanted something rock 'n roll, nice and serious.

Still trying to find the correct type treatment but later I'll add a wreath. Something like they use for filmfestivals.

All feedback appreciated
Thanks, 
Peter

"Kreativa Killar" is swedish for "creative guys" but it sounds better in swedish. This part is going to be incorporated into a laurel wreath that will symbolize film production.

any feedback appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,

Some updates on this project.

Client added a beaver to the logo. Symbolizes various thinks that I'm not gonna go into in detail, mostly the work spirit of the beaver.

Trying to keep it fairly simple, got a wreath around the beaver for "awarded films". It also has a beret on his head, a hat that director Ingmar Bergman used frequently.

Have a problem with the tail of the beaver. The client wants the tail there to make sure people see it as a beaver.

Type is also slightly updated and "Kreativa Killar" is left out for now.

Any feedback appreciated
Peter

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, sorry, but I don't see a beaver at all. I did, however, see lots of other fun things. The first thing I saw was a dog wearing a raspberry beret.  Next thing I saw was a little alien wearing wide hip-hop pants. Then, circular wings of a bird.  In short, if this was an ink splotch test, I'm officially nuts.

I'm sorry, I know this isn't very helpful, so here's a picture of my nephew's favorite stuffed animal for a little beaver inspiration.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, you are going to have to really work to fit all that stuff into the logo.  In my opinion, it is too much focus on the images and not enough on the concept that is communicated.  Maybe a beaver wearing a raspberry beret means something to you, but what does it mean to anyone else?  Lingonberry, Beaver, Rock N Roll, Serious,  Ingmar Bergman, Awarded films, etc.  It is just too much for this logo to bear, I'm afraid.</div>

Yeah gonna make new teeth and sort some other stuff out too.

Still gonna try and add a tail to make it more beaver. Not really sure where I'm going to pout it, the only available space is above the head.

I think the face is pretty good actually. The cartoon style is not what we're looking for. It's supposed to be fairly simple, think this is a bit too much for the client still even if they like this direction.

Gonna post some updates shortly.</div>

And by having all these element in your symbol I don't see anything related to those film awards logos. If somebody tells me that this should relate to it then yes I could say "ok it resembles a bit" but without anyone telling me I wouldn't come up with this relation at all.

I don't think this works and I think you're too distracted in beaver details that don't work as expected. I think you've come to a point where you should step back and think of the general idea that you'd like to accomplish here.</div>

Some more updates.

Now we skipped the film reel and just have a retro camera there instead.

I've also given the beaver a tail to make it more clear what animal it is. Then just a frame around it to limit it a bit. Don't really have time to start drawing proper hands and feet.

Any feedback appreciated.

If you're looking for visual reference, you might try going to http://www.iStockPhoto.com and using their search box to search for "beaver", then on the results page click the "illustration" checkbox to filter out photos and leave just the illustrations. You'll end up with 5 pages containing over 200 beaver illustrations, and perhaps some will serve as inspiration.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah I get a bit of a wolf feeling at the moment as well. Maybe some rounder cheeks would help.

It is a bit busy at the moment, trying to find a nice frame for it, the current one doesn't really feel right. The "rays" behind it are also a test, but I think I'll have to skip those cus now it dosen't work so well in one color, becomes even busier.

I'm gonna try another frame version with the wreath I had before. Might give it some space.

I have looked at illustrations already but thanks James.

Will post an updated version soon.</div>

How about a laurel wreath on one side, and a stylized beaver tail on the other so that they look symmetrical?  To me the beaver tail needs to have a grid pattern on it to be clear what it is.</div>

also, your conceptual approach seems weird, first you mention it's about the work ethic of the beaver...but then you're going on about referencing propaganda posters—which is generally associated with influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position so as to benefit oneself. Which doesn't seem all that positive.

as clauses has said, the thread is all kinds of awesome. but you still don't have a logo.

It's really highly problematic (I think) to treat «concept» as something separate from «visual style» (as sort of a coating that can be slapped on or not). Form isn't just style – it communicates, and it's charged with meaning. In other words if you don't want people to have associations in the direction of [political] propaganda from a distinct historical reference period, if you don't want to hint at anything that propaganda posters represent then maybe you shouldn't make it look like a propaganda poster.
I agree it looks kinda cool... but it's still completely unclear what this needs to communicate.</div>

I can safely say that has never come up in a critique I've been a part of.

Have you looked at this thing small, business card size? Your film camera is going to disappear and look like another pair of red eyeballs. It might help you simplify the drawing.
