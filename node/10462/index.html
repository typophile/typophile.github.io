  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm the art director for a small theater company whose unofficial motto is &quot;theater for people who hate theater; theater for people who love theater.&quot; <BR> <BR>Our audience, for the most part, ranges from 18-35, not your typical theatergoing crowd. Here is the logo, plus some recent poster images, to give you an idea of the kind of work we do: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7036.gif" alt="impact"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7037.jpg" alt="scab"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7038.jpg" alt="henry iv"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7039.jpg" alt="mouse"> <BR> <BR>Now, the request: I want to select a typeface (with both display and text weights) that reflects the company's attitude. Show logos will always vary, but I want to keep the information font the same from poster to poster (other design elements will also help create a consistent look among posters). <BR> <BR>In addition, I want the typeface to be appropriate for text usage, such as for the program. Two faces I've considered are <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">HTF Gotham</a> and <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_faceplate.html">PsyOps Faceplate Sans</a>, but neither seems to really fit the bill. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions will be quite helpful.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Mix is a bit extravagant, quite annoying in longer texts (I think the German magazine H=F6rzu used it, horror on the eyes. ) Other than = that ANY font by Lucas is well worth ist money, you'll never regret spending your money on him :-). I cannot think of another European Font Designer with as much flair and a taste for readable and practical, yet very unique and individual fonts. Luc(as), in my humble opinion, is one of the finest typographers on the continent, with a sense of sleek and pure functionality and a wild streak that leads to monstrous gigantic families and hundreds of extra characters and thousands of kerning pairs&hellip; And on lucasfonts.com we just see the fonts on sale, there's a bit more he did for corporate designs, like the Volkswagen Futura riff, a Multiple Master with old style figures&hellip; Coolest Futura ever :-). <BR> <BR>Also very good, if you work with InDesign, albeit not as unique as Lucas work: Chaparral pro and Myriad pro, both available at adobe.com</div>

		<div class="commentbody">FF Info.  <BR>VERY nice font, typical Spiekermann, a mix of Meta and Officina sensibilities. But be careful: The info, you can't see this as clear on he web, is very rounded, as it was designed for the Duesseldorf International Airport and was to be used in backlighted signs and displays. So it has a very unique feel, and after a time of using it as nodesign's house-font, I got very very tired of it, especially as it isn't really a good font for longer text. (Well, duh.. the new CD font we use is FF DIN, not much better to read when it comes to long texts, but at least clearer and colder&hellip; and better suited for the steel engraving we use on our letterheads and biz cards).  <BR> <BR>Bliss is cool but will rip a massive hole into your pockets as well, Jeremy Tankard ain't cheap :-D.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Luc(as) OSFs are more modern, not as playful as the Neufville Medievals. Neufville looks more Art Deco, but Luc somehow captured the cleaner, more geometric and practical aspect of the Futura. While it doesn't feel as historical, maybe, it just fits better into the context and it is MUCH better for practical purposes, at it doesn't feel as jarringly old-fashioned. Such a shame I cannot use that font in any commercial work at all, as it is licensed to Volkswagen exclusively.</div>

Cost: you could buy the parts of the mega-family that you need as you as go.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Sean. For some reason, Base has just always rubbed me the wrong way. <BR> <BR>Hrant: point well taken. I think at this point my top three choices are: <BR> <BR>Bliss <BR>FF Info <BR>TheMix <BR> <BR>And of course the most expensive one is at the top of the list. But I sent a plea off to the foundry, and hopefully Mr Tankard will take pity on me. <BR> <BR>I have one more poster to do this season, and I'm probably going to try out some of my ideas. I'll post them in the critique section. In this way I'm hoping to work the kinks out before I start the new season this summer. <BR> <BR>Sean &ndash; I've done posters for theater for a long time, and generally speaking, it's the most fun I've had as a designer. Impact especially has let me do pretty much whatever I've wanted. No pay to speak of, really, but damn fun.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know why Emigre fonts mostly leave me cold. I never seem to have projects that Emigre fits nicely, at least in my opinion. I appreciate their craft, but their designs just don't usually speak to me, with the notable exception of Triplex Sans Condensed, but I would never set text in Triplex Sans, so I'm out of luck for this project. Quelle bummer. <BR> <BR>FF Meta, on the other hand, seems to be gaining interest for me. Info, as HD pointed out, has a softness to it that may ultimately undo it for me, plus that the romans and the italics are in two different sets, as opposed to separated by weight. I don't understand people sometimes. <BR> <BR>Here's the lowdown on the Impact logo &ndash; I didn't design it so much as redesign it. Originally it was like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7151.jpg" alt="impact old"> <BR> <BR>And I never really cared for it that much. The old artistic director (as opposed to an art director) made it. So when I came on board, I just wasn't using it on posters, and no one seemed to notice. <BR> <BR>Then I came up with a different direction: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7152.jpg" alt="impact revision"> <BR> <BR>But it turned out, they liked their logo and didn't want to go too far afield. (Plus, I'll admit, Bell Gothic is a bit overused these days.) So I fused the two into a solution I can live with: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7153.jpg" alt="impact"> <BR> <BR>I'm mostly happy with it, but it's really hard to use. I'm currently trying to get them to agree to a fundraising idea where we just have t-shirts with the logo without the splat, and people can pay to shoot a paintball gun at their shirt and make their own splats. Could be fun.</div>

Plus, Thirstype's release is actually much deeper than what's on Intersection's site: there are four weights, not two, and you can get the whole thing for $49 before the end of the month. It may not be what I ultimately go with for the theater, but it has nice potential, and I'll be glad to have it regardless.</div>
