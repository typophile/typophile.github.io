  body: "Heroic Condensed is close but that's not it. Should be one of the condensed
    versions of [[https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]], [[http://commercialtype.com/news/updates/new_widths_of_graphik_for_iesquirei_and_ibon_appeacutetiti|exclusive
    for Esquire]] and not commercially available.\r\nAs alternative, from the same
    foundry, [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/giorgio/sans/heavy|Giorgio Sans
    Heavy]] using the alternate un-spurred /G might work pretty well."
