  was looking for something simple and dynamic that would reproduce well on just about
  anything.\r\n\r\nI don't pass myself off as an expert in corporate ID therefore
  constructive comments welcome, and I will return the favour if I can!!  Thanks.

  body: "I like it. You might try making the bottom of the L slightly thinner, but
    overall I think it looks good.\r\n\r\nI noticed that on your home page you present
    your logo two different ways -- the large one is white and not in a box, and the
    small one is black in a white box. Generally speaking it's better to be consistent."

  body: Thanks chaps.  Fair point about consistency, and I'll look at the geometry.

  body: I assume the thinner bottom line suggestion is to do with the percieved balance
    of the weight of the lines?
