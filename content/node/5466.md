body: yesterday i got a little job from a friend that has to be finished on monday.
  they need a logotype for a cd-rom student guide in vienna. its called &#34;viennavigator&#34;.
  it has to work on that blue background because it&#39;s the ci color of the publishing
  house which distributes the product. <BR> <BR>i&#39;d be thankful for any suggestions.

  body: I like the handwritten/script font much better than the more corporate looking
    sans serif logos. The handwritten ot me fits better and sort with the theme. I
    am not sure you need all of the arrows on either side. Maybe some sort of mark
    with just one arrow like the north arrow on a map in the same sort of style as
    the type like you have done. I don&#39;t know if thats been overplayed, just an
    idea.

  body: thanks for your comment tom, it is encouraging to hear my own thoughts from
    another person!  <BR> <BR>but it definitely needs a lot of adjustment. hope the
    time will be sufficient.

  body: Always the case haha it seems with clients. Looks like Thesis &#40;I love
    that typeface&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t understand why the n and the a are highlighted,
    and the directional arrow to me is a bit lost with the modifications to it. Although
    I do like how it is more stylized and skewed to match the italic letters.

  body: 'n and a re highlighted because they are the letters where the two words &#34;vienna&#34;
    and &#34;navigator&#34; merge. the intention is to make that clear &#40;and it
    obviously doesn&#39;t work&#41; <BR> <BR>one should be able to read vienna and/or
    navigator. '

  body: why don&#39;t you try to colorize the &#34;a&#34; only? It will give it more
    ...erm, centered look. Colors are nice, blue/orange scheme looked too much Microsoft-ish

  body: titus <BR> <BR>i like it, but have you tried to include the arrows to your
    letters, i mean that your &#34;v&#34; can start with your left arrow, the decender
    of your second &#34;n&#34; can be your down arrow, the second &#34;v your up arrow,
    and the &#34;r&#34; your right arrow, i would also see how it works with less
    arrows &#40;as someone commented&#41;, maybe three or two. <BR> <BR>nice work
