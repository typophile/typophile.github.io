  until it was handed into my hands. I said NO. I won't produce a design with a lousily
  traced font.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is this font?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/belwether_6345.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks"

    since our daughter lives there. I recognized the Hotel name right away. Very popular
    for weddings, right on Bellingham Bay, surrounded by marinas.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
