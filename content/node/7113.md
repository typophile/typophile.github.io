body: I have a project to design a short &#34;zine&#34; -  my tutors have given me
  the freedom to chose ANY subject I want!! I&#39;m not sure whether to make it very
  personal or just choose an interest of mine. Just wondering if anyone has any good
  examples of magazines or online &#34;zines&#34; that have nice experimental typography?  I
  saw some stuff by Emigre that was very nice and also thisisamagazine.com.. any help
  is very welcome or tell me what you think would make an interesting zine.

  body: 'Here&#39;s a crazy idea: <BR>Make a zine that&#39;s recursively about itself.
    The middle spread will be like a regular zine about something or other, with pretty
    straightforward typography&#42;. Then the sheets before and after the middle will
    be about the zine in the middle &#40;talking about the discussion about whatever
    the &#34;center&#34; topic is&#41;, with 2-layered typography. And so on with
    the sheets outside of those engaging in increasingly removed/layered meta-discussion/-typography.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Or it could be about nothingness - empty. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hmm, that is interesting.  I will have to figure this one out :D They want
    us to question what a magazine is. One person is doing a i zine from life to death.
    I am not so good with these abstract themes!

  body: I like the idea of a magazine about itself, altough it could be an obsessive
    task, from the point of view of a student it would be an excellent reflective
    and analityc exercise &#40;are this two last words well written?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I
    would do It

  body: An empty magazine that encourages the reader to write/make their own contribution
    - interesting idea, pose more questions than answers. Or a crit-zine where you
    reproduce an article from a favourite magazine and invite a critique on the basis
    of typography, design, content &amp;c. contributors could post their observations
    and this would invite discussion from others, it could soon be enormous. <BR>Tim

  body: '&#62; That sounds very interesting, I like the idea of interactivity. But
    i &#62; have to make it a downloadable PDF file, like thisisamagazine.com. So
    &#62; the pages will have to be &#34;made&#34; already. I will talk to the tutors
    &#62; tomorrow and see what they say.'

    <BR>I like as well the idea of interactivity, it just would be for certain kind
    of people, wouldn&#39;t it?'

    niche advertising, aligned on a certain coordinate, and a commercial viability
    &#40;Something which could be achieved if the circulation figures meet the cost
    of production '
