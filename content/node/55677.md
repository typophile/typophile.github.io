body: "[Also posted to ATypI member discussion list.]\r\n\r\nWe're all familiar, I'm
  sure, with pangrams: sentences that contain all the letters of a given language
  alphabet, e.g. 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' or '\u0412 \u0447\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0445
  \u044E\u0433\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u043B-\u0431\u044B\u043B \u0446\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0441--\u0434\u0430,
  \u043D\u043E \u0444\u0430\u043B\u044C\u0448\u0438\u0432\u044B\u0439 \u044D\u043A\u0437\u0435\u043C\u043F\u043B\u044F\u0440\u044A!'\r\n\r\nI
  would like to build a collection of pan-diacritic-grams, i.e. sentences that contain
  all the accented or other diacritic letters that occur in a given language alphabet.
  The sentences would not need to include the complete set of all letters used in
  that alphabet, just all the diacritic letters. This would be a handy resource when
  making character test documents for multilingual fonts.\r\n\r\nSome languages have
  well-defined diacritic sets, while others, like English, use diacritics only exceptionally
  or in load words. I'm not too concerned about the latter, but for languages that
  use diacritics regularly it would be great to have sample sentences showing them
  all.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any examples of such sentences, or would anyone
  care to try to make one for his or her language?"

    all the main accented letters commonly used (\xE0\xE8\xE9\xEC\xF2\xF9), plus a
    few less used (\xF3, which is very little used, and \xEE, which stands for 'ii'
    or the archaic 'ij').\r\nNo black magic used, but it turned out quite weird, and
