body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI have recently created a font for my typography class.
  This is the first attempt to design a font. Your feedback and critique will be mostly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the font:\r\n\r\nI named it Reemenesque, which is
  a hybrid of my name and the word \u201CArabesque\u201D, an intricate design style
  that incorporates geometrical, flowery patterns.\r\n\r\nThe font is actually a hybrid
  of the Arabic alphabet and the English alphabet. Which has a very calligraphic style
  \ to it. The weight of the strokes are varied and there are two types of serif-like
  elements (inspired from Arabic font serifs) which decorate the font. One which is
  sharp and pointy, usually used on straight stokes. The other is a more decorative
  which is usually applied to the more curved areas of the font."

  body: It's a lovely idea - but I am not loving this execution. I don't think it
    does justice to either that latin alphabet or the arabic. I am sorry if this sounds
    harsh. I don't mean it to be. My suggestion is to look at the two traditions for
    longer and try again when you see them both more deeply.

  body: Some of the terminals are really great. They draw from arabic forms without
    looking like a fake arabic font. There could be more coherence or system in the
    stroke widths. Right now they feel random, but not on purpose. The other option
    would be to embrace the randomness and create two or three different designs for
    each character.

  body: "I agree with Christian.\r\n\r\nThe font looks very \"custom\". You should
    make more design variants of the same letters. You can see the problem already
    in the word \"REEMENSQUE\" put together with these letters. the first two \"E\"s
    are definitely problematic. Because they don't add variety. They look made up
    and unserious."

  body: Look at the thickness of some of your letters - the E form is too thick, as
    is the B and Q. The flow of the letters should not be stopped by heavy or different
    forms.

  body: "The idea is great, and some of the features are very promising, but yes this
    will need a great deal of change to end up \"good\", especially if your intent
    is producing a polished headline font, as opposed to an artsy \"grunge\" font.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"X\" and the \"R\" seems like the two glyphs of yours that are most worth looking
    at for guidance/evolution: the former because it's very close to a workable end-result;
    the latter because it contains (as it generally does actually) a large number
    of components that can be used in the font as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you're
    basing this on the Kufi style - which is a great idea. In that light, the main
    thing I would recommend is making the whole design much more rigid, much more
    horizontal. In that way, I can visualize this becoming a quite valuable contribution
    to type.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and please show us your progress!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    with the rest of the letters. Nice start though!
