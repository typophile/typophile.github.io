    which typefaces she has designed?

    it from this site and any of the other sites which have an similarly-interested
    readership. Where have you found homes for your previous reviews?

    reviews in a while. And I used to use Amazon for doing so. You know what would
    be great though? If TypeReview.com got back online. I once had a couple of font
    reviews there (Vendetta, Venis) and it could serve great for books too I think.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    hhp or Hrant are fine. Please.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
