  \r\nAnyone know the name of the font they use? Or do you have a suggestion for something
  similar?\r\nI kind of like www.dafont.com/ballpark-weiner.font\r\nBut I need something
  that feels more \"strict\" and have more of a feeling of speed.\r\nAny suggestions?\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n"

    and [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ballparkscript.php|Ballpark Script]].
    I think the lower case of Ephemera is most like your sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike

    Sport]], similar to Ballpark Weiner. But I'd really like to find the Campagnolo
    font, too.
