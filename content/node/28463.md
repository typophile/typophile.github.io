  too long to explain why I'm asking, but I will say that I'm not looking for quotes,
  just information (best guesses and range estimates are fine).\r\n\r\nAbout how much
  would it cost to have designed and printed a newsletter like the following:\r\n\r\n<cite>--
  11\" x 17\"\r\n-- 8-page tabloid-style (stapled)\r\n-- 4-color screenprinted (I
  don't think it's color laser)\r\n-- combining text and photo on a 3-column grid\r\n--
  on medium-weight uncoated (I think) stock\r\n-- 250 copies</cite>\r\n\r\nAnd (for
  those who got this far) what kind of discount comes with the scale of the run for
  something like this? (Forgive my clumsiness with any terminology.)"

    as printing, you won''t get any discounts for printing only 250. Most of printing
    cost is set-up fees. Are you sure this is to be "screenprinted"? '

  body: "Maybe I was being too indirect. Since I feel like I'm pretty safe here--none
    of the people involved are likely to be reading on this site--here's what I'm
    doing:\r\n\r\nI sit on a committee that is reviewing the status of one of my school's
    instructional divisions, and will probably ultimately be informing the search
    for a new director of said division. The current director is--to put it mildly--a
    bit reticent with information about among other things how much money the division
    is spending, but he is clearly spending it somewhat freely.\r\n\r\nAmong the targets
    of this spending is a newsletter he distributed to faculty and staff which I've
    got to believe is pretty pricey (the details as best I can describe them are in
    my initial post). I would like to know how much this thing cost, but I don't think
    asking the director outright will get us anywhere, since we're not his supervisors.
    To hunt the budget information down would be pretty time-consuming and would raise
    hackles. (Not that I'm against doing that, but I'm sure there's something in Sun
    Tzu's <em>Art of War</em> about not showing your opponent where your army is going.)\r\n\r\nI
    don't have a lot of time, and I thought that rather than bug local printers during
    their work hours for quotes on how much this newsletter would have cost, I would
    toss the question to Typophiles who are on their own time and who might toss out
    some estimates. Even a ballpark figure could tell us whether this is a big deal
    and worth looking into (even just for the information's sake) or not.\r\n\r\nI
    have to think the letter was designed out of house, since there's no one in the
    division as far as I know who could do it themselves, which is why I asked about
    design separate from printing. But if the design element is too slippery, even
    just rough estimates of printing costs would be helpful."

  body: Tim is absolutely correct; for a run of 250, don't even THINK about conventional
    printing if you want four-color. The job you describe can be done on a NexPress
    (or similar digital "press" -- acutally high-speed color copiers) for less than
    $500; conventional offset will cost at least three times as much.

    collective opinion I respect a great deal and whose members, type and graphic
    designers that they are, are likely to have much more experience with this stuff
    than I have.\r\n\r\nThus Nick's information was very helpful; that's exactly what
    I mean by \"ballpark.\" And your question is a good one. I doubt the thing was
    printed offset, but I honestly am not sure how I would tell just from looking.
    I can recognize inkjet, letterpress, and photocopying and less-expensive laser
    printing, but that's where my meager skills end. I know it's four-color and not
    process because I can see the colors in combination on the page."

  body: "Hi Maurice,\r\n\r\nAs several people have already said, to produce 250 copies,
    the quantity mitigates for digital printing. As a very general rule of thumb,
    somewhere between 500 and 1,000 copies, you should get a similar cost between
    digital and litho (which is the alternative, screen printing being another matter
    entirely).\r\n\r\nIt is also the case that design and origination costs would
    be much the same as for producing 250,000 copies.\r\n\r\nMaurice, don't hang your
    hat on this one. You don't know enough about it and we can't give any definitive
    answers. By all means get a phone quote from a local digital printer for an eight
    page newsletter this big - don't worry about stock etc., as it won't make a lot
    of difference on this quantity - get them to quote the best they have.\r\n\r\nThe
    design cost will largely be decided on who blinks first. If this is to be a pilot,
    design cost could be amortised. I expect that the designer (in a situation like
    this) is also producing the setting and artwork, the cost of which depend on loads
    of factors (photography, licenses etc), and client's revisions could exceed the
    original price in any case. \r\n\r\nI haven't done a newsletter in years, never
    enjoyed the experience or been that good at it, but I would do it for $10,000
    (50% up front, the rest now) for a bang-up job and my undivided attention. There
    are lots of good people who would do a great job, and then I could let you have
    a price for doing what they've done - but anybody can quote someone else's work,
    in retrospect and without actually having to produce it.\r\n\r\nBy all means question
    making the communication in this way, or at all - question the tactic - but there
    are good reasons for using printed words and pictures - just look at all the magazines
    about the internet.\r\n\r\nLastly, could I please be considered for the post of
    director of this division - I'm great at instruction and I could probably figure
    out what the job entailed within a few weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    my part, I agree with Darrel that newsletters should go out by email, so in that

    seems like it might have just as much to do with development as with information.

    printing only. One design quote of $10,000 was mentioned. (I'll do it cheaper.)\r\n\r\nMy
    point is that the design element of this kind of job is the biggest part of the
    price, and where you need to concentrate. It is going to cost from $1000 (which
    I expect would be the price from a student or raw beginner in the field) to well
    over the $10,000 quoted. \r\n\r\nI just don't want you to think that this is a
    $500 project because the printing costs are in that area."

  body: "We would probably charge in the range of $8k-$10k to design something like
    this. What you ahve to take into account is this: The intial design of such is
    going to be much more costly for the first issue. The following issue will be
    less since it is more production, and less design.\r\n\r\nI would estimate something
    more like $1,500 USD for the digital printing of this. (I'm think HP Indigo or
    DI press--it really depens on the quality. If you want cheap (looking) just go
    color laser). Bleed will play a large roll in this too. If you have margin, then
    you can print on an 11x17 sheet, if not you will have to print on 12x18 and trim
    down."
