body: "Hi guys, I would like to use this font for an important personal project. \r\nIt
  has got a good amount of glyphs, around 700. I like it because of its\r\nroughness,
  but I\u2019m not completely sure.\r\n\r\nCould you guys express your opinion about
  it?\r\nHave you any alternative for it?\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nAny doubts or strong
  opinion about it, will be well-accepted. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_ITAO-10005000_3736.GIF]"

  body: "As a book typeface it is really charming. I\u2019m just using it in a historical
    documentation but in a modern layout. The Italics are \u2013 well \u2013 Goudy-special,
    but interesting and eye-catching for headlines in body copy.\r\nGo for it if you
    like it.\r\nAn alternative would be Kennerly."

    What about something more, let\u2019s say well know. Like Grajon. What you think
    about it?\r\n "

    and up to this date probably the most widely used book typeface. It depends what
    you\u2019re after."

    looking for some alternative. Like Jenson pro, Maxime, Tundra FF. Stuff warm,
    venetian inspired. This kind of stuff. Italian old style seems to ha ve a terrible
    detail. "
