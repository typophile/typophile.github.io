  some kerning pairs. The problem is that when i generate a true type font file all
  kerning pairs are lost. After installing the suit font, when I type some text in
  freeHand (fe.: \"AV\") , The kernings are not adusted, and this is really desapointing.
  Maybe i am not creating the font file properly.\r\n\r\nSomeone please help me with
  this.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nThis is how i am generating the font file.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P2_5531.gif]"

  body: It's hard to tell for sure from the information you have provided (plus, I
    haven't used Fontographer for a while), but maybe you should select NFNT under
    "Bitmap font to output:". With Postscript fonts, the kerning is stored in the
    bitmap font. Perhaps Fontographer does not expect this to be set to "None" when
    generating Mac fonts--even TrueType fonts--and is not including the kerning for
    this reason. Just a guess.
