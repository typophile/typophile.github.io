  body: I can&#39;t decide what TIff is better at - being the original typegirl, or
    being a wonderful friend. Happy Birthday, little T - I hope it was a special day
    filled with joy, happiness, laughter, and lots of new shoes!

  body: Belated THANKS to all of you. I really REALLY appreciate all the love around
    here. As crazy as life can be and as busy as people can get--I probably say this
    too often--I can&#39;t imagine not having all of your interaction in my daily
    life. Here&#39;s to another year of spending too much time being a type geek!
