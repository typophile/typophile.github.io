  - I have two versions with differing \"L\"s:\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/kb6qyrI.png\"></img>\r\n\r\nSo,
  A or B? I feel pretty good with the \"Hus\" but I think that the \"tle\" still needs
  some working out. Additionally I'm aware of some of the Illustrator stroke issues
  with some jankiness that I'll attend to once I get the letter forms finalized.\r\n\r\nLet
  me know if you see any other problem areas or have suggestions to improve it.\r\nThanks!"
