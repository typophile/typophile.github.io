    target=\"_blank\">Univers</a>-like, and the numbers remind me of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=EF.116513.0.1\"
    target=\"_blank\">DIN</a>. Could be custom, based on Univers and DIN.\r\n\r\n

    them don't match.\r\n\r\nCould it be another fon't or do you think it's custom?"

  body: Nono. Not hinting at anything. Just a joke. I think it's fascinating that
    you go to such great lengths to match the jerseys for a console game and I commend
    it. Would love to play it when it's done.

    is already released. I was under the impression you were creating a new game.

    legal).\r\n\r\nSome of the people in the forums who make kits are so talented
    they really should be making games!"
