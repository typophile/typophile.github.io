<p>For a food chain, family-oriented / &ldquo;for the crowd&rdquo; kind of demographic, and I guess it will be in a certain shade of red (like ketchup.) Its commercial advertisments are usually depicting joy when being inside the establishment or patronizing their merchandise.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest? I am more leaning towards san serif typefaces since it is a tagline of sorts (can&rsquo;t say the tagline really, but something that in service with joy.)</p>
<p>Any help, guide and/or suggestions would be much appreciated!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">&ldquo;Happy&rdquo; is pretty subjective but I suppose it has about the same effect as cute, or rounded, and avoiding a sterile mechanical style like Helvetica. For a sans try Yummo <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/yummo/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/yummo/</a>
But why restrict your choices to a sans?
For example check out Laura Worthington&rsquo;s fat hybrid _Ganache _ <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/ganache/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/ganache/</a>
Or fairy tales handwritten roman letters like Besley Hand <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juraj-chrastina/besley-hand/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juraj-chrastina/besley-hand/</a>
Think outside the box.
BTW &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious&rdquo; seem to be incompatible as font criteria. But I can see &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and well designed as a great combination.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Strange – why does he want this to be &ldquo;serious&rdquo;? My only guess is he doesn&rsquo;t want it to look retarded-happy, like maybe this: <a href="http://media.chick-fil-a.com/Media/Img/catalog/Pressroom/ImageLibrary/logos/Chick-fil-A-logo-sm.jpg?download=true">http://media.chick-fil-a.com/Media/Img/catalog/Pressroom/ImageLibrary/logos/Chick-fil-A-logo-sm.jpg?download=true</a></p>
<p>In my view the main things that make a font friendly/happy are weight, width and a large x-height; it can have serifs, as long as their not delicate; and some controlled irregularity might help here too.</p>
<p>So what about this?

<p>Thank you for articulating it better, but I do think that is why the client went to ask help to get the idea to be well designed.</p>
<p>I think my client said &lsquo;serious&rsquo; because he wanted it to look as something presentable for corporate purposes, sort of consistency and legibility or cleanliness in the font. &lsquo;Happy&rsquo; can be associated to the roundness of the edges of the glyphs maybe or</p>
<p>Yummo &amp; Ganache do seem to have the looks but i dunno what to make of it. The former has its thickest weight still lacking in a little more weight and the latter leaning to whimsical. Even with these, I&rsquo;ll try to present it to the client. Thanks.</p>
<p>Any other opinions, comments and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Same sentiments to why he wants it &ldquo;serious,&rdquo; but I agree that the client does not want it retard-happy haha!</p>
<p>I agree with the weight &amp; width, but I think the x-height can still vary, really depends on the typeface. Anyway, I am not closing it only on sans serifs; just that I lean towards it more.</p>
<p>Swagg seems viable as an option too (especially the italics, which I haven&rsquo;t ventured in yet.) Thank you very much.</p>
<h2 id="for-both-hrant--donshottype">For both, @hrant &amp; @donshottype</h2>
<p>Also looking into other kinds of looks so yeah, outside-the-box thinking here as well.</p>
<p>Thank you thank you, but still open for more suggestions!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>The client wanted the usual typeface used in their previous output so even though most of you suggested well-designed typefaces, the client just used where he was comfortable. To all, thank you for helping me today. Have a great day!</p>
<p>Final EDIT:
Thank you for the following:
@J Weltin for suggesting Finnegan by Jürgen Weltin
@hrant for suggesting Swagg by Richard Miller
@donshottype for suggesting Yummo by Ryoichi Tsunekawa &amp; Ganache by  Laura Worthington</p>
