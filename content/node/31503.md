  body: Considering his stance towards 'modern' typedesign (eg the exclusion of reusing
    old typefaces) I dare to state that Luc[as] de Groot is the premier typographer
    (typedesigner) of this day and age.

  body: "I agree with Chris that it is misguided to try to name a \"#1\".\r\n\r\nThere
    are a lot of different ways to be excellent, and in the field of design there
    is a strong element of personal taste. --I can recognize excellence in styles
    that I don't personally like.  \r\n\r\nAs to Frutiger, he is certainly *one* of
    the best and the most influential type designers of the second half of the 20th
    century. However, I personally think this status rests on his sans serif faces;
    I don't find his serif faces either as ground-breaking or as exciting. "

    designer.\r\n\r\nHere a link for a french typography forum, I didn't got there
    and I came here because I want to learn english. \r\n<url>http://www.typographe.com/forum/</url>\r\n\r\nFor
    the french graphic designe forum I recommand this one <url>http://www.lalogotheque.com/forumde/index.php</url>,
    it's not the one I'am a member. The one I am a member, it's a real shame when
    come a new member and the atmosphere is not really good, and you are going to
    hate French people at my place.\r\n\r\nIf you go on those forum, you are going
    to see a guy called JMLEVY, Whit this guy you can ask anythink you want whit InDesign,
    he is a teacher of InDesign and also he make paste up (Maquette) on the greatest
    europeen magasine, and the guy is really gentle. He is my best body.  "
