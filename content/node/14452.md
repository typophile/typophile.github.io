  have any idea how to visually represent these two? Either separately or as a whole?
  This is proving to be difficult. ;)\r\n"

  body: "Actually what I am looking for is 'visual metaphores' for the words.\r\nFor
    example the word \"Exact\" may be represented better by sharp lines, fine points,
    etc., rather than circles or such. Are there things we think of visually, when
    we think of these words? I'm looking for abstracts, not type setting examples.
