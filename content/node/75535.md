body: "It looks like I have a little book coming up, at least parts of which I will
  be able to set unjustified (flush left, ragged right). That does make sense from
  the context of what it is; the texts it concerns are short, one to max four pages,
  interspersed with poetry too; and it's a small book where we're deliberately taking
  a few liberties with the layout.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm on the lookout for examples of
  books where such a setting was solved successfully. There are some potential pitfalls
  to this (and surely more than I can anticipate now, too), so I'd like to study how
  others have solved this <em>en d\xE9tail</em>. So if you can think of good examples
  for this, I'd be grateful for pointers! I'm preferably looking for recommendations
  of books that would be accessible via libraries etc., so I could see things like
  the show-through effect [which was briefly touched upon in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/75096\">this
  previous discussion</a>] in action.\r\nThanks."

    so exceptional? \r\nMost important: what language will it be set it? Cos in German
    you really have to work on good (and generous) hyphenation whereas in English
    some suggest to rather not have any at all. \r\nSecond most importantly: mind
    the paragraph composer or Indesign in general. Good for fast graphic design, but
    if you have a clear idea of how you want your lines to break and hyphenation it
    drives you nuts.\r\nWell, don't get me started\u2014I am very passionate about
    \xBBUmbruch machen\xAB, line breaks, hyphenation, avoidance of \xBBstaircases\xAB
    and other unintended forms of your \xBBSatzkante\xAB (seems we should move this
    discussion to a German speaking playground, I am missing the important English
    terms).\r\n"

  body: "Not sure whether the \u201Cstaircases\u201D I meant are called rivers in
    English (we call accumulating huge word spaces in justified text rivers, or rather
    creeks). I was referring to the form of the ragged right edge. I like to avoid
    any kind of strange, distracting shapes forming there, like staircases, triangle,
    holes and peaks etc. \r\n\r\nAlso try toprevent small words, or hyphenated parts
    from falling down at the end of a line. If there is no word under it in the line
    below, take it down into the next one. Best work with non-breaking word spaces
    here so that the line break vanishes when the text shall flows differently after
    a correction or something. Better not hyphenate after or before just two letters,
    at least not automatically. You can add those manually at places where you need
    them to elude a big hole. \r\nAnd last not least my favourite: avoid what (I think)
    Hochuli once called the swiss-erization of set text\u2014hyphenation after ...li-"

  body: "Hey thanks. (Also for pointing out those scripts, Florian!)\r\n\r\n<cite>\"is
    that something so exceptional?\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThat must depend on context I guess.
    I've mainly done novels and academic books so far, where rag-right would have
    been like, you want to do WHAT? :-)\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, it will be German. Actually
    Swiss orthography (which probably means extra caution about the \xABli\xBB! :-).
    I'm quite into working on a nice rag too (just haven't done it in <em>books</em>,
    where I am extra-wondering about things like the see-through effect, and extra-worrying
    that it has to look really nice). I like it to \xABoscillate\xBB nicely (and I
    would back an introduction of certain German terms into English! Like \xABFlattersatz\xBB).
    BTW, I do expect this will probably take more time than setting nice justified
    text.\r\n\r\nIt might be best to switch off hyphenation (and switch to the Single-Line
    Composer) and work entirely manually yes?"

  body: "Absolutely no worries, Nina. It doesn't take more time, nor do you have to
    be concerned about see-through issues unless you have really thin paper (what
    you probably won't have in a novel or the like). Just make sure you set the text
    registerhaltig (see, another one ... maybe I should switch to English in my layout
    programs to teach me) and that there isn't a major Flatterzone. If you want to
    have like a 10 mm margin left and right you should set the ragging right one to
    a smaller measure to optically fit. But it depends on how good you succeed in
    making the edge harmonious and even.\r\n\r\nBut, to save time, you should work
    with automated hyphenation switched on (take care of the settings!) and yes, single-line-composer,
    though even he won't do what you want in many annoying instances. Then go along
    the edge and check the hyphenations and manually adjust for better breaks (no
    hard hyphens), undo unpleasant ones, wrap small words or parts to the next line
    etc.\r\nWorking manually is possible also, but really time consuming for longer
    text, and you have to read a good part of it to hyphenate appropriately."

  body: "Well, the margin thing depends on how big they are in general and how much
    you adjust them. It's more for the optical evening out so you shouldn't have whole
    words hanging over. But otherwise the hard line from the other side could look
    quite far away. I just do it like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/margins_5658.png]\r\n\r\nStill
    I don't think this is going to me a major issue, the paper won't be that thin.
    Also people are used to see things shine through a bit from the other side, they
    won't hate the book just because of that. Not meeting the baseline grid is far
    far more disturbing.\r\nAnd keep in mind that the printer still can spoil every
    noch so carefully thought out positioning :)\r\n\r\n\r\n((Ah, books: Well, I did
    a lot of text-heavy books for Rowohlt et al you don't want to know about (baby
    care, popular science, lifestyle crap, sports, song books :) It's hard to come
    up with some titles\u2014the architecture books and artist catalogues I do don't
    really have long columns of text, Helvetica Forever I didn't typeset and my type-book
    has an asymmetric layout, the Puutikkala book will be impossible to find for you,
