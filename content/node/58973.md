  body: "Hi Arran,\r\n\r\nalthough, at first sight, the bold cut of Scangraphic's
    Grotesk looks quite similar overall (more so than Schulbuch), it's not it either
    (the most striking difference is the G, but other characters don't match either).\r\n\r\nHave
    you searched the booklet for info on the font?\r\n\r\nI went to their website
    (http://typeneu.com/size-format-stock) and found that it's quite aptly named:
    <em>An Odyssey in Typography</em>. I could stay there for only about 20 seconds,
    as my patience didn't last any longer and I sensed a serious headache coming.
    So if you can, try browsing the site yourself.\r\n\r\nIn case that nobody can
    ID your sample, and as you have the booklet at hand, could you take a straight,
    frontal close-up of the font? It's hard to recognize the finer details of the
    type at 15 pixel height, like in your photo.\r\n\r\nJens"

  body: Hi Jens, thanks for your response on this. I have managed to find out from
    the person behind the booklet (though not the designer) that the font is called
    Mobil. This would suggest that it is the brand font for Mobil and thus a modified
    version of Avant Garde? Ive done a basic google for it, but nothing comes up.
    Would be great to know if its commercially available. Perhaps ill post a message
    about this in a more suitable thread later...
