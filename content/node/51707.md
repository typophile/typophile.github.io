body: "I'm in the process of design my school year book. I've got several parameters
  that need following and I am looking for some advice/ guidance. The document is
  normally around 200 pages. A4 portrait. 3 column. Around 800 images, full colour.
  The school font is Times New Roman... I know, I know but dont have to use it throughout
  doc. Last year I used verdana main body with a fair degree of success. Just because
  its for web and commercial print. I'm looking some help choicing some fonts that
  work well together. Either a serif title with a san for body text. or the other
  way around. I'd also like your thoughts on the navigating bar which will be colour
  coded (the year book has around 25 sections) and footer (the school and yearbook
  title)\r\n\r\ngreatly appreciated\r\n\r\nGareth\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pages-from-shamal2009-2_3455.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pages-from-shamal2009-5_3525.jpg]"

  body: "Gareth,\r\nIt is very  heavy looking and the text is chopped up uncomfortably
    in the first page.\r\nAlso, I think you have way too many typefaces going without
    clear reasoning. You need white space and some clarity to help the reader.\r\n\r\nChrisChrisL"

  body: "I wasn't planning on using all the fonts together. just trying to find a
    good pairing. serif for title and smaller for sub and possibly captions. And then
    a san for main text body.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nGareth"
