body: Hi folks! I am looking for a bit more information on Postscript drawing to help
  me troubleshoot my current font. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12179.gif"
  alt="Here&#39;s a picture of the problem."> <BR> <BR>As you can see, I have a few
  long, thin, unwanted lines across a few glyphs, i.e., 2, 7, 0, A, B, F, G, H, Q,
  R, U, W, X, Y, Z. Somewhere I picked up that those are called &#39;rays&#39;. <BR>
  <BR>I understand that rays can be caused by open paths, overlapping points, lack
  of extrema or crossing BCP handles, but I can find none of those things in these
  &#40;albeit extremely complex&#41; glyphs. <BR> <BR>Anything else I can look for
  to fix? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance! <BR> <BR>p.s. When printed or rendered anti-aliased,
  they disappear, but of course I want them to look right everywhere, y&#39;know?

  body: This is &#34;spiking&#34; caused by having an inordinate number of points
    in each character, or by having points on top of points &#40;sometimes consecutive,
    sometimes not&#41;. The way to get rid of spiking is to drastically reduce the
    number of vertices in your outlines, and especially make sure that there aren&#39;t
    any points sitting on top of each other. <BR> <BR>Often the spiking disappears
    when printing, or when anti-aliased, as you mention. But it&#39;s not a sure thing,
    by any means. Spiking can show up in printed documents at unpredictable times.

  body: Thanks, Alan! <BR> <BR>Do you know how many points is a good limit to prevent
    spiking? <BR> <BR>And does anybody know if FontLab can report the number of points
    in a glyph? <BR> <BR>Cheers.

  body: I always try to stay under 300, even that is extremely rare and really pushing
    it. Thought it&#39;s my understanding that the real limit is around 1000 points.
    <BR> <BR>If you select the outlines in FontLab and right-click, then go to &#34;Properties&#34;,
    it will tell you how many outlines and points you have selected. Or if nothing
    is selected, you&#39;ll get window showing more info about the character, which
    also includes the number of points in the glyph &#40;the first number in the upper
    left part where all the little numbers are&#41;. <BR> <BR>You can also turn on
    FontAudit in FontLab to see if there are any point sitting on top of each other.

  body: 'After all, I found that 95% of the time, the spikes would go away when I
    deleted these tiny little shapes with very few points.  <BR> <BR>Maybe it has
    to do with the tiny angle of the curve handles? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s an example:

  body: That&#39;s one good way to prevent the spiking. Too many of those tiny shapes
    might be more than the rasterizer can handle. <BR> <BR>But also look at the structure
    of that little shape. It&#39;s breaking a few of the rules for Bezier drawing,
    so that could be it, too. It also looks like one of its points is sitting on top
    of a point on the other path. <BR> <BR>Ultimately, I think the idea is that Type
    1 fonts weren&#39;t meant to be so incredibly complicated, so it sometimes freaks
    out when you push it too far. <BR> <BR>Alan
