  described a regular sans font that he told me looked 'shattered'\r\n\r\nI suggested
  ITC Shatter (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/shatter/) but he said it was
  more 'subtle' and prepared a mock-up, which I have attached\r\n\r\nCan anyone help
  with a font that looks something 'in between' the two?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nH-NX_\r\n"
