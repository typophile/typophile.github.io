body: "Hi, i'm a complete beginner at font design, and to get me started i am experimenting
  with drawing the glyphs and autotracing into illustrator.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know
  your process when making this type of font. Do you manipulate the glyphs much in
  illustrator/fontlab or do you leave them as they are? In particular i am finding
  that i have very rough edges from the pen when i zoom in. Many handmade fonts i
  have seen don't have this. Is the best way round this to adjust the individual nodes
  to smooth out the edges?\r\n\r\nthanks for any input..."

    paper and then redraw from scratch in Illustrator using a grid. Sometimes I will
    trace over a scan.\r\n\r\nHave you got the [[http://www.nineblock.com/products.html|Better
    Handles]] plug-in for Illustrator?\r\n\r\nLeslie Cabarga's book the \"Logo, Font
    & Lettering Bible\" lives up to its name for me.\r\nSearch for the ISBN:  0715316990\r\n\r\nAlso
    have a go at [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/|Fontstruct]], for a very different
    approach which can then be adapted to Illustrator, or indeed your Fontstruct fonts
    can be tweaked in Illustrator if you convert your text to outlines."

    Tip is a regular here. You could try PM-ing him for advice.

  body: You might want to try autotracing directly in Fontlab. Between setting tweaks
    and the optimize tool your letters will have far fewer points than they will when
    you trace in Illustrator and things will require much less cleanup that way.
