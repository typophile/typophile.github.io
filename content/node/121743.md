body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/upload_4995.jpg]\r\n\r\nI need help identifying
  the type 'CHARGE' is in. I used it a few years ago and have since then misplaced
  my original ID files. Turns out we're using this old project for a newer web project
  and I'm lost on w hat this could be. Have tried countless other type ID sites. Please
  help!\r\n\r\nI'm also searching for the script type right below it. Really hating
  myself today for not having kept better track of those files."
