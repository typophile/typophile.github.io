		<div class="commentbody">&#62;I think that you&#39;ve done a lovely job with the letters - maybe the E &#62;could be moved in a bit so that it is more visually ending at the &#62;same line as the s? It is a strange contrast though - such elegant &#62;type and a word like FORGE? Not sure what to make of that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice typeface selection for the word ellipsis. I would suggest trying a sans face for the word forge. I agree with am, it currently looks a little to elegant. Using a sans serif face for &#34;forge&#34; may create some contrast between the 2 words. Also, tightening up the space between the &#34;e&#34; and the &#34;l&#34; will definately help. NIce logo overall though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is at least some weight problems between heavy e s and others letters. The e don&#39;t fit very well with the rest. The weight structure of it is quite different from p, perhaps use same way to built them. &#40;oblique axis of e compared to vertical axis of p&#41;. Dots of the i are little too close. <BR> <BR>And Forge will be indeed better in a Sans, perhaps better little more far from the bottom of the baseline of the ellipsis word.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The stress is different. Perhaps change the &#39;p&#39; to the same stress as the others, narrow up the &#39;e&#39;. Another thought... perhaps you forego the separation of the letters in &#34;forge&#34; also. Simplify the design by placing the word forge &#40;together, but still spaced a bit&#41; to the right of the descender on the &#39;p&#39;. --- And, what if the dot over the &#39;i&#39; was more of a lozenge shape?? Too much??</div>

		<div class="commentbody">ask the client if you can give him advice on <BR>his metalwork. ha. he&#39;s pretty much outvoted <BR>on matrix. i think ellipsis does well at <BR>giving off a hand-crafted vibe. historical even. <BR>since the one word is historical, maybe you <BR>could convince him to go  little more modern <BR>on the other word. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m in the minority here, but separating the <BR>fo from orge looks kind of cool to me. i can <BR>see it both ways, but as it is gives it a sort <BR>of violent, manly feel. you know, working with <BR>metal, sweating, beating out a heavy piece of art. <BR>maybe it&#39;s just me.</div>
