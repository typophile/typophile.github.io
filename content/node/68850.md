body: "I just released Tempest, a headline serif font in MyFonts, but while I worked
  on that, I wanted to make a more playful, whimsical little brother for it. \r\n\r\nSome
  glyphs still need work, and kerning is just in it's infancy, but you get a feel
  for the font here:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tournedot_4074.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  thinking of making some alternate glyphs; a and g are done already. I used them
  on the pdf, so you can see them there.\r\n\r\nI started with a serif design, but
  veered off pretty quick; Tournedot needed something different, so I turned it into
  a semi sans with pretty galligraphic tones going on with V, v, W, w, A, M and so
  on.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

  body: "I really like this. \r\n\r\n/g/ and /y/ are quite off-kilter. They jump out
    to me, but at the same time they also pleasingly reinforce the bounciness of the
    font.\r\n\r\nI don't think the /a/ extended intersection works as well as /e/'s.\r\n\r\n/M/
    looks weak to me in the upper left.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there's a way around the
    almost-crash of \"Fu\" (in \"full character set\"). I can imagine the low-hanging
    serif of /T/ posing a similar problem. \r\n\r\nThe subtle swellings of the lines
    are attractive.\r\n\r\nCharming stuff!"

  body: "Thanks for the input, Craig-\r\n\r\nYes, those g and y do jump out, but that
    was my intention, and that a-extension is still at try-out stage. T and F serifs
    do extend a bit too much. And I'll go through the whole character set to see any
    thin/thick points.\r\n\r\nAnd ligatures are still under production, as well as
    kerning pairs; there's less than 200 of the buggers, so it's clear that there's
    still work ahead."

  body: "This is a lot of fun, and clearly very refined. I love the /g/.\r\n\r\nI
    think the single-story /a/ works better than the double, but part of that is because
    the double is too narrow by just a bit. Come to that, the /s/ might need widened
    a tad as well... Like Eliason, I'm not sure if the extended intersection is working
    super well on the /a/ but it's not bad.\r\n\r\n/i/ and /r/ seem very slightly
    heavier than the rest. I think it's that they don't have the same stroke variance
    as some of the other characters. I'm looking at them amid /n/s and /h/s and the
    like, and when I cover up the the curved parts I can see the stems are the same.
    But having that thin part makes the character seem lighter as a whole. I doubt
    you could bring that into the /i/, but you might shave a hair's breadth off the
    side to compensate. As for the /r/, you probably could increase the stroke disparity.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    I notice that you have two different styles of serif, one of which has a couple
    of sharp(ish) corners and the other of which is more curved. For the most part,
    I think these have been used appropriately, but I would switch them on the tops
    of the /I/ and /i/. The /I/ is very easy to mistake for an /l/, and I would expect
    a capital letter to have the slightly more formal \"bent\" serif. This would also
    segregate them by height (bent serifs up at cap-height level, curvy ones at x-height)
    which would seem to make sense. This is all just my instincts talking, however.\r\n\r\nVery
    nice work. I especially like the punctuation!"

  body: "Thanks, Tristan-\r\n\r\nHappy to hear that you like my font.\r\n\r\nI tried
    a and s wider, but they looked out of place, and had to come back with them. That
    a extention I just had to do; otherwise e was just a fad. (Well, I did use it
    in P and R as well).\r\n\r\nI tried to make i to look lighter, but it just went
    too far with even a slight chance, so I left that as it was.\r\n\r\nUpper case
    has different height from ascenders, so serifs can be playful as well.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments. Happy to see that people really look at my stuff."
