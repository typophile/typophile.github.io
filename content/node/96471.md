    name \"Basic Commercial\"?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/\r\n\r\n(I
    thought of this because the numbers are basically indistinguishable from Helvetica.
    But that's not the Helvetica R.)"

  body: "the digits could be set in a different font, in fact they look to me like

    Condensed Light]]</strong>\r\nthe rest of text looks close to <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/formula/|Formula
    TS-Regular]]</strong> + a bit of compression\r\nThis combination of /C/G/E/R/S/
    seems to be really rare and unique..."
