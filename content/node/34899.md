body: "Gohan is a font I came up with back in 2001, just as an exercise in making
  a heavyweight sans font with some idea about some sort of optical properties inspired
  by an article I read about a font called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/gararond-bold/|Gararond]].
  Well what resulted probably had nothing to do with the ideas that inspired it but
  it did turn out to be a very bold font that held up remarkably well at small sizes.
  Still, it had many deep flaws, and clearly was not ready for prime time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2205_5970.big.png]\r\n\r\nSo
  now I'm taking it upon myself (in the interest of getting used to using FontForge
  instead of my old reliable Fontographer as much as anything) to redesign much of
  the font, and once that is covered, to develop book and medium weight versions.
  \r\n\r\nThe original is available for free at [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2205|1001
  Fonts]]. Works in progress are in the attached PDF files below.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I found a better link for the [[http://www.quiresiste.com/projet.php?id_projet=55&id_gabarit=0&lang=en|Gararond]]
    if anybody is interested. I don't want my italic to be quite so variable though.

    wrong here?"

  body: I enjoy the original "8", have you considered working the "thin-ness" into
    the other glyphs?

  body: "You'll see a similar thinness in the e, cent, \xD8 and \xF8. I too like how
    it looks in the 8 on its own, but it stands out too much amongst the rest of the
    font, so I've changed it in the revision. \r\n\r\nAs I'm progressing through the
    plain weight, I may have to go back and change more things in the bold to keep
    them consistent. I only have a few more letters to go in the plain, so a new sample
    should be up before too long."

    click "submit"... And it'll upload you new attachment.
