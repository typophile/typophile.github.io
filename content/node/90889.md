  they want me to come in for an interview.\r\nThe bad news is that my normal printed
  portfolio is the same as that .pdf.\r\n\r\nHow different do they have to be? My
  portfolio is full of smaller projects and illustrations. Nothing's really been printed,
  and I don't have any books."

  body: "I call it pragmatic design even though it's really me just being lazy, but
    my portfolio has always been a PDF file. When I go into an actual interview, I'll
    print the PDF out on a color laser printer and add a cover.\r\n\r\nI'll typically
    load it up on the iPad or laptop as well.\r\n\r\nSo, they're rarely different.
    At times, depending on the gig, I may edit the portfolio a bit pulling out certain
    projects or adding others, but I don't explicitly put different content on the
    PDF I send vs. what I bring in for the face-to-face.  "

  body: If they called you for an interview is because your work is good and they
    want to know more about you. Grab a printed copy of your PDF portfolio just in
    case they want to go trough it again but now it is more important for you to sell
    yourself than your work.
