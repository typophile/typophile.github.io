body: 'I&#39;m very excited to have just received InDesign CS in the mail. I&#39;d
  been holding off because my principal print design these days requires me to work
  with someone who refuses to switch from Quark. The reason he gives is that his firm
  handles a lot of print work in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, and he&#39;s
  afraid that moving to InDesign will make his life harder. <BR> <BR>At this point,
  I&#39;m prepared to keep working in Quark 4.1 in Classic to accommodate him, but
  I&#39;m not happy about it. I&#39;m super-tired of Quark 4.1 in Classic, despite
  having just paid $30 for a utility that &#40;finally&#41; displays my fonts kind
  of the way ATR used to, though much more slowly. <BR> <BR>From now on I&#39;ll be
  using Indy for everything else. Buh-bye, Quark, nice knowing you, don&#39;t let
  the door hit you on the way out. <BR> <BR>So, those of you who know about using
  Indy for languages other than English, I have two questions: <BR> <BR>1. Can I convince
  him that switching to Indy will be relatively painless and actually improve his
  workflow in the long run? <BR> <BR>2. If he still refuses to switch, how easy is
  it to go back and forth between Quark 6 and Indy CS?'

  body: Hi Dave, <BR> <BR>I am dubious that the switch would be relatively painless.
    I&#39;m not even certain that it is practical today. <BR> <BR>InDesign uses a
    Unicode text engine. So he&#39;d have to switch from a workflow using non-Unicode
    text to one using Unicode. <BR> <BR>Spanish wouldn&#39;t be a problem &#40;ID
    ships with Spanish dictionaries and hyphenation right out of the box&#41;. Depending
    on the level of typographic finesse and his need for vertical text, Chinese could
    require having the Japanese version of the product, and/or the third-party &#34;InChinese&#34;
    plug-in. Korean I&#39;m not so sure about--just my ignorance here. <BR> <BR>Vietnamese
    could be a real problem, since it&#39;s a &#34;complex script&#34; requiring support
    for some fancy shaping rules. Current versions of InDesign really don&#39;t support
    Vietnamese. <BR> <BR>Of course, I have no idea how well QXP works in these areas.
    How does he do Vietnamese in QuarkXPress, for instance? <BR> <BR>There&#39;s an
    article by Diane King on multilingual publishing in InDesign, that was posted
    by CreativePro.com. It has lots of info in this area. You could also try the InDesign
    mailing list on BlueWorld.com, or the InDesign user forum on Adobe.com. <BR> <BR>Hope
    that&#39;s of some help. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Very helpful, thanks -- not sure how easy it is for him to do multiple languages
    in QXP, but he does them fairly regularly, and it&#39;s an effective enough solution
    that he can generate PDFs ok &#40;the Chinese PDFs are enormous compared to the
    other languages&#41;, and he outputs to printers/service bureaus just fine. I&#39;ll
    monitor those sites to see when the water is warm enough.
