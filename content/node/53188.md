  body: Yes, you're right, it's different weights of [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/gdnegyp.shtml|Guardian
    Egyptian]], not yet available for licencing.

    Schwartz's other font [[http://www.vllg.com/Schwartzco/Stag/mudTyper+Weights/|Stag]]
    though that may be a bit on the fat side. \r\nOthers in a similar style:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/oranda/|Oranda]]\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/olsen/|FF
    Olsen]]\r\nMore slabby:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/primetype/qugard-slab/|Qugard
    Slab]]\r\nPerhaps [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/zine-slab/|FF Zine]]"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I like Olsen if it had a bit more of a heavy weight.
    The Guardian's heavier weights look beautiful to me -- just the right mix of casual
    and slab I was looking for. I'll spec out these others and see how they work.
    I appreciate the help!

  body: I do like Stag. For my budget I'll probably only be able to do light and bold
    -- the black is a little too thick compared to what I was looking for.  I hate
    when I get my mind set on a particular font. I'll definitely be on the lookout
    if Guardian becomes available down the road.

  body: Just wanted to give folks an update that Christian contacted me to say that
    Guardian Egyptian is available. He has the details. He has been a pleasure to
    work with and I'm excited to be able to use this for my original project.

    it's me? There's nothing to click."
