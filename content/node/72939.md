  a year ago I started thinking of new font names, er...a theme of different font
  names for a different family of different styles :P At last, Beefcakes is in the
  final stages and is scheduled for release on August 20th, w00t! It is the first
  of the \"Cakes\" series, a collection of display fonts inspired by various brush
  lettering styles. The series will include Beefcakes, Babycakes, Hotcakes, Paddycakes
  and Sweetcakes, and as each typeface is unique (not to mention time-consuming to
  draw!) they will be released as they're finished...\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nJim\r\n\r\n\r\nBeefcakes,
