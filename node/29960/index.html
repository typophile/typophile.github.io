  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I’m working on a design of a menu (also called an “end plate”) for television and I was wondering how fellow members felt about writing and reading date + time on TV and the legibility issue. On rare occasions, at the end of the “promo” we have to put a title of the show, specific date in the month & time. This end plate/ menu appears usually for about 4-5 sec with the reviling of the type, so this information stays on usually fully revealed for about 3 sec. So, you can see there is definitely a challenge in delivering it, as this message must be as concise as possible. Also, one thing I should mention that devices like “dot” and “commas” don’t work that well on TV as they tend to disappear.  So, here are some ways of doing it:

Example


1
Name of the show
December 10  9 PM E/P

2
Name of the show
December 10 / 9 PM E/P

3
Name of the show
December 10TH -  9 PM E/P

4
Name of the show
10 December  9 PM E/P

5
Name of the show
December 10
9 PM E/P




As you can see the, the first objective is to convey the date, and the time is the secondary message. The title of the show is about 30-36 points and could appear in two lines and the date & time is about 22 points (usually in different color). The typeface is your regular sans-serif and the TV channel is in North America.

First, here I my thoughts on it and please feel free to give me your opinion and suggestions. 

1
This example is quite common on TV, but is quite problematic, because even if we put a couple of spacing between the day & time, they tend “merge” and became unreadable altogether. However, many people would argue that is a the way the average person would read the date here in North America.

2
This case is quite similar to 1 and has similar problems.

3
Is a solution in a way to 1&2, but becomes quite lengthy, and 10+TH could impair the reading in a way.

4
Is a solution I personally favor, however critics would say that “this is not the way people would usually read the date in North America”. However, I believe that the way brain perceives this information and reading it is quite different thing. 

5
Could be a solution to 1,2,3 & 4, however it alters the overall design of the message and can appear quite overwhelming.


I’m really sorry about this lengthy post, but I would really appreciate member’s opinion & insight on this issues. I believe it is a simple legibility issue, meaning which message would be clearer in less than 3 sec. Also, I’m sorry I can’t reveal the name of the network as it could get in trouble. Thanks very much,

Jennifer

I guess my topic is not as interesting as “designers have a huge role to play in society”. Ironically, these details actually affect millions of people who watch TV, but we tend to care less about it than the printed medium I guess. 

Anyway, any comments are welcome, you don’t need to be an expert. Thanks !

		<div class="commentbody">solution #4 -- this would be problematic because the 9 that follows December does read at the date as well as does the 10 which precedes. 

solution #5 -- even if this appears to be more wordy it does help reading more. 

I'd guess a lot of the problem solving will be in how you set the type. Could you share samples?

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jennifer. I have a strong attraction to 5 and here's why: I think it takes a long time to parse the others when more than one thing is happening on a line. I don't know if an en-dash (or even a bullet) with space on either side would be more quickly taken in than a slash, but even though 5 goes to three lines, each line is its own topic in a sense. So as I look them over, I keep feeling that the gestalt of the three simple lines enters my brain faster than the two more complex lines -- I don;t have to slow down and figure out what's happening when it changes from date to time. Does this make any sense?

or

This way you are clearly breaking up formatting between the date, and you make sure the hour can't be mistaken for a date.

Also put the 'th' as a superscript. People might not read it, but I'm sure they'll unconsciously accept the symbol for either a 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th'.</div>

Would be my preference because it separates the numerals, although it does change your hierarchy of the information. I have an imaginary conversation in my mind, ‘when is so-and-so on?’, ‘9 o’clock on December 10th’ (I must stop having these conversations).

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Pierre, showing time in the proper format as opposed to dropping the “:00” would make it read better. I would leave the  ”th” out, as people already read dates that way without the extra letters. And unless there's a shortage of space, just spell out ”Eastern/Pacific.” It's one thing to abbreviate in print where people have time to figure things out, but people who read or think slowly might not figure the E/P out fast enough to notice it at all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone ! It definitely gives me something to think about. It seems like #5 seems to strike a consensus. Also, Pierre suggestion of adding :00 helps a lot and at the same time does not alter overall design.

So modified #3 & #5 would look as following:

3
Name of the show
December 10th, 9:00 PM E/P

5
Name of the show
December 10th
9 PM E/P     (or 9:00 PM E/P)



I’ll try to answer some of the question:

Unfortunately, in television, broadcast designers set & design templates, but it’s editors/credit producers that actually do this stuff on daily basis and they usually have very little or no knowledge of typography. As a result, they hardly every kern words/letter and the best they can do is add more spacing, so it’s quite “crude” process.

Secondly, the tools they use does not allow them to use “en dash” or “superscript”, so the “th” would have to be either lower case of upper case only. E/P is means Eastern & Pacific time, meaning the show would be airing at the same time in both of these time zones. E/P has to be abbreviated due to luck of space.

Anyway, thanks for all the suggestion. I find it very refreshing to hear it from people outside of TV, as TV people are usually biased towards certain solution...

what about the announcer? will the titles be accompanied by an announcer? 

If you have "a lot of text"  go with #5 (see for example TBS):
Name of the show
December 10
9 PM E/P

If not--
Name of the show
sunday 9/8
