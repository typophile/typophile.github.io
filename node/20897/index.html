I too, thought it was hand lettered the first time I looked at it with the asymetrical "A's" and the bugling bottom curve of  the "O's", and it is very beautiful. But when I look very closely at it, it just feels "set" to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the old days, when they did lithographed posters like this, they did not use type at all. Everything--even small print--was done by hand. It was not like it is now when practically anything that looks like type almost always is. There were, in fact, practical reasons why they did not use type. 

First, type was available only in specific sizes, up to about an inch tall for metal, larger for wood. Even so, if the type was a little too big or too small, tough luck. Theoretically, you could photograph the type and enlarge or reduce it, but that was too complicated and expensive at the time. Instead, there was a whole army of lettering artists ready to step in whenever you wanted greater control over how your letters looked, including the simple (to us) case of making them fit nicely into a layout. These people became all but obsolete when phototype, stat cameras, and offset printing became the norm. 

Second (and more important), posters like this were made by drawing or painting the art actual size onto lithographic stone. (Hint: lith = stone, graph = draw). You couldn't use metal or wood type to put letters on a lithographic stone because the surface is hard and smooth. Type was designed to work with the soft, absorbent surface of paper. Even if you could have used type, the image would be backwards from what you need. The art on lithographic stones had to be wrong-reading so that when it was transfered to paper it would be right-reading. Type printed onto stone would thus be backwards from what was needed.

Sorry for the lecture, but I sense that there seems to be somewhat of a lack of knowledge concerning graphic arts history here.

Short answer: Most letters on posters made before the 1950s were done by hand, even when it looks an awful lot like type.</div>

For future font-finding reference, myfonts.com has a really nifty font-identification app called "Whatthefont."

You upload a jpeg of the font, walk it through identifying the letters themselves, and then it tries to match it based upon its database of known fonts. It hasn't failed me yet.
