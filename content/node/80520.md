  body: You can sometimes get cleaner conversions if you scale up the outlines by
    a factor of 10 first and then rescale them back down to the original size after
    the conversion. Ideally, the conversion routine would come with tolerance options,
    in the same way that bitmap tracing does, so one could say whether one wanted
    a tighter fit to the cubic bezier shape or a fewer number of off-curve points.
    A quadratic clean-up tool such as you describe would need to work the same way,
    I reckon, with user input on tolerances, so it might as well be part of the conversion
    routine. Note how, in your outline there are some curves that can have the number
    of off-curve points reduced by half with minimal loss of fidelity, while other
    curves require the same number of points as in the original conversion; this means
    that decisions need to be made about how much deviation from the original shape
    is permitted, i.e. tolerances.

    technique didn't help you, James. I think much depends on the curves in question,
    rather than a generic method that works the same way for all glyphs/fonts. I suspect
    scaling would be a good step to incorporate into an improved conversion routine,
    though, as it will enable better fidelity to the cubic bezier curves, especially
    smaller details where rounding during conversion at lower UPMs can cause really
    bad distortions."

    straight line between to on curve points, to a perfectly sharp apex). Start digging.

    a minimum of two hundred days of your life doing this, and likely very much longer.
    Wouldn't you at least like to have a tool that does, say, 80% of that work for
    you, so that you only need to check most of the results and only edit a small
    proportion of the converted curves? Weren't computers supposed to make us more

    is. And two years after you wrote that fewer TT segments are indeed more, I finally
    got it and agree. The key is to consider TT outlines as master and resist the
    temptation to mimick PS outlines. (Reminds me of trying to mimick IK outlines
    with PS outlines earlier.) The fewer segment, the easier it is to avoid quirky
    curves.\r\n\r\nAll that is needed is a good TT outline editor. I hope that FL
    has made some progress beyond just having \"recognized improving this functionality
    a priority\". :)\r\nIn addition to my earlier wishlist: Accepting the restriction
    that only two off-curve points are permitted, the TT editing behavior could almost
    entirely reflect PS editing behavior. Grant TT on-curve points \"smooth\" behavior
    too. And that non-horizontal & non-vertical off-curve points, via shortcut, retain
    their angle when moving them toward or away from the next on-curve point.\r\n"

    (which should behave identically to a T1 editor except for the \"completeness

    don't you think they'll want changes to the TT hinting tools? And when that's
    fixed up, they'll want a glyph instruction template and feature-to-Nyquist Limit
    \"equalizer\"? and then control point number-independent labels for glyph features?

    use for achieving a requested precision is increasing the number of segments.**
    What (see D.B.'s premise) is asked for, however, is achieving sufficient precision
    while producing a fixed number (two) of off-curve nodes inbetween two on-curve
    nodes, which in turn asks for an alternative method to maintain precision that
    differs from that used by both FontForge and FLS. Put differently: Possibility
    to adjust a precision factor does not help if the precision factor feeds the wrong
