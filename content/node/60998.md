  body: "[[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm|Dieter
    Steffmann]] is one person who has revived many of these vintage ornamental typefaces.
    Sometimes he changes their names, and his page doesn't display them in an overview.
    Dan Solo of Solotype has also revived many in digital form in recent years, but
    not sure about this particular typeface. A somewhat similar type is [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/rakowski/dr5/davy_f5.htm|Showboat]],
    which is an alias name I'd guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    serif. It is often mixed with tuscan serifs.
