  body: "No, it\u2019s not difficult to convert them. But it is very difficult to
    become aware of that problem \u2013 if you aren\u2019t confronted with it. There
    are browsers that simply don\u2019t care about CMYK, so how are their users supposed
    to do so? To detect the colour mode of a web image, I\u2019d have to download
    it, locate it on my disk, select \u2018Information\u2019, and additionally, select
    \u2018Further information\u2019.  4 steps, only for finding out, i.e. without
    conversion? No dice, Jan, sorry. :-)"
