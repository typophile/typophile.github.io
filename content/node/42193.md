body: "hi all,\r\n\r\ni'm currently reading 'hidden empire' by kevin j. anderson,
  it's a science fiction novel.\r\n\r\nthe edition is have is a pocket books one,
  with this on the inside about the typesetting:\r\n\r\n<cite>'Typeset in Weiss by
  SX Composing DTP, Rayleigh, Essex. Printed and bound in Great Britain by Cox and
  Wyman Ltd, Reading, Berks.\"<cite/>\r\n\r\ni can't recall ever seeing weiss before
  this book, and while i think it is a very nice typeface, it seems almost too beautiful
  to be used as a text face. i'm not sure exactly what is causing me problems, except
  the lower case 'z' which i think is quite nice and always make me stumble as i pause
  to admire it. \r\n\r\ndo any of you know what i'm talking about?\r\n\r\nare there
  better example of where weiss really works?\r\n\r\namazon.co.uk have some sample
  pages [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-Empire-Saga-Seven-Suns/dp/0743430654/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203307627&sr=8-2|here]]\r\n\r\ncheers

  body: "I myself don't recall ever seeing a novel set in Weiss. But Stefan Hattenbach's
    <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/anziano.asp\">Anziano</a> was partly
    inspired by Weiss, and he seems to have appreciated Weiss in a novel according
    to the blurb on the site:\r\n\r\n<cite>In 2004, he purchase a first edition of
    the Swedish version of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (1959-1961) and was amazed
    by the excellent flow and presentation of the text on each page. He realized that
    several major foundries had already done interpretations of Weiss - all of which
    were more or less true to the original. He didn\u2019t want to add to that list.
    Instead, Stefan has tried to find his own path with Anziano and hopefully people
    will think that the design lives on its own.</cite>"

  body: "maybe i'm just used to reading old sci-fi books from the 50's and 60's which
    tend to use either times or plantin. \r\n\r\nanziano looks great in the sample,
    but i would love to see it set with more text.\r\n\r\ni'm almost finished the
    book and for the most part weiss has not hindered me too greatly, but i am noticing
    it, where as in the past i don't think i have paid too much attention to the typeface.
    \r\n\r\nmaybe i'm finally turning into a typophile... \r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: 'I"ve seen Weiss used a few times as a text font in novels, and it works well
    if properly set (modest point size, generous leading). Does have a more distinctive
    character than say a page set in Adobe Garamond, so it''s not for every novel.
    Only title I can think of off the top of my head is The White Puma, by R.D. Lawrence.
    Weiss is also slighter wider than the average text font. Overall, then, not one
    to use if economy of space is an issue. The italic is wonderful in small doses.
    Drawbacks: no small caps, and roman figures, though smaller than cap height, are
    lining, not oldstyle.'
