  body: 'It definitely feels quirky, and the jumpy rhythm makes for an interesting
    face. Its irregularities make it appear handwritten - it&#39;s not immediately
    apparent this is a font, which is a good quality.  <BR> <BR>After scanning it
    a few times, three letters  jump out at me: &#34;a&#34; ,&#34;R&#34;. and &#34;g&#34;.
    The &#34;a&#34; feels too tall, the &#34;R&#34; feels out of case, and the bowl
    of the &#34;g&#34; is much too small. See &#34;wavelength&#34; <BR> <BR> '

  body: For the most part, your character weights seem relatively consistant. However,
    some of them aren&#39;t. The &#39;t&#39; and &#39;i&#39; for instance. They seem
    too light. The bowl &#40;loop&#41; of the &#39;g&#39; seems too small and too
    light. If the consistancy were more irregular, almost as if you were righting
    on a cheap 24# text weight with a ballpoint that is running out of ink. Or fix
    those characters that seem out of place. I agree with Jared&#39;s comments as
    well. Oh, the &#39;b&#39; seems too light also, and the cross-stroke on the &#39;t&#39;.
