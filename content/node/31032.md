  body: Now that Adobe is opening up PDF to be an ISO standard, it's going to be hard
    to kill it off. I would not, however, be surprised to see governments and businesses
    standardize on XPS due to the percieved simplicity of using only Microsoft standards
    and because the built in DRM system will make it harder for employees to leak
    documents. I know that people in the military/intelligence fields will love being
    able to lock down printing and taking screenshots to a single workstation within
    an entire enterprise without using resorting to trusted Solaris.

    US military superiority as instances where competition is considered harmful?
    \r\n\r\nWhat I like about XPS/XML/WPF is the end-to-end story based on a unified
    rendering model, with human-readable markup that actually specifies fonts and
    typographic features in an editable form. If all XPS does is force competitors
    to move further beyond the static document model and drives innovation is this
    space then that's a good thing, no? \r\n"

      Often it has to do with market penetration and what becomes mainstream. Look
      at early examples, the querty versus the dvorak keyboard. I hope XPS inspires
      Adobe to further improve the PDF.

    but there are no current plans to make XPS cross-format; a PDF can be opened on
    Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD, Amiga, etc... an XPS only on Vista or a hugely upgraded
    (.NET 3.0) XP/Server 2003 machine.\r\n\r\nI use MS products but I am against this
    format. If it forces PDF to get better, great. But I see it mainly as a way for
    MS to lock people into using their stuff."

    usually NOT good for the consumer in the long run, but oh well. That is the way

    MS has a long track record of using 'standard' formats to them make a completely
    proprietary MS format.\r\n"

  body: i played with XPF for a bit, but didn't like much of the results i was getting.
    when trying to export an OTF font, i kept getting errors about a VORG table missing,
    so i was only able to export documents using TTF fonts. But this was all a while
    ago, so maybe this is just the jumble that time has created inside my head.

    convenience, and that is fine. PDF isn't going anywhere, especially if XPS either
    sees no or limited support on other platforms. The only thing that will replace
    PDF will be a format anyone can use and is significantly better. I am just not
    seeing why many people should feel compelled to choose XPS over PDF.\r\n"

    just added a note from Mike regarding the production process. I think what's interesting

  body: "I'm surprised ODF (Open Document Format), a format that was announced with
    much ado, isn't really mentioned. XPS, I feel, won't be a big thing because PDF
    workflows in print shops and graphic companies have been virtually standardised.
    It's a file format that is ubiquitous, and while often (in Government and other
    instances) there is not even the question of cross-compatibility, the presence
    of the Mac in the graphic sector does command it. ODF is an open standard for
    a human- and machine-readable document, which I would truly love. \r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nI
    too think competition is good but the best product does not always succeed. Often
    it has to do with market penetration and what becomes mainstream. Look at early
    examples, the querty versus the dvorak keyboard. I hope XPS inspires Adobe to
    further improve the PDF.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, Adobe's hearing the hounds on it's
    heels. The MARS project will be bringing (a bit) more XML into PDF, but I really
    hope to see ODF as even an option to export to. Hopefully, we will get a format
    out of this that is open, crossplaftorm, editable by hand and secure, since I
    don't trust propietary DRM either (see cases of Fairplay and current encryption
    schemes in PDF). But more than often, we will see a pretty good starting position
    and an iron marketing strategy give Microsoft the upper hand."

    currently has some very narrow rights to the ClearType Collection fonts, and are
