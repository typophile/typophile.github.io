  different animal and probably doesn't belong in Critiques anymore [[My submission
  for Goal Logo contest]]\r\n\r\nhere's a new twist on the contest scheme although
  not posted as a contest\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/Job_List/Logo-designer-needed/1212]]\r\n\r\nIn
  this economy it seems a little cruel to post \"Logo-Designer-needed\" on a job search
  web site for a non-paying gig. "

    I\u2019ve learned to accept that logos will never be bread and butter work for
    me."

    a business, you must have some capital. I always say to people who want free design
    work; if you can pay your nifty iphone bills, surely you can pay for some design
    work. Did you pay for the rights to publish those books?"

    resorts to more and more <a href="http://typophile.com/node/54325">desperate tactics</a>.
    Unfortunately, in the near to medium term I can see many design disciplines threatened
    by this trend, not just logo design. But hey, it might be just me :|

    logo/website/graphic design services that are often from templates, copies of
    something else and/or outsourced work which hails the idea of unlimited revisions.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not quite sure how business owners can take a site offering a $50 logo seriously."

    around you see that there is still enough quality work being made.\r\n\r\nBut
    people should understand that you can't get a piece of that quality work for little
    or no money. That's just not how it works.\r\n\r\nOf course, I have done (and
    still do) work for low(er) fees, but I only do that if I think I'm going to like
    the project enough. And of course I don't do it for nothing."

    Company article</a> you linked to in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/58639\">Goal
    Logo thread</a>... (Your link to that thread is leading to a TypoWiki page you've
    inadvertently created.) Good article!\r\n\r\nCraigslist is also full of ads requesting
    logos for little or no money... I think that instead of concentrating on those
    kinds of ads, it's better to promote yourself and go after the kinds of clients
    that would be willing to pay for a well-made logo... or poster, or brochure, for
    that matter."

    don't know anyone willing to work for free...even for student. Whether you like
    it or not they are real clients who are too cheap to pay for professional works.
    At the end of day they get what they pay for...which is amateurish works. If that
    is how much they value their companies so be it. Bottom line, the student who
    did work for them gained real life experience."
