  name is Moustache and the market is 18-25 year old males. The source of their name
  is L.H.O.O.Q by Duchamp. They like the irreverence and wit of the piece and hope
  to do the same thing in fashion.\r\n\r\nI know Duchamp is heavily associated with
  DaDa but because Punk referenced DaDa so heavily, when I reference DaDa I find myself
  referencing Punk inadvertently, which really isn't their bag. It's all a mighty
  tapestry... :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, does anyone have any other ideas I might pursue? I
  don't mind doing some footwork on this. I suppose what I am looking for is typographic
  history. What else was going on in France at that time that he might be associated
  with?\r\n\r\nThanks for you help.\r\n\r\nTim"

    S\xE9lavy), optical effect devices, inventing readymades, graphic design (I'll
    get back to that), declaring painting dead, staying with friends and patrons (for
    years at a stretch), living of the same work for decades by producing official
    replicas, watching dust grow & being impossibly smart throughout all. You probably
    noticed: MD is my all time hero and fave.\r\n\r\nGraphic design: MD did some remarkable
    work in this field, not dilettantish at all \u2014 he really dove into it. A very
    nice one is a cover he did for a box with fascimile in 1934: the titling was done
    with punched out holes. Couldn't find a pic of that online.\r\nOther stuff, to
    give you an impression:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/duchamp_1_6139.jpg]\r\n\r\nThat's
    a cover for a chess book he did. And this is poster for a gallery:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/duch3gr_3996.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
    his high days Akzidenz Grotesk-like type was en vogue, as well as strangely ornate
    Nouveau-ish display type. \r\n\r\nThere used to be a font based on his handwriting
    available (from P22), but no more:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/projects/dufont.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A pity about the P22 font. That would have been a good option to explore.\r\n\r\nBert,
    by \"strangely ornate Nouveau-ish display type\" do you mean like Arnold Boecklin
    or Auriol? I am afraid those would be too feminine. And Akzidenz would be a bit
    dull for a logo, don't you think? Or perhaps I am just not a good enough designer
    to make it work. One doesn't want to blame unimaginative design on the typeface.
    That said, I can't think of a way to make Akzidenz a good wordmark for youth menswear.
    \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions? And thank you for the link, Chris. I should have
    included that myself.\r\n\r\nTim"

    me to part with money -- but a font that strikes is Stone Sans.\r\n\r\nIf the
    more intellectual side of the coin is of any use, take a look at  <cite>Manifesto:
    A Century of Isms</cite> edited by Mary Ann Caws, published by the University
    of Nebraska Press, and designed by Richard Eckersley. Text in Stone Print, chapter
    headings & Stone Sans, & I wish I could remember the display. In any case, the
    book covers that period rather well, but from a more literary point of view."
