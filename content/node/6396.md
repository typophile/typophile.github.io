body: oh, about the archives. are some of the ID archives missing? I had someone ID
  a font for me as Bradley about November-ish and i can&#39;t seem to find it when
  i do a search &#40;someone had posted an image i wanted to reference&#41;. I looked
  for the corresponding date in the archive section and it seems a whole chunk of
  months from Dec 2003 to Jun 2004 are missing. <BR> <BR>or have i just lost my marbles?
  that&#39;s a perfectly plausible situation. at any rate if anyone could point me
  to where to find the missing archives or reassure me that i haven&#39;t lost it
  completely i would appreciate it. thnx!

    you can get there using Google&#39;s advanced search, and requesting it to return
    results from typophile&#39;s domain only.
