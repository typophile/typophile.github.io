  that's been on my mind for some time.\r\n\r\nDoes the increase and access to high-resolution
  screens mean that hinted web-fonts will become irrelevant in the future? I might
  be missing something, but since the standard print resolution is 300 dpi and products
  available today like the Retina screen for Mac Computers (boasting around 220 dpi),
  will there be any reason to hint type in, say 5 years time?\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand,
  hinting seems to be the most laborious & code-heavy part of type design, and many
  type designers outsource the work to 3rd-parties, so I imagine this would be great
  for small foundries with tight budgets?\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "This has been discussed before (but putting it in General Discussion might
    help). I think hinting won't become irrelevant that soon, because modest-resolution
    screens will remain around for a while.\r\n\r\nAlso consider that some scripts
    (like Chinese - not exactly irrelevant in the future :-) rely on a lot of internal
    detail.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Hinting is design-specific, not only resolution-specific. So while it may
    make sense to say that for many type designs, particularly those for a particular
    set of writing systems, hinting may fairly soon become irrelevant for many significant
    uses, it isn''t possible to make that claim about all designs, all writing systems
    and all uses. '
