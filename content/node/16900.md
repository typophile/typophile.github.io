  - obviously it's been stretched and warped a lot, but I'm having trouble finding
  any other font like this - that style terminal on the a seems particularly difficult
  to find.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    not like a <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/letterheadfontsco.jpg\"
    target=\"new\">period treatment</a> of a logo is beyond being done well.\r\n"
