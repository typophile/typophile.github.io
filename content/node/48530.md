body: "I'm having a problem with fonts being transferred across internal network.
  \ Mktg dept creates file (usually InDesign), packages fonts/links, and drags & drops
  to my hard drive.  Fonts appear on my end as FFIL & LWFN icons- they seem to match
  up so having just the printer font or just the screen font doesn't seem to be the
  issue.  I drag & drop packaged font folder into Suitcase Fusion, but not everything
  goes.  Keep getting hung up on Helvetica Neue and Times New Roman PS MT. \r\n\r\nI've
  been researching and found that others have had this problem with the LWFN fonts-
  I read the workaround was to install the fonts directly into system fonts folder,
  but that didn't work.  \r\n\r\nUp to this point, I've been substituting ttf for
  PS, but am having issues now with type moving and I'd really like to just figure
  this out.\r\n\r\nAny idea what is going on?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: "Helvetica Neue and Times are part of the Apple \"core\" fonts, installed
    with the system... unfortuantely, they usually don't match older/more complete
    versions. For example, Apple installs a single weight of Helvetica Neue, used
    (i think) by iCal.\r\n\r\nTry searching your hard disk for those two fonts, and
    make sure you don't already have them installed in your System's Font folder(s).
    Un-install ALL of them, then install the PostScript versions thru Suitcase --
    you'll probably have to do a restart AFTER removing the fonts, but BEFORE dragging
    into Fusion. If the Fusion import still doesn't work, you can manually install
    the new fonts into your System/Library/Fonts folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
