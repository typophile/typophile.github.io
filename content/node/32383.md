    gets you your second job is what & how well you did during your first job. Having
    said that, I will admit that I''ve a few friends who graduated from RISD & if
    they are any indication, it is a good school. '

  body: I think u have to get the basics in art, just like in any other major, and
    if u can do that in school, it's ok, but in my case i learn much more doing things
    rather then going to school, although i finished an art school. But it's always
    the teachers, so if u know that the teachers are good, yes go study.

  body: "I originally got into design through an interest in playing with Photoshop
    and building webpages for fun. After a year or so at a couple entry level jobs
    I decided that if I wanted to continue this as a serious career (which I did)
    I should consider getting some formal schooling (which I did).\r\n\r\nI found
    2 things as a second-degree student, First, already having a degree (and being
    6 or 7 years older than \"true\" freshmen) I had a much greater sense of what
    I wanted to get out of my time at school and felt like I approached my classes
    with much more intensity than I had with my original (English) degree. Second,
    3 years into a 4 year degree program I decided that I had learned enough (and
    spent enough :D ) to start working.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't think degrees are
    useless, but if you already have a degree, work experience, and a strong idea
    of what you want to do (strong enough to leave your current career to start something
    new) I think you have some flexibility in how to approach a design education -
    that is, what you think might work best for you.\r\n\r\nConnal"

  body: Just learning computer programs/applications does not make you a designer
    - art school is the way to go - learning to look and truly see, drawing - design
    fundamentals - color - and learning to be creative -  look at the program of study
    and if it goes beyond just being a "techie" go for it.

  body: "Design 'certificates'...especially web design, are more temp-agency centric
    than design-agency centric.\r\n\r\nThat said, RISD carries a lot of cache, so
    maybe that's not all that bad.\r\n\r\nThe key though is getting the graphic design
    background. The technology part will come either on it's own (your own ambition)
    or later if you decide to focus solely on that.\r\n\r\nOne advantage of the web
    industry, in general, is that they haven't bee as hung up on degrees as the more
    traditional print/ad agency world. \r\n"
