    what it is would be to simulate it. Anybody owns a license for Giza?\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, if you want this effect all you need is a nice'n'chunky slab and
    start stroking the thing. ;^)"

    white stroke. It would take a bit of tweaking to get it to look exactly the way
    it does above, but I'd say this is definitely the typeface.\r\n\r\nSkylar[img:sites/default/files/old-images/giza-stroke_5030.gif]"
