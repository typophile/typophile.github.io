  body: Dude, I am definitely the person to ask. <BR> <BR>I graduated from RISD in
    the United States &#40;BFA Graphic Design 2001&#41;, and am now studying typography
    in Germany. <BR> <BR>First of all, be prepared for a lot of beaurocracy, which
    will often be contradictory. <BR> <BR>If you already have a bachelor&#39;s degree,
    you may be able to transfer halfway into a German Diplom program. German Diploms
    are technically equivalent to Masters&#39; Degrees, even though the British have
    recently challenged this. Almost all German college students graduate with this
    one degree, which normally takes anywhere from 4 to six years to complete. The
    German government is trying to phase in BAs and MAs, but it hasn&#39;t hit the
    serious art schools yet. <BR> <BR>In order to study graphic design as anything
    other than an exchange student for a semester or two, you must speak German. You
    must pass exams. Some states require you to have already passed the exams before
    you can even apply, like Baden-W&uuml;rrtemberg. <BR> <BR>Some states will charge
    you a 500 Euro per semester tuition fee, because you already have a foreign degree,
    like Nordrhein-Westfalen. German higher education is still generaly free, but
    I would be willing to bet that this would change while you would be enrolled.
    Be prepared to have to spend more money than expected to finish your degree if
    you start one. <BR> <BR>There are two types of university in Germany, Universit

  body: 'Hello Dan, <BR>just a question about the HfG OF &#40;only general interest&#41;:
    I heart that there was a so called &#34;Schriftklasse&#34; &#40;I think teached
    by Prof. Hoefer&#41;, and that this Schriftklasse was given up some years ago.
    Do you know sth. about that?'

  body: Karlgeorg Hoefer has been dead for over four years, unfortunately. He taught
    at the HfG Of for decades, from the end of WWII until his retirement in 1979.
    Calligraphy has not been taught at the HfG since the late 1980s, at least. Type
    design hasn&#39;t been really taught there either since the early 1990s &#40;and
    won&#39;t ever be again, so I hear&#41;, evern though a lot of students engage
    in a bit of it

    corner in Darmstadt &#40;I live in Wiesbaden&#41;. Do you study there? <BR> <BR>For
    a few months now, a few students from the HfG and I have been organizing regular
    Typo-Stammtisch evenings in FFM/Sachsenhausen. Our next one is one is on Tuesday
    the 31st, and if you are even the least bit interested in type design, your should
    come. &#40;This invitation goes for anyone else who might be in the Rhein-Main

  body: Thank you very much Dan. This will help me alot. It really looks complicated
    to study in Germany but I speak german and have a german pass. I&#39;m sure that
    just by speaking the language it will help a lot. Do you think that with the german
    pass things might be easier???

  body: Dan, thanks for all the info. I was aware that K. G. Hoefer died some years
    ago. It&#39;s a pity, that type design education has become less important in
    Offenbach since his retirement &#40;there are not so many cultural highlights
    in this city anyway in my opinion, and the Schriftklasse was said to have a high
    reputation&#41;. <BR> <BR>I am not a design professional -- I studied in Darmstadt,
    but nothing related to art. Nevertheless I am interested in the Stammtisch &#40;thanks
    for the invitation&#41;, but unfortunately I am on a move away from Darmstadt
    next week, since I finished my studies. So probably I won&#39;t have the time
    to visit Sachsenhausen. <BR> <BR>Markus

    to get a little bit more working experience and a better portfolio. Also because
    of all the stupid beaurocracy.  Do you think it is to much time??
