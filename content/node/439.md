  body: Yves, that&#39;s what I first thought too. <BR> <BR>BJ, from your clues, I&#39;m
    wondering if this is from the &#34;For Dummies&#34; type. I don&#39;t even recall
    what that lettering looks like. Didn&#39;t Chesh admit once to drawing the full
    alphabet of this? <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>

  body: The clue is Cooper - and the digitization of his handiwork. <BR> <BR>The glyph
    is an uppercase Q. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not a script. And it&#39;s available at a
    major type outlet. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>
