    bigger. Now they have almost the same weight.\r\n\r\nPieter"

    I guess u need to slightly increase the weight of the symbol so that the symbol
    could stand out more.\r\n\r\nTry to arrange the symbol at the front of the logo
    type 'Duban', try to experiment with other arrangements as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nChriswong"
