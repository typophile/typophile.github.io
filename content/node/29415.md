    body: "Thanks Adam , very kind of you to reply . I enjoy your writings and learn
      a lot from it . \r\nDon't you think working on half the grid size of a given
      ppem size will help to achieve more precision specially on curves  ?\r\nBy the
      way I am working on Ethiopian font which has a lot of characters . Hinting takes
      so much time and needs very good skill I am thinking to make bitmapfont .\r\nThanks
      a lot !\r\n\r\n"
