  body: New Wacom Intuos 3 <BR>Every workstation in the bureau has some Wacom, from
    the old grey serial 1, a translucent black, the Wacom 2 to the new 3 series...
    a history of Wacom :-D.  <BR>Everyone is absolutely irritated at first and then
    awnts to take the thing home for working with Photoshop at the weekend :-D. Probably
    each intern leaving this small bureau is sooner or later buying a Wacom-- they
    should $%&amp;/&#40;&#41;ing sponsor me.

  body: I like the old Wacom tablets with the easy flip-up flip-down transparent cover,
    which made it easy to slip a piece of artwork under for tracing. The more recent
    tablets have a hard plastic cover that has to be clipped on and off, which is
    an inconvenience.
