body: "I recently purchased an Adobe font \u2013 Myriad Hebrew Bold \u2013 to use
  on a client's job. I can't read or write Hebrew but I usually can just copy and
  paste letters into InDesign based on a sample sent by the client. On my Mac I can
  use Quick Look to see a preview of the font and Suitcase, my font management system,
  also has a preview. Myriad Hebrew Bold (which is definitely Hebrew on the Adobe
  site) appears as an English font on my system, in both previews and when used in
  any program. After hours being transferred around on Adobe Customer Service, the
  final verdict was that I needed a special non-English keyboard or something to use
  the font! I have dozens of other foreign language fonts that work perfectly. Does
  anyone have any idea what's going on? Could this really be a font that can only
  be used in a Hebrew language system environment? There's certainly no reference
  to that on the Adobe site. Any help would be appreciated."

  body: The font uses Unicode Hebrew encoding, so you will need an environment that
    supports right-to-left Unicode layout, and some means to input Hebrew Unicode
    characters (e.g. an appropriate keyboard driver (i.e. software; not physical keyboard)).
    The font contains both Hebrew and Latin characters, which explains why it might
    preview as Latin.

  body: Thanks John.  That's a lot clearer than the answer from the Adobe customer
    service rep. Any suggestions on a keyboard driver or other software I might acquire?
    Not sure if it's worth the effort on my part, I do have other fonts that work
    on my system, but this one has the look I want for this job.

    turned down a book with Hebrew, but because none of us have the language, and
    this text used cantillation marks. I can painfully proof for the right characters,
    but when you add the marks & software control of their placement... better to
    have familiarity with the language. Or so we feel. However, right to left setting,
    even in the middle of a Latin sentence, was not a problem."

    body: No file was given. A client sent me a pdf of two words in Hebrew that they
      want as part of an ad. I usually open one of my Hebrew fonts and then visually
      copy the letters I see one by one in the into my document. It's an illiterates
      way of writing, but it works for a word or two. The other Hebrew fonts I use
      just show up in Hebrew in my document and don't require UniCode or any other
      additional settings. I don't really need to type right to left, I just hunt
      and peak a few letters and I'm done.

  body: I know that the World Ready Composer can be used in regular InDesign, which
    will automatically do right-to-left <em>character</em> layout for Hebrew, but
    I didn't think you could do right-to-left paragraph, story and document layout
    in the regular version. Also, I think you need the ME version for Hebrew hyphenation.

    don't know. We did force different linebreaks in the Hebrew sentences by adding
    junk Latin characters at the head of a test paragraph, and it rebroke the lines
    with Hebrew correctly, but that's not the same thing.\r\n\r\nFor the original
    poster -- If it is two works, I'd just set the Hebrew any way you can. I've set
    20 pages of it that way from manuscript -- with cantellation marks put in by hand
    to mirror the manuscript. I told the client what it would cost ahead of time,
    and held the charges to that (a very large amount).\r\n\r\nThis was before OpenType,
    by the way. OpenType offers great time savings, but you then have to trust the
    software, as there often isn't a *manuscript* -- just a computer file in MS Word.
    And you know what that can be worth...\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nBTW, I believe John
