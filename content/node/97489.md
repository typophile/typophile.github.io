  body: Can any one help me how to find out if python is installed or not? After installing
    Python and the opening the macro toolbar, i tried doing an example(mentioned in
    the fontlab manual). After selecting the middle effects from the middle dropdown,
    the rightmost dropdown is greyed out and nothing happens. I think python is installed
    but no effects installed? I am getting an output saying the opened glyph is S
    and no of fonts open is 1 when i am running the macro.

    which seems kind of stupid, but I am not scripting genius\u2026"

    that will work with it."

    won't work with it.\r\n2. The Public Preview of FontLab Studio 5.2 for Windows
    works with Python 2.7.x as well (32-bit)."
