  Help.\r\nIn my \u201Creadings\u201D I found an type designed by a Portuguese typography
  offer to the King (at the time). See picture.\r\nMy investigations lead me to similar
  types. But again, I need the \u201Cpros\u201D feedback.\r\nIs this already in use?
  I mean some typeface equal?\r\nI would love to digitize it, but dont want to find
  something equal out there.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tuga_5452.jpg]"

    interested is what brings us here in the first place.\r\n\r\nIDing from 3 glyphs
    only, all being caps (lowercase gives away more of a face), isn\u2019t easy. Don\u2019t
    you have a little more?"

  body: "Thanks Jan...and sorry for my lack of patience...I've been really happy to
    meet these forums...\r\nSo I enclosed now the regular and italic (A-K) letters
    to see if it helps.\r\nLike I said this seems similar to some Old style Typefaces
    but want to narrow to a name if possible.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo_6512.jpg]"

    try contacting him.
