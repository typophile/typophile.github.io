My first thought when I saw this was that it was a modified Trajan Pro, but it definitely isn't as the serifs are different, the uppercase R is significantly different and there are a number of other subtle differences. Can anyone help me figure out what it is?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your reply. I took a look at Life and I noticed that while it is similar, I don't think it's quite right. Most notably, Life has a serif on the top left of the uppercase N whereas this sample image does not. That was one of the things that made me think Trajan right away. There are also some other subtle differences if you look very closely.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wasn’t trying to suggest that your sample was unedited. One of the reasons it is difficult to ID is that it has been heavily manipulated—as most logotypes are, if they aren’t drawn from scratch.

Life seemed the best overall match for proportion and serifs (before some were edited out).</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LifeAsBRANDON_edited_4049.jpg]
The first row is the logo.
Second row is Life at width of 133%
Third row is Life at width of 125%
Fourth row is Life at width of 100%,
All standardized for approximate same height.
Seems that although there is no guarantee that Life is the source, it could indeed be edited to make the logo.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the reply, Don. I completely agree that Life could be edited to make the logo. To me, though, some of the extremely minor differences seem like something no one would do. There's these really minute variations that I have trouble believing someone would spend their time mucking about with in the process of making this logo. And I'm the kind of guy that mucks about with minute details a lot! For example, look at the top left corner of the top counter in the uppercase B. On the sample it curves straight into the corner, while in Life it starts an ever so slight down curve before hitting the corner. Sure it could have been edited, but who's gonna spend the time to do that for a simple logo? I won't bother mentioning them all but there are several others. Those kinds of differences are just placing a seed of doubt in my mind. While I agree that Life is very close and may indeed be the original font, due to those differences I'm thinking it's a little more likely that the original font is something else, which we may never discover.</div>
