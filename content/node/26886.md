body: First off I love typophile and the help I have recieved in the past. I have
  looked everywhere I could think of for this techno styled font and I was almost
  certain I saw it on t26.com but now can not find it. It is a very slashy font with
  lots of slants. Does it look like familiar? Here&#39;s some samples. Any help is
  appreciated. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.usoutdoor.com/images/impact_logo.gif"
