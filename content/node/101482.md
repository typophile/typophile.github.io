  body: it's not an exact match, but [[http://www.fonts.com/font/the-font-company/pasadena/heavy|Pasadena]]
    may be something you can start from.

  body: "Aside from the uppercase 'G' - I think Pasadena is pretty spot on as long
    as it would be a more heavy/expanded wieght. Since 'Pasadena' was originally digitized
    by \"The Font Company\"   http://typophile.com/node/69469  I'm guessing the original
    was a film type and likely not currently owned or administered by anyone?\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if the 'G' was an alternate of the original font, but either not digitized
    or ? Any advise on what the original non-digital font would be?"

  body: "A film type might not have a legal owner in the US, but it can have one in
    much of the rest of the world, plus it usually does have a \"moral\" owner anywhere,
    arguably forever. That thread Jodie linked to looks like a must-read in terms
    of figuring out who one might ask for permission.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Close, but the 'R' is not right on Alpha Midnight or your interpretation.
      Getting closer to an origin though, particularly if the Alpha Midnight Solotype
      origin is from a Filmotype (or similar) source.\r\n\r\nBTW Hrant, based on the
      comments that \"The Type Company\" simply closed up shop and effectively abandoned
      their work, I would not consider paying any of the aforementioned font vendors
      for a license. I do find it hard to believe that any individual or entity would
      fully abandon a wealth of digital IP. I'll keep looking for the source."

    body: I am not disagreeing with you. I am simply stating that fonts.com and other
      sellers of (in this example) Pasadena are not paying royalties to anyone but
      themselves. I see no reason to pay fonts.com - hence my search for the underlying
      creator of the work.
