body: "It's weird. It doesn't happen all the time but enough to be really frustrating.
  When I paste a string of latin text into the metrics window, about 30% of the time
  that text will paste in as a string of chinese text instead. \r\n\r\nI am using
  FL 5.1.2 on a mac running OS 10.6.8. This never happened in the older FL version.
  \r\n\r\nDoes this happen to anybody else? Can I make it stop??\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chinese_6525.png]"

  body: where did you copy the text from when this happens? was it utf-8?

  body: My guess is that you are pasting 8-bit encoded text into a 16-bit environment.
    Hence each sequence of two single byte character codes are being interpreted as
    one double byte code, which happens to result in Chinese characters.

  body: This kind of thing is typical of utf-8 text being read as if it were utf-16.  I
    don't know why it would happen, but see if there is any difference between copying
    from TextEdit and Word, for example.

  body: "In this case, I was copying a glyph (solidus) from the metrics window itself
    to paste between a couple figures. But it happens occasionally when I copy a name
    from the glyph properties pallet too. \r\n\r\nI will try a few experiments with
    word and textedit. \r\n\r\nIt only happens sporadically. Some days worse than
    others."

  body: This was a know bug. I experienced it continually pasting text into the font
    header. Upgrade to FL 5.1.3 build 4692 and the problem goes away.
