body: "Does anyone know what the primary font is (heading and body) in the attached
  ad, and if there is a modern digital version of it? My intuition tells me that if
  there were, I would see it used, because it really is beautiful. It seems to have
  been very common back in its day, but I'd never seen it until I recently started
  looking at old print ads and such.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make sure I've researched
  it thoroughly before putting in the time to recreate it myself. Any help is much
  appreciated. I'm a new member on this forum, so hello to all.\r\n"
