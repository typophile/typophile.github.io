body: "The SignWriting script is universal for the sign languages of the world.  Any
  sign language can be written by hand or with a computer  using the SignWriting script.\r\n\r\nFor
  computers, individual symbols were designed that represent hands, actions, locations,
  timing, dynamics, punctuation, and more.\r\nhttp://signbank.org/iswa\r\n\r\nThe
  individual symbols are used in 2-dimensions to create meaningful signs that equate
  to a word.\r\n\r\nThe SignWriting standard currently uses SVG and a lite ASCII markup
  to support the script.  The ASL Wikipedia is a great example.  It has over 50 articles.
  \ It uses the Vertical Writing Mode which is available everywhere but in Firefox.
  \r\nhttp://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wp/ase\r\n\r\n3 years ago, Typophile members
  helped me automate the construction of a truetype font using FontForge.  We were
  able to load 37,811 glyphs indexed against 674 PUA Unicode characters.\r\nhttp://signpuddle.net/iswa/#smartfont
  \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/78542\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we were able to leverage
  Graphite to support the 2-dimensional nature of SignWriting with an additional 505
  PUA Unicode characters.\r\n\r\nIf you install the 6 MB font file, you can see the
  experimental smart font in action on the SignWriting Font test page.  It requires
  Graphite which is enabled in Firefox by default.\r\nhttp://signpuddle.net/iswa/swfont_test.html\r\n\r\nFor
  the official Unicode specification, the SignWriting symbols were split from the
  2-d layout characters. The first proposal has passed through the various committees
  and will be released in Unicode 8 next year.  \r\n\r\nThe second proposal to handle
  the 2-d layout has not been started.  A working character prototype is available
  with Private Use Area Unicode characters and the TypeType Font listed above.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  there is no font that supports the Unicode 8 characters for SignWriting symbols.
  \ I would like to help to create such a font.  Recently, I found the specifications
  for SVG Glyphs in OpenType Fonts.  I wish this would have existed 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe
  ISWA 2010 SVG Refinement is a 2-color font where every symbol is a described as
  a unique glyph with an SVG string. Each glyph is identified by 1 to 3 Unicode characters
  on plane 1. There are 37,811 glyphs in the font.\r\nhttp://signpuddle.net/iswa/#unicode8\r\n\r\nI
  have a data file which contains the raw material needed to create a working OpenType
  Font based on SVG Glyphs. Inside is a text file with 37,811 lines. Each line starts
  with the Unicode 8 name, followed by a tab, followed by the SVG.\r\n\r\nISWA 2010
  SVG Glyphs with Unicode 8 names 1.1 MB zipped, 24 MB unzipped \r\nhttp://signpuddle.net/iswa/iswa_unicode.zip\r\n\r\nThe
  first 2 lines look like this\r\n<code>\r\nu1D800  &lt;g&gt;&lt;path...\r\nu1D800_u1DAA1
  \  &lt;g transform=...\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI am hoping to automate the construction
  of an OpenType Font for SVG Glyphs.  If any additional information or data is required,
  I can provide or reformat as needed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas, I would appreciate
  the help.  In theory, the project should be quick if I knew the right tools or knew
  the right freelancer.  \r\n\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n-Steve"

  body: "I thought I would post a follow-up.\r\n\r\nI've had great success creating
    TrueType fonts for the SignWriting symbols. The fonts are fully functional but
    not production ready. I need to clean up some of the images and adjust the typography
    settings. I've published the fonts I've created on Github.\r\n\r\nThe SignWriting
    2010 Fonts project\r\n* https://github.com/Slevinski/signwriting_2010_fonts\r\nProduction
    and development TrueType fonts with source SVG files for written sign language
    in the SignWriting script based on the ISWA 2010.\r\n\r\nI've also released the
    tools project that created the above TrueType fonts. I spent extra time crafting
    the build script so that it is customizable and informative. Each of the fonts
    above has an associated log file that details the font's creation.\r\n\r\nThe
    SignWriting 2010 Tools project\r\n* https://github.com/Slevinski/signwriting_2010_tools\r\nTools
    for creating TrueType fonts for written sign language in the SignWriting script
    based on the ISWA 2010.\r\n\r\nThe image quality of the TrueType font is not as
    nice as the SVG, but the TrueType font can be installed on a computer or mobile
    device and save a tremendous amount of bandwidth. Pages that use the TrueType
    font will be 30 times smaller than pages that use the server side generated SVGs.\r\n\r\nInitially,
    2 fonts will need to be installed: \"SignWriting 2010\" and \"SignWriting 2010
    Filling\". Each of these fonts is a single color, so together they can imitate
    the 2-color required for SignWriting. The main color font is 6 MB and the secondary
    color font is 3 MB.\r\n\r\nDevelopment continues...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\u223CSteve\r\nhttp://slevinski.github.io/ "
