<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi guys, <br> <br>This is a new font I'm working on for some days now. I had sketched it some months ago, but only started recently. <br>I would like to have some good crits, please. Spacing an weight balancing is off right now. I only have the glyphs in Freehand. I would like to get the basic perfect before I go on with the rest. <br> <br>It has to be a font the works very well in small sizes. I will not make a big family out of it, just the regular bold and black. Caps and numbers are not available yet. They will be made upon this basic look-and-feel. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>RV</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Try giving the "e" and "a" bit more bowl and counter. I will try that and make an update later. <br> <br>> (Ole, you're really taking critiquing seriously! Cool.) I like that too. Keep 'm coming, Ole. I think you're right. I had it in my head but was not sure. With you saying that makes me sure that I have to change it. The first reaction is always the most important. <br> <br>> the x-height is way too small; But that will change if I make the ascenders and descenders smaller. Like Ole also suggested, it will then have less negative space. <br> <br>> and the weight is too light. Too light? Are you sure? I printed it many times in different sizes and it seems to be OK. How much darker does it have to be than? Is there something like a golden rule that I can follow? Do you have maybe a reference font that I can check up on? <br> <br>I'm personally not so sure about the 's'. Do you see a problem there? Another thought is that I would like to make the bowls of the 'd, p' g, q' a bit more round so that the little serifs more distinct (if that makes any sence). Or would you leave that like it is? <br> <br>Thanx, </div>

<div class=commentbody>> I printed it many times in different sizes and [the weight] seems to be OK. <br> <br>Did you do this on a laser printer? <br>Because of the way fonts are RIPed, the lower the output resolution, the fatter fonts get. For example a 6 point font on a 600 dpi laser printer will seem much darker than on an imagesetter. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm, than I have to think this over. Would it be best to change it now or do it later in FontLab?

<div class=commentbody>I've made some small updates: <br>- ascender and descenders shortened, <br>- opened up the a and e bowles <br>- and thinnered the part where the round forms connect to the stems. This should keep it more open in small sizes, although I don't know if I really like it. I kinda liked the way it was before.

What should I change? make the point where it connects to the baseline thinner? <br> <br>> some wobbly curves (illustrated in the your n) <br>I see it, you're right. That definetely needs some fixing. <br> <br>> s: You are right to qu <br>It now follows the curves of the o. Where these abrupt edges are, I tried to replicate it in the s. Perhaps I skip the whole abrupt edges in the s? <br> <br>With this font I tried to keep the inner forms as 'flat' as possible for good rendering on screen. Very large open inner forms, therefor the g has a large bowl. You think it's too large? <br> <br>I think this font will look great in heavy. I simulated it shortly in Freehand, insetting the beziers. Sweet. <br> <br>Thanx for your good crits, <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Do you really think the bowl is too small? It looks good on my screen, though I know that doens't mean anything. I think it gives it a bit more personality. I'll try to change it later and see if you like that more. You've said it before, so I think you will. ;-) <br> <br>Does a tail on the 'a' fit to this concept? That would be the only letter that has a tail. <br>I will enhance the stems in the 'a, b, d', I think that's a good thing. <br> <br>I kinda like this 'y' that I have. I would leave it for now, can always change it later. <br> <br>Will raise the bowl of the 'g' <br> <br>Randy, you are shaking my world. A lot you suggest goes against my original Idea with this font, but I'll follow you and see where it leads me. Please keep in mind that I should not look (too much) like all the other sans serif on-screen readible fonts out there. It needs a certain own personality. <br> <br>Thanx, <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Re: Shaking your world <br> <br>I've found that the intensity of immersing in the project makes me partially blind to the problems in my forms. Only time lets my eyes, see fully again. Barring that, it's a balancing act trying to borrow other people's eyes, but keeping my concept. The same is true of trying to write a paper in school. As you proof your own work, you combine what you've got in your head with what's actually on paper.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Randy and hhp, <br> <br>A small update on Insider Regular. I've been working on it again for the last week.

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm. Well, the remnants of the funky modulation in the original design are hurting you. Like the "O" and dots on the "i"/"j" look totally out of place now, I mean in the overall picture. I think you either need to go back to the original modulation (find out why it's making you "angry", and deal with it) or totally get rid of it. I guess you could alternatively make the funky modulation a very gentle presence throughout, but that will be very hard to pull off, I think. <br> <br>Structurally, the only glyph that really bothers me is the "k" - I'd make it like the UC. The "C" and "G" seem too wide. The diaresis is too strong, and I'd flatten the UC accents. Otherwise once you figure out the modulation issue you'll have a solid design on your hands I think. <br> <br>I think your spacing is loose. Now, if you're still going for small sizes, that's fine, in fact your vertical proportions are much better now for that; but the color will be too light then. Also, because your spacing is loose, you need a bigger blank space - and this might in fact be the problem with the all-caps setting: they're already hard to read, but with their taller height the small wordspace ruins everything. <br> <br>Don't give up! :-) <br> <br>hhp</div>

I have to correct this all by hand. The kerning has to be done also. <br> <br>hhp, you will get your funky modulation. I've looked for my sketches again and found the mistake in my thinking. I will make a complete new version bases on this sceleton. I think I will call this version Insider HHP. ;-) It will be a display face with only two weight (+ Iitalics), a regular and a black.

<div class=commentbody>Very Nice. I like just about all the glyphs except the uc "Q". It somehow just looks a bit too relaxed, for lack of a better word, and it seems different from the rest of the glyphs. Have you considered something more conservative? I took the liberty of doing a mod to a screenshot. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52814.jpg alt=q></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Aaron for the compliment. What say you about the crit from hhp that I discarded the funky modulation that I had in the inner shapes in the beginning. It's not lost, but I skipped it out of this version. <br>Personally I think it's became better without it, because I could let go of some difficulties. I found my error and I will make another display typeface with this funky modulation later on. <br> <br>Is there maybe someone who can give me some good crits and tips on my spacing for the italic. I have difficulties with it. I did it on the fly, but there must be a more constructive way to do this. <br>BTW, is the spacing in the italic narrower than in a regular??? <br> <br>Regards, <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you have your (revised) modulation under control now. <br>- The "k" still bothers me; "s"/"S" too wide. <br>- It would be nice if you could give the numerals more character. <br>- The bars on the Euro are sitting high. <br>- The ampersand is a bit much here. <br>- Spacing: pretty loose. <br>- The italic is quite nice, although in some places it looks too mechanically inclined. <br>- Nice presentation. <br> <br>BTW, the funky version, what about calling it Insiderer? <br> <br>> is the spacing in the italic narrower than in a regular? <br> <br>Do you mean is it, or <i>should</i> it be? <br>Italic forms tend to be narrower, and lighter (and often other things too). The former means the overall space it takes will be less, but the latter actually means the interletter spacing generally needs to be <i>more</i>. <br> <br>BTW: <br>1) What's that cool monogram, that looks like "g3"? <br>2) The usual term is "waterfall", not "cascade". Although I've actually used the latter myself sometimes - it just <i>sounds</i> so much nicer. Hmmm, so forget what I said, just use "cascade"! <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi guys, <br> <br>magnus, that's absolutely correct with the monogram. <br> <br>hhp, what and where do some of the characters look mechanically inclined? Just to get a good feeling for what I should look out for. <br>With my italic I just, like you could see, mechanincally inclined it. I 'italized' it here and there to get the typical italic look and feel. But in fact it is not a real italic. <br>Therefor the width is still the same. My spacing is a bit more tight than the Regular, but I can change that back. <br> <br>I think you're right with the ampersand. I'll change it. What about keeping it in the italic? Would that work? <br> <br>This are the original sketches with the funky modulated typeface. I will start on that this weekend and keep you updated. I'm looking for a good name for it, so if someone has some good ideas... <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53063.jpg alt="Insider original sketch"> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53064.jpg alt="Insider original sketch 2"> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53065.jpg alt="Insider original sketch 3"> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53066.jpg alt="Insider original sketch 4"> <br> <br>Regards, <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Randy, <br> <br>Welcome back. :-) And thanks for the nice compliment. Coming from you I think that means something. <br> <br>Yes, it came right after Nordic. I guess you can see my handwriting. Could you recognize it as my font, not knowing that it came from me? <br> <br>About the funky version, I will finish it based on the sketches. I won't overwork Insider to push the modulation back in. This font will mainly work onscreen and needs no funky modulations; it's a working horse. Insider became more round over the time and the funky one needs a bit more tight curves. You can see that clearly on the sketches. <br> <br>I'm really looking forward for working on the funky font. I've overcome my frustration and feel that I'm up to the challenge now. <br>The glyphs that frustrated me most are: b, e, s (although I now kinda like it with the funky curves in). <br> <br>hhp, what's going on in your head? :-) I don't see it beeing the name for the font, but perhaps the sample book that I will make for it. It's a great theme where I see some interesting images. <br> <br>Later, <br></div>
