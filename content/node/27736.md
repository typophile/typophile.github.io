  body: "Jabberjaw, your question is like asking us to name the best song ever recorded.
    The only answers you'll be able to get from it will be subjective. I might think
    that Adobe's Garamond Premiere Pro is the best serif typeface on Earth. But another
    poster might point to FF Maiola. Or Palatino nova, or Sabon, or a typeface from
    Steffan Hattenbach's MacRhino collection.\r\n\r\nWhile there are certainly a number
    of typefaces that *I* would definitely say are not the best serif types on the
    planet, this wouldn't be helpful either. The best typefaces are tuned to specific
    periods, moods, media, environments, and printing technologies.\r\n\r\nAre you
    looking for a font for corporate identity, a novel, a newspaper, a website, a
    logo, or something else? For each of these uses, you'll still get different answers
    from most Typophile posters here, but at least the answers, like the question,
    will be more specific and help you make the right purchase and create the best
    design."

    It's definitely a revered classic, right up there with Sabon. The italics, for

    it sets just a tad lighter than I'd like on an ink-jet/laser printer.  "

    when it comes to type and I like that. His site is what got me interested in type
    a couple of years ago. I wonder whether he's on Typophile. \r\n\r\nYes, there
    are a few Baskervilles out there, but I think professional opinion has basically
    brought it down to three that are truly worth considering:\r\n\r\nJohn Baskerville
    (and Baskerville Ten) by StormType\r\nBaskerville 1757 by Fountain\r\nNew Baskerville
    by ITC\r\n\r\nEvery time I find something particularly good about JB, I recall
    something equally good about, say, B 1757. I really can't decide between those
    three. Although it seems to me that most people here on Typophile prefer the first
    two I listed. I'm not very knowledgeable about Baskervilles anyway. \r\n\r\nMrs.
    Eaves, however (which is considered a play on Baskerville), is NO Baskerville,
    no matter what anyone tells you. ;-) If you want that low x-height whimsical charm
    of Mrs. Eaves but with spacing that actually makes sense (in terms of extended
    text), then have a look at Emigre's Tribute, which is quite a gem."

    a proportion of acout six to ten a face will look refined and pleasant to read.
    If the x height if much less than that the face may be stylish but will be unsuitable
    for a long text. A larger x-height conduces to dullness.\"\r\n\r\nI think Tracy

    body: 'Many of your objections to Stone Serif would be solved by an Open Type
      Pro version with optical sizes like display and subhead. When Stone Serif was
      new, typositor strips were still being used, and for that market Stone released
      a display weight of the book and book italic. Today, walking past a hardware
      store, I saw a box design that used the typositor display, roman and italic,
      and it was just beautiful. Can''t help you with the large x-height, though:
      unfashionable here, perhaps, but loved to death by clients--and it''s not hard
      to figure why. One curiosity: the Serif book weight is actually tagged "medium,"
      which suggests there''s a Serif Light stuck in Stone''s desk...??'

  body: "Lately, I've been reviewing Josh Darden's new Freight Text, a high-x-height
    serif family not unlike Stone Serif, but crisper above 10pt. Both book and medium
    weights are available for text, very subtly different, and both quite beautiful.
    This family really deserves careful consideration for workhorse use, as does Linotype's
    Sabon Next. Josh's website doesn't sell Freight Text very well; on the \"set your
    own sample\" page, you can try it yourself.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html"
