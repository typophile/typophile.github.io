    your examples could mean anything. The concept is bad. Your posters are not reduced
    to essentials, but simply boring. The exercise seems to be a typical \u2018art-teacher-exercise\u2019,
    which is not your fault."

  body: "I'm not altogether sure what you're actual brief was, but I think you may
    want to start off by looking at the meaning of all three words. Simple, explicit
    and diffusive mean very different things. Perhaps try designing a poster where
    you represent the meaning of each word. What would a 'simple' poster look like,
    or an 'explicit' poster? etc etc\r\n\r\nUnless I've completely misunderstood what
    you're trying to do, in which case disregard the above."
