  copywriting teacher, probably none of us will find a job when we graduate because
  of the economy.  so that's good to know, considering i've already sunk nearly $30,000
  into a college education. what's a student to do? blah."

    web work; build up a portfolio of HTML/CSS and flash sites. Most of the entry-level
    jobs out there are web design/production jobs, and there aren\u2019t any indications
    that this will change. Your professors will tell you to focus on just doing creative
    work and to forget about technology; ignore them. Without the tech most people
    won\u2019t even give you an interview any more."

  body: "thanks for all the advice, it's just difficult to justify paying more money
    for grad school when i already go to a really expensive undergrad.  maybe i'll
    look into a continuing education program with some company... who knows.\r\n\r\nand
    as for web design, yes, absolutely. that is one of my goals before i graduate:
    to have a firm grasp of coding and design."
