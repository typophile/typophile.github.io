body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've spent many hours trying to find an appropriate font style
  for a logo / brand name that will go on an olive oil bottle. The intended brand
  was going to be \"pithari\" and when I found \"piangfaa thin\" I was so happy to
  see how well it worked and how nicely it conveyed culture, hand-craft, ancient times
  AND minimalism. \r\n\r\nThen the brand changed into \"olaa\" and because of the
  repetitive \"a\" it doesn't work as well, it looks a little too industrial. I haven't
  been able to find anything that works as well since then. I think I need something
  that is a bit rougher on the edges, but still clean and minimalist. \r\n\r\nIf you
  know of something that might work in this case, I would appreciate any input. Thank
  you very much!\r\n\r\nAris"

  body: "Thanks ricard0! Hmm, these look like interesting options, but I think they
    need to be a little more hand-written / rough in order to work with \"olaa\".
    I appreciate your suggestion though, these fonts are beautiful. \r\n\r\nAris"

    case calls for a custom font style. I appreciate the feedback, thanks once again!"
