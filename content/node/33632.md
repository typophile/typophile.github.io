  to announce the release of two new fonts\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cookedchicle1_5032.jpg]\r\n<strong><a
  href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000266#specimen\">Chicle
  ST</a></strong>\r\n\r\n\"Taking a break from complex scripts and polished packaging
  fonts, Koziupa and Paul show their more playful side. Chicle is bold. Chicle is
  stretchable. Chicle is kid-proof. Chicle is pet-resistant. This typeface has been
  built to take the abuse of software and designer alike. Perfect for creating the
  elaborate, attention-grabbing artwork required to promote sugary sweets, Saturday
  morning cereal, the loudest toys imaginable, and of course, those smelly treats
  you buy for your cat or dog. Chicle is Spanish for bubble gum. It\u2019s a pure
  sugar fix - accept no substitutes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cookedchicle2_5400.jpg]\r\n<strong><a
  href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000268#specimen\">Cooked</a></strong>\r\n\r\n\"Koziupa
  and Paul prove that they\u2019re just as good in the kitchen as they are on the
  drawing board. Cooked is now on the menu. A juicy alphabet ready to complement any
  visual stew you care to put together. This meaty design, with even meatier OpenType
  programming, was designed to satisfy the most demanding sense of style and taste,
  inducing drool at a mere glance. Cooked is just as suitable on packaging as it is
  on posters or book covers.\r\nThe OpenType version of Cooked is a single face, including
  multiple alternate characters for advanced typographic flexibility. The Mac OS and
  Windows flavours are supplied as a set of three distinct weights. Same great taste,
  different format.\r\n"
