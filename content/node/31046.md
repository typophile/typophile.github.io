body: "I am looking for a sans companion for Bembo Book.\r\n\r\nThe project is a fine
  art auction catalogue (mainly old master paintings). The main body text will be
  set in Bembo Book and I am looking for a sans that will compliment this that I can
  use for side notes, foot notes, tables, image keys etc. It will also be used in
  some text settings. etc. Given the nature of the information in catalogues like
  this I really need an opentype pro font with a decent range of weights and large
  feature set - small caps, lots of fractions (like five eighths), ranging and non-ranging
  numerals with tabular and proportional spacing, superior figures etc.\r\n\r\nI am
  looking for a sans with an element of humanism - I have made a shortlist of the
  following fonts and would like your opinions in order to help me make a final decision.
  I would be particularly interested to hear from anyone who has used one of these
  with bembo book. \r\n\r\nGiacomo\r\nFresco\r\nBliss\r\nScala\r\nKievit\r\n\r\nHere's
  what I think...\r\n\r\nGiacomo - I love it but it was originally off my list as
  it did not have small caps - although I read a thread here from 2003 where James
  from TD said he was planning on making some. I emailed him yesterday to see if anything
  had happened and he emailed me back today to say he had just launched his new site
  an hour ago which now features Giacomo 2 with small caps! How about that! If for
  no other reason than synchronicity Giacomo is probably now top of my list. At $380
  for the full OT pro set I think the price is right too. The only niggle I have is
  that Giacomo while having certain humanist characteristics is not quite a humanist
  face - TD describe it as a face that defies categorisation. I think it will probably
  work well with Bembo Book but without being able to try it out in context next to
  BB I cannot be certain. What do you think? \r\n\r\nFresco Sans - I also love this
  typeface, it fulfills all the criteria I need and it sits comfortably in the humanist
  category so I am reasonably sure it would compliment BB. Before Giacomo got it's
  SCs it was my front runner. My main problem with Fresco is the price - it works
  out to about double the cost of Giacomo. But would it be better with BB than Giacomo
  do you think? Freso also seems a nice name for a font used for a paintings catalogue
  but I can't really lend any weight to that observation...\r\n\r\nBliss Pro - This
  is the last of my shortlist fonts that tick all the boxes, but it works out at about
  3 times the cost of Giacomo. Do you think it would work better with BB than Giacomo
  or Fresco - to an extent that justifies the increase in price?\r\n\r\nScala Sans
  - I have scala sans already and I think it sits very well with BB but it's postscript
  - not OT Pro. I am keeping it in my list as a fallback option if I don't go with
  one of the fonts above. I love scala but I have used it a fair amount over the years
  and I would like to try something fresh. \r\n\r\nKievit - Yeah, I know it's different
  from the fonts above and could not be descibed as humanist but there is something
  about it's lack of character that I like and it seems to work fairly well with BB.
  This may be because it has so little character of it's own that it doesn't really
  conflict with anything you put it next to...\r\n\r\nSo that's where i am so far.
  I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Unless you feel really strongly that
  I have missed out a prime contender, or I am way off the mark, please keep your
  resposes/suggestions related to the five fonts above. I am looking to cut my list
  down and make a decision - I don't really want to make it longer!\r\n\r\nApologies
  for the essay but I figured the more info I gave you, the better responses you could
  give me. If you're still reading this...\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Thank you for your replies and recommendations. Please find my responses
    below.\r\n\r\n> Why would you not consider Kievit humanist?\r\n\r\nPoint taken.
    It was it's quietness I was getting at. As I understand it humanist faces have
    certain calligraphic characteristics and while this is true for Kievit it is far
    more subtle than the other fonts I mentioned. For some reason I have always mentally
    filed Kievit as a good/modern alternative to Helvetica as opposed to the others
    which I have filed as alternatives to Frutiger.\r\n\r\n> The oddball in your list
    is Giacomo; it\u2019s as grotesque and geometric as it is humanist.\r\n\r\nYes.
    I appreciate that. The question is, do you think that this prevents it from being
    an appropriate companion for Bembo Book?\r\n\r\n> Mundo Sans is now available
    as OT Pro.\r\n\r\nMundo Sans looks lovely - I have added it to my list. I looked
    at the pro set on fonts.com but I couldn't see any info about the font (what your
    aims were for the font, when it was designed etc) nor any PDF samples. Can you
    point me in the right direction for these? Also, are you recommending Mundo specifically
    as a companion to Bembo Book? - have you seen it used with BB? - or are you just
    recommending it an alternative humanist sans which you happen to have designed?
    :-) \r\n\r\n> When thinking about a difference of $100-200, think about whether
    you\u2019ll use the fonts again in the future. If the fonts are versatile, you
    license them once, but you can use them again and again, so the extra cost is
    minimal.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I should be reading something between the lines
    here. Are you saying that you would consider some fonts in my list as more flexible
    than others? Do any stick out as being less flexible to you? I would have thought
    that I would be able to find future uses for any of the fonts I mentioned. As
    far as prices go, the difference is considerably more than $100-$200 dollars between
    them. Prices for complete family sets as follows...\r\n\r\nGiacomo - $380\r\nScala
    Sans Pro - $405 \r\n\r\nFresco - $820\r\nMundo - $950\r\n\r\nKievit - $1377\r\nBliss
    -$1750 (gulp)\r\n\r\n> Also consider Cronos (very humanist), and on the more modern
    side: FF Milo, FF Strada (no OT), Vista Sans.\r\nCronos - too humanist (almost
    brushy)\r\nMilo - a little too compact, not quite elegant enough\r\nStrada - No
    OT\r\nVista - interesting - hadn't really considered emigre for this project,
    maybe a little to meta-ish?\r\n\r\n> I have scala sans already and I think it
    sits very well with BB but it\u2019s postscript - not OT Pro.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify,
    I have the postscript version, I see it is now available as OT Pro. \r\n\r\nGiven
    that Bembo Book is a given, I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on
    the above fonts in that specific context. Do you feel some fit with BB better
    than others? Do you feel that some just wouldn't work? like Giacomo for example?\r\n\r\nthanks
    for your help, much appreciated."

  body: Your prices are for complete families but do not take into account the number
    of styles in each family. Most foundries will let you buy individual styles (though
    it's more expensive per font).

  body: "Indeed; the number of styles varies quite a bit from one family to another.
    The choice you are making is probably a common dilemma. 2 of your choices include
    Cyrillic, which might be useful to you. I think the consideration about future
    usefulness simply refers to the ultimate versatility of the design. Can it handle
    extremely large display application as well as text? Are there enough characters
    to satisfy all your clients, whatever international location? Is the Italic wide
    enough? Italic enough? Fluid enough? Are there small caps in the bold faces? In
    the Italics? Is it neutral enough to serve a lot of different purposes? Are there
    obnoxious or distracting characters? Do you hate the ampersand?  ;)\r\n\r\n\"Alternative
    to Helvetica\" - My feeling is, any of the above are good alternatives to Helvetica,
    simply by virtue of their less-ambiguous shapes and open spacing. But Helvetica
    sits in the middle of the grotesque class of sans types, and the ones you're looking
    at are all humanist. It's not only calligraphic traits but proportions, spacing,
    etc. \r\n\r\nGiacomo seems simultaneously too stiff and too industrial for pairing
    with Bembo, but it would be necessary to see them together. Probably this is true
    for all your options. I'm not a fan of Scala because of its stiffness. \r\n\r\nMundo
    is less at fonts.com. Cut about $145 off your price. Steve, send me your e-mail
    address and I'll tell you more about it. Bembo is one of the types it was designed
    to pair with. "
