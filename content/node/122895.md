  body: "It's creative. Not sure I understand why the O was deleted.\r\n\r\nOne concern
    I have is that most folks (at least in the U.S.) transfer business card info to
    their computer and devices. How they would enter the name \u2014 \"f      rmat\",
    \"frmat\", \"format\", or what? And in the graphic below you spell it 2 different
    ways.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format_3825.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso
    your spacing between the \"f\" and \"rmat\" is very inconsistent. I know you're
    trying to vary it depending on the layout, but it creates a very inconsistent
    look.\r\n\r\nNot trying to sound negative, it's a creative solution, just pointing
    out a few things.\r\n"

  body: "Why would you name a gallery \"floormat\"?\r\n\r\nMy point is that I think
    it's a bad idea, from a branding perspective, to omit a letter, particularly a
    vowel, entirely from the logo. A logo should be easy to read, not difficult. While
    it's thought provoking and the conceptual idea is interesting and fun, you're
    really stretching the metaphor by applying it to the logo. \r\n\r\nI agree that
    you should not play with the spacing and it should be fixed. It's bad branding
    practice to \"play\" with the design of your logo in ways that undermine it's
    coherence as a symbol. That said, it *is* an art gallery and breaking those very
    rules might be part of it's mission or culture. I'm just quoting branding bible
    and verse.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like it a lot, but this definitely needs something to connect f to rmat
    and, ideally, to hint that it's O and not, say, E. The <a href=\"http://www.designer-daily.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/more-logo.jpg\">most
    obvious way</a> is already taken, but perhaps something as simple as this -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/format-1_4823.png]\r\n\r\nor
    this -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forrmat-2_5831.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    main problem with the original is that if it appears on a routine document (rather
    than a business card), it will look like a formatting glitch rather than a logo.
    As if someone accidentally selected the o and hit Tab, pushing f and rmat to the
    left- and right-aligned tabstops at the sides of the page."

  body: How about something like this, where the oversized /O/ both connects the /f/
    to the /rmat/ and also represents the white space in the gallery?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Format_4704.png]
