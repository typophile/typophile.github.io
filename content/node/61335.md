  body: "VOLT has a GUI (to throw in another abbrv), AFDKO -- which I assume you mean
    -- doesn't have one. On the other hand, I can't really work with VOLT, GUI or
    not. It assumes quite a lot of background knowledge or something. There are just
    a few reasonable tutorials, and from the barrage of questions with 'VOLT' in the
    subject line in this forum you can derive how clearly written they are ...\r\n\r\nAFDKO,
    on the other hand, has been advertised as the bee's knees if you're into scripting
    and command lines. Well, I'm into that, so with a little help from the accompanying
    documentation I'm pretty much able to make it sit up, beg, and occasionally roll
    over and play dead. MakeOTF has a few peculiarities (such as insisting on a 'registered
    family name'??), but the latest version also comes with an updated TTX, and that
    gives more control over a font than a mere mortal could ask for, including even
    larger ASCII documents to wade through. I've just successfully compiled a font
    with MakeOTF, despite a large wad of warnings, and was able to put remaining finishing
    touches into a TTX dump.\r\n\r\nSince both are free, just install both of them
    and see what works for you.\r\n\r\nFontLab is built upon the ADFKO (not yet the
    very latest version, but I'm sure they will announce clearly and loudly when they
    do) but all the interesting OTF stuff is still done by typing in commands. DTLs
    OT Master (full version) allows you to just type in the required values -- although
    you still need a good background in Opentype to know what goes in which edit field.\r\n\r\nOn
    the subject of GUIs, I'd be sorry not to mention [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/|FontForge]]
    -- it's <em>also</em> free, and from what I have seen, you can do vast amounts
    of 'coding' in a GUI environs. A minor drawback is that it's Linux based (I think
    it <em>should</em> work just fine on a modern Mac OSX).\r\n\r\n[Edit] Almost forgot:
    traditionally, VOLT works best with TrueType fonts, and ADFKO with CFF (Postscript)
    fonts, although both created valid OTFs. However, there are tricks to use CFFs
    in VOLT; and its major feature, being able to add cursive, mark-to-base and mark-to-mark
    features to fonts (needed for accent positioning and scripts such as Arabic) has
    finally been integrated into the last ADFKO."

    hebrew font.\r\nnow, hebrew fonts are the most complex scripts to develop.\r\nCurrenly
    i am using over 45 OFF features and over 200 lookups and 1000ns of context conditions\r\n\r\nAs
    the hebrew font fully supports diacritics and candilation marks.\r\ngrammer distinguish
    of sheva na nach - dagesh kal hazaq ect' ect'\r\n+ it supports grammaticly removing
    the diacritics and inserting letters replacing these diacritics\r\n\r\nso as you
    can C my project is hug.\r\nlately i am having difficulties compilng the font
    for the project is super large and it seems that volt has a code block limitation
    and cannot handle this complexity.\r\nfor now i am still managing to optimize
    my project in verious ways, so for the mean while a can still compile my projects
    but i fear for the near future.\r\n\r\nuntil now Adobe FDK was not an option because
    i use mark to base and mark to mark.\r\nbut i am wondering if this is a VOLT limitation
    that could be solved with FDK or is it an open type limitation.\r\n"

  body: "Did you activate the option to make use of extension type lookups?\r\n\r\nNot
    sure if this is the problem but it looks like you need two split some subtables
    into multiple ones. There is a subtable size limitation of about 65k which is
    a limitation of the OT layout tables.\r\n\r\nI do not see a reason why not to
    use AFDKO. Since the problem -- if this is your problem -- is related to OT layout
    tables rather than VOLT/AFDKO, you'd face it with both of them.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "Since you refer to it, take a PairPosFormat2 subtable as an example:\r\nCoverage
    table and ClassDef1/2 table offsets are, as you say, 16 bit integers so the maximum
    value can be 65536 (meaning bytes, from the beginning of the subtable). This means
    that there's a little less space than that left for the actual kerning data --
    which is Class1Count*Class2Count*ValueRecord(s)[1] -- plus Coverage and ClassDef1
    table lengths to make sure that Coverage, ClassDef1 and ClassDef2 tables are in
    reach. \r\nIt is not too hard to reach this limit.\r\n\r\n[1] For kerning to work,
    there must be a value only for the first glyph of the pair, i.e. one Record. Yet
    do not forget the ValueRecordFormat as another factor. Since with right-to-left
    scripts both positioning and advance width need to be adjusted, this means another
    *2."

    On the other hand, if I type\r\n\r\n<code>spot -t GPOS AdobeHebrew-Regular.otf
    |grep -i offset | cut -d\\= -f3 | sort | uniq -c</code>\r\n\r\nthe largest value
    of offset that is output is 4400. Are there offsets that spot is not outputing?
    \r\n\r\nMichel \r\n\r\nPS The output looks better with\r\n<code>spot -t GPOS AdobeHebrew-Regular.otf
    |grep -i offset | cut -d\\= -f3 | sort | tail -1</code>"

  body: Michel, I don't know whether you're missing anything or not. The Adobe Arabic
    font was made using VOLT -- the only option at the time, and still the only tool
    I use for OTL table work -- and I set the extension lookups option to whatever
    will enable the font to compile in VOLT. I always start with the option turned
    off, but turn it on if the font won't compile. What VOLT does in the background
    is a mystery to me.

    what the extension lookup type (type 9 in GPOS, type 7 in GSUB) is for, allowing
    for larger offset values.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a lookup is not a \"real\"
    lookup but only serves as a relay to a \"real\" lookup (which then contains lookup
    metadata and refers to subtables defining glyph positioning or substitution).
    One might call it a nice hack to overcome at least part of a serious limitation.\r\n\r\nSo
    back to Mr Fried's question, the best thing is to try activating the use extension
    option and see if it helps."
