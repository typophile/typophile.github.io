  body: "Hello David\r\n\r\nI think it looks extremely nice. And you got the '\xF8'
    perfectly right in the true spirit of danish designers such as Thorvald Bindesb\xF8ll,
    Knud V. Engelhardt & Gunnar Biilmann Petersen. (You need an \xC6 though)\r\nA
    suggestion would be for you to draw some nice uncommon ligatures such as 'AV',
    'MV', 'ME', 'ND' and so on. That would really hit the spot when designing titles
    or posters. And it would fit the tradition well.\r\n\r\nConcerning the 'm', have
    you considered bringing in the right leg a little bit. Not much... just a little
    so that optically the whitespace within the 'm' looks even? This is a thing a
    danish typeface designer (<a href=\"http://www.sogren.dk/\">Poul S\xF8gren</a>)once
    told me look out for when drawing the lowercase 'm'. :) \r\nOther than that, I
    think the 'm' looks fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way did you know that <a href=\"http://www.codan.dk\">Codan</a>
    is a danish ensurance company. (You probably did) \r\n\r\nGood luck \r\n\r\nMagnus"

    Carlsberg logotype was beautiful LS.\r\n\r\nAbout the name. I have been told about
    the Codan company, when I was working out first uppercase in Denmark. Perhaps,
    it comes from COpenhagen DANmark. Name of my typeface comes also from the czech
    name for Copenhagen, what is Koda\u0148 (Kodan without diacritics)."

  body: "Hi, David \r\n\r\nI think it looks nice. You can always work on the kerning
    when you have all the characters ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently I have been looking
    through some danish typedesign. (Yes, it actually seems that there is a distinct
    danish way of drawing letterforms.) And I still think you have a lot of Knud V
    Engelhardt's and Gunnar Biilmann Petersen's trademarks in your typeface. The way
    the A is drawn with the big flat top and the way the \xD8 is drawn as well. And
    that goes for most of your letters but the C and G doesn't seem to follow the
    tradition. The terminals should end vertically and not horizontally like now.
    And the G would not have the horizontal crossbar as it does now but only the vertical.
    I hope this weird babling makes any sense to you. Of course my words are just
    guidelines to the way of drawing like the classic danish typedesigners and you
    should not necessary listen to me but just go ahead and do it your own way.\r\n\r\nI
    think the lowercase s is too thin on the middle where it should probably be the
    thickest. But it is tilting nicely now as is the lc a.\r\n\r\nThe first one of
    your two lowercase y's is the best in my opinion. :)\r\n\r\nI think it is looking
    nice. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nHere's a link to a pdf about ligatures (it's in Danish).
    And I think you can find--on the first page--an example of the kind of G I was
    trying to sketch out for you. (In the lower right corner are some logotypes by
    knud v engelhardt and gunnar biilmann pertersen)\r\n\r\nwww.grafisk-litteratur.dk/

    kerning is really awful. I know. :( Actually, it seems, that uppercase looks much
    better than lowercase (not only kerning). I don't know why exactly.\r\nC + G (weird
    babling :) I see. I was thinking very much about it, but it works much better
    now. A, R, V, etc. have sloped endings, but C, S, G would have horizontal endings.
    It is kind of inconsisteny for me. It was done in a \"danish\" way in a first
    version of Codan (I call it <em>Codan 1</em>). You can see it at exhibition posters
    (it was for school exhibition of course) at http://codan.davi.cz. (I'll place
