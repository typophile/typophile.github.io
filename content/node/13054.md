body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\ni need help on one issue concerning a layout made on
  a mac\r\nthat must be edited on a PC. First of all I need to use one single font
  file\r\n(Opentype or Truetype) to build this layout.\r\nThen, the document should
  stay editable on PC.\r\n\r\nDo to so i've made a Opentype and a TrueType test of
  my font.\r\nThe main problem concern the key map.\r\nFor example, the \"\xE9\" character
  on Mac goes away on PC.\r\nThere are also problems with the kerning\u2026\r\n\r\nMy
  question is simple : how could I keep the integrity\r\nof my font file and use it
  both on Mac OSX and on Windows XP.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nGuillaume\r\n\r\nPS : Hope
  my english is understandable\u2026"

    with no Mac-specific cmap - just include a regular Windows Unicode cmap. Run the
    resulting font through Microsoft's font validator.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the
    kerning, you need to turn kerning on in Word on Windows - it's under format, font,
    character spacing.\r\n\r\nFinally I'd suggest that using InDesign on Windows and
    Mac might result in less reflow issues (possibly none) as the product shares it's
    code-base cross platform - Word doesn't.  \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

    body: "A quick answer to my problem.\r\n\r\nThank you sii, your advise solve it.\r\nI
      made a Windows .ttf file of my font without Mac cmap and with a regular Unicode
      one.\r\n\r\nI did'nt use Microsoft's font validator, but it seems to work quite
      well\u2026\r\n\r\nThe first test runs on both Macintosh and Windows Word and
      Openoffice.\r\nWhich is quite encouraging :)\r\n"
