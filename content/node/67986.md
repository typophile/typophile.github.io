  | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nCrucis ornaments is the first in a series of traditionally
  inspired (but newly designed) sets of printers ornaments.  Deva is a modern interpretation
  of classic Roman text and Display faces, with a range of opentype features such
  as ligatures and stylistic alternates. You can read more about them on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com
  | blog]] or try them out for yourselves on Myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nDeva has been launched
  at a 30% introductory discount."

  body: "The sp and ct ligatures in Deva feel very clunky to me, and fight against
    the elegance you seem to be aiming for. There's also a misspelling in the sample
    graphic on your blog. (The third 't' is missing from \"interpretation.\")\r\n\r\nI
    join others on this board in encouraging you to slow down a bit and pay more attention
    to the details of fit 'n' finish (and spelling)."
