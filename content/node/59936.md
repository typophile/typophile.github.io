body: "Hello Everyone!\r\n\r\nI am having some issues with the localized (locl) feature
  for Devanagari. It doesn't seems to work properly in my case. I remember Dan Reynolds
  asking for a similar help long back but that was to do with the spacing I guess.\r\n\r\nOkay,
  I have two sets of punctuation marks for both Latin and Devanagari, and only the
  Latin punctuation marks has unicode assigned to them. I have created a \"locl\"
  feature using VOLT for Devanagari so that it takes the appropriate punctuation marks
  when Hindi is typed. \r\n\r\nNow the issues I am facing is:\r\nWhen I type \"comma\"
  or \"period\"  while in Devanagari mode, it doesn't get replaced with the \"dev_comma\"
  or \"dev_period\". And because of that, the application thinks that I have switched
  to Latin and it converts all Devanagari marks to the Latin marks which is typed
  after comma or period. \r\n\r\nHas anyone encountered this issue before? If so,
  is there a way I can get rid of this? Hello John? Dan? \r\n\r\nHere is an image,
  just to show you what I meant:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TypophileFH_5516.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Is the substitution contextual? (meaning, does it try to find out if what's
    surrounding the punctuation mark are Latin characters or Devanagari characters)

  body: "In my case, I was working with Word. If I remember correctly, there wasn't
    any way to convince Uniscribe that the space character could be anything other
    than the default, Latin space glyph. Oddly enough, I could write some gerry-riged
    OT code to get my Deva space to come up as a substitution some of the time in
    CS3 (I know, I know\u2026). It is theoretically possible that you can't have alternate
    language-specific versions of punctuation yet.\r\n\r\nMy solution in the end (with
    the space) was to make it slightly bigger than I had hoped for the Latin text,
    optically, and slightly tighter than I had wanted it to be with Devanagari text.
    Worst of both worlds, but no one will probably ever complain about it."

  body: Alternatively, have you tried making your Deva punctuation the default, and
    have the locl feature go the other way around? I mean, build the Latin punctuation
    for Latin text as an alternate in the Latin script's locl feature.

  body: "I have tried every possible way to do this - but no, it's not happening.
    :(\r\n\r\nProblem is that the substitution is taking place with a few marks but
    not for all, specially with the \"commas\" and \"periods\". And that is why, even
    if am not using any Latin text while in Hindi mode, Uniscribe thinks that the
    \"commas\" and \"periods\" I have used in Hindi are Latin characters and it changes
    every proceeding punctuation mark to a Latin mark.\r\n\r\nIn CS4, at least a few
    marks are getting replaced, but in the MS Word and other Windows applications
    it's not happening at all. \r\nOh yes, it works fine in the VOLT proofing tool
    though. "

  body: "Satya, the problems you are facing are most likely due to layout engine decisions
    about how and where to divide glyph runs. It would take a while to figure out
    exactly what the issues are in different applications. I'm about the leave for
    TypeCon in Atlanta, so can't offer more detailed advice now.\r\n\r\nI suspect
    Sergey Malkin at MS can explain what is happening in the case of Word. Note also
    that this might depend on what version of Windows you are using: the latest Uniscribe
    rolls punctuation into glyph runs with adjacent text, but relies upon a system
    level wrapper that means this won't work in pre-Vista versions of Windows even
    if you copy the usp10.dll from Vista to an older OS."

  body: "There are two decisions application has to make when shaping multilingual
    text. One is break text into runs based on script for contextual shaping. Another
    one is to choose appropriate font to use. They look very similar, but in fact
    different enough. For example, font matching would preferably use same font for
    all punctuation characters across paragraph or even document and script itemization
    would add comma to preceding word for better kerning. These algorithms may also
    have cross-dependencies and require making compromises, when results of one may
    influence the other. \r\n\r\nDecisions made by both algorithms may be influenced
    by many factors, from base font set on piece of text, document language, language
    for particular piece of text, user settings, etc. I am sure there is no single
    \u2018right\u2019 algorithm for doing that.  It would depend on many factors,
    including target audience for the application. What typographers using InDesign
    expect and are willing to control manually is radically different from general
    audience using Word. \r\n\r\nWord is using language of the text and would probably
    do better job with this, but it has weird algorithms of determining what this
    language is and how to break text into script runs. It may be based on keyboard
    you used when typing or languages enabled in your copy of Office. It may break
    text into runs in arbitrary places, as we recently learned with broken contextual
    shaping of Latin text in Office 2010. It may even reject shaping Arabic if typed
    inside Word, but shape it when you copy-paste it from Notepad.\r\n\r\nWord have
    made lots of compromises, consciously  or unconsciously, over last 20 years based
    on user scenarios and heavily dependent on their layout algorithms. When situation
    changes or new features added , e.g. OpenType shaping is added for simple scripts,
    such logic should be changed accordingly, but this very hard to do because of
    compatibility reasons. In short, we will probably have to live with this code
    in Word for a while.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n"

  body: "Uniscribe itself is lower level library and does not have enough control
    over itemization and font matching decisions. On the level it is used by Word
    or Publisher or Internet Explorer it does not provide font matching functionality,
    so application is on its own to implement whatever algorithms it chooses. Since
    Vista/Office2007 it can help application to some extent by merging neutral items
    to adjacent strong characters. I\u2019ve tried to make this logic to work in most
    general cases, but it still has its own problems. It may do better, however parameters
    available to Uniscribe at this stage lacks context in which text is being set.
    Uniscribe also have higher-level APIs used by Windows UI, such as menus or common
    controls. As you may see experimenting with notepad, text may show inconsistency
    in shaping same punctuation or space glyphs because they may be itemized to different
    scripts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n"
