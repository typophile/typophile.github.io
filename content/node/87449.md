  body: "I think Renko is right. \"Thanks in advance\" is just a typical polite way
    of asking.\r\n...then R. has used his expertise to ID 3 fonts for you, and the
    only thing you do is just asking for more. I'd say to not take people's offer
    for granted.\r\n\r\nAnyway, \r\nyour ampersand is Harrington \xA91992 by Font
    Bureau, Inc.\r\n"
