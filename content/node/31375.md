  body: "Lucian,\r\n\r\nSwedish is not that crazy really, just \"\xE5\", \"\xE4\"
    and \"\xF6\" which are all part of the standard West European set. The CE is separate
    though. Depending on how fast you need it and what the budget is, I would consult
    Linotype for license part, and then get help from for example Filip Blaz\xE9k
    to make the actual signs needed for Polish and Czech."

    by the user to the fonts. If you purchased these fonts from Linotype, please contact
    our sales department at info@linotype.com. They can give you definitive answers.
    Also, they could discuss with you more possibilities about commissioning a custom
    version with the glyphs you need.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan Reynolds\r\nLinotype GmbH\r\nProduct
