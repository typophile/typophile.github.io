  area. Right now their identity is almost non-existent (they have their name set
  in papyrus . . . gag). \r\n\r\nFor any comments on color, the specific colors aren't
  so important, it's more the use of it and how it affects the \"w\" that I'm interested
  in. \r\n\r\nAny comments are welcome though.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twb_3700.jpg]"

    I was also worried about the center of the 'w' being a bit too heavy, which I
    thought the strip broke up nicely. \r\n\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "I personally prefer the ones without the yellow strip. I think the yellow
    strip does break it up a little but i dont think it fits in with the logo.\r\n\r\nI
    really like the simple ones without the yellow. Is there any way to create a small
    'v' nick in between the both parts of the w? I think that might work better by
    creating a more distinguised w! If that makes sense!?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have to agree with smcdow01. I simply don't see the point of the yellow
    stripe and would prefer the ones in the first column.\r\n\r\nI quite like how
    the curve of the \"t\" is repeated in the \"b\". Also, each letter refers to the
    other quite nicely.\r\n\r\nIt's a very simple wordmark, but with some colour added
    it will look quite well I think. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign
