  because you guys are the pros ... \r\n\r\nI've just set up new business and looking
  for ideas for logo font type for my company name (Great font = great logo) \"Tudor&Company\"
  promotes brands through equestrian lifestyle marketing.  Tudor name is known in
  my biz so have been advised to use it.  Guess Tudor goes with \"heritage\" of elite
  equestrian lifestyle. Sounds a bit like \"Town&Country\" or \"Tiffany&Co\" which
  will ring true to the elite horse biz. Suggestions appreciated! \r\n\r\nkimtudor@aol.com"

  body: "Yes James I looked at your portfolio ;)  Great work!  And you are right I
    need to hire someone to take care of logo etc.  Your design fees for logo, stationary,
    yadda yadda. I can pretty much tell that you are out of my tiny little budget
    range but doesn't hurt to ask!  Feel free to email me at kimtudor@aol.com \r\n"

  body: "@kimtudor\r\n\r\nTiny budget range? 25 years in the business... How much
    do you pay your lawyer and accountant? Your designer should be equally compensated.
    How can you not afford a good designer?"

  body: "Kim,\r\n\r\nYou can hire a graphic design student who still in school, check
    around your area to see if there was any design school, they would do anything
    for experience, and for $50 or so, but it won't be that great.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    serious about the business, then you should be serious about the image of your
    company. Paula Scher designed citibank logo for half million in couple minutes.
    Do you think it worth it? I would suggest spend a little bit more on the budget
    range, not to mention there are also fee for trademark, copyright and all that
    too. :)\r\n\r\nBut i think it would help to shop around, see who you can afford."
