body: "I got fed up today (finally) of the spotty OpenType support in Adobe CS applications,
  so i finally looked up their feature support page and sent them a couple of product
  feature requests. I'd like to ask all of you who have time to do so to do the same
  thing. Or if this is not a big concern to you, perhaps you'll use this form to request
  a glyph pallete in Photoshop. These were my two requests this morning. Hopefully
  if Adobe gets enough requests like this, they'll actually do something about these
  shortcomings! The link to Adobe's Product Feature Support Page is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/feature.html\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows of a similar link to petition Microsoft..."

    Microsoft is a better idea. (Not that there is a pressing need for OpenType support
    in Publisher, but it would be nice in Word and PowerPoint."

    will it work the same way across the full suite of applications? that's what i
    would like to see."

    of applications?\r\n\r\nI would suspect so on the old Adobe ones. I'm not so sure
    on the ones picked up from Macromedia, like Flash and Dreamweaver. It might be
    too much to hope that they have completely integrated those programs.\r\n\r\nOf
    course this is just a guess."

  body: "<em>I would suspect so on the old Adobe ones.</em>\r\n\r\nI expected so as
    well, but it turns out different programs handle things differently. if you put
    a 'hlig' feature in your font, InDesign will apply this when you activate discretionary
    ligatures, Photoshop won't. Same story with the 'cswh' feature and applying swash.
    Another thing, InDesign will link alternate glyphs to the reference glyph in the
    glyph palette without an 'aalt' feature, Illustrator won't. It's these types of
    things that i hope are cleared up in the near future."
