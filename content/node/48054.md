  . what does your everyday handwriting look like? I thought it might be interesting
  to see how everyone's interaction with typefaces affects (or doesn't affect) how
  they write.\r\n\r\nTo take part in this, just scan or take a picture of either a
  \"specimen\" or just a piece of scrap paper with your handwriting on it and post
  it here. Thanks!\r\n\r\n(I don't have a scanner working at the moment, but I'll
  post mine as soon as I can . . . sorry to not have one ready to get the ball rolling.)"
