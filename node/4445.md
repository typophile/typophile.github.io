body: Hey all, <BR> <BR>First real critique post for me... Can I get your opinions
  on this? It stands for &#34;Robert Sainte-Marie&#34;. He&#39;s an interior designer
  friend of mine. I thought of including the hyphen but it made the S look somewhat
  like a F. Do you think I should raise the &#34;m&#34; a little? It looks a bit like
  it&#39;s falling to the right to me, I&#39;m not sure. Any other comments? <BR>
  <BR>Thanks! <BR>Em <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34225.gif"

    an &#34;f&#34; even without a hyphen. I think you&#39;ll either need to put a
    little more curve into the &#34;S&#34; spine or extend the top curve just a bit.

  body: I&#39;m thinking maybe it&#39;s the angle that makes it look like an f but
    when I change it it kind of clashes from the rest. Will give your comments a shot

  body: What you have is well executed, but I think the r will be problematic for
    you. This form doesn&#39;t serve as much of a lead in since it relies on another
    letter to even begin! The lowercase script is also the source of trouble with
    the S vs f. These letters have tons of potential. If you have a copy of Fonts
    &amp; Logos take a look at pages 108/109 and 234/235 for monogram ideas. If not
    I will pull a scan in the next few days if you like. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: Hi Randy, <BR> <BR>That&#39;d be very appreciated, I never saw a lot of monograms
    and I don&#39;t own that book. I agree with you on the r, the fact it&#39;s inside
    the sloop also bugs me a little because it looks so &#34;internetey&#34;. By letters
    having potential, did you mean rsm, RSM in general or what I have already? <BR>

  body: Very elegant. But I couldn&#39;t see the &#34;S&#34; &#40;an &#34;F&#34; even
    less though&#41;. If forced, I&#39;d see a &#34;d&#34;. Plus where you&#39;re
    extending the &#34;r&#34; that&#39;s starting to look like an &#34;@&#34;... I
    guess you could leave the &#34;S&#34; subtle, or if you want it more visible give
    it some curve in the spine, somehow. <BR> <BR>Your second direction is cool too
    &#40;and more &#34;S&#34;-visible&#41; - I guess it depends what kind of interior
    design he does. Victorian woodwork or weathered flagstone? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hmmm.. Forgive the S curve, it&#39;s really not there yet! It surely helps
    identifying it and keeping it from falling.  <BR> <BR>As for the version with
    the alternate r, I like the shapes overall but I feel like it&#39;s really about
    to fall and collapse to the right. I also messed some more with the initial direction
    &#40;mostly cleaned it up&#41; I liked the shapes but I don&#39;t want too much
    of the inky texture since I don&#39;t believe that fits with what he does.  <BR>

  body: I like the top one; and I think the middle one can work if you make the head
    of the &#34;S&#34; stronger &#40;and smoother&#41; - but don&#39;t connect the
    &#34;r&#34; to the circle, it seems to make the &#34;m&#34; too isolated. <BR>

  body: I like the stately, dignified look of the last logo, but it definitely reminds
    me of the &#34;Samuel Adams&#34; script. Alternately, I see a J rather than an
    S. What about using an uppercase R and connecting an extended leg to the spine
    on the M?

    think! I need to see more of what he does to pick the right font for the r but
    I&#39;d like to know which you think flow better graphically. Also, are you aware
    of any fonts that have a similar narrow long S? This one is rotated from Avalon.
    I remember seeing another one once but I can&#39;t recall the name of the font.

    the more squared shape&#41; and he really liked it. I believe I&#39;m going to
    keep it this way &#40;it didn&#39;t have to necessarily have to be a monogram
    but I wanted to give it a try&#41;. I&#39;ll post the next steps soon. It will
    probably be my first embossed project... can&#39;t wait!

    similar to tarzana for these caps I&#39;m using but more sober in general? For
    example, the capital E&#39;s are made like inverted 3. Any thoughts on this one?
