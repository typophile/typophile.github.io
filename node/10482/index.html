  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I hope this is fitting for this forum. It's more logo-related than logo-type-related, but seeing the great critiques here compelled me to post. Plus, I'm the only graphic designer in the building, so it helps to get other's input. <BR> <BR>This is a logo for our branch of government here in MN. I've come up with 3 variations that I (and a few others) seem to think are the strongest. I now need your harsh, honest critiques! <BR> <BR>There's one disclaimer, and one I'll probably take some heat for saying&hellip;but I an limited to only free fonts and whatevers on my machine (gasp!). As our state is in the hole a few billion, getting darrel a few licensed fonts isn't really on the priority list. <BR> <BR>So, here they are. <BR> <BR>Logo one (uses Tanek, from CSA) represents the state (duh) and the 10 court districts rendered in a stained-glass-like way. This also hints at the stained glass ceiling installation in the supreme court. PROS: nice double-meaning, simple CONS: not as nice in one-color. <BR> <BR>Logo two (uses Futura, from Apple, and Covington, from apostrophiclab) is the more 'elegant' of the bunch (if not just a bit hokey). It's the state bird perched upon a roman column. (bird = MN, column = courhouse) PROS: most 'regal' of the bunch CONS: is it hokey? (Most have said 'no' but I still wonder&hellip;) <BR> <BR>Logo three (uses Futura, from Apple) is a simple rendering of common iconography&hellip;the state and the scales of justice. PROS: recognizable iconography CONS: cliche? Too trendy? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7047.gif" alt="Logos &#40;GIF&#41;"> <BR> <BR>now, let me have it!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Well, the way I see it is that the Judicial system  <BR>&gt; is about strength against criminality. <BR> <BR>That's just one part of it. Criminal court is just a segment of the court system. There's juveniles, divorces, bankruptcies, child support, etc. So it's more about 'fairness for all' than the courts being 'against' anything in particular. <BR> <BR>That doesn't mean it shouldn't be a 'strong' mark, though. ;o) <BR> <BR>&gt;But if it works with the attitude of  <BR>&gt;Minnesota and the state's other identity <BR>&gt;schemes, go for it. <BR> <BR>Well, in some ways I am fortunate in that I'm starting from scratch. There really aren't any departments with an identity (except for maybe the tourism board).  <BR> <BR>Well, I was hoping to have new stuff to post, but the project has been side tracked this week.
