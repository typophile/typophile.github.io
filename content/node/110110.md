  love to get some insight from people on this site regarding a few things;\r\nI'd
  love to know your opinions on digital typeface adaptation,  do you think we lose/
  maybe even gain anything in tweaking fonts and has this adaptation become easier
  with computer software? \r\n\r\nAlso if you are still in the answering questions

  for any responses!\r\n"
