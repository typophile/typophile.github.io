  body: I suggest you ditch the helmet-crest... as Cristian said, it&#39;s a bit heavy
    on top. I think the alternate characters would be sufficient to create a uniquene
    look, and the very Roman typeface creates all the historical reference you would
    ever need.

    one that is &#34;less solid&#34; works best because it&#39;s less heavy, visually.

  body: The only comment I could add would be to suggest not using a modified &#39;P&#39;.
    I think the P detracts from the main focal point--the &#39;R&#39;. Using a complete
    P may also help with the spacing.

  body: 'I second Darrel&#39;s suggestion to use a normal P. Think about it: the justification
    for the R is that the left side of the counter forms the nose-piece of the helmet.
    There is no such justification for repeating this shape in the P. It looks odd,
    and it draws attention away from the R. <BR> <BR>Personally, I would try this
    with <i>only</i> the R having an abnormal shape &#40;and the T, of course, where
    it is cut off by the crest of the helmet&#41;. I think it is a mistake to remove
    the crossbars of the A&#39;s: sure it looks Greek, but it looks like two uppercase
    <i>lambdas</i>, which confuses me into reading it as SPLRTLN. Actually, in the
    context of the two pseudo-<i>lambdas</i>, the cut-off T begins to look a lot like
    a <i>gamma</i>. And then do I read the P as Latin P or Greek <i>rho</i>? SRLRGLN,
    anyone? <BR> <BR>Making Latin letters look like non-corresponding Greek letters
    is a bit naff: like reversing the letter R to make things look &#39;Russian&#39;.'

    of the top counter area. <BR> <BR>Top of the P looks a little heavy, but that
