  body: It is right?-darn it. Someone on whatthefont told me it was from a Solotype
    catalogue. This is not available for computer's right? It hasn't been digitized?
    Do you or anyone know of something really close to it with the hollow middle and
    drop shadow? I would really appreciate it.

    some research and some Solotype fonts are sold on My Fonts, but not Sacramento.\r\n\r\nYes,
    please, if anyone has any suggestions on how I can locate or at the least, best
    imitate Sacramento, I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: That scan from the Dover book is available digitally, I believe. It's called
    Grand Canyon and you can find it at MyFonts. Though to me, it only bears a passing
    similarity to the early CA example.

    Marcox, thanks, but the drop shadow was important.
