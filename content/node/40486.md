  was an exhibit with a nice font. I took a picture with my iPhone.\r\nI haven't been
  able to ID the font. (And neither has anyone else for that matter.) \r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help me out? I'd love you forever.\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\nImage

    I wanted to link to the version offered at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/kleptocracy/\">MyFonts</a>,
    which is obviously different."

    find a close enough match on myfonts. Seems to be customized. '

  body: "Epilogue...\r\n\r\nI actually went to the source (Ray Larabie) and got an
    answer. There are two versions of this font. Kleptocracy was withdrawn from Larabie
    Fonts in 2001. The old one is still available as a freeware download:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontcenter.com/fonts/kleptocracy.html
