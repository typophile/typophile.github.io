  does not come with a bold version (I might be wrong). If anyone can tell me if it
  has a bold version and from where I might purchase it, I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
  if there is a very similar bold font to this, please let me know. Thanks."

    only the one weight, but with Illustrator, for example, it is easy to add as much
    stroke thickness as you want.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
