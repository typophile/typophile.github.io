  body: "Kerning: horizontal space adjustment between two glyphs. Part of the typeface
    design.\r\nTracking: horizontal space adjustments during typesetting. Not part
    of the typeface design.\r\n\r\nIMHO the problem is rather the narrow space between
    H and I."

  body: What I meant to say (but did not) is that the need for kerning is the result
    of the loose tracking.

    -- If there were no tracking applied to the word, the A would stand out even more.
    Tracking, in so far, has a positive effect rather than a negative one. Unfortunately
    it didn't help much in this case."

  body: Quite right, Karsten, another slack posting of mine. Without the loose tracking,
    there would be very little one could do.
