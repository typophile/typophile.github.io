<div class=commentbody>It's nice, Eduardo. I suppose that you're aware of <br>Peter Verheul's Newberlin, that also uses straight lines <br>only. But I find your Maest more interesting. I agree <br>that there's a crispness in the lc that the UC is <br>lacking somewhat. Some of its characters could be a bit <br>narrower, the bowls of P and R a little smaller. <br> <br>I'm not sure whether the sort of variation in the spacing <br>rhythm that you have here was intentional or not. For <br>instance: how letters seem to coalesce in 'qua', only to <br>disperse again in 'scele' (and especially in 'ss' ;). This <br>"elastic" behaviour may bother some people (not me). <br> <br>One possible problem that I see is that in smaller settings <br>the 'n' could be mistaken for an 'u'. Also, there may be <br>a problem in certain cases with the gap created by <br>the 'c' in some combinations (like ci, ct). But generally <br>it will work, I think. <br> <br>abra</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo <br> <br>i like it a loti agree with rodolfo about the n/u problem, but my main critic is the bottom of your lc "c" and "e", i think it should be more extended, at small sizes it looks to weak to me. <br> <br>for me maest its much better than newberlin, here the beautifull contradiction betwen straight lines and the cursive type is more evident. <br> <br>CG</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo, <br> <br>You should really check out <a href=http://www.stormtype.com/preisig.html>Preissig</a> <br>- much more inspired than Newberlin. <br>When I first saw Maest I was reminded of this. <br> <br>I took a look at the PDF on your site (very nice <br>by the way) and I rather like Maest at smaller <br>sizes. Better in fact. <br> <br>The "f" seems a little spindly to me and I think <br>maybe the dots on the "i" and the "j" are a little <br>to high. <br> <br>While I see what everyone has said about the <br>"n" I don't think it is that big a deal. It does not <br>bother me. <br> <br>But I totally agree about extending characters. <br> <br>Otherwise it is looking good to me. Maest is <br>more expressive than Newberlin. <br> <br>-smc <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice. I enjoy the irregularity and think it too many of the characters conformed to the same rules it wouldn't have the same flavor at all. If anything I would think it would be good to have alternates for the characters so that the user could keep this irregularity more consistant. For instance in your paragraph it seems that some of the words have the first few character aligned on the baseline and then the last few fall off. It might be nicer if there really was a consistant up and down or at least irregualar action/flow of line.</div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks for your comments! <br> <br><i>>Peter Verheul's Newberlin</i> <br> <br>i think i had seen this one long time ago, but i didn't <br>actually know it until you mention it. <br> <br> <br><i>>there's a crispness in the lc that the UC is <br>lacking somewhat.</i> <br> <br>yes, what do others think about it? i think this is my <br>major problem, since an all-caps settings looks just <br>ugly. check the pdf sean mentioned <a href=http://www.geocities.com/ehomine/maest.pdf target=_blank>here</a>. <br> <br> <br><i>>Some of its characters could be a bit narrower, <br>the bowls of P and R a little smaller.</i> <br> <br>i've already tried some variations in UC, and i think <br>they should be wide. i'll search the old caps in my <br>files to show you. <br> <br> <br><i>>variation in the spacing rhythm</i> <br> <br>this is just bad spacing. it wasn't supposed to be so <br>irregular, so i'm going to fix it. ;) <br> <br> <br><i>>n/u problem</i> <br> <br>i'm with sean: this doesn't bother me either. <br> <br> <br><i>>bottom of your lc "c" and "e"</i> <br> <br>maybe it can be extended just a little. this can be <br>improved with a good spacing, too, i think. <br> <br> <br><i>>Preissig</i> <br> <br>this one i knew. great typeface. <br> <br> <br><i>>rather like Maest at smaller sizes.

<div class=commentbody><i>>n/u problem <br>i'm with sean: this doesn't bother me either.</i> <br> <br>I'm not sure whether it is a matter of you being bothered <br>or a matter of testing actual readers to see if there <br>may be a problem here.(*) (I'm using the conditional <br>since the first time around.) Type, like any kind of <br>design, demands testing. Again, depending on what one <br>expects from one's typeface (no need to test anything <br>when it's only a vehicle for self-expression ;). Also: <br>one may well choose sometimes to enhance a stylistic <br>aspect in [slight] detraction from a functional one. In <br>a face like Maest - largely driven by a formal principle <br>- this would be a perfectly valid decision, btw. <br> <br> <br><i>>variation in the spacing rhythm <br> <br>this is just bad spacing. it wasn't supposed to be so <br>irregular, so i'm going to fix it. ;) <br> <br>>if there really was a consistant up and down or <br>at least irregualar action/flow of line. <br> <br>good point tiffany. i think i'm just going to make the <br>characters' baselines more regular</i> <br> <br>In the s there is certainly a spacing problem. But in <br>both the aspects above I'd be careful not to regularize <br>it <i>too</i> much. It could lose some of its charm. ;) <br> <br>abra</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>...testing actual readers... <br> <br>Agreed. The key word here is readers. <br>Not designers or craftsmen.</i> <br> <br>Yes! Peer criticism and "opinions" can never <br>pass for testing!

Would you accept that <br>the opinion of <i>one</i> reader, who, not by chance, <br>is also a type designer, can pass for testing? <br>I don't think so. One fundamental rule of testing, <br>btw (and not that it matters here), is that you <br>don't ask the subject's opinion. You <i>observe</i> <br>his or her behaviour in a number of controlled <br>situations. But this is idle talk, really.

<div class=commentbody>> The key word here is readers. <br> <br>Well, agreed. But readers (which I prefer to call "users", since there's more to communication than reading) don't design their own stuff. Designers do that for them. And the point is that a real designer is not an artist because an artist's main motivation is self-expression. That doesn't mean there's no art in design - not at all. In fact there is unavoidably art in anything a human does - which is a good thing. The main difference between Art and Craft is <i>motivation</i>. <br> <br>Testing is exactly something that a designer needs to do but an artists will not. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo: <br> <br>About your caps: haven't looked at the PDF <br>yet, but from your gif I think I rather prefer <br>the narrower version. That doesn't mean it <br>couldn't be a tad less narrow than in 01. <br> <br><i>Re: testing actual readers... <br>does anyone actually do that? <br>i really want to know if you have <br>any experience doing it.</i> <br> <br>I did it when I was developing Houaiss but <br>not systematically and not in the scale I would <br>have liked - there was no budget for that. <br> <br>Considering how type design is conducted <br>nowadays (generally small firms, mostly <br>one-person firms) I don't think formal testing <br>is really something that is done. I'm not sure <br>about larger and more organized firms like <br>FontBureau. Going back to the typology above, <br>there is a <i>craftsman</i>'s spirit in the thing - <br>and craftsmen don't conduct tests, they rely <br>on their ingrained experience (what passes for <br>intuition) for decisions. <br> <br>But one could argue that testing should be <br>as important as it is, for instance, in <br>automobile design (it was Otl Aicher, I think, <br>who said that designing a typeface is like <br>designing a car). <br> <br>I'd like to go back for a moment to the n/u <br>question and the small montage I made with <br>your type, that was not commented: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7890.gif alt=n/u> <br> <br>What's interesting here is that the same glyph <br>can stand for two different characters and <br>remain perfectly legible, without <i>confusion</i>, <br>depending only on context and lexicon (this is <br>the principle that was taken to its painful limit <br>in Tobias Frere-Jones's <i>Sum of the Parts</i>). <br> <br>This means that, by itself, it's not unambiguously <br>decipherable. Is this a problem? In most typefaces <br>it would be. You could, just for fun, conduct a <br>test with this glyph. For instance: are your <br>Japanese grandparents still alive? Do they read <br>Portuguese? (badly, I suppose?) You could prepare <br>some sample texts, including "trap" words where <br>this glyph could be read either way and see what <br>they make of them. Do the same thing with young, <br>competent readers (aren't these two adjectives <br>contradictory? ;) and see what you get. Have fun.</div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks rodolfo and hrant. sorry for not replying it sooner. <br> <br> <br><i>>About your caps: haven't looked at the PDF <br>>yet, but from your gif I think I rather prefer <br>>the narrower version. That doesn't mean it <br>>couldn't be a tad less narrow than in 01.</i> <br> <br>i'll try new variations... <br> <br> <br><i>>I did it when I was developing Houaiss but <br>>not systematically and not in the scale I would <br>>have liked - there was no budget for that.</i> <br> <br>what do you mean "not systematically"? <br>if you had no budget in that huge project, i <br>wonder how i was supposed to do it for my small <br>project. ;) <br> <br> <br><i>>Considering how type design is conducted <br>>nowadays (generally small firms, mostly <br>>one-person firms) I don't think formal testing <br>>is really something that is done. I'm not sure <br>>about larger and more organized firms like <br>>FontBureau.</i> <br> <br>this is just what i expected. <br> <br> <br><i>>Going back to the typology above, <br>>there is a craftsman's spirit in the thing - <br>>and craftsmen don't conduct tests, they rely <br>>on their ingrained experience (what passes for <br>>intuition) for decisions.</i> <br> <br>there are intuitive <i>and</i> logical solutions in maest, <br>like any other typeface. <br> <br> <br><i>>I'd like to go back for a moment to the n/u <br>>question and the small montage I made with <br>>your type, that was not commented:</i> <br> <br>i didn't comment that because i needed to <br>think more about it. <br>but i liked the montage. ;) <br> <br> <br><i>>What's interesting here is that the same glyph <br>>can stand for two different characters and <br>>remain perfectly legible, without confusion, <br>>depending only on context and lexicon (this is <br>>the principle that was taken to its painful limit <br>>in Tobias Frere-Jones's Sum of the Parts). <br>>This means that, by itself, it's not unambiguously <br>>decipherable. Is this a problem? In most typefaces <br>>it would be. <br>> <br>>This is exactly the difference between legibility and readability in a font.</i> <br> <br>i think hrant's words are better: instead of "confusion x <br>function", let's call it "readability x legibility". in <br>rodolfo's montage, both words are readable. but <br>"function", where [n=flipped u], is more legible: <br>anyone can tell which one is n and which one is u. in <br>the word "confusion", where [u=n], we have <br>ambiguity, but we are still able to read and <br>understand it. <br> <br>in the actual font, n differs from u, but i guess for <br>some people it is too close to their own "self- <br>conscious" image of an u. that's why rodolfo pointed <br>it in "Ninfa". in the other hand, as we know, reading <br>is not a fully "conscious" task, and that's why i think <br>the original n/u works. it will work even better in <br>small (text) sizes, as sean commented before, <br>probably because reading it requires less visual <br>"consciousness" than reading in bigger (display) <br>sizes. <br>(is this making any sense? ;) <br> <br> <br><i>>You could, just for fun, conduct a <br>>test with this glyph. For instance: are your <br>>Japanese grandparents still alive? Do they read <br>>Portuguese? (badly, I suppose?). You could prepare <br>>some sample texts, including "trap" words where <br>>this glyph could be read either way and see what <br>>they make of them. Do the same thing with young, <br>>competent readers (aren't these two adjectives <br>>contradictory? ;) and see what you get. Have fun.</i> <br> <br>i think the "young competent readers" test was already <br>done. i showed it (roughly the same sample i posted <br>here) to a few non-designer colleagues, and nobody <br>complained about anything. actually, they seemed <br>like don't care about it. i'll try showing it to older <br>people (not my grandparents; they barely know <br>portuguese). <br> <br></div>

A Latin sample text <br>or a series of isolated words aren't testing anything. (And <br>"opinions" or the lack of "complaints" are useless.) You have <br>to have a true text sample in the subjects's language, <br>something that she or he would actually read. Running the <br>risk of sounding like Hrant myself, something that could be <br>read "immersively" (though that will hardly be the case in a <br>test). <br> <br>As I think I have already proven, the n glyph can also <br>stand for an u, so you'd have to have words that explore <br>this ambiguity, for the test to have any interest and be <br>fun. That's were the catch is. BTW, don't think of Houaiss <br>as an example. Real-world projects, with tight deadlines, <br>are very often less open to this sort of experiment.

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps try typesetting various words with <br>the "n/u" comparison to see if ambiguity <br>will truly be a problem. <br> <br>Try words such as: <br> <br>annual <br>annular <br>gnu / gun <br>nuclear / unclear <br>nonnuclear <br>nonunified <br>noun <br>nuisance <br>nunu <br>unnumerical <br>unannounceable <br> <br>If it still proves to be a problem, I imagine <br>the problem can be easily corrected <br>by slightly openiing the "curves" in the "u" <br>and "n", and adjusting how the broken "curve" <br>joins to the stem. <br> <br>I really like this font, and I'd love to know <br>when it's finished and released. <br>This is one I'd definitely use. <br> <br>David <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know - it used to be a lot less commercial. Plus when I started watching Ferrari wasn't polluting* it. Hilfiger as a sponsor indeed... Anyway, I'm attracted to dangerous sports. Like alpine skiing really turns me on. <br> <br>* Actually, they were polluting the tracks: they would consistently explode mid-race and leave Agip all over... <br> <br>But actually the moment I was hooked was during the Mexico race of '86. Senna put harder compound tires on the left than on the right, because the track was mostly right turns... And he won (of course). Senna was different. That Donnington wet race in '93 was just alien. Anyway, the extreme technical aspect gets me. Which is why I never watch Indy racing (or whatever it's called now): it's 19th century tug-boat racing. <br> <br>Plus, once you go to an actual race (my first was in '90) it becomes just out of this world. A friend had brought a camcorder, and it stopped working from the noise vibrations. <br> <br>I have autographs of Prost, Hakkinen and Wendlinger (don't ask), and I've come within 3 yards of Senna, after he won in Monaco in '93 - that was a miraculous race. Aaah, the days. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo, <br> <br>With all this discussiou oops... discussio<i><b>n</b></i> over the "n". <br>No one commented on your second PDF - the one <br>with other versions or stages that your design <br>has seen. <br> <br>I think the caps in 2 are great! For me, they <br>really add to the rhythm. Look at the "M" in <br>"Midas" for instance. In 2 it flows really nice. <br>While in 4, I sort of pause when I reach it. I am <br>not saying 4 is is not pretty I just think 2 might <br>be a bit more consistent in expressing the <br>personality of Maest. But it really depends on what <br>your goals are. I think you mentioned that you were <br>really trying to be disciplined in your design. <br>I say loosen up a bit and let the type face design <br>itself just a little bit more. <br> <br>You could take 2 even further and create <br>swash characters as an addition. That would <br>be really cool! In addition this could help to <br>separate it even further from the designs that <br>where mentioned earlier. <br> <br>But then again 2 will raise even more legibility issues. <br>Do the "I", "J", and "T" look too much alike? And then you <br>have the whole "n" story all over again. What a story it told. <br> <br>I think that UC "U" would look cool and be more calligraphic <br>with a stem coming down the on the right. Like a LC. <br> <br>Thanks for posting your second PDF. I really <br>like it. <br> <br>-smc</div>

<div class=commentbody>thank you, sean. <br> <br>I think the "M" in 02 is very nice too, but the hardest thing is <br>to make the other Uc characters coherent with it. Frankly, I <br>don't have any idea of how to do it. Btw, that's the same <br>problem in 04. <br>For example, "A" and "B" just don't get along. It seems like "A" is <br>one font, and "B" is another. I think the same thing happens with <br>other "round" characters, as "B", "D", "P", "R" and "S". I just need <br>to spend more time on this. <br> <br>But I liked your idea of making swash characters.
