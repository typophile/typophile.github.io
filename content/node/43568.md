body: "Electro Musician Justice has a few videos swimming around Youtubes, thought
  I'd post them there. \r\n\r\nThey both incorporate a beautiful level of graphics,
  D.A.N.C.E. using custom (or the appearance of) t-shirts and animation and DVNO using
  graphics, type and animation.\r\n\r\nD.A.N.C.E. : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo_QVq2lGMs\r\n\r\nDVNO:
  http://youtube.com/watch?v=e_XzCR2MbrU \r\n\r\nEnjoy."
