  is a font that was apparently modified from another one. I need to know what font
  the original was. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53029.gif"
  alt="hipderive"> <BR> <BR>And if you feel inclined to comment about how good/bad
  the derivation is, feel free. Thanks much! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: It definitely looks inspired by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/handel-gothic/light/testdrive.html?s=freedom+and+capability&amp;p=48">Handel
    Gothic</a> to me, although there might be something even closer from an independent
    foundry. <BR> <BR>Also, it looks to me like the figures were just optically scaled
    down from cap height. They look too puny.

  body: There&#39;s something really unsettling about the way the horizontal strokes
    are thicker at the bottom than at the top of the characters. It feels like a mistake.
    <BR> <BR>It looks to me a bit like an old film font called Modula &#40;not the
    Emigre one&#41;.
