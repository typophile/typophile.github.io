body: "Im curious if anyone on this board has experience in verbal (actually written
  communication) writing for development of Corporate Brand Platforms.\r\nFor example:
  Positioning Line; Purpose Statement; Mission Statement; Corporate Culture Statement;
  etc.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to engage in a little offline/email based dialog, due to
  the privacy of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nPlease email me if you interested.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    the writing end and do a bit writing now and then.
