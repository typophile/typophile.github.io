  body: "VX,\r\nI guess actually there's no font used for the ASUS logo letters.\r\nIt
    is only a non typographic design that, from my humble point of view, lacks of
    some typographic attributes: unions between curved and linear strokes are inconsistently
    sharp, shapes are imbalanced, spacing is  poor.\r\nIf you need a complementary
    face for it, I suggest you any light sans typo (Eurostyle would be fine) that
    barely resembles the characters but contrasts in weight as well, too.\r\n\r\nMarcelo
