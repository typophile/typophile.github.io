  I am wondering is why the type explaining the story was sprawled across the whole
  screen so that i had to read a line scan my head back to the left and make sure
  i went to the correct line each time...\r\n\r\nAlso In the opening credits, why
  did every letter connected to an E have to be a ligature?\r\n\r\n(Waiting to see
  how long before this thread gets off typography and debates the movie/ pets/ etc.
  (not that i mind))"

  body: lol too bad I didn't take my digital camera to see the movie and have it ready
    to shoot... My point is for those who see the movie tell my why all the E's have
    ligatures and why they made the type so hard to read for the back story.

  body: "Just came back from the movie. Well, as J said, there lots of ligatures all
    over the opening credits. All the upper terminals of a particular letter such
    as T, E, S etc. will be added longer to be joined with the following letters,
    (CAPITAL LIGATURES?!) not the letters before it as far as i remember. Oh yeah,
    they're outlined... Not filled up with the trademarked Daily Planet's steel blue
    color. Also, the ending credits seems to be done pretty bad too.\r\n\r\nMy guess
    is that the best type in the movie is on Lex Luther's boat. ;) "

    credits. Was the geometric sans type Gotham?\r\n\r\nThe ligatures were weird though...maybe
    it was done for the sake of doing a type treatment? Or was it done as homage to
    Superman I and II? The effects for the opening credits were done 1970's style(blue-laser-zoom
    away, as in the previous movies) but I don't know with the ligatures. "

      don't have the same weird capital ligatures that the new movie has...\r\n---\r\n"

    body: "I finally got around to checking out the new Superman Returns movie.\r\n\r\nI
      was a little put off by the handling of the opening titles, as well as the rest
      of what I thought was a highly derivative movie. I'll leave the rest of the
      actual movie review stuff for more movie review oriented people. Let's just
      talk about the type.\r\n\r\nI've never been able to pin down exactly what typeface
      was used in the glorious opening titles of the 1978 edition of \"Superman: The
      Movie.\" It looks a bit like Gill Sans, but then has a bit of Frutiger in it...in
      the end, I don't know. It was still really great. I was only 11 years old when
      watching the Christopher Reeve version of \"Superman\" for the first time and
      I was just blown away by it -right from the opening title sequence. There is
      a joke in Hollywood: \"the fancier the movie titles, the more terrible the movie.\"
      Not sure if that's true, especially when many of the posters are just set lockstep
      in Trajan. But \"Superman: The Movie\" is a guilty pleasure of mine. I watch
      it on DVD and think about riding my bike over bike ramps and crap like that.\r\n\r\nThe
      then fledgling R/Greenberg and Associates put together one of the greatest movie
      title sequences of the 2nd half of the 20th century. I watch it on DVD and still
      get exhilarated by it. It's just cool.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2006.\r\n\r\nFirst,
      they don't match the correct font even though they're trying to make this movie
      into a legitimate sequel to the 1978 and 1981 versions. Gotham is a very good
      typeface. But it is still not the correct font. Superman lives in \"Metropolis.\"
      Batman lives in \"Gotham City.\" Why didn't \"Batman Begins\" use Gotham for
      its type? I digress.\r\n\r\nThen we have to factor in the EXTREMELY irritating
      move of the effects house or whoever rendered this title sequence in doing it
      at too LOW a level of resolution. Did anyone else see all the pixellation all
      over those outlined titles, or was it just me? Not everything \"digital\" equals
      perfect. R/Greenberg and Associates did their opening title sequence BETTER
      and more SMOOTHLY waaaay back in 1978. Yet today, here in 2006, we are way smack
      in the land of pixellated alias-land. Really horrible. Flicker those pixels!\r\n\r\nOn
      top of that, the whole opening title sequence had a pace to it more frantic
      and fast-forward sped-up than most rap gangsta wannabe music videos MTV even
      bothers to play anymore. Everything was firing by so fast I thought I was looking
      at miniature planets or some kid's marbles in a microscope. It was embarrasing.
      Have any of these guys ever thought about a term called \"pacing\" or ever concentrating
      on a shot for more than 6 frames of celluloid? Gigantic objects, such as a planet,
      have to move by the camera sloooooly. If it shoots by in only 5 frames it has
      the scale of a soccer ball. Arrgh!\r\n\r\nI see this kind of dreck happening
      and it makes me feel like all the \"DIGITAL\" tools we have at our use these
      days have made a lot of people retardedly lazy. They don't follow any of the
      rules those who had to live under the limits of the analog realm had to follow.
      Just throw anything at it and caboose it with that \"digital\" word. Blah!\r\n\r\nDigital,
      analog, I'd just like for these movie people to start doing their jobs right
      again!"

  body: "I saw the movie in IMAX 3-D on opening weekend and didn't notice the pixelation
    Bobby did, and that was on a 6-story-tall screen. Also, reading the backstory
    title card didn't seem overly laborious on such a giant screen, but I do remember
    thinking they should have split the text onto two cards rather than one.\r\n\r\nI
    do remember reading (in Entertainment Weekly, I believe) that the director intended
    the titles to be a homage to Superman I and II's swooshing blue outline type.\r\n\r\n(btw,
    the 3-D part amounted to only 20 minutes or so, mostly action sequences. Very
    cool for most of the scenes, but I forgot to take off my glasses after one scene.)\r\n\r\n--m"

    produced the new opening titles. As a tribute to one of the greatest opening titles
    in the last forty years, I thought they did a swell job.\r\n\r\nI wasn't thrilled
    about the large block of prologue text that opens the movie, but it was short
    and non-intrusive. The most annoying part was seeing DC Comics' atrocious new
    logo before it -- Milton Glaser, we miss you!\r\n\r\nAs far as typography in the
    rest of the film, did anyone else notice that The Daily Planet's signage and globe
    were set in Broadway (or some similar Art Deco typeface)? Nice attention to detail,
    I thought -- it resembles the banner type on the original issues of <em>Action
    Comics</em>.\r\n\r\nI can't wait to see the movie again in IMAX."

  body: "I was in Colorado Springs over this past weekend. So I took the opportunity
    to watch \"Superman Returns\" in IMAX at the Cinemark theater there (to see if
    there would be any visual improvement over what I saw in 35mm).\r\n\r\nThe pixelation
    in the opening titles was even more obvious than in 35mm. I even saw vertical
    dark lines separating the light pixel lines on those opening title letters. The
    fast foward acid trip pacing of those titles made it difficult to \"read\" objects
    like planets as they sped across the huge screen.\r\n\r\nThe generally blurry
    nature of image detail in this movie seems to work as a good case study that movies
    shot in HDTV videotape format do not work well blown up to IMAX sized screens.
    Many objects on various sets in this movie that would normally be well in focus
    if shot in IMAX or just 35mm were a blur with \"digital.\"\r\n\r\nThere's a lot
    of digital-based tools which have greatly improved filmmaking and many other creative
    endeavors. But shooting major feature films on video is proving to be, at least
    for now, a big step backward in terms of quality. It takes more than 2000 columns
    of pixels to be competitive with 35mm film."
