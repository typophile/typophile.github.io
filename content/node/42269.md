  I am working on. It is for a packaging range and I need to find a font which looks
  like French handwriting. Of course REAL writing would be great but 1. I don't know
  anyone French 2. Will need to be able to add to this range in years to come so therefore
  need consistency.\r\n\r\nI'v looked on da font and Armandine and Valerie are pretty
  good. Here are some examples of something lovely attached (have I done it right??)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  can you suggest anything else?\r\nThanks, Caroline\r\n\r\n\r\n"
