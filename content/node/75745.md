body: "Through the course of doing some internet research on French Typography, I
  happened upon a posting that showed a typeface that was inspired/based on a French
  Modern typeface. It was designed for a window installation. The second photo shows
  the lettering in the window. It sort of looked like the Shiseido logo only the letters
  were \"hollow\" and the S was more upright and rounded like a traditional S. Somehow
  I did not grab the image or a screenshot or a bookmark for this type. The copy that
  accompanied this post (or was just on the same page. i'm not sure if the copy actually
  had anything to do with the images) stated something about collaborating with jay
  z. (In my mind it was \"so what made you want to collaborate with jay z\", like
  it was from an interview with the designer) i've spent the last three days trying
  to track down this posting and i'm starting to think that i may have just made it
  up in my head completely. if anyone out there has seen this, please, for the love
  of all things designery, let me know.\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n[[http://www.realself.com/files/shiseido_Logo.gif]]\r\n\r\nthe
  attached S is a sketch of what i remember the S looking like"
