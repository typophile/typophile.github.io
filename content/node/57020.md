  at the moment.\r\nI have enclosed a screenshot of a portion of the web page being
  developed.\r\nThe font I am looking for is for the PORTFOLIO title and I will then
  use it for all the menus.My idea is a capital letter, block typeface , but I am
  not sure which one could be the best choice.Here I am using a mac system font named
  STHeiti.\r\nI will apreciate any suggestion.\r\nSilvia"

  body: Is there a special reason you want to use a Chinese font? Is your portfolio
    bilingual? STHeiti is a Chinese font that has Western characters in addition to
    the Chinese. Unless you need to use Chinese text alongside Italian text, you should
    probably choose a Latin-based typeface. The latin characters in your sample image
    look a lot like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/futura/fonts/">Futura</a>.

  body: "Hi Ricardo, thanks.The simple reason why I used STHeiti is because I liked
    how it looked. :-)\r\nI haven't found a better looking Latin-based typeface. :-(\r\nI
    use Futura a lot, actually, in my correspondence (invoices, etc) this is why I
    am sick of it, though it is gorgeous.\r\nAny suggestions? "

  body: "Hi Silvia,\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm just influenced by the image in your portfolio,
    but how about a didone? <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Ambroise/\">Ambroise</a>
    perhaps? Or would that be too delicate?\r\n\r\nAnd do you have a special reason
    for putting 'woman' (the Chinese character)?\r\n"

  body: Hi Josef, Ambroise is very elegant, indeed. What I am looking for is more
    of a block typeface.To answer your question, the nu character is indeed my logo,
    we are an all-female team, this is why.
