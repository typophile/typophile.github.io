  needed upgraded typographic identity that looks less dated, less ethnic, and bolder.
  must accompany exsisting Zoraster logo. Top version with lower case Y just didn&#39;t
  quite work. Client choose bottom logo.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36969.jpg"

  body: I&#39;m not quite sure what you are wanting a crit for. Is this a done deal
    already, or is it still evolving. To bad they you can&#39;t just loose the bird.  <BR>
    <BR>The space between the Y and A is to tight. Why is the word guide in purple.
    The purple seems a little dull in relation to the black. I dig the type face.
    It seems like the logo needs to be bolder, or if not bolder smaller.

  body: 'Ole, the only thing I would look into for your comp is &#40;not a rug pattern&#41;
    but a rug texture behind your graphics. Its a little cold and austeer. As for
    the old brochures: Tacky use of drop shadows and squooshing of Tiffany is just
    disgusting.'

  body: Hey Sorry Ole, when I posted my message all I could see was the top logo and
    brochure. I couldn&#39;t see the old versions. You really made some changes for
    the better. I do like the top first cover over the second.

  body: 'Yeah. Tiffany doesn&#39;t like to be squooshed very often. Hehe. ;&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Version 1: Is the little character part of the logo at all? If not I think
    it is unnecessary.  <BR> <BR>Version 2: I think the lines are superfluous and
    remove from the organic other-wordliness of the rest of the design. I wonder if
    instead of black you use another red/brown color?'

  body: 'Hi Tiffany. <BR>Version.1-The Zoraster character has to be part of it and
    I was not allowed to simplify it/ or re-render it as vector.  <BR>Version.2-I
    think you have a point about the lines. I took them from other comps &#40;not
    shown&#41;, but I think you are right-not needed. Background is dark brown not
    black &#40;perhaps poor color compression for web post&#41;. A redish tone brown
    would properly be even nicer. Thanks for the critique. '

    mushy. <BR>But I wonder why the curvy &#34;Y&#34; wasn&#39;t chosen - it fits
    <i>so</i> well to me. <BR> <BR>The lines: I actually think they make sense in
    the context of rugs, but maybe make them slightly &#34;shaky&#34;, organic &#40;and
    thicker&#41;, instead of totally rigid. <BR> <BR>&#62; Tiffany doesn&#39;t like

    bothers me. It either needs to be the full width of the logotype or set as a watermark

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> WHy don&#39;t you try to keep the curly crossbar &#40;and
    maybe make it subtler&#41; but raise it&#39;s right end so that it intersects
    the right stem of the first A a bit higher? <BR> <BR>Also, if you plan to use
    rounded shapes as design elements, I think you should soften a bit the letter
    shapes &#40;look at British Airways logo and Mylius font&#41;.'

  body: 'Futher explanation and responses to posts. <BR>Arya wanted to modernise and
    synchronize their identity witout modifying the Zoraster icon they already use.
    As I discovered once I got started was that the sacred geometry and symbology
    associated with the character could not be modified, as there was a reason for
    everything in it. Although I would have liked to re-render it in vector for userbility
    and refinement I was discouraged to do so by client.  <BR> <BR>The comps shown
    were really my first attempt at this to show client some direction. I banged this
    out the same night after our initial brief 10 minute meeting.  <BR>The next day
    when we had a real meetiung scheduled I was surprised to discover client liked
    it all as is &#40;top version&#41;.  <BR>In some strange way disappointing as
    I like many other typophiles really enjoy the refinement aspect of a project like
    this. <BR> <BR>One issue is that we are doing mostly trade, and what was not determined
    was $ exchange in our short 10 min. meeting. I trust this client because of the
    referral, so I went ahead with comps as shown. <BR>So what now? Well I have approval
    and exchange negotiated, so I will continue with content. <BR> <BR>I agree the
    &#34;A&#34;s aret not perfect &#40;btw I enjoyed your comment about heavy metal
    Marius-I can see where you how you see the associated, at least if the type is
    isolated&#41;.  <BR>Black is to stark-&#34; It always expresses suffering and
    struggle&#34; I don&#39;t agree, Pirates always seemed to be having a good time-just
    kidding, anyway in final version they will be a warm dark reddish black/maroon.
    <BR> <BR>About spot color on &#34;Guide&#34; - just a comp to show client what
    we could use. It will be solid-thanks Chase a good observation. <BR>I does lokk
    a bit off. <BR> <BR>A word of advice. Trades can be nice but be careful-it is
    not a good practise to get in the habit of doing so, especially if you have a
    sales rep. '
