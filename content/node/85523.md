  is a bit upscale, but also a pragmatic character, as one who loves beautiful things.
  Good food but no frills. A good conversation with friends while enjoying a drink,
  the latter in moderation. Athletic as it is, it happily wears sturdy shoes that
  can take a beating - it provides a stable sense and it makes you feel comfortable
  while walking your dog in the Dutch polders. Eastburgh has a sense of humor with
  its frolic e and busty g, Y and y. It is somewhat cocky with his tight j, f and
  J and the stinging A, W, V, W, V and M. And then the N, which is not to be pushed
  around: simultaneously blunt and sharp.\r\n\r\nNow available at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/atelier/eastburgh/|MyFonts.com]]"
