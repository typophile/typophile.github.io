  body: "Yeah, I know, just can't believe that the person who originally designed
    it did that much work to it - easy to extend the 'd' and 'c' but not to modify
    the 'a' or 'd', also the top of the 'c' slightly curves which I can't find anywhere.\r\n\r\nThanks
    anyway!\r\n\r\nH"

    Well, I just searched for faces similar to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-bauhaus/\">ITC
    Bauhaus on MyFonts</a> and found <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/victory/bayer-sans/\">Bayer
    Sans</a> -- it's a lot closer to the face used for the logo!"
