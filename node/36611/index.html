  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I know next to nothing about typesetting and found this site from Wikipedia.  I have an idea that I think requires some unusual sorts and I would be extremely grateful for any help this group could provide.</p>
<p>The organisation I work for, QMI Solutions, has a semi-experimental machine called an Incremental Sheet Former.  You can see an article on the technology here:
[[http://www.qmisolutions.com.au/article.asp?aid=160]]</p>
<p>It works by using a solid stylus (e.g. 20mm diameter ball nose) to form metal over a plug.  In those pictures it&rsquo;s making our stock demonstration piece, &ldquo;The Face&rdquo;.  The CNC control means infinite flexibility from CAD models.</p>
<p>What I would like to do for our demonstrations is to form &ldquo;The Face&rdquo;, then have the name of whichever company it&rsquo;s for to be formed as well.  Now that I&rsquo;ve done my 10 minutes research on Wikipedia, I think I at least know the words to use to ask the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
I would have a forme with say a 12 character capacity on our plug.</li>
<li>The sorts may be around 50mm/2 inches in height.</li>
<li>The font would suit tracing with a 20mm ball nose tool (possibly a smaller tool could be used), which means there are no tight concave sections.</li>
<li>Because the metal is being pressed over the font it needs to be "right way around" instead of mirrored.</li>
<li>For bonus points, the font is designed such that there is a common joining point between all the letters so that the outline of a word is continuous rather than having to trace each letter individually.  This may mean the font is a script rather than a print, or it may mean there is a design feature like the lines joining characters on car badges.</li>
<li>For even more bonus points, the set is available commercially or second hand somewhere.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Now I&rsquo;m stuck.  Would anyone here be able to point me in the right direction?</strong></p>
<p>Ideally we would be able to buy a set from somewhere (anywhere!).  Alternatively if 2D or 3D CAD models (or even font files) of a suitable font could be obtained we could have them machined.  I would have to find out how many of each character is a good number.</p>
<p>2D or 3D CAD shape definitions (in whatever format) would be required so that we could created the toolpath in our CAM software.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help at all,
James McIntosh</p>

<p>Sounds like you need to speak with someone who can design a custom font for you to best met your needs. Custom solutions are usually expensive</p>
