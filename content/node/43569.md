body: "Hi all. I am new to FL. I have designed a font in illustrator and am importing
  it as an illustrator EPS file. This is for a uni project on a tight deadline.\r\n\r\nI
  have looked at similar blogs on here but still unsure what to do.\r\n\r\nthe warning
  message:\r\n''Some glyphs in the font that is being exported contain open contours
  which cannot be exported as open into the font file''\r\n\r\nI have clicked the
  'Contour' tab and selected 'correct connections', 'join broken contours' and 'close
  open contours' but this seems to have no effect.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get
  round this or will I have to redraw in fontlab?\r\n\r\nthanks"

    automatically. You should check your drawings in wireframe mode to make sure you
    have all your shapes closed. On a PC, Ctrl+Y is the shortcut for the Outline preview.\r\n\r\n"

  body: this is the 'B' so far, made up of individual blocks. I tested grouping them
    all together but this has the same result

  body: "How big your Illustrator drawings are? Enlarge your letters say 250mm height
    and try copy pasting the outlines directly into the FontLab. If that doesnt work,
    try welding all your blocks with the pathfinder and export it again.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It might be the little dots you can see in each of the rectangles. Illustrator
    (by default) places individual points at the center of shapes created using the
    rectangle tool and these can be carried over to FontLab when you import the art.
    You can eliminate them in Illustrator by selecting everything, opening the Attributes
    palette and clicking on the "Don't Show Center" button (middle left part of the
    palette). If you already got everything in FontLab, you'll have to manually delete
    them all.

  body: The illustrator vectors are 150mm approx. i have enlarged one to 250mm. the
    warning box appears again. Do the blocks need to be outlines or rasterized in
    any way?

  body: "Hi Ross,\r\n\r\nI saw the Eps file you sent me, it has those crop marks if
    you have noticed. When I import this Eps file into FontLab, those marks comes
    with it as well. You have to delete those crop marks in the FontLab. or else release
    the crop area in the Illustrator file itself. I have marked them in the red.\r\n\r\nHere
    is your Illustrator file\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/R1_6648.jpg]\r\nAnd
    this is how it looks when you import it into the FontLab.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/R2_3477.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    hope this will help.\r\n\r\n"

    I select 'File', 'Generate font' or 'Generate All' to see if it will work as an
