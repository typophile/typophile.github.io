    <BR>this is classic NY lettering... 1984, Brooklyn Heights fire box... IND&#42;500
    tag... taken with a Nikon FM-2 on Polaroid Intant 35mm Slide film &#40;an 80s
    attempt to create quick news/sports film&#41;. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s what
    you want though.  <BR> <BR>the Polaroid slide film was very grainy and looked
    like RGB with a strange diffrent Red channel. Blacks tend to look purple and Red
    is brilliant usually. It is it&#39;s own animal. But for graffiti it is perfect.
    <BR> <BR>the original is 3000px x 2029px  <BR> <BR>Alphabet city is not the place
    I remember it&#39;s now a mall and CGGB&#39;s is now practically the Hard Rock
    Cafe.. they ruined my town.

  body: If its any consolation Vincent, you can still get shot and killed in Alphabet
    City. Although I&#39;ll admit, not as often as 10 years ago. <BR> <BR>ANd while
    the rest of NYC has begun to smell more and more like a mall, the real Alphabet
    City &#40;Avenues A, B, C, and D&#41; could never be mistaken for one. <BR> <BR>Loisada.

  body: I know Rudy put police with dogs in the lower east side and then in the late
    eighties art galleries started opening. I went to see a friends show and it looked
    like a scene from Batman where there were only cops and dogs and clean streets...
    not a bit like the needle park and shooting gallery it use to be. <BR> <BR>But
    I have been told by my old friends that St. Mark&#39;s Place is no longer the
    way it use to look and someone stole the cube at Astor Place. <BR> <BR>vinnie

  body: I&#39;ll have to check for The Alamo &#40;the name of the cube in Astor Place&#41;
    the last time I was there it was in place, but there is a lot of construction
    going on, the  Cooper Union is building a new building. <BR> <BR>As for the galleries
    on the Lower East Side, it is amazing. I remember going down to Rivington Street
    in the late 80&#39;s and thinking I was decending into hell, but now... smell
    the cappucino.  <BR> <BR>Better fed than dead I suppose.

  body: St. Mark&#39;s and the surrounding area is reasonably clean and commercial.  However,
    I&#39;ve never been there when it was anything but. <BR> <BR>The Astor Place cube
    has not been stolen, but it has been removed for cleaning or fixing or something
    official.  In the meantime, there&#39;s a lot of performance art installations
    there.  They&#39;re going to put it back sometime, hopefully soon. <BR> <BR>--an
