  in the Clark's Shoes 'Enjoy Every Step' campaign. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enjoy_6470.jpg]\r\nIdentifont
  and MyFonts came up with Antique Central and 58 Rodeo. They're close but aren't
  rounded and lack the swashes. I thought that perhaps it was a custom job, but then
  I saw the second sample whilst browsing through a magazine. It looked close enough
  to suggest that this could be an actual font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bliss_5755.jpg]\r\nAny
  help gratefully appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBrumble."
