body: "Hello All\u2013\r\nHaving a complete mental block today about a typeface I
  have previously used it on an invite and own it. It's a Tri Line face which isn't
  rounded so unlike Gala or Pump. Quite plain in a way with a bit of a 30s feel to
  it, condensed. I have seen it used before where a designer had knocked some of the
  lines out to create different versions of the face. Any help appreciated, driving
  me up the wall."
