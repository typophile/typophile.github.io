  body: Email notification was down for me for a day or so last week, but it seems
    to be working for me now. But I have a sneaking suspicion that Yves somehow hacked
    into the system and disabled it, effectively reducing his competition. I&#39;m
    on to you, buddy.

    Although, I don&#39;t blame you for casting the suspicious eye toward our resident
