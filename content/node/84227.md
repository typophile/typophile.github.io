body: "Can anyone identify the font in the attached logo? I have found many close
  but not exact. Note that letters are wide, give the appearance of square but with
  rounded corners, and the extender on the \"d\" is relatively short. The \"e\" almost
  seems to be a lighter weight than the other characters. Thank you in advance...
