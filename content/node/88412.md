  body: "Generally these may show up in Google. (For instance, just found Marina from
    Brendel). I don't know how to tell if a design is original (unless I have found
    several lookalikes, then I'm suspicious!) or if it's an authorized copy, or it's
    from a legitimate designer gone out of the business, or if Adobe or Linotype has
    an \"original\" and they have cross-selling agreements. Confusing. \r\n\r\nWonder
    if there is an Original Design list?\r\n\r\nIf a sample matches a knockoff does
    that make the Find evil or the Use evil?"

  body: There's no "evil". But surely there is much confusion.
