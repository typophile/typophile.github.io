  it may be a custom font. The closest I could find was Dear Sarah but that is more
  oblique/slanted than I would like. Any recommendations for other typefaces with
  this organic/handcrafted type of feel? I have looked at the following: Olduval,
  Galahad, Baker Script, Modern Blues, Sunshine and Tree. Basically, I am looking
  for a font to serve as a starting point for a logo for a handmade jewelery (beads,
  etc.) company.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: I wouldn't use Cezanne for a logo. It's been used so often for so many things
    that it will fail at helping to create an original brand.
