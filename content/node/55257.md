  style is very clean.\r\n\r\nI'd like to use the Avante Garde in callout headings,
  to be created as images and placed in side columns on the page . The rest of the
  content, headings, menu, etc. will be in web based Verdana.\r\n\r\nI'm not feeling
  confident in the mix. Verdana, when bolded, looks pretty clunky along side the Avante
  Garde. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n"

    combination of Avant Garde with a different sans-serif will look bad.\r\nGood
    luck!"

    stay away from serif types because they're harder to read online. However, Georgia
    was designed specifically for the web and eliminates such difficulties."
