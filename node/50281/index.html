  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I put Bancroft together years ago with fontographer. I'm in the process of updating it with FontLab to take advantage of the OpenType features. Small caps, OS figures and lots of lower case ligatures.

I am afraid the finer points of OT programming are out of my grasp and I would like to at least get the book weight set up properly before I move on to the medium, bold and italics.

Anybody here have the time and energy to take it out for a spin and look under the hood to let me know where or if I am on the right track?

Email me at robby@woodardworks.com and I'll send you a link to the file.

I'm not sure if I am asking for too much here. If I am, I don't mind talking about what it might cost to make sure things are done right.

Thanks!</div>

When I first started mucking around with them (following the instructions in <em>Learn Fontlab Fast</em> I had it working and tested in under thirty minutes. If your test fonts are working in Indesign things are probably fine. 

But like Christian said, just post the code.</div>

Everything does seem to work in Illustrator and InDesign, on my mac, anyway.

I have it set up so that proportional figures are the default and tabular is an OT feature...

I know this is not standard, but it seems to be working and I think fits in with the attitude of the font.

Thanks for the input!

		<div class="commentbody">Everything looks OK, except 

1. You should change fi and fl in your substitution to f_i and f_l, with no Unicode number. If you want to leave fi and fl in with a Unicode index that's fine, but copy the glyphs, name them f_i and f_l, and switch those.

2. You should switch the double-f's first (or double anything. . .)

e.g.


feature liga { # Standard Ligatures
 # Latin
    sub f f i by f_f_i;
    sub f f j by f_f_j;
    sub f f l by f_f_l;
    sub f f m by f_f_m;
    sub f f n by f_f_n;
    sub f f r by f_f_r;
    sub f f t by f_f_t;
    sub f f u by f_f_u;
    sub f f y by f_f_y;
    sub f i by f_i;
    sub f l by f_l;
    sub f f by f_f;
      .
      .
      .
etc.

Also, you may want to exclude f_i and f_f_i for Turkish via a language tag.

Your oldstyle numbers aren't named properly, IMO. Numbers should be named zero, one, etc., with variants using a period.

I use .op for "oldstyle proportional", .ot for "oldstyle tabular" .lp for lining proportional, and .lt for lining tabular.

so @onum2=[zerooldstyle oneoldstyle twooldstyle threeoldstyle fouroldstyle fiveoldstyle sixoldstyle sevenoldstyle eightoldstyle nineoldstyle numbersignoldstyle dollaroldstyle percentoldstyle perthousandoldstyle centoldstyle sterlingoldstyle yenoldstyle florinoldstyle eurooldstyle];

goes to 

@onum2=[zero.op one.op two.op three.op four.op five.op six.op seven.op eight.op nine.op numbersign.op dollar.op percent.op perthousand.op cent.op sterling.op yen.op florin.op euro.op];

and they need to be so named in the font -- again, with no Unicode index.

I don't think there is a standard for which of the four basic figures sets is the default.
As you say, whichever is most appropriate for the typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, if you set up oldstyle figures as default (as was done e.g. in the Microsoft Corbel and Constantia fonts), please remember to replace then with the lining figures not only in the "lnum" feature but also in the "case" and perhaps also "titl" feature. Microsoft have not done so, and therefore users who activate "all caps" in InDesign, end up with all-uppercase text with oldstyle figures, which is not optimal. They would need to explicitly switch on lining figures as well, which some of them may not be aware of, and there may be OpenType-aware applications that do expose an "all caps" feature but do not expose the different figure styles.
