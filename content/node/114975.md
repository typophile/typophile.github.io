  A FONT HELP SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE? \u2013 YES IT CAN!\r\n\r\n#BUYFONTSSAVELIVES will
  sell typefaces to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support.
  The brainchild of Haymarket Creative Director Paul Harpin, all proceeds are going
  directly to these two great charities. \r\n\r\nThe fund-raising project was inspired
  by Harpin\u2019s niece Laura, who sadly died aged just 26. Paul created a new typeface
  family to sell in her memory. Other type designers and experts are kindly joining
  in to help raise funds.\r\n\r\nThe fonts are available to buy and download from
  www.typespec.co.uk/buyfontssavelives with the initial releases including the following:\r\n\r\nLAURA\r\nA
  new typeface family in four styles \u2013 Plain, Shaded, Ribbon, Stencil \u2013
  twelve weights plus italics in each style. Designed by PAUL HARPIN assisted by PAUL
  HICKSON. \u201CThis is my first ever typeface,\u201D says Harpin, \u201Cand I now
  know how hard type designers work\u201D.\r\n\r\nHESELTINE\r\nKindly donated by LORD
  HESELTINE. Two styles \u2013 Text and Titling. Originally produced as a gift from
  Haymarket Media Group to Lord Heseltine for his 75th birthday. Designed by PAUL
  HICKSON and his wife PATRICIA. For Hezza\u2019s 80th we added italics, for Latin
  plant names.\r\n\r\nMFRED\r\nDonated and designed by MATT WILLEY (assisted by HENRIK
  KUBEL at A2 -TYPE) in honour of his father Nick. This much sought after headline
  font was originally drawn for ELEPHANT magazine, then used in Matt\u2019s PORT magazine
  and has featured in the US edition of WIRED.\r\n\r\nORGANON\r\nKindly donated by
  G-Type's Nick Cooke, this special pack includes the Regular & Bold weights of both
  Organon Sans & Serif which have been designed specifically to complement one another.
  Feature rich OpenType fonts with Small Caps and extended European character sets.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help to spread the word about this campaign or kindly buy one of the fonts. Get
  in touch if you\u2019d like to donate a typeface.\r\n\r\n#buyfontssavelives\r\nwww.typespec.co.uk/buyfontssavelives\r\nwww.buyfontssavelives.com\r\n\r\ne:

    there doesn't seem to be an actual site at www.buyfontssavelives.com"

  body: "Hi Marc, that micro site should be online in the coming days but I don't
    have a hand in that so can't categorically say, however you can view and buy the
    fonts from Typespec here:\r\nhttp://www.typespec.co.uk/buyfontssavelives\r\nThanks
    for the support and spread the word."
