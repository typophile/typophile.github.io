  topic, but I figure there may be greater knowledge of newer fonts here.\r\n\r\n2.
  Really, I did a search before posting.\r\n\r\nThat said, we have to design and set
  a book that uses a significant number of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]
  phonetic characters. There are a few instance of italic; I can fudge these if I
  have to. The book is in French, by the way.\r\n\r\nI know of three serif font families
  with phonetic characters, Gentium, Times, and Stone. I would prefer not to use any
  of these \u2013 the \u201Csample book\u201D the publisher sent was set in Minion.\r\n\r\nSo,
  does anybody know of a serif font family (roman, italic and bold), suitable for
  book work, with phonetic characters, at least in the roman font?\r\n\r\nTIA"

    Modern</a>, <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournalIpa\">Le
    Monde Journal</a>, and Garamond (such as that from the <a href=\"http://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/EAE/\">Encyclopaedia
    Aethiopica</a>).  I would go with Le Monde if the budget allows.\r\n\r\nIPA as
    such isn't set in italic, although such beasts do exist."

    Fedra Serif A Phonetic.</a>\r\n\r\nOr, you might contact Chris Burke. His Parable
    FF was used for the new Concise OED. I don't know, but it looks like  IPA characters
    were made for it.  \r\n\r\nI don't see any sign of the an \"IPA Parable\" on sale
    at Fontshop, but perhaps you could arrange something. Of course, it might be that
    the OED has exclusivity.\r\n\r\nHere's his web site:\r\nhttp://www.hiberniatype.com/index.html"
