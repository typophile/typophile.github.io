body: "Hello Again! Ive been away from the site for a while, but I wanted to know
  if someone more knowledgeable than myself could possibly help.  I am trying to locate
  a digital version of an old metal type that was used for cutting stencils for cemetery
  monument lettering. It was called (as far as my mother recollects) \"Old Monument
  Outline\", and it was (again, according to my mother's sometimes fuzzy memory) produced
  by a company called \"Space-rite\" or \"Space Right\". All I have available (short
  of taking pictures of headstones) is a ghosty rubbing, but it appears to be an old-style
  serif. Distinguishing features include open counters for the 6 and 9 glyphs, ala
  Adobe Garamond.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we have a digital copy of another typeface
  that has to be manually altered to match, but if a digital copy of this actually
  exists, it would be of great help. Ive tried searching for every keyword i can think
  of, to no avail. If anyone could point me in the right direction, I would be eternally
  grateful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rubbing_5496.jpg]"
