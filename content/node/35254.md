  body: "Boy, some graphic designers sure have an inferiority complex, thinly veiled
    behind \"ironic\" self-deprecation.\r\nNow if only they were as magnanimous as
    art directors -- books on graphic design outnumber those on art direction 100
    to one, it isn't taught as a discipline, isn't the subject of PhD theses, and
    doesn't even have a Wiki page. And certainly no Art Direction Museum! Yet those
    noble art directors are quite content with lauding themselves behind the scenes
    at their awards shows or relaxing over drinks at their chateaux, and bravely continue
    to share their designation with peers in movies, TV and video games, rather than
    agonizing over their identity or society's blind eye to their exploits. \r\n\r\nThe
    buzz over Helvetica must really sting the graphic design profession, as their
    tool of choice gets more props than they do. But whose fault is that?"

  body: "<cite>But whose fault is that?</cite>\r\n\r\nI think that the dearth of all
    but the most localized self-promotion by designers probably has a lot to do with
    it. There are still plenty of great freelancers and small design firms out there
    that don\u2019t have a web site and still have no trouble keeping busy at least
    forty hours a week. From what I can tell, most designers are really just happy
    to get their work done and be left alone."

    suppose he does, though with that hair I picture him selling carpet steamers or
    vitamin drinks on late night television. But really, cheeky AIGA intentions aside,
    why Hellfand would associate with such a right wing monster as Stossel is beyond
    me."
