Another freelance Graphic Designer & I have decided to associate,

"fluonoir" means "fluorescentblack" in French.

Thx a lot. Virginie

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmmm, it's not bad but...

I think it's conceptually problematic because there is no such such thing as fluorescent black as the logo so clearly shows in all its normal black and dirty mustardness.

Fluorescent Black as a name feels like you're trying to hard to be clever in some post modern kind of way.

I sort of get it, but just how is a lightning cloud symbolic of fluorescent black?

The cloud could be better. The left bulge feels too big and some curves just look like parts of circles. The bottom curve eats into the lightning's space.

The lightining is dwarfed by the cloud, looks cramped and might be better if the middle 'stroke' didn't have 2 angles. At small sizes the lightning may get lost and the whole logo could look more like a cartoon speech/thought bubble.

I like the font, but I would join the first 'o' to the 'n'. The f is a bit lost and maybe more could be done with the fl ligature. Maybe the terminals of the f and r could end more sharply to echo the lightning.

Sorry. I'm feeling rather picky today.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Let me tell you a little bit more about the name and the logotype : we chose "black" as it's the result of CMY(K) for print and RGB for screen as we're print & web Graphic Designers... The "fluo" thing was kind of a joke since (obviously) fluorescent black doesn't exist, it underlines the "true nature" of our professional activity which is creativity / inventivity. which brings us to the cloud and lightening that clearly evoks that (intense) creative process (cloud = imagination - lightening = idea). Pretty simple, ain't it?... At least, not as pretentious as you seem to think it is. : P</div>

I'm not sure if the colour spectrum effects are cheesey, over the top or just crap, but it does kind of validate the Fluonoir name in a way.

I don't think the name is pretentious. I just wasn't too sure about the nonsensical juxtapostion.

I like the concept of the lightning cloud representing creativity. It makes sense in a nicely poetic way.

BTW In the Chinese I Ching one of the 8 trigrams is Zhèn/Chên, which is thunder (that obviously comes from a lightning cloud) for symbolising the arousing, movement, activity, shock and growth. Which is good :)

BTBTW In my ridiculous youth I got a lightning cloud tattoo :/

I hate gradients and color spectrums. Why are you doing it? Is there a need for it? Why make it so glowy? Out of all of them I prefer the solid black with the white type.
I'd try a lot more typefaces. Why are you sticking to just that?
Why are you not exploring more concepts instead of just sticking with the one you chose?
I think you should push yourself a lot further before deciding on a logo mark.

Gee thanx. No need to sound so surprised ;P

What does "contre toute attente" mean?

<em>I like the spectrum I think it has some kind of 80’s vibe</em>

I think the spectrum colour effect has that French retro dance/funk/disco culture vibe. It made me think of this...

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1upou_justice-dance

How cool is that? Sure is some groovy type in the video too.

Maybe you could try a version of the logo where you loosen it up in a hand drawn funky/graffiti style inspired by some of the stuff in the video. It might give a feeling of spontaneous creative thought better than the clean cut italic font and precise geometry you have now.

If you stick with your rounded terminals on the f and r maybe you could work it so they are positioned at the centre of their respective cloud curve circles.

I look forward to seeing it “improved” as you put it ;)

<em>I suggest you guys post pictures of your (tattoo)</em>

Sorry, my tattoo is only available for private viewings. It's on my penis.

Well, I thought the explanation was a tad pretentious. ;o)

Nothing wrong with the cloud and lightning and a slightly goofy name, though. They work together well...just don't expect clients to 'get' or even care why you came up with the name. ;o)

3. white cloud, black text, flour page

about my last post, I was just trying to throw some suggestions, i wasn't trying to be arrogant. the typeface i think is fine, I just thought that it would be nice to see a bunch of the different typefaces that you tried because we have nothing to really compare it to.

		<div class="commentbody">Randy/Gahz, exactly what colour would the fluorescent ink be and how would it be conveyed on screen?

It would have to be something other than black which would then contradict the name Fluonoir.

Gahz, I didn't suggest that you were arrogant. It was just clear from your questions that you hadn't read the whole thread and made an assumption on how many concepts were explored before this one was posted. See Virginie's third post for her explanation of what the lightning cloud represents.

		<div class="commentbody">One other thought on the type. Usually, trying to transform and italic into a connected script is problematic. In this case it's giving you a zig zag effect that works well with the lightning. The same kind of thing going on here:

http://www.milwaukeetool.com/

The cloud gives the design a playful feeling, whilst the type suggest a more understated approach. Not knowing your combined styles, it's hard to make a recommendation on type. I do think drawing the type from scratch in a more bolder and more lively style (think Calcite or Fakir) would unify the design.

And one other thing: consider connecting fluo and noir as in the *noi* join rather than two separate words. It would enhance the lightning rythm in the italic.

		<div class="commentbody">here are my 2 cents:
-what if the sharpness/roundness of the bolt reflects the shape of dot in the "i" in noir?
-i dont dislike the idea of a flat bottomed cloud, but it starts looking more like a tree than a cloud..(to me)

-although i think people are on the right track telling you to connect fluo-noir, i think its also important to consider those are the 2 words and there is a logical separation.. so i wouldnt be sure that just connecting them is tooootally the right approach

overall its nice, but kind of similar to other styles found in that somewhat cliché "web2.0" look that is EVERYWHERE!

good luck.</div>

The inks are a little on the muddy side, but I am not so sure about the neon rainbows. What about randomly picking from the rainbow?

Also is there any chance you could fine-tune the letters to make them really connect? "fl" seems to be no real ligature, and the connection of "lu" and "ir" are terrible. Maybe you want to consider using Adobe Caflish which provides very nice contextual alternatives that connect perfectly with each other:

Sorry I didn't mean to assume that you didn't try other logotypes and I guess I didn't read the post properly that it was a logo representing two people's collaborative work. So, that doesn't need any more explanations. I thought it was for a client.

The ligature is really nice and the round edges of the type embrace the soft round edges of the cloud and the ligatures do the same with the lightning bolt.

I like the idea of the cloud glowing but not with a million colors. Maybe on black it could be a yellow and on white it could be another color, maybe like a pink or something.</div>

But I think we're gonna stick to the cloud+lightening sign with the typographic signature.

Here is the retouched version. What do you think?
Did you guys prefer when the lightening was imitating the slope of the italic or now that it's parallel to the cloud?

I'll take care of the color/spectrum/gradient thing in a second time.

This looks really classy (I prefer the circles) & definitely suitable for a design studio. The cloud worked as well, but indicated a kind of playfullness which is now replaced by pure class & professionalism (not that the cloud could not work as a professional logo, but it would certainly attract different customers).
The question you need to ask yourself & your partner at this point is what's primary to you 2? Do you opt for the younger playfullness of the cloud or the professional class of your latest design?
Either way, I absolutely LOVE the new circle logo!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Virginie,

i am joining this discussion at a rather late point, but I feel the need to say: Please don't loose that fabulous cloud. When i saw your first post, my initial reaction was "Yes, this i great." It looked fresh without trying to hard or being pretentious. Well done. 

The new logo concepts are good, but in my opinion feel too safe, especially after seeing some of your work on your site. 

I hope you and your partner find a logo that works for both of you.</div>

I do agree that the pictogram is kinda savvy
but I also agree on the cloud&lightening being a bit naive...
I'd like to find "la voie du milieu".
Any thoughts ?

Dear topic contributors,

Thank you all for your help.

We're gonna go for the round pictogram + typographic signature and keep the cloud + lightening for different applications such as the loaders of the website, etc.

Once again, typophile.com rocks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Have you tried combining the 2? You can always opt for 2 different versions: one defined logo & another kind of trademark illustration if you know what I mean? I absolutely love both designs, but I think it's important to think about its purpose & what you're trying to convey which obviously relates to the kind of work you do & the assignments you'll attract.
Even the name is set in a different light with the new logo. With the cloud it worked well in a playful way, but in the new logo, it becomes more abstract. I don't know if this makes any sense at all?
I think using both is a perfect solution & will broaden your  clientele, but I would advice against using them both as a logo in different applications. I'm not sure if that's what you meant or if you also meant using one as a logo & the other as a trademark illustration?
Either way, congratulations on a job well done & good luck with your studio!</div>

Yes the cloud+lightening is going to be used without the typographic signature as some kind of trademark illustration, exactly that.
We thought that it was a shame to "loose" this graphic element, so we just gave it a new usage.

I'm in the middle of setting the logotype use guidelines.
I was wondering if anyone could post one that you think is really complete and well done (a .pdf for example).

Other question, our dear wormwood has disappeared from the surface of this (virtual) earth for a while now, does anyone know if he's ok ?

		<div class="commentbody">You mean an existing one to use as a guideline to see what you need to cover in your styleguide? I'll try to look for one, but basically it covers colours, backgrounds, fonts, use of pictures & a whole bunch of measurements. It can end up getting quite thick even for a seemingly simple housestyle ;-)
Now that you mention it, Wormwood's absence is indeed a little strange, but maybe he took a holiday? You can always contact him to see if he's OK.
I'm glad to hear you're not letting the cloud go to waste & I can't wait to see your upcoming site!</div>

The website will be up and running pretty soon. I'll let you know about the "grand opening / website launch" ;). BTW, do you happen to have a website too?

I've been in contact with wormwood via e-mail but I haven't got any news from him for a week now, and it seems kinda strange since he suddenly stopped his replies in the middle of a conversation... I'm kinda worried...</div>

You're starting to get me a little worried now as well. I can also try to contact him, but I don't think that will make much of a difference. But maybe we're just being paranoid & he's just taking a vacation without his computer? Let's hope so.</div>
