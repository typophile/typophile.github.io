  body: Nope, all his 3s are with curved top. <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90062.html"
    target="_blank"> Concorde</a>, Berthold&#39;s  <BR>alternative for Times, has
    a flat top three too, and I guess  <BR>there must be others. The obvious ones
    being classic  <BR>looking typewriter faces like <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF00153402P2"
    target="_blank"> FF Trixie</a> and <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF01104501P1"
    target="_blank"> FF Elementa</a>. <BR> <BR>I used the FF Trixie one as a French
    &#34;z&#34; for the birth  <BR>announcement of my daughter Eliza. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Uh, just have in mind that that glyph is not a 3, nor a z. <BR>It&#39;s an
    IPA character &#40;I recall Bringhurst says something about it on &#39;Elements&#39;&#41;.
    <BR>You can find that glyph in IPA fonts &#40;there are some free IPA fonts available
    from <a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=12"> SIL</a>&#41;.
