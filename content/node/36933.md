  of symbols brings a new perspective to age old tradition with the introduction of
  66 striking icons.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen these same symbols in various GAP and
  Product (RED) campaigns...but now is your chance to have your own set of these unique
  symbols with just a simple keystroke...\r\n\r\nChoose Adinkra Calabash for the hand-hewn
  quality found in African art, Adinkra FineFine for a clearer and more contemporary
  look or Adinkra WantaWanta to achieve a wax print/batik-like effect that adds a
  certain touch of West African authenticity to any project.\r\n\r\nWould you like
