  body: You are right Jan -and I should have mentioned that in my post- but I haven't
    found any Univers Condensed version to be so close to the sample as Zurich Extra
    Cond (considering the overall compression and the shape of /D & /R).

  body: "Can't agree more on \"PASTIS\", that looks close to Coliseum. I guess they
    used the same typeface for \"DINNER\", we just can't see the small flare serifs
    at this size.\r\nUnfortunately and part of remininding me of Bookman Italic Swash
    (mainly because of swashes), I don't know any typeface, even loosely similar to
    \"RESTAURANT FRANCAIS\". What I've learn from this place is signages are most
    likely always hand-painted/lettered. There's no digital version of it."
