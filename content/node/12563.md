  my fonts I've been using Abobe Type Manager 4.1.  I haven't seen any innovations
  come along but I wanted to ask the community if anyone knew of something better.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n-john"

    Tracker</a> to be very useful. I don't know why no one has responded. I'm a Mac
    user, but a quick search there gave returned <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/php/search.php?PHPSESSID=981ba9cfcba12bf1e7ad90d39aa25e05&mode=basic&action=search&str=font+management&plt%5B%5D=windows&x=0&y=0">these</a>

  body: "IMO, the by far best font manager for Windows currently available is Bitstream
    Font Navigator 5.0. Unfortunately, it's not available stand-alone but only bundled
    with Corel Draw 12. \r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to Linotype releasing FontExplorer
    X for Windows. Currently, Linotype only offers a Mac version of their free font
    manager: http://www.fontexplorer.net/ \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

    shop, I've been using FontExplorer for that purpose on the mac side, but haven't
    seen the feature on most Windows font managers.\r\n\r\nI'd like to point customers
    to a tool on the PC side that'd allow them to discover such information before
    they send jobs to us..."
