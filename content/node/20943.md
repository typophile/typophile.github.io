  body: This is an astonishing album, but unfortunately they used that same typeface
    in orange on a similar textured background at a tiny point size for the credits...
    impossible to read. <em>So</em> frustrating, as I'm really interested in what
    samples they used.

  body: "The typeface was a predigital one called Tasmin Bold. The only digital version
    of Tasmin (and it happens to be the bold, too) I've ever come across is called
    Tango by Softkey/WSI. That's an unholy alliance of ripoff fonts cloners but, again,
    I know of no other version in font form. You can see it here:\r\nhttp://www.fontage.com/pages/tango.html\r\n\r\nFontage's
    webmaster doesn't provide for the download of fonts that she doesn't know for
    certain to be legitimately free. No doubt, however, a Google search formatted
    just so will turn up the font itself."

  body: "You nailed it Mike. It's shown in the Solotype Catalog (p.164) and in one
    of the Dover font books that show complete fonts from the Solotype Catalog. I
    don't know which one offhand, but I used a scan from it for the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html\">showing
    of Tasmin</a> in my Bauhaus Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
