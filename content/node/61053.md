  books about the history of type, are plentiful. But I am looking for some suggestions
  to books on the history of corporate type, and I havent't really found anything
  yet. But then, perhaps it's not a book I need but a quick dig into the collective
  knowledge base that is Typophile.\r\n\r\nIf, by a corporate typeface, I mean a typeface
  commissioned, made and used <em>exclusively</em> for a commercial entity or organization,
  then who made and used the first one? Was it the <em>Romain du roi</em>?\r\n\r\nWhat
  are your favorites through history?\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\u0192"
