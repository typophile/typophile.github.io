body: "I am in the process of creating a vectored version of my signature. So far
  I have only drawn the last name, \"Gray\" but my full name is \"James Gray.\" I
  was hoping to get some feedback early before I spend too much time on it. Should
  I vary the weight more/less, too slanted, change the X-height, legibility... I'm
  not too concerned with staying true to my penmanship because to be completely honest,
  it's a little sloppy. Anyways, with that being said, here is what I have so far,
  let me know what you think. I know it needs work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signature_5212.gif]"

  body: I think you may need a little vertical stroke before you curve in on that
    'r' and its bottom stroke is a little heavy. Otherwise this is fantastic.

  body: "I agree, the 'r' does need a little more work. I think I also need to work
    on the 'G' a bit. The loop in the top left doesn't seem to be aligned quite right
    where it crosses over. I'm going to work on it a bit tonight and try to get the
    first name done as well and I will post my revision. Thanks for the feedback Stephen,
    it is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?"

  body: 'I''d raise the top loop of G and not let the stroke get too thin there, so
    it looks solidly like part of the letter - I''m getting a bit of an ornamented
    "Fray" or "Jray" from this. '

  body: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind when I work on it tonight. The 'G' definitely
    has some issues. I'm also wondering if I should close up the opening in the 'a'
    slightly. Any thoughts?

  body: Maybe, but don't clean up too much. Part of its charm is in its irregularity.

  body: "Sorry for the delay, I do have an updated version here. The first name proved
    to be a little more difficult for me and I did touch up the last name a little
    bit. I still don't think it's quite there yet so I would really appreciate your
    feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signature2_5720.gif]"

  body: "First thing, the \"m\" seems particularly clumsy. And the \"a\"s are different.\r\n(and
    I still read \"James Fray\"."

  body: "I agree the 'm' stands out as being rough, I also think the 's' needs work.
    As far as the different 'a's go, I know they are a little different. My intention
    is not for this to be a typeface. I was thinking it would be better if they weren't
    exactly the same but does it just make it look off?\r\n\r\nAgain, I really appreciate
    the feedback. It's helping quite a bit. I will work on getting up a revision soon
    but if anyone has advice in the meantime, please chime in!"

  body: The lowercase letters of James seem too aligned and straight. Part of the
    charm of the last name was its credible rising and expanding x-height.

  body: I am reading Aray. I had to have a look into the dictionary. Array is written
    with two r. So people that better speak English have another expectation and therefore
    the risk of a misunderstanding of the letters is lower for them.
