body: 'I&#39;m in the early stages of redesigning the logo and general identity &#40;letterhead,
  business cards, potentially other pieces&#41; for a small law firm. <BR> <BR>They
  are trimming their name down to two of the founding partners, as they&#39;ve been
  calling themselves by that name for a while now anyway. They&#39;re a smaller firm
  that gives large firm service at a lower rate. They&#39;re also know for their friendliness
  and approachability. However, they are conservative and traditional in their look,
  which they&#39;d like to lean towards. <BR> <BR>Right now, I&#39;m in the early
  type-choice phase &#40;since they want a logotype, no mark&#41;. This is the final
  set I&#39;ve narrowed it down to. I plan to use the logotype, along with one or
  two &#39;classic&#39; design devices &#40;a rule, a solid box, etc.&#41;, to keep
  their collateral sharp and clean. What I&#39;m looking for at this stage is reactions
  to the type, either good or bad. I&#39;m gathering impressions to help me choose
  the 2 or 3 I&#39;ll work with. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts/impressions are greatly appreciated.

  Harris set 03"> <BR> <BR>One note: I&#39;m leaning away from the version with the
  rule in the middle. Another designer and I believe it makes their names look like
  an abstract brand, rather than two names, and encourages people to add an &#39;and&#39;
  in the middle. Also, any &#39;crud&#39; on the logos come from online type previewers,
  it&#39;s not in the design. <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

  body: Chris, you need to use the whole line. They will identify themselfs as Kraut
    Harris &#40;Titles&#41;. That might change the feel of the type. A thought might
    be names in all caps and &#40;titles&#41; in small caps.

  body: I think the line actually helps separate and define the two partner names.
    These names are not the most identifiable last names ever, and could easily misunderstood
    to be arbitrary brand names. A line element or something makes it feel like a
    lawfirm with partners, something that people are familiar with, without the and
    or ampersand, and I honestly don&#39;t think people would just place an and in
    there when reading it, particularly if that&#39;s now how they present themselves
    &#40;on phone, on conversation&#41;. <BR> <BR>With that said, I think whitman
    caps is a good looking direction.  <BR> <BR>Aaron

  body: So, after some quick meetings with the client, and some early mockups, they&#39;ve
    chosen a very conservative design &#40;which I&#39;ll post this weekend&#41;.
    They also prefer the Whitman Caps. Interestingly, it came out that they <i>want</i>
    the name to feel like an abstract brand, since the names in the logo are not the
    only partners. They liked the line a lot, but preferred the Whitman alone. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for the input Allesandro, Aaron and Dan.  I&#39;ll post some stuff
    this weekend. The development timeline is tight, so I may not be able to do another
    Typophile crit before it&#39;s due.

    The two-sided business cards got axed for a one-sided. It&#39;s good, though,
    to be reminded that they still chose some good type. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s all about
    perspective.

  body: Chris very nice and conservative. What would be cool is if you could get them
    to spring for a silver stamp for their name. That would insure a priority to the
    firm&#39;s name since the lawyers name is fairly large.

  body: They are a very centered-centric bunch. However, the example uses fake info&#42;
    that is a tad bit shorter than the actual info, which lessens that effect. Though,
    I&#39;ll give it a second look. <BR> <BR>&#42;Which I guess was kind of pointless,
    considering that the URL is on there...

  body: Chris, I&#39;m from the pre-computer generation. We cut out teeth on process
    as much as color and composition. A good example is you take a paper with a huge
    texture and heat stamp it, it becomes slick where you stamped it and if you put
    a pastel coating before heat stamping it added a tint of color. These processes
    are being forgotten with the computers. Sometimes the simple applications that
    a printer or engraver can add can radically change how a piece looks. Run that
    gold stamp by the client. You probably could get samples of gold stamping from
    paper companies or your printer.

  body: I have to play devil&#39;s advocate. While a nice silver/gold foil is nice,
    it seems too obvious for this market. What about a pantone metallic? Too boring?
    Plain? <BR> <BR>Chris, the logo seems to be too high on the card as well as--perhaps--too
    small in comparison to the rest of the information.  I&#39;ve done a scribble
    to illustrate what I&#39;m thinking.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/55663.jpg"

    I try to avoid fake gold, it usually looks tacky to my eyes. I like the silver

    your layout is that a few of the partners have really looong names, like &#34;Stephen

    idea &#40;rejected by the client&#41;, which I liked the most. I&#39;m curious
    what you all think of this design, which uses an older version of the logo: <BR>

    Perhaps center the logo on both sides and position the personal info at the top,

    require you to move or lose the light blue background. <BR> <BR>On another note:
