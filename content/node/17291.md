body: Reading my newsfeeds today I came across a fairly old piece of news. I wonder
  if others have <a href="http://www.oskarlin.com/images/chevron_01.png">seen this</a>.
  [Via <a href="http://www.oskarlin.com/">Oskarlin</a>] I am not a branding guru,
  but this seems entirely misguided.

    couldn''t get any company to know that they needed to rebrand, and now they''re
    doing it even if the don''t have to. I''m starting to think this is an economy
    thing. If we see the auto industry follow suit, I''ll bet that''s probably what''s
    happening. They''re probably thinking: rebrand=revenue recoup.'

    old logo wasn't really that awesome. It is just so iconic, because we've seen
    it forever.\r\n\r\nThey've picked this up ad 3D-fied it\u2026 it looks a little
    internet-y, but it could be way worse. At least it doesn't look like a simple
    photoshop filter, a la UPS.\r\n\r\nPlus, that old typeface wasn't really working,
    and seems dated.\r\n\r\nI know, I know. This new treatment looks dated, too. But
    I doubt it will last for decades. But the time it gets too dated, they'll replace
    it again. Probably before then even, at the rate things are going\u2026"

    no great fan of either logo, but the rebrand ticks all the right boxes that oskerlin
    notes. Despite your dislike of trademark rebrands of today (swooshes, gradients,
    cuddly aesthetics), it is certainly a contemporary corporate badge. As designers
    at the point where this bullshit is spun, it is all very transparent to us. No
    doubt this was consumer-tested to the hilt, and I'm sure regular folk (not us
    higher people) would have given it their thumbs up. I think it's a clever, but
    nonetheless frighteningly successful rebrand."

    everywhere, or rebrand = custom fonts that are really just data that has been
    stolen and renamed to avoid paying proper licensing fees.

  body: Ouch, it hurts to see good old logotypes getting killed like this! I've seen
    this "3D trend" coming on for some time now. It seems that designers today are
    just too fixed on what can be done on the screen. Even if the printed sector have
    decreased over they years, the logotype still have to befitted well for several
    different environment and solutions. Btw, I recently noticed that the VISA logo
    also has been remade... to the worse of course. I think it will hit back somehow?!

    be from the same type family. The _e_ is huge. The _v_ is tiny. The _C_ is falling.
    Don't even get me started on the ribbons.

    I wonder what the one-color versions will look like... Well, the other day I saw
    the side of a UPS box printed in just one color, and the new logo looked like
    <a href="http://paceschool.org/PaceWeb/upsLogo05.jpg">this</a>. Without all of
    the Photoshop shine, there's not much left in the swoosh that replaced the package
    which was part of the former logo.

    would say, \"But that doesn't have anything to do with computers!\"\r\nAll of
    this faux-3D rebranding makes me think that maybe it really is all about computers.
    It's depressing because it means we're that much closer to being replaced by monkies.
    Monkies who happen to be marginally trained in Photoshop, but monkies nonetheless.
    Maybe we lost some sort of vote and the computer kids won. So here's my personal
    rebrand slogan: graphic design = computers.\r\nThat type is pretty lame. Not just
    by itself, but in the context of being on every other street corner in North America.
    What are they afraid of? Why does it have to be so wimpy and non-descript? I mean,
    I know why it is (blasted focus groups!), but why does it HAVE to be?"

  body: "From what Oskar wrote, (in the post linked in the original post here), I'd
    say that Chevron went with the simplest, safest design change. They're clearly
    trying to soften their image and that visual link with ribbons is a single-move
    way to turn the militaristic echelons into softer friendly forms. They're succumbing
    to every new trendy logo rework technique, which is a shame, but they're actually
    sticking very close to their original image, which is rare.\r\n\r\nI've seen some
    other companies ignore their brand's heritage in ways I believe hurt their image.
    However, in this case, I think Chevron would've benefitted from a BP-style (Oh,
    I'm sorry. 'bp-style') redesign/rebrand. I think they should break more of the
    fetters to their old look if their old image is so problematic and static. BP
    did this very boldly and very successfully. They really do seem much more committed
    to the shift of 'oil company to energy company' than most (they <em>seem</em>
    much more committed). Though, I have yet to see Chevron's new campaign, which
    may help reinforce the message of change.\r\n\r\nI don't really like the type
    Chevron chose, as it's kind of a say-nothing face in today's context, but I have
    no doubt it's what they wanted. All-in-all I'd say it's a safe and logical move,
    even if it's not a stellar logo. I don't think the logo is really going to be
    their biggest issue in trying to alter their image in the minds of their customers,
    but that's partially their own fault. Again, bp did a great job of designing a
    flagship logo to spearhead their philosophical image shift."

    the last version the now defunct logo. \r\n\r\n<cite>\"My main objective, back
    in 1991-1992, when I was\r\nworking in SF, was to center the v in \"Chevron\"
    and\r\nI nearly accomplished it to my own satisfaction. It \r\nwas just a tad
    off, due to the fact that C has to be\r\nwider than r. In short, the h matches
    the width of\r\nthe n; and the e matches the width of the o. The\r\nbalancing
    act is definitely not a merit of the new \r\nincarnation. Its symmetry is rather
    poor, in fact.\"\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nIt is nice to here such effort being put into
    something. He was their signage consultant for a while as well.\r\n\r\nI can see
    that the new Chevron logo is softer, but if the goal was to move away from military-like
    ribbons, I think they didn't quite make it. Anyway, it is the type that disturbs
    me the most I think."
