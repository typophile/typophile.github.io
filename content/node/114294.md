body: "I thought I had seen most of the unusual characters associated with scientific
  publication in the 19th century but this one has got me stumped.  It occurs several
  times at the end of sentences published in an 1829 issue of the Philosophical Magazine,
  and, as I haven't seen it before I am wondering if it has any significance to the
  text, or if it is merely typographical decoration.  Could you tell me what the character
  is called and if it has any special meaning in its context. The attached image is
  a picture of the character as taken from the original printed material. The OCR
  program has interprted it as \"Tj\" in one place and as \"^\" in another, but I
  doubt this has any meaning, given that the program in use cannot reliably extract
  the letters ae from the character \xE6!\r\n\r\nhere is one excerpt from the text
  with my square brackets showing its positioning:\r\n\"oxypetalum. E. (Acute, red
  and white flowered) tubo longi-\r\n    4.   tudine loborum acuminatorum; floribus
  sessilibus,\r\n          fructibus longitudinaliter nervato-angulatis.\r\n              Cactus
  oxypetalus. DeCand. Prod. Syst.Veg. 3. 4:70.\r\n              Habitat in Mexico.
  \            [HERE].\"\r\n\r\nhere is another:\r\n\"Habitat in Mexico, ubi invenit
  Dom. Ackermann, et\r\nDomino Tate multis aliis communicavit : in cujus horto\r\nnunc
  copiose floret.              [HERE].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original text can be viewed
  at this link:\r\nhttp://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15533177\r\n\r\nI thank you
  in advance for any help you may be able to give,\r\n\r\nCiao, KK.\r\n"

  body: It's the symbol for Saturn. Would that make sense in the context?

  body: "And that's also the symbol for lead. But the context is about botany, where
    one might expect the symbols for Mars and Venus, standing for male and female
    flowers.\r\n\r\nSo my guess would be that the plants in question are hermaphroditic.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Looking it up, I found this:\r\n\r\n[[http://bytesizebio.net/2012/03/08/the-origin-of-gender-symbols-in-biology/]]\r\n\r\nso
    if Linnaeus is being followed, those are <em>woody</em> plants, not, as I had
    guessed, hermaphroditic ones."

  body: "Thank you, Thank you,Thank you, BOTH!  Yes \"woody\"  could well make sense
    in context.  I never thought of looking up Astrological signs - that is cool!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\n\r\nCiao, KK."
