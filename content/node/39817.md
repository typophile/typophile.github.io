  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. The huge serifs are very nice.\r\n\r\nI
    guess there is no corresponding font \u2013yet ;), must be some customized typeface.
    I'm intrested in fonts with let's say 'paralell verticals in the counters', in
    a more or less similar weight, any ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/o_5589.jpg]"

    fonts were ok, but quite bold, I'm looking for something similar to the \"port
    du jour\". PDJ is an entry to \"Les Halles\" in Paris by the way."
