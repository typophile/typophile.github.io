  body: "> <em>Promote better education in schools</em>\r\n\r\nI completely agree
    with tuning in students to font, type usage and certain issues regarding fidelity/quality
    and licensing in the same manner students are taught software programs.\r\n\r\nBy
    students, I used to think graphic design pre-grads, but now I think if there is
    anyway we could influence teachers as early as third-grade (about 8-9 years old
    when children first develop an understanding of ethics) would be a great influence
    as students mature. \r\n\r\nSince ALL users of computers and electronic communication
    devices are USERs and potential authors, designers, developers, etc., then there
    is no reason to narrow \"type sense\" to students of the visual arts. EVERY user
    uses type whether they are aware of it or not, and ANY user can decide to install
    fonts to the system, meaning they are in some way selective.\r\n\r\nPerhaps \"font
    selection\" should even become part of the Language programs (in USA we call it
    \"English class\") since all students will use computers to submit written assignments.\r\n\r\nThat
    is the main reason I am a strong proponent of expanding Typophile's <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/16\"><em>Typographic
    Education</em></a> topic area and hopefully a resurrected <em>Projects</em> area
    would at least centralize instructive material for visitors, educators and lurkers."

  body: "One of the things that can be done to promote excellence in typography is
    to let aspiring font designers learn by doing, which I believe I am entitled to
    say, as someone who produced somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 despicable freebie
    fonts. There are a lot of accomplished musicians who started out in pretty miserable
    garage bands, but they got to be where they are now by practice, practice, practice.
    Designing GOOD fonts is no different.\r\n\r\nYes, a lot of freebie fonts are utter
    crap; a lot of my early efforts were utter crap. They evolved into respectable
    semi-crap and, eventually -- with professional guidance and practice, practice,
    practice -- they evolved beyond crap (at least, that's my story). There are also
    a lot of freeware fonts that are quite good. So, the freeware vs. \"commercial\"
    argument doesn't wash.\r\n\r\nAs a former freeware fonter, I can also attest to
    the fact that there are a LOT of cheap bastards out there who will NEVER pay for
    a font, no matter how much they like it. There are even people out there who believe
    that, because you make freeware fonts, you are their presonal fontmaking slave:
    some of the requests that I have received in the past would boggle the mind with
    their brazen greed, sense of entitlement and utter cluelessness. So, let the jerks
    have their crap...they're not going to change their ways. And the pirates are
    going to keep on stealing until they get caught (and taken out into a back alley
    and have the snot beaten out of them)...that, unfortunately, is life.\r\n\r\nPromoting
    excellence in typography on a global scale is, most likely, a hopeless mission,
    if for no other reason than Thomas Aquinas' 700-year-old observation: <em>de gustibus
    non disputandum est</em>...that is, matters of taste cannot be argued or, in more
    modern terms, there's no accounting for people's taste. Within the circles of
    professional type designers and graphic designers, there are forums, exhibitions,
    etc., where what is regarded as excellence is recognized and rewarded, but it
    ain't gonna happen within the general populace, at least not until reality TV,
    hip-hop fashion and Regis Philbin disappear."

    global <em>awareness</em> of typefaces is a feasible endeavor. \r\n\r\nMy 4 year
    old granddaughter is starting to spell her name on the PC. Children are probably
    more attuned visually than their parents. Do you realize that by the time many
    children reach the first grade, they would have had a year or two of computer

    my earlier incarnation I promoted font sales by producing both marketing and educational
    material on type styles and type usage. Not all the purchasers of fonts had a
    real sense of typographic excellence, but they still wanted the fonts (the true
    meaning of font) because they were either <em>in style</em> or they were convinced
    that it would somehow improve their output.\r\n\r\nYou will have a much easier
    time selling fonts in the future if the general public became more aware of style
    differences. The general consumer market is already convinced that one brand of
    jeans or sneakers is actually <em>better</em> than another less expensive brand.\r\n\r\nI
    would eventually like to help improve the marketability and usage of fonts on
    both consumer and expert user markets, as that's what I did in the past for Agfa-Compugraphic."

  body: "A useful lesson for all type users (and many type designers) might come from
    the very name of this thread: We oppose font pirates, whether they offer pirated
    fonts for sale or giveaway. These days, plenty of pirates sell plenty of crappy
    fonts with impunity. To whom?...  \r\n\r\nWe approve of talented, honest designers
    who develop quality fonts and share them, whether by selling or giving them away.
    There are some very good free fonts out there. So it's not necessarily free vs.
    commercial. It is based in ethics and in quality. High-quality font houses might
    reasonably offer a free font in an effort to entice buyers. The freebie collectors
    will visit their sites, grab the freebies, and disappear, fixated on the next
    free item. But it seems sensible to consider free fonts as part of the market
    for fonts. Other marketing techniques we see all around are variations on \"free\"
    fonts: bundling with applications, bundling with printers, bundling with each
    other, adding value and providing incentive. \r\n\r\nIn all this, we still find
    that the general public is almost completely oblivious to the provenance of typefaces.
    Fonts are just on their computer, or downloaded from the web. They just apppear.
    Nobody \"works\" at making fonts, they just happen. So no wonder people would
    shell out full price for crappy ripoff fonts without having any idea what options
    they have in terms of quality. No wonder so many refuse to pay for something as
    well-crafted as Minion or Gotham. All fonts are the same. \r\n\r\nThat ignorance,
    obliviousness, is what we really oppose. The options in the market exist as they
    always have. But Norbert has an important point: All computer users are potentially
    active, not passive users of type now. That is radically new. So many new people
    dealing with type selection, size, weight, leading, letterspacing, not to mention
    common mistreatments of type like stretching and sloping, grunge-ifying, and other
    \"special effects\". All those people who might very well like to know more about
    type use..... As Norbert says, a more widespread awareness of type use and type
    manufacture would go a long way to helping the type industry in terms of perceived
    value. "

    to throw in that even age 6, when kids are really picking up reading and writing,
    can a good time to start making them aware of typography. They are so focused
    on individual letters and on trying to reproduce them that it can be a great age
    to plant the idea that type can be beautiful, and that people put a lot of effort
    into making it that way. \r\n\r\nI've watched my daughter try to perfect a certain
    kind of lowercase a, and have had her ask me why a letter can be the same letter
    but have a very different appearance.\r\n\r\nEven in my son's daycare, when the
    educator reads a story to the kids she points out who the author is and who the
    illustrator is, highlighting the idea that someone's creative work went into producing
    the book. Perhaps a similar kind of awareness (ok, perhaps not to 4 year olds)
    could be promoted for type. \r\n\r\nK.\r\n\r\nThat said, I just bought my first

    type design would really raise the awareness level amongst designers coming fresh
    out of university I'd think. A course where they would be led them through the
    process of designing both a text and a display face including an extended set
    of glyphs with proper ligatures, accents for multiple languages, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile
    some students would find this to be a very unique experience giving them more
    insight into an often overlooked aspect of design, I'm sure others would find
    it excruciating having to flesh out just the basic letters that make up an English
    alphabet.\r\n\r\nIn both cases having gone through the process of type design,
    they'd probably have a better appreciation for what goes into an expert set with
    proper metrics and extended glyphs and, ideally, more respect for those who dedicate
    their lives to creating type.\r\n\r\nMaybe most universities do offer such courses,

    body: "It  may be a bit premature to start teaching children about the ethics
      of an economic system they don't know exists.  They have to know the basics
      of buying and selling before they can really understand how that applies to
      intellectual property. That said, I agree with Norbert's suggestion that good
      type design should be part of the language program.  Many students in English
      classes (or whatever else) need to be instructed in the basics of good typography
      before they start using paper and ink on awful-looking reports. For example:\r\nIn
      my highschool composition class, there was one girl who turned in a paper hand-written
      with a yellow highlighter. The teacher told her it was illegible, and that the
      paper was supposed to be typed anyway. (I could get into the issue of poor penmanship,
      but that would probably make me sound older than I am). So she typed and printed
      the paper, set in Papyrus, and with the very same yellow.\r\nThis may not have
      anything to do with the problem of type piracy, but for the sake of promoting
      good design, there are other things to deal with first. Students need to know
      what makes a font appropriate for a particular use, and most don't care about
      anything beyond that. I dare say most will never buy a font in their entire
      lives. They'll stick with bundled fonts, and there's not much to do about that.\r\nI'd
      also like to add that as a college student, I wouldn't like being forced to
      take another class. It's one that I would likely take anyway if it were offered,
      but I'd like to have the choice. I'm not in a situation in which I can afford
      to buy fonts\u2014that's why I make my own\u2014and additional costs for classes
      aren't going to convince me to spend more.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm one of those cheap
      bastards who will never pay for a font (well, not for a while). Sorry."

    future) type specifiers (those who actively select typefaces for print or on-screen
    usage), is there a way to guide them towards font purchases that would improve
    sales for mid-to-small type foundries.\r\n\r\n2- Within the gerenal PC/Mac user
    base, is there a way to \"entice\" a percentage into occasional font purchases.\r\n\r\nSince
    this topic thread is mostly about loss of potential font sales (which is often
    the only means of revenue for type designers and font developers) due to \"freebies\"
    and pirated versions, the purpose of \"type education\" is to help improve font
    purchases. I hope most of you know that I am a true proponent of improving typographic
    awareness in graphic design professionals, but \"educating\" the consumer is another
    matter entirely.\r\n\r\nIf we could separate education for better type usage,
    and the marketing of fonts to a growing user base, we can begin to assess current
    situations and propose solutions for one or the other, or both. In terms of marketing,
    converting a small percentage of the user base could mean significant increases
    in font sales.\r\n\r\nThe problem would then be (as in all markets) who will get

    and paper companies.\r\n\r\nNo type foundry or distributor today places the same
    significance on producing printed samples, specimens, promotional literature,
    etc. as when type was mated with high-end typesetting equipment, hot or cold.\r\nAs
    a result, designers are no longer stimulated or inspired by seeing PRINTED examples
    of exquite or radical typography.\r\n\r\nThat's why \"old timers\" are so reluctant
    to discard any of the printed pieces they own... once it's gone there will never
    be another.\r\n\r\nOn-screen or PDF review of typefaces is quite another visual
    experience plus so readily available, making every sample \"commonplace.\"\r\n\r\nToday,
    only printing and paper companies continue producing exemplary printed works in
    order to market their product or service. Paper and printing costs today (and
    postage for direct mail) have become prohibitive for the budgets of most type
    foundries. But for printing and paper manufacturers it's their bread & butter.\r\n\r\nThere
    may be great merit in looking to the print and paper industries for continuance
    of exemplary samples of typography in print. I know this is an open forum, so
    in some ways I personally feel devising actual plans should not be for public
