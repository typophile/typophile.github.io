  follow Latin-1 and then let anything additional come in alphabetical order after
  the Latin-1 glyphs, but I have also seen some fonts that put all accented characters
  in alphabetical order."

    strategies that have arisen over the years (Unicode order, grouped by base shape
    similarity, etc.) to solve specific problems or work around technological roadblocks,
    but not one single way that works for every situation. \r\n\r\nIn the absence
    of any such force, you should devise something that makes sense to you and is
    easy to extend and maintain (i.e. if/when you add new glyphs or whatever)...maybe
    something that is easy to explain to others, should you need to have other people
    work on your data at some point in the future.\r\n"

  body: Thanks, Josh. So aside from sticking to a convention that users seem happy
    with, is there a reason to not order accented glyphs in exact alphabetic order
    as opposed to some of the other schemes?

  body: "alphabetic order according to PostScript names? I think that's a bit silly
    as these may seem canonical to a typeface designer they're really only arbitrary
    and this sorting would not necessarily be logical to anyone else.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    going to do your own sorting scheme, you may as well group accented glyphs by
    visual similarity or by most frequently used or some combination of the two."

  body: "I vastly prefer \"unicode order.\" If you sort by alphabetical order, when
    you spool through the characters in the metrics window for kerning, you get, for
    example, all the a's, then all the b's, etc. I've too many years with a workflow
    where the sequence goes a-b-c-d etc. Kerning the accented & other letters comes
    later. For the unencoded characters, I set the index (order) by hand; I like the
    numbers to run from 0 through 9, and the proportionals not be scattered with the
    tabular. Etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, bear in mind that the sort order will affect what
    the next character will be in the metrics window.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: 'James, a warning also regarding fiddling with the glyphs order: I ended up
    with two or three different glyph orders inside the same family, by stumbling
    through the learning process. The fonts worked OK in all the software, only the
    MyFonts character renderer just would not show them right. Re-encoding, generating
    Unicode and Names did not fix the problem. In the end, the solution was to sort
    them all in <em>Index</em> view by Unicode, then re-encode on FreeFont.'

    capability to automatically generate pair lists of a variety of specifications--cap
    to lower case, lc to quotes, cap to diacritics, etc., etc.--that you can scroll
    through in test strings (prebuilt or user specified) for kerning.    '

    of <em>some</em> reason :-)\r\n\r\nSeriously though: with a few technology-based
    exceptions, glyph order should be mostly transparent to any users. Some things
    I've seen and used over the years that have forced a particular ordering are:\r\n-
    need to keep the font size as small as possible: ordering in Unicode order helps
    keep the 'cmap' subtables small\r\n- complex OpenType Layout functionality: ordering
    by similarity of base forms helps to find things when looking through the glyphs
    (I think Calibri is or at least was arranged this way, for the most part)\r\n-
    avoiding backwards-compatibility issues: adding new glyphs to the end of the existing
    order helps when comparing old <> new\r\n- many glyphs (50000+) with very extensive
    GSUB lookups, needed to place certain glyphs at a certain place within the order
    to avoid overflows of certain variables.\r\n\r\nOthers have suggested other reasons,
    though I'm a bit puzzled by the MyFonts thing...I suspect something else had gone
    awry there.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Can't guarantee anything as I don't really know the inner workings of MyFonts
    nor what might cause fonts not to work there, but if you can get the fonts to
    me somehow (I think you can get in touch with me via my forum contact form) I
    can poke around and see if there's anything obvious. If possible I'd like to see
    before and after versions.
