body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Typophile</strong>\r\n\r\nStrictly
  speaking, a fanatic of all things [[type]]-related or [[typography|typographic]].
  In a broader sense, a lover of letters. This looser definition encompasses writing
  and lettering as areas of interest. See also [[typophilism]].\r\n\r\n<strong>[[Indices]]
  : [[Organizations]] : Typophile</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com\">Typophile</a>
  launched 16 April 2000. Typophile originally launched with exclusive articles and
  online courses from [[Jonathan Hoefler]] based on his [[Yale]] lectures as well
  as articles from [[Three Island Press]] and [[TypeRight]].\r\n\r\nTypophile's stated
  aim is to further [[typography]] as a craft as well as a profession by providing
  an open, collaborative environment where users can contribute and access content
  for free. In the Typophile Forums members discuss everything from how to pronounce
  [[Edward Benguiat|Benguiat]] to writing [[Pangram|pangrams]] or just getting help
  identifying a [[typeface]].\r\n\r\nAspiring and professional [[type designers]]
  post their work for peer critique. Currently there are over 500 fonts by designers
  from all over the world where English is commonly spoken -- North America, South
  America, Europe and Russia.\r\n\r\nTypophile is produced, designed and maintained
  by [[Punchcut]] (<a href=\"http://www.punchcut.com\">www.punchcut.com</a>), a San
  Francisco based interface design company. Typophile members, film fest sponsors
  and advertisers provide the sustaining financial support to keep Typophile thriving.\r\n\r\nTYPOPHILE
  FILM FEST\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Typophile started the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/filmfest/\">Typophile
  Film Fest</a> with the debut showing held at [[TypeCon]] 2004 in San Francisco.
  It has since been shown in New York, Boston, Seattle, St Petersburg and Vancouver.\r\n\r\nTypophile
  has been featured in <em>[[Tupigraphia]], [[Metropolis]], [[Applied Arts Magazine]],
  [[STEP]]</em> and <em>[[How]]</em>.\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\n\r\n<strong>Typophile</strong>\r\n170
