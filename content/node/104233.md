  body: "In the 1940s there was very limited choice of fonts, no digital, not even
    any phototypesetting, and much was done by hand lettering rather than a font.
    We can locate fonts to match everything in your image except Home Owners, which
    is a script on a non-geometric arc. I checked my collection of pre-1950s typescripts
    and while some are close, none match precisely. I suggest Home Owners is probably
    no nonsense lettering created by the Sears art department.\r\nPossibly Linotype
    machines were used as part of the production of the 1940s Sears catalogs -- if
    any one has any info please speak up -- which would suggest the fonts are from
    Linotype.  For the sans fonts, there might be something closer but its worth checking
    the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/\">Trade Gothic</a>
    fonts as  digitized by Linotype. I can't discern the details of the serif font.
    It could be any of several including <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/centennial-2/\">Centennial</a>
    as digitized by Linotype.\r\nHope your friend succeeds with the pro bono book.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Home Owners: I said none of the pre-1950s typescripts in my collection were
    close matches. If you want this style for more than these words, then you should
    consider adapting an existing font, even if it was produced more recently. Some
    things to look for in such a font are fairly low contrast stokes that are not
    to heavy, angular, and no flourishes.  Not really that close but might do in a
    pinch,  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontdiner/lamplighter-script-marquee/\">Lamplighter
