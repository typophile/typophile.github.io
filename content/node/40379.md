  and it will include a considerable amount of CSS and HTML code examples. What are
  some good typefaces to set this text in?\r\nThe basic requirements here are that
  it be monospaced and readable. \r\nI noticed that some popular choices are Monaco
  and Andale Mono. What other alternatives are there?"

  body: "Andale Mono is excellent. Here a few others that I highly recommend: <a href=\"http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">DejaVu
    Sans Mono</a> (which is an improved version of  <a href=\"http://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/dev_fonts/vera.html\">Bitstream
    Vera Sans Mono</a>), <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/pr/pr2007_11_12.html\">Droid
    Sans Mono</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/msfonts/consolas.html\">Consolas</a>.\r\n\r\n(I
    am a coder who spends many hours a day staring at code, both on screen and in
    print, so I have strong opinions about which fonts are good.)"

    books with more horrid typography and lack of proofreading than Wrox.

  body: "Thank you for your suggestions! I will look them through. \r\n@aluminum:
    I am pretty sure Wrox doesn't have a local branch in Romania :) And indeed, their
    books can sometimes look rather uninspiring.\r\n\r\nI am trying to do most of
    the work by myself, including typesetting and illustration, partly because I enjoy
    doing it, and partly because it's an opportunity for me to develop some new skills.\r\n\r\nAfter
    searching the web for additional information, I found this [[http://typographica.org/000744.php|thread]]
    over at Typographica. Lots of great information!\r\n\r\nI'm also considering TheSans
    Mono by Luc(as) de Groot. Seems a pretty nice typeface. "

    there's a very respected example of code extracts <em>not</em> set monospaced.\r\n&ensp;If
    you've your heart set on monospaced fonts though, Raph Levien's [[http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html|Inconsolata]]
    ([[http://www.typophile.com/node/16444|Typophile thread]]) might also be worth
    a look.\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: I like using [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/LuxiMono/ | Luxi Mono]],
    since I'm particular to serif faces. As far as I know, this is easily the best
    (free) serifed mono. Lightyears from Courier.
