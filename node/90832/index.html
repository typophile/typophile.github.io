  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We are working on a Jan van Krimpen Cancelleresca Bastarda Revival, together with Rodrigo Fuenzalida. And we are doing it 'In the open', posting all the betas as we make progress, and encouraging public participation and feedback.

I started this back in November 2011, and then put it to sleep because of the lack of high quality sources.

But something awesome happened:
A very generous and humble Benedictine monk, that have the original metal cut, printed a specimen just for us and sent a high-quality scan. And we like to share it with the world.

Now the project is back to life! We are currently on Beta21.
And, as usual, it will be released under the SIL Open font license.

There is a little system in place, for easy sharing of comments and source files.
Here you will find the latest betas and source files (and the high-res scanned specimen):
http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/jan-van-krimpen-cancelleresca-bastarda-revival

We will like to invite everyone to check it out, and participate! 
You can make any edit to the sources you see fit, and post it back in the project comments.

		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jens, thanks! 

Those and the Kris's flickr photo were the best we could get. 
We will love to have access to even better sources, like photos of the metal punches or original drawings, but sadly we don't so we have to guess a lot of the details.

It's not just me. Rodrigo is also doing a lot of work.
He does the first round during the day and I iterate and refine during the night, and we chat over Skpye to discuss ideas.

I'm also studying "Three Classic of Italian Calligraphy" by Oscar Ogg (facsimile reproductions of Arrighi, Tagliente and Palatino), and "Penmanship of the XVI, XVII & XVIIIth centuries" witch can be read online here: http://www.archive.org/stream/penmanshipofxvix00dayluoft#page/n7/mode/2up

Also, playing and writing with a variety of nib pens to try to get a better sense of the flow and the contrast.

We sincerely hope that this can be good revival, and we are putting all our effort to make it as good as possible. But we can't do it alone, we need all the help and feedback from everyone. That's the only way we can improve it.

We also have the previous digital CB revival by Richard Beatty, called Romus (the entire romus family) but it's not of any help, because it lacks all the details we are trying to include in our version, and it's also pretty different from the specimens. In fact, one of the reasons for doing this new revival, was that I was not happy with the one from Richard.

We still have a lot to improve (the spacing in particular) but we are making progress every day.

If you have enough sample settings you can reverse-
engineer the original spacing. However the process
William describes seems too iterative; I'd use math,
and start with an "nn" you might hopefully find.

But that's assuming you like the original's spacing...
A revival can be faithful in various flavors; since CR
was a metal type, adhering to the original spacing can
potentially be seen as a bit <em>too</em> faithful. You might study
JFP's revival of Sabon (they once produced a highly
revealing booklet about it) to see ways of figuring out
what compromises were originally made and why, in
order to decide what original decisions to over-ride.

		<div class="commentbody">It is so delicate that I don't dare to smash it on the scanner, so only scanned this one page at the momment. Enjoy! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/88-foto01-original_6279.jpg]


Also purchased "Ten Simple Rules for the Spiritual Life" [img:sites/default/files/old-images/89-foto01-original_5390.jpg]
Believe me, the scanner does not do justice to the beauty of these books. Not even to the brightness and texture of the paper (that can be better appreciated in the first photo on the previous post).

Both were masterfully printed at the Stanbrook Abbey Press.
I'm very happy to see how this beauty was used in real life (Instead of simple specimens). Now we can also study how the spacing works, and keep improving the revival.
