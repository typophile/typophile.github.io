body: I'm looking for a site similar to 5inch.com that features blank media & cases
  in various solid colours. I've found several wholesale sites, but not the one I'm
  looking for. Does anyone have any idea what site I'm looking for?

  body: Like <strong>[[http://www.jewelboxing.com/|Jewelboxing]]</strong>? Not exactly
    blank media cases in colors, but definitely nice, premium cases and all the necessary
    inside bits to make 'em look pretty.

  body: "If I remember correctly they did have jewel boxes as well as digipaks. I'm
    not sure if those (the jewel boxes) were coloured as well, but if not then they
    definitely had coloured inlays. Some of the colours I'm sure they had are yellow,
    orange, red, blue, lime green, black & white (probably also pink & purple). The
    digipaks also came in plain cardboard.\r\nI know I haven't given much to go on,
    but that's pretty much all I can remember about the site (which is also why I'm
    having so much troubles finding it)."

  body: "Found it!!!\r\nApparantly my mind played a few tricks on me seeing as they
    only do digipaks (for CD's & DVD's)... My bad!\r\nI can definitely recommand everyone
    to go take a look at http://www.blankpak.com/english/index.html\r\nYou gotta love
    the colours!!!"
