    similar a few days ago on a diagram in the Paris subway, where Jean-Fran\xE7ois
    Porchez's Parisine had given way to something that looked also like Myriad."

  body: This would be a major violation of the LT graphic identity standards. If this
    has been done system-wide (and not just a temporary line change, which would also
    still be unacceptable...or a prank by a technologically accomplished yet typographically
    challenged individual) then the LT style guide has been chucked and one of the
    oldest and most consistent graphic identity standard systems has been destroyed.
    This is not hyperbole. My feeling is that it is not authorized.
