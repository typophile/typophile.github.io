    the TeX typesetting system (or more popularly its extension LaTeX). TeX/LaTeX
    is immensely popular for typesetting mathematics and indeed the glyphs here are
    designed for typesetting mathematics. I don't think you'd be able to find a Greek
    text version with these glyphs.\r\n\r\nAndrew"
