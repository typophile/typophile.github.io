  body: "The original logo was designed by French illustrator Turenne Chevallereau,
    c. 1940:\r\nhttp://www.maximidimini.com/history-of-longchamp/\r\nhttp://www.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/longchamp/447
    [French]\r\nhttp://en.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/longchamp-1/538 [English]\r\n\r\nBased
    on the following poster, also by Chevallereau, the original logotype appears to
    have been based on Nobel (designed in the late 1920s by Sjoerd de Roos):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Nobel_rdrct.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/longchamp_pipes_advertisement_6078.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhile
    some details of the type (N, M) were preserved, over the years it seems the letter
    forms were refined to introduce more thick/thin contrast and to condense the width.
    \r\n\r\nI'm classing this a custom design, though Ocean Sans has the right contrast
    and few other details that make it an excellent starting point for a recreation."
