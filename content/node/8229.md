body: 'Anyone know what determines the stacking order of a family&#39;s fonts in the
  style menu of InDesign&#39;s Character pallette?  <BR> <BR>It seems to have little
  or nothing to do with font naming as I have a family with normal, caps and expert
  styles in semilight, regular &#40;w/ bold&#41;, &amp; semibold weights, yet these
  groups are listed in a odd order in InDesign. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s my list in the
  style menu: <BR> <BR>Caps <BR>Expert <BR>Regular <BR>Semilight <BR>Semilight Caps
  <BR>Semilight Expert <BR>Caps Italic <BR>Expert Italic <BR>Italic <BR>Semilight
  Caps Italic <BR>Semilight Expert Italic <BR>Semilight Italic <BR>Semibold <BR>Semibold
  Caps <BR>Semibold Expert <BR>Semibold Caps Italic <BR>Semibold Expert Italic <BR>Semibold
  Italic <BR>Bold <BR>Caps Bold <BR>Expert Bold <BR>Bold Italic <BR>Caps Bold Italic
  <BR>Expert Bold Italic <BR> <BR>Any thoughts/ideas on how to get these into a more
  organized order &#40;ie: all regular weights together, all semilights together,
  all semibolds together - other than, of course, splitting them into separate font
  families&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for any advice...'

  body: Sorry, I should probably also mention that this is an OpenType family. This
    is part of an ongoing attempt to convert a &#40;PC&#41; PS T1 family to OT so
    that I can use it on both my PC and Mac &#40;I started another thread on this
    conversion process <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/55911.html?1103308075">here</a>&#41;,
    but this query is specific to stacking order of styles. <BR> <BR>Again, any help
    would be greatly appreciated...

  body: I believe they are listed according to the weight class in the OS/2 table,
    which suggests that some of your fonts may have incorrect or ambiguous settings.
    It looks like the semibold and bold are falling where they should, but the regular
    and semilight are not.

  body: Hi John, <BR> <BR>Thanks for your input. That does seem to have been the issue;
    in the &#34;Basic set of font names&#34; screen in FontLab I had the appropriate
    Weight set in text, but had left the numerical field blank. Once I set the appropriate
    numerical value, re-generated the fonts and transferred them to my other computer,
    the list came up in the correct &#40;by-weight&#41; order in InDesign&#39;s style
    menu. <BR> <BR>Now the problem is that the computer I did the work on won&#39;t
    recognize the change &#40;thus the order is still incorrect&#41;. I&#39;ve uninstalled
    the fonts, deleted them from Suitecase, made sure there are no shortcuts to the
    fonts in my C:\WINDOWS\Fonts folder, rebooted, even changed the name of the folder
    the fonts are in, but InDesign won&#39;t let go of its cached memory of the font
    settings. Do you know how to wipe the cache so that InDesign will see the fonts
    again as if for the first time? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help...

    copies &#40;the system may not let you delete some copies, but don&#39;t worry
    about that&#41;.

  body: 'Thanks again John, <BR> <BR>That did the trick; I&#39;d forgotten about those
    font lists &#40;the filename was actually still in my search list: adobefnt&#42;.lst&#41;.
    Once I got rid of those the fonts loaded up just fine. I think I&#39;ve finally
    nailed this conversion process &#40;although now that I&#39;ve said that in print
    something else will pop up&#41;. <BR> <BR>During the search I also found the following
    files: <BR> <BR>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\TypeSpt\FntNames.db <BR>&#40;400K&#41;
    <BR> <BR>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\TypeSpt\AdobeFnt.db <BR>&#40;5&#43;MB&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Do you know what these are, if they&#39;re necessary, etc? <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again for your help...'
