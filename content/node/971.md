body: 'indesign users: y&#39;all remember how easy it was to make global changes to
  kern pairs in qxp -- i&#39;ve spoken w adobe reps &amp; they assure me that indesign
  will NOT have this feature in any future revs. this means that altering kern pairs
  has to be done at the font level, thus: <BR>1. leave indesign app <BR>2. turn off
  font in suitcase or other font manager <BR>3. open font in font editor <BR>4. make
  change&#40;s&#41; to font&#39;s kern pairs <BR>5. turn font back on in font manager
  <BR>6. return to indesign &amp; get back to work. <BR> <BR>am i missing something?
  can anyone offer a better method? this seems way too time-consuming and troublesome.
  <BR>HELP! <BR> <BR>thanks much, folks.'

    to worry about kern pairs... sounds foolish,  <BR>but that seems to be their direction.

  body: It&#39;s not so foolish. Spacing is a 99% technical thing &#40;at least for
    text&#41;, so a really smart algorithm could do it fine. In fact, the current
    one in InDesign does better than 90% of type designers. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Optical kerning has worked pretty well for me thus far with body text. Headlines
    sometimes require manual tweaking...but nothing major. I&#39;m not sure I would
    screw around with a font&#39;s metrics to correct something that could be fixed
    in InDesign.

    said, &#34;sounds foolish to me.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Spacing is a 99% technical

    fine. In fact, the  <BR>current one in InDesign does better than 90% of type  <BR>designers.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>and I suppose this smart algorithm could rely on the  <BR>same advanced
    measures that helped you arrive at  <BR>your percentages? ;&#41; really though,
    I&#39;m sure there is  <BR>some magical formulaic way to decode great kerning
    --  <BR>but who has the formula? don&#39;t you think typographers  <BR>are still
    going to want a global override for some letter  <BR>combinations? if Adobe wants
    to steal Quark&#39;s  <BR>customers, maybe they should consider these  <BR>customers&#39;
    requests. <BR> <BR>I really should hold judgement until I am able to work  <BR>further
    with ID &#40;I&#39;m still stuck with QXP here in the  <BR>office&#41;. the optical
    kerning functions that I have seen  <BR>are tremendous, and it really looks like
    a promising  <BR>development. at the same time, I think we need to  <BR>remember
    that there is a great deal of subjectivity to  <BR>this profession and incorporate
    that into our  <BR>applications.

    InDesign should get that feature.&#34; <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>i specifically cornered
    the adobe indesign rep recently and badgered him about this. he told me in no
    uncertain terms that this would POSITIVELY DEFINITELY NOT be forthcoming in ANY
    indesign releases, which is why i started this thread in the first place. <BR>
    <BR>so ... NO ONE has any ideas? i know that i&#39;m drawing a blank. <BR>&#42;ugh&#42;'

    <BR> <BR>sorry, I tend to drift off into discussions about the  <BR>question rather
    than delivering answers to it. I should  <BR>have said in my first post that I
    have no clue how to  <BR>work around this gaping hole, outside of the  <BR>unpleasant
    method you&#39;ve already described. hopefully,  <BR>if we badger them enough,
    Adobe will correct this  <BR>mistaken decision and nab one more advantage away  <BR>from
    Quark &#40;of which it now has very few&#41;.'

  body: maybe it could be done by a plug-in? <BR>perhaps someone could contact any  <BR>plug-in-programmer.
    <BR> <BR>I think, it would be a useful feature - not  <BR>necessarily for normal
    Text, optical kerning is  <BR>very good, but for logo-fonts or special  <BR>characters/pi-combinations.
    <BR>In a 500-page-book created with Corel Ventura I  <BR>used it for better kerning
    of numbers.  <BR>In InDesign it would be necessary to use optical  <BR>kerning
    for all the text to improve inline  <BR>numbers. <BR> <BR>

  body: Actually, this is a feature that is on the InDesign team&#39;s radar for consideration
    in future versions of the application. I can&#39;t comment on specific features
    of unannounced products, and I&#39;m not saying it will be in the next major version,
    but to say that &#34;it will positively definitely not be forthcoming in any InDesign
    releases&#34; is vastly overstating the case. If it doesn&#39;t make it into the
    next major version, it will definitely be in consideration for the following one.
