body: "I am looking to redesign the masthead for our magazine and would really appreciate
  any suggestions you might have.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome added information for you...\r\n-Currently
  we are using a branded font for the mast.\r\n\r\n-The publication is a 16 page monthly.\r\nLink
  to current issue:\r\nhttp://www.1mcd.usmc.mil/MAG%20ISSUES/magazine%20archives/Archive05-06/MAG%20ISSUE.htm\r\n\r\n-Primary
  audience is Marine recruiters assigned to the northeast US.\r\n\r\n-Secondary audience
  is the Marine's family members (magazines sent to USMC recruiting offices and homes
  of the Marines)\r\n\r\n-Additional audience is the applicant who happens to pick
  up the magazine in the recruiter's office.\r\n\r\n-Magazine staff: 1 (Editor) with
  support from a graphic artist part-time.\r\n\r\n-The Commander is shifting his creative
  focus. The logo for our unit was the typical Marine-bulldog (which was cartoonish).
  We are moving toward a wolf's head design, supported by the quote \u201CFor the
  strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack\u201D
  by Kipling.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/200704 Cover Small_6132.jpg]"

    scrolling. 590 pixels wide should do it. Thanks!\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "What a great photo. The only problem I have with the type is the W. I think
    it is weak, I doubt that the font has an alternate but I would rather see the
    interior diagonals reach the top line! And the W A R is not well kerned. You also
    might want to consider the ST being smaller with an underline.\r\n\r\nLooking
    good!\r\n\r\nMichael"
