body: "Hello all, \r\n\r\nSo I was asked to make a logo for a local dive and surf
  shop. He wanted a dolphin jumping over the Earth. \r\n\r\nSo I came up with something
  I thought looked clean and refreshed from their old logo, which literally was 3
  pieces of clip art put together. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou all have great insight and good
  comments, and this isn't something I would normally show here, but I just would
  like a critique or some insight as to make this the best with what I was given.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DolphinEarth_4877.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DiveDolphin_4358.jpg]"

  body: "Wow. Tough brief.\r\n\r\nI think you did wonders considering what you were
    given. My only comment is that the detail on Earth is very different from that
    on the dolphin. I'd 'roughen' the land mass a little bit. Make it more abstract.
    In my opinion, all elements of a logo need to look like they were drawn with the
    same pen.\r\n\r\nIs the red proposal mandatory? I'd keep it blue."

  body: "Thanks TypoJunkie, \r\n\r\nI understand what you are saying about the 'same
    pen' making the logo. \r\n\r\nThe red they want to put on a certain dive sticker.
    But the primary shop logo will be blue."

    oceans and landmasses are. It looks like your dolphin has a wizard's beard.\r\n\r\n

  body: But I liked it. The earth looks good as for me. And the whole logo does too.
    But, of course, only blue color and noooo read for any solutions

  body: "That looks cool I think, quite fresh and original!\r\n\r\nA few quick things:\r\n1)
    Given that that dolphin has no eye, if the earth is also red he looks quite dead
    to me. :-\\\r\n2) Have you tried h-flipping the dolphin so that he moves/jumps
    left-to-right? (Possible stronger forward movement)\r\n3) Regarding the brief:
    To my reading this dolphin is not necessarily \xABjumping over\xBB the globe,
    he's sort of lying/swimming on top of it. Dunno if that's a problem though.\r\nI
    also agree with what was said about the detail level in the globe. "

    part looking as if it crushing the other after it has dropped from a great height.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said i does look ok. I would second the idea of correlating the dolphin marks
    with the earth details.\r\n\r\nAlso is a red version essential? I get a hellish
    fire and brimstone feel from it!"

  body: 'I understand why you need a red version of the logo since it is mimicking
    the standard dive flag. So yes it is essential. Most divers are familiar with
    this color combination. I think you need more detail in the dolphin such as an
    eye. '

  body: "Thanks all, I appreciate the feedback. I am currently working on correcting
    the Earth, to redefine the strokes. \r\n\r\nTheQMovement is right, the red is
    essential, but only in minimal applications. Plus the shop owner loves it, i did
    have my qualms about even showing him, but I went with what the client would want,
    not me. \r\n\r\nNever noticed the similarity to the firefox, but I think it is
    different enough, plus the owner also asked me to knock-off some Pepsi something
    or other, I said we'll see. \r\n\r\nI know the beard image is in there.. but i
    love that.. It takes a minute of staring, but i think its funny. \r\n\r\nSo im
    going to push more on the globe, updates soon."

    about abstract geography? Like in the Firefox logo. \r\nOr do you need to communicate
    the actual geographical location?"
