  of for-sale and free sites for this, since it seemed to have some characteristics
  of free fonts. It was on some art work (outlined for once) sent to us by our client
  and their designer has recently moved on or we could just ask him. I'd just pick
  a new font if they weren't already sold on this one. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6664.jpg]"
