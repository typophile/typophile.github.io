body: "I thought I'd share something we've been working on for months now.\r\n\r\nIt
  is a web font-embedding system which is based on W3C standards and provides a secure,
  reliable way to use fonts whose files are hosted on a global network of servers.
  When you buy a font license you will be able to create embeddable fonts. Simply
  enter the URL(s) where the font will be used and the languages to be supported,
  and the system instantly generates a short block of CSS code. Paste the code into
  your website, and you are ready to start using the font. You will not work with
  actual font files, but with the CSS code linking to the font files. For most browsers
  TTF subsets are used, for Internet Explorer, fonts are converted to EOT format on
  the fly.\r\n\r\nPart of the project was to define which glyphs all of our 100 supported
  languages exactly use. Say, I use our Fedra Sans Pro, with over 2,000 glyphs, which
  is over 500k. When you choose to use English only, it will remove all the Greek,
  Cyrillic and Extended Latin, OpenType features (besides the ones that are currently
  supported by browsers) and make a font that is only 30k. Users can define as many
  languages they want, but of course the size of the font inflates with every additional
  language.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample:\r\n[[http://www.typotheque.com/webfonts/multilingual_sample]]\r\n\r\nKnown
  issues: In Safari, Arabic will work. Opera 10 and Firefox 3.5 require AAT fonts
  for word shaping on Mac OSX. In Windows, all scripts should work fine (Latin, Greek,
  Cyrillic, Arabic).\r\n\r\nMore information about the system is here\r\n[[http://www.typotheque.com/news/web_font_service_preview]]\r\nWe
  plan to launch the service this summer.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/"
