  body: Hey Eben, have you seen the new pixel image editor called <a href="http://opensword.org/Pixen/">Pixen</a>?
    It's a cool editor for things like this. It's still not very advanced yet, but
    you said you used to do pixel-based work, yes?

    out how to make something that small.  I use Goudy Stout's V as a favicon on my
    site.  Maybe I can use that.  Might be hard to fit Van Lieu Photography dot com
    on that size. :-)\r\n\r\nSharon"

    old school editor just because I know it really well if I was doing this stuff
    again. Pixen might have an edge on the old school stuff in that it supports transparency.
    Nice link Dan!\r\n\r\nSuggestion:  you might want to tighten up that space between
    the Y & L\r\n\r\nDan, you are coming to Typecon right? "

  body: "pearlstreet:\r\n\r\nAnti-Pixel badges are easy to make. It's 80x15 pixels,
    and people typically use the silkscreen typeface that it freely available online.
    As noted by Eben above, if you're not careful, the font's kerning will be ugly,
    but it is free after all.\r\n\r\nEben:\r\nI really like Pixen. I just wish that
    you could use type. There's no support for glyphs, or even rudimentary type. A
    shame. It's open source, so maybe we nudge someone like Raph to help them out
    with that :)"

    type to use? Perhaps the  <a href=\"http://typography.com/resources/index.html\">Hoefler

    having the 1st  letters a touch darker would punch it up?

  body: "Dan, thanks! The colors for that are copy/pasted from my home page's source
    code The pallet of blues and one off white was all built around wanting to use
    cyan prominently. I kind of think of it as a designer's color, both from CMYK
    printing and back-in-tha-day playing with Commodores, where it was this funny
    (ugly?) compromise color I dithered into others. For the site, I decided to feature
    it in a \"pure\" fashion. That badge is an attempt to imitate it, though I had
    to darken the background and add that shadow so it would read.\r\n\r\nEben, to
    look at the differences, I zoomed the images to 200%. The kerning is actually
    looser from the O onwards, and it looks like the word stretches out as it reads.
    At 100% it is harder to see. Is that intentional, or a side effect? I will go
    back now and loosen up around the I but leave the rest at 1px space...\r\n\r\n(correction:
    were all at 2px originally, appears that you also modified the 't'?)"
