body: "[[http://scriptsource.org|ScriptSource]] is a dynamic, collaborative reference
  to the writing systems of the world, with detailed information on scripts, characters,
  languages - and the remaining needs for supporting them in the computing realm.
  The first release was in June 2011, but we've added many significant improvements
  since then. Here are some of the most recent enhancements:\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<em>Topics</em>
  - You can now add information to ScriptSource that is not associated with a particular
  script, character or language - but rather with a topic related to computing and
  writing systems, such as keyboarding or font development.\r\n\r\n<em>Comments &
  Conversations</em> - You can now comment on any entry, source or need, and in real-time!
  This allows for ongoing conversations in response to a particular topic or contribution.\r\n\r\n<em>Discussions</em>
  - Questions are now welcome! You can start a discussion on any script, character,
  language or topic, and others can provide answers through the new comment and conversation
  features.\r\n\r\n<em>More Scripts</em> - We're up to 237 scripts now, and have reorganized
  our list of scripts to make browsing easier. The 131 scripts known to be in current
  use are at the top of the page. We've also increased our links with the important
  Script Encoding Initiative.\r\n\r\n<em>Enhanced Data</em> - This includes CLDR version
  2.0, IPA and Phonetic Symbol Guide information, and updated versions of other resources.\r\n\r\n<em>New
  Home Page</em> - It's even easier to find interesting and useful information on
  ScriptSource, and add your own contributions. You can also see stats of what ScriptSource
  contains, and a list of the most recent contributions. The Featured entries will
  be changing each week, so check back often to explore new scripts and topics.\r\n\r\n<em>Cleaner
  Code</em> - Finally, our HTML and CSS are significantly improved and should be even
  more robust on a variety of devices.\r\n\r\nIn the next few weeks we also plan to
  add:\r\n\r\n<em>Blogs</em> - ScriptSource will be hosting a few blogs related to
  the site and complex script computing, so we now support a more blog-style presentation
  of entries on a topic. These will begin to appear soon, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\n<em>Feeds</em>
  - You'll be able to subscribe to RSS feeds based upon your particular interests.\r\n\r\nWe're
  clearly excited about these new features, so we hope you'll [[http://scriptsource.org|try
  them out]]. If you haven't been to the site for a while, please take a look at what
  we've done and give us feedback on how we can make the site work even better.\r\n\r\nThanks
  to all of you who have helped us refine and improve ScriptSource in recent months,
  and to all who have spread the word about the site at various conferences and through
  blogs and forum posts. We appreciate your partnership and participation!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nVictor,
  for the ScriptSource Team"
