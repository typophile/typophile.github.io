body: "I don't know what to look for in a printer - and a search didn't show any results
  (how can that be?), so I'll ask here. A printer I've been recommended is Samsung
  CLP-310N, but I have no idea if this is a good printer.\r\n\r\nI want a printer
  that gives good results with printing text, but also good enough results with printing
  some graphics/photos.\r\n\r\nI'm gratful of any recommendations and help on this
  topic."

  body: It was a toss-up for me between Brother and Epson. I finally ended up with
    one of the new, sleek black Epson Colorio models. The Mac drivers seem solid,
    and having six inks lets you print photos more nicely. The advantage with Brother
    printers was (IIRC) their special ink that doesn't make the paper soggy, and handling
    of larger paper sizes.

    original InD file.

    <strong><a href=\"http://www.druckerchannel.de>Druckerchannel</a></strong> in
    that thread. HP printers have a tendency to print too thin. My Samsung prints
    relatively close to the outline, but it looks a bit too thin. And the a printed
    with almost all HP monochrome printers looks much thinner. Just compare the photos
    taken with a microscope from the printed Palatino letter a with the original outline.
    I would not buy one of the HP printers, that were tested on Druckerchannel. Samsung
    or Brother. Maybe Lexmark, because of the resistance of the toner against mechanical
    influences like folding the paper."

    the Samsung CLP-310N prints text too fat \u2013 in total contradiction to the
    Samsung monochrome printers. And this matches with what a acquaintance of mine
    has said about that Samsung. I really think, that these pictures taken with a
    microscope, are meaningful. And I doubt, that you can get a good color laser printer
    for the price of the Samsung CLP-310N. Printing text and pictures in high quality
    is actually impossible in that league."
