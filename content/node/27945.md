  topic:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/27913\r\n\r\n... I\u2019d like to come up
  with something more elaborated. ;-)\r\n\r\nI created a semi-capital font in almost
  the same type of grid, slightly more complex now.\r\nThe result are some written-like,
  quite decorative lettershapes.\r\n\r\nI really like the fluidity of some of the
  shapes, where others tend to be stuck in the grid and bear strength when standing
  on their own.\r\n\r\nI have attached a file with the font on it, including my work
  method.\r\n\r\nBelow you can see a sample. Any comments, ideas, advice?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Examples_6558.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Disclaimer: those are just my views, so don't be offended. I'm often wrong,
    but here's what I think.\r\n\r\nI think the shapes are nice, but as a typeface
    it's almost impossible to read. This is almost always a disadvantage. How do you
    envision the font being used? Body text, signage, logos, on-screen? None of these
    are really feasible due to the low readability. Is there any way you could make
    it easier to decipher? Also, it's almost impossible to kern it the way it is.\r\n\r\nAnybody
    else think the letters resemble faces with various moustaches/beards? Sort of
    like stylized Beatles portraits (the \"H\" is definitely Ringo). And the strict
    \"grid\" (if that's the term) reminds me of LCD displays.\r\n\r\nAs a thought
    experiment or conceptual art project, oh yes. As a usable font, not really."

    body: "Termopolium: thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nActually, I think you're
      right. The font is not meant to be legible in the first place. My first concern
      was how to create lettershapes within the borders of the grid, I faced a very
      theoretical design problem. So to say, there were many restrictions, so many
      that they could be (appear to be) an obstacle if it comes to legibility and
      practical usability.\r\n\r\nI think this font, in its current form, can be used
      in short word images, maybe logos, only if the word itself is very easy to recognize.
      Some shapes are more distinctive than others, during design process I noticed
      that some words written in it worked, where others failed to do so.\r\n\r\nI
      think it is a matter of making the right combinations."

  body: "There's already a font called Quicksilver... not sure if you'll run into
    copyright issues.\r\n\r\nAs for the font itself, I agree with Stefan for the most
    part.\r\n\r\nYour 'F' and 'P' are too similar (I read both as 'F'), as are 'U'
    and 'O'. 'B', 'D', 'H', 'T', and 'Y' seem to be the least legible letters. If
    you work on these, it may increase the readability of your typeface. 'S', and
    'R' could use work, although they will probably be readable in context with other
    letters.\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nP.S. your image says \"JIGSAW PVZZLE\" not \"JIGSAW
    PUZZLE\""
