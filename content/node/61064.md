  could be mistaken (wouldn't be the first time, to be sure) that the letters surrounding
  the cloverleaf are a modified Bank Gothic, but if anyone wants to correct me, I
  certainly wouldn't take offense. What I need to know is in which font \"THE TRACTION
  CO\" is set (if indeed it is a font; the O's look different upon closer investigation).\r\n\r\nAny
  and all help is greatly appreciated!"

    are dramatically different, and the <strong>T</strong>s, while similar, aren't
    identical.\r\nIn the course of creating an entire alphabet, a designer catches
    and corrects gross inconsistencies like:\r\n<li>Huge, heavily bracketed serifs
    on <strong>E</strong> and <strong>T</strong>, and practically no serifs on anything
    else.</li>\r\n<li>Diagonal stress on <strong>A</strong> and (sort of) <strong>N</strong>,
    and vertical stress on everything else.</li>\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be unusual for
    a logo to be hand-drawn if it was done around the same time the railroad was founded
    (1905, according to their web site). \r\nMorris Fuller Benton designed Bank Gothic
    in 1930, so it's probably not the inspiration for the initials at the corners. "

    Os just as I posted it, and can now see that the C in CO is not a mere horizontal
    stretch of the C in TRACTION.\r\n\r\nOh well. Time to fire up Illustrator. Thanks
    for shedding some light on this!"
