  body: The only thing I can find in the FontBook is Agfa&#39;s &#39;Brazilia&#39;
    and it looks too wide. It has a similar a, c &amp; k, but the stem on the h is
    not quite so short &#40;i.e. the x-height is lower than your sample&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Of course, you said this is from the &#39;80&#39;s, when more type was film
    or metal. This may not be easy..

    &#40;Baker Sans and Gerstner Program&#41; but I think it was probably custom drawn.
