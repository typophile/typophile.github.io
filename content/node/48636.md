body: "I have been asked to compile some film\r\ntitles and a poster for a strange
  but beautiful film.\r\nI can't even begin to explain the plot!\r\nSee attached stills
  for a flavor.\r\n\r\nThe piece is called 'Wintering' I liked the idea of a strong\r\ntypeface
  that would work well on screen as when you move\r\ntypefaces on screen they fill
  in a blur any small details.\r\nI enjoyed the Assignation of Jesse James' which
  used the attached\r\nface (I don't know what this is) \r\n\r\nBut I was thinking
  a swash on the W could look nice.\r\nbut I'm open to suggestions from you guys\r\nwhat
  do you think....\r\nI'm on the side of Univers at the moment or Aachen (is that
  how you spell it?)\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts ...\r\nx\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jesse_6124.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wintering_5941.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Wintering2_6256.jpg]"
