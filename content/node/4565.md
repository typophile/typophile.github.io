body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;I have loved Type since I can
  remember and I&#39;m now in the process of building a web site purely dedicated
  to type especialy type in design, its not a font site its a site about type used
  as graphic art and its use in film, Web, and print. I have my main body finished
  and I&#39;m now looking for contributors to the site one their experience or use
  of type as graphic. <BR> <BR>I have a preview feature that will feature past and
  present type by designers, and would gladly showcase any work featuring type if
  it is used as par of the desing body. <BR>I will link this site to my site, even
  if this post is deleted. <BR>I apologise if this post is inapropriate but please
  note that my site is not commercial I have spent alot of time building it and It
  is only out of passion. <BR> <BR>Please email me at info@pageopen.com <BR> <BR>Tony&#60;/font&#62;'
