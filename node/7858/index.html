<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am 21 years old and next may i will be graduating having completed a graphic design hnd. <br> <br>We have an end of year show at 'the workstation' Sheffield, where Designers Republic are based. <br> <br>The reason i am posting is to ask advice. . . <br> <br>Even though a few design consultancies and agencies come along to the end of year final show which is highly recognisable for being a good standard, i have been thinking about something else. <br> <br>I am quite a good designer, i dont mean to be modest but i may have a junior design job secured for next january, have had my work exhibited in a gallery in London, and a few designers say the overall quality is good. <br> <br>Putting that aside should i send out a promotional pack to design agencies throughout the UK, fairly near Sheffield, to invite people to come visit me and hopefully with my portfolio i might secure some interest. <br> <br>I am just trying to take some initiative, what does everyone think?</div>

<div class=commentbody>It was not for that purpose. <br> <br>Basically i call it a sagmeister rip off because it is what he did, but! <br> <br>I personally did it because i feel i can express my personality in a much more profound way then sticking 'alex haigh creative design' in helvetica neue on a business card, i dont think there is any design in minimalism when it comies to business cards as the worlds full of them. <br> <br>My representation was to suggest i am extremely passionate about what the industry i am hoping to enter, the fact that design is skin deep for me and it is not just 'a job', i wanted to give it a meterphoric meaning show my future employees how i try to express design not just aesthetically but with ideas to. <br> <br>As for secure job, it isnt 'secure' as i go on a trial week, if i get offered a job by a better agency or better pay or personal circumstances for me then i will take it, i am trying to make myself as employable and 'wanting' as possible. <br> <br>Yes i fully understand no CD or SD will have the time, so thats why i want to create something that could possibly open doors for me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi <br> <br>Over the past ten years I have had quite a bit of experience of this, from trying to find a job, to interviewing for my own agency. <br> <br>I found that the best route was to call up and ask if people could spare 15 minutes to look at my work. I never asked for a job, just for advice. <br> <br>Next, when I went to visit an agency I would ask if they could recommend any other good places to approach. Sometimes they would call up and make an appointment with friends at other agencies for me. <br> <br>My business partner loves it when people send a letter thanking her for seeing them. She gave a job to someone for that reason once. <br> <br>From your point of view, you should be asking for placements. Try and line up a whole string of them, most people will pay you something. This puts you top of the list if a job does become available. <br> <br>From the hiring point of view, I like to see good work. But a lot of people have good work. I want someone who wants to learn more... so I would never say that you think you are good. <br> <br>I personally think that most graduates don't try to find work, they might mail out a cv, or a CD-ROM, but if they really want a job they have to put in more work. The only way to find work is to get sat down with your folio in front of someone. If you get a placement, just make yourself really useful, not only in terms of design, but by offering to cut stuff out, buy coffee, anything which makes you look like you'll work your &#149;&#149;&#149; off. <br> <br>Good Luck <br> <br>Jim <br>=== <br> <br><a href=http://www.sumodesign.co.uk target=_blank>http://www.sumodesign.co.uk</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>To get one over on your competition try and learn more about print production, for example, always a sticking point for graduates. <br>Instead of rip off, refer to it as a homage, though whether a potential employer will think 'passionate' or 'stalker' is another matter. <br>"the fact that design is skin deep for me and it is not just 'a job'" <br>The saying is more than skin deep, meaning it goes deeper. Check your invitation carefully or better still get someone to look at it critically; your presentation could be let down by bad grammar or spelling. <br> <br>Still, best of luck <br>Tim</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dear Alex, we have the same name, a name that has been <br>spreaded by Greek who gave the name the meaning of <br>'defender/protector/guardian' of their own folk/people <br>from: 'alexein' = 'to defend' & 'aner, andros' = 'man.' <br>But write also your family name on your card. I'll queue <br>those who would like to see your visit card design. <br> <br>'design not just aesthetically but with ideas to' <br>The soul is often in the surface, and the importance <br>of 'depth' is overestimated. Or like Picasso said: <br>'Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain <br>an artist once he grows up.' <br> <br>'create something that could possibly open doors for me' <br>Key words & symbols which turn matter into spirit. <br> <br>Like Mr. Jim Richardson said, caffein help fo' sure. <br>I read somewhere that if you yell for 8 years, 7 months <br>and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy <br>to heat one cup of coffee. <br> <br>Recently I found out this forum, <a href=http://www.chinwag.com target=_blank>www.chinwag.com</a>, do <br>you know ? I also suggest to check out a good map like: <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53292.jpg target=_blank>www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53292.jpg</a> <br> <br>Toodle Pip, <br> <br>AS <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>The Boy With The Moon And Star On His Head <br> <br>Written By: Cat Stevens <br> <br>A gardener's daughter stopped me on my way, on <br>the day I was to wed. It is you who I wish to <br>share my body with, she said. We'll find a dry <br>place under the sky with a flower for a bed And <br>for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and <br>star on his head. Her silver hair flowed in the <br>air laying waves across the sun Her hands were <br>like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds <br>on. We left the road and headed up to the top of <br>the Whisper Wood And we walked 'till we came to <br>where the holy magnolia stood. And there we laid <br>cool in the shade singing songs and making love... <br>With the naked earth beneath us and the <br>universe above. The time was late my wedding <br>wouldn't wait I was sad but I had to go, So <br>while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for <br>cheerio. The wedding took place and people came <br>from many miles around There was plenty <br>merriment, cider and wine abound But out of all <br>that I recall I remembered the girl I met 'Cause <br>she had given me something that my hear could not <br>forget. A year had passed and everything was just <br>as it was a year before... As if was a year <br>before... Until the gift that someone left, a <br>basket by my door. And in there lay the fairest <br>little baby crying to be fed, I got down on my <br>knees and kissed the moon and star on his head. <br>As years went by the boy grew high and the <br>village looked on in awe They'd never seen <br>anything like the boy with the moon and star <br>before. And people would ride from far and wide <br>just to seek the word he spread I'll tell you <br>everything I've learned, and love is all... <br>he said. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/octet-stream><br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/CS_theboy-54468.unk target=_blank><b>CS_theboy.mp3</b></a> (96.8 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>
