  are. at first i was certain the type was Underground,  but it doesn't quite match
  the sample in myfonts. perhaps a more original version? i was also curious if anyone
  would venture a guess on date. i'm fairly confident it's from the 30s, but if anyone
  had more specific info, i would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nthanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Underground_6329.jpg]"

  body: i thought of that, but with no obvious variation in letter forms, it seemed
    unlikely to me. why go to the trouble of hand-lettering if you're not going to
    make it look hand-lettered? but i don't doubt that you're right.

    is fairly similar, except for the W; [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/register-sans-btn/|Register
    Sans]] has the W, but the M is not right; and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/regulator/|Regulator]]
    has a Geometric Deco feel, but the vertices are pointed.\r\n\r\nI also looked
    at House's [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=615|Neutraface]]
    family, but they also have pointed vertices, and other features further from the
    poster lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I've got loads of postcards of these London Underground posters. I can scan
    some if you want more examples. Most in this style are actaully from the 1920s
    but this could be '30s especially as London Zoo's fantastic art-deco penguin pool
    was opened in '34.\r\n\r\nYes, it is hand lettering but based on Edward Johnston's
    Underground typeface. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_(typeface)|wikipedia
    info]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=p22+underground|P22
    do various weights.]]\r\nThey'd need a bit of tweaking to look more like this
    particular poster. The crossed W is an alternate in them. The M in that poster
    is slightly flared, more like Futura."

    as c paine, but you actually found the poster and date. earlier than i expected
    -- 1921.\r\ni wonder what this original poster is valued at.\r\n\r\nanyway, let

  body: "The scans of the postcards didn't work too well so I've trimmed them down
    to just the lettering. (Any advice on how to scan colour printing like this without
    it ending up all dotty is appreciated)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kew1_5432.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kew2_4150.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kew3_4049.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    third one is unusual for using a theatrical poster style rather than a Johnston-esque
    sans. I'm pretty sure the Underground logo would have been carefully hand painted
    rather than be a collaged bit of printing or photograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd since
    it has a nice bit if deco sans serif on it, this is the famous 1930's Penguin
    Pool at London Zoo which made me think the penguin poster would have been from
    the same time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PENGUIN_POOL1_5062.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PENGUIN_POOL2_6445.jpg]"

  body: "justin-\r\ni can definitely help with your scanning question.\r\n\r\nwhen
    you are selecting your scan settings, almost every scanner will allow you to choose
    one of these options that will get rid of (or at least greatly reduce) the 'dotty'
    moire patterns.\r\n\r\ngenereally, it will be under \"original source\" in which
    case you want to choose 'printed material' but your scanner's option may also
    be a check box that says \"descreen\" or perhaps \"despeckle\" or even \"dust
    and scratches removal.\" any of these options will help reduce the moire.\r\n\r\nfor
