body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI would like to announce here a new major release of my
  Old Standard font family. The current version is 2.0.2, it has many improvements
  and new features in comparison with 1.0. In particular a bold version is now available
  in addition to regular and italic. I have also greatly extended the range of supported
  Cyrillic characters and implemented all Early Cyrillic letters and signs currently
  available in Unicode, including those recently added in Unicode 5.1.\r\n\r\nAt the
  same time I have posted three completely new fonts, which form together a single
  package, called Theano:\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n\r\n<dt>Theano Didot</dt> <dd>A classicist
  face, with both its Roman and Greek parts implemented in Didot style. Unlike Old
  Standard, this font is designed from French sources.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Theano Modern</dt>
  <dd>A font with Greek letters designed in the Porsonic style. Unlike most modern
  implementation, it is based on Figgins Pica No. 3 / Small Pica No. 2 -- probably
  the most successful and once the most popular Greek face of a Porsonic origin --
  rather than on later\r\nMonotype's design. The accompanying Latin font is implemented
  in the Modern style and modelled after English Modern faces of later 19th century,
  often used alonglide with Porsonic Greek types.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Theano Old Style</dt>
  <dd>A modernized \"Old Style\" Greek font with a large number of historic ligatures
  and alternate forms, modelled after some early 19th century types designed by Figgins'
  type foundry. It is accompanied by a Latin face based on some \"Old Style\" Roman
  fonts of the late 19th and early 20th century.</dd>\r\n\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nThese fonts
  were first intended as Greek only, but finally I found it interesting to supplement
  them with stylistically compatible Latin letters. For this reason Theano fonts currently
  have just one \r\nstyle/weight per family and contain only Latin and Greek characters
  (no Cyrillic).\r\n\r\nAll fonts are available for free (under the terms of SIL Open
  Font License). See http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html for more information
  and download links."
