  body: Yes, I&#39;d seen that before &#40;although I recently misindentified it as
    NBC36 on Typographi.ca&#41;, probably in an issue of Visible Language, but I&#39;m
    not sure. I have a photocopy of the article somewhere in my &#34;type closet&#34;...
    Those little dots are basically very crude traps. But apparently they worked well
    at a certain size, on 70s TV &#40;blurrier than today&#39;s TV&#41;. Anyway, it&#39;s
    nice to have an on-line reference. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Oops. Meant to post this to Typo-L, but it went to Hugo&#39;s mail... <BR>
    <BR>Wow, never seen this before. Looks like they took a slightly <BR>condensed
    Helvetica and subjected it to some primitive <BR>form of ink/light trapping with
    the same trap shape used <BR>on any problem area, no matter the angle. Odd. Looks
    like <BR>they ran out of steam and forgot to finish the ampersand.

    &#40;&amp;&#41;, as well as potentially <BR>on the ear of the lc &#34;g&#34;.

  body: Stephen, yes. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>If you trap the ear of the &#34;g&#34;
    &#40;which can be seen as minimally above 90 degrees&#41;, then some others open
    up, like in the UC &#34;Q&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: yeah, I think it&#39;s very interesting too. <BR>  <BR>I&#39;ve received that
    a while ago from a friend  <BR>while I was collecting information about  <BR>tv/video
    specific type design projects. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve sent the original &#42;huge&#42;
    file &#40;about 500kb&#41;  <BR>so you could dig on it a little more. <BR> <BR><a
    href="http://www.designaz.com.br/type/cbsbig.jpg">http://www.designaz.com.br/type/cbsbig.jpg</a>
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also upload another page I&#39;ve got,  <BR>comparing News Gothic
    Bold with CBS&#39;s font. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.designaz.com.br/type/cbsbig2.jpg">http://www.designaz.com.br/type/cbsbig2.jpg</a>
    <BR> <BR>Anyway, I couldn&#39;t find ANYTHING about it on  <BR>the net... If Hrant
    is right &#40;Visible Language&#41;,  <BR>that&#39;d be the most precise information
    I&#39;ve  <BR>found so far. <BR> <BR>hC
