body: "Hello everybody\r\n\r\nI am new to this forum and need some help with one of
  my clients who would like to me to design a book and some art prints for him. \r\n\r\nThe
  brief is to find: \"one of those classic 1930's Dutch sans serif faces that can
  be related to Piet Zwart's work. \r\nIt does not need to be Dutch \u2014 but should
  convey a sober, direct quality with the friendly but mildly Calvinist overtones
  of Dutch modernism.\" \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on that??\r\n\r\nSo
  far I presented him DTL Nobel, Akzidenz Grotesk, Gill Sans, Grotesk MT. I am aware
  that they don't 100 % match the brief, but couldn't really find anything closer...
  \r\n\r\nI'd be very grateful for some further suggestions!\r\n\r\nThanks heaps!\r\n\r\n"
