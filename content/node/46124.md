  body: "wow it's great to see that again. thanks for posting it.\r\n\r\nit's an early
    memory for me - one of my first moments of (some sort of) recognition of \"graphic
    design\".\r\n\r\ni was just a kid and it was my older brother's album. i was way
    more into the poster than the music."
