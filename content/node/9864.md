body: Hello All, <BR> <BR>I was just hired to redesign some forms for a healthcare
  group. Is there anywhere on the web I can look for some well-designed paper forms
  &#40;they need not be healthcare related&#41;. I need some fresh inspiration or
  else these forms will turn out to be little more than new revisions of their dull
  predecesors. Also, if you&#39;d like to throw some form-design advice my way, it
  will find its way between my ears. Cheers!

  body: My advice would be to fill out your own form. I&#39;ve seen way to many forms
    designed but clearly not actually USED by the designer to see if they could even
    be filled out. ;o&#41;

  body: I&#39;d agree with Darrel. A good first step would be to take the forms which
    they currently use and fill them out to see where they fall short. After all,
    the information is the same, isn&#39;t it? Aside from that, I&#39;m sure if you
    google for design &#43; health care you&#39;ve got to come up with something.

  body: Well, I can&#39;t give you any specifics, but I&#39;ve always been attracted
    to forms that take into account visual entry and information grouping. This also
    creates opportunities to go beyond type and rules. <BR> <BR>Visual entry, how
    the person sees the form within the first second or two and sorts the visual data
    into information about how to use the form, is something that often gets overlooked.
    What&#39;s the at-a-glance impression? Then, start examining each bit individually
    and ask yourself what&#39;s really needed. Also, use a clear, open, and high-legibility
    font so you can use smaller type without fear. I agree with Darrel as well. <BR>
    <BR>And semi-related, check out <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/005675.php">Airbag&#39;s
    redesign of an intellgence brief</a> to see how strong, simple, and <i>purposeful</i>
    visual hierarchy can inject a lot into a document that doesn&#39;t have much to
    begin with.

  body: Darrell, I&#39;ve already filled out the form, in fact my clients did as well
    but this was a great idea. Obviously great minds think alike. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> After doing that, we were able to make some choices about
    what can be eliminated and what should be added and better ways to organize the
    form. Chris, that&#39;s exactly the sort of thing I need. Fresh ideas on how to
    appproach data that has to be presented. I like the simple, but obviously well-designed
    form in the link. Do you have any more links like that? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'James, not only do forms need to work in the collection of data, but they
    also need to work in the extraction and entry of the data into some kind of database
    &#40;presumabaly&#41; or other persistent record. <BR> <BR>So part of your considerations
    should also be the workflow of the clerical task: what order does the software
    require the information in? Is the interface something that requires mouse clicks
    or is tabbing/shift-tabbing possible? Is the software changeable by you or a developer
    to improve this work? And if it&#39;s not going into a database in a computer
    perhaps the record book or file could benefit from your typographical design expertise
    as well. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Jon,  <BR> <BR>The forms I&#39;m designing are paper forms used to note patient
    data such as performance on an exercise stress test in order to aid a doctor in
    a diagnosis. When they&#39;re filled out, they will be added to the patient&#39;s
    chart. Unfortunately or &#40;fortunately&#41;, most doctor&#39;s office haven&#39;t
    switched to digital charts yet. However, your suggestions are nonetheless good
    ones and will be taken into consideration. Thank you.  <BR> <BR>Fonts will be
    an important consideration so that the technician, or the patient or whoever is
    using the forms fills them out reliably and quickly. Also if the chart is copied
    or faxed, the type needs to remain legible even if the reproduction isn&#39;t
    pefect. Currently I&#39;m considering Officina, which was designed precisely for
    this task, but I think I may ultimately go another font because Officina Sans
    reminds me too much of the 1990s. Any suggestions are, of course, welcome.
