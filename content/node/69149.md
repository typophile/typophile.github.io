  but as well this complex and diverse world known as typography. I don''t mean to
  waste anyone''s time in here and hope there isn''t a similar topic, but I would
  like a little help getting pointed in the right direction. I''ve found quite a few
  really nice type-related sites/blogs but I''m really interested in finding a few
  in-depth books that can give me a good basis of the "ins and outs" of type design.
  Thanks for your time! '

    a look at the [[http://typophile.com/wiki/Triumvirate|\"Triumvirate\"]].\r\n\r\nAs
    for the web, [[http://www.typedaily.com|Type Daily]] is a good place to start.\r\n[[http://ilovetypography.com|I
