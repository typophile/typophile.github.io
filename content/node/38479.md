  fonts, but doesn't actually have any clue what specifically makes a font ADA Compliant.
  I did a Google search and found little to no useful information so I was hoping
  some of you might have some experience with this. Does anyone know what the ADA
  Guidelines RE: Fonts are?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I work in the museum exhibit design industry. Accordingly, I work with ADA
    guidelines often. ADA is vague regarding specific fonts. Its more about size,
    placement and contrast. Essentially, use common sense. Consider the needs of your
    audience. Avoid decorative fonts and generally be a responsible, helpful graphic
    designer. If the project is related to type in an environment, the Smithsonian
    has developed a more comprehensive set of guidelines. They would be ADA compliant.

  body: "There are a few folks on Typophile who have a bit more experience than I,
    so I'm sure they'll add or correct as needed:\r\nAlthough the ADA is vague about
    specific fonts, there are a couple of things to check when picking a font. See
    this part of the spec:\r\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/reg3a.html#Anchor-10133\r\n\r\nThe
    font should be \"sans serif or simple serif type\", and as far as proportions:\r\n\"Letters
    and numbers on signs shall have a width-to-height ratio between 3:5 and 1:1 and
    a stroke-width-to-height ratio between 1:5 and 1:10.\"\r\n\r\nWhat falls into
    \"sans serif or simple serif type\" is not spelled out, but the proporitons should
    give you an idea. The basic idea is to steer you away from fonts that are too
    thin or too thick.\r\n\r\nJason C"
