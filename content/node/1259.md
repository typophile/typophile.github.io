  body: ' I normally stay away from the pixel fonts as I hardly ever have anything
    positive to say. This however, is very, very nice. It looks like it has potential
    as a real vector font too. Excellent &#34;g&#34;. Perhaps the &#34;Q&#34; could
    do with a more distinctive tail. Is this standard leading or has it been increased
    for the demo? It looks like you could lead a little closer. '

  body: 'thanx Martin <BR> <BR>I understand the feelings about the &#34;Q&#34; so
    I tried some other ones but I didn&#39;t came up with any nicer ones, which would
    fit the rest of the capitals. I&#39;ll try some more later. <BR>You were right
    about the leading, I tend to overdo it. This time a little less. <BR> <BR>I made
    some small changes: the horizontal bar in the &#34;f&#34; moved one pixel up.
    <BR>And the &#34;f&#34;,&#34;l&#34; and &#34;t&#34; have a pixel less white to
    their rights. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1614.gif"

  body: ok I finished the bold version so here it is. <BR>I think it&#39;s primary
    use should be in titles etc. Not for large bodies of text. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1621.gif"
    ALT="bingos.gif"> <BR> <BR>I ofcourse apologize for the strange text. When you
    finaly manage to think of a text containing all the letters. It turns out to be
    a rather strange one.
