body: The Asian Art Museum in San Francisco is publishing a major catalogue of classic
  Thai art from the former kingdom of Ayutthaya, to be called The Kingdom of Siam.
  The desire is for the catalogue to reflect the style of earlier Western writings
  from around 1700 &#40;in other words, around the time of the Romain du roi and early
  Franco-Dutch typography&#41;. A sample page of one of the models is provided. <BR>
  <BR>The typeface must also accommodate Thai diacritics, which have a couple of peculiarities,
  notably a backwards cedilla that has to combine with a macron, and a breve-like
  finishing stroke to some of the glyphs, which also must combine with a macron. I
  will upload funky approximations of these from a poor-quality source. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  prepared to create the special characters if I have to, but I would prefer to find
  an existing typeface that meets the project needs. To further complicate things,
  all of my work is postscript but some people need to work with the diacritics on
  non-postscript Windows machines. Maybe open type is a way around this? <BR> <BR>Any
  suggestions much appreciated.

    is not written with Latin characters. Modern Thai fonts are quite unrelated to
    this accented Latin stuff. <BR> <BR>The &#34;backwards cedilla&#34; is an ogonek,
    byt the way. The little thing sprouting off the u is a horn. Offhand, I don&#39;t
    know of any typefaces that would include these sorts of characters with the macrons
    as well, as precomposed characters. <BR> <BR>I could get into the technical stuff
    in more depth, but the short version is that if you want to use a font in more
    places than Word 2003 for Windows, you&#39;ll probably need specially encoded
    fonts &#40;non-Unicode&#41;. I don&#39;t know that such fonts with the characters

  body: 'Thanks for teaching me the word <i>ogonek.</i> I will be sure to use it soon!
    <BR> <BR>Of course Thai has its own script but it also has a romanization system,
    which uses the special marks I described among others. We mainly need these to
    render titles in the bibliography, where I guess they are critical. We are using
    the system approved by the Library of Congress and the American Library Association
    and published in a document imaginatively titled ALA-LC Romanization Tables. Following
    up on Hrant&#39;s suggestion I looked on-line for this and found it here: <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/thai.pdf"

    <BR>I agree about the sample. I considered Adobe Garamond and may still go with
    it, since we already own that font, but was afraid it wouldn&#39;t read as having
    the archaic quality that is being looked for. Also, this is only one of several
    model texts, and others are more RdR or Dutch in flavor than this one is. <BR>
    <BR>Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if we could afford to commission a special face!
    I doubt that would be within our budget, however &#40;not having any real idea

    since I started having an interest in typography &#40;was it typography?&#41;
    when I was looking/learing how to make my thesis, report, and slide presentation
    look more interesting. I got bored with Knuth&#39;s Computer modern, Times with
    MathTimes, and Lucida with LucidaNewMaths on a standard TeX system. There are
    not many choices there for mathematical oriented typography: Adobe just ditched
    a mac support for FrameMaker; hopefully, InDesign will have a built-in functionality
    to typeset mathematics and long documents to the level of previous FrameMaker.
    <BR> <BR>For the font -- I don&#39;t have any training in type design at all --
    the first line looks nice; it probably is a bold/black weight of a text face.
    <BR>The eyes of &amp;#3648;, &amp;#3604;, look optically imbalance, not sure why
    though. <BR> <BR>In the second line, I have seen this type of   typeface used
    often in a magazine. Some letters are quite far from the way we write though:
    &amp;#3619; that looks like s; and &amp;#3600; that looks like &amp;#3592; with
    a horn. <BR> <BR>The main text looks pretty normal to me. IIRC, it looks similar
    to one that Microsoft includes in their OS. <BR> <BR>I notice some spacing problems

    without hacking into the algorithm of the text setting software though. <BR> <BR>Regards,

    By Thai that is.  <BR> <BR>&#62;What do you think about the fonts in this sample?  <BR>
    <BR>[disclaimer: these comments are distilled through my Thai friends. I only
    wish they were wholly mine.] <BR> <BR>Line 1: standard newspaper headline that
    wants the reader to think it&#39;s more important than it is. Because of both
    the weight off the letters and the heads &#40;loops&#41;. I.e. it&#39;s &#39;classical&#39;
    Thai. Much like I make fun of faces like Trajan, my Thai friends make fun of things
    like this. <BR> <BR>Line 2: standard advertising, preferable to some readers than
    Line 2. Too romanized &#40;e.g., 5th consonant, <i>ro rua</i>, is too much like
    an &#39;s&#39;.&#41;. A lot of Thai I know think the heads make reading harder
    and prefer faces as in Line 2. Even for running copy at small sizes. <BR> <BR>Lines
    3-4: The Latin is too heavy. Arabic numerals are too heavy and too tall. I wouldn&#39;t
    be surpised if that was Browallia &#40;an MS font as Chanop says&#41;. I&#39;m
    no expert, but I think that the left sidebearing on <i>sara e</i> is too tight
    &#40;7th &#39;base&#39; glyph in the first word on the second line; 4th glyph
    in the last word&#41;. While it might look like the left bearings on <i>sara o</i>
    and <i>sar ai</i> are too big, that&#39;s what I usually see. And what usually
    seems to be accepted. <BR> <BR>Although, as I mentioned, all the head &#40;loops&#41;
    that make a face &#39;look Thai&#39;, they seem to hinder efficient reading. It&#39;s

    <BR>&#34;Too big on the body&#34; I don&#39;t quite understand the term, but I
    think it is. Let&#39;s say we have a typical Latin face at 1000 emsq design size
    &#40;Type 1&#41;; Caps hight is ~700, x-height ~450, and the length from the highest
    point to the lowest point &#40;ascender-descender&#41; is within 1000. To match
    this face with Thai alphabet that has a regular height between Caps and x height,
    let&#39;s assume it to be 550-600. That is fine until we look at some characters
    like <i>sara o, sara i, sara u, tonal marks,</i> and etc. When we combine the
    total design size from the top to the bottom, it goes well beyond 1000, quite
    ofen 1300-1500. <BR> <BR>Is there any real specification for this issue? Thomas?
    I have looked into Adobe Type 1 spec book, but found no concrete answer. <BR>
    <BR>TrueType Font distributed with Microsoft OS tend to reduce the size of Latin
    alphabet; the exception probably is Tahoma which is designed for screen reading.
    Designer of Tahoma squished the upper/lower vowels, tonal marks a little. So everything
    would fit in the point size. <BR> <BR>What I meant about Nosari is that, since
    the minuscule was scaled down less than the caps, so it looks too big. Besides,
    the stroke weight of Thai alphabets does not quite match the weight of   the Latin
    ones, especially the bold weight. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s see how I can post the image....

    let you know. <BR> <BR>It might be interesting to you that the first book printed
    with the Thai script was in 1828. About 60 years after the end of the Ayutthaya
    period. Before that every book used the romanization scheme you&#39;ve got. Although
    these days when Thai is transliterated, it typically doesn&#39;t use the macrons,
    horns, and such. That said, I think it&#39;d be pretty hard to do &#39;period-correct&#39;
    typography without building a new face with the requisite accented characters.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62;TrueType Font distributed with Microsoft OS  <BR> <BR>You know, the Thai
    fonts distributed with Windows have actually gone through one huge change. Originally,
    Angsana &#40;Times New Roman&#41; was Angsana UPC. These fonts were made by Unity
    Progress, a Thai company, and I believe optimized for Thai - at 14 points the
    Latin was way to small. So now Angsana is Angsana New. As are all the Thai fonts
    in the OS. Although, perhaps the UPC versions are still used in Thailand.'

    Latin and Thai in a single font, it is necessary to reduce the size of the Latin
    considerably if you want to balance it to the Thai and still allow adequate vertical
    space for the latter in the body height. Quite apart from the tall Thai glyphs,
    including three frequently occuring tall vowels, there are vowel and tone mark
    stacks to be accounted for, although the taller of these can reasonably extend
    beyond the body height. When working on a new Thai design, Fiona Ross, Tim Holloway
    and I examined a number of bilingual publications to get a sense of the conventional
    relative height and weight proportions of Latin and Thai when used together, and
    to see what works best. Sorry I can&#39;t show the result yet; suffice to say

    such analysis would be difficult or impossible because of the number of factors
    that come into play, and I can&#39;t say that any obvious correlation in Western
    type jumps out at me. <BR> <BR>For example, on average northern Europeans might
    demonstrate a greater ideal personal space than southern Europeans, but economic
    demands might nonetheless mandate tighter spacing. <BR> <BR>Still, you would expect
    ideas about space to affect many kinds of cultural expression &#40;architecture,
    for example&#41; and consequently to affect typography as well. Somehow I am having
    trouble seeing this very clearly, however. <BR> <BR>I suppose analphabetic languages
    would have a different set of rules. <BR> <BR>'

    for combining with the top vowels , a lower position when combined with the normal
    consonants, and two left-shifted position.</i> <BR> <BR>Tone marks used in stacks
    are traditionally made slightly smaller than those used directly above a letter.
    This both saves vertical space and ensures that the whole combination does not
    become top heavy. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/33069.gif"
    alt="Sukothai stacking tone marks"> <BR>Even when using something like the OpenType
    GPOS &#60;mkmk&#62; feature to build stacks, rather than having multiple non-spacing
    characters at different heights, a well made font will include these small tone
    mark variants that will be contextually substituted when preceded by a vowel mark.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant: <i>Is it offensive to move the second &#40;higher&#41; mark
    to the left of the first one, to save vertical space?</i> <BR> <BR>Questioning
    whether such a thing is offensive only addresses its acceptability to native readers,
    whose acceptance or rejection <i>may</i> be conventional. More interesting is
    to ask whether such an innovation is actually useful, and whether it makes sense
    within the structure of the writing system. <BR> <BR>The answer to the question
    &#39;Is it actually useful?&#39; has to be no. Apart from a small number of what
    may be termed double-width letters, e.g. <i>tho phuthao</i> and <i>no nen</i>,
    the Thai letters are not wide enough for diagonal left&#43;down shifting of a
    stacked tone mark to reduce the total height: there simply isn&#39;t enough space
    in which to lower the mark. If you look at the first two pairs of letters in the
    example above, which are typical of the majority of Thai letters, it is clear
    that the vowel mark occupies most of the width of the letter. Even if one were
    to shift and lower the stacked tone mark on the wider letters, the total height
    required for stacked marks is necessarily determined by the narrowest base letter.
    <BR> <BR>I also think your suggestion does not make sense within the organisational
    structure of the Thai writing system. If you look through the Font Book PDF that
    Chanop provided, you&#39;ll see that a lot of consideration is given to correct
    horizontal alignment of marks to letters &#40;see pages 61-79&#41;. There is very
    clearly a correct way to position marks, which is relative to the right-side vertical
    stroke of the base letter. <BR> <BR>The most common element in Thai text is a
    vertically organised grapheme consisting of a letter, a letter &#43; vowel, a
    letter &#43; tone, or letter &#43; vowel &#43; tone &#40;some letters may also
    take modifier subscript marks&#41;. Because the &#39;sub-atomic&#39; elements
    of the grapheme are arranged vertically, the verticality of the grapheme becomes
    an important structural concern. The verticality of the grapheme is established
    by the right-side vertical stroke of the letters, which is a feature common to
    all Thai letters: there are some letters that have no left-side vertical, e.g.
    <i>ngo ngu</i> and <i>wo waen</i>, but there are no letters that do not have a
    definite vertical stroke on the right side, even if some of these strokes do not
    ascend to the &#39;bo-height&#39;, e.g. <i>ro rua</i>, and in some letters elements,
    such as loops or flourishes, may extend horizontally beyond the right-side vertical,
    e.g. the loop in <i>no nen</i> in some styles and the tail of the ring in <i>so
    rusi.</i> <BR> <BR>In order to maintain the verticality of the grapheme, marks
    above and below the base letter are aligned relative to the right-side vertical
    stroke. The only time they are shifted to the left is for the tall letters, e.g.
    <i>fo fa</i>, in which the right-side vertical itself rises above the bo-height.
    It is worth noting that when a tall vowel such as <i>sara o</i> follows a letter
    with a mark or mark stack above, it is the tall vowel that is letter-spaced &#40;positive
    kerned&#41; to avoid a collision with the mark&#40;s&#41;: the marks are not shifted
    to the left to avoid the collision, because this would disrupt the verticality
    of the grapheme. <BR> <BR>One might ask, why is the verticality of graphemes important?
    Why is it a strictly maintained aspect of the Thai script? I suspect it is a response
    to the Thai orthography and, in particular, to the length of visually unbroken
    strings of words making up phrases. Apart from light kerning to reduce white space
    caused by some combinations of letters, e.g. <i>no nen</i> followed by &#60;/i&#62;cho
    chan&#60;/i&#62; in styles where the lower right loop on the first letter extends
    beyond the right-side vertical, well-typeset Thai text consists of discreet, vertically
    arranged graphemic units that do not interact horizontally with their neighbours.
    This makes a lot of sense in terms of clarity when one looks at the long strings
    of such graphemes between phrase breaks. The verticality of the graphemes is an
    aid to breaking these long phrases into words, by preventing horizontal interaction
    across what may be word boundaries. <BR> <BR><i>...about the DC character: why
    is it missing from the Unicode Thai encoding?</i> <BR> <BR>The zero-width space
    is not specific to Thai, so Unicode encodes only one, U&#43;200B, which is used
    by various scripts and mapped to the appropriate decimal codepoint in 8-bit codepages.'

    its acceptability to native <BR>&#62; readers, whose acceptance or rejection <BR>&#62;
    <i>may</i> be conventional. <BR> <BR>Sure, and you allude to an interesting difference
    between the sensibilities of natives versus learners: the former are more demanding
    in terms of cultural authenticity &#40;because they can feel that and they value
    it; and they can figure out &#34;warped&#34; glyphs&#41;, while the latter are
    more demanding in terms of explicit legibility &#40;because they need that just
    for basic reading; and they&#39;re not good at discerning authenticity&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>To make a font that&#39;s versatile but progressive, you would need to make
    sure learners can figure out what the new &#40;or really &#34;variant&#34;&#41;
    letterform is, but maintain the necessary cultural sensitivity. If Thai people
    really don&#39;t have much of a problem with hyper-Latinized fonts, I think they
    might be able to handle some shifting accents too. <BR> <BR>But to some extent
    you have to choose your target. And as with any culturally progressive effort,
    it makes more sense to target the natives and not the learners - for the latter
    one should just use the &#34;normal&#34; fonts. <BR> <BR>Also, different scripts
    have different proportions of people learning &#40;and <i>needing</i> to learn&#41;
    versus natives simply reading. For a script like Thai &#40;and unlike English&#41;
    which might need to provide for its natives more than learners, a progressive
    approach makes more sense &#40;as long as there&#39;s no strong threat of assimilation&#41;
    than it would elsewhere. <BR> <BR>&#62; More interesting is to ask whether such
    an <BR>&#62; innovation is actually useful, and whether <BR>&#62; it makes sense
    within the structure of the <BR>&#62; writing system. <BR> <BR>Well, of course
    that has to be established first - otherwise it&#39;s just change for its own
    sake, which I tend to see as a sort of hooliganism. The advantage of taming the
    vertical span of Thai is obvious: it allows for a better balance of apparent size
    and economy. Your issue of Thai letters &#34;not being wide enough&#34; I think
    is not only secondary, but possibly even a reason to explore improved readability
    through the introduction of greater width &#40;especially <i>variability</i> of
    width&#41; into the script! Or maybe you could vary the sizes of the accents &#40;which
    you&#39;re doing anyway&#41; - this size variation might even introduce more room
    to improve readability &#40;in the way Hangul does&#41;. <BR> <BR>There are many
    avenues to improving any script - you have to think from outside in, because that&#39;s
    where true functionality &#40;as opposed to merely following potentially half-baked
    rules&#41; comes from. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also another -probably more practical-
    advantage to taming the height: the need to reduce matching Latin &#40;and other&#41;
    fonts in size would be made less important. <BR> <BR>Basically the way in which
    Thai is using the Cartesian space is somewhat inefficient: the extreme vertical
    spikes in a body that&#39;s mostly of uniform height throws a wrench in leading,
    hence economy. Imagine writing English where just the &#34;h&#34; goes up to double
    its height. <BR> <BR>&#62; There is very clearly a correct way to position marks
    <BR> <BR>But the ever-present question in writing reform is exactly this: what
    is &#34;correct&#34;, to whom? Is what&#39;s correct to a writing scholar correct
    to the layman reader? Not as a rule, no. Some people think there&#39;s only a
    certain way a Latin &#34;r&#34; can be correct, but when you corner them they
    have no real defense of their position. And you know what I think about them...  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>People -especially as they get older- tend to like to apply what they
    know, instead of keeping an open mind. This is especially true in a craft, where
    there&#39;s constant pressure to simply and quickly produce more instances of
    something that works OK. But to some people &#34;OK&#34; is cultural death. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; Thai text consists of discreet, vertically arranged graphemic units
    that do not interact horizontally with their neighbours <BR> <BR>Ah, but maybe
    this is bad? Sure, it makes individual &#34;graphemes&#34; easier to decipher,
    but like Latin text that&#39;s too loosely spaced, maybe it reduces readability?
    Always keep in mind the difference between deliberative and immersive reading.

    that I have learned and ideas that I have developed in the process of working
    on Thai type design with experienced colleagues. I don&#39;t claim any great expertise
    in Thai, but my thoughts are grounded in the practical experience of making a
    typeface that has been described as &#39;extremely readable&#39; by a fluent reader
    and expert in the Thai script. I mention this because, in your enthusiasm, you
    sometimes seems to assume that other people are beginning from the same level

    basis. I think this can be a problem in our discussions, because I&#39;m almost
    always commenting only from direct experience. <BR> <BR>Also, your comments regarding
    the different sensibilities of natives versus learners are not at all in line
    with my experience in working with a number of scripts. Very often, I find I am
    much more concerned about the cultural authenticity of a design than native readers
    are, many of whom have grown up in a period of debasement of their national typography
    due to technical limitations, influence of outside fashions, or cultural uncertainty,
    and who may accept as normal things that are actually alien to or at best uncharacteristic
    of the longer traditions of their script. Unless they are themselves type designers,
    and working outside of contemporary fashions in graphic design, native readers
    are unlikely to do much research into such traditions, and so remain ignorant
    of what might be termed deep authenticity. I am not speaking here specifically
    about Thai; indeed, apart from some deplorable, latinising fashions in display
    type, Thai typography is in relatively good shape. But your generalisation regarding
    learners being unable to discern cultural authenticity does not seem to me to
    hold true. Cultural authenticity is something that can be apprehended from knowledge
    of a writing system and its development; natives and learners alike need to learn
    this, and can. This is not to deny that there are very insensitive non-native
    type designers making a hash of various scripts &#40;there are also native designers
    doing the same thing&#41;, but they&#39;re just not doing a good job; they are,
    in fact, neither natives nor learners: they are not bothering to learn.'

  body: John, of course I don&#39;t assume everybody knows as little as I do about
    Thai! But I do believe that different approaches and requirements allow for different
    types of &#34;solutions&#34;. You generally make highly-usable fonts that &#34;distill&#34;
    conventional ideas into a highly polished -and not unoriginal- whole. That&#39;s
    very useful, no doubt about it. But then there&#39;s a parallel need to always
    doubt existing practice, to revert to the true nature of functionality and try
    to rebuild/redirect a script. Of course tradition is part of that functionality,
    but the lines you cross will depend very much on your <i>intentions</i>. For example,
    I think this is why you advocate breaking the Latin x-height bounds for Hebrew
    &#40;which has varied conventions in that respect&#41;, but not for Cyrillic &#40;because
    virtually no other type designers do it&#41;. Following the expectations of other
    type designers &#40;and really not much anybody else, as far as I&#39;m concerned&#41;
    helps ensure greater adoption of your designs. If you made a Cyrillic font with
    an &#34;x-height&#34; greater than the one in the/a corresponding Latin font &#40;clearly
    a much better solution for the Cyrillic <i>user</i>&#41;, the General would not
    be pleased, and the Bee would give you no honey!  :-&#41; But I do hope that soon
    will find yourself in a position to innovate more. Admittedly &#40;assuming one
    has the patience&#41; first establishing a reputation for solid conventional design
    might help more people eventually accept one&#39;s innovations, but many designers
    do seem to get stuck in a rut, never leaving the comfy &#40;and materially more
    rewarding&#41; practice of simply giving people what they&#39;re used to. I really
    really wish Slimbach for example would start leveraging his commanding position
    to <i>push</i> at least just a little bit, already. <BR> <BR>As for your point
    about the types of sensibilities of different groups, I think you have to note
    how exceptional you are! Certainly, proportionally more non-native than native
    type designers have insufficient respect for a given script. I remember asking
    a few attendees of the Greek conference in 2002 what they thought of the current
    state of Greek type, and virtually all them disliked it as being inauthentic.
    Also, when you say that the average layman doesn&#39;t do any &#34;research&#34;,
    you&#39;re right, but he doesn&#39;t need to! The point is that his sensibilities
    are built implicitly over time; he doesn&#39;t need to know <i>why</i> that second
    line in my sample is problematic to simply <i>feel</i> that it is. This is the
    difference between pleasing other designers versus the -more important- users.

    sub-genres of post-Petrine text types in which I have worked to date, the Latin
    and Cyrillic scripts are historical and natural cognates. You can reject that
    style if you want, but the harmonisation with Latin is a feature of that style
    and has been for 250 years. If I were designing Cyrillic type in a different style,
    e.g. one of the Old Church Slavonic styles, I would not feel any need to harmonise
    x-height or any other feature to Latin, even if the font were to contain both
    scripts. Similarly, I can imagine new Cyrillic styles that would not naturally
    harmonise with Latin, but I&#39;d rather leave these developments to the Slavs:
    I am in every sense a &#39;learner&#39;, and don&#39;t think it is my position
    to teach <i>except</i> when my work uncovers authentic but neglected traditions
    that contemporary practitioners are ignorant of. One might put it this way: you
    seemingly never met a writing system that you didn&#39;t think you couldn&#39;t
    improve; I never met a writing system that I didn&#39;t think could improve me.
    <BR> <BR>By the way, when designing Hebrew type my choice about whether to align
    the head to the Latin x-height depends on the intended use of the font. I do prefer
    to make the Hebrew taller, and am happy that this convention is most common in
    Biblical scholarship, but when designing bi-scriptal fonts for modern office use
    in Israel I will align the heights, because this has become the prevailing convention
    in that setting. <BR> <BR>Regarding Greek, I think you should ask non-Greek type
    designers who work with Greek what they think of the current state of Greek type
    design. I think you will find that most of them are very much aware of the issue
    of authenticity, and tend to be much more concerned about it than the average
    Greek graphic designer or typographer, who are the people responsible for the
    use of inauthentic, latinised types. I recall that your visit to the conference
    was fleeting, and that you missed much of the most interesting stuff. Were you

    from such formalisms, which certainly comes at the expense of <i>true</i> visual

    think of two ways where you should try to be a teacher: <BR>1&#41; By having the
    privilege of seeing writing systems <i>as a whole</i> perform in their own ways,
    you can gain insight into how each can individually be improved. <BR>2&#41; Don&#39;t
    underestimate the advantages of being an &#34;outsider&#34;. Natives have some
    &#40;probably most&#41; of the advantage, but non-native can indeed be of benefit
    in providing a external, more objective view. When you&#39;re too close to something,
    you can&#39;t see it very clearly. <BR> <BR>&#62; you seemingly never met a writing
    system that you didn&#39;t think you couldn&#39;t <BR>&#62; improve; I never met
    a writing system that I didn&#39;t think could improve me.  <BR> <BR>You have
    also described me with your second sentence - certainly the two are not exclusive.
    Furthermore there are two aspects to what I&#39;m saying, and you shouldn&#39;t
    bundle them: one is indeed script reform &#40;like moving Thai accents around&#41;,
    while the other is clearly within the context of type design &#40;like making
    the Cyrillic &#34;x-height&#34; bigger than the Latin&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    Greek: yes, you have a point. But overall it&#39;s pretty obvious that non-natives
    generally care less than natives. This is common sense. <BR> <BR>Thomas, you probably
    weren&#39;t asking me, but: I find that the Paratype Cyrillics are the same as
    most any other Cyrillics: way too harmonized on the superficial level, but as
    a result discordant on the true functional level - the bane of Modernism in fact.
    Anybody with an understanding of the difference between display and text type
    &#40;as well as an ability to be objective&#41; can see this clearly. <BR> <BR>hhp

    the same form, weight and size. The fact is that, for better or for worse, the

    this way: i.e. to make the same use of Cartesian space. This is the point at which

    <BR> <BR>Even if I agree with your benchmark for &#34;cognation&#34;&#42;, there&#39;s
    a problem with this particular statement: when I say &#34;usage of the Cartesian
    space&#34;, I mean to include not just the shape and extend of structural elements,
    but also the frequency of usage of the different sections of the space. This is
    important because the visual information conveyed by text &#40;and expected by
    the reader&#41; is totally dependent on how often ascenders and descenders pop
    up for example - and of course Latin and Cyrillic are very different in this respect&#42;&#42;.
    This is in fact why the problem with a congruent x-height comes up: because Cyrillic
    uses the ascender and descender space far less, it ends up having a smaller apparent
    size &#40;same as in Thai, like Chanop pointed out&#41;. And in the case of a
    book in both languages for example, this will cause the Russian setting to look
    &#34;less important&#34; - which is clearly more of a problem than lack of geometric
    congruence at the mico level &#40;something only designers notice anyway&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Although even in the formal realm &#40;not to mention the practical,
    &#34;user&#34; realm&#41; it does seem problematic. For example, what script pair

    Think of the accented caps in Latin. <BR> <BR>But I guess it&#39;s a matter of
    thresholds, and an accent would have to be <i>very</i> rare to be safely ignorable.
    Looking at the frequencies, mai_han-akat/mai_tho isn&#39;t rare enough either,
    so fooling only with the sara_ii/sara_uee might be pointless. On the other hand,
    mai_han-akat might be able to &#34;cradle&#34; a higher accent in a way that sara_ii/sara_uee
    can&#39;t. So you still gain a bit just by addressing those. If you work your
    way down and start fooling with the worst cases first, and eventually stop at
    a good threshold, you can gain some room. But it has to appear consistent too,

    in two ways, either by doing a buffered character substitution to the PUA codepoint
    or by applying OpenType Layout features. The latter is preferable; also one can
    use OpenType for additional substitutions, not handled on a character-to-PUA basis
    by the basic engine &#40;e.g. ligation of <i>po pla</i> and <i>mai han-akat</i>
    and substitution of small stacking forms for tone marks&#41;. <BR> <BR>The kind
    of buffered character substitution used in the older approach is the most benign
    kind of PUA use -- certainly much better than actually using PUA characters in
    the text stream --, but it is still reliant on wholly private agreement about
    which PUA codepoints to use. There is nothing to stop another software vendor
    from specifiying a different PUA for the same Thai variant glyphs, in which case
    your fonts only reliably work in specific, narrow environments.

    Also, the documentation on Microsoft&#39;s Thai shaping specifies the mark &amp;

    absolutely necessary for the shaping to work? Or is it possible to do everything
    with GSUB?  <BR> <BR>E.g., can you substitute <i>mai ek</i> &#40;0E48&#41; with
    its variant at F70A when it follows a consonant&#0151;rather than <i>positioning</i>
    it lower? Or is that inadvisable because it destroys the underlying text stream?  <BR>

    than GPOS &#39;kern&#39; and even that is rather spottily done. <BR> <BR>One can
    do a lot of this via GSUB, although it may be less efficient in some cases &#40;particularly
    for TrueType fonts, it will bloat the font file size a lot&#41;. Assuming the
    app does things in a sane fashion, GSUB won&#39;t destroy the underlying text

    combining marks, i.e. kerning between base letters when the presence of combining
    marks above or below has no impact on the desired base-to-base spacing, but at
    other times you want to kern off the combining marks, e.g. when <i>sara o</i>
    follows a combination of bo-height base with one or two marks above. So you need
    to appropriately set the LookupFlag bits in individual lookups.
