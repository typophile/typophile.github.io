  used 15pt Minion for the title and 15pt Legacy SC for the author name. The body
  is set in 11/15 Minion. \r\n\r\nThe page is 39 x 51p. \r\nThe textblock is 26 x
  39p.\r\n\r\ninside margin: 3.833p\r\ntop margin: 5p\r\noutside margin: 9.1666p\r\nbottom
  margin: 7p\r\n\r\nI'm curious what people think of the large title size and if the
  leading for the body is too high. Also would like to hear thoughts on the block
  dimensions and location on the page. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n\r\nps-I've
  a NYTimes article as dummy text.\r\n"

  body: "For me is the author name that looks too big. I also would try to let more
    space between the title/author and the body text, or less space between the title
    and the author.\r\nJust my opinion.\r\n\r\ndaniele"
