  body: 'Although Fournier is known to have been inspired by the RdR in making his
    own fonts, his stuff was much more conventional in nature. The RdR style is very
    distinctive: it is a &#34;constructed&#34; letter, with vertical stress, high
    contrast, a smallish x-height, and most notably double serifs on the ascenders.
    It also exhibits a short line on the lc &#34;el&#34; &#40;which apparently Grandjean
    introduced because the constructivism was leading to confusable forms&#41;, but
    to me that&#39;s not critical to its nature. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a metal RdR-style
    font, the &#34;Types de Charles X&#34; of the Imprimerie Nationale: <BR> <BR><img

    more like Fournier to me, but the one you&#39;re showing looks almost like Didot.
    The short line on the &#34;el&#34; is present in both samples. <BR> <BR>Are you

  body: 'Wow, nice! Yeah, that&#39;s definitely the RdR. I&#39;m not really a revivalist,
    but when an entire category of type design is so neglected, there&#39;s certainly
    good reason to at least make one digital instance. Like in Thom&#39;s Thai project
    it would be perfect. But I wouldn&#39;t revive the RdR itself, it was still only
    a formative effort &#40;look how conventional the italics are for example&#41;
    - I would revive the later, higher form, done by Tuleu &#40;at Deberny&#41; -
    a design as obscure as it is phenomenal. <BR> <BR>Arnhem: You&#39;re not saying

  body: hhp, the article shows a RdR sample in parapraph 2 siting it as part of the

  body: 'Addison, you&#39;re right - I was just wondering if you saw something in
    Arnhem that alluded to the RdR somehow - not because I&#39;d get on your case

    <BR> <BR>Tuleu was the bastard son of Deberny, and he ran the foundry in the last
    quarter of the 19th century. He took the RdR style to its pinnacle&#42;, only
    to be undercut by a double whammy: the Arts &amp; Crafts revival of Morris; and
    Gustave Peignot&#39;s obsession with display typography: the Deberny and Peignot
    houses merged in 1923, and Gustave&#39;s charisma and business sense caused all
    of the wonderful old Deberny text faces to get tossed out. <BR> <BR>&#42; The
