  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My client says he &ldquo;already paid&rdquo; an editor $6,000 to set the type, do page flow, etcetera. He thinks he should not have to pay for it done again. His editor only has it in a word document. I think page numbering is already done and fonts are already chosen by his editor in word, so he also thinks this doesn&rsquo;t need to be done.</p>
<p>I want him to understand the value a designer can bring to his book. How do I help my client understand this with kindness and being confident but not obnoxious? I do not know how to explain to him what the difference is between what I do when I do the book, layout, and type design, and the typesetting, and what his editor did.  He doesn&rsquo;t understand what goes into choosing the size, the different distinguishments of type (fonts, style and spacing) for different kinds of text. He doesn&rsquo;t know how much time goes into typesetting (Paragraph styles, character styles, assigning them to the text one piece of text at a time). I don&rsquo;t want to make him angry and defensive, but his editor didn&rsquo;t do what I will do, and you guys understand. He just isn&rsquo;t a designer and doesn&rsquo;t understand at all. How do you guys explain the value of design to clients?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help and responses!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The bad guy here is the editor who should have made it clear from the outset that he is an editor not a book designer. I&rsquo;m not sure your client understands the role of an editor; I&rsquo;m not sure the editor understands the role of an editor.</p>
<p>When forced up against this wall, I would hurry to find examples of Word documents turned directly into books and examples of well designed books.</p>
<p>Or, go out on a limb and do a rough design.</p>
<p>Have a fireside chat with your client about the subconscious impact of good vs bad design. Bad design can lead to nonsale or, worse, to a serious blemish on your client as a serious author.</p>
<p>Good luck. It&rsquo;s stuff like this that earns you the big bucks <g>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m not really sure what you could do at this point. If it was typeset in MS Word, then that&rsquo;s what need to be printed unless the client wants to have it paid to be redone. I agree that this is a huge oversight by the editor (Then again, I don&rsquo;t work in the book publishing world, so maybe I&rsquo;m oblivious to the fact that most books are typeset in MS Word&hellip;as hard as that would be to believe ;o) )</div>
