body: "Hello to all you esteemed experts out there,\r\n\r\nI need some practical help
  with finishing my logo for an independent travel operator for the British market
  specialising in the travel to the authentic middle-east like Jordan, Syria and Oman
  among others.\r\n\r\nAs a new start-up and completely inexperienced in commissioning
  these things, I had the logo designed last year way before I had even a vague idea
  about how it would be used. Consequently, aside from a slight change to the shape
  of the dome and colours of the logo, I signed off on something that looked good
  but suffered on legibility when I began to 'road test' it.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  the original, and also where I am right now with it, key changes are:\r\n1. Removed
  the reflected line as that was doing anything but enhance name recognition!\r\n2.
  Change the Uppercase B in Bedouin.travel to a lowercase b so that it read more like
  the web address (bedouin.travel)it was meant to.\r\n\r\nThe company is not far off
  commencing trading and I need to get on with nailing the logo and print letterhead,
  compliment slips and business cards (for starters!) in a way that where its appearance
  is consistent across all three.\r\n\r\nI have a few questions to the logo in its
  current form:\r\n1. Given that my websites are going to be bedouin.travel, bedouintravel.me,
  bedouintravel.hu and finally bedouin.aero, I'm wondering whether the dome ligature
  might work equally, if not better, on the u and n of the word bedouin.\r\n2. Can't
  quite get the right colour for the logo, was thinking a bright vibrant orange as
  reminiscent of the heat of the desert rather than a washed out yellow of desert
  sand. If you can show a colour with pantone that you think works better< I'd appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n3. Does someone have an idea, even a sketch, that blows the
  current logo away?\r\n\r\nEven though funds as a yet to launch start-up are limited,
  I'm willing to pay something if need be for any suggested major redesign or amendment
  that I wish to pursue, wouldn't want anyone to think I'm putting this out there
  to save money, it's more for the increased scrutiny/eye for design/refinement of
  the typophile community that I just couldn't find ANYWHERE else.\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  for your assistance\r\nSaqib "

  body: "The original logo has not uploaded well, never mind, it was only to show
    that the b was formerly a B and that there used to be a reflection.\r\n\r\nThe
    last sentence was supposed to convey the fact that I am not even aware of many
    of the criteria with which I need to be able to critique my company logo. (Its
    nearly 3am here in London and my mind is getting mangled enough not to be able
    to express myself more clearly!)\r\n\r\nS.>"

  body: "1. I would agree with your idea that the ligature should be placed over the
    \"u\" and \"n\". That's the unique word (travel isn't) and it's the one that's
    consistent throughout your site iterations.\r\n\r\n2. As for color, are you intending
    to use this orange on black? if not, upload it on different background colors
    such as paper or an alternate color you'd like to use for your identity. That
    way we get a better feel for how well the main orange color will work across a
    variety of placements.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "well, when I first saw your logo I had no idea what that curvy thing on the
    \"r\" and \"a\" of travel was and why it was there. Is it the top of a mosque?
    Regardless of what it is, I don't think it fits there. It could easily be mistaken
    for a leaf or a wishbone.\r\n\r\nI don't think the period delimiter makes it look
    more like a website than \"bedouin travel\". In fact, take that period and place
    it above the \"i\" -- or just get rid of it. Right now it looks like you're trying
    to be \"l337\" like uber.pwnage or h0t.d0gs\r\n\r\nyour \"b\" has a straight cutoff
    on the bottom left corner, however, your \"d\" does not. \r\n\r\nit sounds like
    you're on a tight deadline. Try to find a muslim influenced script in place of
    your serif font. That way there's no need for motifs if you already establish
    the muslim or middle eastern feel you're going for. If that sounds too clich\xE9
    then go get a nice serif font and try making some of the changes above. I think
    it will lessen some confusion."

  body: "Dear Penn and MrK,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments, Penn - your first point
    is what I too was thinking as I have no Graphic Design skills I will perhaps wait
    and see if someone comes up withsomething better before getting a designer to
    try it so I can have a look see. As for the background colour, I guess it needs
    to work with White firstly, and then if possible, with Black too, the text colour
    though has to be something evocative of the desert.\r\n\r\nMrK, I don't want to
    make the dome any more overt as a great many of my customers will not be muslim
    and I don't want them to necessarily feel excluded. Interestingly those that have
    been coming to the business with an islamic eye have tended to spot it quicker
    than those not looking at it from that angle.\r\n\r\nAm open to moving the period
    around but I did quite like the idea of keeping it all as a web address though
    I didn't understand the '1337' comment. As for the bottom of the b, I can see
    why you thought that, I though it too and it was the first thing that I pointed
    out in the amendment though surprisingly it didn't look as good somehow.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for taking the time so far...\r\n\r\n"
