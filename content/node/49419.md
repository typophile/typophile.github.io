body: "Hi \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me id these two typefaces please....\r\n\r\nThe
  first one is an  elegant serif, that one of my local galleries have used for an
  exhibition flyer...\r\n\r\nThe second one is a dotted sans serif that feels like
  its based on avant garde / century gothic , but the g dimensions are different from
  both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first post i have done on this site as i joined
  a week ago - i think its a really good idea to share information on design and i
  will try my best to help other people as well \r\n\r\n- thankyou for setting the
  site up.\r\n"
