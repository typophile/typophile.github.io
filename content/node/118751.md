  body: I think you have it Don, The leg on the R seems to be the sticking point -
    I have found several things that seem to match every thing but the straight leg
    on the R.

    it. In any case, both versions fit well with the overall design of the font.\r\nDon"

    to Jaspert, Berry and Johnson this was originally a German design, cut by \u201CJohn
    in Hambury in 1892\u201D for Stephenson, Blake & Co. Original English name is
    Doric 1 Italic, but it was released by various foundries under other names including
    Old Gothic Bold and Washington."

    in addition to the summary in Jaspert's _The Encyclopedia of Typefaces [1970]_.\r\nThe
    font was released in the U.S. by American Typefounders Company in 1898. Here is
    the release specimen published by _The Inland Printer_: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DoricItalicATF1898SM_3584.jpg]\r\nA
    rather different use than for an attractive model with a swinging 60s camera.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Albert Jan for the correct provenance. Jaspert is usually reliable
    but it seems that Hamburg became \"Hambury\" and the designer Johannes John and
    the foundry J John S\xF6hne were lumped together as simply \"John.\" Rather misleading.\r\nDon"
