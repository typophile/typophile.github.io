body: would love to ID this short-lived logo change.  It's something that's not quite
  Bauhaus, not quite Blippo.  It's probably an amalgamation, but if someone can ID
  a single font type, well that would pretty much make my day :)  I do know that this
  was probably only used from sometime in the 70s until 1983 at the latest, and during
  that time it changed a bit along the way (see [[http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=648867|this
  forum thread]])

  body: looks pretty accurate; in fact the 'i' looks right, too.  Just the 'r' looks
    mod'ed. Whee-hoo!!  Thanks ya :)
