		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments, gentlemen. It&#39;s true that extra hours can be an issue that causes hard feelings between an employer and an employee. I&#39;m happy to say that in this instance the issue has already been discussed and resolved. :-&#41;  <BR> <BR>John, how long did you work at the office you mentioned? Were you able to influence the principals reading habits at all? <BR> <BR>&#34;Look, listen, share, ask, contribute,... &#34; Good advice for any number of arenas. Ditto, sharing food, although I must say it seems to be more of a challenge these days to find something that fits into everyone&#39;s diet.  <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>Any other work-related stories you wish to share? <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">They were very much set in their ways. The funny thing was that they subscribed to both Print and CA, but they did so because that&#39;s what design companies do, not because they were interested in reading the magazines. I knew that place was the wrong fit for me, but I stayed a year because I wanted to give them a fair try. <BR> <BR>Another suggestion I&#39;d have is to do things to keep design fun, even if the stuff you&#39;re working on isn&#39;t fun.

I worked a weekend of training in spring, but by summer  my dad had helped me get a job at Ampex in the technical publications department. He was an engineer there &#40;ah, nepotism&#41;. They did ask me back for a second summer however, so I think I did OK. The unofficial red-shirt-day custom that I mentioned in my first post was started by one of the writers there.  </div>
