  Do they still have in-house designers? Or is have they shifted to just being a publisher
  of type?\r\n\r\nAlso does anyone know if Apple plans to improve opentype in Leopard?\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    still works full time as a product manager for their font department and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30908\">Robert
    Slimbach</a> still designs type full time, as far as I know. The dept. may be
    much smaller than a few years ago, but it is still active.\r\n\r\nYou can read
    more about their latest work, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30223\">Arno</a>,
    and Phinney has something of his own coming out soon. Maybe he can tell us more."

  body: "Adobe still has a type group of about ten people. In fact, we just hired
    a new font production person and budding type designer last spring (and advertised
    the position on Typophile, my blog, and many other places) - Typophile regular
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/19493> Miguel Sousa</a>.\r\n\r\nThese days,
    we release on average about two type families a year, many of which win awards.
    Mostly it's in-house designs from Robert Slimbach, and occasional outside designs
    commissioned to cover languages we don't have in-house expertise for. So recently
    we've had Arabic, Hebrew and Thai fonts made for us by Tiro Typeworks, for example.\r\n\r\nThe
    pace of new releases has slowed considerably, in part due to a smaller staff,
    but even more due to the huge growth in complexity and size of our typefaces.
    Looking at our last big release and our next couple of releases, it looks like
    our typical new typeface has about 3000 glyphs per font. This is the result of
    both language support and typographic features.\r\n\r\nComing up, we have two
    new typefaces to debut this spring. Robert Slimbach's Arno Pro has already been
    seen in beta form, bundled with the Photoshop CS3 public beta, and has been the
    subject of a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30223\">Typophile thread</a>\r\n\r\nMy
    own Hypatia Sans Pro is in the works. We're running out of time, so Miguel and
    Robert will be doing the kerning, with me just keeping an eye on it and making
    a few suggestions. Meanwhile I've been spending my time polishing the outlines,
    with considerable input from Robert.\r\n\r\nRobert's typeface \"Gauge\" (working
    title only) is more of a prototype at this point, and I can't tell you anything
    about a release date, but it can be seen to some extent in the new Adobe product
    icons that have been <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/images/wheel-o%27-icons.html\">blogged
    about</a>\r\n\r\nChristopher Slye has been busy with the tiny project of doing
    technical fixes to our entire library, for a planned future dot release.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and don't ask me about schedule for any of the above. I can't say, except that
    Arno and Hypatia Sans will ship with some Adobe products in the near future.\r\n\r\nSo,
    we're not dead yet.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: So where does the name for Hypatia Sans come from? And since it's specifically
    called a sans, does that mean that there is a serif in the works as well?

    you're a roofer, I guess.  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hypatia_6301.jpg]\r\nIF
    this in fact the inspiration for Thomas' new font, then I'm gonna make a wild
    slightly educated guess.\r\n\r\nThe typeface will be a humanist sans. It will
    be an update of a classical Greek typeform, but not in the vein of Lithos Pro.
    It will be more more influenced by the Roman letterforms of similar era, with
    classical proportions used by many of the great serif typefaces such as Jensen,
    Granjon, etc.\r\n\r\nIt will be a humanist sans, but not as rounded as Cronos
    Pro. It will be more geometric, with straight edges and possibly slight flaring
    ALA Optima or Beorcana.\r\n\r\nAnd the lc i's will have little hearts for dots.~\r\n"

  body: "Dan, \r\n\r\npretty good guess. Thomas already showed little bits and pieces
    of his typeface during his <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/Advanced%20MM%20theory.pdf\">Advanced
    MM Theory</a> talks at TypeCon and ATypI, so I won\u2019t break any tabus by saying
    that Hypatia Sans is a sanserif with a geometric structure, very slightly flared
    strokes, classic uppercase proportions (will go well with Trajan Pro) and an interesting
    lowercase (small x-height/long ascenders and descenders, short spurs on the ascenders).
    The lighter weights of Hypatia remind me of Rudolf Koch's Kabel a bit. \r\n\r\nNot
    sure about the hearts though. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Yes, it's named after Hypatia of Alexandria. I was looking for an interesting
    philosopher who was into geometry, so as to imply a straddling of the humanist
    and geometric genres.\r\n\r\nThe \"sans\" in the name does leave the door open
    for other variants, but we'll see how exhausted I am after this one. 3000 glyphs
    per font is about 2000 more than I really want to do again. However, I do occasionally
    fantasize about doing a slab serif, and then finally a serifed face in the same
    extended family. However, I have another (smaller) type design project ahead of
    that in my queue, and I still need to finish Hypatia Sans. So don't hold your
    breath for any other variants.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    to put it into the realm of TNR or Helvetica.~\r\n\r\nSo I can guess that it's
    a hybrid geometric/humanist sans, but I predict that the only team that can beat
    New Orleans in the Super Bowl is the Patriots? I don't think I'll quit my day
    job."
