body: "I believe this vintage tabloid nameplate is hand-lettered, but I'm looking
  for a font that is similar to facilitate a replication. These very small jpgs are
  all the reference I can find: there is apparently no known copy of the actual newspaper
  extant. Does anyone have a recommendation for something that looks much the same?\r\n\r\nAny
  input would be much appreciated."

  body: I think Goudy Heavyface is the best match. The headlines in the newspaper
    are all done in various weights of Goudy.  Thanks!
