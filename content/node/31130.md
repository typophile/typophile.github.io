  Couldn't find one, so I made one. \r\n\r\nThis uses the silkscreen typeface available
  at <a href:\"http://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/index.html\">Kottke.org</a>,
  a widely used typeface for this use. I had to recreate the logo for 15 pixels because
  the favicon is 16 pixels and looks like poop when squooshed.\r\n\r\nAnyone else
  have a badge variation? Also, feel free to use this one if you want to represent.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophilebadge_6112.png]"

    about\" already by virtue of introducing them here.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I
    prefer Eben's versions. I'm betting that in the Typophile\xAE Brand Guidelines
    that reside in Joe/Jared's heads, the T logo needs more space around it."

    Ah well.\r\n\r\nAnyway, since I know a ton of us have and use blogs, it would
    be nice, hint hint, to have an official badge. Hint hint."

    I used to work in pixel based art dept for video games so the temptation was too
    strong... And I think Dan has a point.

    and to your proposed designs.<br><BR>\r\n\r\nThe T is always intended to vary
    in the materials we've produced. It just happens that the block T works really
    well for the browser icon and has now taken over the page header. So, it's natural
    that the badge use the same T at this size.<br><BR>\r\n\r\nI think I prefer the
    solid red or solid gray rectangle (with subtle border) that Eben posted. It does

  body: "Those updated ones look great! I still like the red box on grey version,
    but they all look stellar. Thanks!\r\n\r\nI gotta ask, how do you get that sleek
    almost 3d feeling with stuff so small? In fact, since you said you worked with
    pixels before, is there some kind of rules or guidelines for working with stuff
    so small?\r\n\r\nSince Thunderbird doesn't have an official badge, but Firefox
    does, I tried to make to match it. It's hard! Trying to get the logo to condense
    was the worst. At first I just shrank it down, but it looked like crap. Then I
    progressively shrank it in increments of 50% with bicubic sharper. That helped
    a lot. But how to get the <em>feel</em> of the original, or of yours, is beyond
    me.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff2b80x15_3696.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tbadge_4116.png]"

  body: "Hmmm \r\n\r\nI don't know. Do you mean the text or the shading? One way to
    suss out what happeing in a micro pixel thing you like is to zoom in close & check
    out what happening on a pixel by pixel basis. The gradient on some is just a gradient
    but made quite faint or subtle. The edge is just a sigle pixel line on the top
    & left 100% white dialed back to 45% or so and the bottom is 100% black dialed
    back to 20% or so. #6 has a trick hard pixel shadow. It's on a dark red so it
    doesn't read as what it is which is just hard black pixels. The last 3 are just
    2 color... Having a pixel friendly logo helps as well of course. And you gave
    me a head start with those letters. I think if I was doing it for cash I might
    have done some subvisible pixel shading for the Y.\r\n\r\nThere used to be really
    intense pixel centered tools available in the game industry. They were insanely
    cool. Photoshop is great but it's not pixel centered. Sometimes when I see the
    best pixel art I think \" I bet they have an old mac running studio 8 or studio
    32...\".\r\n\r\nBTW You are right to work in steps of 50% exactly to maintain
    as much sharpness as possble. It will still suck - but less... \r\n\r\nSometimes
    you just have to start editing over the mush you make. Having a way to see what
    you are doing up close & at 100% very fast or at once is a huge help as well.
    \ Having vector art to scale can help too. The macromdia fireworks was allways
    more pixel aware than the Adobe tools were. Not sure why.\r\n\r\nWhat don't you
    like about your thundrbird badge anyway?\r\n\r\nIt does seem like you don't want
    to have both logos is such as small space perhaps. It makes it too hard I think.
    Or maybe have the logos side by side on the left & then let the words be unbroken
    on the right? Or is that two badges? \r\n\r\nIf so, the issue might just be that
    thunderbird's logo doesn't shrink well which is hardly your fault. Perhaps just
    keep the head, and then you can let the text be on one line? Then the head is
    bigger.\r\n\r\nActually I just went to your blog & I think your thunderbird bage
    looks quite good there! I am tempted to takle it all back!"

    face. Bring Times New Roman Back. It obviously is in need of saving, so I thought
    it was a tad humorous to choose as a temporary theme.
