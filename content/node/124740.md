    body: Curiously, how can you tell? And if it is a hand-lettered nameplate, is
      there a way for me to replicate it? Thanks for your reply!

  body: "First, I did a visual search for it on three major type databases. No hits.\r\n\r\nSecond,
    the era. In 1961, something like this would be done by a lettering artist, not
    a typesetter.\r\n\r\nA digital typeface that evokes the same vibe would be Mr.
    Rafkin, by Sudtipos. It\u2019s based on the sort of hand-lettering prevalent in
    advertising until the advent of the desktop computer:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/mr-rafkin/\r\n\r\nTo
    replicate the nameplate, search on Google for the largest, clearest sample of
    the magazine cover you can find. Then import the image into Adobe Illustrator
    and autotrace the logo to create a vector version."

  body: "EDITED:\r\nA leading men's magazine of the era, but without the \"skin\"
    or soft pornographic content of _The Gent_ or _Playboy_, was _Esquire_. It's title
    was digitized by Harold Lohner as Esquivel [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Esquivel_4414.gif]
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EsquivelAsEsquire_4874.jpg] http://haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/esquivel/\r\n_Gent_
    was a minor competitor. I looks to me like the design of the _Gent_ title is intended
    at least in part -- note the double story _E_ -- to imitate the flavor of the
    _Esquire_ title.\r\nAnother font with the \"same vibe\" would be the lowercase
    of Holly Script [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HollyscriptAs_gent_4111.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/holly-script/\r\nDon\r\n"

    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GentMagazine1959eDetail_3998.jpg]\r\n\r\nLooks
    somewhat like Ondine might look if it underwent a techno-transfomation.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if there are any fonts with this type of heavy running script?\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
