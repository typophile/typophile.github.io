    to get the feeling this is hand lettered because of the o&#39;s and the unevenness
    of the baseline&#41;, what&#39;s the closest approximation?'

  body: My first thought was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rapier/rapier/testdrive.html?s=Handbook&amp;p=96"
    target=_top>Rapier</a>, but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/blaze-itc/italic/testdrive.html?s=Handbook&amp;p=96"
    target=_top>Blaze</a> might be a bit closer. <BR> <BR>Neither has the b &amp;
    d loops that soften the sharpness though. <BR><br> <BR><br>

  body: Here&#39;s a couple more suggestions. Take a look at Letraset&#39;s <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=LFT1056900">Pendry
    Script</a>, which has a similar weight and feel to it, albeit more formalized.
    And <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?Image=JBT0000047">Scriptorama Tradeshow</a>
    from Jukebox may be bulkier than what you;re looking for, but it certainly retains
    the same casual flavour of the period.

  body: Hey. I must admit I&#39;m amazied at the level of expertise and detail regarding
    fonts. <BR>If I could impose on someone definitely more knowledgable than myslelf
    out there, could someone point me in the right direction id&#39;ing the font that
    they use for the words &#34;Los Angeles Times&#34; or &#34;New York Times&#34;.  Not
    the story text or the banners, but the actual words are in a very ornate type
    with lots of extra lines and serifs, and it looks very old english.  Is there
    even a font like that, or do they just create an image and use that?  I think
    its on every page in a smaller version, I could scan and post one.  Thanks
