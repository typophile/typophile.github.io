  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Perhaps this has been posted on before, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure. 
I notice that often fonts get picked on for overuse (see Archer) yet somehow I notice that &ldquo;Brothers&rdquo; by Emigre gets used more and more and no one seems to notice. To quote the great Mugatu &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m taking crazy pills over here!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understand that it is a very nice looking font that has become immensely popular even though it is over 15 years old. What bothers me is that it seems to be taking advantage of the fact that a client might not notice that their Microbrew label looks EXACTLY LIKE that other microbrew label. I even read a piece in a well-regarded logo book where a design firm claimed to find the &ldquo;Logotype&rdquo; from researching old shipping crates, when it is clearly BROTHERS!!!</p>
<p>Would love to get others thoughts on this&hellip;.should I just give up and put Brothers on everything?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Given that John Downer, the designer of Brothers, is a sign painter by trade (with undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine art), I’d guess that he brought that hand-made aesthetic to his design for Brothers. That doesn’t rule out the possibility that his references included type found on old shipping crates, and that your microbrew logo designers worked from similar sources.</p>
<p>If you can provide the name of the brewery (or the logo book), I’d love to compare it to Brothers.</p>
<p>But you are quite right about the ubiquity of the style. I see it everywhere these days. Much like the “hipster” logo style that involves some form of crossed line elements and “rustic” type, the steampunk/woodcut/hand-carved aesthetic of Brothers (and typefaces like it) has become shorthand for “authentic.”</p>
<p>All to entice young professionals with too few frames of reference and too much disposable income to spend three times the going rate for a basic cast iron frying pan (a la Best Made Company).</p>
<p>Resist the urge to resort to shorthand&hellip;..</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There&rsquo;s unpleasant gender connotations as well. Hipsters used to be at least a bit challenging of traditional gender roles – now embodying a faux ultramasculinity is all the rage, with the so-called &ldquo;lumbersexual&rdquo; trend. Brothers is almost always used in applications which are socially constructed as tediously, single-mindedly masculine in contemporary society; no matter its orgins as neutral, slightly refined signage, it&rsquo;s now reduced to boorish, unrefined cliché.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>jvankriedt, the Fidelis Co. logo is a nearly 95% match to Brothers (about as definitive a match as you can get with image recognition software and a relatively small sample image).</p>
<p>John Downer is based in Iowa City, Iowa (though he is from the Pacific Northwest). I’m not buying the Fidelis designer’s tale of “nineteenth-century product crates.”</p>
<p>Birdseeding, I agree about the gender connotations of such branding. I signed up for Best Made Company’s emails because they are beautifully designed and I wanted to understand how they were constructed/programmed, but they engender more disbelief and humor than product lust. $100 for a 6&quot; cast iron skillet? Ridiculous. And what urban bohemian needs to spend $300+ on an axe? (and why would they need one?).</p>

<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the designers <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> look at 19th century crates. They may have done that, then found an existing typeface that perfectly embodied that aesthetic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m the designer of the Fidelis Co. Brand. Of course the typeface used is Brothers! I simply wasn&rsquo;t asked which typeface it was in the interview. The spirit I used Brothers in was indeed <em>inspired</em> by typography on antique shipping crates.</p>
<p>Brothers is a strong display typeface, especially when used to convey a specific visual language. It was perfect for this particular client and business, at the particular time that the mark was designed. I agree that this style of typography has recently exploded into ubiquity, and I love that Brothers is a 15+ year old typeface enjoying a newfound popularity.</p>
<p>As the owner of an all women-run design studio, I&rsquo;m highly enjoying the investigation into Brother&rsquo;s connotations of &ldquo;socially constructed as tediously, single-mindedly masculine in contemporary society&rdquo; etc. I don&rsquo;t disagree. Those connotations work perfectly with the business this mark represents.</p>
