body: I have been using an online image creation site for several years, mainly due
  to their excellent selection of fonts. Well, last month they closed up shop and
  have left me hanging. I have been using this one font for my company logos and such
  and need to find it ASAP! They called it Manhattan, but all searches for that name
  show a totally different font. See and example image at http://www.cfmagic.com/font/list_new.gif
  and more are available if needed. This very distinctive font uses lots of triangles,
  like for the dot on the i and the lower slash on the f. Anyway, any help would be
  great! Thanks in advance!

  body: "The font is called Novel Gothic. I have it in an old collection of PhotoLettering
    fonts that was published in an Expresiv Fonts collection in 1994 by Tiger Direct,
    Inc.  I suspect it is being circulated on the web under a variety of names.  You
    can see it in the Dover Solotype Catalog on page 164.\r\n\r\nPrecision Type used
    to carry this font in the Font Company collection. Font Factory (www.fontfactory,com)
    now seems to have this collection and asks you to write to them if you are interested.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Seeing as how the Font Factory most certainly does not own the rights to
    this old typeface, I'll point you to the other versions of Novel Gothic (specifically,
    Bold) that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\nThere's WSI's Trimble, Fontbank's <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/nonce_bold.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Nonce Bold</a>, Brendel's <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Napoli Extrabold</a> and Brendel's <a href=\"http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Nimrod</a>.\r\n\r\nWSI's font is likely a ripoff of one of the
    others. As such, I'll not post a link to it. In any case, only Nimrod is a match
    for your (as in the original) 'i' and 'g'."
