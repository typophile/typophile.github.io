body: "Hi Everyone:\r\n\r\nI have been working on a new script similar to Fugu. Where
  Fugu was very relaxed and informal, there is a bit of attitude with Nori. It is
  a bit more expressive,\r\n<!--break-->\r\nmuch more activity and movement with the
  brush this time\u2014each lowercase letter has at least 2 alternates if not more,
  each uppercase letter has an oversized more energetic alternate. I am at the point
  in my process where I start compiling my selection of ligatures...some I have already
  brushed out, some I will compile digitally and others I will go back and produce...
  I started with the usual suspects but wanted to keep it unique and thought I could
  turn it over to the type-obsessed community for suggestions and advice... to make
  it more fun, I thought I'd offer up a free license of the completed font to a randomly
  selected 'contributor' through, twitter, facebook and typophile forums...\r\n\r\nBear
  in mind, I am completely open to suggestions regarding the look, feel, flow of this
  typeface.\r\n\r\nI will supply a few screenshots, please let me know what you think
  and what you would like to see.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNeil\r\n\r\nI am including
  attachments of the primary and alternative character set and a small passage set
  in the primary character set."

  body: 'This is my suggestion: don''t use any ligatures at all. Instead, use variant
    letters that connect in intelligent ways and use contextual substitution rules
    to implement them. This is much more efficient than making dozens or hundreds
    of precomposed ligature glyphs.'

  body: "thanks to both of you.\r\n\r\nI think I might try to marry John's idea while
    at the same time attending to necessary pairs. Even though I know contextual alternates
    could handle much of this, I am not confident in the available applications out
    there fully supporting calt.\r\n\r\nthanks again!"
