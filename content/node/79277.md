    horizontal stripe.  Maybe you could do something interesting with the xx or with
    the i.\r\n\r\nThe idea below popped into my head for some reason...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PROXXIO_6175.jpg]"

  body: "r seems unbalanced. Maybe you could shorten the \"faucet\" (also its terminal
    angle doesn\u2019t match any other)."

  body: "Thanks guys.\r\n\r\n@riccard0 The upper curve of the facet is the exact curve
    of the o. The lower curve is adjusted. I will play with it a little more.\r\n\r\n@
    JamesM I will tighten the xx just a little bit more. Thanks for your suggestion
    but i think I will go for an additional mark in front of the wordmark. If you
    have any suggestions??\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of shorten the p just a little
    bit and maybe making it look a little bit lighter by playing with the o bit?"

    If you have any suggestions??\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to research the logos
    of their competitors (both for inspiration and also to avoid accidental duplication),
    and then spend a whole bunch of time coming up with concepts that communicate
    the company's qualities and goals and also differentiates it from the competition."

  body: About the r, I meant the angle at which the curve is cut, not the curve itself.

  body: Yeah, the r is definitely off. It should <em>not</em> be based on o's curves.

  body: That last one is much better. Still a bit dull though. I think that for the
    company you're design for a more personal/open look would work better.

  body: Something about the curves of P and R that don't match the "webhoster". Looks
    more like an e-commerce shopping card provider or an accounting service. Some
    business that is naturally boring trying to look modern and more interesting than
    it is. I can't really quantify it though, just a subjective impression.
