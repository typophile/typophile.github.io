  friendly interior design company called eden. The owner is really fond of the idea
  of having a tree sprout from the ascender of the d and it's roots from the counter
  space.\r\n\r\nSince the overall concept is pretty simple I thought a sans-serif
  font would be most appropriate for the company. \r\n\r\nI've been in search for
  the perfect font and I am in need of some assistance. Since the companies name is
  in all lowercase I was thinking of customizing avenir (35 light) or going with a
  font similar to helevetica neue. \r\n\r\nDo you all have any ideas of what may work?\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!"

    are going to be so many of these logos in the next logo lounge trends report.
    Roots and leaves are the new swoosh.\r\n\r\nAnyway, does the group tend to stick
    with any particular style of interior design? Because that could have a pretty
    big impact on what font to pick. And is this a firm that does homes, businesses,
    or both?"
