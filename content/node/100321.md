body: "Hi All!\r\n\r\nWhile working on a typeface in Illustrator CS6, I came across
  an aliasing issue, that I'm not sure what to do about. I've attached a screen cap
  of two different \"n\"s worked on in different occasions, (same system, same software)
  there was another post regarding aliasing in illustrator on this forum but it wasn't
  this particular problem. I tried saving the file in a legacy format and pasting
  them back in, but I really am just shooting in the dark...\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ill_aliasing_4896.jpg]"

    a while it's all I can see :S specially when comparing forms for discrepancies,
    any suggestions?

    can only look identical on your screen unless they would accidentally fall exactly
    the same way on your personal pixel grid in the current zoom settings. "

    body: Oh they aren't the same shapes at all, they're very different forms done
      at different widths the biggest give away is the differing serifs.

  body: Just for those who experienced this as well I found out that it was two overlapping
    compound shapes, the same form was duplicated on top of its' clone and it was
    held together somehow in one compound object, illustrator couldn't decipher the
    two from one another, but as soon as I pasted the form into fontlab, I was able
    to remove the duplicate that was causing those issues, god bless fontlab, I think
    I'll just try to work in fontlab from beginning to end. yay!
