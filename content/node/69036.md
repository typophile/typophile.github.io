  available at Myfonts.com. \r\n\r\n750 glyphs...\r\nThanks again to those who helped
  me with foreign characters and even naming the font.\r\n\r\nRL[img:sites/default/files/old-images/estonia-nouveau-gallery_4202.png]\r\n\r\nThere
  are other images of the font in the Villu Toots threads... so I won't post them
  here.\r\n\r\nRL"

  body: "I'm getting dizzy just looking at all those spinning flourishes!\r\nWhat
    is that in the E, a triple Salchow?\r\n\r\nNice. The quality of fine calligraphy
    is beautifully captured; it doesn't look \"false\" like so many script fonts,
    or stilted, which is the downfall of too \"correct\" formalism.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know how much of the balance it strikes is due to the distressing. Are you considering
    a smooth version? That would be the acid test."

    While it CAN be done, I'm not sure I have the energy to smoothen it up ... 750
    glyphs and literally hundreds of nodes per glyph. Let's see how popular it is
    before I consider it.\r\n\r\nAnd that's a triple lutz... geeeze what a rookie
    comment.\r\n\r\n:)"
