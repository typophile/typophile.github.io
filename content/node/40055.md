  forms with the external information.  IS this a typeface or is it just the general
  way the machine renders the information?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/die_3647.jpg]"

  body: Most likely something internal to the equipment, much like a register receipt.
    Although there are numerous fonts that mimic this type.

    it.

  body: I fear this is something you'll have to design yourself. Any similar typeface
    that we might suggest will probably be quite different in specific characters.
    It'll never be what you want and you'll have to end up customizing it in such
    a way that creating it from scratch is a much faster and more cost-effective solution.
    As it is a very strict constructed and geometric face this shouldn't be so hard.
