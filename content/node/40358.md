    a writer with one or more of the big papers \u2013 so I\u2019m 95% certain John
    is his dad. But I could be wrong. I'm not much of a cyber stalker I'm afraid. "

    reports that Andy attended Walt Whitman High School, but not which high school
    :-), but given the location of the NIH it's likely the one in Bethesda, Maryland
    - where according to this bio http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/authors/64/2341/index.html
    John and his family live. Now how can I fit in Kevin Bacon? \r\n"

  body: "The last time I heard from Andy he was going back to school.\r\n\r\nI think
    he was involved somewhat with the letterpress configuration of the proprietary
    face for Arion Press, and I think he mentioned some involvement with the Yale
    Carter typeface. \r\n\r\nBut those are a couple/few years back already. And I'm
    not sure if he was involved or not or whatever happened to him.\r\n\r\nBut in
    his short period of influence he changed us all. When grunge/post-modernism/de-constructionism/etc
    ruled the roost he brought us back common-sensically to the nuts and bolts of
    typography. We owe him a great debt.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    for some project at the Arion Press a couple years back. I tried contacting him
    several months ago using updated info I got from Chuck Creesy at Princeton University
    Press. But I received no reply from Andy. Last I heard, he was living in Bethesda,
    working for a publisher of some sort, I believe. \r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "Lines & Splines was one of the first type-related website I was aware of.
    Definitely the first type-related blog. (An earlier incarnation of David Earl's
    Typographer.org was around then, too, but I didn't know about it yet.) My recollection
    is that Typophile and Typographica appeared as Lines & Splines disappeared.\r\n\r\nHere
    is what it looked like in February 2001:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/linesandsplines2001_6231.gif]\r\n\r\n(I
    did this screen cap when Andy posted a link to an article I had just posted on
    my site, which is also how I found out about Lines & Splines. It was the first
    I'd heard of Joe Clark, too. Hi, Joe!)"

  body: "Hey all, I just got here from a Google search.  I used to know Andy in middle
    school and for a year in high school before I was kicked out.  Here's what I know:\r\n\r\n1.
    \ He was sort of a spaz in middle school.  (not that I had a better reputation)
    \ He was sort of an over-active, pull girls' pigtails, don't-quite-fit-in type.
    \ When I found Lines & Splines I was amazed at how mature and brilliant his writing
    was compared to how I remembered him acting in person most of the time.\r\n\r\n2.
    \ He grew up in Bethesda, MD.\r\n\r\n3.  He and I were in a group of probably
    less than 10 people on BBSes in Pyle Middle school in 1991.  I remember asking
    him if he had a \"Focke's List\" for that month and when he realized I was a BBSer,
    he got really serious and intense.  He asked if I was on any \"elite BBSes\" but
    I didn't yet know what those were.  I lamely replied that I was an The Elite Few,
    which was a policy/politics debate BBS in Washington DC.  It was like being asked
    your favorite action movie and saying \"I only watch PBS.\"  He was not impressed,
    but later I think we shared some BBS numbers with each other.  It was strange
    seeing him talk about computers because he went from low on the totem pole socially
    to having a commanding presence. He wasn't a spaz when he talked about computers.\r\n\r\n4.
    \ When Lines and Splines became the most respected blog on the planet (I remember
    thinking he was late to the game but it just didn't matter because he was so amazing)
    I wrote him an email telling him we went to middle school together.  He wrote
    right back.  When I explained who I was, he stopped writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't
    expect to see him make his presence known in the same way again.  Maybe he'll
    write a book.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
