  Hollywood perfume Michael Kors basically for the packaging and the font. Gold foil
  matched with flamingo pink and a beautiful font...I couldn't put it down. Luckily
  it smells good too. \r\n\r\nI've been scouring the internet trying to find this
  font and I'm not having any luck. Can anyone tell me what the font for \"Very Hollywood\"
  is? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLauren\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VeryHollywood_3966.jpg]"
