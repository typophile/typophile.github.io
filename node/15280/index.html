  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have spent a lot of times reading the other threads in this forum, and I must say that I am slightly ashamed of posting a logo of such inferior quality&hellip; but you have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>I am creating a logo for our company, b10 solutions inc. The company will provide consulting services in bioinformatics (computer science applied to biology). I wanted the logo to be simple and to show a mix of both fields, so I constructed the word &ldquo;bio&rdquo; (biology) out of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s (computers). It&rsquo;s not really original, but I find it better than using a double helix to represent biology (examples of double helixes on top of my head: <a href="http://www.idtdna.com/images/home/home_pic_logo.gif">IDT</a>, <a href="http://www.genomecanada.ca/GCimages/navigation/logo.jpg">Genome Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.sanbi.ac.za/GenomeAfrica/Sanbi_logo1.gif">Sanbi</a>, <a href="http://www.stratagene.com/templates/images/logo1.gif">Stratagene</a>, <a href="http://www.beckmancoulter.com/images/home_img/top_banner_logo.gif">Beckman</a>, <a href="http://www.invitrogen.com/imgLibrary/home_ivgn_logo.gif">Invitrogen</a>, <a href="http://www.vwrsp.com/globalimages/vwr_intl_logo.gif">VWR</a> and <a href="http://www.biocan.com/images/nav/BioTop_1.jpg">Bio Can</a>).</p>
<p>As you will probably notice instantly when looking at the attached logo, I have no formation whatsoever in graphic design (only an interest). We unfortunately cannot afford to pay for a graphic designer at this time. We definitedly will one day.</p>
<p>Of course, I will be really thankful of any comment or critique I get concerning the logo, but I am particularly interested to find out about basic or technical errors I made. Things that anyone with some education in graphic design will spot right away.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

I would also question the name &ldquo;bio&rdquo; it may already taken and copywrited. I also feel in general if the mark can&rsquo;t be read in black and white its not strong enough. Stick with a simple type treatment that can easily be read and do your marketing with either a tag line or accompaning copy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bird,
When you pronounce the name of the company do you call it &ldquo;bee ten&rdquo; or &ldquo;bee one zero&rdquo;, or should it be bilingual? Should it include &ldquo;solutions inc&rdquo; in the title, in which case it would be a mistake to leave that out when considering the logo design. The suggestion Jan made of separating by using colour would result in the b being treated as a separate element in the pronunciation, you could also use a zero with a diagonal crossbar to make it clear that it is a numeral, and by extension the character next to it is also (because it has the same height and colour). The b needs some attention try making the ascender lead into the counter like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=pump">Pump</a>, not necessarily with the open counter, just the junction of the two elements at the base and keeping the echo of the 1 in the curve at the top. A point about printing orange, like purple it is difficult to get it to print satisfactorily using 4 colour process.</p>
<p>ChrisG,
At the moment, since the redesign, it is not possible to upload images unless you are the creator of a thread, when you can add them to the initial post. You might also want to read this <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14424">thread</a>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Bird,
My question related to how you space the characters, to see if it was possible to infer the pronounciation from their appearance. A customer, seeing your company name might presume bee-ten, it might be worth your while practising with the spacing to see if you can produce the correct pronounciation.
The problems with reproducing orange are due to the limited colours that yellow and magenta can produce, generally they reproduce as a brown. Your printer should be able to tell you what he would prefer, but I would go for something like 100% yellow and 50-60% magenta. The effects will also be influenced by the type of stock you are printing on.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have attached to my initial post the design idea from Chris G. Also, I slightly modified it and attached the result. I find the modified one more consistent, but I still don&rsquo;t know which I prefer it.</p>
<p>The modified design uses 100% yellow / 50% magenta according to photoshop&rsquo;s CMYK model. On my home monitor, it produces a satisfactory color. How much will that change on real paper with real ink, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have tried to play with the spacing, and I agree with what Chris G said to me by email: &ldquo;I think this does not necessarily make the matter any clearer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Chris G asked if it would be possible to use &ldquo;B 1 ZERO&rdquo; to communicate the pronunciation of the name (&ldquo;zero&rdquo; is &ldquo;zéro&rdquo; in french, but &ldquo;one&rdquo; is &ldquo;un&rdquo;). Technically, yes, but I dislike the inconsistency it would bring (why have &ldquo;1&rdquo; written as &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&rdquo; as &ldquo;ZERO&rdquo;?).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">That junction of stem and bowl on the b makes a dark spot in your new design. The same x-height removes the b-one-zero reading and returns it to bio. The binary look you were trying to employ overwhelms the logo in your new designs.
The strapline is not positioned well under the logotype, it appears to overhang to the right (because of the curve of the 0); it is also a bit light for use in all applications, a business card for example, the tracking/kerning is too loose, especially apparent in the INC, you should be aiming for even optical spaces when kerning, a method for checking kerning is to print it out and view it upsidedown with half closed eyes, the light areas should appear similar in size. 
As a final point it is more useful to create your logos in a vector drawing program (like Adobe Illustrator or Freehand) because that will allow you to enlarge the logo without worrying about resolution and the file size will be smaller, it will also be easier to create 4 colour, spot colour and rgb versions. If you continue with Photoshop, for most print uses you will need to have the logo at least at 300dpi at the size you intend to use it.
