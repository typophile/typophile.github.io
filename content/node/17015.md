    Caslon Italic</a> is a beaut and because it's upright and not slanted I tend to
    use it with Roman text as well.\r\n\r\nActually all the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caslon-3-caslon-540/caslonfiveforty-medium/charmap.html\">Caslon
    italics</a> seem to have variations on that ampersand.\r\n\r\nFor the record I
    hate the shape of the Galliard ampersand in that other thread, Today sans uses
    a similar shape and I end up substituting another font for just that character."

  body: "jonathan, i hope you're ok with me using this thread for another question:\r\nfor
    a modern, humanistic sans (some would probably say its inspired by dax) im working
    on the & at the moment. the one i have right now is a Et-ligature.. i mean changed
    an all, but its inspired by the Et-connection and not by the classic & that evolved
    through time.\r\ndo you know other fonts that use this as the only ampersand?
    or would you only give this to the user as a alternative gylph?"

    a more "normal" style.'

  body: When you say the Et ampersand do you mean the one that looks like a backwards
    3 with a flourish or the awful one that looks like a lowercase et?

    about the bad image and the stuff in front of the gylph i want to show, but its
    the best i can find right now)"
