body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been looking around the web for information about
  transparent business cards, so I figured I&#39;d ask here. <BR> <BR>Here is my proposed
  design for the business card. I think I want it on transparent acetate or similar.
  The areas in white will be clear. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate any comments on the
  card design, and tips/warnings from anyone who has printed on clear or semi-transparent
  media before. <BR> <BR>Many thanks for any assistance rendered! <BR> <BR>-Mike <BR>

  body: 'It&#39;s too busy and the information hierarchy is not clear. It is obvious
    that the logo is the first read, and the name is a clear second, but the rest
    of the information seems a little confusing. Suggestions: <BR> <BR>1 Decrease
    the size of &#34;Communications Consultant&#34; unless the title is more important
    than the actual contact information. <BR> <BR>2 Either lose the gray band or find
    a way to create more space between the enclosed type and the edges of the gray
    band'

  body: 'Mike, <BR> <BR>I like the design in general. <BR> <BR>I agree with Scott&#39;s
    &#40;as always&#41; well made points. I also would like to suggest a couple of
    things: <BR> <BR>1. The cross-alignment of your name, title, and email on the
    left with the other contact info on the right needs a little attention. You might
    try aligning the top of your phone number with the top of your name and the bottom
    line &#40;your web address&#41; with the bottom of your email and then split the
    remainder with the lines in between. Losing the quote is good advice and would
    help you give breathing space. <BR> <BR>2. If contact info is on the right then
    shouldn&#39;t email be grouped there too? Did you try that? <BR> <BR>3. The parentheses
    around the area code of your phone number make the line appear indented, you might
    want to nudge it to the left. Trust your eyes after your grid is defined. <BR>
    <BR>4. Any reason for the dotless &#39;i&#39;s? I only ask because I noticed it
    not because I have any crit of it. <BR> <BR>5. You might try reducing the size
    of your logo and separate it with more white space. This will set it off more
    and reducing the size of your title will help too. Further to this &#40;and further
    to my point 2.&#41; I would reduce the size of all the contact info and put the
    email on the right. If you want to make it primary put it first. You could try
    bolding it too. You&#39;d have to see. <BR> <BR>Roughly then the card becaomes
    four quadrants &#40;though not necessarily strictly delineated&#41;: <BR>Upper
    left: logo <BR>Upper right: whitespace <BR>Lower-left: name and title <BR>lower
    right: contact and location <BR> <BR>I&#39;d better stop now. I haven&#39;t been
    around for a bit and I&#39;m going to overfunction. Hang in there! Keep us posted.

  body: 'Hello again, <BR> <BR>Scott and Jon: thank you very much for your critiques.
    I really appreciate the assistance you both provided! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve drafted
    up a new proof of the business card. The top graphic shows how the grid is laid
    out, and the second graphic is the card without the guides. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49550.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve tweaked font spacing, layout, and sizes. I think I&#39;m
    much happier with how the card looks now. <BR> <BR>Jon, regarding the email address:
    when I put it in the column with the other contact info, the card became so off-balanced
    that it didn&#39;t look right. As well, my email address is how I do the majority
    of communications, so I like how it&#39;s &#34;front-and-centre&#34; compared
    to the other address elements. As per your suggestion I also scaled down the logo
    size, and I prefer how this looks. <BR> <BR>Scott, I left the grey bar in &#40;but
    I increased the total size of it&#41; since it really looks empty and unfocused
    without it. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your tips on the printing type. I am going to
    use Pantone Metallic 8183 C on the logo, and will be printing it on one of these
    stocks: &#40;still waiting to hear back from my printer&#41; <BR> <BR>CTI Paper
    USA - Glama Natural Clear 48 lb. <BR>Reich Paper - Clear #48 <BR>Gilbert - Gilclear
    Fineline Heavy &#40;this one has very faint lines watermarked into the paper.
    I&#39;m still debating if I&#39;ll use it, or if I&#39;ll go with the plain translucents
    above&#41; <BR> <BR>I am really excited about how this is shaping up, though more
    comments on this new draft are greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>-Mike'

  body: Mike, <BR> <BR>Looking good.  I might think about loosing the paranthesis
    on the area code.  That way your alignment will look stronger. <BR> <BR>One printing
    idea.  The cool thing about transparant printing is how you can print things on
    the back and they show through.  So perhaps you can print that gray bar on the
    back of your card. <BR> <BR>Might be nice.

  body: Mike, <BR> <BR>Looking good. I think the balance is a lot better, and I like
    the logo&#39;s size and alignment way better now too.  <BR> <BR>I think Peter
    has a really neat idea with the printing the grey bar on the back idea. That would
    be very cool. What about bleeding it off the bottom? <BR> <BR><i>&#40;this one

    these lines symetrical, sequential or anything? It would be cool if they were
    but if not I&#39;d avoid it and go with one of the others. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: 'Hello again, everyone! <BR> <BR>I briefly considered swapping the parenthesis
    with square brackets, but taking the punctuation marks out altogether might work
    too. Here&#39;s how it would look: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49657.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I think I personally prefer the version without the brackets,
    but please let me know what you think. <BR> <BR>I like your idea about printing
    the bar on the back of the card. The paper is quite translucent, but a really
    dark bar on the back might look good. I&#39;m going to raise this with my printer
    and get their opinion on this. <BR> <BR>As for the paper with the lines, I decided
    to dump it late last night. Even though these lines were evenly spaced and looked
    nice on their own, I have a feeling they would only conflict with the simplicity
    of the card and add unnecessary clutter. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your comments

  body: Printing on plastic is expensive, and it takes forever to dry. I did a project
    on Lupo, and the printer said he would double the price if we ever reprinted.
    There was also a lot of waste because he smeared so easily. <BR> <BR>The design
    is coming along nicely.

  body: Printing on plastic is like sending square direct mail pieces they look nice
    but cost twice as much. Ask yourself this question will that plastic card get
    you one more new client. You might look at a 90 white coated cover stock. It would
    make your graphics and type pop.

  body: Looks like offset on GillClear or Glamma - not a real difficult print job
    - ask your printer to use hard dry ink and it will dry much faster. Cindy - did
    you mean Yupo? I have done menus on Yupo that didn&#39;t have any problem - although
    like with Gill Clear or Glamma you should request hard dry &#40;sometimes called
    fast dry&#41; inks. Also make sure they are using an oil based ink with enough
    drying agent. I asked a press op what he does to keep synthetic stock from smearing
    and he said not to run it too heavy, and to use the right ink - not just what
    your printer has on the shelf.
