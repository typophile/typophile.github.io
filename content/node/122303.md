  in an old desk. They didn't know what it was but liked the text so framed it and
  put it on their wall. There are Hebrew characters in the text but some other non-Hebrew
  characters as well as a seal. Can anyone tell what the scripts are and what the
  text says? The text is one long string followed by the seal so I took a photo of
  the entire text. You'll need to zoom in on the text in order to read it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/odd-text_3948.jpg]\r\n\r\nSince
  the image is wider than the supported size, I've also attached the image as a file
  attachment.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nZev"
