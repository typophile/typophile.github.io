  was a great book recommended to me by a grad student in graphic design at RISD.
  I read through it in 2 days and thought it was a great introduction to type and
  all of its aspects while still valuable for professionals in the field. As it so
  clearly states in its first lines, it is not a book about fonts but how and when
  to use them. The book is divided into three sections. The first section describes
  letters - the history, the anatomy, and the look. The second section details \"text\"
  - layout design, white space, narrative vs nonlinearity, etc. Lastly, the third
  section outlines the infamous \"grid.\" Ella Lupton combines just the right amount
  of witty humor with her clear expertise with makes this textbook, essential, very
  readable and enjoyable.<br>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Do you own this book? Add your review!</i></b>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td

  the assumptions and process of our predecessors in a way that challenges our thinking

  Berkson</a>:</strong>\r\nFew books deserve the name 'great', but this is one. The
  author brings a combination of eloquence, learning, and passion for excellence,
  and the result is a stunning achievement. This work seems to be at the top of everyone's
  lists of books in typography.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the book's
  greatest strengths is also a weakness, though. Bringhurst has the classical taste
  in art - a taste that treasures the rare combination of serenity and elation, and
  the works of art that give us this feeling.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following
  this taste, he perceptively separates out the Romantic elements that we have come
  to accept as normal, such as bold fonts, grotesque style sans, wide pages, and the
  em dash. And he revives and highlights the classical views of proportion and design
  in typography.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this provides a powerful
  new standard of excellence for book typography - and books are really Bringhurst's
  focus.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weakness of this book is that the Romantic
  taste does indeed have its place, and this taste is neglected. Not only advertising,
  but also any short material is often best served by typography that is not serene,
  but rather provocative. What would quickly become tiresome in a book can be delightful
  in smaller doses, and a different context.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share
  Bringhurst's classical tastes, so to me the neglect of advertising and the Romantic
  side of typography is no big loss. The Romantic taste is to be found everywhere
  else, so this book is a rare treasure: an exploration of the classical taste in
  an art that affects everyone.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Do you own this book? Add your review!</i></b>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td

  It!\r\n\r\n</a></b>\r\n<strong>Review by Paulus:</strong>\r\nI bought this book
  because I was working on a CID and although I think we are currently moving away
  from these 'Single-Logo' branding ideas, this book was really resourceful and helped
  a lot to get my head around the subject. A good buy for any sound graphic design
  library.\r\n\r\n<strong>Reviewed by P. Shecter R.G.D. </strong>\r\nPer Mollerup
  [from the cover] has created a fantastic volume on trademarks, wordmarks and logos.
  If you own the Elements of Typographic Style, then this book should sit right next
  to it on your book shelf. Mollerup includes a comprehensive taxonomy on logotypes
  and logograms. There are some great tidbits on the creation of different marks.
  And he discusses how culture plays a key role in the adaption of marks world wide.
  \r\n\r\n<strong>Reviewed by Margaret McCullough:</strong>\r\nThis book is not only
  a visual treat for the eyes but also brain food for the creative intellect. I originally
  purchased this book as an accompaniment to a course I took on the history of mark
  making. Unlike many books bought for academic use, this one has remained above my
  desk, significant for a book designer. It takes the reader through the origin and
  evolution of trademarks as well as some lovely tidbits about their creation and
  individual transformations over the years. Any dryness in the copy is more than
  made up for by this books elegance and format. A must have for any designer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Reviewed
  by DesignMaven:</strong>\r\nThe great feature of this book [is that] it discusses
  Semiotics and Semantics which are Essential and Integral in the Best Identities.
  e.g. SAUL BASS, PAUL RAND, LESTER BEALL, DON ERVIN, and the first 30 years of Lippincott
  & Margulies; Landor and Siegel & Gale. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
  current in the Seminal works of Pentagram and BrandEquity International (others).
  Unfortunatetly, Semiotics and Semantics are overlooked in the today's Identity Projects.
  Not taught in today's classroom.\t\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another strength
  of this book. It strives to accurately Identify the Original Creators of the Identity
  Design. If this book has a weakness. It is because it was not continued as a series.<br>\r\n<b><i>Do

  fascinates me most about typography is the sheer amount of meaning contained in
  a typeface. A quantum hologram, the more you look the more you find.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
  one has looked harder than Chris Burke, here. This is a heavy-duty piece of scholarship
  written by a type designer. And what a story, putting type design at the centre
  of world events and contextualizing it with respect to everything: the designer's
  personal life, his design work and teaching, technology, politics, culture, business,
  and so on. All the details of Renner's life illuminate Futura, including those that
  happened many years after he designed it.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a
  type designer, I found reading this to be very empowering, giving great relevance
