		<div class="commentbody"><p>That&rsquo;s bizarre. Especially since Christmas is all over the place. It&rsquo;s like this debate over the &lsquo;War&rsquo; has gotten everyone to think that this is a bigger issue than it is.</p>
<p>On a related note, the House of Representatives <a href="http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/thedebate/2005/12/war_on_christma.html">passed a bill to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; Christmas</a>. The ensuing debate is pretty funny and pretty indicative of how ludicrous it is for the U.S. government to pass bills to protect a specific religion.</p>
<p>Wish people a Merry Christmas! Who cares!? Focus on something that <em>matters</em>, like any of the laundry list of problems in this country, let alone the world. Christmas isn&rsquo;t suffering because of &ldquo;secular&rdquo; activities, it&rsquo;s suffering because its practitioners are missing the point. Heck, even <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/06/churches.closed.christmas.ap/index.html">megachurches</a> are closing on Christmas because of anticipated low turnout due to Christmas falling on Sunday. Who would have guessed that churches themselves would be fighting the war against &ldquo;the reason behind the season&rdquo;? Even Fox had &lsquo;Happy Holidays&rsquo; ornaments for sale on its site before this B.S. crusade started.</p>
<p>As was pointed out by Rep. Gary Ackerman: &ldquo;Is this another war we fight for reasons that do not exist?&rdquo; This is not a war against Christmas, it&rsquo;s the plurality of the United States expressing itself through the democracy of the governing institutions. Welcome to freedom, people. It&rsquo;s not that you can&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas, it&rsquo;s that there are other celebrations going on and people want to acknowledge them. Christians are the overwhelming majority in the U.S. Self-centered individuals are trying to set up the majority as the minority to curry support and money from them. It&rsquo;s a con, and an old one.</p>

They would love to get everyone all up in arms about &ldquo;saving Christmas&rdquo; so that they forget about the war and the torture chambers and the unrepresented prisoners in Guantanamo.

<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;war on Christmas&rdquo; (please can we stop the &ldquo;war on&hellip;&rdquo; rhetoric in the new year?) but there are definitely people in public institutions (schools, local municipalities) who have been duped by the ACLU into thinking that the C word will get them fired or at the wrong end of a lawsuit. The ACLU is mired in double-speak like every other political organization (and the news organizations)&hellip; They&rsquo;re not out to make room for other religions in schools, they&rsquo;re just trying to get Christianity out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Marc, I&rsquo;m referring to how people (in schools mostly) are sanitizing Christmas out of their &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; activities by removing religous symbols and words from songs because they <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s forbidden by the law. The law simply states that Christmas displays must have both a secular and a religous reference (an angel and a snow man or a santa, for example). And that programs involving singing should include multiple religions (hannukkah for example) and/or have secular songs in the mix (jingle bells).</p>
<p>Given the lawsuits about the pledge this year and over prayer in schools in past years it&rsquo;s no wonder public officials at local levels are scared and may not understand their rights.</p>

They are all over individual citizens excercising free speech. &lsquo;Protecting&rsquo; other peoples rights. Telling 6 year olds they can&rsquo;t use the word &lsquo;Jesus&rsquo; in &lsquo;holiday&rsquo; decorations. I think it&rsquo;s funny we&rsquo;re all about not offending people, but in the process are offending another large faction of the United States, but it doesn&rsquo;t count, because we&rsquo;re &lsquo;hipocrites&rsquo; and &lsquo;bigots&rsquo; using our evil to save babies and such. George W. Bush doesn&rsquo;t speak for the Christian right. He may court it, but I&rsquo;ve counted him out as a dangerous traitor, even more dangerous than John Kerry, because at least with Kerry we knew he&rsquo;s a socialist, and with W, he just stinks like a weasel.</p>

<p>I find it fitting that we all share the season in our own way and celebrate in a way we deem appropriate. I hope we all have a wonderful time celebrating with our family and loved ones. I hope we all can keep those not near to us in our hearts, just as I keep you in mine.</p>

<p>Well said! Where would our economy be without an annual gift-giving day?</p>
<p>I heard a lawyer on the radio the other day say that it is within the prerogative of local governments to set up [insert-favorite-holiday-name-here] decoration in the public space, because it is permissible for local governments to encourage an increase in local consumer spending—which leads to higher tax revenues. [This, at least in theory, is good for everybody. Now how far apart from the true meaning of Christmas is that <em>really</em> ;-) ]</p>
<p>I will also be celebrating &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; this year (well, <em>Weihnachten</em>, actually…), but my Christmas cards say &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; on them, too. I may believe in my beliefs, but I certainly don&rsquo;t want to offend anyone with them. That&rsquo;s my beef with the Christian Right, I guess… and probably most other <em>&ldquo;listen to us, we are &lsquo;right&rsquo;s&rsquo;,&rdquo; too!</em> How are you ever going to convince someone that you are right when you starting right off by offending them? That isn&rsquo;t real conservatism. Real conservatism (and real Republican-ism, I thought) is minding your own business, and expecting everyone else to mind theirs as well.</p>

<p>You hit the definition on the head for Republicanism. Not conservatism.</p>
<p>Republicans viewed as conservatives is what causes confusion. Being a republican and being conservative are two different things.  I know quite a few Republicans the hate religion as much as the next guy, and share in very few of my beliefs. Politicians ( Dubya ) playing to the right doesn&rsquo;t help anyone.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s about two different things.  People that hold signs out that say &lsquo;God hates fags&rsquo; is not conservative, nor Christian, they are likely a republican that doesn&rsquo;t know the distinction between the two, who grew up going to church, but doesn&rsquo;t mean much to them, or hey, I&rsquo;m white, I must be Christian. That is real bigotry.</p>
<p>There are many things about Republicanism that make me sick. Unfortunately there is more about liberal democracy that make me more ill.</p>
<p>I mean, I see American culture. I see the seperation of church and state distorted out of it&rsquo;s meaning. This thing called founders intent clarifies the first amendment</p>
<p>&quot; &hellip;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>was intended to prevent the formation of a &lsquo;state church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If it was simply about preventing the formation of a &lsquo;state church&rsquo;  and not eliminating Christianity from the public square, why is there such a fight now? The people of this country are having there ability to even see two different sides taken away.</p>
<p>In attending a public university, I witness the hostility towards Christianity nearly every day, in one form or another. The humanists OWN public education. What a convenient way of eliminating competition, than distorting an amendment to your own use? Take a look at the founding of public education in America. Educational Founding father John Dewey wrote lengthy texts on social engineering. The system in place is deviously brilliant.</p>

<p>Well I was offended that a fellow Catholic sent me this lame &lsquo;happy holidays&rsquo; card.</p>
<p>But seriously, Dan, who do you think you would offend by simply saying Merry Christmas, other than people who actually hate your faith in all its aspects and would destroy it if they could? Okay, so I wouldn&rsquo;t send a Christmas card with an image of the nativity and a message inside saying that the recipient would be prayed for in a Christmas novena of Masses offered by priests of the Fraternity of St Peter to someone whom I knew to be Jewish or Muslim etc. Because that probably would offend. But I&rsquo;ve never known a religious person in our societies (Europe and North America) to be offended by the open and joyful celebration of major feasts of other religions. Indeed, there seems to be a sense of solidarity among religious people of many faiths against the secularisation of society and atheist agendas. [As an example that doesn&rsquo;t have to do with holidays, when radical feminists descrated the cathedral in Montreal a few years ago, scrawling on walls and altars with used tampons, the quickest condemnation came from B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith; actually, they were pretty much the only non-Catholic organisation to speak out, the secular civil rights organisations were totally silent.] Ironically, plenty of non-Christians have wished me a merry Christmas at this time of year because they know it is a major feast for my religion, and if I know someone is Jewish and it is close to e.g. Rosh Hashana, I&rsquo;ll wish that person a happy new year <em>because I understand that this is an important day for him or her.</em> This, it seems to me, is the way to live in a multifaith society: to recognise the importance to people of faith of their holy days and traditions, to celebrate ones own in an open and generous way, and to respect those of others. The idea that you will offend people of other faiths by expressing your own is an atheist and secularist ploy: it has nothing to do with a genuinely multifaith society, and everything to do with creating a society without faith.</p>

<p>John,
The world is not made up of ONLY religious persons and most people who are not religious have NO desire to destroy your faith. Most of us are quite happy to have you and everyone else go about their lives believing as they please. I am not a religious person although I was brought up to be. I don&rsquo;t mind people saying Merry Christmas to me and I say it to them as well. I also would be happy if kids were allowed to celebrate Halloween in schools again but some religious extremists have had it banned because they think it is an anti-religious celebration instead of just kids having fun.
People, be they religious or not, need to practice tolerance of others and their differences. People need to love thy neighbor as thine self and ask not what their faith may or may not be. There is a vast difference between not promoting any religion and trying to destroy religion.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas to you and may your family be close to you always,</p>
<p>ChrisL</p>

I very much enjoyed your Happy Holidays card. I felt it was your and your girl friend&rsquo;s sincere personal expression of good wishes for the season whatever your faith or my faith may or may not be. At least for a while longer, you have the right to free expression and I am proud that you chose to do it your own way. I also find it hypocritical that those claiming to be of Christian faith find it necessary to ridicule your honest and free expression. If Jesus would say, &ldquo;Father, forgive them for they know not what they do&rdquo; while being tortured to death, I am sure he would have taken your holiday card as a kindness and not judged it lame.
&ldquo;Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God forbid they have Jewish friends for whom they want to wish a good holiday, or secular friends who they want to wish a good New Years to as well. Seriously, Christmas is the reason for the season, but its not the only thing going. Christians dominate the last two months of every year in the U.S. and all of the sudden a little plurality is somehow an affront? I guess when you hit maximum saturation, the only direction to go is down and that&rsquo;s probably hard to deal with.</p>
<p>I disagree with the odd &lsquo;scorched earth&rsquo; policy that some people have about not even saying &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo;. Just say it if you want to! It&rsquo;s not wrong to express your own feelings of love and merriment, religious or not. But &ldquo;Happy Holidays&rdquo; is an <em>accomodation</em>, not an <em>attack</em>. It includes Christmas. And now the right scores another point by turning feelings of good will into an insult and dividing even more groups of people just trying to live justly and coexist. Congratulations, you got your Christmas wish.</p>

Is that Armenian? Can you post it in the native script? Better yet, how about a JIF file of it on one of your Armenian fonts?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is at all, but then I also don&rsquo;t think that the whole &lsquo;left behind&rsquo; millenialist nonsense has anything at all to do with Christianity. This portrayal of &lsquo;the rapture&rsquo; was invented in the 19th century by a sectarian minister, is based on a very dodgy interpretation of scripture that is flatly contradicted by other passages, and is completely alien to orthodox Christianity. I don&rsquo;t consider those books any more Christian than <em>The Da Vinci Code.</em></p>

<p>No no no: consumer retail capitalism dominates the last two months of every year in the US. (The other ten months, other forms of capitalism dominate on a rotating basis.) The fact that capitalism and protestantism are largely indistinguishable (one of my historian friends considers them a single phenomenon) shouldn&rsquo;t confuse the matter. :)</p>

<p>Chris, your point about &ldquo;Happy Holidays&rdquo; being an inclusive statement is true, and well taken. It&rsquo;s just that in the context of the push to remove all religion from public life (which in this country looks more like the replacement of Christianity with atheism) it&rsquo;s hard to separate this mention of Christmas from the rest of the anti-religion dialogue. The separation of church and state is to prevent the dangers of a state-sponsored church. The opposite of a state-run church is not the exclusion of any religion &ndash; it&rsquo;s the inclusion of all of them. (Kind of like the *opposite of patriarchy is not matriarchy, but fraternity.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be offended by a &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; greeting&hellip; but I will be offended that I didn&rsquo;t get a card from Dan. =)</p>
<p>John, you took the time to articulate what I was to lazy to attempt&hellip; essentially that the best policy is to know your friends/acquaintences and to wish them whatever is appropriate. That&rsquo;s the sensitive approach that reminds us all that we&rsquo;re unique, that our beliefs are personal and that it&rsquo;s thoughtful to be respectfully acknowledged. This is akin to cultural sensitivity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confused about the definition of bigotry is used here. It seems to differ from that of the one in the dictionary, so&hellip; if a group believes one way, and isn&rsquo;t willing to change, thats bigotry?</p>
<p>I believe a big part of that is &lsquo;intolerance.&rsquo;  Intolerance is Hitler, people who killed Matthew Shepard, because they differ.  Growing up Christian, reaching out to people. Me and my kind, John and I will differ on the distincions Protestant vs. Catholic, wanting to reach out to people is not bigotry. I&rsquo;ve never forced my beliefs on anyone. Thats not the way of anyone I know.If it&rsquo;s mentioned, I&rsquo;ll talk about it. It seems this &lsquo;hate and bigotry&rsquo; mantra is very popular, yet I really don&rsquo;t see the connection, or where it comes from.</p>
<p>Lets say I speak out about something. Someones feelings get hurt. Does that make my statement hateful by default? Because we&rsquo;ve defined morality by emotion alone?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather be a fundamentalist than faithless any day. Every genocidal regime of the 20th century was faithless. Hitler, Stalin, Chairman Mao. Take your pick.</p>

<p>Problem is, biblically, God is the same past present and future, therefore the truth is unchanging. Yes, people skirt around scripture, because they want to go to heaven without the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Joe, when you say &lsquo;public life&rsquo; I think you are being a bit broad brush. Publicly funded life perhaps. To me there is a big big difference. Nobody has to cover their crucifix ( or what have you ) when they go outside. If they did that would be &lsquo;public life&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Still, you may feel that keeping religion out of publicly funded life is too paternalistic. And if so, I acknowledge that you may have a point. A very good one. People aught to know what is right from what is wrong. It seems obvious moral point in favor of cultural life diversity etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand this tendency to keep &lsquo;church&rsquo; out of publicly funded life we have maintained in the good ol' USA means that we are one more step away from Pogroms,  Anti-Catholic, Anti-protestant bombings or the many many other kinds of religously fueled violence that has surged around most of the rest of world. For example Ireland, Israel, India, Indonesia - ( and that&rsquo;s just some of the countries that start with the letter &lsquo;I&rsquo; ) have a seemingly intractable problems with religously fueled violence. The reasons are of course quite complicated; but they definitely have something to do with the fact ( or appearance if you like ) of the national government favoring one religion over another.</p>
<p>Maybe I am selling my fellow man short. It&rsquo;s hard to know. But as far as I can see, the lesson of history is that all it takes is the impression that your group is getting the shaft to create an urge to violence. Especially if your group already has the most money, power, etc and seems to stands to loose the advantage. Keeping religion out of publically funded life seems like a mighty small price to pay for staying as far as possible from turning into anything at all like one of these &lsquo;I&rsquo; countries.</p>
<p>Is that insurance currently bought at too high a price? Maybe. But given humanity&rsquo;s history, and the current crop of pundits gracing our airwaves with their messages of goodwill and tollerance*, I think I&rsquo;ll pay that price and even be happy about doing it.</p>
<p>*I am of course thinking of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly and his poisonous attempt to use Christmas as yet another opportunity to villify and sow discord.</p>

<p>And in every century before that the opposite. And there are other Genocides you have forgotten to pick in the 20th century - they don&rsquo;t all fit either.</p>
<p>Besides The Nazi&rsquo;s had flirted both with Christianity &amp; Catholisism ( which flirted back ), and with their own invented version of Neo-paganism. And they did this all at once. Genocide was possible in the wake of industry  - not a lack of a religous urge.</p>

<p>Both of those things come from A: biblical sources and B: the belief that man is more than an animal. C. that despite what recent law states, the definition of life has not changed.</p>
<p>If everyone was accepted as a Christian, who did anything,who believed opposite, what point would belief in something greater be, when you simply ignore it because &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not nice&rsquo; ? Thats why it exists because it encompasses a set of beliefs that are accepted as truth.</p>
<p>I think more than less, Christians are very tolerant to the strictest interpretation of the word. If I should be compelled, I would be blocking abortion clinics every day. As murder is against the word of God, true Christianity does not condone killing abortion clinic staff.</p>
<p>Eben.</p>
<p>Nazis flirted with Religious systems on a political level to leverage what they wanted. That may have been cowardly on the part of the clergy/church, but Nazis they had their opponents assassinated.</p>
<p>Just for my info, what were the other &lsquo;faith&rsquo;filled regimes you speak of. 
( Please exclude politically hijacked religious systems ala pre-Enlightenment Roman Catholicism )
Actually it&rsquo;s easy to tell when a regime uses it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Power of God&rsquo; and own interpretation to motivate it&rsquo;s citizens and army to do it&rsquo;s bidding. Constantine did it. He saw the power that faith in Jesus Christ held on the people in his kingdom and used it to leverage his military will, his subjects, as with later in the Middle ages, were mostly illiterate, relying on very few for information.</p>
<p>Hrant,
I can admit the habitation of North America was done cruelly and unjustly.
What can be done? Seriously. Should every non-native in the U.S. just pack up and leave for the sins of our fathers?</p>

People have ALWAYS used religion as a way to justify their atrocities.
When we were in Viet Nam (on the side of the Christian Vietnamese) we killed &ldquo;Gooks&rdquo; who were not thought of as people&ndash;how &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; of us.

<p>Come on, all kinds of things. Nothing extreme like packing up - that would be as unreasonable as how this nation was consolidated. Here&rsquo;s a small example of what can be done: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4466096.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4466096.stm</a></p>
<p>At the very least, the US needs to formally admit it was Genocide. The people of America must accept what really happened, talk about it, feel guilty about it, apologize, from the heart. That simple act would inject the humility necessary for a superpower to behave responsibly, instead of merrily pillaging far away lands and feeling good about it too. This humility would also give Americans greater resolve to address other genocides that have been committed, including by its allies*. All this might not be of great practical benefit to the quasi-slave Native Americans on the ground today, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like in Turkey right now:
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4552886.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4552886.stm</a> _
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4531782.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4531782.stm</a> _
Whenever an Armenian Genocide Recognition
bill makes it to the House, it&rsquo;s struck down at the
last minute. This is directly opposed to what I see
as the inherent American affinity for Fairness. But
the American people are never allowed to hear of this&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the teenager has not come to terms with what he did to
his friend in elementary school, he will be a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; citizen;
and the more powerful that teenager is, the more people suffer,
including eventually the teenager himself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry Nick, but I fail to see how being opposed to the killing of human beings in a fetal state is bigoted. Is being opposed to the killing of human beings in an adolescent state bigoted? Presumably being opposed to killing human beings in a geriatric state is bigoted, because the Church is opposed to euthenasia. If being opposed to such killing makes me intolerant, then I wonder what being in favour of it makes you.</p>

<p>I really hate the &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; card. Its just too easy. I don&rsquo;t mean to single you out Eric as that&rsquo;s not my intent. But you really have to look deep at history and not just choose a snippet of time. If you really want to look at the effects of a society governed by religion vs. a society not governed by religion you must analyze ALL of human history. This includes both dates BEFORE and after any documentation of Jesus Christ. There is a long line of human genocide done in the name of religion in societies past as well as what is going on RIGHT NOW in MANY parts of the world. I&rsquo;m not knocking you because I know you&rsquo;re an intelligent guy but many people fail to see the correlation between history and politics. We have enough evidence of human history to document what can potentially happen should path &ldquo;z&rdquo; be chosen, yet we just choose to ignore it.</p>
<p>The ultimate hypocrisy to me is to claim to be a country where all religions can worship freely, yet we demand people to stand and pledge to a flag and a monotheistic deity. In &ldquo;God We trust&rdquo; no, &ldquo;WE&rdquo; don&rsquo;t, but &ldquo;I&rdquo; do because I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>A society with &ldquo;ONE&rdquo; faith is just as dangerous as a society &ldquo;without&rdquo; faith.</p>

<p>That in itself is not. But fundamentalists campaign vigorously to change the law to prevent women from aborting foetuses which are the result of rape, congenitally deformed, or which they will be unable or unwilling to care for as childrren.</p>
<p>On the other hand, pro-arbortionists do not wish to legally compel abortions for women who are pregnant in the same circumstances.</p>
<p>Agressively forcing one&rsquo;s interpretation of one&rsquo;s religion on others is bigoted, especially when one seeks to enforce it in secular law.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh Nick&hellip;how you have so eloquently hit the nail on the head. The problem with not seperating church and state is allowing for legislation to be passed that is inherently &ldquo;bigoted&rdquo;. If one is to take a look at health care costs for women vs. men there is no denying the sexism. The costs alone for women to both visit their OBGYN and to obtain prescription medication is sexist. The viewpoint on &ldquo;birth control&rdquo; and how insurance companies currently handle it is a direct result of how &ldquo;Christian fundamentalism&rdquo; is having an effect within our political system. Not only is it sexist, its racist as there can be a direct effect on population and poverty as proper &ldquo;health care&rdquo; can only be afforded by those above a certain economic level. In urban areas, we know this is primarily Blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p>The Christian right is already controlling our country, let&rsquo;s get real people.</p>

<p>And killing someone is not aggressively forcing one&rsquo;s views on him or her?</p>
<p>Secular law in Nazi Germany said that Jews were not human beings. Secular law in Canada says that foetuses are not human beings. In both cases, biological science and common sense say otherwise.</p>
<p>Rape, congenital disease and deformity*, economic difficulties, etc. are all hard and painful things to deal with. But so is abortion, and most of the women I know who have had abortions regret it very much. And still abortion is marketed &ndash; yes, marketed, by for profit businesses &ndash; as an immediate relief and an easy solution to the inconvenience of life. The unwillingness to care for a child that you also cite is, of course, statistically is by far the biggest reason for abortion: children are inconvenient so we, as a society, kill millions of them every year out of pure selfishness. No, pro-arbortionists do not wish to legally compel abortions, but the pressure exerted on women &ndash; by family, cowardly boyfriends, and by the private abortion industry &ndash; to have abortions is quite extraordinary, and the assumption in many hospitals is now that if any abnormality is diagnosed in the foetus the normal thing to do is to have an abortion. I know this first hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>But what kind of congenital deformities are you talking about? Thousands of children diagnosed with Down Syndrome are aborted, basically because they look &lsquo;abnormal&rsquo; and require more work than healthy children. Of course, being female is also considered a congenitally undesirable condition by many people, and the law &ndash; or, in Canada, the lack of a law &ndash; makes this perfectly legal grounds to kill a child in the womb. So much for abortion being about the rights of women: clearly it is not about the rights of the females being killed.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And note, by the way, that I have not once cited religion in my opposition to abortion. I am not opposed to abortion because the Catholic Church teaches that abortion is wrong. I am opposed to abortion because reason and science agree that human life begins at conception: that a foetus is a human being, and that killing human beings &ndash; especially defenceless and innocent human beings &ndash; is a moral evil. I didn&rsquo;t used to think this way because, like many people in our society, I accepted a prevailing and uncritical view of abortion that does not acknowledge that what is being done is the killing of a human being. The only part religion plays in all this for me is that the Church, in the consistency of her teaching and public witness to the reality of abortion, forced me to look again and wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to avoid or ignore that reality.</p>
<p>Eric cites the fact that opposition to abortion comes from Biblical sources as the first of his criterion for opposing it. This is typically where Catholics and Orthodox differ from protestants: protestants are likely to say that something is wrong because the Bible says it is wrong. Catholics would more likely reverse this construction and say that the Bible says it is wrong because it is wrong, and then cite the reasons according to natural law, philosophy, science, etc. that show why it is wrong. Is this bigoted? To insist that people engage critically with the medical, philosophical, social and moral issues of abortion?</p>
<p>I see a lot more bigotry among active pro-abortionists who ideologically insist on avoiding these issues, supressing discussion, and go to great lengths to prevent women who are considering abortions from confronting the reality of what is going to be done to the distinct human life developing within them (including the psychological reality, which for many women is very far from the instant relief promised by the abortionists). I know women who have had abortions, most of them regret it, and the phrase I hear very often is &lsquo;At the time I didn&rsquo;t know what abortion was&rsquo;. So here is a multimillion dollar industry, and lobby group, encouraging women to have abortions while &lsquo;for their own good&rsquo; shielding them from even the suggestion that what they are doing is killing a human being. There is a line in Michael Winterbottom&rsquo;s film <em>Code 46</em> that brilliantly captures the doublespeak of the abortion industry: &lsquo;There was no baby, there was only a pregnancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now my religion also teaches that stealing is wrong. And perhaps you would claim it bigotry if I were to demand that there be secular laws against larceny <em>on the basis that the Bible says it is wrong.</em> But I make no such demand. There should be laws against theft because it is demonstrably a moral wrong, socially damaging and tending to victimse the weakest and most defenceless people in society. These are the same grounds on which I believe there should be laws against abortion. It is not a position based on &lsquo;one’s interpretation of one’s religion&rsquo;. It is a reasoned argument with political and legal significance, expressed in a democratic society with the aim of rational persuasion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>I raise a glass of wine to your health and happiness</em></p>
<p>And I raise a glass of hypocras to yours, and offer by way of a festive gift to all the recipe I use.</p>
<p>I first drank hypocras at the conclusion of the ATypI gala dinner in Lyon, a renaissance feast based on dishes mentioned in the writings of Rabelais. Later on the same trip, I purchased a bottle at the palace of the popes in Avignon, and I&rsquo;ve been making a couple of batches every Christmas for many years. Highly recommended.</p>
<hr>
<p>Original Recipe</p>
<p>Pur fait ypocras. Troys vnces de canell &amp; iii vnces gyngeuer; spykenard de Spayn, le pays dun denerer; garyngale, clowes gylofre, poeure long, noiey mugadey, mayioyame, cardemonii, de chescun i quarter donce; grayne de paradys, flour de queynel, de chescun dm. vnce.; de tout soit fait powdour &amp;c. (from Curye on Inglysch Vol.IV p.199)</p>
<hr>
<p>Adapted Ingredients</p>
<p>3 litres red wine (I usually use a southern French merlot or syrah)
265g white sugar
1 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon
1 1/8 tbsp ground ginger (I use fresh grated, rather than powder)
1 1/2 tsp ground cloves
1 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
1 1/2 tsp marjoram (fresh if possible)
1 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp ground spikenard, if available
1/2 tsp grated galengale (dried galangal), if available</p>
<p>Adapted Directions</p>
<ol>
<li>Warm the wine until just beginning to steam. Add the sugar and allow to dissolve.</li>
<li>Mix all the spices and herbs together. Stir half this mixture into the wine, then taste and slowly add more until you achieve a flavour you like (you will probably need most or all of the mixture).</li>
<li>Simmer the mixture very gently for about 10 minutes. Strain through a jelly bag (which may take some hours, although we&rsquo;ve found that squeezing the bag to speed things up and then restraining the result in the same way causes no ill effect).</li>
<li>Bottle when cold, then cork securely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>Galangal is used a lot in Thai cooking, so can be obtained from shops supplying Thai restaurants, or by begging at the restaurants themselves. Spikenard may be ordered online or found at herbalists; you want the powder not the oil. Oil of spikenard was used by St Mary Magdelene to anoint Christ&rsquo;s feet, which has nothing to do with hypocras, but is nice to know when smelling this odd and pungeunt stuff.</p>

<p>^Probably the purest religious expression of the thread. Doesn&rsquo;t the bible say god is light?</p>
<p>Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it&rsquo;s all right 
Little darlin' it&rsquo;s been a long cold lonely winter 
Little darlin' it feels like years since it&rsquo;s been here 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it&rsquo;s all right 
Little darlin' the smiles returning to their faces 
Little darlin' it seems like years since it&rsquo;s been here 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it&rsquo;s all right 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes 
Little darlin' I feel the ice is slowly meltin' 
Little darlin' it seems like years since it&rsquo;s been clear 
Here come the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it&rsquo;s all right 
Here come the sun, here comes the sun 
It&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s all right</p>
