  this. Here's who I have so far. <strong>Does this ring any other bells for anyone?</strong>\r\n

    might fit the bill. There\u2019s an essay about it out there somewhere, Stewf
    might have a link, it\u2019s also in <em>Made With FontFont</em>. Neville Brody
    did some great stuff designing type with strips of tape, that\u2019s in <em>Made
    With FontFont</em> as well. And of course, there\u2019s <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100019\">The
    Proteus Project</a>, you should totally interview the big guys about that one."

  body: "Thanks for including me in your research and for all the images/links! Here's
    some others that I've run across (thanks to Lindsay Ballant for some new ones)
    for your use:\r\n\r\nLetterror is sort of the granddaddy of programmatic type
    (though I'm sure someone's going to object to that). Specifically, [[http://www.letterror.com/foundry/beowolf/index.html|Beowolf]]
    has randomized rough edges.\r\nAnd the letterforms for [[http://www.letterror.com/portfolio/twin/index.html|'Twin']]
    are affected by the weather in the Twin Cities.\r\n\r\nAnother older fella ;)
    is [[http://www.pcho.net|Peter Cho]], with [[http://www.typotopo.com/|Typo Topo]]\r\n\r\nYou
    should definitely check out [[http://www.scriptographer.com/Gallery/|Scriptographer's
    Gallery]], featuring the work of [[http://www.jonathanpuckey.com/|Jonathan Puckey]]
    & [[http://www.scratchdisk.com/|J\xFCrg Lehni]]. Eye magazine did a feature about
    it a while back.\r\n\r\nDavid Reinfurt created an interesting feature for the
    design of Yale's architectural 'zine. He asked various designers to take a customized
    version of Hevetica Neue and make a new typeface from it using some form of alteration.
    Two examples of computational results were created by [[http://www.projectprojects.com/#H_HELV_NEUE|Project
    Projects]] & [[http://www.syntheticautomatic.com/activity.html#helvetica|Apirat
    Infahsaeng]].\r\n\r\nFormer classmate Joshua Walton's [[http://babel.conflux.org/|Babel
    type]] generator. [[http://joshua.conflux.org/portfolio/workImages/babel2.jpg|Example
    1]] [[http://joshua.conflux.org/portfolio/workImages/babel3.jpg|Example 2]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ortho-type.it|3d
    type created in Processing]].\r\n\r\nMore processing by [[http://www.caligraft.com|Ricard
    Marxer]].\r\n\r\nStill not so sure about Hudson-Powell's [[http://www.responsivetype.com/|Responsive
    Type]].\r\n\r\nRobotic type in Nikita Pashenkov's [[http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/nik/projects_n.cgi?alphabot&screenshots|Alphabot]]\r\n\r\nagency:collective's
    [[http://www.agencycollective.com/projects.php?view=type&id=container|Container
    Steganography]].\r\n\r\nWhile not typeface work, these German Students have using
    [[http://www.looksgood.de/log/2007/07/27/diploma-posters-indesign-scripting/|scripting
    in InDesign]] to do some new methods of layout.\r\n\r\nThat's what I've got at
    my fingertips, hope it helps!\r\n-- JK\r\n"
