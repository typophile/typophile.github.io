  body: To the right it says "A bespoke typeface for a commercial gallery." Bespoke
    = custom and usually proprietary. As an alternative, you might like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=letter%20gothic">Letter
    Gothic</a>.

  body: I actually just found out myself that it's Storno from Lineto. At first I
    thought it might've been Typ1451 but it didn't have so much characteristic letters
    as Storno.
