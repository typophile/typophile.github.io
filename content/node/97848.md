body: "1. Do you know the origin and date of creation of the <strong>bold</strong>
  style?\r\nI read it was dated XVIth century. I don't know the precise date and who
  used to initiate it?\r\n2. Apart from the creation of <em>italic</em> as a specific
  typeface by Alde Manuce and Francesco Griffo in the very beginning of XVIth century,
  when was <em>italic</em> first used as a way of highlighting a reference or a single
  word inside a paragraph?\r\n\r\nThanks."
