  body: It reminds me of <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB80311001P1"
    target="_blank">Berliner Grotesk</a>, but I know that&#39;s not it.  <BR> <BR>How

  body: thanks for the response Mike. unfortunately I am totally clueless of the age
    of this piece. I suspect it is 5 to 7 years as the clients don&#39;t have the
    original logo in their hands.
