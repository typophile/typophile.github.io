body: "Sorry, yet another novice's business card question.  :)\r\n\r\nLast summer,
  I was leaving my job in Japan, and needed to give various acquaintances some kind
  of 'business' card with my name & email address (it's the done thing in Japan, you
  gotta have a business card!).  I rather hastily put something together, based on
  the fonts I had on my laptop:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcard_per01_5600.png]\r\nI
  don't pretend this is up to graphic design standards, but I hope it doesn't commit
  any truly egregious errors.\r\n\r\nSince I got back I've also found the need to
  hand out personal contact info to people at various receptions, functions, and whatnot.
  \ So now I've been working on ways of improving the design a little.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcard_per02_5635.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  the 'AT' logo an improvement?  I'm worried it's too dark for proper balance (which
  is why I widened the text to try and compensate).  It's a modified tracing of two
  letters from Goudy's original \"Goudy Text\" designs in <em>The Alphabet & Elements
  of Lettering</em>.  (My sister subsequently pointed out that, quite unintentionally,
  it kind of forms all of my initials: AWLT.)\r\n\r\nI'm also working on an actual
  business card for my current freelance consulting work, which I'll post in a followup."

  body: "OK, the actual business card design I'm working on.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcard_pro02_4317.png]\r\n\r\nDoes
    Avant Garde (well, technically URW Gothic) actually work here?  I wouldn't really
    have expected it, but of all the combinations I tried this seemed most convincing.\r\n\r\nI
    previously tried the following; personally I think it's a little too monotonous,
    but it's a possibility.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bcard_pro01_4007.png]\r\n\r\nI
    don't have much of a budget for new fonts at the moment, so I'd prefer to stay
    with widely available ones (or, in a pinch, at least widely usable fonts which
    I could buy for general use as well).  \r\n\r\nI haven't decided where to fit
    in the phone number yet, but probably just above the email."

    like the second darker logo. But I would raise the two san serif lines a little.
    And I would kern the Ta in your name to push the a under the T a little.\r\nRe:
    your second post, these two cards do not say \"technical and up-to-date\" to me. "

    the personal cards, I've raised the sans lines as you suggest; I also changed
    their font to Candara.\r\n\r\nIn the business cards, interesting point.  How do
    you define looking \"technical and up-to-date\"?\r\n\r\nIf there's a message I
    want to send with the latter, it's more like \"intelligent, but tasteful and conservative/restrained\".
    \ I don't want to appear flashy or trendy."

  body: "From reading \"Design for Non-Designers\", I recall that all-centered alignment
    often feels boring.  I'm getting exactly that impression here \u2014 the flush-left
    alignment in your first two images strikes me as more interesting and more confident
    than your last design. In particular, the list of three items with nothing but
    spaces in between feels loose and haphazard. I suspect this is why your previous
    design seemed \"monotonous\" to you.\r\n\r\nI also found the humanist serif font
    in your previous designs a nicer choice than the portly modern you use now.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and lose the drop shadow. IMHO, shadows should only be used to increase contrast
    (e.g. for light writing on dark background). Here, it just makes the text look
    less crisp."

  body: "I do kind of see what you mean.  The humanist font (which is <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/98769\">Mythology</a>,
    by the way) is still used for the subtitles in the new design - I do want to keep
    it somewhere in there.  Using it for everything doesn't seem quite right, though,
    hence the title change to Bulmer.  \r\n\r\nI rather thought the sterility of a
    modern would subtly accentuate the pen-formed quality of the remaining text.  You're
    probably right in that I should experiment with something other than an all-centred
    layout, though.\r\n\r\nI've realized I should also make the email address more
    readable for the benefit of older customers. :)"

    your artwork are:-\r\n\r\n1. Card thickness/colour/texture - Colorplan 540gsm
    is arguably the best option with a choice of 50 shades http://gfsmith.com/paper/colorplan\r\n\r\n2.
    Print process - letterpress or hot foil printing adds so much character to any
    professional  minimalist or contemporary business card  http://www.deeplyimpressed.co.uk/\r\n\r\n-

    other one (goes with my domain name) and tried tweaking the optical balance.  Not

    I had access to letterpress or professional printing I probably would do that
