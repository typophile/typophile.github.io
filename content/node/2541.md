    of course had to be a secret subliminal message saying it&#39;s good to kill Jews
    in New York. I think Apple actually rearranged the font to appease the Anti-Defamation
    League. So I can see why Microsoft, upon finding an actual <b>swastika</b> in
    their software, would excrete masonry.

    Jews are held to a different standard. Apparently they must tolerate everything,

    persecution of the Jews in Germany and then in other European countries, had the
    Jews sworn to push the Germans into the sea? Had the Jews declared that Germany
    had no right to exist? Had the Jews repeatedly launched multiple armies against
    Germany? Had the Jews conducted decades of terrorist campaign against German civilians?

    because often the people who make antisemitic statements have no clue that what
    they are saying belongs to an established anti-Jewish discourse. Your statements
    seemed to me be antisemitic. Criticising the policies and actions of the Israeli
    government is not antisemitism; calling them &#39;Nazis disguised as Jews&#39;
    is. Gagging at the combination of &#39;human rights organisation&#39; with &#39;Jewish&#39;
    looks like an antisemitic reaction whether it is consciously intended as such
    or not. I&#39;m not singling your statements out, Gerald; over on Typographica
    we had Hrant evoking the stock antisemitic international Jewish conspiracy theory
    with his &#39;dark undercurrents of international lobbying&#39;, and his bizarrely
    veiled references to a &#39;party&#39; and &#39;people&#39; with an agenda &#40;whose
    &#39;tool&#39; I apparently am because I disagree with Hrant&#41;; again, I don&#39;t
    think Hrant is necessarily intending to be antisemitic, but he is using terms
    and evoking ideas that belong to that discourse. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; In the sense
    in which the term is clearly and unambiguously understood by pretty much <i>everyone</i>.
    The insistence on the dictionary definition of Semite to negate the use of the
    term antisemitic is itself a well documented strategy of antisemites, who seek
    to deny the unique historical phenomenon of antisemitism in European culture.
    Other forms of European racism -- anti-Black racism for example -- are no less
    ugly and indefensible, but they are of a different character &#40;in large part
    because they have not developed over almost 2000 years and are not so ingrained
    -- so ingrained that even people who do not consider themselves antisemtic hold
    Jews to standards that do not apply to any other peoples&#41;. The term antisemitism
    has been used to describe this phenomenon for a long time: when 19th century racialists
    wrote about &#39;the Semite&#39; they meant a Jew. Individuals may, more accurately,
    be anti-Jewish, but their statements -- and even the statements of people who
    do not consider themselves anti-Jewish -- are likely to belong to a long tradition,
    and that is what we call antisemitism.'

    specific. <BR>........... <BR><i>Is Judaism a race? If you were to say so, most
    Jews would think you were an antisemite!</i> <BR>.......... <BR><i>A Jew is any
    person whose mother was a Jew or any person who has gone through the formal process
    of conversion to Judaism.</i> <BR>......... <BR><i>It is important to note that
    being a Jew has nothing to do with what you believe or what you do. A person born
    to non-Jewish parents who has not undergone the formal process of conversion but
    who believes everything that Orthodox Jews believe and observes every law and
    custom of Judaism is still a non-Jew, even in the eyes of the most liberal movements
    of Judaism, and a person born to a Jewish mother who is an atheist and never practices
    the Jewish religion is still a Jew, even in the eyes of the ultra-Orthodox. In
    this sense, Judaism is more like a nationality than like other religions, and
    being Jewish is like a citizenship. See What Is Judaism?</i> <BR>.....................
    <BR> <BR><i>In the 1980s, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Jews are
    a race, at least for purposes of certain anti-discrimination laws. Their reasoning:
    at the time these laws were passed, people routinely spoke of the &#34;Jewish
    race&#34; or the &#34;Italian race&#34; as well as the &#34;Negro race,&#34; so
    that is what the legislators intended to protect.  <BR> <BR>But many Jews were
    deeply offended by that decision, offended by any hint that Jews could be considered
    a race. The idea of Jews as a race brings to mind nightmarish visions of Nazi
    Germany, where Jews were declared to be not just a race, but an inferior race
    that had to be rounded up into ghettos and exterminated like vermin.  <BR> <BR>But

  body: This whole thing just seems silly and wrong in many ways. How can Microsoft
    believe that by removing the swastika from a typeface that they are doing the
    world any sort of good? It&#39;s just denying a part of the past, one that in
    my opinion should not be forgotten. Probably the next step would be to photoshop
    out any sign of a swastika from their photos in Encarta. I actually read a newspaper
    article a long time ago, where a teacher was demanding that the school board remove
    all photographs of Hitler and especially any photo with a swastika in it as supposedly
    they promote hate crimes. Now, maybe I just had teachers with a different sense
    of the cirriculum, but I remember WWII being explained as a dark time for humanity,
    not a promotion for Nazis. <BR> <BR>In short, as soon as we start to forget or
    wash over things that have happened in the past that we did not like, they are
    bound to happen again. If Microsoft is so worried about people&#39;s reaction
    to the swastika, then why not start an education program on what the swastika
    means and why it should not be forgotten instead of erasing a very important part
    of world history?

    to Jews for centuries. I happen to think that it is perfectly possible to criticise
    the Israeli government and security forces, identify Ariel Sharon as the war criminal
    that he is, oppose the building of settlements in the occupied territories, favour
    the existence of a Palestinian state, etc. without accepting even a whiff of antisemitism.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant, I am not being spineless in recognising a distinction between
    the expressions people use and their intent, especially in this emotional and
    historically charged discussion. Trust me, if I came to the conclusion that you
    actually are an antisemite, I wouldn&#39;t hold back from saying so. <BR> <BR>As
    a Catholic, I encounter antisemitism on a depressingly regular basis, most often
    from people who don&#39;t even realise that they are being antisemitic. They&#39;ve
    simply grown up in a culture that has 1600&#43; years of ingrained prejudice behind
    it, and in a Church that has a long and problematic relationship with Judaism
    &#40;despite the recent Vatican teachings against antisemitism&#41;. So maybe
    I&#39;m particularly sensitive, but when I see careless language concerning Jews
    I&#39;m very aware of how that is received by many people: with a nod and as a
    confirmation of their prejudices, and as a very hurtful threat against the security
    and lives of Jewish people. I don&#39;t have a problem with anyone being critical
    of Israeli policies -- I even accept arguments about whether the state of Israel
    should exist as legitimate debate --, but please, people, be careful how you phrase
    things and don&#39;t let your protestations be fuel for hatred of Jews. That&#39;s
    all.'

    the swastika from the font will stop any antisemitism. It is my belief that the
    only way you will ever stop this form of persecution is by exposing it and making
    people aware of it. By removing the swastika, Microsoft has only swept another
    element under the rug, and this cannot be seen as a step forward against anti-semetism.
    Rather, this has hindered the cause, as people are able to make not thinking about
    this topic that much easier. Only when people become comfortable with and undertstand
    the meaning of the words Jewish, Jew, Nazi, etc. and the visual symbols that go
    along with them will people actually be moving in the right direction. <BR> <BR>By

    is a very good phrase. Between totally supressing all religious expression and
    seeking to destroy all religions except your own is a huge area of genuine respect
    for other persons and their beliefs. Most religious people I know occupy this
    area, and accept the struggle of showing love and compassion while not glossing

    <BR> <BR><i>I mind the syndrome that makes western Christians so uncomfortable

    are misinterpreting the phenomenon. I don&#39;t think Christians are uncomfortable
    with not everyone celebrating Christmas: in fact, a lot of observant Christians
    participate very little in the popular Christmas celebration. I do think that
    the shops and other businesses that rely on Christmas for huge consumer spending
    are uncomfortable about people not celebrating, and not celebrating by spending.
    This is why every year Christmas becomes less and less about the nativity of Christ,
    and an increasingly generalised &#39;Holiday Season&#39;. Last year was something
    of a nadir in Canada, with many municipalities not putting up Christmas trees
    or calling them &#39;Winter Trees&#39;. [To his great credit, the Jewish mayor
    of Toronto said &#39;This is silly: it&#39;s a Christmas tree and that&#39;s what
    we&#39;re going to call it&#39;.] I don&#39;t like this silliness because I don&#39;t
    like the Orwellian distortion of it and the subversion of religious festivals
    by consumer capitalism. I&#39;d rather there were no popular holiday celebration
    at all: I would still go to Mass on Christmas Eve, and my Jewish friends would
    still go to the synagogue during Chanukah. <BR> <BR>The irony of Chanukah being
    the Jewish component, as it were, of the syncretic secular holiday season is that

    Roman pagan worship. Practically, it was a way to distinguish the early Church
    from the Jewish community from which its first members came, to clearly establish
    the distinctiveness of the Church as something other than a sect within Judaism.
    Theologically, the shift from the last day of the week to the first day of the

  body: '<i>My use of the word mediaeval was not really meant literally. My suggestion
    was that in &#39;responding&#39; to the tragedy of 9/11, your choice to display
    a crucifix could be taken the wrong way by someone who viewed the world from an
    islamic perspective. Irrelevant of your intentions. </i> <BR> <BR>It is possible,
    but seems to me unlikely. More to the point, it is speculative. If a Moslem reader
    had written to me at the time and asked why I had the cross there I would have
    told him, or if he had written to complain I would have explained why. I&#39;m
    not inclined to police my actions just in case they might possible offend some
    person who might just possibly see them. <BR> <BR><i>In the same way that people
    of the Jewish faith &#40;or sympathetic to it&#41; may take certain indirect critical
    observations/comments as antisemetic, while others &#40;myself included&#41; made
    no such leap.</i> <BR> <BR>I have trouble reading the equating of Jews with Nazis
    as &#39;indirect critical observation&#39;. If you miss the antisemitism in that,
    then I&#39;m concerned. Only last Sunday, the French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray
    commented in an interview on &#39;the return of antisemitism in our Old Europe&#39;:
    &#39;[Not] to recognize it, not to call it by its name, is an unconscious way
    of accepting it. ...Its contours are vague and are not reduced to the Palestinian-Israeli
    conflict. ...The path that leads to Auschwitz is always before us and it starts
    with little weaknesses. Hence,&#39; he insisted on the need for &#39;constant
    vigilance and frank solidarity with the Jewish communities.&#39; <BR> <BR>As I
    mentioned earlier, there is a long established discourse of antisemitism, that
    uses stock phrases and associations to engender double standards and prejudice.
    The nature of this discourse is that individual phrases come loaded with a history
    of deliberately manufactured hatred that cannot be easily unloaded. <BR> <BR>There
    is, of course, anti-Moslem sentiment in both Europe and North America, but it
    has neither the antiquity, refinement or consistency of discourse that one finds
    with antisemitism. In North America, most anti-Islamic sentiment is attached to
    the so-called war on terror. In Europe, it is an issue of immigration and identity.
    But even in the current anti-Islamic discourse that surfaces in our societies,
    the cross is not an emblem or a rallying symbol for hatred; it is not, in fact,
    part of the discourse at all. Sure, idiot Bush mentioned the word &#39;crusade&#39;
    once, and then quickly apologised and made sure it didn&#39;t happen again. The
    Pope&#39;s very strong condemnation of the American-British adventure in Iraq
    was a much more prominent statement of the orthodox Christian position regarding
    the war and made it clear that in no way could the invasion be considered a crusade
    in the mediaeval sense.'

    I agree it&#39;s old &#40;Jews are old&#41; and sophisticated, but that&#39;s
    just a quantitative issue. But a concern for the reckless behavior of the Jewish
    lobby in the US as well as Israel itself also exists. One does not preclude the
    other. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty obvious to any objective and observant person
    that Israel is using the US like a big dumb cyclops to get away with the opression
    of Palestinians. What the &#34;Jewish communities&#34; need most of all is advice:
    that they get over it, and back off, if only for their own good. Many Israeli
    Jews are realizing this more and more, but their US &#34;brethren&#34; &#40;not
    being at any risk of life themselves&#41; are much thicker and fundamentalisic.
    In the same way that the victors of WWI took too many spoils and thereby laid
    a solid foundation for WWII &#40;and the Holocaust!&#41;, there has to be <i>fairness</i>
    for <i>anybody</i> to live on this planet safely. And lest you resort to the buzz
    phrase &#34;don&#39;t blame the victim&#34;, know that I&#39;m not interested
    in justifying genocide, just reducing it. I don&#39;t want more Jews to die. The
    best way to this is for things to be more fair than they are now. The only other
    option is annihilating everybody else. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

- body: Seventh-day Adventists usually make the arguments that 1&#41; worship moved
    from Saturday to Sunday because of the Christians&#39; desire to not be confused
    as a Jewish sect, and 2&#41; Constantine decreed the first civil Sunday law on
    March 7, AD 321, which according to Adventists, reflected his background as a
    sun worshipper. They say the church later followed this example. <BR>However,
    <BR>Acts 20:7 says &#34;On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together
    to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and
    he prolonged his message until midnight.&#34; The book of Acts was most likely
    written before 70 AD, therefore its events took place even earlier. <BR>1 Corinthians
