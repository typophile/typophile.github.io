  Thus I was organizing my font files by splitting then apart in categories so I could
  enable just the kind of font I would like to work with.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I became
  confused. \r\n\r\nI really don\u2019t know how to divide then. I don\u2019t know
  whether to usa the habitual font categorizations or create my own system based on
  their usage rather then on their \u201Cacademic\u201D category. \r\n\r\nParticularly
  I would like to split then in some kind of formal categorization but, since I\u2019m
  not an expert, sometimes it get\u2019s tricky to tell a Slab Serif font from an
  Transitional, for example. \r\n\r\nSo, I really would like to hear from you guys
  how do you deal with font files organization.\r\n"

  body: "If you use Linotype's new (and free) Font Explorer X (Mac only so far), you
    can make as many categories as you like, and the same font can be in more than
    one category. Other font management tools have this capability as well.\r\n\r\nThere
    is an old type specimen catalog that was put out by Phil's Photo (now known as
    Phil's Fonts) around 1980. It had what I thought was a very helpful way of categorizing
    its fonts. Here are the categories:\r\n\r\nEvenly weighted sans serifs\r\nThick
    and thin sans serifs\r\nBracketed serifs\r\nRuled serifs [e.g., Bodoni]\r\nSpur
    serifs\r\nSoft serifs\r\nSquare serifs\r\nExtra light\r\nUltra bold\r\nCondensed\r\nItalics\r\nScripts\r\nInline/Outline/Contour/Shaded\r\nOrnate\r\nRustic\r\n\r\nThe
    actual categories they used are not important. The thing is to come up with categories
    that are meaningful to you and to allow the same font to be listed in more than
    one category. If you limit each font to only one category, you will never come
    up with a usable system. This limited idea probably goes back to font catalogs
    or reference books in which each font could only be listed once to save space
    or money, so they had to decide which one of possibly several categories a font
    could fall under."

    cannot aways tell one kind of font from another.\r\n\r\nIt would be cool to hear
    more from others also.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "If you know what you have, go with kris' idea.\r\n\r\nGroup your fonts by
    foundry and/or designer. Take Martin Majoor. In my Martin Majoor folder I'd have
    the Scala collection, Nexus collection, Seria, and so forth. When I think of Martin
    Majoor, I think of clean, amazingly legible, humanist slab-serifs with perfectly
    suited, accompanying sans faces. \r\n\r\nThese days we are blessed with plenty
    of serif faces with an accompanying sans. They are designed to work together,
    so you might as well keep them together under the designer's name. "
