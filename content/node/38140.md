body: I can't seem to locate this body type, although some of the characters ( "y",

  body: "I think it's <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1328.html\">Garth
    Graphic</a>.\r\n\r\nNot sure about the weight though, hard to tell from this sample.
    But if I had to guess I'd say it's Regular combined with Bold Italic."
