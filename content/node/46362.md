  have any imagination) but I wonder if any forum members have a more creative idea
  for a Sans font to go with Philomela?

    oldstyle types. Maple seems to work nicely, at least the bold...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/philomela-plus-maple-sample_5313.png]"

  body: "Sorry for not replying earlier.\r\n\r\nI'm using it for a book of quotes,
    basically, and I want to set off each section with a double page colour spread
    with a title in a contrasting font (possibly in caps) reversed out. \r\n\r\nI'd
    like a font which, while complementing the main text, will give an edge of modernity
    to the book. An added advantage, I suppose, is that they don't appear on the same
    page. I'd originally tried Meta and suchlike but that didn't quite work. The contrast
    was too jarring. Feliciano's Stella is a possibility, but it isn't cheap!\r\n\r\nAddison,
    thanks for your reply. I'll see what wood type fonts I've got to hand."

    there aren't but two weights, it's equipped to handle just about anything.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    when it comes to sans capitals, Scala and Gill Sans come to mind -- especially
    Scala. But you may even try something like News Gothic or Trade Gothic Light.
    Just my immediate thoughts...\r\n\r\nI'd love to see your work in progress if
    possible.\r\n\r\n-Addison"
