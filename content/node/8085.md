body: 'There seem to be two problems really:  <BR>FontLab crashes on exporting Type1,
  after minor changes in a file I succesfully exported several times before from.  <BR>In
  the font I did manage to export some characters like Ampersand and Parentheses don&#39;t
  show up in use. I exported following what I read the manual &amp; Leslie Cabarga&#39;s
  book, but still.... <BR>I&#39;m kind of in a hurry: does anyone have a possible
  answer? Would be GREATLY appreciated.'

  body: Some inconsistences in outlines could cause a crash. <BR>I think you should
    apply for support from FontLab at <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html</a> and send them your
    vfb file. <BR> <BR>Johnych
