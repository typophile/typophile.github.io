body: "Hi! I'm a pupil at a German school in Portugal, and speak several languages.
  I mostly write texts for homework in languages which make use of many diacritics,
  like Portuguese, German, French, Swedish. My favourite font is Quiosco (http://www.fontbureau.com/media/images/specimen/characters/quiosco/quiosco_1.gif)
  . I'm looking for alternatives to this font, with some of these characteristics:
  1. All accents should be very visible. In Times New Roman, for example, the accent
  on the small i is very hard to distinguish from the normal dot. Accents play a very
  important r\xF4le in Portuguese: in\xEDcio=beginning, inicio=I start - c\xE1gado=turtle,
  cagado=shit. 2. The circumflex accent ^ should be large and visible, as it is in
  Quiosco. In most fonts I've seen, it is too close to the letter, too small, or too
  thin. 3. The trema \xA8 should be at exactly the same hight as the i-dot. 4. The
  ordinal indicator \xBA \xAA should be underlined (as in Quiosco), because this is
  part of the orthographic traditions in Portuguese. 5. The \xDF is a German letter
  used whenever a s is pronounced like ss, but follows a long vowel. It was created
  by a ligature, either between the long s (\u017F) and the old z (which looked something
  like this \u0292), or between \u017F and s. So in modern typography there are these
  two versions: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/\xDF_in_Arial_%2B_Helvetica.png
  . As the letter in German is called Esszett (sz), I'm prefer fonts which use that
  version. That's what happens in Quiosco, where, on top of that, there is a small
  stroke on the left side of the letter, resembling the appearance of the \u017F in
  some fonts. 6. The font should be serif. Thank you for your help."

  body: "As hrant said, a custom font would be the solution.\r\n\r\nI did a quick
    search focusing the diacritics, but not paying much attention to resemblance with
    Quiosco. Regarding the available serif families with good diacritics and underlined
    \xAA and \xBA, you may consider: Greta Text, Kingfisher, Tundra Pro, and Malabar.
    Some other quite different from Quiosco: Rooney Pro, Museo Slab, and Scotch Modern.\r\n\r\nWithout
    the underlined \xAA/\xBA but still presenting good diacritics: Argos, Calluna,
    Charter Pro, Guardian Text, Iowan OldStyle, Karmina, Freight, Marat Pro, Utopia,
    Alcala, PT Serif, Sina Nova, Sirba, Whitman, and Stuart Pro.\r\n\r\nSIL offers
    free derivations from Charter (Charis) and Times (Doulos), besides the original
    Gentium, all with underlined \xAA/\xBA.\r\n\r\nAvoid Meta Serif. Its diacritics
    are a disaster to set up texts in Portuguese.\r\n\r\nNote that almost all fonts
    use diaresis (trema) smaller than dot, especially in \xEF, although many adopt
    a subtle size variation. And Ezset is still quite rare \u2013from the lists above,
    I think just Calluna, Rooney, and PT Serif include it.\r\n\r\nA [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/char%3A\xDF+serif/fonts/|MyFonts
    search]] may help.\r\n\r\n[edited to add SIL fonts.]"

  body: "So Charles, I went looking at Brill again -a wonderful face*- and checked
    out its EULA, and I have to wonder: what made you recommend it in this case? I
    mean, the EULA doesn't allow modification (and I'm the one who advises people
    to ignore that sort of restriction, but you don't) so could you explain how to
    use InDesign to, let's say, change the look of an eszet?\r\n\r\n* Very nice \"g\"
    for one thing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hence the smiley in my original post - especially since he <em>did</em> say
    \"pupil\".\r\n\r\nOn the other hand:\r\n- Your numbers are way off. Example: there's
    a movie coming out soon for which I did a custom font, $1,500. Because it only
    took me about ten hours (which is still 9.5 hours more than it took Cameron to
    choose Papyrus for Avatar, the butthead).\r\n- Note the \"[ized]\" in my original
    post; that's <em>way</em> cheaper. When I was commissioned to add a bunch of accents
    for Sanskrit transliteration to Garamond Premier, it was only a few hundred dollars.\r\n-
    It remains that you can't legally change Brill's eszet for example. So why recommend
    it? Because it's free? I have a coupon for a free burger at In-N-Out. You wanna
    try using that to help marcdan? Go for it dude. And I'm sure he can get them to
    add truffles to the burger... for free.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "News fonts have massive x-heights for good reason - those proportions are
    not ideal for things like books. You can use smaller point sizes to avoid it looking
    horsey, but the main problem is there's little room for ascenders and descenders
    to play their important role in immersive reading (whereas reading a newspaper
    tends to be much more erratic and environmentally challenged, hence the need for
    good visibility = large apparent size = large x-height).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    usually make it lower.\r\nThe principle is well demonstrated in Times:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dieresis_3544.png]\r\nThe
    \uFB01rst \u201Cf\xFCl\u201D is the composite character from the font. In the
    second \u201Cf\xFCl\u201D I have vertically aligned the dieresis with the tittle,
    causing it to \uFB02oat up high among the ascender serifs, dissociated from the
    letter it is supposed to be qualifying.\r\nThe j\xE4 combination is frequent in
    Finnish, where it can be seen that varying alignment of the accents improves distinction.
