  Elementes. I was tapped to do the design, starting with the masthead. (EDIT: Logo)
  (Actually, does anyone have any advice for the steps in designing an entire magazine

    look different each time except the masthead.

    a different picture with a different color scheme, but generally the logo (it

    callouts and such?"

    you are going to make a logo with typography, I'd recomend you to use it as an
    image, like a metaphor. For instance:\r\n\r\nHerb Lubalin was very good at this,
    here are some EXELLENT examples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/families_4086.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mother_4591.jpg]\r\n\r\n[Mother
    & Child was a logo for a magazine that has never been published. It was designed
    by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase in 1965. Families logo was designed in 1980 and
    Marriage in 1965, by Lubalin.]\r\n\r\n{These logos are different combinations
    and manipulation of letters and they show the power of ideas in the hands of a
    master.}\r\n\r\nSo, i'd investigate the profile of the magazine, intrests, topics,
    public, etc...\r\nthen the name: why do you think they choose that name?\r\n\r\nAfter
    that, you could think how to represent the magazine ideas in one logo, with typography,
    sounds easy, right? haha :P\r\n\r\nHope that my point of view helps\r\n\r\nFerch\r\n\r\nPS:
    My native thongue is spanish, sorry for the miss spels and hope you understand

    compostion of the masthead* on the page is important in the case of magazines,
    are the black bars part of the masthead, what are the dimensions of the magazine?
    Since the group behind it are writers I suppose you should start your design with
    the proportions and then work on a grid that favours type over image (I assume
    there will be more type than you might budget for in a \u2018normal\u2019 magazine).\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n*I

    local magazine stand and look at the competition... See what you like and also
    what you don't like... Check out what works and what doesn't.\r\n\r\nAlso, speaking
    from personal experience doing a magazine for a group of writers, know what YOU

    but then will the logo remain this way throughout the life of the publication?
    Or will it change with every issue, reflecting the central theme of each one?
    You can have it either way, but be sure to think all of the possibilities through.
    For example, if you keep this logo the way it is for subsequent issues where the
    central theme is not water, what will readers make of the cradled <strong>e</strong>?"

    to it each time might be interesting. We're only planning on having six issues
    a year, so pre-planning the themes might allow for some interesting dialog with
    the logo as the year rolls on.

    name: Ricardo Cordoba

  body: "Dan, I think that what Ferch, James, Hildebrant and I are talking about is
    not whether the logo is well-executed or not... It is about what the logo is communicating
    about the magazine to the reader.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way: does the current
    logo tell Joe Bookfiend, who is casually perusing magazines at the bookstore,
    anything about the content or mission of <strong>Elementes</strong> magazine?
    Because to me, it is not transmitting the idea that this is \"[a]n art and literary
    rag\". Compare that to the logos that Ferch posted... they cleverly pun on the
    name and content of the magazines. The reader gets what each magazine is about
    without ever having to look at any headlines. While you don't <em>always</em>
    have to arrive at that kind of solution (a visual pun), these logos show that
    the designer put some thought into what he was trying to communicate. And that
    is what design is all about -- thinking ahead, planning, looking at things from
    every possible angle with a critical eye... knowing what you want to say, before
    you take pen to paper and start sketching.\r\n\r\nMaybe what I said before about
    the cradled <strong>e</strong> needs to be re-stated: you say that the central
    theme of the first issue was to be \"water\" -- if that were the theme of every
    issue, or the reason for the magazine, then sure, make part of the logo look like
    a water droplet. But if water is (or was) only the theme of the first issue, what
    will happen with the second issue? What will readers make of a logo that simulates
    a water droplet in an issue whose main theme is something completely different
    from water? And if the theme of the first issue is no longer water, as your comment
    seems to imply, then there is even less reason for keeping the cradled <strong>e</strong>.
    Don't hold on to an idea just because you've grown fond of it. Make sure it says
    something.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's a good idea to go back and come up with more
    logo ideas, or different ones. Or think through your logo strategy -- because
    there is no one \"right\" way to do this, no single \"correct\" solution. You
    could have the logo change with every issue, as we've both mentioned, always reflecting
    the theme of that issue and establishing a connection with the readers that way.
    Or you could come up with an entirely different concept that never changes. But
    this current logo idea, the cradled <strong>e</strong>, might seem anecdotal after
    a couple of issues, not to mention perplexing. You shouldn't make your readers
    guess at what they're looking at -- they might move on to the next magazine on
    the stand and not bother to pick this one up.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of guessing, I suppose
    the name of the magazine has something to do with the natural elements -- is that
    correct? Is there any special reason that the name of the magazine seems to be
    spelled in a foreign language? Those are also considerations if you are designing
    the magazine and the logo."

    A ramp with a guy riding it. \r\nWhen it comes to designing a magazine from scratch
    it is as already stated a good start to check out other publications that is in
    the same field. You should check out Monocle, it's awesome. Then sit down with
    the writers/staff, decide what exactly the magazine will be made of, and start
    doing a page or two, and keep adding and removing stuff as you go along. "

    of the logo to suit the content of the issue. first of all, your name is elementes,
    and while water is an element(e), unless your next issues are earth, wind and
    fire, your visual joke won't make much sense. additionally, taking that poor helvetica
    and manipulating it EVERY isssue is going to be a problem; sometimes you'll be
    able to pull it off, but just as often, i'm afraid it will look forced. the water
    tie-in already looks forced, and it's the first one!

    and leave it at that. That whole visual pun thing that Lubalin was so good at
    is really rather difficult to pull off. Most of his logos never really saw the
    light of day anyway."
