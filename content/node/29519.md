  site a few days ago that just had a black, red and white color scheme. I can't seem
  to find it in my history and I forgot to bookmark it. Anyone know of a site that
  fits this description?"

  body: Nope, thanks though. What kind of type? I remember some text fonts. Maybe
    custom? With samples of the work in use. I "think" some of the photos had a 3/4
    angle view.

    Constructivist in look.

    Arrrrrrrrr! (it's a bad Pirate Joke if you'd like to look it up)\r\n\r\nSo, here
    are the clues so far.\r\n\r\n1. Black and Red\r\n2. 3/4 view photos \r\n3. Russian
    Constructivist style\r\n4. Serif and sans-serif faces\r\n5. Mostly non-display
    faces\r\n\r\nBTW, the photos \"in use\" might actually be their own specimen books.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and:\r\n\r\n5 1/2. It's probably a European site.\r\n\r\nI've already been through
    the Type Foundries thread and have clicked on almost every link and still haven't
    found it. Thanks everyone for giving at a go."

  body: Maybe the lost set of keys model can work. Do you recall any site you were
    on before you got there? If you can assemble your path one or two steps long with
    certainty it migh be enough to cascade you there.

    is it might have been a few days ago, and between the endless links of Typophile...there's
    just no way to retrace steps. I've looked through all of the links available on
    my computer.\r\n\r\nAnd, nope its not Paratype...though the site appears to be
    down now."
