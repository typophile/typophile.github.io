  body: "What I like about Franchise.. The subtle rounded corners, the condensed letters.
    I also like the distinctive s.\r\n\r\nGarage Gothic is great, but it feels too
    retro I'm afraid. Bold is too thin and black is too thick, reminding me a bit
    of Poplar.\r\n\r\nI'm seeking a font that will be used on posters and billboards."
