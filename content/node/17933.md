  body: My opinion is not an expert one (like some of the posters here no doubt) but
    I have to admit to being repulsed by this one. Maybe its got bad feng sui.

  body: Actually it surprises and comforts me that you find DIN boring. Most art directors
    get a hard-on over this kind of aseptic tech sans faces, and it amounts to a lot
    of safe but ultimately bland "high design". :^)
