  entries to see if my particular request has been mentioned before. So forgive me
  if it has.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to identify the font used in Feist's 2007 album, 'The
  Reminder.'\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows what it is called, I'd really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "It looks like it's a font (duplicate letters look identical), but the letters
    look freehand-drawn. I checked my Serif Font ID Guide, and didn't find a match,
    but freehand lettering isn't strongly represented in the Guide. I guess that means
    I'm leaning towards a custom font.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: 'Stephen: Maybe... there is certainly some similarities. The ''R'' and ''S''
    are significantly unique from most of the fonts I''ve been able to compare this
    one to. Maybe down the road someone will make available this particular version.
    I really like the feel to this one.'
