    engine like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?&q=site%3Atypophile.com+afonseca1974\">Google</a>.
    Or you can use the \u2018track\u2019 feature of Typophile; go to your account,
    choose <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/user/22399/track\">track </a>.\r\nF"

    are new posts since yours."
