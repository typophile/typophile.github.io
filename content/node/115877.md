    body: Numbers look different, right? Well, maybe you're right. Just found this
      Sabon Roman SC & OSF inside the Sabon LT family which looks like the one. Thanks.

  body: The number in the book are indeed old-style (hanging) figures. In the fonts
    I linked to, these glyphs can be accessed by activating the relevant OpenType
    feature. Click on the gear symbol in the Tester tab on the FontShop site and you
    will see that you can switch small caps on and off as well as toggle between figure
    styles. Some software will allow you to make use of this functionality on your
    computer, some other will not. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/info/opentype-support-in-applications/">Here</a>
    is some information on that. If the application you use does not support advanced
    typographic features, you will need to fall back on separate fonts in which small
    caps are in lowercase slots and old-style figures are default.
