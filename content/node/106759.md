  new logo for the course, as well as make an advertising campaign strategy to promote
  to new and current students, also make to make a brochure and radio ad.\r\n\r\nCan
  you guys choose which logo is the best fit for my campaign poster/brochure?, also
  any comments on improvements on them will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n'Enmore brochure
  2' is what goes on the back of the 'Enmore brochure'. The brochure is 3 fold.\r\n\r\nOh
  and these attachments are very low quality, because my files were too big. The real
  color should be more red/pink instead of purple.\r\n\r\nbackground info on my course:

  body: "> which logo is the best fit \r\n\r\nMy opinion is that the eye symbol, although
    not very original (I've seen an eye used many times to represent graphic design),
    is more interesting and representational than a rectangle. Don't care for the
    way the eye reflections are drawn, though, or the squared-off left edge.\r\n\r\nBut
    you should use your own judgement, your own style, and then listen to the feedback
    from your professor. \r\n"
