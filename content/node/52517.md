  the second one with a little bit more feminity:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new_logo_3565.jpg]\r\n\r\nLooking
  at your works I barely think my logos are any good, but let's see your opinion.

    I can't see any relation between the wordmark and the drawing. Why not lose the
    drawing all together and focus on the wordmark instead?\r\n\r\nThe same is true
    for your second draft, although at least the wordmark has some more character.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, what is this logo for??\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign Hamburg]]"

    (including me) know anything about designing logos :) \r\n\r\nAnyway...thanks
    for your comment. I'll try to lose all the drawing and focus on the wordmark.
    I don't really have any ideas yet, but as soon as I come up with something, it
    will end up here on the forum."

    so there's really not much drawing in it.\r\n\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/_U-tpDNq16zo/SUAmJ5UMIxI/AAAAAAAAADs/drx9OqUHppw/s1600-h/logo_nr_3.jpg\r\n\r\n"

    But if you say it's for a college course, that's probably not too bad at all!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

  body: "the second go is way better. Looking graffiti or not it's exactly the way
    personal logos should be. If they're satisfied with it, then leave it, otherwise
    refine letter weights, because they do differ quite a bit.\r\n\r\nNicely done.
    I like it.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
