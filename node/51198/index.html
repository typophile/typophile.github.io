		<div class="commentbody">OK, there seems to be some confusion regarding the EULA. This is a special arrangement. All IP rights are with Dalton Maag on this font family. The DSMJ has the right to distribute the fonts freely as part of their 'exclusivity' for the next two years. 

The EULA also states that the fonts may be used on up to 25 workstations after which they become commercial. So, a corporate user will actually have to pay a license fee.

The EULA is there to ensure that users don't distribute the fonts themselves, as much as there are no modifications or reverse engineering. It is a protected font product like any other commercial font. 

So, I can put your minds at rest. The DSMJ is fully within their rights to announce this free download. As a user you may use the fonts in your work as you wish, as long as you follow the EULA.

If foundries can't make money off sales to less than 25 workstations because the market is full of free fonts like Aller, they may adopt a similar tactic and compete in "your" niche. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would like to say here, that it is not our usual policy to publish free fonts. In fact we don't give away any of our fonts.

The case of the Aller font family is different in that the client has paid for the development and negotiated the right to widespread distribution for the next two years. It's not that different to fonts being distributed with Windows. As we retain all the rights to the fonts we have full control over future developments and in two years time we have the opportunity to further exploit the fonts.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>It’s not that different to fonts being distributed with Windows.</em>

If a foundry makes free fonts available for one platform, that can lead to corporate sales for the other, and I've heard the theory that this accounts for a lot of the sales of the old sans faces such as Helvetica. Not sure how well that model would continue to work in the OpenType era.

My philosophy of font marketing (and digital ethics) changed considerably when I read Chris Anderson's essay on "Free" in Wired, although I haven't got around to incorporating my new attitude into any marketing plans yet.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Ok, two answers:
A download does not count as a license. The license talks of installation of 25 workstations. That means if you have the fonts installed on 75 workstations you are in defiance of the EULA, whether you downloaded the fonts once or a 100 times.

This is the typical Fontbook bug. It's been around for blimmin' ages and Apple (the lifestyle company) have done nothing to remedy it. This error occurs when TTF fonts are loaded with a missing 'fpgm' table. This table is necessary for hinted fonts but in unhinted fonts it has no effect whatsoever. You can safely ignore this warning. We ought to issue an update I guess.

You can only link for font styles together. The fonts are engineered so that the Bold can be accessed via the 'B' button in Office apps. That necessitates that the Light has to be separated into its own font family. The way the fonts are engineered at present give the most thorough formatting compatibility, accross platforms and documents possible.

Nick, could you share your thoughts?
I have not found yet a convincing "philosophy of font marketing" and I was just talking with Chester of these things… Thanks!

P.S. What do you think, in general, of the idea of "bundling" typefaces with software applications, as the perception of the public it may be considerably reinforced (in ignorance) to perceive all works as "not to be paid"?</div>

It is possible to include characters without a unicode code point, but this way the characters can be used with software that allows you to use any UC character (as opposed to programs that allows to select <em>any</em> character, such as InDesign).
It's not really necessary for the small caps function.

It is a very nice design, looks like Myriad but a bit less "cramped". Is it inspired by certain Dutch designs? (grin)

Yes, hinting: the font has been autohinted but that, of course, won't do the trick if good display is required. If we get some spare time and don't know what to do with our hands, we'll do some hard core VTT hinting on it.

Theunis, the font naming convention is intentional. This allows us the same naming for all applications, be they graphic or office. It also means that if a doc is created in one app, the doc can be opened, imported or whatever, in another wihtout losing the font name formatting. And since we're sticking with the 4-style font family it works fine in older versions of Win and Unix, too.

I realise that this may be a bit tedious for graphics users where you'd expect to see all styles in one font family. But it is a small price to pay for all round compatibility.

It is our policy to give all glyphs a Unicode value. I realise that a number of these are then put on private area. Not everyone may agree with this policy but I believe it is important to give access to these glyphs also to people who have no OT feature access, such as Word. And since it's Unicode, the glyphs can also be accessed using database driven copy, as long as the Unicodes are stringed correctly.

And then the question re TTF: it is our policy to produce TTF based OpenType fonts since we are confident that they work pretty reliably in a wide variety of environments. We create CFF based OT fonts only on demand.

My question re: low rez hinting is based upon my preference for high quality fonts for reading on screen, such as in Notepad (and as Windows default font for its windows as well). Oh well, I'll stick to (checking) hey, today it's Eurostile :-)

It sure looks to me as a very good book font -- I'm going to propose this to our clients. That's doctoral theses from our friendly local medicine university (Erasmus, Rotterdam) in small print runs (about 300), so don't expect to see one pop up in book stores near you soon.  I'm pretty sure the EULA allows this (...)

Thanks. But, assumed I assign to Small Caps (or other stylistic variations) a Unicode value from the Private Range area, has a sort of "standard" been developed or not?
I was oriented to stick with Adobe values, and see those also for the Greek Small caps.

Maybe I should have posted in a separate topic, but I am interested to hear what Bruno Maag says on this, if it happens he passes again…

<cite>The exceptions are the AGLv1.2 names which are associated with Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) values. These include all the superiors and small cap names. Use of these names will, for the purpose of searching text, lead some current implementations to map names like "Asmall" to the PUA Unicode value from AGL v1.2, rather than to the Unicode value for "A". We now recommend naming these glyphs according to the rules below.</cite>
Better only study Adobe's latest fonts like Arno Pro.

		<div class="commentbody">Theunis, hinting is always a nice thing to have. Unfortunately, the commercial reality is that is barely affordable to do for a foundry. It takes about six working days for a plain Latin font to be hinted to a good quality. If you add the S/C you'll increase that easily to eight days. No one is ever going to pay the premium for this in a retail product. The difference between a hinted v. unhinted font would be around £15 per font.

Yes, please do send me a PDF of the work. I would like to see it.

Re AGL1.2 and PUA - it appears that we haven't updated our encoding vectors. I am all for standards. We'll create future fonts to follow the AGL standard. But as explained above we had good reason for applying PUAs to the S/c.

@Bruno: what you say about production matters and hinting is very interesting.
How much time do you think it would take to develop a systematic production method (excluding hinting), and how much did you learn in time from the work of colleagues / other foundries?
Is that so different for a small foundry and a bigger one? I guess it all depends on how much you relate to "standards" or stray from them, anyway.
That's probably why I find so difficult to build one for myself… :=(</div>

The suffix is the same, because it really doesn't matter. TrueType and OpenType (with TT outlines) is basically is the same thing. The myth that TrueTypes are bad needs to be buried. 
In fact, as far as I understand many of Bruno’s postings, they even prefer TrueType/OT TT over CFF-flavoured OpenType because they considered it even a little bit more stable and compatible. </div>

It's not a myth. In many cases TrueType fonts are not as good as Type1 for display work.

When a font is created with PostScript curves, some distortion occurs when it's converted to TrueType curves, which happens automatically during the font generation process. If my practice is typical, type designers will generally draw their glyphs in PostScript mode, and not redraw glyphs to correct the distortions for TrueType generation. So there will be slight artifacts in the TrueType versions, that may occasionally mar the appearance of type at large display size.</div>

One could also blame history (the circumstance that saw the design industry using Type1 fonts and everyone else TrueType), or software such as FontLab, which creates the artefacts during conversion from PostScript curves to TrueType.

But I'm not trying to place blame, only trying to tell it like it is.

And it's not really a fault to publish a font that's almost perfect -- after all, as Bruno notes, very few fonts have full, character-by-character hinting.

Licences awarded now are perpetual. The only limit is that the number of users is never above 25 in those organizations which have acquired free licences.

When distribution rights revert to us it will become a member of our retail library, but the free licences will still stand. Those organizations needing more than 25 users will at that point be able to buy more.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi there.  I have more confusion regarding the license for this free font.  I'm working on a web project, and I was under the impression, based on the attached license, that embedding it in a website (via @font-face) was allowable.  Though it isn't exclusively mentioned, it does say this:
<cite>Font Software may be used to create or distribute any electronic document in which the Font Software, or any part thereof, is embedded in a format that permits editing, alterations, enhancements, or modifications by the recipient of such document.</cite>

However, I was having second thoughts and did a google seach for "embed "aller font"" and got this hit:
Web Embedding Aller FAQ - Dalton Maag (http://www.daltonmaag.com/about/aller_faq.html)
which explicitly disallows this use.  However, it seems to be in the context of a paid font, and nowhere else on the site can I even *find* Aller, so I don't know if it applies to the free version of the font or not.

Can you let me know where embedding via @font-face is allowed for this free version?  Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Kerri, it seems pretty clear to me that the page you cite does apply to the free version.  If so, embedding of Aller Sans is only allowed in EOT format (so, you can use it with @font-face with Internet Explorer only).  However, Dalton Maag permits you to use a solution such as [[http://facelift.mawhorter.net/|FLIR]] as long as you aren't concurrently serving up more than 25 pages that use the font.  As they point out in the [[http://www.daltonmaag.com/about/web_embedding_faq.html|general FAQ]], web pages get served up pretty darn fast, so that limit is probably not a big deal for most websites, assuming you're only using it for headings and not as a text face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for Aller, it is a nice typeface. Unfortunately, there is a bug which makes this font almost unusable for setting Czech or Slovak languages: non breaking space glyph "uni00A0" has zero width. Unfortunately InDesign CS4 (unlike the older versions) uses this glyph as a "proportional non breaking space". This space is used in Czech, Slovak and probably other languages as well to keep single-letter words together with the next word. Slavic languages do use many single-letter words, in Czech we have a, i, o, u, v, s, z, k. It is considered a mistake to keep single-letter word at the end of a line, so there is a plugin (distributed to all InDesign owners for free by the official distributor) which automatically replaces spaces by non breaking spaces after those single-letter words. When using Aller, the result is pretty bad: the space is replaced by a zero width characters so in fact the text is no more readable... Please consider copying the space width to uni00A0. Thanks!</div>

Moreover, a font description can harldy be considered as Font Software and it is hard "to give commands (whether by keyboard or otherwise) that are followed by the Font Software" considering that the "Font Software" are inerte files. So there are two possibilities, 
- either the license is invalid a one can potentially do whatever one wants with your font,
- or the license is valid and then it simply prohibits to use it.

Maybe you should have a look at http://creativecommons.org/choose/ if you want to distribute freely your work but keep your rights safe.
So nice work, but I won't use it as I am not sure that I have the right to :(</div>

I am pretty sure, Dalton Maag is familiar with CC licenses, but this was a design for a client and they are free to set up their license accordingly. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Were you guys speaking of Aniossar’s post regarding logotypes?

"Derivative Work" does not apply to logotypes.

"Derivative Work" applies to altered, edited, appended, or otherwise customized works based on the original font files.

		<div class="commentbody">Can somebody help me with the Aller font usage (I have little experience with font styles usage).

My understanding of the font styles is as follow (when creating styles in a word processor or presentation software - not a designer here)

Regular -> usage paragraph styles
Light -> usage (that's a good question - maybe short paragraph, e.g. intro)?

the Aller regular is very thick (bold) on screen and on print. I am wondering if regular is suitable to be used as paragraph style, or if I had to use the Light version instead?

It is about reports, A4 paper, font size text 12 pt, leading 0.08 mm (software: OOo Writer).

Thanks</div>
