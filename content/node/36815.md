  over for now. Who's going to ATypI?\"</a> thread, I (we?) will be organizing a Typophile
  Meet'n'Greet in Brighton. This as a reaction to the recurring complaints after every
  conference that fellow Typophiles didn't get the chance to meet, often because they
  even didn't know they were there.\r\n\r\nI propose that the gathering takes place
  on Friday night after the ATypI Auction which starts at 18h45.  I don't know yet
  where we'll have it, especially since I haven't got a clue how many will want to
  join us. Maybe it would be an idea to have some registration. What does everyone
  think?"

    :^)\r\n\r\nFredrik, you are correct. The official Typophile House is in the 'burbs
    -- that's why i was hesitant to offer holding the meeting there. Maybe it's better
    to pick some pub. Maybe we can even arrange something with some local venue. What
    does everybody think?"

  body: The SOTA/Typophile house is on the busline and there is an undercliff walk
    between there and Brighton that looks amazing from pictures. There are also cabs
    o'plenty. Once we all get to Brighton, we'll sort out the best place to have the
    Typophile gathering. I'm hoping there will be a central place at ATypI where people
    can post notices, but that's not always the case. We'll post details here once
    we know them. We can also put up a flyer and sign-up list in the SOTA TypeGallery
    for those who might not have net access in Brighton.

    we can all meet-up. There must be something in town that we can just take over
    after the auction.

  body: Lissenup, I'm going to talk ATypI into allowing us to have a sign-up list
    at the registration desk. That way we'll be able to predict the number of people
    a little beforehand, so we can adequately chose where to go. I'll try to whup
    up some posters.

  body: The auction has been cancelled due to lack of items. We're trying to work
    out a system to let any stragglers know where we'll be. Look for a notice at the
    main entrance of the University of Brighton (alternatively I'll just be waiting
    for any stragglers at the door).
