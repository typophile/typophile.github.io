A couple of quick things:
- The head serifs on the "u" should probably be leftward only.
- I would increase the ascenders by one pixel: it would help readability a good deal (and give you room to raise the bar of the "f", and make the dots on "i" and "j" two pixels tall).

As for the lc u, that was probably due to not paying a lot of attention ;-) It seems a bit odd now, but I'm not really sure it actually bothers me… I'll have to make a comparison first & let it rest a while before I decide (when you work on something for too long, you can't see the forest for the trees anymore). I'm still working on more swash variations & after that I'll take a break from Minimade for a couple of days.
The length of the ascenders however wás a deliberate choice. Along with the x-height & descenders, it was the only thing I had already determined when I started this. I didn't want it to end up looking too jagged, so I used the same measurements everywhere which I like to think it adds a little personality (or maybe amateurism? ;-p) to the font.
If anything, I think the descenders could benifit from an extra pixel, but again, I wanted to keep it simple.</div>

Yup.
Let's hope this moves into full consciousness on the part of certain people.

At this low res leaving them equal isn't so bad, but making the descenders <em>longer</em> than the ascenders would be a pretty bad use of the vertical space. The simply reason is that in real text ascenders are much much more frequent.

You see, that's why Typophile is very usefull for people like me who have no educational background in typography. When designing I don't even think about these things, but from now on it's something I'll keep in mind.

Since I started fooling around in Fontographer a couple of years ago, I already see some progress in my work.
Pixelfonts are actually great for learning about typedesign; they don't leave you with too much room for choice (or in other words, they eliminate a large part of  doubt) which I find quite stimulating, it justifies a mathematical approach (which again simplifies things) & its simplicity & sheer size can camouflage (or compensate for) a lack of know-how.
Thanks to the comments here, I'm also learning a lot about the relationships between characters & the actual use of a font.</div>

Well, in this thread Underware in particular, but in general I'm talking about designers who believe that their favorite world order is more important than the results. It's a justification of creation over function, which is Art and not Design.

> Pixelfonts are actually great for learning about typedesign

I agree (although many designers do loathe them). Besides the paradoxically refreshing limiting of choice, there is a purity to bitmap font design; something that makes you think in a certain healthy way that vector-editing tends to obscure. Maybe it's because the illusion is fully broken, so you can see -or at least feel- the heart of the matter.

		<div class="commentbody">I can imagine some typedesigners loathe pixelfonts, but in terms of designing is apples & oranges. It may be easier (especially to start with), but it takes a completely different state of mind.
I love vectors for their flexibility & 'weightlessness', but it's something very different. Pixels are not just about stripping down an image to its core, it's much more than that. The illusion is indeed broken, but you create an entirely new one with the right use of pixels (e.g. creating rounded shapes by pixelplacement). It has a lot to do with 'feeling' where all the pixels should (or should nót) go -much as bezierpoints in vectorial design- & it requires more thinking outside the box than vectors. Even though it may seem very technical, only by breaking the rules can you achieve a perfect bitmap.
For someone who's used to working with vectors, it demands a lot of flexibility on the designer's part.
At least, that's my experience…</div>

Could you whip up some text, in both the sizes?

Just looking at the 11 point Roman for now:
- Was the "2" always so cute? I like it.
- I would remove the inside pixel from the bottom-right of the "N".
- The "y" might benefit from a leftward serif at the bottom.
- Because your "a" is binocular I don't think you need that ungainly pixel at the bottom of the "ae".
- The eszet might look better with a smaller top bowl.
- I would connect the two parts of the pilcrow with a pixel at the top.

BTW, I'm pretty sure there's a limit to how much you can overshoot the em space (re: swashes) before you hit rendering problems in some OS/app environments.

Your comments make a lot of sense although I like the eszet as it is.
The N would probably look 'cleaner' without that corner pixel & I hadn't thought of giving the y a bottom serif, but it might improve if I do.
The æ is where I got caught up in my own rules (simply a + e pushed together) rather than 'flexible' aesthetics ;-)

I think you're OK with the double serifs on the "u" after all, but I'm starting to feel more strongly about your ascenders being too short. I'd love to find out what others think, but personally I can almost hear the font wheezing from being put in a straight-jacket! Giving the ascenders one more pixel would really help. I promise.  :-)

Some other things:
- It just hit me that your Bold is three pixels heavy. Did you make one that was two pixels but didn't like it?
- Your smaller size is generic enough not to warrant making... except for the swashes! So pay extra attention to them at that size.

		<div class="commentbody">I admit I got a little sloppy at the end; I just used the same swashes for the mini-version as I did for the regular which obviously makes the balance shift.
The 3-pixel bold was a deliberate choice since I wanted to make a bigger contrast than I could do with only 2 pixels. It looks more like a black version now & I might rename it later if I decide to include a 2-pixel bold as well. For the mini-version I did however reduced it to 2 pixels 'cause the dimensions of the characters would have to be to stretched too much to fit in the 3 pixel strokes. 
For the lc u I'll probably try to find another font that has doublesided serifs on the u to find comfort in. I actually like the way it looks & think it fits well with the other characters, but if it's just 'not done' I'll probably be too insecure to leave 'em the way they are. Any other thoughts and opinions on this would be appreciated.
I'll do a 3-pixel ascender version of the regular in the next few days (have to do some other stuff I shifted forward to finish this first) & post it here for comparison.</div>

Good luck... Not even the Romain du Roi (which has
double-sided ascender serifs) has doubles on the "u":

But that doesn't mean it can't work (especially
on-screen, which can be a very different animal).

Cool.

For the dots on "i"/"j", I think I'd make them two pixels vertical. You might also try leaving them two-horizontal, but raising them up one pixel to the full height.

The "t" might be better short.

A couple of other things:
- I'd give the UC "J" a bigger tail.
- Can you make the ampersand nicer?
