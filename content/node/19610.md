  get a better justification I allow ca. 2% letter spacing, using the justification
  palette.\r\nThis results in a small consistency problem, if you are real picky about
  your text. \r\nSome words are now using ligatures, others are not (when the words
  are letter spaced by the justification engine).\r\nCan you think of a smart solution
  to allow letter spacing on all text except the ligatures?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJonas"

  body: The only solution I can think of right now is to completely turn off ligatures,
    in order to make things more consistent.

  body: But maybe in a future version of InDesign, the threshold for turning off ligatures
    could be set a bit higher? (Though this doesn't help you with your problem now.)

  body: It seems to me that you should either use ligatures or don't use ligatures.
    If you are setting text that requires spacing which disallows the use of ligatures
    in some instances, you should turn off ligatures for the entire text. The appearance
    of ligatures will, IMHO, be too random.

    regards spacing as defined e.g. in the character palette.\r\nCan it be that the
    glyph spacing %-value in the justification settings (with minimum, optimum, maximum)
    has its own threshold? By the way -- % of what? With a typeface I tested, ligature
    substitution was switched off at 0.7% glyph spacing allowed in the justification
    settings.\r\n\r\nKarsten"
