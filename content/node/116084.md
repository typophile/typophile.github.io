body: "I need to select fonts to give a new business (mine - and I'm not a graphic
  artist) a specific vintage look and feel. Of course, I hope to create - as much
  as possible - a unified presentation for a variety of venues including letterhead,
  e-mail, e-commerce website (viewable on desktop, tablet and smartphone), print catalog,
  and collateral materials.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a unified look, the other interest
  was in selecting fonts to create a memorable impression for the business. I'd like
  the lettering to stand out enough that people might notice it is something a little
  different \u2013and yet be able to read it with ease.\r\n\r\nThe present product
  logo uses Benguiat which, while a \u201Cyoung\u201D font, was used to convey a product
  with qualities circa 1900 \u2013a little art nouveau and a little arts & crafts.
  A company logo is still to be designed, but the present thinking was to use Benguiat
  again to convey the relationship between product brand and maker. The website design
  target is essentially vintage modern \u2013basically how a turn of the century business
  might have designed a website (had the internet existed at the time). \r\n\r\nNow
  to my core question: My understanding had been that \u201Cserif is for print and
  sans serif is for electronic media.\u201D If so, having a single vintage serif font
  for text use in print and electronic media would not work. Please let me know if
  the use of serif fonts is still viewed as restricted to print (especially now that
  people are moving to ever smaller screens on smart phones). \r\n\r\nIf not, then
  are there particular serif fonts suitable to use \u201Ceverywhere.\u201D If a separate
  sans serif font is needed for electronic media, are there those best to use for
  that media which would also work well with a \u201Cserif partner\u201D for print.
  (BTW - Obviously, I do not think a single sans serif will work aesthetically for
  both print and web...but that does not mean I am right.)\r\n\r\nThank you for your
  input! (And sorry for the length of this, but it seemed best to provide the particulars.)\r\n"

    body: Thanks Nick! Korinna looks like an interesting solution--and like it should
      be good for use on screens large and small. Before I started reading on Typophile,
      I never really considered how much the selection of lettering could affect the
      presentation of a product or business. It is interesting to me that so few people
      seem consciously aware of the impact of lettering and yet I believe a large
      number are greatly affected subconsciously. I think the choice I make here is
      an important one and your assistance is much appreciated.

  body: ">  A company logo is still to be designed...\r\n\r\nIt's premature to be
    picking fonts if the logo hasn't been designed yet. (Unless you view them as temporary
    fonts that might change later).  You say that \"the present product logo uses
    Benguiat\", but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best choice for your company
    logo.\r\n\r\nYour entire identity system \u2014\_logo, fonts, color palette, website,
    printed materials, packaging, signage, etc. \u2014 need to be designed to work
    together.\r\n\r\n> I'm not a graphic artist\r\n\r\nIt would be money well spent
    to work with one. If you have a tight budget perhaps a graphic design student
    at a local college could help for a small fee."

  body: "Wether one should use sans for screen depends on your target group. When
    they still have SVGA monitors and older versions of Windows, I\u2019d say yes
    \u2026 ;\u2013)\r\n\r\nThe number of pixels on an iPhone 4 retina display is about
    the same as an SVGA Monitor. The screen is smaller, but the users tend to read
    it at a smaller distance. In the 1980s viewing distances between 50 and 60 cm
    were advised. Smart phones are held at about 50% of that, I\u2019d say. CRT monitors
    used to flicker, flat screens don\u2019t. Above that, subpixel rendering suggests
    a resolution that is 3 to 9 times higher than the physical resolution of the screen.
    Deciphering small details as may occur when reading, has become far less cumbersome
    than in the past I think. Therefore, typefaces that have serifs and a thick-to-thin
    contrast which resembles that of regular body text typefaces as we see in books,
    newspapers and magazines perform very well on screens these days. As you suggested,
    we are (again) in a situation where the rules-of-thumb from the past have to be
    reviewed and revised.\r\n\r\nThin hairlines and thin serifs such as they are often
    found in skinny versions of Bodoni and Didot or poor versions of classical typefaces
    such as Bembo and ITC Garamond light should be avoided for reading text though.
    Especially when sizes are relatively small and texts tend to be rather long. But
    in that context we did not like those skinny faces in printed media either didn\u2019t
    we? ;\u2013)"
