body: I was hoping for a little help.  I&#39;ve been looking around myself, but there
  is a vast knowlege base here.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to know if you know any fonts
  similar to these sketches, so I can figure out if it would be worth my time to start.
  <BR> <BR>Also, and this may be impossible to answer due to the very small number
  of sketched characters, does this seem like it might be worth putting a little work
  into? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32925.jpg"

  body: Hi Daniel. <BR> <BR>Yes and no I should think. That n is craziness :-&#41;
    Other than that the most &#42;original&#42; aspect in my opinion is the double
    serif &#40;on an angle no less&#41; instead of the standard triangular serif.
    The only thing I can think of off hand is the recent Romain du Roi thread in general
    discussions, though yours has some assymetrical palatino happening. <BR> <BR>Props
    for the sketches. If there truely is no Romain du Roi in digital format, maybe
    go that direction. <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR>Randy

  body: Those head serifs are more accurately called Jensonian &#40;or something&#41;.
    It&#39;s the style Morris applied in his imitation-Jenson stuff, and then the
    Americans copied it. See Jenson Old Style, URW Cloister and ITC Italia. The RdR
    head serifs are flat and severe. And to me this doesn&#39;t look very RdR at all
    - there&#39;s all kinds of chirographic stuff happening - the RdR is typographique
    par excellence. <BR> <BR>BTW, I think that &#34;n&#34; is an &#34;ri&#34;. <BR>

  body: I like the prominent serifs and general feel of your sketches. Especially
    if you&#39;re planning a full face including SC, oldstyle figures, alternates,
    and a whole set of ligatures, this could end up being a distinctive and stunning
    font. <BR> <BR>Maybe alter the right side of the serif on m and n

  body: Flashing my severly stunted knowledge of typographic history :-&#41; <BR>LOL.
    n = ri  &#40;either I&#39;m blind, or the dots on your i&#39;s are too high, but
    probably both!&#41; <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: Thanks, guys.  I&#39;m almost done with a digitized lowercase that might give
    a better impression of where I&#39;m going with this.  The historical references
    are really, really helpful. <BR> <BR>Randy, that was actually just playing around
    with the possibility of an &#34;r i&#34; ligature, but it looks too much like
    an n.  That might be an interesting alternate for the n, come to think of it.  And
    yes, the dots are too high. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Chase, I have a feeling that I&#39;m going to
    have to break a lot of my own rules to make this work. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  Let me show you the ditital version, and you can tell
    me if it&#39;s still too crowded.

  body: Okay, here&#39;s the first digitization of the lowercase   characters. <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33761.gif" alt=""> <BR>
    <BR>Loking at it, I think I&#39;m going to need to remove the double serif from
    the m,n,u, etc., but I figured I&#39;d ask what y&#39;all thought first.

  body: I really like this, Daniel. I like the double serif on the m, n, and u as
    well, but maybe you could &#34;scoop&#34; away some of the vertical stroke at
    the top right beneath the serif--just a little. The bowl of the b, d, p, and q
    look a little compressed--or maybe the a looks a little too wide? If experience
    serves me, Randy Jones may suggest that the r looks like a modified n. You may
    try lowering the joint where the arm meets the stem. The spine of the s could
    use a little thickening, too. I love the t. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m learning myself,
    so take this for what it&#39;s worth. My terminology may be a little off, too.
    Sorry. <BR> <BR>Good luck, <BR>Addison

  body: 'Daniel: Nope, the digital version is more of what I was envisioning; it looks
    great. Asymmetrical full serifs that are prominent but not overpowering and modulated
    stroke. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d add a touch of curve to the lower side of the ear on
    the lc G or make it a miniature version of the brushstroke terminal on the J.
    <BR> <BR>Great work.'
