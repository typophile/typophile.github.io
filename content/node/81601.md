body: "1) Other than the lack of support for most OpenType layout and substitution
  features, what are the special considerations for making sure fonts work well in
  MS Office on Windows? For instance, is there any weird behavior around vertical
  metrics, naming, etc.\r\n\r\n2) While some foundries sell \"office\" versions of
  their fonts, my impression is that these are basically the same as the regular OTFs
  but with the character set arranged differentl (e.g. lining figures in the default
  position, small caps in a separate file). Is that correct, or are there other common
  optimizations for these fonts?"
