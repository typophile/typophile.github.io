  body: The <strong>BBF</strong> looks like it is based on [[http://www.fontsy.com/font_details_20116.html|Viper
    Squadron]] and <strong>BAPTISED</strong> [[http://www.dafont.com/cgf-locust-resistance.font|CGF
    Locust Resistance]] which are both free, but the <strong>BY FIRE</strong> line
    underneath is the commercial font [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=ERSQ80005002|Eurostile
    Extended]].
