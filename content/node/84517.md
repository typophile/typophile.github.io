body: "Hi everyone !\r\n\r\nI am creating a brochure for a renewable energy agency
  called \"Natural Power\" that focuses it's business on Solar Panels.\r\n\r\nThe
  goal of this brochure is explaining the whole process of how a photovoltaic system
  works and the economic advantage of installing one in your home. This ain't a easy
  task as there are lots of information and laws that the reader has to digest so
  we thought about making a really user friendly design, a simple visual approach
  to try to make everything smooth and understandable from anyone. Unfortunetly, I
  don't have much knowledge about typography so I would kindly like to know what do
  the experts think of the sample pages(they are in the wrong order, but you get the
  concept):\r\n\r\nhttp://imageshack.us/g/217/tp5.png/ \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
  Do you think the type is legible enough ? Does this body and head line work together
  correctly?\r\n\r\nI'd love to have your opinion, let me know please\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

    in general. What do you think about this? Does the typography works in your opinion?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much,\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: "I know. But if I cant read it, I can't give proper feedback.\r\n\r\nLike
    page 3. It seems like a lot is going on there. Title with highlight. Bold. Underline.
    Every sentence a new line."

  body: "You are right timarts.\r\n\r\n It's all about comunication, and if the message
    it's not understandable the goal isn't reached, no matter how cool the text and
    images are. \r\n\r\nI am going to post again when the english version is finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee
    you soon,\r\n\r\nPierluigi"
