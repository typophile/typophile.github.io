    this would require web browsers to implement an expiration date feature, which
    is arguably DRM, and thus not something that the open-source world would accept. "

  body: "Hrant, from what I read in the German news about X-Pire, it will probably
    never catch on.\r\n\r\nThe person who wants to use it has to pay a subscription
    fee, then the site on which this person wants to post their images (e.g. Facebook)
    has to implement it (the images are in an encrypted format, so you can't just
    them as any other image type), and finally the visitors who want to see the images
    have to buy & install a plugin in their browser (the browser has to ask a web
    server of the x-pire vendor for a key to decrypt the image). And you can still
    make a screenshot while the image hasn't expired, and keep it forever.\r\n\r\nSo
    in theory, a method like this to expire fonts would be possible, but IMHO not
    worth the hassle to develop.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJens"
