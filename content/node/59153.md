body: We had to choose a book and design the cover so I chose German philosopher Friedriche
  Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. My teacher is too nice and never tells me what
  I can do to improve. So any suggestions on how I can make this a better design would
  be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Etah Chen.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/niet_5411.jpg]

    type, narrower text column and less leading would be the first improvement. Why
    go to the margins that close?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJ\xFCrgen"

    I just asked my teacher and he said \"It looks fine. It looks fine.\" but i'm
    pretty sure theres things that still need to be done to it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/niet_5033.jpg]"

    of the ragged type at the bottom of the cover if everything else above is centred."

  body: yeah, the top of the back cover looks weird to me too. i did the ragged type
    at the bottom of the front, because i thought if everything is centered, that'd
    look boring and i was trying to add variation

    and... i'm not sure. maybe it needs a title or headline in the back[img:sites/default/files/old-images/niet_5982.jpg]

  body: 'Just my thought: on the front, the author''s name, Nietzsche, is much smaller
    than the translator''s - Kaufmann. It doesn''t seem to me a good choice. I would
    move Nietzsche''s name on the top, near the title, trying to find a balance between
    them. Another thing I would try to avoid is using so many fonts: there seems to
    be Big Caslon, Adobe Caslon and Baskerville there - one should be enough.'

    about that. Thanks. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/niet_3529.jpg]

  body: It's more correct now, for sure. But if I had to set this cover (with no editorial
    restricions) I'd try to push the word "Nietzsche" to a very *big* size, since
    the subject "Nietzsche" is, in some way, and from my point of view, what I'm looking
    for if I enter a library and look for a book by him. Or at least I would try to
    balance more the author and the title display size. Then, I would gain space,
    if I nedded it, by setting the last three bottom lines smaller. Nothing against
    Walter Kaufmann, but, again, the point here is Nietzsche, not his translator.

  body: "Hi Etah\r\n\r\nThe last-but-one example (first response to ncaleffis' advice)
    works becasue it pushes the author name better; this book was not the only one
    that Nietzsche wrote... so it could be seen as a design that would work for a
    series.\r\n\r\nAs Juergen was hinting earlier, it's not a good idea to mix left/right
    alignments with centered all in the same layout; pick one organisational axis
    and stick with it. That said, you should centre the big Nietzsche name \u2013
    we can tell it's r/left while the title below is centered...\r\n\r\nGood luck
    with the assignment. (Oh and if you think it needs a title or something on the
    back cover, consider using a drop capital to kick off the text in the top left
    corner.)"

  body: "It's starting to look very groovy. If your teacher really is too nice to
    tell you how to improve it, enclosing my 10 cents worth:\r\n\r\n1. You need bigger
    margins and on the back the lines could be broken better (eg. second line take
    \"He\" to the next line) There are too many hypens eg. get \"influential\" onto
    one line and see if you can avoid breaking names like \"Zarathustra\". I'd move
    the photo down to line up with the last baseline on the first column to give yourself
    more space.\r\n\r\n2. Get the barcode to line up with the text margin on the left.
    \r\n\r\n3. Think there's too much line spacing between \"Prelude to a Philosophy
    of the Future\" bit and maybe move it up to get it to correspond with the \"Penguin
    Classics\", ISBN and price on the reverse.\r\n\r\n4. Completely agree with ncaleffi
    and ben_archer that a huge \"Nietzsche\" is a good idea , so that it can be part
    of a series. You could even try removing the \"Friedrich\".\r\n\r\n5. Not important
    but for a late 19th century German philosopher you could also try using a late
    19th century German typeface.\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"The subtitle, typographically, needs to \u201Cbelong\u201D more to the
    title.\"\r\n\r\nI agree. etahchen, visually you should consider three degrees
    of importance, in my opinion:\r\n\r\n- The author - Nietzsche, a philosopher but
    also a sort of popular culture superstar - at least here in Europe. One how is
    read not only by students (who can hardly understand him) but by generic readers.
    And whose last name only can easily get the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\n- The
    book title - which should be bound more to the subtitle.\r\n\r\n- The editing
    and translation reference. Again, Kauffman, the least important element typographically
    speaking.\r\n\r\nIf I were in you, I'd try to balance these three different elements
    in the front, with different sizes and positions. The first example you posted,
    apart from Nietzsche's name, was interesting by this point of view, and I think
    you were heading towards the right direction."

  body: Thanks guys. I know I was suppose to center everything in the front but the
    "prelude to a...", the 'p' hits the 'y' above in the word 'beyond'. so i couldn't
    really center that part. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/niet_5252.jpg] wow.
    i did like 5 revisions already. But I learned a lot from all the suggestions

  body: "The title \"Beyond Good and Evil\" should be centered on the page. It looks
    disconcerting with a wider inside margin. And is it intentionally flush right
    with Prelude....?\r\nIs \"Translated, with Commentary, by\" supposed to be centered
    with \"Walter Kaufmann\"? visually it looks off.\r\nBack cover, is it all running
    text? Or is the knock out about Nietzsche and the rest about the book? If it is
    continuous text I think it should all be set at the wide measure, you can still
    wrap around the photo. And finesse it so the margins, especially top and bottom
    are all equal. If it is two separate pieces of copy perhaps having a run in bold
    subhead to further emphasis the two separate blurbs. You also want to tweak the
    margins on the back, because the copy is ragged it looks like a misprint with
    the copy closer to the outside."
