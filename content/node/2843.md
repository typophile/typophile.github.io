body: I may be asking an old question, but I have been wondering recently whether
  there are any books/publications specifically on type design, because I know that
  there is a plethora of books on typography. I would also be interested to know what
  the type design educators use, if there are any universal or valuable resources.  <BR>

    book. It is now back in print in paperback, so it is again accessible.  <BR> <BR>The
    way Tracy analyzes typefaces is really wonderful. He usually critiques individual
    letters from the point of view of how they harmonize or fail to harmonize in the
    overall face, and so how they work or fail to as text types. He is so experienced
    and with such broad tastes - he appreciates both van Krimpen and Goudy! - that
    the book is really an education, at least for this amateur typophile.  <BR> '

    information on type design. I also found Frederic Goudy&#39;s book &#34;Typoligia&#34;
    contains a lot of useful information. &#34;The Verbum Book of Digital Typography&#34;
    &#40;1991&#41; has several good chapters about type design with specific techniques
    in Fontographer described. It&#39;s a bit dated, but no more so than the Moye
    book.

    him several things for research purposes. I was surprised. I wound up inadvertently
    inheriting a massive amount of very interesting multiple party correspondences,
    all copyrighted. I thought that was unusual. On the other hand, it all was. I
    would love to tell you what was in it, but it was, as I say, copyrighted.

    be out in early February. The book is up on amazon.com though they don&#39;t have

    Illustrator and Fontographer instructions. I tried to make it the BIBLE, though
    I know there&#39;s lots more to say. And I&#39;m counting on all you typophiles
    to &#34;beta test&#34; the first edition and let me know where I&#39;ve erred,
    so I can correct the next edition. For FontLab, I&#39;m now working on &#34;Learn

    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s great news, Leslie. I know there are a lot of people who will
    appreciate this book. One of the most common things I hear from people new to
    FontLab is that they find the learning curve very steep and the manual hard to
    follow. I&#39;ve been using FontLab for almost ten years now, so have picked up
    on the features of the current version as they were introduced, rather than having
    to learn them all at once.

    You can -or <i>need</i> to- re-read it every couple of years to get everything
    out of it. I used to see that as a flaw, but then &#40;thanks to Kent&#41; I realized
    that was <i>my</i> fault! It simply has information useful to people at many levels,
