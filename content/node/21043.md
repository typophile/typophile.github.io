body: I'm new to Dreamweaver and I'm trying to use the Flash Text feature, but the
  font I want is not showing as available in the Flash Text specification window.
  A quick survey of a couple of the fonts that do show available seemed to indicate
  that TrueType fonts were showing and others were not. Can Flash only use TrueType
  fonts? Does anyone have any ideas on how I can use a Postscript font (Akzidenz Grotesk)
  in Dreamweaver MX 2004 Flash Text? I'm on OSX 10.4 and loading fonts with Font Book.

  body: If you just activated the font, it may not show up right away in Flash. Sometimes
    Flash seems to require a system restart to recognize newly activated fonts.

    body: It's not a newly activated font -- actually several enabled fonts don't
      show up in Flash.

  body: I don't know what other advice to give you. Flash does let you work with Postscript
    fonts.

    body: "If Flash doesn't have a problem with Postscript fonts, then I think there's
      a problem with it reading/recognizing them. Dreamweaver reads them just fine.
      Who knows?\r\n\r\nThanks."
