body: "Looking for font suggestions/general insight.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working
  on the website & art direction of a soon-to-be-launched women's online fashion shop.
  The feel of it is supposed to be \"up scale\" and kind of exclusive (not cute or
  kitschy at all). I have been trying out logo sketches and other things with Lineto's
  \"Brown\" typeface and LOVING the way it looks and how it communicates the brand.
  \r\n\r\nexample: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen shot 2014-07-22 at 11_4654.38.41
  PM.png]\r\nhttp://lineto.com/\r\n\r\nThe only problem is the price being nearly
  $200 for one single weight, which the sole starter of this business is not crazy
  about. She does very much like the font as well, but is suggesting I try and find
  a free alternative. I've been looking far and wide and I simply don't think anything
  free can hold a candle to Brown's strong, geometric form.\r\n\r\nSo my questions
  concerning this are:\r\n- Does anyone know of any free (or at least cheap) alternatives
  to Brown that I simply haven't stumbled upon yet?\r\n- Is buying Brown a good investment
  for the company and should I try to convince her of how important it is?\r\n\r\n-
  And additionally, I'm looking for some basic insight into if anyone has experience
  using Lineto's typefaces as webfonts, and knows which format(s) would be the best
  to buy and how I would go about hosting them. "

    a few bucks on something that's not as right.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "I saw Campton right after making this and I was thinking that may be the
      best alternative. Although I'm now being swayed a bit by the pointed capital
      letters in Radikal (and that cool \"k\"), the only thing that bothers me slightly
      is the way the lowercase letters are more oval-y rather than perfectly circular,
      but in general Radikal looks like it has a lot more flavour to it.\r\n\r\nAny
      suggestions on decent pairings with Campton or Radikal? I was hoping to go with
      a Mac-available font like Adobe Garamond for body text but I'm not so sure it
      fits."

  body: "If you go for a cheap alternative, what you will get is a cheap alternative.
    It will not look \"up scale\".\r\nBrown is a stronger design than the alternatives
    proposed here. \r\nBut my guess would be, if your client is asking you to look
    for a free alternative, his concern is not about quality. I would respond to such
    a client \"should I look for free alternatives of your fashion?\".\r\nI can understand
    a client not wanting to spend 200$ on a font to set a poster, but for the brand,
    this seems like a cheap price to get it right."

  body: "I agree that Brown is still much stronger than Campton but I think for now
    I'm going to go with it. I'll be using it pretty sparsely on the site so it doesn't
    draw attention to some of the weirder glyphs (the C is a real bother to me) and
    I've edited it a bit in the logo so it looks more like Brown. I think once the
    business starts making money then maybe I can suggest purchasing Brown for use
    on posters, and lookbooks etc.\r\n\r\nIf I'm willing to do a little bit of editing
    here and there though, I can bring back some of the \"Brown\" feel to Campton:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    for web, but if I'm feeling like being a bit tedious for display copy in print
    I could do this)"

    logo at the very least Campton still looks better. '
