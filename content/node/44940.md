body: "I use an Wacom Intuos 3 tablet with pen and mouse. Sometimes I find that the
  pen is too sensitive for certain tasks. A good example is in the Metrics Window.
  Sometimes if I click on a glyph instead of just selecting it, it will shift the
  glyph about. I don't think this kind of sensitivity can be adjusted in preferences
  for the tablet. Is there a way to lock the glyph itself (not the sidebearing lines)
  so this doesn't happen? \r\nThere are times when its a problem in the glyph window
  as well, but the metrics window one seems most annoying.Sometimes I don't realize
  I'v accidently nudged a glyph till I see that it doesn't connect properly in my
  script font. I'm hoping some tablet users will share their remedies.\r\n\r\nStephen

  body: "So if I understand you right, you want to adjust the \"drag\"-sensitivity,
    so it takes a bit of dragging before a glyph really is moved.\r\n\r\nI can't find
    an option to this in the wacom driver panel, and I guess it is a system/application
    setting, as it is about interpreting the input, not measuring it.\r\nIn Windows,
    you can adjust how far the mouse have to drag an icon before it is interpretted
    as dragging, but this setting has no influence on applications like fontlab, it's
    merely for file management.\r\n\r\nIf it helps you: This sometimes happens to
    me as well, even though I prefer the mouse in fontlab (not making script fonts)."

  body: "I have had the same issue you describe with the sliding click. One way I
    solved it was to map one of the quick keys to a mouse click. This avoids pressing
    down with the pen and sliding a little while you depress. You just hover of the
    things to select and press your mapped key. \r\n\r\nWhat works for me is setting
    one of the switch keys on the pen to mouse click, the other to double. That helped
    me with the sliding click.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I have not tried it, you might
    want to change the pen tip to the felt one for a little more friction. Not sure
    if that helps."

    <em>brilliant</em>. I might actually start using my Wacom for vector work now.
    Thank you for posting!"
