  like to hear if anyone thinks this thing has legs, or if it's a lost cause. I know
  it's got some problems, but that's why I'm here.\r\n\r\nNow for your critiquing

    Century chrome scripts. Rather than trying to make a complete font, I'd use this
    for one-off custom lettering or a logo.\r\n\r\nI think your W should be symmetrical
    like your V, and the tail on the Q could be a lot less heavy. The S & Z don't
    quite work for me, but reversing the Z might make a slightly better S. The J might
    work better with the bottom serif being on the left side too.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions and sorry for the delay. I've made some changes
    to the characters and working on a set of numerals. (I know the 2 and Z can be
    confused, but I'm working on solving that.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Silverback-Sample2_3984.png]\r\n\r\n<strong>Justin::</strong>
    The letters started from a sketch I did about a year ago and at the time I was
    looking at a lot of stock certificates and old financial documents. While I wasn't
    consciously doing it, the influence must have crept in there. But your comment
    now gives me a source to mine for the problems I cross. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    I've changed the W per suggestions and dug it.\r\n\u2022 I flipped the Z design
    to make the new S and it looks better. The old S was too round.\r\n\u2022 I was
    experimenting with the J design. It <em>does</em> look better with the serif on
    the other side.\r\n\u2022 Made a new tail for the Q. I think it has the right
    weight and really makes the character unique to the font.\r\n\r\n<strong>riccard0::</strong>
    After careful consideration and experimenting, I didn't change the \"beard\" on
    the G. The alternatives didn't carry the same strength and weight I wanted to
    keep."
