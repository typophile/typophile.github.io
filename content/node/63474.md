body: I've got two fonts here, both of which seem very familiar, so this might be
  super easy. They're both fairly narrow sans-serifs that give a bit of an aged feeling
  in their usage. I've found similar fonts, but I can't seem to nail them exactly.
  Am I missing something simple?

  body: Hey Mike, thanks, but I'm pretty sure all of Knockout's weights feature a
    curved leg of the uppercase R, and neither of these fonts do. Let me know if I'm
    mistaken; thanks for the help!

    menu item]], which is also like the test drive function. There are two R styles,
    and the second one uses a straight leg, just like your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
