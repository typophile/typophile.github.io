  my first post, so hello to all! :)\r\nI write this because I really need someone
  that can help me to find an old Nebiolo Specimen which contains Forma typeface.
  I'm a young student and I need it for my bachelor's degree. Do someone have a specimen
  containing that typeface? If someone do have that, can you please scan some pages
  for me?\r\n\r\nI'll be very thankful, for every image or tips.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGianluca"
