body: does anyone have any advice for rasterizing type - especially small type, but
  any type really - for sceen &#40;web&#41; use? <BR>i&#39;m creating the images and
  type in illustrator, and then either &#34;saving for web&#34; or outputting a tiff
  and funking with that in photoshop. neither have really proved satisfactory - antialiasing
  is too fuzzy, or just not quite on point. <BR>i suppose i could work only in photoshop,
  but im far more comfortable laying out type and such in illustrator, asi i spose
  i should be. <BR> <BR>thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>ben <BR> <BR>oh. see the type
  at <a href="http://www.theeaves.com" target="_blank">www.theeaves.com</a> for example
  of obnoxious rasterizing for screen. small type is getting lost, or fuzzed. blech.
