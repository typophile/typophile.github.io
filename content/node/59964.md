  magazine that wasnt mine (and that didnt list the fonts they were using) I dont
  know the name of the font.. but even worse, I dont have any pictures of it.. So
  I have really quickly drawn a sketch of the letter M to get the feeling of what
  the font is about. The curl is the main ingredient of the font.. \r\n\r\nSo if you
  know any kind of font that may look a bit like my bad sketch, do not hesitate to
  name drop!! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so very very very much!!! ;o)"
