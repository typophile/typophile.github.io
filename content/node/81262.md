  is ITC New Baskerville Std, and I am willing to settle for that one if push comes
  to shove. Any suggestions? Thank you!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mbblogo_6297.jpg]"

  body: I spent a good time looking for this and it's more difficult than it first
    appears. (I mean, how many Baskerville-esque transitional typefaces are there?)
    One potential replacement would be slighly squooshed Georgia, but the r and c
    terminals are wrong.
