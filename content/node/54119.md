  body: "I would guess it is handwritten because the same letters are drawn differently
    throughout the phrase.\r\n\r\nOpentype format makes that possible in a typeface,
    but there are few available that are doing that already.\r\n\r\nI have never purchased
    anything from [[http://www.fontgarden.com/shop/|font garden]] but I once read
    about this \r\nfoundry that specializes in turning handwriting into fonts. You
    may be able to find something similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
