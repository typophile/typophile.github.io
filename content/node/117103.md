  a project for a client that doesn't have a vector format of the logo.\r\n\r\nNot
  going to try and redraw the illustration...but would love to at least use the wordmark
  below.\r\n\r\nHaving trouble identifying the typeface.  Reminds me of Trajan. I'm
  sure the N and R in a few instances are customized.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if this
  rings a bell for anyone.\r\n\r\nThanks all."
