  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Howdy,</p>
<p>After much sketching, doodling and mucking about, I&rsquo;ve narrowed down my pesonal logo to two options. I&rsquo;d really appreciate it if I could get your opinions on em!</p>
<p>FYI: I&rsquo;m a graphic design student, graduating this semester. This ID will be on my business cards and resume until I&rsquo;m gainfully employed - and those items will be designed around whatever logo I go with. Keep in mind these are preliminary computer comps and the colors are (somewhat) arbitrary at this point.</p>
<p>My own personal thoughts, : I like the top one a lot but fear it may not seem very exciting; and I also worry if everyone will read it correctly.  The second one I like; but, fear it may be too whimsicle and gimmicky.</p>
<p>Share your thoughts – good, bad, or ugly.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I see the second as a warning sign, spectacles ahead, kissing snakes, (mainly because of the yellow diamond, I think), while the first has potential, it needs some work to it. Trying a B with uneven bowls might work and trying to get the shapes at top and bottom of the B to relate as serifs to the C or try a ball terminal on the C, the counter also needs work. I think it does read fairly instantly and it is a mark that is going to appear with your name, as to whether it is exciting, does it need to be? More important that it is well created and shows a good appreciation of letterforms, after all you are not going to need to use it for long, hopefully.
Good luck on the job seeking.

<p>I could play around with the first one a bit, based on your suggestions, just one question: what do you mean by &ldquo;the counter needs work&rdquo;? Since, in the logo the entire letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; is the counter&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>just a word of advice&hellip;i&rsquo;m always very dismissive of resume&rsquo;s, letterhead and business cards that bear the mark of the person. 95% of other designers i work/worked with feel the same way. why? i think it&rsquo;s usually because they are bad and due to the fact they are poorly designed and not well thought out, it shows even more the designer is unfamiliar with symbols, shapes and letterforms. these are usually two letters of someone&rsquo;s name combined in some juxtaposed way creating one unified shape. i&rsquo;d much much much rather see time and effort put into organizing information well on a page such as your letterhead and/or business card than a symbol that is usually non-representative of you as a person or you as a designer.</p>
<p>to sum up your design skills, your talent, your past 2 or 4 years and your personality into one mark is a tough job. coming from someone who sees portfolios and resumes on a semi-frequent basis, stick to your design of your collateral. leave the identity branding to the corporations and let your design skills represent you.</p>
<p>my 2 cents&hellip;if you really want some feedback on what youve posted, let me know via email or a post here and i&rsquo;ll help out where i can. i would just recommend staying away from this route</p>

<p>just one question: what do you mean by “the counter needs work”? Since, in the logo the entire letter “C” is the counter…</p>

<p>Yes, that could have done with more explanation I mean the open counter of the C especially on the left looks cramped, either extending it left beyond the B or taking the right hand of the C further right into the B might be a solution.</p>
<p>Will makes a good point about the quality having to be tip top and the layout will have to reflect that otherwise the reader will get a bad first impression.</p>
