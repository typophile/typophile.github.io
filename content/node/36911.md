  but i just can't imagine the a-hole exec that said \"yeah, it's fine and everything,
  but we really want those special g's, you know, the ones with the two circles? yeah,
  make them like that.\"\r\n\r\nhere's an example of one (someone else's flickr):
  http://www.flickr.com/photos/rhcooper/1342938354/ \r\n\r\nif i'm not mistaken, that's
  a Trebuchet two-storey g f-ing pasted right into Conduit. \r\n\r\nIT'S TWO DIFFERENT
  oh my god. you don't need to know anything about weight and proportion to see that
  this is a monstrously awful idea. what self-respecting typographer could allow this
  to happen.... not to mention that it's AWFULLY similar to Interstate, which cbs
  has been using for quite some time now....\r\n\r\nthis brings me to my point: i'm
  new to the field, and haven't had much experience. i'm sure abc has different tiers
  of in-house designers who assign effort based on the importance of the work... i
  guess. but this is their branding typeface, we're supposed to understand it as abc's
  voice when we see it, no?\r\n\r\nmy question: has this kind of crap ever happened
  to you? what kind of people are responsible for saying \"No, I want THIS\" and completely
  farting everything up in this fashion? \r\n\r\ni have to prepare myself to meet
  this head-on, because this isn't the FIRST time i've thought to myself \"um, what
  were they thinking...\" when I looked at a corporate ad....\r\n"

    so who would want to REPLACE that) and the g isn\u2019t from Trebuchet. I think
    this IS ONE typeface and you\u2019re hallucinating.\r\nApart from that you\u2019re
    right about the quality of typography or design in general in advertising. Most
    of the time it isn\u2019t all that great."

  body: "ouch. you're right about conduit, i didn't look hard enough. maybe it's some
    kinda DIN -- or i guess it's gotta be one typeface then?\r\n\r\nbut i could have
    sworn while staring at these things in the subway that the g was of a different
    face; it's hard to tell from the sample but it looks SO out of place. \r\n\r\nany
    ideas on what that main typeface could be?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Mr. Groth, you should probably read the original post, which says, \"if i\u2019m
    not mistaken, that\u2019s a Trebuchet two-storey g f-ing pasted right into Conduit.\"\r\n\r\nActually,
    Mr. Kwiatek was not not mistaken, and Conduit/Trebuchet typeface is actually a
    single typeface, in this case \"Aaux\".\r\n\r\nThe other typeface is Trajan, as
    you say.\r\n\r\nJN"
