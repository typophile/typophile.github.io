  1) mainly increase weight on the insides of the letters and less on the outside
  2) bump the x-height a bit.\r\nIs that right? or why do i have these guidelines
  bouncing around in my head?"

    a final critique was explaining her typeface choice and told the professor/class
    that she didn't have the extended 'version' of the font so she just stretched
    it horizontally....*shudder* (needless to say she got a D)"

    into is broken links to old threads. I hope those get fixed somehow someday."

    posting a graphic from Frutiger that showed the technique clearly. I can't find
    the scan anymore, but the whole thread should be in the archive somewhere.\r\n\r\nJames"

    with the fabulous drawing from Frutiger. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I found the thread
    with the applet (is that the right word?) that Grant Hutchison supplied early
    in the new version of Typophile. You can do the same thing by limiting your search
    on Google to the typophile site, which is what the applet does.   "
