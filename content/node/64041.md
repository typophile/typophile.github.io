  the typographic shift we all felt in the world of graphics when Ikea changed their
  font from a custom version of futura to a standard web based one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikea_fonts_3690.jpg]\r\n\r\nRecently
  a client suggested to me that because they couldn\u2019t use their custom font for
  all materials, for example online, in word or power point, perhaps they should switch
  all literature to Calibri to match the digital stuff. You can see what they were
  thinking...a brand, any brand is based on consistency right? Its the repetition
  of a feature or attribute over and over, until people begin to recognise it and
  associate it with your particular company. Obviously my reply was \u2018no way!!!\u2019.
  The problem with screen fonts I explained is that, yes you can have it consistent
  across all platforms, but it is also consistent with about 25% of all other online
  stuff out there. In order for it to be recognised, it also requires differentiation,
  otherwise everything blurs into one and you will never stand out or be recognised.\r\n\r\nSo
  I wonder now, wether this was actually happened with this whole Ikea thing. Perhaps
  the non-designer people got frustrated that their power point presentations to big
  investors or something kept having font issues with everything slipping all over
  the place. For a moment as well I considered the possibility that this whole thing
  could be a massive hoax or PR stunt. Obviously not, but I was straining to find
  a logical explanation to the switch from a custom made font that echoes structure,
  stability and a little class to a basic web font. And it is a web font, I mean that
  is what it is designed for. Perhaps that\u2019s the point then, that Ikea are embracing
  new technology and throwing mother nature a bone by switching all communications
  online. Surely though they still have a need for in-store signage? Still, to me
  none of these explanations offer any logical reason.\r\n\r\nFrom a visual point
  of view there is little doubt that futura would have the upper hand over Verdana.
  Verdana is designed specifically to appear on pixels and lacks the detail, intricacy
  and subtlety of a good typeface. \u201CIt has open, wide letterforms with lots of
  space between characters to aid legibility at small sizes on screen,\u201D explains
  Simon l\u2019Anson, creative director at Made by Many, a London-based digital-consulting
  company. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t exhibit any elegance or visual rhythm when set at
  large sizes. It\u2019s like taking the family sedan off-road. It will sort of work,
  but ultimately gets bogged down.\u201D\r\n\r\nI find the argument that the switch
  is cost based a strange one. \u201CIt\u2019s more efficient and cost-effective,\u201D
  says Ikea spokeswoman Monika Gocic. \u201CPlus, it\u2019s a simple, modern-looking
  typeface.\u201D I mean surely its more expensive to switch than stay the same? And
  surely if they have a custom made version of futura, they have pretty much brought
  the rights.\r\n\r\nThe response to the whole thing has been massive. Designers worldwide
  have started petitions with numerous blogs to be found. None of which I have found
  are in favour of the switch I might add. Ikea spokes people have admitted they have
  been shocked by the whole thing. So what happens now? Will the 2011 brochure fall
  back into the arms of the ever faithful, handsome and reliable futura? After all,
  thats what happened when Coca Cola tried to change one of its trademark features.
  Before long the secret recipe was back on the shelves and the \u2018new coke\u2019
  slung into the archives of branding disasters. And that was before the digital age
  where arguments and opinions tend to spread much faster than you can put together
  an ikea table.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikeaverdana_3697.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3894020865_9e3480594c_4136.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beforeandafter_futura-vs-verdana_4877.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikea-verdana_5183.jpg]"
