  a new sign for the church. The work has taken much longer than expected, and the
  parish is trying to help him to finish. He created \u2018one-of-a-kind\u2019 letterforms
  for the name of the church, but he gave up trying to engrave them in a way that
  would meet his standards. Is there a font available that would give them an approximation
  of these letterforms? "

    your draft sign, is much closer to what I believe would be a good interpretation
    of the Orthodox Church tradition for a for a church sign in a Western country
    than the parodies found in most of the faux Old Church Slavonic fonts. If you
    have to use  a font without modification, then I suggest you look at Zamolxis

    If you can do modifications then some of the other fonts could be made more Latinized,
    by for example replacing the mirrored _R_ with an _R_ with the standard Latin
    orientation. \r\nKremlin Orthodox Church http://www.dafont.com/kremlin-orthodox-church.font?fpp=100&text=CHRISTSAVIOURORTHODOX
