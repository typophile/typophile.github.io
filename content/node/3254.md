body: I&#39;ve been lurking around the critique board for a while, and I finally decided
  to give it a try.  This is my first ever attempt, and so far I&#39;ve only completed
  the lowercase.  The weight is probably a bold, and if it&#39;s worth cleaning up,
  I&#39;d like to add a more normal weight. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t be nice. <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Well, Randy&#39;s divinity is well-documented &#40;although I&#39;d personally
    rather not learn all the details of the gory rituals Henboy performs during a
    full moon&#41;, but in my case I fear it&#39;s more a matter of invoking a daemon...
    which you have done! Mwahahahaha... <BR> <BR>As a display face, I think it&#39;s
    not interesting enough to pursue - except maybe as a learning exercise. <BR> <BR>But
    if you have technical leanings you might very well be on your way towards some
    primo uncharted territory: a font that exudes strong character at very small sizes.
    The semi-serif aspect might be key, the darkness is there, you just need to loosen
    it up and shorten the descenders. But most of all, you need to experiment with
    how exagerated curves behave at like 6 points. If you go this way, plan on spending
    some money on hi-res output though. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: That&#39;s good and bad, I guess.  I had wanted to make this a small font
    rather than a display font, but I hadn&#39;t figured on spending any money on
    it.  Hmm.  I&#39;ll try to figure something out.

  body: Well, you can get a lot of stuff on an 11x17 lino velox, and those don&#39;t
    cost a fortune. So you could save money by doing a lot of exploratory advance
    work and testing it out all at once, instead of iterating and refining gradually.
    The bad side is that you&#39;ll be doing a lot of work you&#39;ll end up dumping.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, if you go lo-fi there&#39;s a lot to learn from observing existing
    small-size fonts, especially Times Europa, Adsans, Mandel&#39;s stuff, etc. It&#39;s
    a whole dark world to itself. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
