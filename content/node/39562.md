  body: "I'd guess it may be a custom version of Monotype Grotesque, since it's pretty
    similar to Monotype's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/grotesque_display_bold_condensed/\">Grotesque
    Display</a>, which has a similar g, r and y (the r and y are much different in
    Bureau Grotesque, or Grotesque No. 9, for example). \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
