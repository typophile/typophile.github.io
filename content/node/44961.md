body: "Hi \r\n\r\nI\xB4m choosing a typeface to design a signage system. It is a Gallery
  of Art founded by John Ruskin and, I am looking at Humanists typefaces such as Johnstons,
  Eric Gills and Frutiger as well. They are easier to find.\r\n\r\nMy favourite choise
  is Bliss designed by Jeremy Tankard, do you think that I could just buy one of his
  typefaces and use a stroke in Illustrator to create a bigger weight if need it?
  This project is just to be presented at my degree. \r\n\r\nSorry for my grammar
  mistakes! and Thank you for any feedback\r\n\r\nLaura"

    able to understand my point because I am aware that my way to express myself in
    a different language is hard sometimes. \r\n\r\nSorry if I have bother to anybody\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I\xB4ve decided to choose Frutiger with a hint of Edward Jonhston\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "Laura, I would never suggest using a stroke on a typeface to add weight.
    In doing so you are ruining the original curves. Of course, some have done this
    for affect and it does work, but in this instance I think there are plenty of
    weights available that you might not need it.\r\n\r\nI forget is this for a student
    project or work? Too lazy to go back to email. ;^)\r\n\r\nBliss is a more refined
    (non-derivative), some might say, version of Gill Sans. Can you show us some of
    the work used in the exhibit or tell us more about the space, colors to be used,
    etc?"

  body: "Thanks Miss Tiffany,\r\n\r\nyeah it is for a student project and I cann\xB4t
    afford to buy the type though i\xB4ve mention Bliss and Arrival on my research
    development.\r\n\r\nThe Gallery shows Fine Art and Illustration work. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B
    (4)_6653.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0787_4863.JPG]\r\n\r\nWell,
    as you can see. They use New Gothic Font. The Wayfindin to Ruskin Gallery is just
    \"doesn\xB4t exist\". The whole university started as \"School of Art\" in 1858
    but, just recently has changed its name to Anglia Ruskin University. \r\n\r\nThis
    is one of the reasons for what I thought to give it a more personal look to the
    signage would be appropiate it.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I\xB4m trying to simplify
    this idea, make it more contemporary but with a hint of the Arts & Crafts Movement.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signage
