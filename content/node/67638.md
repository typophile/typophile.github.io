  body: "I looked for something with squarish counters and an R with the leg coming
    from near the stem. Came up with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/gnuolane/|Gnuolane]]
    by Ray Larabie.\r\n\r\nYou would need to flatten the type, or widen it, but I
    think you could look rather close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: thanks. I will give that one a try. I was using aharoni because of its proximity
    to what i thought it could be and going from there. Appreciate the response.
