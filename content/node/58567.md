  is the glyph a lot of magazines tend to end their articles with?\r\n\r\nMost tend
  to use a square, while some spruce it up with their own inventions, but from a typographer's
  point of view, what exactly are they? A quirky idea or an ancient typographic convention?"

  body: FWIW, our publishing company calls them "end bugs." We use everything from
    a simple square to a miniature version of  the magazine's or client's logo.

    symbol or halmos (after Paul Halmos, who popularised its use to mark the end of
    a proof). Some authors use a different mark for proofs by contadiction (I personally
    draw a lightning bolt, but a filled square is probably more common)."

  body: "<cite>Wikipedia calls it a tombstone.</cite>\r\n\r\nI doubt Wikipedia ever
    worked in editorial design. \r\n\r\nI worked in magazines for years, and never
    heard it called a tombstone. End mark was the term most commonly heard, that and
    occasionally \"bug\"\r\n\r\nYes Kent, I think I have confused the cubs by using
    the copy editors mark that indicates \"the end\". But I always left it in the
    ms. when I sent the spec to the type shop, and they always knew to replace it
    with our end mark"

    and magazine work was also used as a term for an advertisement that appeared regularly
    in issue after issue, with no changes. The form would be put away as each issue
    was killed, and hauled out for the next. After much repeated use the type might
    be re-set, but exactly as it looked earlier.\r\n\r\npowers"
