  body: This was embossed in Photoshop. Check the way the lines merge sloppily on
    the crossbar of the E. Look at the curves on the rest of the E. When hunting for
    an embossed font, keep in mind that TrueType, Postscript and OpenType are limited
    to pure black and white - no gray except dots, lines etc.
