  science company; I was wondering if someone knows if the new OT-Pro version contains
  Greek mathematical glyphs like delta, pi or mu?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nKTKM\r\n"

  body: These are part of the basic character set, so even the standard <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/regular/charmap.html?refby=typographica">Akzidenz-Grotesk
    BQ</a> has those characters. What the Pro version adds is Eastern European, Turkish,
    and Baltic character sets, as well as small caps and figure alts (oldstyle/lining,
    fractions) rolled into one font per style.
