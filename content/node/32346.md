  developed in FontLab. The others are part developed in Illustrator. \r\n\r\nI am
  looking to develop a famous foundry by producing the highest quality fonts. I want
  to partner with a developer that holds high standards for themselves and their work
  and has the highest attention to detail.\r\n\r\nI own and run a design company and
  do not have enough time to design and develop the fonts. I have found the development
  of fonts a steep learning curve and can appreciate the skill needed to develop fonts.
  I have good experience in business and marketing and have high ambitions for the
  foundry I want to build. \r\n\r\nI look forward to any serious inquiries, comments
  or advice.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\nwww.jamestrump.com\r\n\r\n"

  body: No, Gotham and Avenir are not anywhere near this similar. "Rhona Gillmore"
    could be recreated in any program that can horizontally scale type, starting with
    Peignot Light.

    body: "Yes I agree. With these characters it does look like an extended Peignot
      Light. \r\nAlthough, when you see the other characters it starts to look very
      different. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion Peignot is almost a very nice typeface. It
      has some very elegant characters, others look ugly. I intend to create a new
      font simular to Peignot but elegant throughout. "

  body: James there are production guns for hire. You should google it. I have ran
    into several of them, so they excist. The cost of developing a small family could
    be very high though. Designing, producing and testing is a very time consuming
    full-time job. We're talking months here. Best of luck.

  body: "Are you willing to pay somebody up-front to \"manufacture\" the fonts for
    you? If not, this is only likely to work out if the fonts are exceptional (tough
    call) and you settle on some profit-sharing scheme. There are too many fonts out
    there, at low prices, for it to be otherwise.\r\n\r\n> I intend to create a new
    font simular to Peignot but elegant throughout.\r\n\r\nThere are possibly legal,
    and certainly ethical, complications when doing something like this. Excoffon,
    a contemporary of Cassandre once did the same sort of thing to Peignot early on
    (by some accounts even before Peignot was officially released) and the uproar
    was a trigger for the creation of ATypI.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, concerning Peignot
    in particular, it's important to note that it was much more than just another
    font - in essence it was actually an attempt to reform the Latin script. As a
    result, any \"taming\" of it (presuming that's what you've done - maybe not) involves
    complications beyond merely the formal.\r\n\r\nNot trying to be confrontational,
    just trying to help.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
