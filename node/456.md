  of TV ads here in the Pacific NW &#40;USA&#41;. The title of the campaign is something
  like &#34;June Selldown&#34;. I&#39;ve only seen the TV ads, and I&#39;m not quick
  enough to tape the ads on the VCR.  <BR> <BR>The font is a slab-serif -- the serifs
  are blocky, almost square. The type flashes by very quickly, so the only other thing
  I can describe is the crossbar on the A is very low, resting just above the serifs.
  <BR> <BR>It goes by so quick I&#39;m not sure I like the font or not, but I&#39;d
  be interested in looking at a specimen ... if I can figure out what it is?!? <BR>
  <BR>Has anyone else seen the ads? Thx!'

  body: Based on the sample given, the best I can come up with so far is T26&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/compressor/">Compressor Slab Serif</a>.
    The combination of slab serif and the E missing the serifs on top right and bottom
    right, as well as the V appearing to have only outside serifs, ought to give it
    away, but I can&#39;t find it. Maybe it&#39;s a custom face for Toyota?

    horribly compressed. Sorry &#39;bout that. It took me a while to find the graphic:
    it&#39;s not on toyota.com, but buyatoyota.com. Go figure. <BR> <BR>Apparently
    the sale is only in Portland. That&#39;s why nobody else saw it ... or maybe it&#39;s
    just that I&#39;m the only one who watches TV any more? <BR> <BR>I like the font!
    The usage in the comercial made it look a little wierd. Thanks again.'
