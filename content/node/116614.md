  body: I know the Acne Jeans logo [[http://fontsinuse.com/uses/3368/the-other-times-modern|used
    to be based on a typeface called Times Modern]] that has not been digitised, and
    since has become a customised piece of lettering. The other two typefaces (all
    three are distinct, btw.) I don't know, but I'm sure someone will help presently.

  body: Third one is a bit hard to tell (small size, difficult angle), but it could
    be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/%28caslon+graphique%29/fonts/|Caslon Graphique]].
    Except that doesn't have an italic...
