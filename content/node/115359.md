  for the screen? \r\n\r\nI am interested in work-horse typefaces for body text that
  I can purchase the rights to use with @font-face, so that would exclude all the
  offerings from those wonderful subscription based services. I have found the results
  from type at MyFonts can be spotty, and they never say if a font has been hinted
  by the designer. \r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest your own work. I am interested in
  expanding my knowledge of good work that is out there. Thanks very much."

  body: "Thanks nina & hrant. Webtype, Web Ink, Typekit, CloudTypography all have
    exceptional work. I have not explored fonts.com that much, but their new eText
    revivals of classic faces look gorgeous\u2014I have used Sabon a lot in print.\r\n\r\nI
    have great admiration for the Font Bureau\u2019s work, especially the RE series
    for screens. Perusing the Font Bureau\u2019s catalog makes me wish I had a lot
    more money to play with. Whenever a typeface gives me a thrill in a magazine it
    is inevitably from one of a few foundries/designers. Font Bureau typefaces are
    like going to ballet, everything looks effortless and makes me feel like I could
    be a type designer too...but that\u2019s the grand illusion, right?\r\n\r\nSo,
    yes. I am looking for something other than subscription services for myself...but
    I still love to look at what\u2019s out there and will probably recommend subscriptions
    to freelance clients when the project suits it."

  body: "Thanks hrant. Yes, it might be better to approach my question through identifying
    foundries, designers and quality resellers that have @font-face licenses and trusted
    attention to hinting. I know that <a href=\"https://commercialtype.com/\">Commercial
    Type</a>, <a href=\"http://vllg.com/\">Village</a>, <a href=\"http://processtypefoundry.com/\">Process
    Type</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typesupply.com/\">Type Supply</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/\">FontShop</a>/<a
    href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/\">FontFont</a> offer this. Klim does too, but
    those are priced dearly. Any others you would suggest?\r\n\r\nAre FontFont and
    FontShop the same company? I think they are a really great options for what I
    am looking for. I wish their website was easier to filter out their webfonts (a
    massive catalogue) and see samples of them in use rather than PDFs and images.
    The new releases like FF Mark are an exception with really stellar micro-sites
    that blow my mind. FF Kievit is another example with a great micro-site.\r\n\r\nFont
    Spring and MyFonts have @font-face\u2014though MyFonts is increasingly having
    pay-as-you-go licenses. Font Spring has some of the largest per-views licenses
    and often has the lowest prices for what you get. They license the work of some
    designers whose work is obviously well crafted like that of Nick Shinn, Hannes
    von D\xF6hren and Mark Simonson. My MS Windows emulator that I use for testing
    IE (I\u2019m a Mac fanboy) oddly does not work for the Font Spring demo page (it
    defaults to Arial). Ironic, because IE is always the lowest common denominator
    and the whole reason for testing. So, I don\u2019t trust that those unfamiliar
    designs  are carefully hinted. For example, Trade Gothic FS would be quite useful,
    but how\u2019s the quality?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m an institutional web designer and
    we\u2019ve no budget for fonts beyond the Open Sans and Georgia chosen (by the
    powers that be) as our web identity fonts. So, I like to buy an occasional web
    font license with my own money so that I can become familiar with it through use.
    I\u2019m partly hoping that I can one day earn some freelance money designing
    with it and it\u2019s partly because I\u2019m an obsessive font geek who spends
    evenings looking through specimens (to the chargin of my girlfriend). \r\n\r\nI
    am willing to pay for premium well designed typefaces, but obviously there is
    only so much I can afford out of pocket. I feel that I am getting more value as
    a sharp-shooter with only six bullets a year when I buy @font-face licenses. My
    hands get sweaty. I recognize the fairness of use-based-fees and subscriptions
    for the laborious and creative work that type designers do. Nonetheless, I am
    just glad that I didn\u2019t have to pay a per-project fee for every print job
    I\u2019ve done. Perhaps when WOFF becomes standard, the pricing rates for web
    designers and fairness to type designers will even-out.\r\n\r\n...but I\u2019ve
    gone off topic now. Any stellar text web fonts you like besides the well-known
    Proxima Nova, Brandon Text, Museo Sans, etc...?"

  body: "Thanks for the link, Nick! Your typeface, Richler, is new to me. That is
    exactly the kind of suggestion I was looking for in this discussion.\r\n\r\nEmanuel,
    Ha! Yes they certainly get the award for the most ballsy use of yellow. Fonts
    with a splash of <em>danger</em> (Carlos Danger? Do you watch John Stewart? I
    hear the music now). Seriously, it is nice to see them make a new site that focuses
    on their web font offerings with actual samples of the fonts in use (rather than
    images/pdfs FontShop currently has). As well, FontShop has @font-face licenses
    with way more page views (<em>10 times more</em>) than MyFont\u2019s standard.
    \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nMyFonts gives you half-off the second type of  font  you purchase,
    if you purchase both the web and print at the same time. However, you have to
    buy them at the same time and can\u2019t come back and get the discount later.
    Commercial Type let\u2019s you get the discounts anytime...many foundries do this
    individually on request (e.g., Klim does), but Commercial is one of the few that
    I have seen that make it so easy at check-out time to get the discount. Commercial\u2019s
    approach makes me willing to buy a style or two to test out the face and get familiar
    with it\u2019s character through use...a slow process for me.\r\n\r\nI recently
    purchased a license for a couple of styles of <em>Lyon</em> from Commercial Type
    and I really like the way they have their site set-up. They give discounts for
    bulk/family purchases, allow easy upgrades, and allow @font-face with perpetual
    licenses. I have a <strong>big crush</strong> on Lyon right now, unassuming and
    dignified as a text face with a lovely flare in the italics."
