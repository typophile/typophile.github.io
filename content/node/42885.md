  myfonts, WTF, identifont, scrolled through many dozens of typefaces and I can't
  figure this one out. I wonder if it was custom-made, or some sort of old typeface
  that's just not used any more.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, this logo/crest might be
  from the 1920s! I want to recreate it, but the interlocking characters would be
  difficult to recreate by hand, although I just might do it if I can't find the right
  typeface...\r\n\r\nWhat do you think this is??"

    probably not THAT hard to reproduce, eh? I'd just redraw it (or, when faced with
    an ugly, analog, outdated logo, perhaps this is time to pitch them on the idea
    of rebranding)\r\n"

    with them and thought I could simply type out some text.\r\n\r\nNo way they'd
    do a rebranding! :D\r\nThis is for an old country club; steeped in its old ways;
    full of tradition. They're not looking for new members, really, as they're already
    at maximum capacity."
