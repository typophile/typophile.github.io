  top left serif on the capital letter A anywhere. The closest that I've found is
  Kepler Standard. The printer has the file but will not give it up so I'm going to
  recreate the text for a client. Sorry, this is the biggest image size the printer
  will give up.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/atc_text_only_3542.jpg]"
