  3+, Safari, Opera, IE9. I'm a designer with some front-end skills, but I must admit
  my typography expertise might not be up to par with what I'm trying to achieve here.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I need from you: perform the kerning, compare it to my version, and if you think
  that your version is better than mine, click on the yellow link and a popup will
  be displayed with a code that will help me correct it. Post it here and I will be
  eternally grateful. Using the keyboard is the fastest way of getting the job done,
  if you are short on time.\r\n\r\nNote to type designers: I'd be honored to showcase
  your work. Just send me an .ai file with your properly kerned word converted to
  curves. Just send me an e-mail to mark@duopixel.com with the file and the name,
  author, year of release and the corresponding links.\r\n\r\nThe link is:\r\n[[http://type.method.ac|http://type.method.ac]]\r\n\r\nSidenote:
  I'm not sure KernType is the right name, perhaps TrackType would be a more appropriate
  term?"

  body: The game is about spacing rather than kerning or tracking, no? So maybe SpaceType
    is more appropriate.

  body: "It's beautifully made, Mark. Well done.\r\n\r\nKerning is a measure of the
    space between a specific pair of letters.\r\nTracking is a measure of the overall
    tightness or looseness of a word, line, or paragraph.\r\n\r\nLike others have
    said, this is more aptly named SpaceType or FitType because the player adjusts
    the sidebearings of each letter to get an evenly spaced word."

    hours, so now I'm hesitating changing the name. I've been getting a lot of conflicting

    suggestion that is very close to Vicke's.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've been playing with this and enjoying it. The one issue I have as far
    as what is ideal concerns kerning the caps to lower case. Because caps are bigger
    and have more internal white space, I feel that it is better to give a little
    more white space between the caps and lower case than between two lower case letters.
    The game seems to go more toward equalizing all the spaces, so that the caps to
    lower case is tighter than what I would do. I realize that this is debatable,
    but I remember noting that Igino Marini of iKern also mentioned that he came to
    the same conclusion, and modified his program in this respect. \r\n\r\nI'd be
    interested in what others think about this issue. \r\n\r\nI realize there also
    might be a difference on what is ideal, depending on whether one is dealing with
    a one or two word title, or the goal is caps with lower case for running text. "

  body: "I agree with you Bill, with regards to the built-in kerning (\"metrics\")
    of fonts, which is optimized for small (\"text\") size settings.\r\n\r\nBut if
    one is going to concentrate this hard on kerning a word of display type, then
    manual kerning is the order of the day, and there are several different aesthetic
    models which one may follow, including the classic \"tight but not touching\":\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type_5555.png]\r\n\r\nRather
    than one button for \"correct\" kerning, it would be interesting to have several
    buttons, showing different kerning methods, or how particular typographers would
    kern the word in question.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, without reference to a specific
    document, it's really not possible to be precise about what kind of kerning is
    appropriate, because there are very few one word documents. For this document
    (the game page), the tracking, or letterspacing, is way too open, making it impossible
    to do proper kerning. For the one word \"Type\" in this layout, I would space
    the word as shown above.\r\n\r\nBTW, this is Adobe Garamond, redesigned by Robert
    Slimbach, published in 1988, if I'm not mistaken. So it would be better to credit
    the original publisher <em>and</em> the redesigner, as in the FontBook."

    never understood that approach. It seems like a relic of metal type and it has
    always bothered me that it continues in contemporary fonts. The goal of proper
    spacing is an even tone. To me, this method distracts."

  body: "Stephen, the concept is indeed to get even color, an even density of gray.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, when you test kerning of caps and lowercase in extended text,
    it becomes clear that it is not possible to get the same density of gray with
    caps and lower case. The caps have more open space in them, and also a different
    structure as they are more closed above the x-height. \r\n\r\nColor is not only
    the space between letters, but also within letters. So you can shove a cap next
    to a lower case latter, with the same space as between two lower case letters,
    but you still aren't going to have even color. In fact, the color between the
    cap and lower case is going to be more uneven, compared to the cap itself if you
    kern it tighter. So it makes sense to do something between what you'd do for an
    all caps setting, and what you'd do between two lower case letters.    \r\n\r\nThe
    reality is that you can't completely cover up the origin of caps and lower case
    as different alphabets, with different structure and color. And in facing this
    you realize that in fact that there is an advantage to caps to be a little different
    in color to serve their function of marking sentence beginnings, proper names,
    and so on. So it is not a matter of being stuck with metal standards, it is a
    matter of being stuck with\u2014or taking advantage of\u2014a script that mixes
    two different alphabets. \r\n\r\nThe history that created this problem was pre-printing,
    in the humanist scribes of the early 15th century. You had people like Bayer who
    wanted to revert to unicase, which would enable you to get more even color. But
    it never caught on, probably because the signaling function of caps is in fact
    useful for communication. So the reality is that you either have to go the direction
    of Bayer, or accept the fact that kerning will always involve compromise. \r\n\r\nNow
    this question is complicated by the fact that if you have smaller, narrower, lighter
    caps, you can kern them closer, and get more overall even color. But you also
    lose something in having the caps not so prominent, as they become a little less
    functional as markers. So the question of how best to kern is bound up with the
    overall design concept of the typeface.  \r\n\r\nIn any case, you really only
    get very similar color from caps and lower case when they are small caps. In fact,
    sameness of color is one of the purposes of making small caps in the first place.
    That reality of the function of small caps I think clinches the case that you
    just aren't going to be able to get the same color in words that mix full caps
    and lower case. \r\n\r\nSo I would say that noticeable caps are, within limits
    (it can be overdone, like everything), not \"distracting,\" but usefully signaling
    information to the reader.\r\n\r\nNow as Nick, who agrees with me on kerning for
    running text, points out, what you do in display is a different question. There
    it becomes a question of what works with that combination of letters, in that
    font, in that situation on the page. And there are different ways you can go.
    \ \r\n\r\nThis brings up another issue, but related, which is that you can't kern
    for every situation when designing a font. Essentially, all you can do is kern
    for all caps, and caps to lower case for extended text. I think the sensitive
    typographer is always going to need to kern titles for best effect\u2014and redraw
    the letters for a wordmark, as Doyald Young was a master of. It just can't be
    built into the font. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate the futility of trying to get completely
    even color in kerning caps to lower case, consider trying to get the whole of
    the following sentence to have even color: \r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century,
    P. G. Woodhouse and W. Somerset Maughm were successful playwrights.   \r\n\r\nSee
    what I mean?      "
