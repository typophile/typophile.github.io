body: "In the course of the XIX th century, there were two countries that launched
  the new production of sans serif typefaces: England and Germany. The most famous
  German foundry was Liepzig-based <strong>Schelter und Giesecke</strong> which gave
  grotesk typefaces from 1825. Other German foundries like <strong>Berthod</strong>
  and <strong>Stempel</strong> will produce grotesks but at the end of the century.\r\n\r\nThe
  only references of <strong>S&G</strong> grotesks belonged to the last quarter of
  the XIX th century: <em>Schelter Grotesk, Schlanke Grotesk, Breite Grotesk</em>.\r\nDesigner
  Nick Curtis attempted to reproduce the style of these typefaces.\r\n\r\n1. Is there
  any leads to pinpoint the very first German grotesks from 1825?\r\n2. Is there any
  book dedicated to the <strong>Schelter und Giesecke</strong> foundry?\r\n"

    in the 1886 specimen book of the Schelter & Giesecke foundry in Leipzig."

    called thin condensed or light condensed.\r\nWithin the context of German type
    terminology around 1900, Breit is the formal opposite of Schlank, it can be translated
    as wide or broad. Today one would call such a face bold extended. Some of the
    typefaces that used to be called Breit, are wider than the extended typefaces
    of today. Many foundries did not use the word \u2018normal\u2019. Instead, type
    could be called either mager (regular) or fett (bold), or either schlank (thin
    condensed) or breit (bold or bold extended). And then of course there is breit
    mager, which would now be light or regular extended. \r\nOr what do you mean by
    idiosyncrasy? "
