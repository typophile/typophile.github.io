  for a serif typeface to complement Trade Gothic.  I've tried Glypha, but I find
  it a bit ugly in long stretches of text. Any suggestions?"

  body: Luke, are you looking for a serif face for body copy? Is it a magazine, newspaper?
    Tell us a bit more about your project, and the audience. That will help narrow
    down the suggestions.

  body: "Honestly, I think it would probably be harder to find a serif that doesn\u2019t
    look hot next to Trade Gothic. That just-on-the-edge-on-neogrotesqueness of Trade
    Gothic makes it like DIN; you can stick it next to anything and they\u2019ll either
    sing together or create some quirky relationship that brings out all of the eye
    candy in both faces. Don\u2019t worry about the details, just treat Trade like
    the streets of Vegas where the whores\u2019 charms come out and they all look
    good.\r\n\r\n\u2022Try using it with HTF Didot and constantly invert the hierarchy
    so that you get the best of both worlds by working the type at different faces.\r\n\u2022Work
    it against those sweet brush strokes in Dolly.\r\n\u2022Set all of the text in
    some really sweet Slimbach italic or Cataneo to build an extreme contrast into
    the hierarchy. "

  body: "Chris, it's for a large body of text, somewhere between magazine and newspaper
    (newspaper articles reduced to magazine format - a bit like The Week magazine).
    And thanks for your suggestions James; I have a feeling you're a passionate Trade
    Goth ...  \r\nI like Didot, but find it a bit 'fussy' and ostentatious for text.
    I can see what you're saying about Dolly - but unfortunately money's a problem.
    \ What do you folks reckon about Kepler or Utopia?\r\n\r\nThanks heaps - this
    is awesome!\r\n"
