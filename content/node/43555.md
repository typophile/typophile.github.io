  talking body font, I have already found the funnest headline font. It needs to be
  legible, versatile and FUN [did I mention that already?].\r\n\r\nHere are some that
  I have turned down:\r\n\r\nAmerican Typewriter: Already used by Butt magazine.\r\n\r\nComic
  Sans: No italic version. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? \r\n\r\nCome on people, let's
  find the funnest font out there. Best suggestion wins a whole load of fun; don't
  ask me how. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Careful. Back in the Seventies, when <em>National Lampoon</em> magazine switched
    from boring fonts (Century Schoolbook for text and Times Extra Bold for headlines)
    to "funny" fonts (Cooper Oldstyle for text and Gill Sans Extra Bold for headlines),
    it became less funny. It's like when a comedian laughs at their own jokes. I think
    the deadpan approach is usually better, though I suppose it depends on the type
    of humor.

    I'm just saying that it's the audience (or the readers) who should be laughing,
    not the performer (or the type). And, for that matter, I've never seen a typeface
    that made me laugh out loud. At least not because it \"looked funny.\" The only
    time I can remember a typeface making me laugh is when I received a direct mail
    come-on personally addressed to me in my own handwriting (<a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html\">Felt
    Tip Roman</a>)."

    because it epitomizes the whole stupid notion of a fun font, so much so that you
    can't help but laugh at it. And I feel a little bit like a broken record on this
    one, because I've stood up for it many times before here on Typophile: Dr. Suess
    singlehandedly made Century Schoolbook the funnest font of all time.\r\n\r\nAnd

    the book about Yugoslavia but you got me: the content isn't all that light hearted.
    It's still fun though. I'm not sure that I agree on the whole comedian laughing
    at their own joke thing; I think that the typography should reflect the tone of
    voice or in this case complement it. Having said that, some of the funniest things
