    for USC&#41; will again be teaching his letterpress class at the ArtCenter in
    Pasadena &#40;at the new &#34;wind-tunnel&#34; location&#41;. It&#39;s 14 weeks
    of some serious type and cylinder press printing. Gerald is as fun as he&#39;s
    educational, and even though I took the class about a year ago, I still feel the
    new insight into old type trickling down to me almost every day. The stuff you
    realize when actually holding metal type in your hand, putting the sorts in the
    stick and not to mention rolling the paper on the inked form, can actually put
    a smile on your face. BTW, it starts in mid-May, and there&#39;s a limit of ten
    students per semester. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
