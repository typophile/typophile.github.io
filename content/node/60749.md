  body: "Ok, please take comments with a dose of salt...I'm also a beginner.\r\nA
    needs a hair less weight on the left diagonal for optical balance with the right
    side. \r\nB and C are great. D I think looks heavier on the right than on the
    left. \r\nE may be a notch too wide. \r\nG: I think the bottom corner should move
    down a bit and I'd think about a longer crossbar.\r\nThe serifs on I look a bit
    wide, perhaps that was intentional?\r\nK: the top arm looks heavier than the bottom...thin
    it slightly?\r\nThe contrast on M looks reversed and it's quite narrow overall.\r\nN
    normally has a slightly heavier join at the top than at the bottom to keep the
    weight optically centred.\r\nO and P are lovely.\r\nQ looks narrow (is it the
    same as O?) and needs more counterspace. The bar needs to move right too, I think.\r\nThe
    leg of R starts a bit too close to the stem and the counterspace underneath it
    seems oppressed by the counterspace to its right.\r\nS is pretty nice, but may
    be slightly wide?\r\nV and Y might have the same trouble as A. The right diagonal
    should be slightly thinner (just a few units)\r\nW: see M.\r\nDid you take some
    weight off 7? It still looks heavy.\r\nI'm not sure about the taper on the hat
    of 1...the terminals everywhere else are the same width as the strokes.\r\nOverall
    this is looking very neat. Nice. :)\r\n"

  body: "Thanks! I'll look into these over the weekend.\r\n\r\nYes, the I is intentionally
    wide. These letters all go within circles, and it seemed like the I needed to
    be a little wider than normal to fill up the circle a little more. (I didn't post
    how these look inside the circles because I wanted the comments to focus on the
    shape of the letters).\r\n\r\nSome of the other width issues (like the narrow
    M and W) also have to do with these letters going inside of circles. I wanted
    to give them a little room within the circle. If I ever use these letters as the
    basis for a normal typeface, I'll definitely need to address those issues. Once
    I get these letters cleaned up more, I'll post a version showing them within their
    circles.\r\n\r\nI did trim down the 7, but I'm thinking that the 7 in the PDF
    file I posted is not the trimmed down one. I'll look into that.\r\n\r\nGood catch
    on the Q. I thought I had used my most recent O as the basis for the Q, but I
    didn't.\r\n\r\nI'm glad the S didn't ring any alarms. That's my least favorite
    character to draw.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean about the contrast of the
    M being reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

  body: "I've posted an updated version the original post.\r\n\r\nI think I now get
    your comment about the M and W. My previous version had them symmetrical, like
    Helvetica Neue, but I've adjusted them a bit so they follow the same pattern as
    Univers."

  body: ">I\u2019m not sure what you mean about the contrast of the M being reversed.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    not very accurate language. I meant that the left diagonal needs to be heavier
    than the right one for optical balance, and it looked the other way round. I think
    you've cracked it anyway now. It's all looking really neat :)\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if you might make the strokes of A slightly slightly narrower near the apex. I'm
    guessing the eye expects the base to be slightly weightier to not look top heavy.
    It'd just be a matter of a couple of units probably and I'd open the counter's
    top to make a tiny trap there to achieve that I think. The crossbar might withstand
    moving down a tiddly fraction but I'm being very picky now!\r\n\r\nRight side
    of P may need to be slightly wider. Compare it next to O and the stroke looks
    thinner. R possibly too.\r\n\r\nD may be slightly wide but my eyes are starting
    to play tricks from looking at this so minutely. Anyway I think the widths are
    fixed by the circles you need.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take this further, set some
    text and it'll be easier to see any inconsistencies, but it is looking pretty
    well made as it is.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: The round sides of D, O, Q are way heavy. C, G, not as much so, but still
    a little.
