  body: Ramon - No idea what the font is. Honestly this looks like it was probably
    custom-drawn.  If its just the logo you need to recreate, it probably wouldn't
    take more than a couple minutes to trace it.

    that the people who made it simply been using a default font for it.\r\n\r\nBut
    in case I can't find the font soon, there's no other option than to trace it.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your reply."
