body: Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right forum for my font, but it seemed the right
  choice. I developed two variants. In the regular one, glyphs connect to each other
  only in specific locations. In the C(onnected even more) version, some connections
  were added, some possible ones were still left out, though (like the /o), because
  I didn't want to mess with it and wanted to maintain a more natural flow iynwim.
  (And for another reason, I don't have the right tools to implement OpenType goodies
  and all). And the excuse for keeping some letters separated that I came up with
  for myself was that this way it looked more alien, rugged and original. Of course
  talking like this is a dead end, but let me know if for a second you hesitated about
  sharing this view (see the word Gra-vi-ty at the end of the Connexion.pdf file).
