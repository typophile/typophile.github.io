  CS3, created a new document, and using the glyph pallet, put in \"Alpha\" \"gamma\"
  then a space, then \"gamma\" \"eta\" using our version of the Greek Font Society
  Olga (GFSOlga.otf) font. The kern feature for the GFSOlga font says \"Latin\". The
  kern feature for our version has no language tag at all -- the kern values are just
  entered. But with our version, the kerning values in the features do in fact appear
  in the little CS3 test document.\r\n\r\nThen I checked the foundry GFS font (with
  the \"Latin\" tag). It too worked. Now this is just a new document without any paragraph
  or characters styles, is that the issue (We're still using CS2 in production).\r\n\r\nWhy
  can't I get the problem mentioned in the earlier thread?\r\n\r\n"

    The problem arises when you select the text as Greek the kerning does not show
    up unless all the locl feature tags are in place.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Well, the font does not need any \"locl feature tags\". It just needs languagesystems
    to be defined for all scripts present in the font. But Chris is right, the problem
    manifests itself when you assign a certain language for a certain text -- for
    example, if you mark some font set in Cyrillic as \"Russian\", it will then use
    the OpenType features registered under the \"cyrl\" tag. \r\n\r\nA."
