    'Dover books' section where you'll find all sorts of books full of scanable clip
    art based on old engravings like this. \r\n\r\nOnline, you can check out the Briar
    Press's archive:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.briarpress.org/cuts"

    Pointe]] includes a set of outlined, shaded and silhouette pointing hands. I think
    your image is a graphic, not a font ornament.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
