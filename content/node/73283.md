  that GM and Dodge used for their instrument clusters (and all over the cars). My
  searches are usually flooded with those psychedelic '60s fonts when I use the keyword
  \"60s\".\r\n\r\nAny close matches out there?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    at midcentury wound up working on instrumentation in the US auto industry? Maybe
    [[http://typophile.com/node/12602|Stuart Sandler]] would know?\r\n\r\nAt any rate,
    if you just want something similar, something like Alternate Gothic or a condensed
    form of Trade Gothic could work. "
