  body: "The more I look at it the more I think it's a custom job (part of the obvious
    oblique cuts on finals of course) based on [[http://myfonts.us/td-XkYsZX|Eurostile]]
    (Extended Black), mainly beacause of the \"HULK HOGAN\" part which looks very
    close (even matching) to Eurostile. \"Just\" need to recreate some letters: /S
    (probably the \"hardest\") with /O or /C (keeping the top left quarter, extending
    it horizontally to the right, 180\xB0 mirrored to create the bottom part and connecting
    the all thing with a horizontal stroke), /A with /P (have a closer look to this
    one and you'll see the bowl's inside top right curve is not identical to the left
    one as it should be for a \"regular\" top rounded /A as this one) and /R with
    (also) /P (as it looks like /P with an additional leg).\r\nSome more \"to-customize\"/base/similar
    fonts you might like: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/saturn/|Saturn]]
    (same base as Eurostile with a top rounded /A), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/psyops/armchair-modern-ot-agauge/|Armchair
    Modern]], [[http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron|Orbitron]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/stainless/ext-black/|Stainless
    Extended Black]]"

  body: "Again thank you for extensive answer i know the top one was Eurostile and
    properly the rest is custom made, you're right on that i think. I really like
    your example fonts: Saturn and Armchair Modern are very cool more fonts that i
    wished i had :-)\r\n\r\nThank you"
