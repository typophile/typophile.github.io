body: I&#39;m sure that this has been asked before..but I couldn&#39;t find the answer
  in the archives..I think that this might be a custom font/logo...but what font comes
  close to being the one that Louis Vuitton&#39;s uses? I&#39;ve been told that it
  could be Futura Book or Century Gothic Book. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66931.gif"
