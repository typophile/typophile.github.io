body: "I'm doing a small 2 page report with a lot of text and I wanted to use a Humanist
  Slab Serif. I've tried PMN Caecilia and ITC Officina Serif, Caecilia has a rather
  large x-height and loose tracking, where Officina has a smaller x-height and rather
  condensed feel. Is there a similar font that would fall somewhere in between these
  two?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions will do."

    with the way it sets. (Some people don't like the Q.)

    and several widths\r\nChaparral: more organic, more readable, size and weight
    options, good contrast for reading\r\nAmasis: somewhat organic, like Caecilia
    but softer, more contrast, some bracketing"

    Linotype Aptifer, FF Olsen ...\r\n\r\nBTW, terminology refinement: you want the
    sheared wedge style,\r\nnot the pointy wedge one (AKA \"Latin\"), which looks
    too self-assured.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don't know Hrant, these seem pretty stiff. I do like FF Page Serif though
    it (as weird as this will sound) might be too elegant. If this document wasn't
    just a working data report and was geared as marketing,   I'd definitely be buying
    Page Serif. I'm putting that one on my wish list though.\r\n\r\nI think I'm going
    to go with The Serif. I do appreciate all the suggestions. The collective brain
    trust definitely had some good ones. \r\n\r\nI'll even make a suggestion: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/placebo-serif/\">Placebo
    Serif</a>"

    It has a very charming quality too it. I don't know if that's a good thing, it
    might not be the body copy workhorse I'd need. \r\n\r\nAccording to Myfonts, Silica
    doesn't have any italics."

  body: In terms of tracking for Caecilia, what about just tightening it up in the
    layout software?  I'm doing that in a test document and it looks OK (better than
    the default), but maybe I'm missing something?
