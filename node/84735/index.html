  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a serif with the same qualities of Archer. I will admit that I prefer a sans-serif over a serif. Something about the majority of serif fonts makes me feel like I need to arch my back and keep my chin up. I feel like wine and cheese would be served at a serif party while the sans-serif party would have an open bar with a stellar selection of craft beer.</p>
<p>And then there is &ldquo;Archer&rdquo;, which for me conveys a warmth and friendliness other serifs lack. It says &ldquo;welcome, have a seat and make yourself comfortable&rdquo;. Yet the font exudes elegance and sophistication at the same time.</p>
<p>Archer has been popping up everywhere for a while. I see it in lots of magazine and ad campaigns. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when Publix (grocery store in the southeast) used it for their most recent campaign. However I wasn&rsquo;t really ready to find it gracing the title of every Ore-Ida potato product in the frozen food section there. Two days later . . . Quaker Oatmeal.</p>
<p>My point: as a designer and lover of type, I like to keep things fresh. I can&rsquo;t create a logo for a cutting-edge, sophisticated interior designer using the Ore-Ida potato font that is easily spotted in so many common places.</p>
<p>Is there another well-designed font family capable of pulling off all of the same qualities of archer? Can there be another font with such lovely ball terminals that succeeds without coming across as a knock-off? I thought I found the answer a while back in House Industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eames Century Modern&rdquo;. But somehow I never feel as satisfied when using it in designs or copy in which I want to exude friendliness and a bit of personality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to typophile and would love to get your suggestions and feedback. I did a keyword search for &ldquo;archer&rdquo; before posting and didn&rsquo;t find anything of interest. So please, don&rsquo;t bite if this has been discussed in a previous post/s. (pretend I added a smiley face here using punctuation)</p>
<p>I often have imaginative conversations and sometimes documented dialogues with fonts as if they are human. If you don&rsquo;t find this disturbing I might share the break-up letter I drafted for Archer.</p>

<p>Frank, I&rsquo;m not crazy about the way Sentinel reads when used in sentence and paragraph form. I&rsquo;m sure there is a technical word for that but you will have to excuse me as I am a self-taught designer with an English Literature degree.</p>
<p>eliason . . . Bodoni Egyptian. That&rsquo;s it. I never thought about looking for a slab serif with a feminine side. I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to slab serifs for their clean and simple lines. But I never thought one could look so good in paragraph form. I like the fact that it is slightly condensed, as I feel like I am often in need of a more condensed font in order to lend more of my beloved white space. And equally important, it doesn&rsquo;t come across as an archer knock-off.</p>
<p>The lightest version is especially nice. Thank you, thank you!</p>

<p>The problem is not the amount of use but amount of entirely inappropriate usage. Archer is fine for the many places where a cute and quirky slab serif is called for. But it can look ridiculous when used outside of those places. Two insane uses that spring to mind were a tank-themed Cheetos web campaign and the new identity for Wells Fargo retail banks. Archer is far from the only misused fonts, it just seems that way because H&amp;FJ&rsquo;s great marketing efforts make it easily identifiable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I guess it&rsquo;s obvious how much I know about typography classification and terminology- I wasn&rsquo;t even classifying Archer as a slab serif- just a serif with ball terminals. I think of Lubalin Graph and Rockwell when I think of a slab serif.</p>
<p>Nick, I am in agreement with your statement. That is why I&rsquo;ve rarely used archer in all caps- there&rsquo;s never enough of those lovely ball terminals to leave me satisfied.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way I see archer bold used that bothers me but this is probably a personal preference of style.</p>
<p>Bree is nice but a little feminine for my taste.</p>
<p>So are most of the people in here typographers/aspiring typographers?</p>
