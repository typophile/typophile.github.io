  body: "Santiago, good job of balancing the multiple concepts which inform this design.\r\nWhat's
    next, Bold or Italic -- or something quite different?\r\n\r\nNice use of hendiadys,
    Riccardo, but I'm not sure the antithetical conjunction \"yet\" is quite correct,
    \"and\" would have sufficed.\r\n"

  body: Nick, thank you, I'm dedicated to finish this family, but also I have two
    more concepts I want to play a bit more. I think I'm on my "slab phase" now :)
