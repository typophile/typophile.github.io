  for fi with diacritics.  I was hoping some non-English typophiles would be able
  to help me with the MyFonts posters by providing words/phrases which include these
  ligatures f\xED f\xEE f\xEF f\xEC\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDave\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fi_3925.jpg]"

    mean an f_f_i-dieresis ligature.\r\n\r\nIf your typeface has the usual ligatures:
    f_i, f_l, f_f, f_f_i, f_f_l. Then you add f_i-dieresis etc., how would you handle
    Welsh f_f_i-dieresis, as in coff\xEFau? It would either be \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>f_f

    I think that Dave''s examples are distracting. My Williams Caslon Text uses contextual

  body: "Uh, but wouldn't you have to differ between usage in text and display fonts
    respectively? I'd expect that ligatures (as well as other things) may be allowed
    to be a bit special in a font like <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/82578\">Brag</a>
    that should be used large. Of course in a text font this sort of treatment would
    probably not be very helpful. \r\n(BTW, I mostly agree on the CALT.)"

  body: "Indeed in a display font ligation offers an opportunity to show off; while
    in a text font sobriety can lead to better functionality. For example in Patria
    the \"fl\" ligature has no contact between the letters and the head serif of the
    \"el\" is chopped off (although I slanted the top, for looks); it's not exactly
    pretty, but in text it works better than the dumb traditional ligature.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    impractical anywhere except display.\r\nBut even in the past, designers like Cooper
    (Cooper Black) and Zapf (Palatino) got it right, by designing \"f\"s that didn't
    collide with following ascenders, tittles, and accents.\r\nHowever, if one is
    making an oldstyle undead, it's appropriate to include these archaic devices."
