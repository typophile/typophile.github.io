body: "In the thread http://typophile.com/node/103643, a question was raised that
  can be reformulated as follows: \"how can one build the latin small letter alpha?\",
  which is uni0251 (in the IPA extensions). Even with a serif font, its lower part
  appears to be that of a d and its upper part that of a q. My question here is how
  to do that programmatically.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe intent, in the tread above,
  was to get the corresponding glyph for the Roboto fonts. The question is interesting
  because with Roboto, in all fonts, the d and the q have the same number of truetype
  points, and they are numbered similarly. In order to get the \"latin small letter
  alpha\" in the middle below, I took a d and then moved the points  6, 7 and 8 at
  the coordinates they have in the letter q. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daq-Black3_4307.png]\r\nI
  could in fact do that editing (with a script) the ttx files. I found no way to do
  it (programmatically) with FontForge. I can only get a copy of the contours, the
  modifications are not reflected in the font. I found no way to access those points
  in the font tools. How can you do that (programmatically, I mean) with your professional
  tools (even if it is not really worth the trouble for this particular example).
  Is that easy to do with Glyphs?"

    & f[\"d\"]</pre>\r\n\r\n... but only because RoboFont has implemented the Boolean
    operators (in this case &, \xABand\xBB) for glyph operations. I don\u2019t know
    if other editors have similar options.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glyphmath_4041.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    result would still need some manual cleaning though:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glyphmath-a_3734.png]\r\n\r\nEdit:
    This only seems to work with PS curves, not TT curves."

    contour 0, segment 1, point 2\r\nf[\"a\"][0][1][2].x = f[\"q\"][0][1][2].x\r\nf[\"a\"][0][1][2].y

    in Roboto the q is narrower than the d, so the right side of the new \xABa\xBB

  body: "Jens, I can do the intersection with a native FontForge script (but not with
    an assignment as you did). Here is what I get with the medium weight:\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"/files/lalphamedium_3458.png\">\r\n\r\nThere is too much cleaning to do.\r\n\r\nThe
    Robofab code of your second post is exactly the type of code I had in mind. As
    for the right side, there is no need to change the x coordinate, changing the
    y coordinate fixes the height and then the right side stays vertical.\r\n\r\nIs
    that something that can be programmed as a tool to be used in a GUI environment,
    so that corrections can then be made on the fly?"

  body: "After all, it is unclear I would gain much with Robofab; to create a new
    character, I can do something fairly close to the code above, but I need to use
    the pen to draw (or redraw) the character; here is something that works from the
    Fontforge script menu and creates uni0251 for Roboto.\r\n<PRE>\r\nf=fontforge.activeFont()\r\nld=f[\"d\"].foreground\r\nlq=f[\"q\"].foreground\r\n#
    Contour 0, point 6\r\nld[0][6].x = lq[0][6].x\r\nld[0][6].y = lq[0][6].y\r\n#
    Contour 0, point 7\r\nld[0][7].x = lq[0][7].x\r\nld[0][7].y = lq[0][7].y\r\n#
    Contour 0, point 8\r\nld[0][8].y = lq[0][8].y\r\n# Create the new character\r\nf.createChar(0x0251,\"uni0251\")\r\n#
    Draw the modified layer ld\r\npen=f[\"uni0251\"].glyphPen()\r\nld.draw(pen)\r\npen=None\r\nf[\"uni0251\"].width
    = f[\"d\"].width\r\n</PRE>\r\nSince <code>ld</code> is only a copy, the character
    d is left unchanged.\r\n\r\nAdded: to get the same numbering for the points in
    the resulting glyph, I have to draw contour 1 before contour 0. So it is\r\n<PRE>\r\nld[1].draw(pen);
    \ ld[0].draw(pen)\r\n</PRE>\r\ninstead of <code>ld.draw(pen)</code>. (weird!)\r\n\r\nOf
    course, for the italic, we need to calculate the x coordinate of point 8. To cover
    all cases we thus need to add something like\r\n<PRE>\r\nm=(ld[0][8].x -ld[0][9].x)*1.0/(ld[0][8].y-ld[0][9].y)\r\nld[0][8].x
    =ld[0][9].x + (lq[0][8].y-ld[0][9].y)*m\r\n</PRE>\r\nbefore <code>ld[0][8].y =
    lq[0][8].y</code>. This works fine even for the thin italic where there are four
    points between the top and the bottom of the right part of the d and q.\r\n\r\nHere
    is the picture with d (green) in the background. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/segment-9-10_5148.png]\r\nPoints
    9 and 10 are very close. The value of m above is the slope of the segment 8-9
    when x is seen as a function of y.\r\n\r\nCorrection: there are two other points
    close to 9; there is thus a 9,10,11 cluster and then a 12,13,14 cluster. Hmm,
    no! I looked closer and there is a cluster of four points, 9,10,11,12 and then
    two point 13,14"
