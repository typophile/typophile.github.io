  body: "To me this seems most likely to be hand-drawn. The way the letters are fit
    together, and the way the double-l is drawn makes this unlikely to be a font,
    in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSome of the lettering artists at Letterhead fonts, like
    John Studden, could have done work like this, as I'm sure many other lettering
    artists could have done as well. \r\n\r\nIt's a difficult style to categorize,
    and that makes it even harder to search for. I looked at the Letterhead Fonts,
    Sudtipos and Rob Leuschke's work and found no matches. Maybe someone else has
    some ideas?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
