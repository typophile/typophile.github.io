    like the spare black and white design of the site."

  body: "Silas,\r\n\r\n The site is beautifully exectuded. I love the restrained,
    understated design. The emblem is brilliant. Love the di cut on the card. Is that
    standard biz card dimensions or wider?\r\n\r\nA few notes about the User Experience
    (UX):\r\n\r\n1. Navigation Design: it would be prefereably to, however subtly,
    visually differentiate the navigation label/link (\"portfolio\" etc.) to reflect
    the current location within the IA (info architecture).\r\n\r\n2. The \"email
    away\" link on the about page may confuse users. Most would be expecting a mailto:
    link, rather than a link to the contact section. Either change the wording, or
    make it an actual mailto: link.\r\n\r\n3. Contact form: it's unclear that all
    fields are required. Also it would be smart to use a script to clear the field
    when the user clicks on it, thus saving them the step of having to select the
    text b4 entering their data. For that matter, having the cursor be in the name
    field on page load is also a good idea.\r\n\r\n4. Typo nitpick: do you need the
    colon after section headers (\"About:\")?\r\n\r\nNice work.\r\n\r\n -t"

    The website is nice and clean; I like the whole greyscale idea.\r\n\r\nYou might
    want to add an image or some text to the right-hand column on the Services page.
    \ Maybe a glyph that you're tweaking (with bezier curves and handles)?  In b/w
    of course!"

  body: "Silas, I really like your site.\r\n\r\nYou might want to edit your \"About\"
    text a little. It sounds a bit to informal for my taste. And you have some extra
    words.\r\n\r\nAlso, in your portfolio, it seems that some of the faces are carried
    by T-26? What about a link to the T-26 page for that font, so that visitors can
    go buy the available fonts directly?\r\n\r\n(of course, if your typefaces were
    work for hire, then maybe you wouldn't want to do this, as you wouldn't get anything
    from it)"

  body: "Silas,\r\n\r\nNice work, and some good typefaces in there as well. I like
    the strict design for sure, but I would add some colours here and there, very
    mosdest and discret. Like lines, headlines, titels etc. And of course low key
    flavours like \"earthy\" style. On the type section there ought to be links to
    retailer if sold elsewhere. And I wouldn't mind to see more of each typeface,
    at least upper- and lowercases plus numbers and a few more common signs. Apart
    from this it's a very good start.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n/Stefan H"

  body: "The clean black and white design is striking, and the typefaces strong. I
    think your home screen is visually significantly stronger than the others, because
    of the visual contrast of the two cards. They others are a bit grey and weak compared
    to the dramatic opening screen.  \r\n\r\nAntiphrasis' idea is good for the services
    screen. Also on the portfolio screens, think about balancing the showings vertically,
    so there are blacker weights mixed through the showing. Look at FontBureau's showings
    for examples. You might try adding a single large character on the right also,
    to see if that helps or hurts. \r\n\r\nAlso it would help if you would have navigation
    to page through your portfolio without going back to the home screen. See Jim
    Parkinson's site for an example. Incidentally, both Parkinson's and FontBureau's
    sites are excellent models of well-designed type sites, in my opinion.  "

  body: "Thanks to all for the feedback.  I knew I would get some quality critique
    here.  I must confess, this is a rushed/beta version.  Sorry to heap a half-baked
    site on you all!\r\n\r\nI'm glad everyone appreciates the simplicity.  I strive
    for it.\r\n\r\nNone of my designs are available for retail licensing (yet).  There
    will certainly be links or disclaimers soon.  I'm keeping the Portfolio section
    slim for now... just a taste of my design sensibilities/capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe
    opening image will be randomly selected from snapshots of my fonts in use or my
    custom lettering work (or even doodles).  A bit of entertainment/stickiness value
    not unlike what I have set up on my other site... http://silasdilworth.com\r\n\r\nYes,
    the opening image is of my business card mockup.  Is the D-shaped die-cut overkill?
    \ I haven't printed them yet because I'll be relocating next month.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the navigation oversights and inconsistencies, I'm certainly taking this baby
    back to the drawing board with all that was noted above.  Thanks for the attention
    to these details."

  body: "The site looks really good. Only a couple things, and this is nitpicking:
    1) Your copyright is hard to read (of course, no one's probably reading it anyway).
    2) On your portfolio page, I thought \"Collaborations\" was a font name and I
    tried to click on it. Is there a way to differentiate the \"Originals\" and \"Collaborations\"
    headings from the actual fonts? Maybe a horizontal rule that spans both columns.
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, Trauen looks great. Do you have specimens available?"

    I agree with Stefan though, you should certainly include more glyphs in your samples.
    Stop teasing us and show us your glyphs! :)

    work.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing bugged me. The front page photo (which I know will
    be random in the future). If you're going to show type and the fonts are the focus,
    please make at least the largest type more immediately legible. It really bugged
    me that I couldn't easily read some of the type on the business card(?).\r\n\r\nI
    look forward to more content."
