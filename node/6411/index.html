There&#39;s also a plate of the italic in something Smeijers once published, I think. Then I&#39;m having this vision of all the UC glyphs in the RdR on facing pages, but I can&#39;t remember where I saw that. Sorry. <BR> <BR>Digitizing the RdR would be a great project - it&#39;s shocking that there hasn&#39;t been one yet. You might contact the Imprimerie Nationale of France for leads, and maybe informal &#34;permission&#34; as well. But if they say &#34;no&#34; do it anyway - tell them it belongs to the &#34;patrimoine humaine&#34;, not them.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The RdR committee&#39;s engravings &#40;I mistakenly wrote &#34;drawings&#34; before&#41; were simply too precise. Without a pantograph it would have been impossible to get high fidelity. And then there was the issue of optical scaling you mention: it was something Grandjean implemented of course&#42;, but either the committee didn&#39;t understand its need &#40;only one of its members had any idea of type&#41; or they created the &#34;spirit&#34; and expected Grandjean to &#34;distill&#34; it in the smaller sizes &#40;which is not unreasonable&#41;. The way Grandjean totally dumped the engraved italic however was not a matter of accuracy though, but of taste and practicality. <BR> <BR>&#42; Some people say that -because of the &#34;physicality of scale&#34;- the pre-pantographic designers didn&#39;t really see optical scaling the way we do, they &#34;just did it&#34;, making each size look &#34;correct&#34;. Some however were more sloppy than others - Caslon for example was just wanton in terms of consistency &#40;although the variance in the italic &#34;Q&#34; is genial&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Dan, a question: would you make a literal revival, or a mild adaptation? I think if you want this to be more than of historical interest, if you want people to use it to give their setting the RdR &#34;air&#34; but in a versatile manner, you should take some small-to-medium liberties with it. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, over the weekend I did something I should have done much earlier: check the wonderful Imprimerie Nationale specimen book of 1990, which shows the bulk of their metal collection in great depth and detail. <BR> <BR>First of all, there&#39;s a font called Jaugeon &#40;in 12 sizes from 6 to 20&#41; which is basically a very close rendering of the original engraved plates, done in the beginning of the 20th century. To me it&#39;s very attractive, and actually has a nice dark color. The italic is NOT the one shown in the plates&#42; &#40;it doesn&#39;t have all those serifs&#41;, but it&#39;s much more rigid and regular than Grandjean&#39;s cut. And the italic has some strange features, like a somewhat blackletter-style &#34;k&#34;, and get this, it has those short lefthand spikes on the ascenders on the &#34;h&#34; and &#34;k&#34; as well as the &#34;el&#34;, not that even the &#34;el&#34; needs the spike&#42;&#42; in the italic, since it was there to differentiate the lc roman &#34;el&#34; from the cap roman &#34;I&#34;, but in the italic that problem is gone! Very strange. <BR> <BR>&#42; And I guess this means the RdR had <i>three</i> italics... <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; BTW, I realize now that the claim that Grandjean incorporated the spike of the &#34;el&#34; is bogus, since the source engravings have it. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s the Grandjean font, which was made two centuries earlier, so it seems to be considered the &#34;official&#34; RdR font, but besides being too light I think, it&#39;s not nearly as pure, and some characters &#40;like the &#34;f&#34; and especially &#34;?&#34;&#41; are really malformed. Also, the caps are <i>way</i> too dark, and -as we discussed- the italics are very organic and cursive, really way out of character with the Roman. The Grandjean however was available in much greater a range, with 19 sizes from 7 to 64 &#40;the Jaugeon has no real display cuts&#41; as well as titling initials &#40;16 sizes from 12 to 120&#41;. <BR> <BR>In terms of doing a revival, I guess you might do one of Jaugeon, but you would really need some kind of IN consent there. Or better yet might be doing a revival directly from the plates, including the slanted-roman italics. According to what Patrick has shown me there has been a metal of that in the past, but certainly no digital. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is good info, thank you. I still haven&#39;t gotten my copy of the recent Lyon exhibition catalogue from Vendome, and I&#39;ve just come back from a brief trip to Vienna, so I haven&#39;t had time to scour the libraries in Frankfurt for samples either.&#42; <BR> <BR>A friend of mine who just came over from the States on Sunday did bring me my copy of Friedl&#39;s <i>Typography,</i> and I enjoying perusing those low quality examples. <BR> <BR>My gut feeling is to go for as close of a revival as is possible first. I can always do something more interpretive later. I like the slanted-Roman Italic alot, and will probably work on that first, instead of any other oblique/italic option. It is becoming more common though to design more than one variety of italic for a single Roman... so there will always be room for more. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;This is Germany, so school isn&#39;t going to start up again for another five weeks... everyone helpful in my neck of the woods is still on vacation...</div>

How was the book working for you, and how was your revival going? I noticed that, thus far, some digital revivals of RdR has been on progress, but none has actually been finished.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">But Dan, that seems to be a digitization of a copy of the RdR, "rounder and more dynamic than its original model". Plus where's the italic? Even if it has one, I doubt it's comme il faut.

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe this thread is totally expired, but that book, "Le Romain du Roi – La typographie au service de l'Etat" was published by the Musée de l'Imprimerie in Lyon, France. It may still be available for purchase from them. It's a great book – I have a copy. The book itself has been set in the Romain du Roi – those little spurs on the lower case "l" surprisingly affect the look of the page. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This thread inspired me to search for images of the Romain du Roi design charts on the Web. I could not find a complete set, although there is another drawing of the whole Roman alphabet in squares, but without the construction circles, that is available.

But I came across this sentence, in "A History of the Old English Letter Foundries":

"In recent years a French typographer, M. Motteroz, has attempted to combine the exellences of the Elzevir and modern Roman, with a view to arrive at an ideally legible type."

While the experiment is described as a failure, it is intriguing to me.

... Theodore Low De Vinne reproduced the Motteroz letter in his Plain Printing Types, and I fear I must concur that the result was unattractive in appearance, and thus a failure for the reason cited.</div>
