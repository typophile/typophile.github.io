  used on signage?\r\n\r\nAttached is an image of the look I am going for.\r\nI guess
  from what I have seen a lot of signage has outlines/strokes, drop shadows and Ornate
  Shapes on and around the type. If anyone could also suggest where i could find more
  imagery of fairground typography that would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBarry"
