body: "I would appreciate some advice on proper typesetting for this phrase to be
  used in body text in a real estate brochure.  I have ad copywriters, sales people
  and designers all butting heads on this one.  Thank you.\r\n\r\n<strong>4,000 square
  foot\r\n4,000-square-foot\r\n4,000 square-foot\r\n4,000 sq. ft.\r\n4,000 sq ft</strong>\r\n\r\nIf
  using <strong>sq ft</strong> should it be in small caps?\r\nIs it correct to omit
  the comma and simply use <strong>4000</strong>? "

  body: Chicago Manual of Style (15th edition) says to use "4,000 sq. ft." -- or you
    can use an exponent 2 on the foot, i.e. ft.2 (the 2 would have to be super-scripted).
    U.S.-style numbers use the comma to separate thousands, so "4,000" is appropriate,
    but European-style (except Great Britain) is "4 000" using a half-space instead
    of a comma (the comma is used instead of a decimal point, so "4 000,098" would
    be correct).

  body: 4,000 sq. ft. is OK for four thousand square FEET, but if you're describing
    a home which has 4,000 sq. ft., it should be "4,000-square-foot home," since you
    are using a combination of words, one of which is not an adjective, as an adjective
    (we covered this subject a few weeks ago).

  body: "You could, of course, use the square foot symbol, found at Unicode 23CD,
    if it's included in your font at all.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This is the single straight
    quote mark intersecting a square through the top. It is used more often in signage
    as a space-saving alternative to the abbreviation. It is not often used in running
    text."

  body: "<em>\"I\u2019d say those are all personal preference issues.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    100% the problem. The copy was written as <strong>4,000-square-foot</strong> and
    it sat like a lead weight in every paragraph. I changed it to <strong>4,000 sq
    ft</strong> and it gave the text block an even color ...  but then there were
    arguments against omitting the punctuation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n@ oldnick\r\n\r\nYour
    point makes perfect sense. So, I've decided to typeset based on what it <em>looks
    like</em> in the body text. If it's used as an adjective I'm wrong to set the
    type this way, two hypens are correct?   Can you indicate where I can find that
    previous thread?"
