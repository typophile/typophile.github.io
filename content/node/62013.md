body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nThis is a little monospaced Sans Serif I did. At the moment
  I will just use it for my personal identity to write my letterhead and my bills.
  But when I have some time I will add an italic and a bolder version. What do you
  think of it so far? Hope you like it\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards. Steven"

    K, M. N, V, W and Y should be a tiny bit thinner. Are you going t add weights?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBoris"

  body: "Thank you for your comments so far.\r\n\r\nYes I think I will add a non-monospaced
    version later. And also a bolder version. But unfortunately I don't have much
    time at the moment because I have to do a lot of work for college. I just wanted
    to finish this version for my identity at the moment. \r\n\r\nThanks Boris. I
    will correct the letters as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime you can take
    a look at the picture below. It will give you a better view of the actually sizes
    of the letters and how the look in context...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hilt\xE4p_6270.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers.

  body: "Hi again Steven,\r\n\r\nThe letters in context that you just posted certainly
    look quite elegant. By the way you probably haven't realized that your mono-typeface
    has to a large extent the look and the feel of the Neo-Humanist typefaces which
    are quite hot nowadays. I took a look at your homepage, congratulations for the
    great artwork.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBoris\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Boris :) Glad to hear you like my work.\r\n\r\nI updated my font.
    I think it works better now in text. For testing I set the Kern King by Leslie
    Cabarga. So what do you think? Better?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\n\r\nCheers
    Steven"
