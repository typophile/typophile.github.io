  House]] event @ [[http://www.eamesoffice.com|Eames Office]] in Santa Monica (put
  on by [[http://www.aigalosangeles.org|AIGA/LA]]). \r\n\r\nWhen I saw the poster,
  I thought... House? Eames? At the same time? In my 'hood? IMUSTGO. And so I did.
  And it was so super cool. It's the first event of that sort I'd ever been to, so
  it was all very new to me. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.houseind.com|Andy's]] presentation
  was a bit about the history of House itself and then lots of good stuff on some
  of the collaborations they've done (Benguiat, Shag, Richard Neutra, etc) leading
  up to the beginnings of the collaboration with Eames. \r\n\r\nI got to wander around
  and [[http://flickr.com/photos/dotsara/sets/72157600865103849/|take a slew of pictures]]
  (@ Flickr) (I think my total was around 175...) and meet Andy; as well as Carla
  Hartman (Charles Eames's granddaughter); and also Bonnie & Sarah & Jae of AIGA/LA.
  \r\n\r\nOf course, this was very nearly the first thing I saw when I walked... no
  surprise there. (: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/834101209_f4c4839a32_5212.jpg]"

    that no one from Typophile showed up, and then here you are.\r\n\r\nSo what is
    the upcoming House Industries project? Just the <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/dotsara/834513801/in/set-72157600865103849/\">house</a>?
    (Not that that's anything to scoff at.) Or were there fonts that I'm missing?"
