  body: "Hard to say with so few letters. Some sort of chopped-off serif Didot/Bodoni...
    More details (origin, website, more letters) would be needed to positively identify
    it. Some suggestions in the same vein for the moment: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/chong-modern|Chong
    Modern]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/grenale|Grenale]], <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bodoni+sans|Bodoni
    Sans]]</strong> (the closest so far, possibly matching)\r\n\r\nEDIT: what Kevin
    said + Bodoni Sans"
