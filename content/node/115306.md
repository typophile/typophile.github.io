  body: "For 'REGENSBURG' I found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/woolworth|Woolworth]]
    which looks pretty close. It is said Woolworth is \"A modern sans serif typeface
    inspired by the early work of the Bauer type foundry\". May be that could give
    a good track to find the original name of this font.\r\nI like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/venus|Venus]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/classic-grotesque-pro|Classic Grotesque]].\r\n"

    approach to me, slightly condensed Grotesk with some 'high' counters."
