body: "Hi\r\n\r\nTrying to identify the typeface in this logo. I need to recreate
  it for my client as a vector file. It was probably created late 80's early 90's
  in Australia. The closest I got was Hobo. I have used Indentifont and WhatTheFont
  to no avail.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?"

  body: There was an old film font called Hercules that this matches, but the only
    digital font I found with that name is a completely different design. It's possible
    that there is a digital version of Hercules with a different name.

  body: "I think this was an old Letrasetfont called Herkules, based on an old Art
    Nouveau era typeface called Hercules. I think Dieter Steffmann at typOasis (Designer
    section) has a <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/h/herkules.htm\"
    target=\"new\">digital version</a> of it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    an old Letraset typeface.\r\nOnce again - thanks!\r\nCheers, Kate"
