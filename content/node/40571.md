  light on this logo? It's the old logo of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Ireland.
  My interest is in the lettering. The logo dates back to the start of the 20th century
  so I'm guessing the lettering is almost certainly hand drawn but it must be based
  on something? I'm not an expert in Celtic lettering and could really do with a dig
  out on this one.\r\n\r\nThe printed version on the right features substitute lettering
  for the words in the ring surrounding the cross, using the face used for the rest
  of the magazine cover.\r\nThis is definitely part of a full font. Can anyone help
  identify that?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
