  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone,
I&rsquo;m writing here because I&rsquo;m designing a book, and I need some help to find different typography examples (possibly literature, poems, or other book pages), for the romantic, realist and symbolist period.</p>
<p>Romanticism: I found already some examples, but most of them are set in gothic types, because the books I found which are explicitly romantic are designed in Germany or Switzerland. Robert Bringhurst writes in &ldquo;The elements of typographic style&rdquo; that for example Didot and Walbaum are romantic typefaces, but I can&rsquo;t find any typically romantic literature set in those typefaces.</p>
<p>Realism: Bringhurst also writes that for example Akzidenz Grotesk or Clarendon are realist typefaces, but I can&rsquo;t find any realist literature set in those typefaces.</p>
<p>Symbolism: the only informations I have about symbolist typography is that, as Tschichold writes in &ldquo;Die Neue Typographie&rdquo;, Johannes Itten tryed to create some symbolist typography in the magazine &ldquo;Utopia&rdquo;, published in 1921 in Weimar, I only found [[http://www.vloemans.net/item.php?bookid=4926&amp;c_sourcepage=highlights.php%3Fpg%3D1%23booknr4926|this pages]] ) , but I don&rsquo;t if they are the right ones. And I know that there should be some symbolist typography in the original publication &ldquo;Le Fleuve&rdquo; by Charles Cros (with illustrations by Manet), but I only saw the illustrations without typography.</p>
<p>I hope that there&rsquo;s some one who can help me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is a difficulty with categorization. Someone or a group may put type or other things in groups as a means of discussing their characteristics but this does not mean that they will be used by any number of users in the way described by the original category definer. Works of literature are likewise put in to groups&ndash;sometimes by a school of thought and sometimes by the name of the prevailing period at the time they were published. Publishers have their own way of deciding which typeface to use and it may have nothing to do with the period of the author or the subject matter written about. It is more likely to be part of the working process of the publisher and which types they own and generally use. Perhaps only books that are self-published, where the writer is involved in the whole process, may more care be taken to match a typeface with an author or  text.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Didot and Walbaum don’t get much use outside of display use. In my life I’ve seen two books set in a modern face. Both are contemporary sci-fi. And you can’t find literature in Akzidenz or Clarendon because nobody uses them for books after junior year.</p>
<p>And FYI, Bringhurst’s classification system gets very little use outside of Wikipedia entries, so don’t expect a lot of people to be familiar with the Bringhurst classifications.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank&rsquo;s for your answers. I know that there are a lot of difficults in classification, and also that the evolution of typography wasn&rsquo;t everytime parallel to them of arts (intended as artistic and literature periods). I totally agree with you ChrisL.</p>
<p>Fortunately after days of research I found, as you said, some smaller publication (maybe self-published) which I think correspond better to this classfications, ore have at least different concepts in common with the corresponding art style.</p>
<p>I (now) only need some typography samples which I can interpret as inspired by the concurrent artistic situation. And I found some.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just one thing: it was not uncommon to see book typeset in Didot in France until the 1960s. You can find plenty on ebay. However, the smaller prints were made with specific Didot characters which are easily confused with Egyptians. avec a look at ITC Bodoni 6 and the difference with 12 and 72. ITC Bodoni 6 is fantastic in paperback books! I read a novel typeset with it the other day and it is wonderful.</p>
<p>Check google books: search for Didot tanner.</p>

<p>You would have to go back a few years.
A few months ago I picked up a 1943 copy of Wuthering Heights, set in Bodoni.
Originally, of course, it was set in a Scotch Modern.</p>
<p>These days most people think that oldstyle faces are more appropriate for works of the Romantic era. Go figure.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much figuring to do, Nick. I have the feeling that only a small number of people who design books make any attempt at matching typefaces with the era in which a book was written or with the era under consideration in the text.</p>
<p>The situation is just as ChrisL noted in the last part of his note: publishers or designers they hire have type libraries consisting of fonts they use often, and many rarely venture beyond.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d differ with Chris on the matter of self-published books, though. In that realm there&rsquo;s even less attention made to this sort of matching of type era and text era.</p>
