What politician would worry about how his message is being presented when there are nuts and bolts of policy to attend to? Like painting the logo on their plane &#40;AP: &#34;Turns out the first person to know that John Kerry had decided on John Edward to be his running mate on the Democratic ticket wasn&#39;t even in politics. To guarantee that the name of his vice presidential candidate would be on the side of his campaign plane in time, Kerry first told an employee of the company that would add a decal with Edwards&#39; name.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>Actually I think William is probably right that they don&#39;t want a &#34;designed&#34; look and they like the stolidity of Georgia.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen, I&#39;m well aware that Georgia was designed for the screen. But it&#39;s perfectly alright for text work in print, lacking only kerning, which InD can supply &#34;optically&#34;, for those who care. <BR> <BR>Miller and Fenway would be no good, as I said -- Georgia is a good choice for a campaign, because it is easily available to grassroots workers. <BR> <BR>Being a scotch roman Miller, even if it were available widely, is too &#34;businessy&#34; -- those fancy serifed news faces are Republican, but even something more tabloid would not be as broad-based in its familiarity and appeal as Georgia. Fenway -- no idea what that looks like, who sells it? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not so sure that &#34;display&#34; weights are best for banners. They are often glimpsed from afar, or seen reproduced on TV or web images &#40;as held by a person in the crowd at the top of this thread&#41;, so a strong image is probably better. <BR> <BR>Also, the &#34;logo&#34; will suffer considerable abuse &#40;as on the Kerry website, where the type is horizontally scaled&#41;, so you want a typeface that works in the lowest common denominator, and a web font is a good choice. <BR> <BR>Any alternative &#40;say, with alternate versions of the logo for different media&#41; that required style guide management and logo cops would be unworkable for a political campaign! <BR> <BR>As for the flag, it&#39;s not too bad, and I suspect that &#34;some style&#34; would be too much style for a presidential election campaign. <BR></div>

I have started several discussions regarding this on the official Kerry forum, the latest of which is <a href="http://forum.johnkerry.com/index.php?showtopic=45705">here</a>. <BR> <BR>I have also started <a href="http://zhape.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=21&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">a thread and poll</a> on my own blog. <BR> <BR>I sincerely hope that something can be done about this before the convention. I&#39;ve heard several times over that the reason for the bad design was that the same design was created &#40;and printed&#41; for Edwards, Gephardt AND Vilsack so that no one involved would know who the actual nominee was. I really can&#39;t see how this is an excuse for a design as bad as the current one.</div>
