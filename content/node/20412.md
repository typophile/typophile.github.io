  asking friends, everything. I''m trying to identify and locate the movie that starts
  with a very surreal clay animated title sequence, with little clay balls, blocks
  and trees all marching or rolling or erupting into letters to form the names of
  the actors. Each name is a different sort of re-formation, from cylinders unrolling
  to show the letters, to craters in the ground erupting with letters, to waves of
  clay washing up and turning into letters. I seem to recall it''s from the ''60''s,
  and it might be an Annette Funicello movie for all I know. I probably can''t remember
  the movie because the titles are the best thing about it. It is a comedy, I''m sure.
  Does anyone remember that sequence, and know which movie it is? '

    probably had a hand in my obsession with letters.\r\n\r\nI had some plaster letters
    just like these when I was about six years old:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/53893098/in/set-1168574/\r\n\r\nMy
    dad salvaged some panels that were used at trade shows by the company he worked
    for. They were covered with letters like these in two sizes, around two inches
    tall, painted forest green. He pried them off and gave them to me. I used to spend
    hours playing with them. I'm sure they were a subconscious influence on <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/refrigerator.html\">this</a>.
    I wonder whatever became of them.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for going OT...)"
