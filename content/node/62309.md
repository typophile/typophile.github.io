    it?\r\n\r\nYou can always take any font, duplicate it, shift the top copy up and
    to the left, then add a white outer stroke to it to replicate this effect.\r\n\r\n

  body: I don't particularly like what happens with the lines on the 'G' and the 'O'
    and was just wondering if anyone knew of any alternatives that existed. Thanks
    for your suggesting though Lex.
