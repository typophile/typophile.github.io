  far, so good. I hoped if I closed my eyes and turned up the volume on my discman
  that this whole technology thing might go away. Or at least give me time to catch
  up. Denial can be a comfortable place, for awhile.\r\n\r\nBut I'm thrilled to have
  discovered Typophile (thank you, Dave Cowan). I just started teaching a class on
  Typography at the Art Institute in Seattle, so I'm looking forward to sharing what
  I know and learning more along the way. Any current or previous typography teachers
  with bang up lesson plans and/or exercises, please feel free to share.\r\n\r\nAs
  a side note, to anyone who has never taught before -- it's hard. Really hard. We
  should all send our teachers thank you notes. I realize it gets easier as you go,
  but it takes a real gift to share excitement and useful information about a given
  subject, without leaving your audience in a hazy cloud of confusion. Add this to
  the fact that technology is constantly changing, so a good instructor must also
  struggle to remain up-to-date and relevant. My hat's off to those truly wonderful
  teachers out there."
