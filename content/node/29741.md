  body: "Kristian, \r\n\r\nactually, I recommend including both slanted and upright
    punctuation in an italic font (the upright being stylistic set 1, for example).
    Depending on the context and the language you're setting, people may want to set
    punctuation italic or upright. In some countries the typographic practice is that
    if you insert an italic quotation into parantheses in a upright text, the parantheses
    will be upright. However, if you use the upright parantheses from the upright
    font, you'll end up with spacing problems that need to be corrected manually.
    Therefore, it would be quite useful to have the upright fonts in the italic font,
    of course properly spaced to go well with the italic letters. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "I think it depends on the face.\r\nIt is certainly more appropriate to have
    slanted marks in a sans serif, especially when the italic is very much a slanted
    version of the roman.\r\nIn serifed faces where the italic serifs are prominent,
    some upright marks such as the parentheses, look much better straight than slanted.
    The reason is that the serifs \"fill out the square\". See below.\r\nRather than
    accept the editor's view, via Chicago or whatever authority, this is more a decision
    for the typographer.\r\nIn italics, the degree of slant varies within most faces.
    The round letters in Helvetica, for instance, have less slant than the straight
    ones. And in many old style italics, some of the punctuation has very little slant
    at all. See the Caslon commas:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slantmarks_4742.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, \r\n\r\nthe some problematic issues about Minion Pro that come to my
    head are: \r\n\r\nMinion Pro problematic issue 1: The mess regarding superscript
    and subscript glyphs. \r\n\r\nI've discussed my position at large at http://typophile.com/node/16879
    , and my remarks still stand. The set of superscript and subscript glyphs really
    needs to be as complete as possible, or none at all. I'd even go as far as to
    say that the entire character set could be replicated in sups and subs/sinf. I
    mean, why not :) \r\n\r\nIf you design your typeface with optical sizes, then
    you're a winner. Because essentially, all you need to do is to pick the right
    optical size for each of your basic optical sizes, and reduce the size down by
    a percentage. For example for your 10 pt font, you could use a 5 pt master, and
    for your 36 pt font you need to use a 18 pt master. (In reality, you'd use different
    factors, like 55%-60%).\r\n\r\nBefore doing the procedure described below, make
    sure that your glyphset is reasonably sorted in your font and that your metrics
    and kerning for all the glyphs that you want to provide in the half-sized sets
    are already designed and kerned. \r\n\r\nIf you design using an optical size MM
    axis, you can generate the \"half-sized\" masters as instances. Then, in Tools
    / Action / Contour / Scale, you choose a 53% horizontal scale and a 50% vertical
    scale, or something like that. Your kerning, metrics and hinting will be scaled
    as well. This is your master for the half-sized glyphs. \r\n\r\nYou may now remove
    some glyphs that you don't think need to be included in the half-sized way. However,
    I don't think there's something wrong with just including all your glyphs rather
    than just a-z and 0-9. Well, you probably want to remove \".notdef\" and space\"
    there. \r\n\r\nSwitch to the Index mode of your Font Window. Now open the classes
    panel in the half-sized font and drag the entire character set onto a new class
    which you should call \"_subs1\". You should use \"_\" because you may also use
    this class definition as a kerning class. Pick one key glyph in this class, e.g.
    \"n\". \r\n\r\nCopy-and-paste this class definition into your target font Classes
    panel. This will be the class that represents all the glyphs that will be replaced
    in the sups, subs, sinf and ordn features. \r\n\r\nYou will need to create four
    sets of them: sitting on a baseline, below the baseline, touching the caps height
    line or being slightly below it, and above the caps height line. What you have
    now is the first set. (Alternatively, you may want to only include three sets:
    below the baseline, touching the caps height and above the caps height). \r\n\r\nYou
    save this font, then you run a simple Python macro: \r\n\r\nfor g in fl.font.glyphs:
    g.name = g.name + \".subs\"\r\nfl.UpdateFont(-1)\r\n\r\nAfter that, choose Glyph
    / Glyph Names / Generate Unicode. This gives you a set of glyphs which you will
    include in your font for the \"subs\" feature. \r\n\r\nGo to your main font, choose
    Tools / Merge Fonts and add the half-sized glyphs to your font. You go back to
    your half-sized font, revert the changes (so the suffixes are gone) and you append
    a new set of suffixes using the little Python macro, this time \".sinf\". You
    move your glyphs below the baseline (using Action / Contour / Shift) and repeat
    the merging into your base font. Then, you revert your half-sized font again,
    append the \".ordn\" suffix and move your glyphs to touch or be slightly below
    the caps height, and you repeat the procedure. Finally, you use the \".sups\"
    suffix and move the glyphs to be above the caps height. \r\n\r\nNow you have four
    sets of \"half-sized\" glyphs at different positions. For each of the sets that
    you have added, select all the glyphs and drag-and-drop them onto new classes,
    named: _subs2, _sinf2, _ordn2 and _sups2. You should use an \"_\" at the beginnig
    because you will also use these classes in class kerning. Pick one glyph such
    as \"n\" from each class (i.e. n.subs, n.sinf, n.ordn and n.sups) as key glyph
    and set the kerning scope for these classes to both L and R. \r\n\r\nThen, the
    only thing you need to do is to add the OT Layout code: \r\n\r\nfeature subs {
    sub @_subs1 by @_subs2; } subs; \r\nfeature sinf { sub @_subs1 by @_sinf2; } sinf;
    \r\nfeature ordn { sub @_subs1 by @_ordn2; } ordn; \r\nfeature sups { sub @_subs1
    by @_sups2; } sups; \r\n\r\nFinally, you need to add some positive kerning values
    for the classes you created against some problematic glyphs, e.g. parantheses,
    lowercase f etc. In fact, you will already do a lot of damage prevention if you
    simply add positive kerning for all the pairs in the string:\r\n\r\n/n/n.subs/n/n.sinf/n/n.ordn/n/n.sups/n\r\n\r\nThis
    will result in positive kerning between all the classes that you created. I think
    it's quite safe to assume that some extra letterspacing will always be useful
    whenever the font switches to any of the half-sized letters. Of course, the positive
    kerns between /n/n.sinf/n/n.sups/n may be larger than between /n/n.subs/n/n.ordn/n
    because the half-sized glyphs that hang below the baseline or above the caps height
    have more potential to clash with the full-sized glyphs. You may want to do some
    extra kerning for glyphs like parantheses, f or Q. \r\n\r\nMinion Pro problematic
    issue 2: The absence of upright punctuation in italics. \r\n\r\nThis is especially
    problematic for parantheses, brackets and quotation marks. In some typographic
    practices, the rule is that you you have some upright text and then there are
    quotation marks, parantheses or brackets, and the text inside these is italic,
    you set the punctuation upright rather than italic. The rationale of it is that
    the quotation marks, parantheses or brackets do not \"belong\" to the italicized
    quotation but to the surrounding upright text. This typographic practice poses
    problems especially when there are italicized letters such as \"f\" immediately
    followed by upright quotation marks or closing parantheses. Since there is a font
    change, there is no possibility for automatic kerning. If the font vendor provided
    upright punctuation in the italic cuts, and it were properly kerned against the
    italic letters (or simply the left sidebearing of the closing brackets, parantheses
    or quotation marks in those upright sets were enlarged), all the nasty typesetting
    problems would go away -- of course provided that the typesetter knew about that
    particular feature. The upright variants should be placed in one of the \"ssXX\"
    features and in the \"salt\" feature. \r\n\r\nMinion Pro problematic issue 3:
    The absence of combining (non-spacing) diacritical marks from the U+03xx section.
    \r\n\r\nIf included, users could build some special accented characters more easily.
    Of course ideally, a \"mark\" positioning feature could be defined in VOLT so
    that combining marks that follow letters would automatically snap into the right
    positions when typeset, but this requires using VOLT and is not currently supported
    by InDesign. However, even the mere presence of the combining diacritics would
    already be helpful. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
