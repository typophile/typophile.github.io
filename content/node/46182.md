    is a sans-serif signage typeface. [[Frutiger]] is kind of the precursor of this
    genre. [[Myriad]], also in this tradition, has the rounded tittles on i & j, like
    Markeur. However, Markeur has been designed for a very special purpose. You can
    read about it <a href=\"http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns02.html\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nF"

    thoughts and the links. The softness of Markeur's corners is what really struck
    me and had hoped that a workable option had been created or at the least an option
    that used Markeur as its inspiration.\r\nFrutiger and Myriad are good options.
    Any other recommendations?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/markeur1_5969.jpg]\r\n-\r\nstudio5in1.com\r\n11211\r\n"
