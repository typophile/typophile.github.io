body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs things are really slowing down with my freelance work, I
  am pondering on offering portfolio photography services as a side gig. My question
  to you is what would you expect the service to cost? I am thinking a flat fee for
  photography, clean-up, and resizing 12 pieces with color correction and isolation
  as extras. What do you think? \r\n\r\nBelow are some samples that I shot for my
  own portfolio. \r\n\r\nAny input is much appreciated, thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nAce"
