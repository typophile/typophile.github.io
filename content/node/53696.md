body: "Hey guys, long time reader, first post! We are working on a logo for a non-profit
  organization called Healing Icons. I guess I am just wondering what you guys think
  about concept so far, I know the execution is not there yet..these are just some
  rough sketches.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HISketch_6358.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/HISketch2_5360.png]\r\n\r\nWe
  wanted to do something simple and play off of the letters. We were kind of leaning
  towards exploring the last sketch...the letter being an H and an I depending on
  which way you look at it. Just wanted some outside opinions before we continued!\r\n\r\nMy
  main concern is it might be a little to sterile for what the organization is doing...maybe
  not enough energy.  It is basically an art support program for patients with cancer
  in which they make art that reflects their own struggle with being diagnosed, etc."

  body: Sorry if that was a little unclear.  The organization is an art support program
    for patients with cancer.  It's six sessions, and during the sessions the patients
    create artwork based on their experience with the disease.  The whole thing is
    really about the idea of a community of people bonding over shared experiences.

  body: I think that last one has quite a lot of playful energy. Have you tried putting
    a small i dot to the right of it?

  body: Hmmm, the last one meaning the one on the graph paper or the letter by itself?
    I should have numbered these before I put them up!

  body: I meant the diagonal H/I as the last one. The dot would be just to the right
    in line with the bar of the H.

  body: I spontaneously read the last one as 3-dimensional, which makes it a ladder
    with only one step (I do find that interesting imagery). It's tipping over, though.

  body: My thoughts are none of your sketches seem to fit the organization they're
    supposed to be representing. Like you said, they seem a little sterile for what
    the org does. That said, I like the potential of the one on the far right. I could
    see it being used in some other industry or field, just not this particular project.

  body: "The last one with rotated H may be the best one. If you imagine a dot to
    the right of it, making a \"i\" of the cross bar of the H. SO it combines H and
    i. And having both somehow falling maybe does show cancer patients. Their life
    falls apart. They have to rethink their life etc. So. Rotated H with i as cross
    bar looks the strongest to my eyes.\r\n\r\nBut I'd get rid of those rounded endings.
    And in the colour version you could make a better distinction of the i in the
    H.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: the last one instantly reminded me of a hospital helicopter landing pad, which
    probably isn't the greatest thing to be reminded of when dealing with a logo that
    heavily involves cancer patients
