  unicode character?\r\nFor instance I would like to know, why \u0243 (<a href=\"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0243/index.htm\">U+0243</a>)
  exists, when it was created...\r\nThank you for your help."

    character, I hope they would post it on [[http://www.decodeunicode.org/en/u+0243]]

    Code Charts]]. Enter U+0243 and then click \"go\". You get that U+0243 is the
    upper case of U+0180 for which one reads:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u0180_4887.jpg]"

    info on the relevance of a character. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf\">this
    page</a> with some cross-referencing tells us \u0243 is a capitalized alternate
    symbol for the voiced bilabial fricative in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanist_phonetic_notation\">Americanist
    phonetic notation</a>."

  body: The text file [[http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt]] is also
    very handy. With simple searches, you often get there all the information you
    need.
