    that he was so excitable.

  body: 'Speaking of Gill and Morrison, there''s a treasury of typographical history
    in ''A Poet in Walton Street'' by Simon Nowell-Smith, and the collection of which
    it forms a part, "Essays Mainly on the 19th Century Presented to Sir Humphrey
    Ward", 1948, Oxford U Press. The article by Nowell-Smith primarily treats the
    printing history of Robert Bridges, poet laureate of England at the time. The
    poet and his wife superintended, exactingly, the typography of his books and Mrs.
    Bridges worked on a phonetic alphabet based on a half-uncial drawn in the 18th
    century. (She was also the author of "New Handwriting for Teachers".) Everybody
    who was anybody in the typographical scene of the early 20th century, including
    Edward Johnson, Logan Pearsall Smith, Bruce Rogers and D. W. Updike, has a walk-on
    in this relation, and the marquee fonts are there, too: the Fell types, Baskerville,
    Fournier, Centaur and Arrighi, Bembo and Blado. '

    his charm, his crankiness and his weirdness all come through.\r\n\r\nBeatrice
    Warde talks about how she posed nude as a young woman for Gill. She modestly refers
    to her legs as interesting to Gill, but there is a provocative woodblock of her
    as a nude that shows his interest was more --er-- wide ranging. Gill wrote of
    her \"fine American carcass\" and she uses the same language jocularly without
    offense, though it sounds pretty dreadful. "

  body: "Detouring (I was going to say, 'deviating') from the topic of Gill, it's
    also noted in the Nowell-Smith article that Arrighi, which had lately been recut
    by Frederick Warde, was given a first trial in a collection of Bridges' poems,
    'The Tapestry'. An edition of 150 copies was privately published in November,
    1925, by Warde and Stanley Morrison. For this book the poet 'had prevailed upon
    Mr. Morrison to design an additional character in order to distinguish hard from
    soft 'g'.' This was a small instance of Bridges' use of special characters, a
    case of the poet's desire to bend the alphabet into serving his vocal intent.\r\n\r\nIf
    there isn't already a book on poets' experiments with phonetics, there ought to
    be one written.\r\n\r\nEric Gill designed and cut the dedication, \"To the King',
    for a deluxe limited edition of Bridges' 'The Testament of Beauty'. It was printed
    in red ink. (It's seems minor irony [in view of Gill's politics] that Perpetua
    Italic seems to have become the go-to typeface for royal wedding invitations.
    It was used not only for the recent nuptials of Prince William, but also for Chas
    & Di.)\r\n\r\n "
