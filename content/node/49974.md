  book celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. I'm not sure if it has always been
  set in this typeface.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TigerID_4835.jpg]\r\n\r\nwhatthefont
  seems to ignore the lower case g and a, and says it is Garamond Light. Indentifont
  says [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/plantin_schoolbook/|Plantin
  Schoolbook]] or Plantin Infant, but that is ignoring the serifs on the T and W."

  body: Thanks. That is close too. I've got 24 hours to find the actual one and if
    not I'll go for either the Bembo or Plantin.

  body: "Everything except the 'a' and 'g' is definitely ITC Garamond, so I'm guessing
    this is either a custom schoolbook version of ITC Garamond, or perhaps as Marc
    suggested there may have been an ITC Garamond Schoolbook out there at some point.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I know this was way back but did you reslove this? Did you find the font?
    I have very similar one used in Elmer picture books as well and I also need to
    find out what it is really called. The file we used is called Garom 3Inf but I
    don't think such a font really exisits. \r\nThe closest I have are Plantin Edu
    (sometimes called SchoolBook) and Bembo Schoolbook (sometimes called Infant) I'd
    be very interested to know if you used something better / closer to this one in
    Tiger Who Came to Tea.\r\nthanks\r\nBeccy "
