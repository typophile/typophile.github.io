body: Correct me if I am wrong but I believe the little hooks in the top left on lowercase
  letters like 'p',  'r', 'm', and 'n' are called terminals? What kind of fonts don't
  have terminals or whatever the hooks are called?

    has angled terminals.

  body: "\"It was my understanding that the end of any stroke was technically a terminal.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is true. But I believe the little hardly-ever hooks(?) on the top left of lowercase
    letters like 'p', 'r', 'm', and 'n' are terminals, of the serif subclass, within
    the horizontal serif under subclass, nested in the left-sided horizontal serif
    super-under subclass, tucked firmly into the x-height left-sided horizontal serif
    micro-class, though others may have names with more precision. \r\n\r\n"
