  system and I was thinking of staring my presentation with a famous quote or some
  words of wisdom by a designer, typographer, etc. regarding designing a an identity
  system or even design discipline in general. Something to warm up a crowd and connect
  with the audience. Does anyone know some quotes that could work in my case or could
  point me somewhere I could find something. All help would be greatly appreciated
  ! Thanks very much,\r\n\r\n\r\nJen\r\n"

    subject just earlier this evening. I hope he won't mind my sharing them here.\r\n\r\n'You
    cannot not communicate' - Paul Watzlawik\r\n\r\n'You are what you are seen to
    be' - Erik Spiekermann\r\n\r\n'Appearances are not false' (Nur der Schein tr\xFCgt
    nicht) - Paul Klee\r\n\r\n'Form is the outside of content, and content is the
    inside of form' - Jean-Luc Godard\r\n\r\nOf course, one implication of all these
    quotes is that identity design won't do anything for you if you suck."

  body: "Bruce Chizen, CEO, Adobe:\r\n\r\n\"One of my biggest challenges in taking
    over from two great founders has been trying to figure out how to change the company
    without destroying the culture that John and Chuck built. It's tough -- because
    the company needs to mature, needs to be much more business focused. Yet, at the
    end of the day, innovation is about the employees. We're an I.P. [intellectual
    property] company -- it's what's in people's heads that makes a difference. And
    the fact that we keep making the Fortune \"Best Places to Work\" list is refreshing.
    The fact that we improve on the list is even more refreshing, despite the company
    having become much more performance oriented.\""
