body: This is a very interesting font I came across and I have been struggling for
  hours now to find out what it is. Its part of the logo for the BCN pels Drets human,
  the Barcelona human rights council, a government organization. Does anyone know
  who designed this font or identity? It reminds me of Klavika, but of course it is
  not. Thanks very much.
