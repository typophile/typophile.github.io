  vertex on the 'M' that only drops to the x-height.  This font appears to be the
  similar to the font on many other public buildings--schools, post offices, etc--built
  in the 1950s and 1960s around the Twin Cities.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fire7_3840.jpg]\r\n\r\nFWIW,
  this is the Minneapolis Fire Station #7 on E Franklin at Cedar.\r\n\r\nI love the
  curved stroke on the '7'."

  body: "That curved 7 is pretty hard to get in a Geometric Sans, though, although
    yes, Kabel or Erbar would be pretty close.\r\n\r\nJust for curiosity's sake, I
    spent the last hour-and-a half looking for fonts with the keyword \"Geometric\"
    on Linotype and found no match to this one. Stephen, you might be correct with
    the flipped W if my eyes haven't failed me :)"

    Neutraface is based on. Kabel will get you close.\"\r\n\r\nNeutraface, Gotham,
    Proxima Nova... they're all based on mid-century American lettering. And you're
    right--Kabel is very similar. I'd even bet that a lot of the architectural lettering
    is even inspired by Kabel.\r\n\r\nI wonder why there are so many variations on
    this idea, though? And how could it be reinterpreted or improved upon?"

  body: "Err, because -- if we took the pessimist look on things -- back in the day
    when Futura was so popular, everybody made a copy of their own interpretation
    -- all supposedly look very close to the original -- and ran away with it. Spartan
    and Geometric 231 are good examples (no offense to anybody).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion,
    there is two branches of mid-century architectural face. One is more geometric
    (Futura, Kabel, etc.) and one more along the lines of grotesk (Neutraface, Proxima
    Nova and what have you)."

  body: H&FJ's new Verlag would be a recent interpretation of that. As Avenir was
    to Futura, Verlag was to Kabel and Neutraface (considering the x-height, ascender
    and descender, length-wise, and ignoring the fact that I classified both fonts
    into different sub-genres.)
