  body: I would say that it was &#39;inspired&#39; by a number of Blackletter alphabets
    that were then flamboyantly exaggerated to give it a more dramatic look. The letters
    are a mix of Fraktur and Old English features, but altered for stylistic purposes
    &#40;and legibility&#41;. For example the &#39;a&#39; is more like the English
    Blacketter styles, but the &#39;h&#39; is more like many Fraktur styles, except
    for the spur on the left side of the stem, which I think is another stylistic
    choice not based on a typeface. The &#39;m&#39; is made to mimic the &#39;h&#39;,
    but is not like an &#39;m&#39; in either Blackletter form. The &#39;C&#39; is
    more like an enlarged lower case letter than any Blackletter upper case C.  <BR>
    <BR>I say it&#39;s a made-for-TV mutation, with little typographic basis.

  body: I&#39;m almost positive that Margo Chase did the logo, so my guess is that
    the font is a knockoff of the logo, not the other way around. Regardless, it&#39;s
    probably at least a serviceable starting point.
