  80 page presentations for me...I've got the cover, and the backer, and the guts...and
  I reeeeeallly don't want to bring this to kinkos and have them do a bad spiral binding
  job on it. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has a recommendation in the NYC area, leave a comment.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance!!\r\n\r\nSusy"
