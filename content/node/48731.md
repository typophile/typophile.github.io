  body: I hope to pick up my visa on Tuesday. In any event, I've booked everything
    else. I'll be there from the 18th to the 21st, staying in the Hotel Moscow, or
    Moskva, depending on which spelling of theirs or which website you prefer ;-)

  body: "As my esteemed colleague G\xF6ran already has told you I will be there as
    well. Thanks to sauna pictures from their relaxation area of unearthly tackiness
    we chose the <em>Hotel Moscow</em>. These are now unfortunately removed.\r\n\r\nMy
    plan is to cover some impressions of the conference on my blog [[http://typografism.se/|Typografism]].
    It's usually in Swedish and deals with the kind of stuff that other, <em>better</em>,
    bloggers, like James Mosley misses out on. For instance the fact that Simon de
    Colines during a period included [[http://typografism.se/?p=176|killer rabbits]]
    on his book covers. Also featured are rebuses of Swedish type designers (I'm particularly
    happy with [[http://typografism.se/wp-content/uploads/rebus1.gif|this one]], even
    if it's in Swedish you can figure it out) and reflections on ornament, Ben Shahn
    and my brief adventures as a Commodore 64 type-designer.\r\n\r\nA brief summary
    in English could of course be added to the St Petersburg blogposts as an attempt
    to establish myself as an important type blog authority of international reputation.
    \r\n\r\nI expect some assistance from G\xF6ran (<em>this will be first time he
    hears of it, btw</em>) in covering the Typetech part. \r\n\r\nSee You there!\r\n\r\n\u0192"

    to the left as you exit the terminal. SPb Pulkovo 2 is quite small terminal, no
    chance to get lost there.\r\n\r\nBus will stop at \"Moskovskaya\" metro station
    which is on the \"blue\" line. If you just go on to the north and exit on \"Nevsky
    Prospect\" - that will be as close to the \"center\" as it can be. Or you can
    change to the red line on \"Tekhnologichesky Institute\" (just walk on the opposite
    side of the station, no need to use stairways or elevators) and exit on \"Ploschad
    Vosstania\". If you want to go to Hotel Moscow, you need to change at \"Nevsky
    Prospect\" to \"Gostinyi Dvor\" and take another 2 stops to \"Ploschad Alexandra
    Nevskogo\". Which is located *in* the hotel.\r\n\r\nThis is the map (in Russian,
    but you have to learn a bit of it anyway :-):\r\nhttp://maps.yandex.ru/metro.xml?mapID=500\r\n\r\nMore

    will take 15-20 minutes from the airport to the metro station, Pulkovo is quite
