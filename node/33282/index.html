Rocking their 1971 logo, the Canucks knocked out the Dallas Stars in game 7, first round of the NHL playoffs.
Reviving the awesome original logo must have had something to do with it, as the Stars' is somewhat cheesy. Star = A, get it? And Helveticaaaa&hellip; Always tough adapting second-hand goods (it made more sense when they were the Minnesota North Stars). I guess the name Oilers was already taken. However, the total-jersey interpretation is quite cool.

Ah, to see Ceasar Maniago take one on the forehead for a 10-56 team, while being outshot 430-12 by the MapleLeafs, (the MAPLE LEAFS!) those were the days? Not! but well worth the 10 bucks, was it? Gump Worseley, &ldquo;Elbows&rdquo; Erik Nestorenko, Wayne Maki, Pie Mackenzie, Guy Lapointe, Yvan Cournoyer, Roger Crozier, these were players who left splinters after just being talked about.</p>
<p>Now, even Americans tink de can play eh?. ;) Anyway, happy 30th (the Hanson bros. screen de butte).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It was in 1992/93 when the DEG from Dusseldorf, Germany&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Paris&rdquo; became Champion in hockey.
5 matches in the play offs agaist Cologne.
Cologne and Dusseldorf are like dogs and cats - but only approx. 40 miles from each other.
The 4th match was in Cologne, but 6,000 fans stood <em>in front of</em> the Dusseldorf stadium. There was nothing - no big video screen, nothing. The stadium was closed. But the police insisted to open it because the people were standing aroung on the streets in the traffic.
A stadium speaker told us details from the match. And they played the german hockey songs we all singing together. - We lost.</p>
<p>The fifth and last match was in Dusseldorf.
John Peter Lee, Chris Valentine, Benoit Doucet.
They did it.
When Ben Doucet shot the 5:4 - he was close to God - we all were.
Champion. In my hometown. Against Cologne. This was magic, men&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>ok. Good old retro 70s Canucks logo, I had table hockey players with Canuck shirts like that, my original 2 teams where Montreal vs Toronto and they were metal but they started making flat plastic ones as well with stick on uni&rsquo;s. I later bought a game with 3D players and painted them Boston Bruins vs Chicago Blackhawks. I still have that.</p>
<p>Dallas has had professional ice hockey teams since at least 1945 and there is a well known rink in a mall in Dallas. Jim Gallagher when he was at Macromedia (Fontographer) use to play ice hockey in a Dallas men&rsquo;s league.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/smith_4346.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I grew up playing ice hockey on ponds, rivers, flooded backyards and fields but when we got older and more competitive you had to play only indoors on rinks and never use your good skates on ponds since they aren&rsquo;t smooth and have lots of twigs and sand in the ice. You can play the game anywhere there is refrigeration and aircon. I use to play at the old Sky Rink in Manhattan which was on something like the 17th floor, 33 between 10th and 11th.</p>
<p>Go Canucks!</p>
<p>p.s. As the story goes Bobby Hull invented the curved ice hockey stick when one day after practice he put his wet stick against a heater and it caused the blade to curve. I use to try to curve my own stick by soaking it then wrapping it with tin foil and putting it in the oven. This unfortunately makes the fibreglass tape on the blade come loose.</p>

<p>say&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>As legend has it, one day at practice Mikita accidentally split the flat, straight blade of his hockey stick into a V-shape. Without pausing to change sticks, Mikita continued playing in the scrimmage. To his surprise, he found that he could rip off faster and harder shots with the crooked cudgel. Soon, he and Hull began using severely curved blades in games. Hull played with up to a one-and-a-half inch curve on his stick.</p>
<p>p.s. I was looking through stuff and saw I had almost only the 6 NHL shirts&hellip;  (no toronto had one as a kid though)</p>
<p>Boston (Black), Montreal (Red) , Chicago (Red), NY Rangers (White), Detroit (White no logo), also&hellip; Team Canada (white), Team Finland (Blue), Microsoft Windows 2000 Ronald McDonald Challenge (teal).</p>

&quot; Without pausing to change sticks&hellip;&quot; normally a 2 minute penalty,,,Wayne&rsquo;s World did a lot for his career though.</p>
<p>I had all six teams in all metal for my table hockey and I had all the cards of all the players. But I was to be damned if I was gonna go out and get more just to be complete to the last of Charlie Finley&rsquo;s California &ldquo;Golden Seals&rdquo; or the dreadfully small but slow Penguins.</p>
<p>Unless you consider the hammer throw as tossing an on-curve and off-curve point as far as you can, I think hockey is about as close to type design as you can get. Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
