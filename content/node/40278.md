body: Hi...I'm wondering if anyone knows of any fonts that have a dropshadow built
  in as part of the font. The company I work for is going to automate their price
  tagging and the computer programmers tell me that I can't add a drop shadow to the
  current piece of cra]p font..or any font for that matter. My boss is insane about
  having a drop shadow on his price tags. HELP!!!!Please!!!!

  body: Hopefully you will be able to live with something from Aluminum's list, because
    I don't know of any font with a shadow built in like russel shows. (I am assuming
    that was a gif with the shadow added later.)

  body: "Presumably it would be possible to have a font with a half tone drop shadow
    on each glyph, but the DPI would be relative to font size, and probably by necessity
    rather course. \r\n\r\nMaybe if the price tags are printed in two colours (and
    the second one happens to be grey :o) you could off-set the grey, and get your
    drop shade that way.\r\n\r\nDon, that's a jpg of text with the shade added. Most
    design aps should be able to handle editable text with drop shade effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    like it is custom built and the programmers are too lazy (or weren't given the
    resources) to program drop shadows in."

  body: "They said you can't add a drop shadow to a /font/.  I don't really say where
    it was said the program could not be made to dropshadow the price when printed,
    leaving the font itself alone, although that may have been what they meant, but
    teh fact that you can't really have a nice gradient shadow inside any font system
    I know of does make the answer a bit ambiguous.\r\n"

  body: As you saw on the myfonts link above, drop shadows embedded in fonts are all
    solid, not halftone and certainly not fuzzy. But you can create these effects
    per text box in Creative Suite programs and Quark 7. I doubt it will ever be possible
    to put halftone or fuzzy drop shadows into a font--they have their hands full
    just extending the glyph coverage! You can create shadowed reusable type buttons
    and motifs for a web design, though.

  body: Thanks! Yeah the program is a bit of a pain in the butt! It's called E-pass.
    Which essentially is what the company uses to do everything from database to customer
    invoices to...EVERYTHING. So it is very limited. No creative flair at all. There
    was a couple in there that might be of use. Thanks for your input!
