body: Hello everybody, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve just bought a Palm and I&#39;ve been <BR>wondering
  if anybody here have ever  <BR>designed a font for the Palm OS. <BR> <BR>How&#39;s
  this stuff going? Any good font <BR>design software and font sellers? <BR> <BR>Cheers,
  <BR>hC

  body: Yes, there is, and yes, I have designed several fonts for Palm OS. In my opinion,
    it&#39;s an ideal place to design bitmap fonts. <BR> <BR>The leading package is
    probably Font Editor 1.9 by Symbioforge, which hasn&#39;t been updated in a while.
    It&#39;s at <a href="http://www.symbioforge.com/products.html" target="_blank">http://www.symbioforge.com/products.html</a>.
    You&#39;ll need a &#34;Hack&#34; program to implement the fonts, however- Look
    for &#34;<a href="http://www.sergem.net/fonthack123/">FontHack123</a>&#34; which
    plugs into Xmaster or Hackmaster for that. <BR> <BR>I recently contacted the developer
    of FE who assures me that a Palm OS 5 version is coming in the next few months.
    I&#39;m trying to see if we can Beta it here for him at Typophile. <BR> <BR>From
    my testing, FontHack123 won&#39;t currently work with OS 5 series Palm devices-
    Clearly these guys need to catch up. With the new high-res screens, I&#39;m really
    wanting to design and implement some tighter bitmaps, which is not possible now.

    palm bitmap fonts colection done on FE previously. Grrr. I can&#39;t wait more.
    Its sad. The FontHack 123 guy stop to answer to emails and seems to stop to be
    interested i think? Already no support for Cli

  body: 'Jared: <BR>Nice! Thanks for the FE tip. I&#39;m taking  <BR>a look on it
    right now... Do you have any <BR>specimen of your palm bitmap fonts?  <BR> <BR>Hrant:
    <BR>Do you know if is there a Palm technology  <BR>similar to Cleartype? Coudn&#39;t
    find anything <BR>on Palm&#39;s website &#40;maybe it&#39;s time to join <BR>their
    developers community ;&#41; <BR> <BR>hC'

  body: You don&#39;t really need any &#34;technology&#34; - you just need to choose
    your colors very carefully &#40;assuming the font editor, not to mention the OS&#39;s
    font engine, allow colors&#41; so that they render on the RGB lcd cells in a way
    that triples the horizontal resolution. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    &#40;Benson Caps, Benson Linear&#41; all were born on the Palm Vx while riding
    trains to work.
