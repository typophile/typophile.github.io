  product will look far better if I use inDesign to adjust Word's somewhat clunky
  formatting. I now have a copy of inDesign, but no understanding of how to import
  Word documents and work with them. (Adobe's Help system doesn't seem geared toward
  importing and typesetting books.) Might anybody here be able to refer me to a suitable
  reference?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMichael"

    import options\" in the import window before you click OK. If you already have
    styles set up in Word, you can convert them directly to InDesign styles, as long
    as you define the InDesign styles before you import. However, if you've never
    designed a book in InDesign, you'll probably want a tutorial of some kind, as
    you mention. I'm afraid I can't think of any InDesign book design tutorials, though
    I would certainly recommend Bringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style as
    the best basic guide to book design. Incidentally, are you the author or the designer?
    Or is this a self-published piece? If it's self-published, then go right ahead
    and design it yourself, but as you probably know, a publisher would just want
    the Word files so they can have their own designers design your book. Hope this
    helps.\r\n\r\nJosh"

    Amazon. They are excellent tutorials.

    applications, too).\r\n\r\nYou have to be a member to view all their tutorials
    (which I think is well worth the money) but if you Google \"lynda.com discount
    code\" you can usually find codes for a one-week free trial."

  body: 'Also, not to put you down or anything: InDesign is not "a tool to adjust
    Word documents with". You would be rebuilding the entire document from scratch.
    All you get to start with is the plain text and most of the formatting.'

    to become editor, designer, typesetter (and depending on whether ink on paper
    or pixel on screen), printing broker.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you are going
    to submit the *manuscript* to a traditional publisher, you are far better off
    to leave it in MS Word."

  body: "If this book is your first InDesign project, I'd strongly suggest getting
    the assistance of someone who is proficient with InDesign to help you set up your
    files properly and get you started.\r\n\r\nInDesign is a complex program used
    primarily by graphic professionals, and there are many ways you could screw up
    if you make a rookie mistake. You need to properly set up master pages, auto page
    numbering, prepare and apply paragraph style sheets throughout & character style
    sheets, use \"space after\" settings rather than blank lines to separate paragraphs,
    need to set hyphenation & justification settings, \"keep\" options, maybe create
    a baseline grid, and on and on.\r\n\r\nI've used InDesign for years and I still
    screw up sometimes. Doing a book as your first project is just asking for problems
    unless you get some assistance. \r\n\r\n"

  body: 'If you''re intending on sending this to agents and editors, definitely don''t
    bother with InDesign. Stick to standard manuscript format (Times or Courier, double
    spaced, one inch margins, single sided) and you''ll be fine. What you might have
    to worry about are curly quotes, em dashes, and ellipses dropping out. Convert
    them to straight quotation marks, double hyphens, and three periods, respectively. '

    trouble with these characters. The quote marks are especially best left as U+2018,
    2019, 201C and 201D (e.g., \"curly\" quotes). There is no algorithm that can \"restore\"
    them -- try 'Twas the night before Christmas . . . And as long as the text editor
    at the publisher's office supports Unicode General Punctuation, it will support
    dashes as well. The ellipses are a different issue, some styles prefer the ellipsis
    character, others periods with varying spacing in between."
