  body: "Is this part of the hat or attached to the hat? If it's part of the hat the
    manufacturer probably has access to a special embroidery font. If it is separate,
    is there any indication as to manufacturer? Again looks like it would be a special
    design for the maker.\r\nWorth checking to see if anyone is claiming copyright
    for this design.\r\nBTW if you want to make it yourself, Kevin's suggestion is
    the way to go.\r\ndon"
