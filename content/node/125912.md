body: "A client wants to have their logotype in Collis Roman. I already own Quiosco
  from a previous project so I'm convincing them to use it instead: it's structurally
  similar but has more energy and weights. What sans serif would you pair with Quiosco
  for a lawayer firm?\r\nTIA"

  body: Allium looks good, better than News Gothic. Optima or Lydian seem too close
    to make a contrast.
