  body: "As I read the rule, \"Century family\" means \"a font with Century in the
    name,\" since that's the pattern of the fonts in the \"e.g.\" list.  But I wouldn't
    consider the e.g. list exhaustive \u2014\_certainly if the Supreme Court only
    wanted to accept those three Century variants, it would say so.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    only a numbnut lawyer would pick a Century that's outside the realm of the traditional
    Century look. However, there are still dozens of competing cuts of traditional
    Century designs. I haven't spent enough time with them to form an opinion about
    their relative merits.\r\n\r\nI haven't been contracted to figure this out. But
    I was talking to an attorney yesterday who was part of a team that was filing
    a petition in the Supreme Court. They had set everything in Times New Roman and
    at the last minute someone noticed the Century requirement. A scramble to find
    a Century font ensued. (Lesson: read the rules first.)\r\n\r\nThis isn't a mainstream
    issue in legal typography because relative to the profession as a whole, very
    few lawyers will ever file a document in the Supreme Court. But it's not trivial,
    either \u2014 about 8000 petitions are filed each year with the Supreme Court,
    all of which have to conform to the court's typographic requirements, which are
    the most detailed in the nation.\r\n\r\nTraditionalists will be glad to hear that
    the Supreme Court still endorses \"hot metal\" typesetting.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/33.html\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    looked at typographic rules from courts around the country, I can assure you that
    as a blanket proposition, this is wrong. It ranks with other popular misconceptions
    like \"judges prefer documents written in stodgy legalese.\"\r\n\r\nYes, there
    are courts that seem to be happy with the typewriter-based rules of 50 years ago.
    There are plenty of others that take it quite seriously. For example, Chief Judge
    Frank Easterbrook of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is a very well-respected
    jurist and also a fan of good typography:\r\n\r\nhttp://typo.la/7th\r\n\r\nAs
    I posted in another thread recently, the Utah Supreme Court recently redesigned
    its opinions with better typography:\r\n\r\nhttp://typo.la/ub\r\nhttp://typo.la/ua\r\n\r\nI've
    found that people outside the legal profession are more likely to be skeptical
    about the possibilities of legal typography than those inside it."

  body: "Having worked many years with GPO and assorted Government agency staffers,
    I can tell you that whatever rules are written, most are a result of some politically
    motivated compromise and have little bearing on what might be best.  The Century
    that you seek is one of the ones that the particular bureaucrat in question at
    that moment will approve. That rule came about during the Nancy Hanks era as the
    government overseer of all things design at the National Endowment for the Arts
    during the Nixon-Ford era.  She instituted what was known as the \"Federal Graphics
    Improvement Program\" in an attempt to have American Government documents look
    better than the \"anything goes\" garbage that had made US Gov. material the laughing
    stock of the World. Massimo Vignelli was hired by the Endowment to create standards
    for Congressional documents.  He chose Century (mostly \"expanded\" as per hot
    metal specimens) to print the Congressional Record and many other regular daily
    projects.  The GPO loving a chance to point out a rule from one bureaucrat to
    another, seized on the Manual done by Massimo and made it law of the land. Other
    Departments and agencies soon followed with their own \"Graphic Standards Manuals\"
    and by the 1980's order was made out of chaos. All of my work was with the Department
    of Agriculture at the time but I was acquainted with designers for all the agencies
    at the time. Years of arguing between entrenched bureaucrats who love a pissing
    contest.  What came out of it was not necessarily great design, but some consistency
    at least so that the average American could at least tell what a real government
    document looked like. Congress, in an attempt to prove how smart it was during
    the Energy Crisis of the 1970s, imposed many so-called cost and energy saving
    stipulations on all Govt. printing. Some of them were just plain silly.  My all-time
    favorite was when they changed the standard size of a page from 8.5\" x 11\" to
    8 3/8\" by 10 7/8\".  The sound bites rolling off the tongues of the members of
    the Congressional Joint Committee on Printing members in charge was, \"This will
    save X-billion tons of paper and energy each year while having no negative effect
    on anything.\"  They certainly did not check with the nations paper companies,
    printers, and suppliers, they just assumed that if you shaved an eighth of an
    inch of of every piece of paper, that all of that paper was truly \"saved\" not
    paid for and no energy spent for either. They had no idea that paper companies
    were not going o spend millions to change their production process or printers
    were not going to change press sizes and management practices just because some
    Senator said it was a good idea. So printers just charged extra for the labor
    of revising set-ups for government work from the norm and threw all that \"saved\"
    paper in the trash adding to waste in landfills. Congress was so proud of patting
    itself on the back for their cross-party supported wisdom that they refused to
    listen to ANYONE who said \"but...\". Everyone in the industry just kind of snickered
    and went along as usual but now had plenty of in-jokes to laugh at whilst they
    tilted their favorite brew. Congress was on a roll! They even outlawed the use
    of coated paper and color printing without special dispensation from the JCP.
    \ This was because of the use of natural gas dryers in some web-fed printing presses
    to speed up drying time. They certainly exaggerated the benefit of this far beyond
    the few cents it saved in reality because they could praise themselves for their
    brilliance in energy conservation.\r\n\r\nI see I have greatly digressed from
    the topic and I apologize for any errant innuendo I may have unwittingly written
    that may wrongly tarnish the brilliant history of congressional intelligence."

  body: I should have added that Century was chosen simply because GPO already had
    a large investment in mats and machines in that face so it was a case of what
    they had instead of what might be best.  GPO had a book of their own types and
    that was what was used as an "example".  Today, this is all meaningless with digital
    type and offset printing.  The Congressional Register and Congressional Record
    were printed in-house by GPO daily set in hot metal and printed letterpress--and
    yes, it was the 1970s. Today, everything is contracted out and nobody prints letterpress
    except the lovers of chic and the antiquated handiwork of our forefathers. I am
    sure Massimo would have preferred Helvetica or Bodoni but he was smart enough
    to know a battle that could not be won.
