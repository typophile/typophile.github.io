  body: "It would help if there was some information on the origin of these numbers,
    e.g.  rubber stamps.\r\nExcept for the $ sign, they look similar to house numbers.\r\nSimilar
    numbers are found in pre-WWI printers specimen books.\r\nAs for digital versions
    various typewriter fonts have some similarity.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag:typewriter/fonts/1-50/?sort=mob\">See
    list at myfonts</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=113&text=28035&fpp=50\">see
    list at dafont</a>.\r\nDon"
