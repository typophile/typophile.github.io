body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI am creating a logo and I need a nice heavy extended bold
  font and I have been having a close look at Microgramma D Bold Extended but I am
  having trouble with the \"R\", I think it looks kinda weird in this weight, anyone
  agree? Should I edit the \"R\" myself? Any comments? Suggestions? Similar font with
  nicer \"R\" perhaps?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMP\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03ed1ca8dd2193c93c7fe58f204261_4063.gif]"

    solutions used in \"futuristic\" typefaces. One example of which could be Orbitron

    think your suggestions work, the \"r\" certainly makes it look alot better thats
    for sure, Thanks for that!"

  body: Do you think if I was to make leg of the "R" straight rather than curved that
    this would solve the problem? Or will it potentially kill the font?
