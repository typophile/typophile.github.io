  hi-res. But that doesn't excuse the insane amounts of swirls. \r\n\r\nI'm sure it's
  a font (not necessarily all the swirliness). But if anyone can give me some insight
  on the base font it would be much appreciated. I've tried other outlets like whatthefont
  and identifont, but to no avail.\r\n\r\n*cracks knuckles*\r\n\r\nI guess i should
  start tracing in illustrator.\r\n\r\n"
