  a lot from you all!  I am a student in graphic design and am taking my first course
  ever on Typography.  I cannot refer to my book yet simply because it has not been
  delivered yet. It's really interesting that there is more to it than what people
  realize.\r\nSo far I have searched through the forums topics to find information
  I needed on DIN 1451.  Thank you ALL!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have another question
  that I cannot find simply because, my book has not came in yet but need to know
  a few things.  I am just ignorant to what this means for my project I must do.\r\n\r\nIf
  you would like to help keep on reading =)\r\n\r\nI have to retype some paragraphs
  in a specified way, but some of the instructions I not understand and hope someone
  can explain to me what it means.\r\n\r\nfirst:\r\n\r\nI must \"comp\" a word twice.
  \ What does \"Comp\" mean?\r\n\r\nMy headline must be 72 points Baseline to Baseline.
  \ (O.o) To me, baseline is the bottom line in which the type \"sits\" on, so do
  you understand how it could be Baseline to Baseline?\r\n\r\nSecond:\r\n\r\nFlush
  left, Rag Right.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help that would ROCK!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Baseline to Baseline refers to leading (although I don't understand why they
    didn't just call it leading). It applies to headlines of more than one line.\r\n\r\nFlush
    left/Rag right means that the type aligns on its left side and not on the right,
    like the type on this forum."

    does \u201CComp\u201D mean?\r\n\r\nComp, from comprehensive (I think) means to
    sketch the word out to show the design. At least in the old days it was sketched
    out. Your instructor may be looking for something from the computer, which is
    a more common way to comp these days."
