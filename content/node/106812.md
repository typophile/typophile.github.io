  anyone give me a hand in identifying this monospaced typewriter font?\r\nI've so
  far found a couple of close candidates, specifically URW Typewriter und Klim Pitch,\r\nbut
  none are a complete match.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nCh"

  body: myfonts.com; search for "Typewriter" and look at the typewriter fonts from
    Monotype which should appear as the first search result. One of them looks to
    be a very close match to your sample.
