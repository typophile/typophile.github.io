body: Lately I've been having some trouble identifying type that some publications
  are using. The two examples shown here are from Wired magazine. Anyone know what
  family these two belong to? If so, what type foundry are they from?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_typophile_wired_01_5742.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_typophile_wired_02_3463.jpg]

  body: I apologize for assuming Typophile's search was sufficient. Maybe they ought
    to disable it and just provide a link to the site-specific Google search.

    and much more stuff comes up.

    the font used in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" movie title, I tried typophile's
    search but got nothing, tried Google & got instant results of course.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a link:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/5530\r\n\r\nP.S. the font was also
    used in \"Into the Arms of Strangers\" documentary title."

    bookmark with the snippet, rename bookmark to something like "Typophile Search"

  body: I've mentioned it once before, but I figured I'd advocate it again now that
    the conversation has resurfaced. I use <a href=yubnub.org>YubNub</a>, which is
    a "(social) command line for the web." I've integrated it into my address bar,
    so when I type "gim porsche," IE searches Google Images for porsches, and when
    I type "am Bringhurst," Amazon pops up with the matches. I made the command "typophile,"
    which works in the same way, searching Typophile.com through Google. So typing
    "typophile wired magazine" would do the same thing as what has been mentioned.
    The advantage of YubNub over the javascript is that there's no need to use a links
    or favorites bar if you don't use them normally (like I don't). Having it in my
    address bar has made my life a little bit easier (using commands like "myfonts,"
    "veertype," and "fontshop" to search those sites for fonts).

    Thanks for pointing it out, though. I wonder if acidsearch would work with Safari
    on PC ...\r\n\r\nLooking at the website, the functionality is similar to YubNub's,
    although YubNub seems easier to design your own commands for (since it uses a
    simplified syntax that even <em>I</em> can learn). "
