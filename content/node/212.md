  body: Actually, it&#39;s Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/belizio/"
    target="_blank"> Belizio</a> that is based on Aldo Novarese&#39;s Egizio,  <BR>which
    in turn traces its roots back to the Clarendons of the mid 19th century.  <BR>The
    Clarendon style evolved out of the general &#34;Egyptian&#34;/slab-serif styles  <BR>popularized
    by Figgins and Thorne/Thorowgood. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza/"
    target="_blank"> Giza</a> and the example above both derive more from the Egyptian
    style directly  <BR>than they do the Clarendon/Egizio lineage. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    the actual <b>Eglentine</b> font? ;&#41;
