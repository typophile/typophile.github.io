  the very first page you come to, look at the welcome line in gold.  I need to know
  what font 'BACARDI' is written in as a client has seen it and likes it.  I'm sure
  I've used this before for something else but can't put my finger on it!  Any help
  - greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nA."

      it's the BA at the beginning that I recognise as familiar...\r\n\r\nANT:ONY"
