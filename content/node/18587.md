  body: Still can't find a match. There are others in this French upright script genre,
    but I think the best is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=2&displayfontid=ITC.9082.0.0&fontRendererText=Betsy+Stephens">Fling</a>.

  body: "Patty and Mike's discussion on the Pamela Mann script i.d. thread made me
    remember this sample book I have that shows various engraved lettering styles.
    Check this out:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coronet-engraving.gif]\r\n\r\nAs
    near as I can tell, this is an exact match. Unfortunately, engraving styles like
    this are not fonts in the normal sense, more like patterns for engravers to trace.
    There are loads of interesting designs in the sample book I have, but none of
    the samples show more than a few characters, like this one."
