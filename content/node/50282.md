body: "There is no doubt that I am a DRG fan, and I have been looking for I don't
  know how many years for a font that comes closest to the one used by the german
  railways in the period of approx. 1900 - 1945\r\n\r\nI read about the work of Albert-Jan
  Pool on FF DIN fonts that he created and I am also trying to contact him regarding
  work he is doing on making a real KPEV/DRG font (I believe it is going to be called
  FF DIN Industrial).\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas regarding this subject, I will
  be delighted to read about it here. The subject articles that inspired me to write
  on the forum here are:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.svettisku.cz/buxus/docs/TYPO_2005_17.pdf?buxus_svettisku=f3f3\r\n\r\nhttp://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&language=en&issue=13&page=32\r\n\r\nhttp://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&language=en&issue=14&page=12\r\n\r\nhttp://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&language=en&issue=15&page=76\r\n\r\nhttp://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&language=en&issue=17&page=10\r\n\r\nhttp://www.magwerk.com/mag.php?magazine=encore&language=en&issue=18&page=14\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  font closest to the real thing of the old railways is DIN 1451 Engschrift, what
  I have found. Any better ideas are welcome."
