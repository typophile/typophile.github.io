  myself - I am stuck. I would really apreciate it if any of you could take a look
  and see if you recognize it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "I think you are right.\r\n\r\nDoh! I knew it would be something embarrassingly
    simple like this. Thanks.\r\nUnivers is one of those amazing typefaces that whenever
    someone else sets it, it looks superb - whenever I use it, it looks clunky and
    terrible.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot pattyfab! I appreciate it."
