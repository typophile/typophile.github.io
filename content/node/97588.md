  font from an old comic artbook \"\"Book of the Damned\" by Epic Comics (printed
  in 1990-s). It resembles slightly retro fonts like GrandeGuignol but that one is
  not the same.\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tarot2_4588.jpg] "

    my Atari back before I got my first Mac. I searched Dafont in the 'Gothic' category,
    but I am not sure what this might be classified.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "bowfinpw, thank you for prompting, I found in this category one similar font
    named The love you find in hell by Rory Minchin-King - \r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/the-love-you-find-in-hell.font\r\nbut
    glyphs in that font differ a bit from the sample (they lack those thin serifs).
    Does someone know, maybe there is another version of this font from the same designer,
    or another font created by someone else but based on The love you find in hell?
    (I guess such a font must be not younger than 1990-s). \r\n"
