    Now it merely trades on its notoriety and has declined into circumspect boredom.

    More like floghelveticatoapulp.com. <BR> <BR>I think the &#34;problem&#34; with
    the bancomicsans people is actually remorse. Weak.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: while comic sans is among my least favorite of faces and i readily agree that
    it is very often misused &#40;i saw it in a wedding announcement!&#41; my beef
    that i have against the ban comic sans people is that they use the image of the
    creator of the font in their propoganda. i hate comic sans &#40;it makes me gag&#41;
    but we should respect the person who created it and not deface his image. i&#39;m
    staging a personal boycot of the face, however. <BR>there are some who want to
    ban Bookman Swash and in effect it has been since it&#39;s fairly hard to find
    &#40;i know where to purchase it, ya don&#39;t hafta point it out to me&#41; but
    personally there&#39;s one face that i love to see used &#40;maybe it&#39;s because
    its used all over the place in my church on books, music, etc.&#41; Anyhow, there&#39;s
