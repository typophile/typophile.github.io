body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI have a large client that is using 'Ideal Sans' as their main
  font for system generated forms (generated via custom built industry proprietary
  software). \r\nThe client has invested a good deal of time and money into having
  these forms designed and now developed. \r\nThe problem is that the developer has
  not been able to get 'tabular lining' or 'lining figures' to work, and it's messing
  up the design. \r\nHoefler customer service has been of no help to the client, the
  designer, or the developer. \r\nThe client is now asking for a recommendation for
  an alternative font to replace all of the numbers in the design.\r\nThey would like
  a True Type font that has lining characters by default that would successfully complement
  Ideal Sans in aesthetic. \r\n\r\nAny help, assistance, or recommendations would
  be greatly appreciated! "

  body: "For whatever reason, the software is causing Ideal Sans to default to old-style,
    or non-aligning, numerals.\r\n\r\nThe problem isn't the typeface, but how the
    proprietary software is interpreting the Open Type font. Ideal Sans includes lining,
    tabular, and old-style versions of the numbers, and only the old-style version
    is visible to CaterXpert.\r\n\r\nSarala, a Google web font, might be a solution:\r\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarala"

  body: That, or they could have Ideal Sans customised to default to tabular/lining
    numbers if they want to stick with it.
