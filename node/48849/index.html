<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone have rave reviews of a particular laser printer, photo printer or scanner? I've been digging through cnet and its really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff (often the user reviews don't jive with those of the editors...stupid users or glad handed editors?).
I'm fine with buying each of these separately but is there a multifunction that does all three or two of the three well? Cardstock? Duplexing?
BTW the wiki on this is lacking, so maybe we could get a start with this thread.

<div class=commentbody>What are you looking to do with each? All three items come in a wide range of functions and prices.
And never, ever get a multifunction machine for design work. They’re made to save space, not do quality work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks James,
I'm a digital photographer so I'd like to have something to print high quality photos.
But my most pressing needs require a good scanner (for digitizing source material for design work) and a printer for printing proofs of work I'm doing on books and possibly one that I could use to print chapbook covers (we can't always afford letterpress) and body. Though I'm not sure we'd be saving money with that strategy.
I'd also like a printer that I don't have to plug in to my computer so it can sit in another part of the room (I work from home and space is limited).
I'm willing to spend around $500 for each item. Or would you recommend spending more on the printer and less on the scanner?

<div class=commentbody>Well, when it comes to scanning you really need to think about the final output: are your pieces printed well enough that better scans will result in better prints? And are you scanning really great color photos to begin with? I prefer Epson scanners—the drivers and scanning software are the best around, the output is always great, they’re fast, and you can buy them refurbished at Epson.com to save a lot. Whatever you do, don’t go near HP scanners, the output, drivers, and software are all terrible.
Right now I’m really sick of printers. I’ve been using Epson inkjets for about five years now and I can’t recommend the new models unless your output is mostly glossy photo printouts. Epson’s newer Stylus printers (at least the sub $1000 models I’ve used) don’t work worth a damn. The sheet feeders are terrible, and on uncoated stocks streaking is common, even with Epson’s expensive inks and papers. Given the premium prices an Epson is only worth buying if you have an unpaid intern to keep it working. I’ve heard really great things about the new Canon printers, and Canon ink is cheap, so give them a look. You can find the best printer reviews on digital photo sites.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks again James.
I'm mostly scanning things that I will be manipulating and often vectorizing. I'll definitely take a look at the Epsons (didn't know you could get them refurbished! good tip) and the Canon printers.

<div class=commentbody>I haven’t used that one, but my current scanner is the v100, and the scans it outputs are as good or better than what I was getting with the old Perfection 16xx series scanners.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I ended up going with the Canon Canoscan 8800F. It was a tossup between that and the Epson V500. <a href=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2329068,00.asp target=_blank>The review at PC Mag</a> claimed slightly better image quality in the 8800 though support for film scanning is better on the V500. </div>
