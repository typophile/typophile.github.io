  a msword 2004 text file.\r\nThe text file i already got from the client.\r\nDoes
  Msword support Arabic text?( my own hunch says no)\r\nHow can i insert the text
  in a Indesign document, without loosing its nature?\r\nDoes anyone have a backdoor
  trick? \r\nGreetings base\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello, base,\r\n\r\nI spent 5 years doing multilingual DTP for a translation
    agency... I can't stress this enough: <strong>Arabic is very, very tricky to typeset...</strong>
    And MS Word is not the best program in the world for working with Arabic! You
    will try to select a character on the right end of a line and will end up selecting
    the one on the left side... Periods will not behave the way you expect them to...
    I could go on and on. For any lengthy text, the best thing to do is to send the
    job to a designer or production artist who knows and works with Arabic text on
    a daily basis... There are just too many things that can go wrong if you try to
    do it yourself. And Arabic typesetters are scarce, so they can charge you a bundle!\r\n\r\nFlorian
    already mentioned InDesign ME... There is also Illustrator ME... These versions
    of the Adobe apps were made to deal with right-to-left typesetting (<em>i.e.</em>,
    Arabic, Hebrew). If you have to do the job yourself, try to use one of these programs...
    Using a Western version of MS Word will just give you non-stop headaches. I kid
    you not."
