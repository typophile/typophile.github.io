  on projects where you have a vested interest can be a horrible pain at times. \r\nSo,
  at this point, I've pretty much exhausted my brain and am looking for some outside
  opinions. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTom"

    angles or placement?  Also, with the letters tracked apart so far, the leaves
    overlapping feel cluttered where they are. '

  body: "The logo looks overly delicate to me. It most certainly doesn't say \"development\"
    in any conceivable way. \"Design\" - maybe, but it has far more of .. erm .. a
    \"healthy living\" or a \"spa\" feeling to it than a web design.\r\n"

  body: "I agree with epsilicon. It feels a bit like it's advertising upmarket Aloe
    Vera health/beauty products (especially with those leaves); or colored contact
    lenses. \r\nWhere do the leaves come from?"
