    What Mr. Daniels fails to reveal however is that those values are not percentages,
    they are in fact the exact numbers of OTF versus TTF fonts produced. On Thursday.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that the numbers I provided would have been made up. I''m interested to know how

    options are presented.\r\n\r\nSome foundries only make one or the other. In which
    case it is usually OTF for professional graphics/publishing users and mostly TTF
    for office users.\r\n"
