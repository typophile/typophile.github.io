  to identify it. Now that I want to find an example, I can only find this header
  on this site:\r\nhttp://www.jimmyturrell.com/\r\nHe's a great illustrator anyway,
  so check out the great work. But thetype in quest is his name/header. The small
  x height and so exaggerated cap and ascender height is quite striking. Otherwise
  he is reminiscent of century gothic and the like.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for taking
  any time with this!\r\n\r\nLewis"

  body: "Thanks a lot guys. I love Planeta, and gestalten fonts look great, so good
    find for me.\r\nNeutraface 2 Display Bold is a very close match though, it could
    be the one.\r\nBoth are welcome alternatives to Futura, I am finding that it finally
    seems decidedly dated to me \u2013 just find it a lot harder to use lately as
    opposed to even a few years back (NonFormat manage to use it well though). Both
    of these alternatives assert a more modern presence whilst retaining the overal
    character you get with Futura, so I'll have to get at least one of these."
