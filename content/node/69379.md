body: "Hey yall, I was hoping to get some feedback or suggestions. I am currently
  in the process of creating a logo for a not for profit organization named Mercy
  Air, that provides helicopters and airplanes so that villages in remote areas of
  Africa can receive aid and resources, not just the easy to access places. The mark
  is still being edited, but the basic idea is there. My issue is with the font, I
  cannot seem to pick a font that says \"mercy\". I am trying to convey too much?
  Would it be better to keep it clean/contemporary and use a simple sans serif, or
  should I try to \"fancy\" it out? Any comments and suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nupdate:

  body: "I would suggest an eco font (one with holes) or something unicase (e.g. <a
    href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/panoptica.html\">Panoptica</a>).\r\nThe omission
    of redundant material signifies a carefulness with resources.\r\nNot \"mercy\",
    but you already said that in text, and IMO practicality is a more appropriate
    attitude than pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Given the \"aid\" aspect of the logo, I would go for a \"reassuring\" typeface.
    Something solid which supports the lightness of the humming bird.\r\n(speaking
    of which, while a very good idea in itself, I think could be revised to resemble
    less a crucified penguin... ;-)"

  body: "Thanks guys, I think the eco font is a good idea, as well as the sans bold
    unicase that you provided nick. For some reason the dissonance/stress that the
    upper/lowercase mix creates goes well with the feeling of urgeny I might try to
    go for. Otherwise I will stick to the solid/reassuring method of a clean simple
    sans. Any quick hints on what to adjust ricardo? It's not near completion yet,
    I usually spend ours refining logo paths, just looking for a starting point.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Were you serious about the eco font, Nick? :) I agree on the + (signals death
    in cartoons). I also tend to pick something with a soft feel to it, and usually
    something humanistic, whenever the subject of the project is humans.

    it works).\r\nAs for the picture, here a possible inspiration:\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/a_new_eagle_guacamaya_for_taca.php\r\n\r\nAs
    for the cross shape, if needed, you could rather incorporate (or suggest) it in
    the general shape of the logo."

  body: "What Craig said (and Frode). The cross makes the bird look dead, even if
    that's obviously not the intention.\r\n\r\nType: It's certainly good not to make
    it too organic or brushy (and no Optima). It might seem over-the-top and potentially
    tacky (besides not matching the style of the bird). \xABMercy\xBB is a strong
    word and I'm thinking the type might have to be a bit reserved.\r\nSo reassuring
    is good, simple is good, but: don't make it cold, or slick/corporate. \r\nA few
    of your options could work but maybe you're not entirely there yet\u2026 I could
    well imagine a friendly but serious wedge-serif (for the \xABreassuring\xBB bit)
    but with a bit of modulation and some roughness, to make it less monolithic /
    more human. Something in the general direction of <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/Skolar\">Skolar</a>
    or <a href=\"http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=207\">Malaga</a>?\r\n\r\nAnd dunno,
    but I wouldn't put a font with holes on a plane."

    caps of Optima are stronger and less feminine than the lower case, and may strike
    the right balance for you. '

  body: "<em>Were you serious about the eco font, Nick?</em>\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. \r\nIf
    you're serious about selling your work to the client (the \"rationale\"), ya gotta
    walk the talk, or eat your own dogfood, as it it sometimes phrased, or else you're
    just bullshitting.\r\nFine artists have been doing this for decades, to the extent
    that the concept becomes the main focus, and the actual \"work\" relatively inconsequential.\r\nThe
    eco font is a worthy successor to Chalet and Starling."

  body: "Optima for me has a very neutral appeal. Some might see this as a negative,
    some might see it as a plus in terms of universal acceptance. I closely relate
    it to a military sense since it is used on war memorials, and in some presidential
    campaigns. Although I think it works well on its own, I would rather evade these
    connotations.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of unitype fonts that I can look at? I like
    the ones that Nick has listed, but I think I need one step bolder and lighter
    of the sans version.\r\n\r\nA wedge serif seams to be a good solution, I am just
    trying to find some good ones. I have a font called topaz (shown above) but it's
    all caps, and I don't know if I like that for such a suggestive typeface.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of the symbol, it's a hummingbird because a. it's a bird (flies) b. it hovers
    (like a helicopter) c. The body is meant to be Africa. \r\n\r\nI know it's not
    really fleshed out yet, but it's only a start."

  body: 'Honestly, I don''t think it has associations with military. Only designers
    will even remember that McCain used it. It has been used for 60 years on cosmetics,
    and if anything has more of that association. But I think the caps just look classic,
    though more gentle than Trajan.  '
