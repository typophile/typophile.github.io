    body: I have a long scar on my abdomen and in the '80s thought of having a Schaedler
      rule tattoed over it--might come in handy. But then I decided that guys might
      find that intimidating . . . and you imagine sitting there for all those 1/128
      marks?

    art. Eventually I matured enough to design everything myself.\r\n\r\nI also learned
    to never trust a tattoo artist's Chinese translation.\r\n"

    scar down my chest and another on my leg from my quadruple bypass a few years
    back.  It is the closest thing I have to a tatoo but it ain't pretty."

  body: "I do enough tatooing on my self in the kitchen. Thats why I only have Gazpacho
    during the summer. \r\n\r\nOn another subject its simple surup time. Regular sugar
    doesn't desolve in Ice Tea and Ice Coffee. Simple Surup is One Part boiling water
    to One Part Sugar. Once you've made it put it in the frig and it will stay separated.
    I usually make about 1 1/2 cups at a time."

    Body Type: Intimate Messages Etched in Flesh</a> is due out in September. I wonder
    how many typographers will be pictured inside. I also wonder if there's any way
    a few advanced copies could be availabe at TypeCon in August.\r\n"

  body: The last time I talked to Ina about the book she was hoping that she would
    at least have some page proofs to show by Typecon, but she thought it might be
    a little early to have any books ready. We can cross our fingers, though...
