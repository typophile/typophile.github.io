  University of Washington uses them for all of their athletic teams. It might be
  a custom-drawn font.\r\n\r\nAlso -- on the attached sweatshirt logo, the \"1960\",
  can someone identify that font?  I seen those digits before, but I have no clue
  where.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/WASH Hoodie_4331.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/WA-logos_5664.jpg]"
