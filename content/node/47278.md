  body: "Can you recommend fonts that have this kind of feel but are better crafted?
    I am shopping around for a font to brand a technology company but it needs to
    be very approachable and friendly. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "thank you, stephen! if you were to recommend a really expensive font in this
    kind of category what would it be? while i do like roice and bryant a bit i still
    feel like these look too ordinary and i need something that looks very distinctive
    yet very simple. am i asking too much? \r\n\r\nthank you for you help. i've been
    really struggling with this one. "

    something from scratch which would be best. \r\n\r\nWhat could do is find a typeface
    that has the basis of what you want and then customize it (or hire someone to
    customize it)."
