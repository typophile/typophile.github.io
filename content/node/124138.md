    correction for perspective and skew[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CacaoCulturaSM@90_3426.jpg]\r\nAbout
    the closest I can find to the unmodified letters is Hurme Geometric Sans No.3
    Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HurmeGeometricSansNo3BoldAsCACAO_5941.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/HurmeGeometricSansNo3BoldAsCULTURA_4439.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-3/\r\nMake an arc
    for the crossbar on _A_, drop the bowl on _R_ and use a segment of the arc to
    make the leg. Most readers would not notice any difference from the logo but minor
    other adjustments could be made for an even closer match.\r\nDon\r\n"

    Black or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/circe|Circe]] (really like this
    one).'
