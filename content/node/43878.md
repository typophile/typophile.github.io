  body: "An exceptionally fresh and alluring family...note the roman lower case a
    and y (second line \"rapidly\" in sample below), the very crisp roman fi ligature
    (\"figures\" at end of 4th line), the well-judged spacing after the oldstyle figure
    for one, and especially the well-contrasted bold and bold italics (two bolder
    weights follow). The OpenType version is quite affordable at current sale prices
    (how about making those permanent??) and, God bless him, all the fonts are keystroke-linked!
    Bravo Ludwig...a distinguished debut on the world type stage...we're looking for
    more from you!\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marat_5613.png]"
