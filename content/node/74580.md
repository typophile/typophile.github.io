  it in all web-resources I know, with no success. Is there anybody willing to post
  me a rapidshare link, hence I am not willing to pay almost 200\u20AC for the font
  Family.\r\n\r\nthx!"

    sure your clients understand, is that fonts don\u2019t grow on trees.\r\nThey
    cost money, just as software and work."

    you asking us to help you steal, you are also posting under full name and (website)
    address.

    salaries, time spent is three times as much because all has to be learned. And
    fonts are extremely expensive. Full risk, no guarantees.\r\n\r\nI will use free
    fonts from now on. And may it's time for an internship in a serious typographers

  body: "If you tell us what you want to use it for, perhaps we can offer some suggestions.
    Most projects won\u2019t require a full family either, so that might lower the
    cost for you. You can\u2019t purchase single weights of Akzidenz Grotesk, but
    a lot of other foundries will let you with their fonts. \r\n\r\nWhen I hear people
    say \u201CI am not willing to pay $$$ for fonts!\u201D I suspect they\u2019ve
    grown custom to the idea that fonts aren\u2019t valuable. A typical font collection
    (among freeloaders) might consist of thousand of fonts. The thought of paying
    for all that seems daunting at first, but great designers don\u2019t become great
    because they have a lot of fonts."

  body: "<cite>And fonts are extremely expensive. </cite>\r\n\r\nNo. Some might have
    a higher price tag than others, but they are almost always worth the expense.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesk/?refby=mfde\">URW Grotesk</a>
    is an often overlooked alternative from the same genre. You can pick single weights
    for $19.95, or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesk/urw-grotesk-t-regular/buy.html?refby=mfde\">license
    the whole thing</a> (59 fonts!*) for as little as $99.\r\n\r\n*) That number is
    bloated, as small caps come as separate fonts. There are both italics and obliques
    for some weights (you don\u2019t need the latter), and certain styles seem \u2013\_apart
    from the spacing \u2013\_identical to me (see Condensed Light vs. Condensed Extralight).
    Also, the characterset might not be up to par with recent OpenType releases. Still,
    you get a pretty decent and versatile Grotesk workhorse, for a small budget."

  body: Linotype have a version of Akidenz Grotesk (based on the original which was
    drawn long before digital fonts came into existence) called [[http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html|Basic
    Commercial]]. They offer single weights.
