    nor <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/raleigh/" target="_blank">
    Raleigh</a>, and certainly not <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sistina-lt/"
    target="_blank"> Sistina</a> which hasn&#39;t  <BR>got any lowercase. <BR> <BR>That
    peculiar lc &#34;r&#34; looks very familiar, as does the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;g&#34;,  <BR>but
    I don&#39;t know&#40;yet&#41; what it is.

    of his faces...

    target="_blank"> Gill Facia</a>. If it&#39;s not  <BR>one of his designs, then
    at least it&#39;s heavily influenced by him.

  body: The more I look at it, the more I think it&#39;s a freeware/shareware  <BR>font.
    There&#39;s stuff in there that doesn&#39;t jibe... dunno.

  body: Perhaps also influenced by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/weiss/"
    target="_blank">Weiss</a>? See the M for example. But Weiss doesn&#39;t have the
    funky r.

  body: Yves, I tend to agree with you. That l.c.&#39;r&#39; looks like a rather awkward
    modification. Does it really look familiar to you? The font is very monotone,
    and the &#39;g&#39; doesn&#39;t look like it fits well. The closest &#39;g&#39;
    I found to that so far has been <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/titus-ef/"
    target="_blank">David Quay&#39;s Titus</a>. Not much else about Titus looks close,
    though. I still haven&#39;t found anything else with that &#39;r&#39;.

  body: <i>&#62; Does it really look familiar to you?</i> <BR> <BR>Well, I did an
    extensive research on free- and shareware  <BR>typefaces a little over two years
    ago, and lots of faces are  <BR>still stocked in the lesser visited regions of
    my brain. I don&#39;t  <BR><i>really</i> need to know them &#40;too much chaff
    amongst the  <BR>wheat&#41;. So often a face looks familiar and when it gets  <BR>IDed
    it turns out it&#39;s one of those free- or shareware faces.

  body: Thank you very much for your comments. <BR> <BR>I have to apologize that I
    sent you on a wild goose chase. The author of the preprint would not disclose
    the name or source of the font, but after showing him your responses, he owned
    up to the fact that it is his own work. It is loosely based on a sample from an
    old hand-lettering book, based in turn on the inscription on the Trajan column.
