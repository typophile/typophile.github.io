		<div class="commentbody"><i>&gt;I meant text font. It was his first there, right?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, you're right about that. <BR> <BR><i>&gt;How so?</i> <BR> <BR>Because he was talking about increasing legibility in a 7-point design (&quot;I am just cuckoo enough to be intrigued by this problem of getting a thundering big character on a 7-point body&quot;). Would you not agree that larger x-heights and shorter extenders become more important in sub-reading sizes, below 8 point? Dwiggins said, &quot;It is surprising how little descenders and ascenders have to do with *legibility* as such.&quot; [WAD's emphasis]. That &quot;as such,&quot; I think, is an important qualifier in this context. In Gerard Unger's <i>Quaerendo</i> article, noting differences of opinion on this matter, he said, &quot;Personally, I go along with Dwiggins.&quot; Will you now declare Unger to be also lacking in logic? <BR> <BR>I'm not arguing here that extenders don't play an important role. I think Dwiggins may indeed have underestimated this. But you seem to consistently overplay the importance of this one statement, taking it out of the context of small sizes and parading it out as if it summarized Dwiggins's whole theory of readability, or some such, and then declaring that therefore he must not have taken type design seriously. <BR> <BR>(As I re-read WAD's original letter, I do see that he makes some connection between this observation of the newsface and his interest with uncial forms. And I will concede that I think this latter obsession was misguided and distracting.) <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, I do not think that it is fair to say that Dwiggins didn't think extenders played an important role and *therefore*, <i>ipso facto,</i> he was not logical. That's a big leap. It seems to me like saying that Newton was lacking in logic because he insisted that light was a particle. <BR> <BR>&gt;Any type designer (after Javal) isn't taking things seriously when he <BR>&gt;thinks x-height is all that matters. Conclusions derive directly from <BR>&gt;understanding, and not having understanding is largely one's own <BR>&gt;fault. But since Dwiggins didn't seem to have the mettle for it, maybe <BR>&gt;it was excusable?  <BR> <BR>*Sigh*. Hrant, this seems unnecessarily defamatory. Why must you always be so polemical? So you disagree with some of Dwiggins's thoughts; so you don't think he ever designed anything to best his first text typeface &ndash; can't you just leave it at that? Why must you attack his character?  <BR> <BR>It seems to me that Dwiggins was one of the more *thinking* type designers of his era, exploring ideas, examining and analyzing. The fact that he did not always draw the same conclusions as you should not mean that he lacked logic or the &quot;mettle&quot; for understanding. <BR> <BR>The fact that he was not able to embody some of his theories about type into a successful design should not necessarily diminish the value of his thinking about type. (Beware, lest the same charge be levelled at you.;-) <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

Et tu, Kentus?  ;-) <BR> <BR>&gt; ipso facto, he was not logical. <BR> <BR>I'm not basing my view of him on that one statement. And there's no such thing as &quot;illogical&quot; (except in the formal realm, of which humans don't partake), just more or less logical. <BR> <BR>&gt; like saying that Newton was lacking in logic because he insisted that light was a particle.  <BR> <BR>The qualitative difference is that Newton didn't have the information to see his mistake (or half-mistake). Dwiggins had Javal. And we have Bouma. No more excuses. <BR> <BR>&gt; Why must you attack his character? <BR> <BR>Because it's educational.

		<div class="commentbody">What does the M-Formula have to do with intuition? It was based on <i>observation</i> and <i>experience</i> in his work with marionettes. <BR> <BR> <BR>Kent, I think Hrant always insists on attacking peoples' character because he is a deeply insecure individual who needs to make himself feel superior to others. Perhaps because his own flaws are so deeply embedded in his personality, he's become convinced that all flaws are flaws of personality; so if someone disagrees with him it must be because that person is 'psychologically weak' or has some similar fault of character. This is why his hermeneutics are always so wide of the mark: he never considers that the other person might <i>not</i> be pathological, let alone that the other person might be at least partly correct, or correct within the context that Hrant ignores to impose his own context. Note that none of this is intended as an attack on Hrant's own character. Even if it were, I hope he has 'the maturity to withstand it'.</div>

I'm sure you'll all agree that each one can lead to exactly the same results. <BR> <BR>What's important is the transmission of the technique afterwards. If your product is based on pure intuition, you're probably going to have to take on a very bright apprentice and show him/her how you work. With a lot of observation and experience they might pick it up, if they've got the mettle. With a product based on purely logical reasoning, you should be able to write it all down and teach it to 500 kids in an amphitheatre. <BR>In my very humble opinion, I think good type design (like most things) is a healthy combination of both intuition and logic.

		<div class="commentbody">I do not think much of the P22 font, much as I generally admire Rich's work. I would not have chosen the model that he did. Paul Shaw, who has spent twenty years studying Dwiggins's work &ndash; especially his lettering (from which this font derives) &ndash; feels that it lacks the quality of the original calligraphy.  <BR> <BR>Tiffany has kindly provided a rather thorough (if a bit hard to decipher &ndash; on the Mac anyway) brief on the Winchester &quot;half-uncial&quot;. And a lovely close-up. <BR> <BR>I will add that Dwiggins designed a more conventional uncial, Experimental No. 264, and a half-uncial companion to the first Falcon design, before the Winchester. Neither of these was completed. The Winchester was completed, along with a conventional roman and italic, but never released to the trade. Fonts of Winchester were cast for hand-setting and used by Dwiggins and Dorothy Abbe at their Püterschein-Hingham press for several books, mostly of Dwiggins's stories (which I believe is what is shown in the first image Tiffany posted above). <BR> <BR>The uncial experiments have not been a focus of my research (yet), so I can't say much more about them with any real authority. Personally, I do think it was an essentially futile attempt at &quot;alphabet reform&quot; and a distraction in the latter part of Dwiggins's career. But Tiffany's right, there are some interesting aspects to the letterforms themselves, from what I've seen. <BR> <BR>Here's an interesting tidbit: &quot;Such a letter should not break too sharply with the roman we are used to: it should take our reading habit as a starting point, and make use of as many of the familiar shapes as possible.&quot; If I didn't know better, I'd say that sounded like another zealous alphabet reformer I know. ;-) <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>
