  body: Since John comes from both the analog and digital sides <BR>of letter making
    it would be nice to get his take on both methods.  <BR>Is his true passion in
    lettering or type design, and why? Will  <BR>digital fonts ever be able to imitate
    the flexibility and  <BR>organic nature of hand made letters through technologies
    like  <BR>randomizing and OpenType?

  body: What digital tools does he use? I&#39;ve been told he&#39;s still Fogging
    and I&#39;m curious if he&#39;ll be moving to FLAB and OT featured faces . . .

    and you couldn&#39;t have made it in FOG. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si'

  body: A few years?!? My how time must fly. Wasn&#39;t much OT available three years
    ago as far as I recall, Adobe hadn&#39;t yet finished the line. And Emigre was
    hardly the first on the bandwagon. <BR> <BR>Gerald <BR>

  body: '&#62;A few years?!?  <BR> <BR>Well, more than two - font was released on
    13 May 2002... <BR>  <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2559"

    <BR> <BR>But maybe it doesn&#39;t count as it was done outside of the Emigre factory.
