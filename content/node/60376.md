body: Is there some proper way in OpenType to change a punctuation mark that usually
  cames in superscript or subscript form by default in the fonts to an "uppercase"
  version? Like the asterisk, that in some context may look better if looks lining
  and I don't know if the U+2217 ASTERISK OPERATOR character is appropriate to use
  in all cases, since a glyph variant of the default asterisk is much likely to be
  used. Same with the quotation marks ornaments encoded in the dingbats block (U+275B,
  U+275C, U+275D and U+275E), since <a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3565.pdf">a
  recent proposal</a> for "low" version for these characters for use in German and
  other languages was accepted, with the rationale that these characters are not merely
  glyphs variants for compatibility with the Zapf Dingbats font but rater to markup
  quotations in a prominent way, as in pull quotes. But in those cases, when the quotes
  are used inside the text instead of floating around, they use the uppercase size
  mostly, as seen in the examples of the proposal.
