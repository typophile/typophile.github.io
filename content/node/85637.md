  near Philadelphia, PA.  They seem to be inspired by Will Bradley, but I can not
  confirm that.\r\n\r\nThanks for any assistance in identifying them.\r\n\r\nI am
  having difficulty attaching an image, so I uploaded an image here:\r\nhttp://www.yourantiques.com/LititzInitials.jpg\r\n\r\nLee

  body: Bradley himself produced "clip art" for a time; these examples may well be
    cast from stereotypes of similar art, and thus may not necessarily be a specific
    typeface.
