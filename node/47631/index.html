		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oh no, people are going to think that I&rsquo;m some sort of eco-monster because of the Apple purchasing habits I mention in the thread that you linked to starting this talk :(</p>
<p>Well, I may be an eco-monster, although not because of this. I also don&rsquo;t have a car, and have been commuting with public transportation to and from work or school everyday since 2002 (with the exception of my year in Reading… here, I walk to school).</p>
<p>As for my four laptops and two iPods since 1999…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When my first laptop died I sold it to a repair shop (who wanted to take it apart) for $100. So I hope that many of the parts got reused and not thrown straight away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When so many parts of my second laptop died, I gave it to my mother, who had much of it repaired at her own costs, and now she uses it as a stationary machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My third laptop still hasn&rsquo;t died! It lives in Berlin, being periodically used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using my fourth laptop every day ;-)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As for my first iPod, well, that probably is in a landfill somewhere. My second iPod is safe and sound, right next to me.</p>
<p>From 1995–1999 I had a desktop Performa. This never got thrown away. It lives inside a closet still at my parents' house.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just ran into this thing&hellip; Cool.</p>
<p>1977: Commodore PET 2001-8
Purchased in Palo Alto for $800. Neighbors had no idea what it was. We weren&rsquo;t too sure either. Internal cassette drive (speed estimated at 50 bytes/second). Traded in to CBM dealer in Beirut for purchase of next item. Still kicking self for that.</p>
<p>1980: Commodore PET 4016
External cassette drive. Donated to my high school upon purchase of next item. They never touched it. So my brother and I basically broke into their storage room one evening and did an extraction. Still in my parents' basement in Beirut.</p>
<p>1982: Commodore 64
What an amazing machine that was. Next to the PET in the basement. Has the external floppy drive (which cost more than the computer), and I was in awe of its blazing speed and massive 170Kb capacity.</p>
<p>1987: Amiga 500
1.5Mb Ram. No hard disk. Ran Fontographer 3.1 under Mac emulation (used a virtual RAM-Drive partition to fake a hard disk). Added a weird daughterboard to support an over-clocked FPU (used to do ray-traced animation). Donated to a very small Armenian TV show in LA for videotitling upon purchase of next item.</p>
<p>1992: Amiga 3000
Hard disk! Killer machine. Still in garage.</p>
<p>199?: Commodore Plus-4
Purchased at garage sale. Sold at garage sale.</p>
<p>1995: Self-built PC box (386)
Used for testing fonts. Still in garage.</p>
<p>1996: Apple IIcx
Picked up on the way to being dumped. Used for testing fonts. Trashed upon acquisition of next item.</p>
<p>1998: Apple Quadra
Picked up on the way to being dumped. Used for testing fonts. Trashed.</p>
<p>2000: Dell laptop - Latitude 14&quot;
Purchased used. The first non-Commodore I ever liked. My gray warrior. Sold via eBay upon purchase of next item.</p>
<p>2003: Compaq laptop - 15&quot;
Crappy machine. CPU melted when fan got blocked. Data all OK!</p>
<p>2006: Dell laptop - Inspiron 17&quot;
Pretty ugly, but solid worker. Current main machine.</p>
<p>2009: HP 2140 mini (HD screen)
Great little machine. Not used enough.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>1984: Texas Instruments TI 99/4A. Really no more than a huge desktop calculator with a tape drive. What a piece of junk. Its built-in BASIC sucked. Scrapped.</p>
<p>1985: Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48+ (not the rubbery keyboard jobby, but a sleek black one with <em>proper</em> keys!). Fairly slow, until I learned to program in raw Z80 machine code. Bliss! Sold to a friend on next purchase.</p>
<p>1986: Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128. Built-in tape drive, more memory, nice advanced sound chip (a Yamaha, if I&rsquo;m correct). For the rest pretty same as above. Sold on next purchase.</p>
<p>1988: Brand new Atari ST 520. Yes, the Amiga was better graphically, but this was a lot cheaper. Learned 68000 assembler. Wrote an almost-complete Postscript emulator. Checked out Mac programs. Played games. Lent it to a friend (and never got it back) after next purchase.</p>
<p>1989/1990: (ish) Second hand Acorn Archimedes A3000. Double disk drive, but still no hard drive. Learned ARM assembler. Incredibly powerful machine &ndash; learned to program for PCs through its emulator. Still have it, but no monitor to hook it up to &hellip;</p>
<p>1991: Self-built 486 PC. Learned 8086 assembler and C. Bought a virtual reality helmet and learned to write programs for it. A new dimension to graphics! Traded in for next purchase.</p>
<p>..2009: Various PCs, all Frankenstein-wise containing salvaged parts from previous PCs. Ransacked items travelled down the family to dad, brothers, sisters, until (presumably) old beyond measure and scrapped. Learned C++ and wrote all kinds of programs for Windows, with various success.</p>
<p>2009: Dawn of a new age: while writing, I&rsquo;m still oogling this shiny new 21.5&quot; iMac. Learning XCode as we speak. Posting this because my head hurts of going <em>again</em> through a major programming paradigm change.</p>
<p>Price-wise I don&rsquo;t appear to have learned something; always shelling out near-top prices for machines that are advertised to be very nearly &ldquo;top of the bill&rdquo; for no more than 6 months.
Memory-wise I amuse my younger colleagues with stories of 48K, filled to the point of overflowing, where this machine has about 80,000 times that much.
Performance-wise: here I am, staring at a 1920 x 1080 32-bit color screen and trying to decide how this is <em>more</em> fun than 256x192, black-and-white &hellip;</p>

<p>2008: MacBook Pro 15&quot;</p>
<p>2009: MacBook Pro 17&quot; (unibody) My current main computer.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m kind of a Mac guy. I&rsquo;ve only listed computers that were my primary or, in a few cases, secondary computer. Unless noted as sold, I still have them, either in use somewhere in the house or gathering dust. I also picked up a few other computers that I don&rsquo;t actually use much, such as an original Compaq PC &ldquo;luggable&rdquo; (acquired in 1996), and a Sinclair ZX81 (2000). I have set up in my basement a Mac SE, an LC III and my old PowerMac G3 so I can boot up any pre-OS X Mac system if I need to access very old files or programs. Not that I&rsquo;ve found much need to do so, as it has turned out. I&rsquo;ve also left out computers my partner or daughter use (the odd iMac, iBook, or MacBook), not to mention a Newton MessagePad 110 (still works) and a Palm IIIx.</p>
<p>My first Mac cost $2500 in 1984. The most expensive was probably the 840av, at about $4700 in 1993. My most recent, the MacBook Pro 17&quot;, was $2800, nominally higher in price than my first Mac, but only about $1300 in 1984 dollars. Plus, it&rsquo;s about 325 times faster, has over 30,000 times a much memory, 12 times as much screen area (in full color), and weighs less than a third as much.</p>
<p>My all-time favorite so far is my current MacBook Pro. My least favorite was the HP Pavilion, which was incredibly cheap and underpowered, had a big blue light on the front that blinked on and off when it was asleep (I&rsquo;M ASLEEP!&hellip; I&rsquo;M ASLEEP!&hellip; I&rsquo;M ASLEEP!) and would wake randomly for no apparent reason.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>since nobody else has said &ldquo;osborne&rdquo; yet,
let me be the first.  i loved that machine&hellip;</p>
<p>worked on lots of p.c. machinery after that.</p>
<p>and for the last decade or more, macs only.
(a handful of them, and 2 iphones as well.)</p>
<p>my machines are always tight, and run well.
i don&rsquo;t tolerate any bloat, or random crashes.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve also found that memory, hard-drive size,
and monitor size are crucially important, even
to the point that the machine-type is dwarfed.</p>
<p>while doing statistical work in graduate school
for a professor who was consulting for xerox,
i came across the alto/bravo machines, with
a portrait monitor, and became fixated on it.</p>
<p>all i wanted was the ability to see a full page
of a document at a reasonable size, which is
certainly not an unreasonable request, is it?</p>
<p>i worked a shit job once, for far too long, just
because it let me work on a portrait monitor&hellip;</p>
<p>year after year after year, i waited, patiently,
but it seemed like the monitor manufacturers
were bound and determined to stall things out
with monitors that gave not-quite-a-full-page.</p>
<p>finally, about 5 years back, i got a 23-inch
cinema monitor, where i can now see <em>two</em>
pages of a document at a reasonable text-size.
it&rsquo;s really nice to finally get something that you
have wanted for two decades, let me tell you&hellip;</p>
<p>add to that a terabyte drive sitting on my desk,
and things are pretty good for me right now&hellip;</p>
<p>i could use some more memory in this macbook,
especially since today&rsquo;s browsers are bloatware
(and unavoidable, since the web is now required),
but other than that, i&rsquo;m not complaining too much.</p>
<p>looking back, there&rsquo;s only one machine that i wish
i would have bought &ndash; one of the amigas that were
video-capable way back in the old-days, years before
other machines caught up to &lsquo;em (if they actually have).
being skilled in video capture and manipulation just
might have pointed me in a slightly different direction.</p>
