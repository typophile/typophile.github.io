  body: Nah, it only looks nasty because you're looking at it with the wrong disposition.
    This is actually a great little face -- Ad Sans a.k.a. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=BT.122233.0.0">Humanist
    970</a>, a typeface specifically designed to be used at tiny point sizes in newspaper
    classifieds. This is why the shapes are very pronounced and a little awkward.
