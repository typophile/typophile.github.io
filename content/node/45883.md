  is my latest FontStruction (now that I have OS X at home, I am spending way too
  much time at FontStruct!).\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bonset_sample_4427.png]\r\n\r\nMy
  version deviates from van Doesburg's tight grid -- it's condensed, and I changed
  some of the glyphs. I also added a lowercase, and I'm slowly building up the diacritics,
  with the help of the <a href=\"http://www.typo.cz/euro/index.html\">Typo-cz</a>
  website for the Central European characters.\r\n\r\nSo far, it's been a lot of fun!"

  body: Thanks, Mark... And I can explain about using Keynote! I just got a new computer,
    and I barely have anything on my hard drive! I was planning to download trial
    versions of Adobe applications today, but because of a glitch in the code, their
    downloads are not available until July 1... By then I will have bought the CS3
    design suite, anyway. Meanwhile, er.... there's Keynote.  :-/

  body: I heard recently (I think on Mac Break Weekly podcast) of a designer who does
    everything in Keynote. I did a book in Illustrator once. Thirty-some pages on
    an giant grid. Dave Eggers (of McSweeny's fame) does all his writing in Quark
    4.

  body: "<em>I did a book in Illustrator once. Thirty-some pages on an giant grid.</em>\r\n\r\nMy
    hat is off to you, sir. That must have been quite a task! But it's much better
    to present a book created in Illustrator than in MS Word (I've heard horror stories
    from printers in that regard). I understand Chip Kidd writes in QuarkXPress, too,
    but that's less surprising, coming from a graphic designer. (And heck, even QuarkXPress
    3 worked well as a word processor.)\r\n\r\nBut, yeah, it'll be nice to finally
    try FontTool and FontLab at home, now that I have the right OS..."

  body: The book I did in Illustrator (3.0, I think) was very graphics-heavy. Part
    of it was a timeline that spread over many pages. The book's pages were set up
    as tiles. It was actually kind of nice to see it all at once, from a bird's-eye
    view, and then zoom in to a particular spot to work. It was also nice to be able
    to work directly and in-context with the graphics on each page (the main reason
    it was done this way). Overall, it felt like a very organic way to work, but I
    don't think it would be practical for most books. Bleeds would be a problem, for
    instance.
