  the Calgary 1988 Winter Olympics logo. It appears to be very similar to Helvetica
  Condensed Black but the \"C\" seems more oval to me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    isn\u2019t that particular about logos, especially typefaces used in logos.\r\n\r\nSee
    also the \u201CApollo I\u201D patch using some typeface that looks suspiciously

  body: "The current Wikipedia version of the logo was made by me, yesterday, overlaid
    to an original image that is the exact same displayed in the IOC website. I just
    decided to use Helvetica Condensed Black for now and gave a more rounded look
    to the \"C\". In the meantime, if you guys can identify the original font, I can
    update the current image.\r\n\r\nLex: Univers? The lower-case \"y\" does not have
    a curved tail in that font type."

    the \"a\" is not Univers, am I wrong?"
