    Not because I take Typophile too seriously, but  <BR>because there&#39;s nothing
    funny about pedophilia.

    a human thing, and I never had any problems  <BR>with it as long as they don&#39;t
    cross that nigh-impossible  <BR>to define line. Unfortunately that line is situated
    somewhere  <BR>else for every single person.

  body: True, Yves. Had I not known the &#39;title&#39; of this one I would&#39;ve  <BR>thought
    it was innocent, a little cute and somewhat  <BR>strange. But knowing the title
    of it just made me a little  <BR>queasy. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a dad
    and find things like <BR>this getting less funny as I get older.

    be honest though, before I saw the title of the shirt I thought it was a man inspecting
    the little &#34;t&#34; with a magnifying glass. I don&#39;t think I would have
    guessed a lollipop. Maybe at larger sizes I could tell. <BR> <BR>Mitchell

  body: I was totally confused by this thread until I went back and saw the title,
    which I had missed. So now I get the whole typo/pedo attempt at malapropian humor.  <BR>
    <BR>There actually is something funny about the this shirt - not about pedophilia,
    Joe, but about ignorance. As in, &#34;What the hell is a typophile? Isn&#39;t
    that someone who likes little kids?&#34; The fact that the suffix phile &#40;or
    the sound &#34;ophile&#34;&#41; most immediately elicits a correlation with the
    most depraved philia is more an indictment of our literacy as a culture than  an
    endoresment of NAMBLA. I think we all know many more people who enjoy a good book,
    their iPod, and a decent Merlot than the company of a young child, but how often
    are the terms biblio-, audio-, or enophile uttered in mainstream media &#40;or
    in conversation&#41;? <BR> <BR>On a seperate note involving humour involving lowercase
    letters, did anyone see the Saturday Night Live Weekend Update bit on Verne Troyer&#39;s
    &#40;Mini Me in Austin Powers&#41; drinking problem? They said he had checked
    into a lowercase &#34;a.a.&#34; group. Now THAT&#39;S funny. <BR> <BR> <BR>CCHS
    <BR> <BR> <BR>P.S. There is nothing funny about Alcoholism. <BR>P.P.S. There is
    nothing funny about little people either.

  body: P.P.P.S &#40;and quite seriously&#41; I was in no way implying that you are
    ignorant, Joe. I refer instead to the collective &#34;we&#34; of American society.
    I leave it to oversea Typophiles to condemn of commend their own cultural experiences.  <BR>
    <BR>I hope my post was not misconstrued.

    the first thing you think of when you <BR>hear another word that ends with &#34;phile&#34;?
    Sheesh, you really need to change who you listen to. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Not saying I do, just suggesting that it may be why others do &#40;or perhaps
    why the author of that design was inspired to attempt such a play on words&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I also inferred from Joe&#39;s comment, &#34;Another pedophile reference?
    Ick. I&#39;ve never found this stuff funny...&#34; that this is a common association.
