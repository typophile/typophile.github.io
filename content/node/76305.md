  body: "I don't really want to try hard to defend the idea that the Latin script
    is inherently superior to the Arabic script.\r\n\r\nIt may <em>seem</em> that
    way to those of us who are used to the Latin script. That's because it is hard
    for us to learn, as the shapes of the different letters don't appear to us to
    be very distinct, at least in the initial and medial forms.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    though, a change in script means that people have to learn to read over again,
    at least in part, and it would seem that any small gains from a change would be
    negated by the massive cost of the changeover.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, though, Indonesia,
    of course, has many non-Muslim citizens, such as on Bali, for whom the Arabic
    script has no special cultural significance. Are they expected to be conversant
    with the Malay language?"

    forms.\r\n\r\n1. Basically, Arabic has only 17 letter forms + dots.\r\nMedial
    forms = initial forms + short tails to the their right.\r\nFinal Forms = initial
    or  Medial forms + longer tails to their left.\r\n-\r\nOut of any Latin font,
    you can easily make ALL the Arabic letterforms as follows:\r\npick @ (as is) for
    ha,\r\npick i\xEF\xEE (as is) for N + t + Th respectively and v-flip them for
    B + Y + P,\r\npick o (as is) for Meem and centre one dot above for F,\r\npick
    \xF6 (as is) for Qaf.\r\npick q (as is) for waw. \r\npick S for Kaf.\r\npick j
    (as is) for Z and remove the dot for R.\r\npick c (as is) for Ain and center one
    dot above for Gheen.\r\npick c + h-flip it for Dal and center one dot above for
    Zal.\r\npick b (as is) for T and center one dot above the round part for Zah.\r\npick
    V + rotate it 75 CCW for H and center 1 dot above for Kh. Or 1 dot below for geem.\r\npick
    D + rotate it 90 CCW for Sad and center one dot above for Zad.\r\npick E + rotate
    it 90 CCW for Seen and center 3 dots above for Sheen.\r\n-\r\n2. Man reads words
    not letterforms?!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Microsoft does not claim there are 22 Arabic scripts. However, countries
    that share the same script may have different options for representing the date
    and time; the internationalization settings in Windows control other things beside
    the script used.\r\n\r\nIt is true that practiced readers read single words by
    eye, but to get started, one needs to read the individual letters and sound out
    the word. Otherwise, alphabetic scripts would have no advantage over the Chinese
    writing system."

    the Chinese writing system.\r\n\r\nCan I say, applying the same logic of what
    you said earlier: if Chinese was changed over to a form of the Latin script, that
    would have partly facilitated the improvement in that country's literacy levels?!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think that, yes, the use of an alphabetic script would reduce the amount
    of time children would need to spend on learning to read and write in school,
    both in China and in Japan. This would decrease the economic cost of achieving
    a high level of literacy. That doesn't mean, of course, that a high level of literacy
    can't be achieved without that particular reform, as experience has shown.

    only, does not diminish religious liberty, and the equality of people of all faiths,
    but it does encourage them to learn one another script as witnessed in Malaysia
    + Iran.\r\n\r\nBut a cunning + hidden political movement fool people away from
    their roots and did + does not allow them to choose even names as happened in
    Turkey + happening in Thailand + Indonesia. Worse, in some places, road signs
    with Arabic script are removed with the removal of historical villages + towns
    from the map?!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't want to get into a discussion of politics here, because of course
    this is not the place for that. I had understood, though, that in Indonesia, people
    of Chinese ethnic origin were prevented from using Chinese names for quite some
    time. And, indeed, that did have nothing to do with Islam, but was due to the
    nationalism of the former regime there.\r\n\r\nAs for Shari'a, perhaps I do misunderstand
    what it is about. It is commonly believed in the West that this legal system puts
    non-Muslims at a disadvantage, and fails to provide women of all faiths with adequate
    recourse if they become victims of sexual assault. Is this belief truly in error?"
