  Metrics window:\r\n\r\nAnybody know if there's a way to increase the leading between
  multiple lines of type displayed in the Metrics window? I can't find a preference.
  This applies to the window display and the printed Font Samples.\r\n\r\nI'm finding
  it more difficult than it could be to reasonably judge colour in a paragraph or
  with multiple lines because they're set solid. This also means the kerning marks
  beneath pairs often clash with ascenders in the line below -- another hindrance
  to determining the look/colour/balance of a whole paragraph."

  body: I don't know if that is possible, however, I usually just generate a fontfile
    and set a paragraph in InDesign for print outs.

  body: Although this is not a good idea but you can temporarily Pull your descender
    line down, this will increase the leading between lines in the Metrix window too.

  body: You can export a fontfile in the font directory of the indesign program files.
    If you save a new document over this old one, it will automatically be updated
    in Indesign.

  body: "Ok, I thought as much. Thanks all.\r\n\r\nI didn't know of the local InDesign
    fonts directory, but that's definitely a good tip. A bit more laborious than instant
    tests in the Metrics window though. Perhaps leading should be a feature request."
