    resolution, there may not be a superior image available, and certainly not a vector
    file. I run into that a lot. So then I have to charge the client to recreate the
    logo from start in order to have a usable file. Why? Because plotters and cnc

    thought for web... the halos are made with little stitches, that such as the lettering,
    reflect the light and seem to be little pearls. The question is: do you want it
    to look like simple vectores, or do you want it to keep looking like embroidery...\r\n\r\n\"is
    there life after pixels?\" :) hehehe thanks, you made me laugh!!"

  body: 'artslons: the He, Cr, and ns, are connected in the original (if i''m right,
    considering the original as an embroidery, it becomes easier and cheaper when
    all the letters are connected). The 7 is too chunkie and the curves don''t seem
    ok... neither does the halo, you should try to find a more elegant way of drawing
    the halo.'

    And for what it is worth, (I mean we are talking about Brush Script here) you've
    got some kerning issues in the word \"creation.\"\r\n\r\nCan't you do a complete
    brand refresh, maybe find a new script and overall new treatment for this mark?
    I'd talk your client into it, if I were you - scrap the whole thing and start
    from scratch."

    software. I'm pretty sure because that's what I do for a living.\r\nAbout the
    halo, it looks that way because of the stitch type. I woudn't try to emulate it
    on vector format."
