  body: The double R is not working like this, I read it RRhoads and the red R is
    kicking &#34;Design &amp; Construction&#34;. You also have RH and AD letters stick
    to each other.

  body: Ah! you could have some fun with beams and braces to support your R. <BR>
    <BR>The fact being that your unfinished R is a work in progress, and under construction.
    And if gravity were involved, it would fall on its butt. <BR> <BR>In short, do
    what doozers do.

  body: Crossing serifs are always a big no-no? I generally not a big serif fan. <BR>
    <BR>The kick was my struggle to do something w/ nothing. I tried talking to him
    about naming his company w/ imagery that may make it memorable, but he really
    likes his name. It currently feels static, old and boring.  <BR> <BR>He likes
    the fonts, but to me it looks like I could have designed this thing in Word. <BR>
    <BR>I have tried a few shapes to integrate w/ the R and have come up short. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m going to try to do what he dooz. This needs a little life kicked in
    it.

  body: I agree that the R needs to be anchored, somehow, visually. The weight of
    &#34;Design &amp; Construction&#34; seems heavy. Call me boring, but I often consider
    the thinnest and thickest portions to find a middle ground. I wonder if that line
    should match the thinnest &#40;or close to&#41; part of the serif face?

  body: The R seems too heavy, in particular, the leg of the R. <BR> <BR>A possibility
    would be a superscripted H and the leg of the R could cradle it? Just random thought.

  body: listening to the fraggle wisdom, I came with these. I havent thinned up the
    &#34;R&#34; yet &#40;when its separate it really shows&#41;. I agree w/ Tiffany
    about the thickness of Design &amp; Construction, but I&#39;ve been over-ruled
    by the client on multiple occasions. I&#39;ll probably try sneaking in a medium
    version. I mainly like the top one, but I included a few along the way. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    feeling healthier now, not so detached. I really appreciate the ideas. <BR><img

  body: 'yeah, 4,5,6 are dead. Today I&#39;ll put up a couple new adjustments. White
    looked ok, but I liked the red better, althought same color does look pretty good
    in a low contrast situation. &#40;I&#39;ll put that up too.&#41; Currently I am
    leaning slightly to red roof &#40;less vs overt&#41;, but im going to simplify
    the ornementation on #2 to see if that changes my mind.  <BR> <BR>Any kerners
    out there have an opinion on the HO? It seems to want to breathe, but any more
    space and the roofline doesnt drop into the O as smoothly'

  body: I&#39;ll try to put one of those up as well Jonathan, but I think the Larger
    &#34;R&#34; catches the roof nicely, and sets up the left triangle line off the
    top of the &#34;R&#34;.

  body: The red roof is just not integrated yet. Its more of a hat for the H, weighing
    it down. And the spacing between roof and H is bothersome, especially on white.  <BR>

  body: Plain text and ampersand ended up as the final. No roof, no hat, no gate.
    Thanks for all the help and ideas. Sometimes designs are just plain stubborn and
    never quite make it, but you guys helped me make the most of what I had.

  body: Bottom right is the best so far but why do you need the double red &amp; and
    symbol of H. I personally feel like the logos are caught between being elegant
    and communicative. It&#39;s not there though, the best one though I think is the
    third one up on the right it&#39;s a little overdone but the hierarchy is better
    than the others. Gluck.
