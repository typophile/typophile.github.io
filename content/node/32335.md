body: "I'm curious what the typophiles think of the idea to have a design contest
  for a new logo to represent the city of Anchorage, AK.  The logo they paid thousands
  for (I think 200k!) is a <a href=\"http://www.bigwildlife.com/\"> big brown splat,</a>
  and people just HATE it. I can't tell if the pixelation is intentional or not?\r\n\r\nRestrictions?
  \ Must be a resident of Anchorage to submit work. \r\nThe prize?  \"An unspecified
  package of Alaskan items worth $3000.\"\r\n\r\nIMHO, and in the name of good design,
  we should pepper the forum with our take on such contests ...  http://community.adn.com/?q=adn/node/100260\r\n\r\nAK\r\n"

  body: Given how well hiring qualified and expensive designers worked out, I really
    don't think that giving them flak about running a contest is appropriate. If I
    spent $200,000 and got a logo that looked like a random ornament clipped out of
    a threadless shirt I wouldn't hire another professional designer either.

    this contest insulting. \r\n\r\nI strongly resent the notion that designing a
    logo is anything less than a professional endeavor, requiring education, skill,
    experience, and the ability to cultivate productive client/designer communications.

    holds contest to .... Repair schoolbuses! Plow city streets!  Manage the statewide
    DMV!  Provide health insurance to city workers!  Invest the Permanent Fund (ok,
    I know that's obscure to the lower 48, but it's important to Alaskans. Ask google.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I take myself too seriously, but I've spent a lifetime learning and loving this

  body: "RE the reaction\r\n\r\nReading the ADN blog the feeling I get is that Anchoragites
    just don't like the idea of being 'brandable'. I am somewhat sympathetic to that
    but I doubt they mean it. They don't complain about the branding of their sports
    teams... Keep in mind these are folks who were 'too Texas as for Texas' for the
    most part. I think what they really feel is that the design doesn't refelect their
    taste. And about that they are right. If the logo had flames on it they would
    be far happier. Or sharp teeth. Or faux chrome. Or all three. So instead of admiting
    that their macho self image is under threat by the campaign - they resort to arguements
    they don't mean, certainly don't understand and at maximum volume. \r\n\r\nRE:
    the cash\r\n\r\nIf somebody was paid that much to build a house nobody would blink.
    I don't think 200k is too much for the job they were given to do. Double that
    would be fine too - I say 'look reality in the face & LICK IT'*. \r\n\r\nRE: success
    or failure\r\n\r\nThe campaign's success can't be judged by residents alone -
    they are not the folks the message is geared towards. But, and it's a big but,
    no camapaign can really be sustained without the support of common folk. Nerland's
    hubris in this regard is their undoing here. I like the site they built even if
    it comes directly out of the 'seattle style design' handbook. \r\n\r\nRE: The
    'shape'\r\n\r\nI think the mashup of shapes we call the splat is being focused
    on simply because it looks 'odd'. In the designer's mind they were thinking 'brown
    is very in just now'. In the local person's mind brown is the color of breakup
    when the snow melts & everything is infinitely muddy for a month. Our least favorite
    time of year. Seattlities wouldn't so much as blink at it. It's a flexible theme
    element like a light motif - only more flexible & more 'wild' - at least in the
    sense that it looks unkempt ;-) . It's actually a clever idea in some ways; but
    just not made as well as it might be; and unfortunately ready-made to freak out
    people whose graphic sensibility is just entering the early 90's. \r\n\r\n<cite>
    Designers aren\u2019t paid for the file on a disk. They\u2019re paid for the entire
    process of getting to the point of a file on a disk. </cite>\r\n\r\nToo right.
    Exactly. But they are also hired to get a business result. That's the measure
    the City aught to & almost certainly does care about. That business result can
    be affected by local attitude though. We have been losing fising spots to the
    folks this stuff is geared to for years. So local folks are feeling somehow sensitive.
    Well actually it's been to those Texans who live here now but we are too polite
    or brainwashed to admit that. Still, for folks who are really serious about the
    fishing thing - a successful campaign is the last thing they would hope for. And
    a dismal one is fodder for jokes.\r\n\r\nRE: the contest\r\n\r\nI think it's a
    faux populist PR move meant to help the whole thing blow over. And if nobody will
    does anything wothwhile they have a ready made excuse. And if they do something
    great they are of the hook then too. Ceratinly an 'adventure' 'valued at 3k' is
    too cheap to lure me in.\r\n\r\nIn any event I think none of this is actually
    so serious. Except for the Nerland folks perhaps. I say why not treat it like
    sports. It's only 200k, & there is always next year. \r\n\r\n* One of my favorite
    lines from 'The Mighty Boosh' a british comedy that references Alaska with surprising
    regularity. "
