  body: "The term used to describe this style of lettering is multiline or triline.
    This includes variations where the ends are closed and those where they are open.
    It would also include this variation in which a non connecting continuous stroke
    loops back and forth from outside to inside. If the corners of the looping stroke
    were rounded rather than square, the term neon -- derived from the characteristics
    of illuminated glass tube signs made by warping the glass into a looping strokes
    -- could also be applied.\r\ncompare to the neon font Eclectic Crumpany NF \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EclecticCrumpanyNFAsLUC_6369.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/eclectic-crumpany-nf/\r\n\r\nI'm
    not certain if this multiline lettering is an actual font. If it is, the most
    likely place to find it is Creative Market https://creativemarket.com/fonts \r\nSearches
    using multiline, triline, neon, experimental, lines and stripes produced some
    interesting somewhat similar designs but not this one. LUC might be in a font
    without any of these tags.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
