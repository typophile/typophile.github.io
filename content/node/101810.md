    the font spec for color bitmaps? And how could it be made to work on Windows?
    Without being sued?\r\n\r\nPerformance: Back in the mid-90s I made the prototype
    of Mana-16, a bunch of tiny GIFs of grayscale letterforms coupled to a script
    that took a raw text file and generated an HTML file of hundreds of image declarations,
    thus rendering running text using grayscale bitmaps... The main performance problem
    was the size of the resultant HTML file! So an actual font was -and I suspect
    still must be- the only way to make this sing.\r\n\r\nBut this is all probably
    pointless anyway. Text size is too variable these days. Hmmm, unless a hand-made
    grayscale (or even better, subpixel) bitmap font can be rendered by collaging
    small hand-made elements that can be slid around, scaled, layered, to produce
    a range of sizes from a single master set... Man, I really have to stop thinking
    like a hacker.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: There's always a bit of lag while the bitmaps are fetched, but it shortens
    a lot once they're in the cache. If you have ever edited a post on a phpBB-based
    board, you'll know already. The editor has a bitmap (GIF or PNG) emoji insert
    feature, y'see.
