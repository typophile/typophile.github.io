    printer, how could paper type take more ink? I'm not too familiar on the mechanics. "

  body: "James, I think he means that Century Gothic sets wider than Arial, and, therefore,
    would use more paper. \r\n\r\nI checked this out before talking to an NPR reporter
    about it last week. The difference is not as great as I would have thought. In
    many cases, I don't think it will make a difference in the number of pages printed,
    but occasionally, especially with longer emails or emails that nearly fill the
    last page, it might add a page. It would have to be a very long email to add more
    than one page.\r\n\r\nStill, I would be curious to know how much of the savings
    in ink will be lost in increased paper usage."

  body: "Mark, they seem to be recommending increasing the type size. Their \"how
    to\" indicates switching to 12 and 11. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.uwgb.edu/compserv/ehelp/office2007/fontchanges.htm\r\n\r\nThis
    sets quite a bit longer than 10pt Arial or the more recent 11pt Calibri defaults.
    \r\n\r\nIncidentally Printer.com compares ink usage of 11pt Arial against 10pt
    Century Gothic. \r\n\r\nhttp://blog.printer.com/2009/04/printing-costs-does-font-choice-make-a-difference/

    thing, (besides that Mark did not give up the secret of optical scaling nor did
    Mr. Fink leap forward to accuse NPR of being part of the Founding Fathers Conspiracy),
    is that All the Type In the Document must be 10 point Century Gothic! Clear! You
    start printing even a few pages of \"GO PACK GO!\" in Impact all caps 456 point,
    and You Are On Double Secret Probation. \r\n\r\nAnd the other other thing is,
    why don't they just make the windows users buy and carry around their own cartridges!?
    ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
