  pounding tribal rhythms of Afrobeat music is expressed through this psychedelic
  brand new font, Afrobeat. Every letter becomes art as every letter is elegantly
  placed side by side, like music notes, creating music for the eyes. \r\n\r\nAfrobeat
  is a musical style performed by many African artists such as Fela Kuti, Femi Kuti,
  Antibalas and many more, which is a fusion of jazz,funk, and psychedelic rock, originating
  from the 60s and was based on the political movements of Nigeria.\r\n\r\nThe Font\r\n\r\nThis
  font is perfect for when you want to use eye-catching big texts for anything from
  posters and flyers for concerts, events, parties, to CD covers, advertisements,
  and art, but it\xB4s especially striking for printed projects."
