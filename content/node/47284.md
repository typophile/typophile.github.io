    Spencer of the 19th century. Unfortunately, most type searches will lump copperplate
    scripts in with Spencerian because they are all formal pointed pen scripts.\r\n\r\nA
    excellent example of a Spencerian style font is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-zaner/\r\n\r\nor
    the thinner more casual:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-allyson/\r\n\r\nBoth
    are from Paul Hunt.\r\n"
