  plans of trying to extract it or anything. Please?\r\nI'd even be happy just with
  a converted-to-outlines charset.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Why not print <a href="http://kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html">Kent's beautiful
    PDF</a>? Also, for another printed view, Whitney is featured in <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=304">FontBooklet
    No.1</a>. Order one up if you haven't already.

  body: "Stephen -- You read too quickly. Hrant's looking for Frere-Jones's <em>Whitney</em>,
    not Whitman. \r\n\r\nHrant -- If you go to the Whitney page at H&FJ's website
    and click on the Language Support link on the right, you'll see a graphic of the
    alphabetic set. Probably not anywhere near the detail you're looking for.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Simon, you know too much. Prepare to die.\r\n\r\nJames, I'm glad to hear
    that damn Hostway address even signals there's a problem. I tried to reach you
    via LinkedIn, but I guess you don't have that redirecting right. Please use hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com,
    and thanks profusely for the help.\r\n\r\nRestricting embedding: no matter how
    negatively I feel about that in general, there's no force majeur here that would
    excuse ignoring that clause in the H&FJ EULA*, which is why I mentioned convert-to-outlines
    as an option. Now, restricting the embedding of glyphs converted to outlines?
    Don't give me an emigraine.\r\n\r\n* Very nice to hear about distinctions between
    embedding intents BTW.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
