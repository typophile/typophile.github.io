body: "No, seriously. Microsoft Word version 11.3.5 under OS X (Leopard) 10.5.1, is
  displaying and printing common ligatures (fi, fl, ffl, etc) for OpenType -- not
  AAT -- fonts. Not entirely consistently, but like 90% of the time. But it's not
  spacing for them. So you get the ligature and then a large gap before the next letter.\r\n\r\nI
  can post screenshots if you don't believe me, but try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone (a) have any idea what's going on; or (b) know who I should be filing a bug
  report with?"

  body: "I have some similar problem with Textmate (texteditor), I use my own monospace
    font (OT font with ligature feature: fi, fl, ff) and the systems text engine substitutes
    the glyphs but the Program is not aware of the change in glyph count and places
    the cursor at the wrong position. This behavior started with 10.5\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Yes, MS Word uses ATSUI but they cache metrics and alter the glyph advances
    via the ATSUI low level callbacks.  I believe there's a MS bug already but I'll
    search the DB.  Looks like TextMate has the same issues.  Bottom line is, I don't
    think this is a problem with the OT layout engine in Leopard but I'll double check
    nevertheless.\r\n\r\nDan"
