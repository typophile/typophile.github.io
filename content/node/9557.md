  see If it were possiable to make a true 1x1 typeface readable. here is what i came
  up with. <BR>ROYGBIV is the order of colors of the rainbow if anyone dosn&#39;t
  know. <BR> <BR><a href="http://mevsthem.com/public/true1x1typeface/index.php?image=f2ccace5c6e0de94244b28743bdd89ca"

  body: Full color version is still in the works. <BR>Also numbers would be spelled
    there is only 26 characters and each character is lower and upper case letter.
    everything else is spelled.

  body: i&#39;m all for experimentation, and am entirely willing to crash and burn
    if it means i stand the chance of a&#41; succeeding or b&#41; learning. <BR> <BR>so,
    i applaud your willingness to share your concept. <BR> <BR>however, this one is
    a bit beyond my reach. <BR> <BR>in short, i&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re just
    having a little fun with the folks here at the forum, or if you&#39;re really
    wanting feedback that will guide you to some goal-driven end. <BR> <BR>how are
    individual pixels of color going to take on the role of recognizable letterforms
    without a translator? <BR> <BR>i can&#39;t read rainbows, but i appreciate their
    beauty.

  body: I wanted to make a 1 pixel typeface that was in some way readable.Iv always
    liked the font in Windows called small font[s]it had the letters at 2 pixels at
    starting point and iv always wondered if it was possiable to make a 1 pixel typeface
    readable. How does a person know the alphabet unless they learn it, its same thing,
    you have to learn everything. If you go to another country how do you know what
    letter is which and what it means. Why stop at shapes when you can communicate
    using color.

  body: good point about learning how to read other languages. <BR> <BR>but how are
    you going to come up with 26 different colors that will be distinguishable enough
    from one another to function as letters in an alphabet unless you treat the colors
    like phone keys? <BR> <BR>take 1800-collect, for example. each key on the phone
    can be three or even four different characters... <BR> <BR>it&#39;ll be interesting
    to see where you take this.

  body: I have started making the full version and its possiable to have a 26 character
    set, but not all fonts have a working 26&#43; character set take 3x3 pixel font
    for example or even 2x2 the 2x2 lower case b looks great 2 pixels on the left
    side one pixel on the bottom right and you have a nice bold lower case b blow
    that up in vector and it looks nice! iv always been a fan of small fonts some
    of them don&#39;t fully work but they have nice characters that can be used, look
    at the LFO album cover using 3x3 pixel font that F is NICE!. The 26 1px color
    character set is possiable Cc could be Cyan Ll lime green and so on, i havn&#39;t
    decided on the final colors for the full 26 character set, ROYGBIV is usable and
    so it RGB as long as it has the characters u need. Know what i mean? <BR> <BR>
    <BR>DOH! i just realized i spelled my nickname wrong hehe oh well.
