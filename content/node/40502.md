  body: "These letters were made specifically for architectural application and didn't
    exist as fonts. There were various forms of metal architectural letters throughout
    the 40s-60s. I'm building a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157603592705592/\">collection
    of images</a> and I'd love to add yours to my set if you don't mind. I do live
    in Berkeley, so I could shoot it myself, but yours is a fine image.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "i actually took the image from a flickr page. it is not one of mine.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for all of the info. it really is puzzling to me that such standarization can
    be found nationwide and yet a typeface does not appear to exist. i guess i shouldn't
    be surprised though...i went to architecture school and you spend your first few
    semesters learning how to hand letter drawings in a very specific way.\r\n\r\n"
