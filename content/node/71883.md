  it perfectly.  it looks really close, but then you zoom in and look at the corner,
  and the shape is a few pixels off.  never seen a computer with cs4 or cs3 that didn't
  have this issue.\r\n\r\nis there any way to fix this?"

  body: 'I''m not quite sure why "a few pixels off" would be a problem, but using
    the center box in the "Transform" dialog can supposedly fix the problem. Or maybe
    not: it might have to do with Illustrator''s default measurements in points...'
