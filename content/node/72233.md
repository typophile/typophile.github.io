  script face.  It draws some inspiration from heavy brush drawn vintage hand lettering
  but its heavy weight is much thicker with plenty of impact and more contemporary
  letterforms. The face offers a wide array of weights, from the powerful Heavy weight
  to the graceful Thin.\r\n\r\nCaridade can get the job done for many unique design
  tasks.  \r\nCaridade includes many useful OpenType features, including a set of
  non-connecting alternates, 40 ligatures, and two types of end letterforms. OpenType
  features include ornaments, swash endings, ending contextual alternates, discretionary
  ligatures, ligatures and three different stylistic sets filled with alternates.
  In total, there are over 60 alternate letterforms.  Please see the sample .pdf to
  see these features in action.\r\n\r\nOpenType capable applications such as Quark
  or the Adobe suite can take full advantage of the automatically replacing ligatures
  and alternates.  This family also includes the glyphs to support a wide range of
  languages.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caridade-Poster-Main_4984.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caridade-Poster-OTF_5907.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caridade-Poster-Quote_5758.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caridade-Poster-Text_3449.png]"
