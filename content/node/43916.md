  can easily make your own shirt, but I haven't bought shirts from all of them, so
  I don't know how they come out. I saw [[http://www.typophile.com/node/32867|this
  post]], but I couldn't find a \"Which place is best\" type of post. Does anyone
  have recommendations about where to get T-shirts made?\r\n\r\nI'll probably need
  a few dozen of them, but they wouldn't all be exactly the same.\r\n\r\nMost important
  to me is that the material be of high quality.\r\n\r\nI'll find a T-shirt forum
  and post there if I don't get answers to this quesion here.\r\n\r\nI was originally
  thinking I'd get them from a website, but it could also be a place that doesn't
  sell things over the internet if it's near New York City."

    and a good bloke he is too. You might have heard of them as they do lots of competitions
    and things with the [[http://drawn.ca/|Drawn!]] blog.\r\n\r\nThe Bountee shirts
    are print-on-demand and as an early pre-launch guinnea pig, I can vouch for the
    quality. If the system is still the same as it was to begin with you get to set
    the price of the shirts, so if you just need a run for yourself you can set the
    price at cost.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.bountee.com/|bountee.com]]\r\n\r\n*Edit. Looks
    like Bountee is down for maintenance. Well worth checking back though ..."
