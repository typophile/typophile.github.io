body: I just found a new browser today for osX called Firefox, from Mozilla. It&#39;s
  the fastest browser I&#39;ve ever used. Plus, font size can easily change with a
  command-minus or command-plus. It&#39;s still in a preview stage but works great.
  Thought I&#39;d share! <BR> <BR>- Brian - <BR> <BR>

    However, even at 0.8 it&#39;s better than IE. I mean, how can anyone stand to
    browse the web without a tabbing browser??? <BR> <BR>Like David, we suffer IE
    when it&#39;s necessary. IE isn&#39;t the worst, per se. But it ain&#39;t the
    best. However, we&#39;ll see what happens in a few years, since MS is no longer
    developing IE for the Mac.

    it sounds like you use the tabbing thing just in normal browsing. At the risk

    than in windows? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: I think the tabs are more convenient than separate windows, since they don&#39;t
    clutter your taskbar/dock -- they&#39;re all together in the browser where they
    belong. Of course you can still open multiple Firefox windows if you want to.
    <BR> <BR>When I want to follow a link without losing my place on the current page,
    I find it very convenient to open the link in a new tab. Just middle-click the
    link &#40;assuming your mouse has three buttons or clickable scroll wheel&#41;.
    Whenever I&#39;m forced to use IE, I find myself middle-clicking links out of
    habit. You can also configure new tabs to load in the background, so you can open
    pages for later browsing without interruption. There&#39;s a Tabbrowser extension
    that adds tons of other options.  <BR> <BR>I remember hearing of an IE plugin
    that adds tabbed browsing, but I&#39;m not sure how it compares.

  body: 'Steve, I like tabbed browsing because I can group my browsing in a subject-oriented
    manner, rather than in an unsorted mess. <BR> <BR>If someone on typophile links
    something, I can open it in a tab attached to the originating window, then Cmnd&#43;Tab
    over to my email window which might have a tab for Hotmail and/or Gmail along
    with tabs for any links I got in emails. It&#39;s nice for research too, since
    I can run 4 Google searches in 4 windows and open links related to each in tabs
    under that originating Google search. I find IE to be laborious in contrast. <BR>
    <BR>This hits on a fundamental difference in the 2 big OSes &#40;mac and windows&#41;
    as well: logical/hierarchical segmentation. While tabbed browsing is possible
    in both OSes, in Windows every <i>document</i> gets its own Taskbar item &#40;except
    in apps like Photoshop&#41;, but in Mac OS every <i>app</i> gets its own Dock
    item, then you can move between documents in the app you choose. There are benefits
    to both, but I prefer the Mac method of hierarchical segmentation &#40;this isn&#39;t
    an official term, I&#39;m just using it for convenience&#41;. Also, OS X allows
    document windows from different apps to intermingle, so you can pull your Illustrator
    work to Photoshop without having to move every window out of the way, so it&#39;s
    not too strict about the segmenting &#40;OS 9 does not have this ability&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a PC-hater, and I don&#39;t use every single widget and feature
    of my browsers, but even for me IE is behind the curve in a few siginificant ways.
    And, if I understand correctly, MS is ditching IE anyway &#40;probably so they
    can just integrate browsing directly into the OS&#41;.'

    against a lot of these open-source browsers. Safari&#39;s <i>pretty</i> good about
    all that, and will be improving dramatically this fall, from what I hear. Except
    for a brief spate of IE-only browsing in college, I&#39;ve <i>always</i> used
    multiple browsers. So, I guess it&#39;s just something I&#39;m used to. <BR> <BR>I
    certainly have a preference when it comes to OS/hardware, but I use both. I&#39;d
    probably be Mac-only &#40;at home/home office&#41; if it weren&#39;t for gaming
    and the fact that sometimes things get sent to me in PC-only formats. Also, Macs
    are more typesetting-friendly, which goes a long way for me. However, I wouldn&#39;t
    be surprised if Longhorn puts an end to a lot of differences in that arena.

    <BR> <BR>What does the market share of a browser on desktop PCs in the office
    have to do with the market share of a targetted demographic of humans?  <BR> <BR>ALL
    browser stats like this are--for the most part--not relevant to USER prefs. Of
    course IE leads. It always will. As long as corporations by cheap PCs with Windows
    on them, there will be a large portion of people that HAVE to use IE from 9-5
    &#40;whether they actually prefer that browser or not&#41;. <BR> <BR>The incorrect
    assumption is that 95% of web users use IE 100% of the time as their preferred
    browser. <BR> <BR>&#34;Used in the sense or portability between browsers, accessibility
    does require significantly more effort to implement in many websites. &#34; <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m sorry, Steve, but that is just wrong. You design to standards, fix
    a few layout bugs in IE, and you&#39;re up and running. Accessibility is accessibility.
    When designing with accessibility in mind &#40;a core part of good web design
    IMHO&#41; then the browser issue is resolved along the way. <BR> <BR>HTML is HTML.
    Javascript is Javascript. CSS is CSS. Designing with those tools, you can go a
    long way. Again, there&#39;s a few hiccups in IE/PC that you need to design around,
    but these aren&#39;t budget-doubling issues. Just small annoyances that--if you
    know about them--you can easily design around. <BR> <BR>This is really no different
    than in the real world. Building an accessible house isn&#39;t prohibitively more
    expensive. It does take a tad more planning. But once you know the jist of accessible
    design, it becomes a non-issue. <BR> <BR>&#34;Why do you think that you see so
    many websites which list only IE and some 4th gen version of NN as supported browsers?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Because there are a LOT of crappy, lazy web development firms that screw
    their clients...along with a LOT of crappy, old, out-of-date web sites. For whatever
    reason, a Fortune 500 company wouldn&#39;t dream of publishing an AR with an out-of-gamut
    photo, but thinks nothing of having their web site be completely inaccessible.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;he reason is that its just prohibitively expensive to test large
    functional websites on every browser/OS combination.&#34; <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
    argue you on this point. That&#39;s simply wrong. It takes me all of 5 minutes
    to test in all the major browsers. Plus, you don&#39;t NEED to test in EVERY browser...you
    just need to make sure it&#39;s accessible.  <BR> <BR>&#34;But the important thing
    about a browser, to me, is that I can use the sites I want to use. &#34; <BR>
    <BR>Oh sure. No argument there. I&#39;m just trying to make it clear that the
    reason there are a lot of IE-only sites is predominantly due to lazy/incompetant
    developers...rather than the myth that it&#39;s difficult to develop accessible
    web sites. &#40;FYI, Firefox can spoof its useragent, so you can get around a
    lot of sloppy browser detection scripts fairly easily.&#41; <BR>'

    a browser need to be for you not to bother testing? Still, its nice to see that

  body: 'Steve: <BR> <BR>I know where those stats are from. My point which I may not
    have made clear is that those are simply browser stats. They say nothing about
    the preferences of an actual user. I use IE day-in, day-out at work. I hate it.
    But I have to use it. So, when I visit sites, I&#39;m logged as an &#39;IE/PC&#39;
    user, when, in fact, I&#39;m much more of a &#39;Firefox/Mac&#39; user.  <BR>
    <BR>There isn&#39;t a lot of statistics based on this. I did a bit of research
    once and found a few folks that had access to large national web sites and were
    able to break down stats by time of day. After 5, they&#39;d see a 5% swing in
    the amount of Mac users, for example.  <BR> <BR>&#34;And in what way is it relevant
    if someone is not using the browser they want to use?&#34; <BR> <BR>If you go
    on those generic browser stats alone, you&#39;ll lock out some of your audience.
    If Mary logs into your site at noon to buy something with IE/PC great, you made
    a sale. When she gets home to buy another item, but you block her because she
    uses Firefox, well, you lost a sale...even though you pegged her as an IE/PC user.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Obviously, because there are no bugs in any other browsers...and
    they all implement flawless standards flawleslly <BR>Meanwhile back in the real
    world...&#34; <BR> <BR>What are you talking about, Steve? Did I say browsers had
    no bugs? Like I said, design to standards, fix the layout bugs in IE. Are there
    other bugs? Sure...but nothing major that will affect your site 99% of the time.
    If you have examples of this big Mozilla bugs that are a hindrance, please share
    them. <BR> <BR>&#34;1. What&#39;s a major browser? &#34; <BR> <BR>Windows: IE
    5&#43;, latest Opera, Latest Mozilla&#40;S&#41;, NN4 &#40;I still check that one&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>OSX: Latest Safari, Latest Mozilla&#40;s&#41;, Latest Opera, Latest Omniweb
    <BR> <BR>OS9: IE5 &#40;blech&#41; <BR> <BR>Linux: Konquerer <BR> <BR>Other: A
    text browser, JAWS, etc. <BR> <BR>&#34;2. Five minutes. What kind of web site
    is that? &#34; <BR> <BR>Pretty much any. It takes me less than 5 minutes to run
    my page through all of the above browsers. <BR> <BR>Again, if you&#39;re designing
    to standards, it&#39;s even less of a deal. When you do that, the only odd-ones
    out are IE/PC, IE/Mac and NN4...which there are plenty of well documented workarounds
    for their quirks. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not trying to bash you Steve...I&#39;m just
    trying to dispell the common myth that you &#40;and many many others&#41; perpetuate.
    This is part of the problem why you have to keep IE on your computer. Microsoft
    has developed a nice little catch-22 with their browser. Everyone uses because
    there are so many sites only developed with IE in mind. There are so many sites
    only developed with IE in mind because so many developers assume everyone uses
    IE on windows. This has pretty much enabled MS to not have to worry about fixing
    a badly broken and rather insecure browser. '

    so you&#39;re not downloading and using one monolithic do-it-all application,
    but lightweight, fast programs that do one thing well. So Thunderbird doesn&#39;t
    as such &#39;come with&#39; Firefox, but it&#39;s the mailreading arm of the SeaMonkey
    project. There are other side-projects, all being developed by community, such
    as the Sunbird calendar, which can also integrate with Thunderbird &#40;although
    the last time I tried it it was still awful buggy&#41;. <BR> <BR>And yeah, I can

    <BR> <BR>OK, I can spare 5 minutes for that, but Mozilla 1.7 has the same problems,
    so its not really a beta issue. <BR> <BR>While I&#39;m not naive enought to think
    that there&#39;s any software out there without bugs, I am quite prepared to believe
    that the problems with these sites <i>may</i> be that they have been authored
    for IE, and that it <i>may</i> be the site that&#39;s at fault, rather than the
    browser. Though it <i>may</i> be, a bug with the browser, so I&#39;ll try to find
    time to report the sites all the same. <BR> <BR>&#60;attempt-to-make-myself-clear-without-causing-a-row&#62;
    <BR>The point I was trying &#40;and failing&#41; to make to Darrel was, and is,
    that even where the website is at fault, if it doesn&#39;t work with Firefox or
    Mozilla, or Opera, or web TV, or Liberty boxes, its not necessarily down to lazy
    web developers. <BR>Often its down to budgets. And in the real world of corporate
    web development where testing takes place during <i>and</i> after development,
    it is a crucial and significant part of the development budget, which <b>does</b>

    it&#39;s not usually &#40;though it is sometimes&#41; valid, as developing cross-browser
    web sites, provided the developers know what they&#39;re doing, doesn&#39;t cost
    more. <BR> <BR>We simply disagree on this point. So be it. ;o&#41; ;o&#41; <BR>
    <BR>To be fair, part of the problem is the toolset given the developers. I do
    a lot of .net development these days and, surprise, surprise, .net favours IE
    on the front-end. So I need to go in and develop my own front-end interfaces for
    most widgets rather than depending on .net&#39;s built in widgets.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    worked with CMS tools that also favour only one specific browser. So, if the base
    set of tools is already flawed, then it&#39;s hard to blame the developers that
    need to work with said tool &#40;though I could blame the folks that decided on
