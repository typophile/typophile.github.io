body: 'I&#39;ve desperately been searching for a digital version of Herb Lubalin&#39;s
  Avant Garde, that is, the ORIGINAL &#40;from the late 60s, used in the magazine&#41;,
  not the book, gothic, condensed, or mono versions that I&#39;ve been finding everywhere
  else &#40;yes, including ITC and Linotype&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m fairly confident
  that it exists. I&#39;ve seen it used in designs here and there. <BR> <BR>for example,
  <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00004SBGD.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"> this Travis
  CD cover. </a> <BR> <BR>And this Japanese designer&#39;s webpage: <a href="http://www.nendo.com"

  world, so show me some love!  <BR> <BR>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
