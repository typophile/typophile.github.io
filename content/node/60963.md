  a file, InDesign informs me that there are some missing fonts. In the Missing files
  window there's a following list of missing fonts:\r\n\r\nITC Garamond Bold\r\nITC
  Garamond\r\nITC Garamond Light Italic\r\nITC Garamond Light\r\n\r\nAt first, I said
  to myself: \"WTF!? I have those fonts!\" But... After I checked my list of installed
  fonts, I saw that I only have ITC Garamond STD fonts. Also, on every font disc that
  I have, there's a ITC Garamond STD font family!\r\n\r\nWhere I can find ITCGaramond
  without this annoying STD attribute?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    the old Type 1 fonts (a.k.a. \"PostScript\").\r\n\r\nIn this particular case there
    might be tiny differences... the OpenType versions were made from the MM version
    of ITC Garamond.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
