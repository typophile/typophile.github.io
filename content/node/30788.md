    or leading? If the latter, you can adjust your default in Preferences > Paragraph

  body: "I'm not positive, but I think Chos is asking about setting the default leading
    value within the font itself (hence \"FL\" = FontLab). I'm curious about this
    myself as I'm not sure if the default leading is built into the font, or if InD/Quark
    simply uses a standard leading for any given type size. It seems to me it would
    be the former, as I've used fonts that seem to have insanely generous leading
    settings which need to be over-riden in InD.\r\n\r\nI'll be interested to see
    replies to this post from those more type-design/development inclined."

  body: I mean in the design of a font file itself. FontLab.It allows a number of
    ways to set up the metrics of a glyph, and to drag n' drop things. But at this
    point I seem to only be able to set up the leading by typing in numbers, rendering
    font, testing, changing numbers, rendering, testing. Due to a large funky 'f',
    I need to fiddle with things, 'til they are just so.

    calculation is. It does not seem to be built into the font.

  body: "Manual control of the default leading (I prefer the term line-spacing in
    digital work) is prepared for various operating systems' font renderers by the
    font itself, through the the *ascent, *descent, and similar font tables. As near
    as I can tell, there's a seperate set of figures for Windows, Mac, and OpenType.
    Which are all calculated differently. Its a backward-compatability induced pain.

  body: "The link William posted is the best one to look at. \"TypoLineGap\" is the
    item but each software package that you use to output may have a different notion
    of what to do with it. Twenty-percent is a good rule of thumb but when you have
    ascenders and decenders pushing beyond, you get some weird stuff to deal with.
    Compare a script flourished like Kunstler or Bickham with Helvetica Neue and see
    the difference. \r\nUsers who regularly use the \"Auto\" leading are not the most
    typography savvy. Most often, experienced typographers will set leading exactly
    to the quantity that suits their job at hand. Line length and H&J are factors
    too. Longer lines tend to need more leading. Auto rarely fits the bill. There
    is no magic bullet to test. I set up a file with assorted leadings, line lengths,
    and sizes to test a typeface.  After setting up the file, I change the typeface
    to whatever I am testing and reprint it every time I make a revision to the font.
    You can compare the effect of your modifications this way.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: ">can\u2019t you just increase the body size\r\n\r\nYou can always rescale
    the glyphs relative to the em, but that's only part of the story. InDesign, things
    are clear: it will scale em to the size specified, put the top of the ascenders
    at the top of the text box, and the next line below that exactly at the body size
    plus the leading you have specified--with a default of 20% of em leading. In Word
    and other word processing programs there are different defaults, and I understand
    these are based partly on the line gap information you specify. \r\n\r\nHere the
    problem is of setting a default--a default that won't cut off the extenders or
    diacritics, but will also not give too much leading, and across different platforms
    and applications. And the problem is that you don't have full control because
    the application will take your information and do with it what it wants. --And
    then the user can vary that. So you just want a default that a. people won't find
    weird and b. makes sense for your font. \r\n\r\nFor information on best practices
    for getting a good default across platforms and applications--oh and font formats
    too--take John Hudson's fun vertical metrics hell ride on the typowiki.  \r\n\r\nEdit:
    I just saw David's post, which tells you how to look at the default with zero
    leading in FontLab. (\\n makes a new line) The technical complications have to
    do with the 'line gap' stuff, and the impact of that on defaults in word processors,
    and on different platforms etc."

    a bunch of different vertical metrics, and a bunch of different ways applications

    don't. As a designer, I want that control, not to have it built into a font. You
    get to decide the design esthetics within the point size (ascender, descender,

    your job well, and I promise I will do mine as well as I can."

  body: "Depends how your typeface looks like. Does it have extremely long ascenders
    and descenders, or modest ones?\r\n\r\nAll is said in John Hudson's \"How To\"
    (Paul Hunt's link), but I'll emphasize two things:\r\n\r\nYou should define [OS/2]
    usWinAscent and usWinDescent such that the values equal or exceed the longest
    ascender (or accent) in the font, and the longest descender (or accent) in the
    font.\r\nSame for [hhea] Ascender and Descender.\r\n[Footnote to Thomas Phinney's
    post: BBox holds information about longest ascending and longest descending of
    glyph outlines found in the entire font.]\r\nThis because: If the former values
    are too small, parts of glyphs that are larger than that may be clipped in some
    applications. If the latter values are too small, glyphs may be squashed in some
    older Mac applications -- funny effect but not desired.\r\n\r\n[OS/2] TypoAscender
    and TypoDescender should, together, make the UPM value. (This is not a must, though.)\r\nThis
    also means: if you begin designing/digitizing a typeface, you should <cite>at
    first</cite> measure its glyphs carefully, and make sure that <cite>average</cite>
    ascenders and descenders (as of \"h\", \"l\", \"j\", \"p\") fit, with a little
    additional space, into the UPM. Which usually but not necessarily equals 1000
    in PS-outline fonts.\r\nFor the few apps which calculate line spacing based on
    TypoAscender and TypoDescender, you now have defined the minimum line spacing.\r\n\r\nOne
    more note: If you deal with a family, you should calculate values based on the
    style with the largest ascendings/descendings, and use these values for all family
    members. In case someone relies on default line spacing, you would not want that
    this changes if some lines are set in Bold only and others in Italics only ...\r\n\r\nAnother
    description is <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf\">here</a>,
    slightly different but in the essence it's the same as John Hudson's. The example
    on page 3 may demonstrate that it is not that complicated.\r\n"
