    known edible type is probably the traditional chocolate letters found in The Netherlands.

    Piggly-Wiggly, Giant Eagle or 7-11 and grab a can of over-processed pasta drenched

  body: Of course the highest form of type design is through the sculpting of negative
    space by methodically biting into a largish slab of chocolate. That&#39;s the
    only way the White and the Brown can truly harmonize. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I used to make letters with rubber bands... but rubber bands aren&#39;t very
    appetizing. If you could eat type, I wonder what it would taste like. I&#39;d
    like to see what filosofia taste like. Maybe because it reminds me of tea and
    crumpets.

    chocolate substitute.  Which is incredibly sad.  <BR>The Dutch ones earlier on
