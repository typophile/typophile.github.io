  it. And I was wondering what these might equate to in famous equivalents. I'm guessing
  some of you could do this with one eye tied behind your back.\r\n: )\r\nThere are
  three I like. Nibus has the most versions. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nimbus.gif]\r\n\r\nGrotesk\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grotesk.gif]\r\n\r\nModern

  body: The middle one isn't Avenir--Avenir has a two-story "a". It looks more like
    Avenir's uppercase with Futura lower case and Myriad numerals.

  body: It's actually URW Grotesk by Hermann Zapf, it's not really derivative like
    Nimbus Sans (Helvetica). Futura and Avenir would be more than suitable as an alternative,
    not as a "equivalent".

    exactly is your motive? If you're looking for suggestions for an alternative to
    these fonts, perhaps you could take this to the Design forum?"

    context some of the comments I see when people are recommending things. Since
    I don't have many of the fonts you guys do, I wanted to know if I had anything
    close. Sort of future reference, I guess."
