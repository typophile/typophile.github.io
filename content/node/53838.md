  way I can export these sets for the benefit my colleagues too?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: "Hi, i was waiting for some answer because I am curios about export from Font
    Explorer too. There is only one Export function in top menu. Choose Font > Export
    and then decide what do you want to export: fonts, images of fonts or only information
    about fonts in your set. Is it helpful?\r\n\r\nPremysl"

  body: "Premysl - the export function (I think) allows you to collect the original
    font files together to take to another computer (in the same way you would collect
    fonts for output in a Quark document), rather than exporting the sets themselves.\r\n\r\nMalcolm
    - fontbase looks like the sort of thing I'm after. Do you use it?\r\n\r\nDave"
