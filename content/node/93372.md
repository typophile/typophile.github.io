  right.  If you check the picture AJ2, that is a picture of Univers in Word, next
  to a picture of what I'm trying to find. \r\n\r\nI believe I need a stockier Univers
  edition... any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n**  Original Post **\r\n\r\nHey
  all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out the font that was used on my United States
  Military Academy t-shirt, printed in 1998.\r\n\r\nI know that the t-shirt comes
  from Unicor.gov, a federal clothing and textile factory used to rehabilitate inmates.\r\n\r\nThe
  shirt is pretty old, and has been washed a bunch... \r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nDerek"
