body: Greetings Typophile People! <BR> <BR>I have been reading the forum for some
  time and thought I should at the least say &#39;Hello&#39;. <BR> <BR>I have been
  amazed at the excellent content and contributors to this forum and look forward
  to taking part. <BR> <BR>Some brief info - I am in Western NY. I work as a director
  at a graphic design/biz communication firm. I love type and all arts and crafts
  related to the history and making of books. <BR> <BR>I have no type designs to my
  credit. I have dabbled with fontographer and would like to delve deeper into type
  design. Also, I have tried bookbinding this last winter and enjoyed it. <BR> <BR>I
  have a desire to mess around with letterpress printing soon, but space for equipment
  is an issue for now. <BR> <BR>I guess that is about it. Thanks for reading this!
  <BR> <BR>Mike

  body: We should just start a chatroom.  heh. <BR> <BR>Mike, nope, I don&#39;t use
    Kakaze or my full name on ADG.  I started using the news groups under another
    name to help a friend of mine in an argument and after the argument I poked around
    and found groups such as ADG and just never changed the name.  I should change
    it eventually, to separate myself from my &#34;normal&#34; groups from my more
    off colour groups.
