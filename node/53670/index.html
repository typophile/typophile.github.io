<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mortgage Refinancing Tips<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first<!-- raw HTML omitted --> important <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mortgage refinancing loan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tip is that you should always interview your loan officer. This person will be handling your  finances. You should at least like them. Many people make the mistake of only asking about rates. Instead, you should ask about their experience and see how they feel about the market. Ask them for some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mortgage  Refinance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and see how they react. Are they  friendly and helpful? Do they sound irritated? Go with your instincts to find a loan officer that suits you best.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, make sure  that this is the best loan for you. You  may be persuaded to go with a loan that isn&rsquo;t in your best interest, so it&rsquo;s your responsibility to figure out what is best for you. One way to do that is to compare the benefits of the loan with the total cost of the loan. For example, benefits of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mortgage  refinancing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  loan could be monthly savings and lower  interest rate, while the cost could be high fees. Ask your self if the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Refinance Loan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  meets your needs. Have your loan officer  explain all options until you fully understand what is being presented to you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The third tip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is to discuss all fees with your loan officer. Remember, fees are how loan officers get paid and you should know how much you are paying your loan officer. Loan officers are often willing to negotiate their fees as well. They are paid by points, with one point being one percent of the total loan amount. Ask your loan officer how many points they are willing to do your loan for.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last tip<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is to  get a good faith estimate. A good faith estimate  is a list of all fees and costs associated with your loan. All loan officers are required to give a good  faith estimate to the borrower. This  should be completed within three days of applying for the loan.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So what do you look  for in a good faith estimate of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mortgage refinancing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Look over all fees such as processing, appraisal, title, escrow and especially the yield spread premium. Loan officers can get paid additional points by the lender to sell you a higher interest rate. You may be paying the loan officer 2 points for their services, while the lender will be paying them 1 more point on the back end of the deal. So in the end, they end up with 3 points. You may be  okay with this and you may not. If not, be sure to discuss it with your loan officer and get him to either reduce his origination fees or get a lower interest rate.We all want to save money and a mortgage refinance is a  great way to do that. Be an informed borrower, find a good loan officer and you&rsquo;ll avoid having a big headache. I hope these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mortgage refinancing tips<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will be useful to you.</p>
