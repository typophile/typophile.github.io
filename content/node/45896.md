body: "EDIT: My reason for this post\r\n\r\nI am starting a blog devoted purely to
  ambigrams. I was wondering who has done them before (as I have a few on my own)
  and who would like to contribute some of their work, sketches, and maybe a quick
  write-up about the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you've ever done any of these, interested
  in doing one, or in the process of creating one, shoot me an email please to npgraphicdesign@yahoo.com.
  I'll email you back with more details, why I am asking for this, etc.\r\n\r\nA short
  wikipedia link describing ambigrams - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram\r\n\r\nThese
  are ambigrams btw..\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ad2_5056.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ad1_4882.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nAs some of you know from my Typophile or HOW Magazine
    forum posts, I'm starting up a blog devoted solely to ambigrams. Rather than have
    this blog be just a showcase of work, I would like it to be as much about the
    process as it is about the final product. So, this is what I'm asking the participants
    to contribute. I know that everyone is busy with work, life, family, etc. So submit
    what you can, and lets have a blast!!\r\n\r\nEmail to send the submissions to:\r\nambigblog@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRequired
    part of the submission:\r\na. One ambigram in jpg/gif/tiff format. You do not
    have to size it down to a specific size, as I will take care of that.\r\nb. A
    few sentences about your ambigram. Include who the client was, whether it was
    a personal or freelance project, and why you decided to use an ambigram for the
    specific project. Include a sentence or two (or three) about your thought process
    if you can!!\r\nc. The most important part: SKETCHES! More so than the work, I'd
    love to see the process. So any sketches you have, whether it's 1 or 10 sketches
    showing the creative process, please scan them in and send them to me. I will
    resize them and convert them to the appropriate file format. And the sketches
    do not have to be perfect; they can be as doodle-esque or unorganized as you want
    them to be, as long as they are SOMEWHAT clear ;) If you don't have any sketches,
    that's perfectly fine. I would still love to have your submissions for the blog!\r\n\r\nOptional
    part of the submission:\r\na. More than one ambigram. I would like everyone to
    submit at least ONE. But if you have to time to submit more than one, along with
    sketches, descriptions, etc., why not??\r\n\r\nInclude the following with your
    submissions (only if you want to!):\r\na. A URL to your work (if you want people
    to look at your other work as well)\r\nb. Your real name or a monicker (could
    be a forum nickname, could be another nickname, etc) but someway to identify yourselves\r\n\"I
    will not post any of your personal contact info, email, URL, name or otherwise
    without your explicit permission.\"\r\n\r\nAnd finally, spread the word! I want
    this to be a website about ambigrams, about the process, and about networking
    and getting to know artists that have similar interests! If you know anyone who
    is interested in ambigrams, who has created them before, or wants to take a crack
    at it, send forward this email to them or have them shoot me an email with some
    questions, which I will be more than happy to answer.\r\n\r\nSome other things
    to be included on the website: interviews with artists and well known designers
    that specialize in ambigrams and typography, case studies, etc. I will shoot out
    periodic emails informing everyone of new developments!\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!
    Looking forward to all the great work!\r\n\r\nNikita"

    Fe Samelson called 'Letterforms and Illusion'. It was based on Scott Kim's book
    'Inversions' that he published in 1981 (see illustration). There was a design
    page in the magazine OMNI which explored ambigrams, probably also by Scott Kim.
