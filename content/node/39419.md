body: "Hi, I'm making a short film where people pose as letters, to make words in
  groups, that respond to a voice over poem.. I've been trying to research images,
  typogreaphys, or other people who might have done something similar.. have found
  nothing... The work is to be filmed with the people standing up, not laying down...
  was wondering if any people here had any ideas on how to design the people letters..
  maybe collaborate a bit.. I've done a similar film before, but it didn;t really
  work as the people didn;t really look that much like the letters, i need to design
  them more strongly. Also was thinking fo puuting in some kind of elastic band thing,
  that they pull to give the letters an outline, though only an idea at mo. Please
  hlep as woule love to make something great, looking at this site made me realise
  I know nothing about typ.. here is link to previous work.....thanks\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=PJ4sI2_amM4"

  body: 'that''s great, see lots of people had a similar idea to myself.. the angels
    image is great for the design of letters.. my only prob is that allot of the moves,
    and some of the letters can only be created using dancers, and in phtoshop, such
    as v as it defies gravity, also all nude, and my peole will have clothes and some
    will be old... but great starting point. Should I look for someway of uniting
    the people, allot of comment to the video was to make an outline.. but don;t want
    to do this after in post, was thinking of some string or stick thng to make the
    outline live in the video.. any thought.. but thanks again for this marvelous
    help, I''m suprised none of this came up in my searches... shows some limitation
    to goolge, as put in lots of combos,  '
