		<div class="commentbody">A number of designers dislike Compatil (and Unica, and other rational fonts), and some of them possibly because they consider themselves artists (whether they admit it or not), and the worlds of expression and logic are partly opposed. So something that makes a lot of sense is in a way threatening to the &quot;culture&quot; of some type designer. Artists can make some types of fonts better than craftsmen, and the other way around too. But even though no person is purely one or the other, the more you're close to one extreme of the axis the more liable you are to focus your hatred on the other extreme. Very few people can be both at one extreme and appreciative of the other extreme. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Let explain me a bit more, <BR> <BR>I have nothing against such concept of various styles on a same family (well I have done one myself, hum). There is some good use of that, and many families demonstrated good design solution for that concept for long (JvK, Unger, Stone, Majoor, etc). <BR> <BR>But what I can't &quot;accept&quot; on Compatil is the way they tried to fit all forms on one same unique structure, missing that the different style can stick to same set of basic forms. Its a too universal approche for my eye. <BR> <BR>&quot;Oldstyle&quot; have some obvious characteristics, &quot;Sans&quot; others, etc. If not adjusted with sensibility, your design quickly became a monster, and some element of Compatil are like that, the various styles can't be &quot;Compatibles.&quot; <BR> <BR>Another thing (from my actual knowledge, based on the type specimen), is pretending doing a universal family but providing no italic is a bit bizarre. <BR> <BR>Last, when you look at the design itself of the letterforms, well, the letterforms not balance well to the eyes, like the Frutiger Next too when Avenir Next is wonderful compared.</div>

A style's preferred characteristics (for example that an old-style should have a smaller x-height*) are important, but not sacrosanct - matching apparent size between the styles for example can be just as important. It depends on the intent, and because it &quot;bends&quot; the styles, Compatil becomes more useful in certain ways it couldn't have if it didn't bend them. <BR> <BR>* Which is why Iowan Old-Style for example seems awkward - we probably agree. (Although the caps are great.) <BR> <BR>&gt; providing no italic is a bit bizarre. <BR> <BR>That I can agree with, even though I believe that for <i>users</i> slanted Romans aren't as bad as we might like to think. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of comments at the 'Making Faces' seminar in New York last week are relevant to the issue of whether the 'brief' for Compatil is a good or a misguided idea. <BR> <BR>Matthew Carter was asked about his redesigns of Cheltenham for the New York Times. The questioner noted that some of the titles that had before been in different typefaces were now being taken over more and more by Cheltenham. Was this a loss? <BR> <BR>Carter said that whether to use more or fewer faces was really a matter for the Times to decide, but he personally didn't really see any advantage to a great many faces. He explained that historically the same face was just not available in different sizes and weights, so newspapers were more or less forced to use many typefaces. He did note that he designed, IIRC, five different versions of Cheltenham for the Times, for different uses.  <BR> <BR>The other comment was from David Berlow in answer to a question about the proliferation of families with a huge variety of weights and widths - much in evidence in both the Font Bureau and the HFJ foundry's faces. He retorted &quot;We didn't start this you know,&quot; &ndash;explaining that the demand for a variety of weights and widths came from publications themselves. <BR> <BR>Reinforcing the merit of a variety of weights was another comment from Matthew Carter. He was in general refreshingly modest, but one slide he was clearly proud of, saying 'this is where I earn my keep.' It was a picture of a serif face with 3 different weights superimposed. The lines of the different weights were close, but the relationship between the different weights was clearly non-linear, and the serifs and joins were treated differently.    <BR> <BR>What I took from this was that all the optical and other adjustments of a face for different sizes and uses in a publication is actually quite useful and valuable, but the multiplication of faces in a single publication is questionable.</div>
