    is Emigre's BlockheadUnplugged;\r\n\r\n I'm not sure what the other one is. Note
    the differences between two different uses of the letter 'S'. \r\n\r\nThe second,
    lighter one is from BlockheadUnplugged. The first, darker one is not, and as far
    as I can tell, it's not from any other weight of Blockhead."

  body: "I think that 'scrappers'  might be used only for the bicycle image. The wording
    itself is actually an image (.png), as found with 'view page info' in Firefox.
    \ I found the reference to BlockheadUnplugged in a flash file elsewhere on the
    site.\r\n\r\nAnd a question for Ryuk: How do you get to the CSS to look at and
    interpret it?\r\n\r\n  - Herb VB"

  body: '''scrappers'' is actually used on the as webfont. Very easy to check it using
    [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm|WhatFont
    Chrome Extension]]. With this extension, you can easily inspect web fonts by just
    hovering on them. I agree the top main menu is actually made with images but when
    hovering "welcome to oregon" (bottom left), it reveals ''scrappers''.'

  body: "Hello all. I'm the Creative Director at Substance (http://findsubstance.com),
    the agency responsible for the design of the Travel Oregon site.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the fonts, we used a variety of them... the top navigation is a font called Scrappers,
    which was custom-made for the client. There are some variants in the font so that's
    why you're seeing two different S's. Because of the control we wanted over the
    layout and active states for the top navigation, we ended up making those graphical,
    but everywhere else across the site where you see Scrappers it is displayed using
    @font-face. Regarding Emigre's Blockhead - we had used Blockhead prior to having
    the custom Scrappers font in the Flash file on the Cities & Regions page, so that
    reference might be a legacy item in the Flash file.\r\n\r\nFor the slab serif
    font, we wanted to use Hoefler & Frere-Jones font Archer (http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033),
    but unfortunately they haven't created a web font solution yet. Instead, we're
    using the Google font Rokkitt (http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Rokkitt)
    for headlines, and Sanchez (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/sanchez/)
    for italic slab serif uses. Unfortunately Rokkitt doesn't have an italic version
    of their font and the psuedo-italic the browser was rendering didn't look very
    good. Hopefully once H&FJ has a @font-face solution, we can implement that."

    it's one of the best-rendering webfonts out there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The Scrappers font was used originally by having to piece together a handwritten
    set of characters, so it was pretty time consuming to write out long messages.
    And of course for web use, we also needed a full character set we could dynamically
    use and display. Prior to having Scrappers converted to a font format we could
    use, we chose Blockhead for dynamic text because it looked kind of similar. So
    Scrappers wasn't derived from Blockhead; we chose Blockhead because it was close
    to what we were doing with the handwritten Scrappers font.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for
    the link to FF Ernestine. Looks like a good option instead of Archer, especially
    if H&FJ aren't going to come out with a @font-face solution anytime soon."

  body: "OK, good to know about Scrappers - thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nNote
    that Ernestine has a large x-height which makes\r\nit particularly suitable for
    onscreen typography, plus\r\nthe wizards at FontFont (I think it was Jens Kutilek
    in\r\nthis case) did an incredible job hinting it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "You bet.\r\n\r\nOne challenge we've had with Rokkitt is the baseline height
    is kind of weird (and limited from a font weight standpoint), which makes it a
    bit challenging, so Ernestine looks like a good replacement that might be easier
    to control."
