body: 'What is the proper way to set things such as "VoiceXML" or "VoIP"? With other
  acronyms, I use true smallcaps with extra letterspacing. However, I''m not sure
  what to do with the lowercase letters in the middle of the acronyms. Do I set it
  all in smallcaps? Do I ditch the small caps and set it using both u&l?


  I''m redesigning my resume (a computer networking guy) as I read through Bringhurst''s
  book (with an interest in type). In the "Skills" area of my resume, I have a bunch
  of acronyms listed such as TCP/IP, BGP, HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, etc. Included in this
  list are the above mixed case acronyms.


  Any pointers would be appreciated.


  Thanks,

  Pete

    acronymns and the U&lc thing for the mixed-case terms. Besides, do you REALLY
    think that anybody who reads your r\xE9sum\xE9 (besides, perhaps the editors of
    <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>) is going to have any better idea of the
    RIGHT way to do it?"

    look a bit ackward, maybe not much (depends on the typeface) but you could have
    problems distinguishing smallcap v, x, z, o, s, k, c or w from their lowercase

  body: using smallcaps only for VoIP and others would be wrong. in my opinion. try
    to mix smallcaps and lc, if it doesnt fit, use normal caps instead.
