body: Hello there, <BR> <BR>this logo is for a local printer and design studio. &#40;They
  do mainly printing, hence the &#34;ink&#34; idea..&#41; <BR> <BR>Please let me know
  what you think. I would first appreciate some feedback on the &#34;tg&#34; symbol
  &#40;since I&#39;m not too happy about the font for the name yet anyway.&#41;  <BR>I
  am not sure if the execution of the ink drop is good enough. what about the colour?
  w/ or w/o the dot? <BR> <BR>thanks for your comments, <BR>s <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48027.gif"

  body: i like the one on the right bottom.. but I&#39;d move &#34;technografik&#34;
    slightly to the left so that it is in one line with the red dot above..

  body: 'Samann: <BR> <BR>I like this concept a lot. There seems to be a little disharmony
    between the &#34;t&#34; and &#34;g&#34; caused by the extremely organic feel that
    the squiggly, ink drop and ear create in the &#34;g&#34;. The &#34;g&#34; is a
    living creature, but the &#34;t&#34; is not. I don&#39;t really have any suggestions
    to remedy it at this point'

  body: Samann cool stuff I like the concept. I aggree with what Scott has stated.
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps you can use the entire &#39;g&#39; and make the ear appear to
    be an ink drop. <BR>Also what kind of inks are being used? I ask this because
    it might help you choose a color better suited for this design. For example, if
    soy inks &#40;a more environment friedly ink&#41; are being used maybe you can
    choose a color that reflects that idea. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: Samann, the ink drop makes me think of a mistake. Sloppy Printing? Its the
    reason you see symbols of percision like register marks or color bars. Just some
    thoughts.

  body: I agree with Dan, <BR> <BR>Precision, is what I look for in a printer. A printer
    should appear very organized in their identity. What kind of printing do they
    do? Do they have a 4 or 2 color press, or a digital output device? The name Technographic
    also implies &#34;precision&#34;, Why not use properties of advaced printing technology
    to determine the logo.

  body: 'Hello there, <BR> <BR>thanks everyone for all your valuable comments. I have
    taken especially Daniel&#39;s opinion to heart in that the first proposal with
    the ink drop might look like sloppy printing. <BR> <BR>Some more information on
    the company:  <BR>The company started about 20 years ago and did mainly technical
    drawings &#40;hence the name&#41;. Although the name has stayed, the company sees
    itself now more as an advertising agency. They can handle both the design and
    production side of the project.  <BR>Production wise they do offset printing,
    digital &#40;laser, plotter&#41;, etc. but they also have creatives who design
    layouts, invitations, brochures, annual books, etc. They also have a new collection
    with specially designed&#43;produced cards &#40;e.g. for weddings&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>So, as you can see they are technical but &#40;what they want to stress&#41;
    very creative. Therefore the company name probably does no justice to their full
    skills &#40;but they don&#39;t want to change it for now.&#41; Therefore I also
    tried to create a symbol that shows a little more of their creativity, rather
    than &#34;precision&#34; and technicality. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a quick look at
    the current logo: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48348.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>I have now gone away from the first idea with the drop and
    tried to create something that is more resembling the idea of the old whilst at
    the same time modernising it and implying more creative freedom.  <BR>Here&#39;s
    what I came up with so far: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48349.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48350.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>I tried to stick to the same concept and by using a simplified
    geometric figure that is hand-drawn I tried to signify the dual nature of the
    company. Before I worry about vectorising this &#40;if at all possible?!&#41;
    I wanted to get your input.  <BR> <BR>Does it work? Is it practical? Can it be
    implemented with vectors?  <BR> <BR>thanks for your comments, <BR>s'

  body: mmm I would guess that the car manufacturer&#39;s identity and this printer&#39;s
    identity would be well distanced as it is, and the sketch logo bears only basic
    geometric resemblance.   <BR> <BR>I think the new direction is a good one, but
    I would maybe try to focus a little bit on weighting the sketch to be a little
    more like the original, if you want to focus on updating rather than reinventing.  <BR>
    <BR>I can also see that this is in early stages, and I think things are going
    well! <BR> <BR>aaron

  body: Hi Adriano, <BR> <BR>good catch - I can&#39;t imagine I was thinking of Renault
    at all though while I was &#40;re&#41;designing it ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>does anyone
    else think that the logo with its rough, draftish look resembles the Renault logo?
    any other comments whether I should be heading into the pursued direction or not?

  body: Samann, since its a creative group and not just a printer, take your roughs
    and run them by the creatives and let them guide you in a direction that best
    fits the companies perception of itself. Coming here is fine, but don&#39;t step
    on any toes, politically.
