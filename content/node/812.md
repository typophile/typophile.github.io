body: Hi everyone. <BR> <BR>This is an idea i&#39;ve been kicking around this summer
  and  <BR>wanted to get your reaction. It started as sketches that had  <BR>the diagonal
  break in the bowls, over time it became more  <BR>economical in width. I will certainly
  need loads of help with  <BR>the forthcoming italics. What do you think so far?

  body: I like it. One thing I noticed right off was that the bottom serifs on both
    the a and b look almost like mistakes&#40;bumps&#41;when I&#39;m not focused directly
    on them. IMHO the serifs might need to be a little more pronounced. I usually
    don&#39;t post since I&#39;m just starting out learning about typography, but
    this struck me purely on an asthetic level.

    made me wish the &#34;e&#34; had the same flair. It would be interesting to see
    a closeup of the b, h, p etc. Does the diagonal stroke meet the curve at a point?
    If so, what would it look like if this was more exagerated or obviously angled?

    uses the vertical Cartesian space in different proportions in terms of ascender,

    to the reader, and the descenders almost nothing. You still have to balance that
    against the importance of diverging boumas, but irrespective of the proportion

    <BR> <BR>a&#41; round the serifs? <BR>b&#41; sharpen the joins? <BR> <BR>This
    has some garamondation to it which makes me lean  <BR>toward rounding the serifs.
    Not sure though. Shorter  <BR>decenders it is.  <BR> <BR>Tom, tried the a-style
    beak terminal on the s, c , f and r. It  <BR>hurt legibility bigtime. But I don&#39;t
    want to lose it in the &#34;a&#34;  <BR>as it&#39;s one of my favorite parts.  <BR>

    angular version of Poppl Pontifex &#40;<a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?U6"
    target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/show?U6</a>&#41;, although it really
    is quite different in many respects. <BR> <BR>The only thing I might suggest so
    far is to try thinning the join of the lower-case &#34;a&#34; where the bottom
    of the bowl meets the main stem above the tail. It looks a bit dark there, and
    might clog up a bit at smaller sizes, or at least muddy up a bit. That might help
    alleviate the &#34;flat tire&#34; look that Kris mentioned. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also
    apply the same aesthetic that you applied to &#34;hamb&#34; above to all of the
    curves. The lower-case &#34;f&#34;, &#34;t&#34; and &#34;s&#34; seem to want similar
    treatment. <BR> <BR>Nicely done. This will be a font to watch. <BR> <BR>David

    hard diagonal theme i have working in the a, b, d, g,h, m, n, p, q, r, s ... we&#39;ll
    see. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post up a new pdf tomorrow -- Randy

    <BR>I still think it&#39;s a little squarish... And the top curve doesn&#39;t
    seem to be &#34;flowing&#34; right. But it&#39;s much better indeed. :] <BR>'
