  body: The term editorial generally refers to the content. It can include books,
    periodicals (mags and newspapers) and even web sites. Promotional materials -
    brochures, ads, posters - are not editorial.

  body: "Hmm...okay. SO I heard editorial can be anything. I sure heard right but
    it's wrong. Thank you.\r\n\r\nOlho: I know dictionaries are good but I needed
    a broader view on it in forms of mediums.\r\nPatty: Do you mean certain websites
    i.e The Sunday Times or the Guardian or ANY website? "

  body: Editorial content in magazines refers to the part of the magazine the editor
    is responsible for. It's the portion of content that isn't advertising. It's the
    part of the magazine that is meant to attract readers who, presumably, will also
    look at the ads. From the point of view of the editorial staff, the ads only exist
    to support the editorial content. From the point of view of the advertisers, the
    editorial content only exists to attract potential customers to see their ads.
    There is usully some antagonism between the two. ;-)

  body: Or in a news sense, it is the opinion writing rather than the "factual reporting",
    cough cough.

  body: It's kind of a jargon thing. When a designer says they prefer to work on "editorial"
    projects, they don't mean the opinion page in the newspaper. It means they don't
    want to work in advertising or marketing.

  body: "missgiggles, yes obviously on a newpaper or magazine's web site the same
    distinction (editorial vs promotional) would apply. But IMHO it could also apply
    to a web site such as Design Observer which has written articles. \r\n\r\nI would
    not apply the term \"editorial\" to just any web site, certainly not to social
    networking sites like Facebook, portals such as Yahoo, or utterly inane sites
    like Twitter. Definitely not to commerce sites, altho Amazon contains some editorial
    content (the reviews), as do sites that review, say, digital cameras. Those sites
    probably have staff editors working specifically on editorial content."
