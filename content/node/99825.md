  body: "[EDITED to include variants first listed by ChristTrekker--duh! :p ]\r\n\r\nbbg,
    I'm curious about your comment where you say \"most:\"\r\n\"Most versions with
    square serifs are based on versions derived via early postscript stroke fonts
    . . .\"\r\n\r\nIf most of them were derived of early postscript stroke fonts,
    I'm curious about any that were not (especially if they were based on actual typewriter
    type). I'm curious to find any Courier variant which is derived of (or inspired
    by) actual typewriter type heads, but which is modified to have sharp corners
    on serifs, stroke ends etc.\r\n\r\nhrant, if I may ask . . . how is progress coming
    on the (Courier-related?) design which I presume you must be working on, based
    on a comment you made? :)\r\n\r\nAll,\r\n\r\nI think a list of Courier variants
    would make a great TypeWiki page; OR it could be a section of a page on Courier.
    (And there isn't any page about Courier, as I write this!)\r\n\r\nHere's my start,
    which does not include all pertinent information available to me . . . If I would
    be welcome to copy this as a page stub to TypeWiki, I'd be happy to--or I welcome
    anyone else to.\r\n\r\nA question that arises: what \"Typewriter\" typefaces may
    <em>not</em> be derived of Courier (or certainly are not), yet resemble it? Where
    would METAFONT/Computer Modern fit in the list?\r\n\r\nReference; NOTE that most
    of these have lists (even quite long ones) which were not incorporated into the

  body: "[A year and two months later...]\r\n\r\nWow, sorry I missed your question.\r\n\r\nFunny,
    I had completely forgotten I made that font (and I seem to have lost my development
    sources). It must have been a two-hour affair. I therefore can't answer your question.\r\n\r\nSo
    I went and looked up my forgotten work. It could probably only be selectively
    usable for designs with a deliberate \"malformed\" look. Here it is, for the curious:\r\n\r\nhttp://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono\r\n\r\nI
    do recall it was inspired by Averia, which fascinates me despite that I have no
    use for the result :) and I also remember trying to select the most disparate-appearing
    fonts among all those I blended.\r\n\r\nMaybe it could form a reference background
    to inspire sketches of a new monospace font that is in some sense a stylistic
    blend or average of so many fonts. I don't plan on that.\r\n\r\nI don't suppose
    it's easily possible hunt down and list all typewriter-ish monospace fonts. (Maybe
    some expensive reference sold to type designers has done so already, besides.)
    Obviously, I forsook the effort, although I still think it would make a fascinating
    wiki article.\r\n\r\nhrant, have I missed any posts about your experiment?"
