  i have to do some logo restyling for those clients. However, they also want a vector
  version of their original logos. Unfortunately, they don't know the typefaces used.
  One resemble a bit eurostile but it has angled serif. Another it's similar to Bodoni
  but there are some differencies, like the straight leg of the R. I'm also interested
  in the neon-like font, but i suspect it's something from a free font site and i
  will have to probably retrace it.\r\n\r\nI have searched myfont and used what the
  font but haven't found any suitable match. Hope i can find some help from the experts
  here! \r\n\r\nThanks"
