body: "Hi\r\nNot sure if the build forum is the correct place for this or not, but
  here goes... \r\nIt seems that certain customers (well, one customer) is having
  problems with one of my fonts in MS Word on a Mac. Whenever they try to use the
  font in Word, they get a 'Bad Font Detected' error message which goes on to say
  that the system will try to disable the font. \r\nIn my own testing, I can't get
  the same error message, and MyFonts checked it on a few different Macs in Word and
  it was ok. Since then they have been able to get the same error message using Mac
  OSX 10.7.3 with MS Word 2011. I can only test it using Mac OSX 10.6.8 with Word
  2008, where it works fine. It also works without any problems in all other programs
  on Mac and all programs on Windows.\r\nI can't find anything in the font file itself
  that would cause the error message, and out of more than a thousand licenses there
  has been only this one complaint. It seems to me it is a problem with Word (certain
  versions) on Macs (certain versions!) rather than with my font, but it's still going
  to mean refunding the customer for a font that is otherwise fine.\r\nHas anyone
  had similar issues, and if so, could you find anything in your fonts that was causing
  them?\r\nMany thanks for any help in this matter,\r\nDave"

    in Word in the first place, but as they are trying to do so, I need a way that
    it works there.

  body: They installed using Fontbook, and it validated fine, but then didn't work
    in Word. I tested it on a Mac the exact same way and it validated fine but also
    worked fine in Word. It really does feel like it's a problem with Word but I can't
    really say to the customer that it's Microsoft's problem, not mine! So if anyone
    has come up against the same problem and found a fix, I'd be very grateful to
    know it.

    no more than a Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic styles for a single Family

    it appears that multiple styles CAN be within a family, even in a Windows and/or

  body: The font I'm having problems with is a single weight display script, so any
    problems with naming can't be the cause of my problem. But naming of larger families
    is a ball-ache if you want them to work in Word etc.

    solving a problem like this. It's worth a try, if your font can stand the conversion
    of PS outlines to TT outlines."

  body: Make sure that the customer's file (of your font) is not corrupted. Have them
    uninstall the font and then reinstall a new, just-downloaded, version. Don't assume
    that just because the original file got validated that it's okay.

    works ok. Interestingly, I asked them to test some of my other fonts (all postscript
    opentype) and there were no issues with them, so I'm still at a loss as to what
    was actually causing the issue (Panose values in both otf and ttf files were 2
    0 0 0 0 etc.)\r\nAnyway, at least I have a fix for the small amount of people
    using display fonts in Word (2011) on Mac (OSX 10.7.x), although I'm still inclined
    to believe it's a problem with certain versions of Word rather than my font!!"

    been shipped with TrueType-flavoured fonts in the last 20 years and especially
    Office app are mainly targeted to the use of TrueType-flavoured fonts. I have
    seen much more bugs and problems in operating systems and Office apps related
    to PostScript-flavoured fonts. Which is not surprising, since TrueType/OpenType
    TT is just the common format here. \r\nIt's only in design apps (like those from
    Adobe) where PostScript-flavored fonts are much more common and therefore better
    tested. "

    made a big splash because of their native Postscript support; Windows required
    ATM for PS Type 1 fonts until Windows 2000/NT4. However, Apple\u2019s implementation
    was less than elegant, with its screen-fonts-and-printer-fonts approach.\r\n\r\n
    Apple and Microsoft developed TrueType more or less together in order to bust
    the Adobe monopoly. Adobe responded by actively dissing the TrueType format, which\u2014in
    my experience\u2014a lot of Mac users thought was a Windoze-only product.\r\n\r\nNow,
    Apple appears to content to sever entirely its relationship with the company that
    helped build Apple. Not only is Flash not supported on Mac portable devices, but
    also I have read that the latest release of OS X doesn't support PS Type 1 fonts
    any more. I suppose that, if you\u2019re going to burn bridges, you should do
    a thorough job\u2026"
