    form... I'd think Inigo would use the Usted form: \"Ud. mat\xF3 a mi padre...prep\xE1rese
    a morir!\" (\xA1Corr\xEDjame si no soy correcto!)\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: In Shakespearean English, the familiar form "thou" is used not only for beloved
    friends and family but also to talk down to someone the speaker holds in contempt.
    I would think it's the same in Spanish, isn't it?

  body: "I'm not so sure about that, cerulean... \"Usted\" is formal, and used for
    speaking with strangers. \"T\xFA\" is a familiar form used to speak with family
    and friends. If I'm not mistaken, French also has two forms of addressing another
    person."

    much less common than the french vous.\r\nMost South American friends that I have
    seem to use Vos, or something similar.\r\nIt could really go either way, the usted/tu
    thing isnt very strict."

    with my kids a couple of months ago and they loved every bit of it. It is a true

    it <em>is</em> very strict: \"tu\" is familiar and \"vous\" is formal. I wouldn't
    know about Spanish."
