body: "I don't enter competitions, but I do look at the calls for entries, because
  it's always interesting to see how they break things down.\r\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.dx.org/dxa/index.html\">Design
  Exchange Awards 2006</a> typeface design would best fit under \"Engineering\". Of
  course, \"Visual Communication\" would seem to be the obvious choice, but they break
  it down into two halves, \"Brand\" (aaaagh!) and \"Content\". I s'pose that a commissioned
  typeface would be considered part of the client's brand, and a retail typeface part
  of the foundry's brand, but as it says in most EULAs, \"fonts are software\", and
  gosh, I even feel like a bit of a software engineer these days as I'm doing all
  my clever OpenType feature coding. \r\n\r\nBesides, I don't really have a foundry
  brand that is supported by the types I design; like most foundries, mine does an
  eclectic mix of faces. But there are quite a few foundries where the foundry brand
  and its types reinforce brand in more than a general sense. Virus, with Jon Barnbrook's
  taste for jagged ornament. H&FJ's traditionalism. TypeCo. And the ultimate synergy

  body: "I'm almost never able to find an appropriate match in lists of professions
    or categories for what I produce. Even when a company like Adobe invites me to
    register as a beta tester, I scan the occupation list in vain looking for 'type
    designer'. When given the choice between something like 'graphic designer' or
    'software developer', I always select 'software developer'.\r\n\r\nRecently, I
    joined the Slow Food organisation, and they have a really delightful and very
    Italian list of occupations from which to choose. I particularly like the mixture
    of the generic and the precise, and the near synonyms suggesting that what matters
    is how you think of yourself:\r\n\r\nArtist\r\nArtisan\r\nCelebrity / Luminary\r\nCivil
    Servant\r\nCook / Chef\r\nEmployee\r\nEntrepreneur\r\nFarmer\r\nFisherman\r\nFreelancer\r\nHousewife\r\nInnkeeper
    / Hotelier\r\nJournalist\r\nLecturer / Teacher\r\nManager / Director\r\nMerchant\r\nPensioner\r\nRepresentative\r\nStudent\r\nUndefined\r\nVarious\r\nWinegrower
    / Winemaker\r\nWorker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
