    body copy in the book. '

    or lowercase.

  body: "The scale that Ricardo linked to is a precise measuring device, there is
    very little chance you could print it out accurately enough to be useable, software
    and printer would combine to foil you. The idea is that you can measure the cap
    (with the E) or x-height (with the x), however since typefaces vary in the amount
    of body they use it is not precise for all typefaces so once you have the approximate
    point size you can recreate the settings for measure and leading (which the scale
    will measure accurately) and finesse your point size by trial and error. You can
    also do that for free (although it takes time), to do this you need to precisely
    identify the typeface in both cases.\r\n\r\nTim"

    that a bit. That kind of scale is usually printed on clear acetate, so that you
    can place it on top of the book page (or other printed piece) and compare the
    book's type with the letters printed on the scale, until you find the closest
    match.\r\n\r\nYou can still find these scales at good art supply stores -- I've
    seen them at <a href=\"http://www.aifriedman.com/\">A.I. Friedman</a>. (In the
    old days, you could get them from your friendly neighborhood typesetting office.)"
