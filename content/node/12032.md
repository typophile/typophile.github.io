  (MAC Rhino Fonts)</a> was established in 2003, but founder [[Stefan Hattenbach]]
  has been producing fonts since 1997. The [[foundry]] operates as an independent
  studio, collaborating with its partners in various disciplines whenever necessary.\r\n\r\nMRF
  has accelerated its type design efforts since 2004. This will continue, along with
  advertising and graphic design work. In most cases, their typefaces are available
  from a variety of quality vendors: [[Fountain Type Foundry]], [[PsyOps Type Foundry]],
  and [[Veer]]. In the future, a unique collection of typefaces will be available
  exclusively through MRF.\r\n\r\nMRF also specializes in custom type design. They
  can customize existing designs or create original typefaces for a variety of uses,
  such as corporate branding."
