body: "The question of how to convert pfb font files to a format that can be used
  on the Mac was raised in two recent threads, one <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/37469\">with
  FortForge</a>, another one <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/37555\">with FontLab</a>.\r\n\r\nWith
  FontLab, that looks quite easy. With FontForge, for those that are not Unix Shell
  or Python literate, that may be tricky. I thus wrote a small Mac application <strong>pfb2otf</strong>
  that you can download by clicking <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/pfb2otf.zip\"><strong>here</strong></a>
  and that makes it easy too: you double click the icon of <strong>pfb2otf</strong>,
  select the folder containing the afm and pfb files of the fonts to convert, and
  that is it. If the afm file is not there, you lose  kerning.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nNow
  for Mac programmers: if you have a look at the script <code>pfb2otf.app/Contents/MacOS/pfbtootf</code>
  that does everything (in 70 lines or so), could you tell me what would have been
  the proper way to pass information from Applescript to the Unix shell? I fudged
  something using temporary files. Is there a good reference on this? Moreover, to
  show what is being done during processing, I display in a Finder window the otf
  files that are being generated; sometimes the displayed size is Zero KB, whilst
  the file is definitely not empty as we see when we check with File Info. Where is
  the bug?\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\nMay 13 2009: link to pfb2otf modified following <a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/node/37659#comment-346516\">this post</a>.\r\nMay 13
  2009: pfb2otf now returns an error if X11 is not installed.\r\nMay 14 2009: And
  here is <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/pfb2otfpy\"><strong>pfb2otfpy</strong></a>,
  that does not require X11, and can also read data from pfm files.\r\nFeb 02 2010
  <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/pfb2otf.zip\"><strong>pfb2otf</strong></a>,
  that does not use the Python library but requires X11, also reads data from .pfm
  files when they are in the same folder as the .pfb files.\r\nDec 27 2011.  The message
  for <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/pfb2otf.zip\"><strong>pfb2otf</strong></a>
  was changed to <em>\"Enter the folder with the font files to convert (listed in
  grey)\"</em>; you must indeed enter the folder containing the fonts to convert before
  clicking on <strong>Choose</strong> (tested on OS X 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7 with the
  <a href=\"http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=fontforge\">MacPorts
  FontForge</a>)."

    is to change view mode of the finder window to icon view and back to details.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m

    language, old fashioned Bourne shell and called osascript when needed, trying
    to depend on as few resources as possible. That means  a 70 line script file,
    plus the file Info.plist (40 lines of text), plus an icon which is the big part,
    40312 bytes. "

    And it takes time before getting a running version; I have a macport installation
    on my MacBook Pro and I know. If the aim is only to use pfb2otf, the installer
    is fast and the version of pfb2otf that uses a fontforge script is quite stable.
    It runs in less than a minute or so if X11 is already installed (I just tested
    again on my MacBook pro and fontforge requires /usr/X11/lib/libXi.6.dylib to run
    in batch mode; can you tell me why?). The fontforge python libraries  also come
    with the installer. The problem is that the version of python that is to be used
    changes with time and with the OS. With OS X 10.5 and OS X 10.6, fontforge now
    expects python2.5 (and on my mini with 10.6, /usr/bin/python is /usr/bin/python2.6).
    With OS X 10.4, it uses python2.3; pfb2otfpy thus requires some maintenance (and
    I do it only when someone asks), pfb2otf is quite happy with old or new versions
    of fontforge; it requires no change and is quite happy with the installer.\r\n\r\nMichel"
