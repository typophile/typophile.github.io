  body: "Taking the large apertures in account, I think FT Albert could also be classified
    as a rounded humanist sans serif. Also, its interrupted construction is more common
    to the humanist sans serif as to the modern sans. Compare the join of the horizontal
    curved stroke of \u2018n\u2019 in Syntax, a typical humanist sans, with Univers,
    a typical modern sans / neo-grotesque."

    body: "Not sure I would classify it as rounded.\r\n\r\nHumanist is an interesting
      call. However, do you think the lack of calligraphic contrast in the strokes
      takes it out of that class?"

  body: "I do not think that \u2018calligraphic contrast\u2019 should be regarded
    as unique to the humanist sans. Gill Sans would not fit into that class anymore
    when \u2018calligraphic contrast\u2019 becomes a must. That would be a strange
    idea, after all, the existence of Gill Sans (and Johnston) and was the main reason
    why the Brits came up with Humanist Sans at all. People like Johnston and Gill
    were the ones that practically re-introduced broad nib handwriting to Great Britain
    again. No wonder that they followed the broad nib model when they designed their
    sans serif typefaces.\r\nI think the idea of including typefaces with \u2018calligraphic
    contrast\u2019 was launched to be able to include typefaces like Optima or even
    Pascal. Which makes sense when you desperately want to take in these typefaces
    in a main Vox class, but a bad idea when you look at typefaces like Britannic.
    That is rather a Grotesque or Neo-Grotesque with higher contrast. Either one should
    allow sans serif with higher contrast in all sans serif classes or give them a
    descriptor of their own. And then allow to couple that descriptor with all sans
    serif classes. Just as one can combine \u2018rounded\u2019 with all classes. By
    the way, the contrast of Britannic is a as \u2018calligraphic\u2019 as Optima.
    It is just another calligraphic pen which determines its contrast. Calligraphy
    and calligraphic contrast are not exclusive to the broad nib. When you look at
    18th and 19th century calligraphy (Baskerville, Snell, Champion, Bickham etc.),
    you\u2019ll notice that in those days, the flexible pointed nib \u2018ruled the
    waves\u2019. Take off the serifs from Bodoni and you\u2019ll almost end up with
    Britannic ;\u2013)\r\nConsidering Round and Rounded: I think true round sans serifs
    should be called Round (\u2026) Sans Serif, whereas those with rounded corners
    should be called Rounded (\u2026) Sans Serif. Until someone comes up with a better
    proposal of course :\u2013)"
