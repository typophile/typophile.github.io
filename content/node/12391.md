  body: If you are not particularly attached to your current browser, you might consider
    switching to Opera 8.0, which has a pretty good built-in RSS reader.

  body: The RSS feeds do indeed work, but only the initial post in any thread is included.
    Until "comments" (posts after the first) are included in the RSS they aren't a
    substitute for the email notification of the old Typophile. But I'm confident
    they will be included.

  body: "I am using a Mac with OS 9.2, and apparently RSS readers for that configuration
    are poor if they exist. I found that there are online RSS readers that let you
    be independent of your platform. I just started using <a href=\"http://www.bloglines.com\">Bloglines</a>
    and it seems to work fine. \r\n\r\nI have to say I also miss having the notifications
    when something new happens at the Type ID Board. :(\r\n\r\nAlthough Stephen's
    comment gives me hope."

  body: "RSS ain't workin', and not just because only getting the initial post in
    a thread is hopelessly inadequate. I configured RSS in my Thunderbird (on WinXP-Home)
    but when I first fired it up I got 15 entries (no idea how/why/which), and since
    then... nothing.\r\n\r\nUnless email is brought back, or RSS works for real, yours
    truly for one will remain pretty much a headless chicken here, because the overhead
    in scanning the \"tracker\" takes too much time/energy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I might have missed something already discussed in another thread since I
    have been on vacation, but I got the feeling that I only get 5% of the discussions
    when I use an RSS reader (no matter if it is Thunderbird or RSSOwl, both recommended
    RSS readers). I haven't found a descent way to read the discussions on the web,
    to check the end of each thread each day and try to remember what one have read
    and not read is not very convenient.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations on how to read
    the forums?\r\n\r\n/m\xE5rten\r\n"

  body: Well, my comment went all ascii on me. Basically the best thing to do is use
    the tracker, specifically to track your threads. Very convenient actually. Now
    I don't have to have my e-mail set to check every 5 minutes! :^P

  body: "The problem is that the \"main\" feed (http://www.typophile.com/rss) is not
    working properly. I have subscribed to the specific feeds (links <a href=\"http://typophile.com/feeds\">here</a>)
    and these are working fine (except for the Critique: Blackletter feed).\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\n\r\nThis is what I've been doing to read the forums:\r\nFirst thing: log
    in to Typophile. Then, on <a href=\"http://www.feedreader.com/\">FeedReader</a>,
    I read the new threads from the forums I've subscribed to; and also the replies
    to them (by clicking on the permalinks at the bottom of the message).\r\n\r\nAfter
    checking out the new threads with the RSS reader, I use the tracker to look for
    new posts to old threads. The tracker shows me which threads have new posts (must
    be logged in to work)."

  body: "Here's an efficient way to catch up for people in Headless Chicken Mode like
    me:\r\n1) Write down the day/time.\r\n2) Starting with the Forum/General-Discussions
    section:\r\n2a) sort by Last Reply (reverse chronologically);\r\n2b) find the
    break at the beginning of May (right now on page 3 for G-D);\r\n2c) open each
    thread in a new window, skim or peruse, reply as needed;\r\n2d) when you get to
    the day/time you started, stop.\r\n3) Repeat step 2, skipping sections you don't
    want.\r\n4) Go to the Tracker, and check out the new threads since you started.\r\n\r\nI
    caught up with the whole of the General-Discussions section in under an hour (including
    making 6 posts). The only problem is that the Tracker doesn't show which section
    a post is in (in case you want to skip any).\r\n\r\nThis is better than using
    only the Tracker for the whole catch-up process, because that requires going through
    23 pages, and remembering what threads you've already looked at throughout the
    process.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBut still, guys:\r\nRelying on the Tracker for \"real-time\"
    catch-ups is so... 2004.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
