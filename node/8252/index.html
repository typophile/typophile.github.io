<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>It is a grey and dreary day and, geek that I am, I've been rereading Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style. In the Glossary of Typographic Terms he defines Humanist as: <br>Humanist letterforms originating among the humanists of the Italian Renaissance and persisting to the present day. They are of two primary kinds: roman and italic, both of which derive from Roman capitals and Carolingian minuscules. Humanist letterforms show <b>the clear trace of a broadnib pen held by a right-handed scribe</b>. They have a <i>modulated</i> stroke and a <i>humanist axis</i> <br>As a lefty I find writing by hand incredibly difficult and gave up on calligraphy years ago. (I remember reading an interview in Graphis where the designer said left handed people with an interest in letters design fonts, right handed people become calligraphers) I'm wondering, are there left-handed humanist faces, where the stroke modulates but the axis is mirrored? What would some examples be?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Although they'll never admit it, many partisans of chirographic fonts don't think much of left-handers; they see that differentiation as an inconvenience at best. Some of them even invent ludicrous ideas of how left-handers should write simply to justify their personal regressive dogma. <br> <br>BTW, funny thing about the proportion of left-handers: 15% is low enough that it fosters discrimination, but not so low that that discrimination doesn't become seriously unjust for everybody in the end. <br> <br>So basically left-hand-ductus fonts would be seen as perverted by most chirographers, and as something merely curious by the rest. Just so you know. I personally would love to see it though, since it would actually reinforce my stance (and it would simply be interesting). I could even put you in touch with a couple of accomplished left-handed calligraphers. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Noah, there are a number of challenges facing lefties when it comes to writing, some practical and some cultural. Practically, you have the problem that most writing tools work best when pulled, rather than pushed, which means, for someone working with a left-to-right script, one needs to start on the right edge of most letters. This means, of course, that you need to be a very good judge of the proportions of letters. This isn't by any means an insurmountable challenge, indeed, this, reversed, is the normal way of writing Hebrew: a right-to-left script usually written starting at the left side of the letter. Arabic writers tend to push the pen much more frequently than either Latin or Hebrew writers -- hence the prevelance of the flexible reed pen in Arabic calligraphy --, but they also tend to rotate the page, writing from top to bottom, as seen in the short film at the <a href=http://www.arabictypography.com/flash.html>Arabic Typography</a> website (click on the dark square moving across the screen to see the movie; other squares take you to different content). <br> <br>The cultural challenges are more difficult. In my talk at ATypI in Prague, I discussed the role of ductus in letter identity, and as an illustration wrote the Latin letter <i>a</i> with the typical ducti of three different scripts that have assumed their most common forms written with broad writing instruments: Latin, Hebrew and Devanagari. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56243.gif alt="Getting one's ducti in a row..."> <br> <br>[By the way, I usually write Hebrew letters with what are sold by calligraphy suppliers as lefty nibs: they're not perfect for the task -- they should be cut on even more of an angle -- but they are more convenient than reed pens for quick jottings.] <br> <br>The red line indicates that, structurally, the three letters are almost identical -- so far as the tool will permit --, which is why I don't think a purely structural understanding of letter identity is <i>sufficient.</i> Ductus is part of our conventional identification of letters, and as such is culturally conservative. <br> <br>The good news is that ductus is not a fixed thing in most scripts, and certainly not in the Latin script. Over the centuries, a wide variety of ducti have been accepted by readers, although almost always as a result of changes in writing implement. The most dramatic evolution in the accepted ductus of the Latin script accompanied the introduction of the split, spencerian nib. <br> <br>Other scripts have embraced not only different ducti in different styles of lettering, but also varying ducti within a style. The illustration below, also from my Prague talk, shows the range of ducti in the Byzantine Greek style. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56244.gif alt="The influence of ouzo on ductus..."> <br> <br> <br>In my experience of trying to write Latin letters with atypical ducti, I found that it is actually very difficult. Perhaps it will be easier for you, as a lefty? What I found was not simply that the axis of contrast is reversed but that the angle makes it awkward to render the normal structure of the letters (see the dip in the bold of 'Devanagari' <i>a</i>). What you will find -- and I encourage you to try it -- is that attempting to render humanist letterforms with a lefty ductus will produce wild and wonderful results, but they won't look like traditional humanist letters. Why not? Because the identity of the latter is not merely structural but determined by their ductus. Also, you will have a much easier time with a narrower nib than I used: I was going to high contrast to make a point.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I almost never use the term 'proof' outside of the context of logic or mathematics. But I do, as you know, ask for evidence. In contrasting an understanding of letter identity that <i>includes</i> ductus with a commonly held structural, or skeletal, understanding, I refer to the illustration below. A purely structural understanding of letter identity cannot explain why the shape on the right falls outside the range of our conventional identification of a letter A. Note that I am not claiming that the shape is unidentifiable as an A, and certainly not that it could be confused for any other letter, only that it does not belong in the conventionally determined set of forms that, taken together, constitute the identity of that letter. If you remember the discussion of letter identity on the ATypI list a few months ago, I avoid a Platonist notion of letter identity -- I don't think there is any ideal, abstract letter A of which all letter A's are imperfect shadows. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56247.gif alt="Letters are things, not ducks..."></div>

<div class=commentbody>Duct <br>4. A stroke drawn or traced, or the manner of tracing it (cf. L. <i>ductus litterarum</i>). <br> <br>Interesting. <br> <br>I am aware of the difficulties in the left to right Latin alphabet. The easiest way to see it is take a pen and paper and draw an arrow, people draw away from the body, a right handed person tends to draw left to right, a lefty, right to left. I actually mirror write sometimes. <br> <br>My handwriting is terrible. The way handwriting is taught in the American school system is bad in general and terrible for lefties. This is probably why I fell in love with fonts. Thoughts deserve to be presented in an attractive format conducive to comprehension, type gives me this ability. <br> <br>However, I'd be very interesting in trying to draw humanist letterforms with a lefty ductus but I don't know where to start. Are there any good online or cheap guides I could look at?</div>

<div class=commentbody>How close is your nearest library? Most decent calligraphy books will show you typical letterform construction -- using numbered strokes -- for a variety of scripts. Italic humanist hand tends to be demonstrated more often than the upright, although the common 'foundational' hand shown as an introductory script in most books is quite similar. The single best calligraphy book I've ever found is Claude Mediavilla's <i>Calligraphy,</i> which does show the upright humanist script (and much else besides). There are French and English language editions; hopefully you can find a library that has one or the other.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, you ask for formal proof from me every chance you get, come on. <br>Just a couple of weeks ago was your most explicit application of Escape Clause #2*: <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53822.html target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53822.html</a> <br>"until you can actually demonstrate a statistically significant increase in reading speed and accuracy, all your talk about readability and anti-readability in type design doesn't convince me." <br> <br>* With #1 being that Familiarity makes this all moot anyway. <br> <br>Your beliefs about the importance of right-hand-broad-nib-pen ductus to reading have the same amount of proof -and even less evidence- than my beliefs about boumas. In that light: <br>1) I would ask that you please stop asking for Proof from me every time we disagree. <br>2) Allow me -and others who have the fortune of being unencumbered by an unhealthy infatuation with a certain human body part- to believe what simply makes sense: that <i>stroke contrast</i> is indeed helpful, but the sort you describe and defend is an arbitrary and circumstantial subset of that. Another thing that makes sense is this: that the separation of structure and ductus is artificial. Structure is a chimera used by chirographers to justify their dogma; and it goes against notan. <br> <br>In the case of your righthand "A", I would say that: <br>1) You simply don't <i>know</i> that it falls outside of anything. Which doesn't mean I would insist on Proof. But I do insist on an adequate elaboration of sound reasoning. I've never heard anything even close. <br>2) I would much rather compare two "A"s where one has the conventional stroke contrast while the other has two symmetrical strokes that taper thin towards the top, and have a thin bar. I have reason to believe that the latter form would actually be "better", arguably both functionally and aesthetically (although of course the latter is highly subjective, even though JF for one has pointed out that conventional ductus unsettles some laymen at display sizes). <br> <br>BTW, Mediavilla's book is indeed amazing. I bought a copy of the French original from the IN library some years ago, although I've yet to <i>really</i> read it. Another very good acquisition here would be Vance Studley's "Left-Handed Calligraphy" - yet another book I've bought with no idea when I'll manage to read it... <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't see any inconsistency in the two concepts. Ductus works on the level of individual glyphs while boumas (as I understand it) are word forms. Unless I'm misinterpreting you, Hrant, your idea is that the variation among letters when combined into words creates recognizable forms on a macro level. Clearly then, familiarity with individual letter forms would enhance familiarity with word forms. Ductus, then, is hardly incompatible with boumas. Unless I'm missing something (always a possibility, I do English lit. and Analytical Philosophy and while I've studied design I'm a novice when it comes to typography)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wasn't trying to say that ductus and boumas are in conflict*, I was trying to expose a flaw in John's overall argumentation. One day he says readability doesn't matter, another day he worries about the functional difference between similar Hebrew glyphs by relying on obtuse linguistic frequency differences; one day he wants a multi-million-dollar scientific study from me, another day he makes broad, educated claims a lot like I [try to] do! So about half the time I think he's doing great (which might in fact be more than I typically manage). <br> <br>* On the other hand, ductus is very much in conflict with notan, since it enforces a relationship within the Black that precludes an optimal relationship between the Black and White. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, asking you to demonstrate something is not asking for 'formal proof'. Do you even know what the term formal proof means? It refers to a proof in formal logic. <br> <br>You are totally misrepresting everything I have written in this thread by suggesting I believe anything about the 'importance of right-hand-broad-nib-pen ductus to reading'. I never once said that any particular ductus was important to reading. I never mentioned reading at all. <br> <br>What I have said is that ductus is <i>part</i> of how we <i>conventionally</i> identify letterforms. And also said that ductus changes over time and may vary within a script. I'm surprised you find anything in this to disagree with. Our alphabets were not invented ex nihilo as abstract systems: they were invented by making marks on surfaces with tools. And they all carry the artifacts of this invention. <br> <br>I've offered some illustrations to show my thinking in this area and, as I said in Prague, I am only as far as acknowledging that ductus makes the structuralist identification of letterforms problematic. The question of <i>how</i> something so flexible as ductus contributes to letter identity is more difficult. <br> <br>If you read what I write with more care and less prejudice, you'd see the very obvious fact that I agree that the structuralist understanding of letterform is anti-notan. That is one of the reasons I think it is insufficient to understanding letter identity. <br> <br>You seem, today, intent not only on insulting me, but also of systematically misrepresenting everything I have written in this thread in the most bizarre way. Noah was asking about a very particular style of <i>writing</i> -- the humanist hand -- and wondering if it could be written with a different ductus. My answer is that if he tries what he will get will not be the humanist hand, because the ductus is part of what makes that style what it is. I never implied for one moment that there would be anything inherently wrong with the letters that he would produce in this way, and was very clear that the acceptance or unacceptance of them is culturally conventional. <br> <br>Once again, Hrant, for someone who goes on at such length about reading, your comprehension skills suck <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>One day he says readability doesn't matter, another day he worries about the functional difference between similar Hebrew glyphs by relying on obtuse linguistic frequency differences...</i> <br> <br>That's not readability: that's legibility <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> My you've come back from your trip in a combatative mood! <br> <br> <br>Thinking about this thread some more, it strikes me that talking about ductus <i>per se</i> in the context of letter identity is potentially misleading. It happens, as I mention, that our writing systems originated as marks of an surface with a tool, and ductus is simply the visible artifact of that. So I've been speaking about ductus because I've been speaking about the historical development of scripts (and because Noah asked about a specific historical style, with a particular ductus resulting from a particular tool). But it may help you to understand that we're at least partly on the same wavelength if, instead, I talk about <i>notan</i> in the context of letter identity. As the discussion on the ATypI list showed, people do tend to think about letter identity in structuralist or abstract, Platonist terms. You and I both disagree with this -- if I have understood you correctly --, and agree that letter identity involves the total image of the letter. As it happens, that image, in the historical development of our writing systems, is almost always determined by one kind of ductus or another. The particular ductus is part of the definition of specific historical styles. So when I'm talking about history, I'm going to talk about ductus. I think the role of ductus in contemporary type design is something we should all be thinking about critically.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm reading the <i>resultant meaning</i> of what you say, not just the words. <br>Am I reading them wrong, or are you perhaps unaware of the full implications? <br> <br>-- <br> <br>I don't get how what you wrote doesn't lead to a "positivism" towards [conventional] ductus - that being the main thing I was opposing. And I also don't get how "identifying letterforms" isn't [part of] reading. Your second "A" for example is perfectly legible, which to me is a boring issue though. More interesting is why/how does it go against immersive reading? This is not clear to me at all, especially in light of my belief that information comes from contrast (so for example having an "A" and an "M" with different ductus might actually be good). Also, the typical arguments used by chirographers in defending the <i>functionality</i> of their ideology are all hot air. When cornered they deploy Escape Clause #1 more expertly than the most accomplished PoMo hooligans! <br> <br>So exactly what use does ductus have besides pleasing chirographers? <br> <br>> people do tend to think about letter identity in structuralist or abstract, Platonist terms. <br> <br>Sure, but the issue in terms of <i>readability</i> is what does the "subconscious" <i>need</i>. I realize you alluded to this too, but it seems you resist admitting the essential flaw in chirography. You talk about notan, but then you say hey, designers are pragmatists who use whatever "tools" work. I don't expect any person to follow his beliefs 100%, but at least we need to admit when we stray. And how do we choose the right tools, and why even bother, if the gain is only a form of professional play? <br> <br>Then there's the issue of the conscious realm - display type. Like when people think of an "A" as being laterally symmetrical, isn't there something wrong with the conventional ductus? <br> <br>> These are measurable things <br> <br>But just because I'm not in a position to measure things it doesn't mean I shouldn't apply what I believe. If I think a certain form of lc "d" is best, I'm not going to let the Ghost of Ductus scare me away from it. <br> <br>hhp</div>

But as in the ATypI list discussion, I'm actually thinking about letter identity itself: not the act of identifying a letter A, for example, but what makes a letter A a letter A. <br> <br>So we're talking past each other a bit here, because you're intepreting this discussion as part of our long conversation about readability, while I am not. I'm sorry if my careless use of the verb 'identification' encouraged this confusion. <br> <br> <br><i>But just because I'm not in a position to measure things it doesn't mean I shouldn't apply what I believe. If I think a certain form of lc "d" is best, I'm not going to let the Ghost of Ductus scare me away from it.</i> <br> <br>Nor should you. What I object to is that you not only determine that a particular form of lowercase <i>d</i> is best, but then insult everyone who disagrees with you. I wouldn't so frequently point out that your beliefs are based on untested theories if you were not so quick to use those theories as a bludgeon. As you must have gathered by now, I actually agree with some of your ideas. It's your attitude to people that I don't like, including your construction of this fantastic camp of ideologically chirographic artistes. When I point out that most type designers are pragmatists, I mean that they are not ideologues.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Noah, I have read that left-handers (I am one) can do conventional letter forms in calligraphy by either slanting the paper or by a device that clips the pen at an angle, so you can hold it comfortably, and still have the tip at a usual right hand angle. I haven't tried these, though. <br>Doyald Young, who shows fabulous script logos in his Fonts & Logos, says he is left handed. However, for all his logos he draws (builds up) his letters with a sharp pencil, rather than writing them with a broad nibbed pen. <br> <br>On the issue of the influence of the writing instrument on letter form, van Krimpen and Morrison had this same argument in the '30s, with Morrison on the side of irrelevance. Van Krimpen's view was not that the pen dictated type letter form, but rather that there was a basis or influence of the pen on letter form. (I don't have the book or quote now).</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Who could actually show some left hand calligraphy? <br> <br>You mean, who can show a lefthander's calligraphy, right? I have just finished a semester with a class in which three lefthanders made varying progress; all advanced considerably. Of the three, one is on the way to a very good Italic, and with the others, an Antiqua and blackletter (a simplified or early Textura) of some accomplishment. <br> <br>It is not impossible for the standard shapes of the letters to be formed well by lefthanders. It is equally not possible for all righthanders to form the letters well; as with the lefthander, some skill and, dare-to-say, talent (a combination of sight, judgement, kinesthetics, control, allowance for the tool and materials, and more; desire and an unprejudiced mind, and a pleasure in the making) are necessary. <br> <br>Noah asked about the (Humanist) ductus -- to me, that is the path and order of the stroke, primarily. Pen-angle or bias is secondary. In John's lovely example, the a's paths are identical; the bias of the tool is different. To truly have a different ductus, the 'a' would need to have a different structure. <br>For example, the 'a' of blackletter is angular; the turns are quicker and tighter; the course of the tool, more direct and straighter. In Antiqua, the paths are made rounder and softer; the turns, slower and more open. <br>Each share (save the hairline that often closes the upper bowl of the two-storey blackletter 'a') an underlying structure of an arcade and a lower-left bowl, but the shape of the path along which the tool is con-ducted (from L. ducere, to lead) varies enough that we see them as very different styles. This is enough to distinguish the ducti of the two hands. <br>A radically different ductus for a might be more like that of the Egyptian heiratic A (the sign for the bird, kite) where the path is singular, made with no lifting of the tool from the surface. The belly of the bird is the bowl of 'a'; the beak and head make the arcade. The terminating tail is the spur at the lower left of 'a'. The effect is that of an 'a' with an opening at the right side of the bowl. You will see this ocassionally in some handwriting; the effect is an affectation, but tolerable. <br> <br>For the lefthander who is frustrated by the edged pen, there is the flexible pen, used for copperplate engravers' script. Quite a market, if done well. As the pen angle is reversed in most strokes from that in edged pen work, and thush tending heavy from upper right to lower left, it is more difficult for a righthander to make; the pen or paper must be held in reverse, or with the nib in a special canted holder. Conversely, a lefthander is naturally positioned to move the pen (always towards, never away, as the sharp nib will bite in) easily and without strain. <br> <br>if I have a chance, I will find texts by the LH calligraphers, but semester is over and students do wander off to home. <br> <br>Solsticial greetings to all, <br> <br>G.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hector, <br>There was a book, several years ago, that addressed this issue; one of Margaret Shepherd's series, I believe. A series of hands used the reversed (rotated would be a more accurate description) pen angle, as I recall. The reversed stress effect is, to my taste, not altogether pleasant; it is as if the sun had risen in the west (-: <br> <br>The Latin script doesn't adapt well to the reversed placement of stress; counters close up, terminals become heavy and thick, and serifs are as prominent than stems. <br> <br>As close as one might find to a reversed axis hand are the Rustic and Beneventian or, more contemporarily, the draftsman's hand, as codified in Tekton etc. by Siegel. For famous lefthanders, there's Leonardo da Vinci; though his writing is simply mirrored, and definitely handwriting not calligraphy (that is, it does not aspire to a particular beauty in execution of the writing and in effect on reading by any other than the writer). It is somewhat germane in that he used a lefthander's natural angle for his edged pen. There is an exotic beauty to a page of his, of course. <br> <br>You will notice in John's example too the Devanagari, which requires this reversed angle for much of its effect; look instead for examples of this script. Or copperplate; it is quite lovely and as I wrote before a natural fit to the lefthander's peculiar situation. <br> <br>Then, there are hands such as Insular half uncial that use a flatter pen angle and a rounder ductus; these are somewhat simpler for a lefthander to accomplish, as well as for righthanders. World-wise, there are the Ethiopic syllabary, Armenian, Coptic (I'm sure there's one or two missing here) that also use a flat angle (oh; Slavonic etc.) with very strong verticals -- rather Bodoni, eh? -- that lefthanders might try. Or a different tool, such as a brush or flexible nib. There are options and stretegies for most any condition that allow a route to making letters by hand, and making them well. There is, though, no Royal Road; not for lefthanders or for righthanders. Hey; use Illustrator and apply an angled brush. It's a Princely Path.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> The Latin script doesn't adapt well to the reversed placement of stress <br> <br>That makes sense. On the other hand if the contrast is low (like in Bloemsma's stuff) it can come out quite unique and still usable. For one thing reverse-contrast Latin fonts are great -if somewhat subordinate- companions to Semitic scripts. <br> <br>> though his writing is simply mirrored <br> <br>I thought it was boustrophedon. <br> <br>> definitely handwriting not calligraphy <br> <br>This distinction is useful and relevant, but I'm not sure the positive pole of "beauty" is a good way of looking at it. To me calligraphy can be ugly too (or naive, or really anything else), as long as it's intentional - so I'd rather put the distinction on "aesthetically aware" instead of beautiful (which is highly subjective). <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Boustrophedon is "as the ox plows" right-to-left, left-to-right until the day's acre is done. Leonardo wrote right to left entirely, mirroring the right-hand world. <br> <br>Well, as a word, aesthetics has the same difficulty as beauty. Both need defining and referents to work at all. If in your eye (or in mine) a piece of writing is not pleasing or is ugly, then 'tain't calligraphy. At some point judgements is made. <br> <br>As to EB's works, I see a lot of reference in them to the traditions instituted by the centuries of Latin written with an edged pen. The shapes are subtly modulated but most often follow the stress distribution of edged pen shapes, the proportions are classic. <br> <br>On a sinister note: <br>The Times (that's the New York one) has a short article on lefties. Seems there are more of them in physically disputatious societies. Yep. Due to what they call "negative frequency-dependent selection," the element of surprise that lefthanders have over righties expecting offense or defense from opponents might give a selection benefit in survival. Article references baseball teams with high percentages of lefties, and statistical studies of societies still in traditional and non-Westernized (or Easternized) state. Low-violence societies had fewer lefties, higher, more. It's statistical, so: much saltiness. <br>--- NYT Science Times, 21 Dec 2004</div>

<div class=commentbody>> At some point judgements is made. <br> <br>No, two people don't have to agree that something is pleasing (which btw is not at all the same thing as beautiful) to simply note that the maker of that thing was concerned about its <i>form</i>, and to me that concern is what pulls calligraphy away from handwriting. Maybe I should have have said "formally aware", but by using "aesthetics" I was just trying to avoid a positive/negative valuation (and in one dimension, that of ugly/beautiful). <br> <br>Of course I can't force you to use my definition of "calligraphy", but I can point out that yours is practically deficient: there are examples of things that are not beautiful*, but they're also clearly not "just" handwriting - these don't seem to fit anywhere in your terminology. <br> <br>* Again noting the fatal subjectivity of this benchmark. <br> <br>> As to EB's works, I see a lot of reference in them to the traditions <br>> instituted by the centuries of Latin written with an edged pen. <br> <br>Yes, I know you do. I've tried but failed to help you with that problem. I'm not being fascetious or mean. I have failed in that. And blaming the limitations of ASCII would be an excuse. <br> <br>BTW, I read that story on the BBC site a week or so ago. It was pretty interesting (if also unsurprising). I'm not sure how it pertains to type, although I'm sure it does, somehow... Maybe it leads to the view that forcing lefthanders to create righthanded calligraphy creates the illusion of a craft at peace? Until the hermetic society is breached from the outside, of course... <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Beauty is a complex concept, the subject of a huge amount of philosophical literature. The word calligraphy, obviously, has an explicit etymological link to the beautiful, and the majority of calligraphy tends to involve a deliberate attempt to create something beautiful. Even challenging modern calligraphic works that use non-traditional forms that might be fractured, distressed or otherwise evoke a contemporary ugliness, tend to do so within formally constructed arrangements, and so fall well within the circumfrence of the aesthetic as considered by the philosophers. <br> <br>If we need to distinguish between handwriting and calligraphy, it must be as activities rather than as products, since there is nothing to prevent handwriting from being beautiful (I only wish mine were). I believe the distinction has to do with the intent of putting down a text entirely for the sake of its content (handwriting), and putting down a text in a manner that gives prominence to its form and arrangement. It isn't actually necessary for anyone to agree on whether a particular thing is beautiful for its consideration to fall within the realm of aesthetics. Beauty is not one thing, but many things, and appreciation of different modes of beauty is both cultural and individual, and develops as we are exposed to and assimilate new experiences of the beatiful.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>John, <br>The complexity of the philosophical implications of meanings of beauty is one reason I'd rather not go into it; perhaps at typotechnica. <br>I agree that there are differences in the purpose of the text that affect its perception -- as with Leonardo, to record; or, as with Zapf, to present -- which differences seem to fall at their most extreme at four quadrants, controlled by the interactions of several polarities : personal/interpersonal and attention/disregard; attention to text, detail, and overall design, or disregard of the same. In those quadrants there's an infinite field through which a rendering of a text might pass and indeed be found beautiful, or ugly, or valuable, or worthless by a viewer or a culture. <br> <br>Your mention of calligraphic is important, as there is much work that is non-textual, but that might be considered to partake of some of the qualities that make calligraphy (and there are many, most of which I've yet to fully master: ars longa) worthy of being considered beautiful. <br> <br>Hrant, <br>Unfortunately I also have failed to convince you of the value of knowing the cause of much of shapings that make up the letters we deal with in type. Without that understanding I fear that wheels will be reinvented, or worse, simply imitated, should there be not a base for asking truly pertinent questions about the sources of letter features. <br>It is not good, generally, to take anything for granted. If the maker would work against a thing, then the maker would best know something about that thing. How best to achieve an effect, how best to avoid an effect? What has gone before, and how did that all work out? Why did it work then, but not now, in this medium? <br>Assimilate the lessons of the pen and then move on beyond; let the pen-made shape inform the work, using judgement to choose the best shape for the work; reject, adapt, or accept? These are design decisions that must be available to anyone working in letters. These all will ground the work in solid foundations or create an airy fantasy, each fit to its purpose. <br> <br>As you know, I don't at all advocate strictly edged-pen-like type; the pen is, like a computer, another tool for making. But the things I make -- letters -- happen to have a long history, both calligraphic and typographic; that history is something worth the time spent investigating and considering when making them. <br> <br>have a lovely,</div>
