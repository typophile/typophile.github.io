  day card within the image from the site <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/02/print-out-valentines-day-cards-from-tracy-jordan-roger-sterling-and-more.html\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
  card I'm talking about has the words \"You are literally my favorite person ever!\"
  and \"Chris Traeger\" on it. \r\n\r\nJust in case I haven't been clear enough, I've
  attached the part of the image from the website that I would like to identify the
  fonts from. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."
