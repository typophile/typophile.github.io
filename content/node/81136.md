  look at the theatrical one-sheet art for this 80s Eddie Murphy comedy:\r\n\r\nhttp://img.mspot.com/icache/dimg3.php?df=blankimage&ft=jpg&f=images/vod/1535/box.jpg\r\n\r\nWhatever
  they used for the title treatment has me thoroughly stumped.  Can't get anything
  close to it.  Anyone recognize it?\r\n\r\nI think perhaps it's a composite of more
  than one face.   The D is clearly different (just look at the serifs) from the other
  letters, and the C and G feel a little too different from each other."

  body: That looks like custom lettering, especially given its age. I've seen lots
    of similar things in calligraphy and lettering books from that era but not in
    type books.

  body: It looks sooo similar to Trajan Bold that has been condensed to me. Some of
    the characters are almost exactly the same but then the N has a different top.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions.  None are very close though - strange.  It has
    a lot more character than something like Trajan but fills much the same role.
    \ No surprise then that it showed up on an old Hollywood poster. Maybe I could
    recreate this face, provided of course I could ID it and then find something to
    scan.  \r\n\r\nForgive my naivete, but does anyone on the board here know how
    the designers in the pre-digital age went about selecting faces for film titles
    on posters like this?  I know they pulled from books, but have never seen one
    myself.  Anyone know the titles of the books so I could start looking for them
    on ebay etc?"

  body: Most likely in this case they hired a lettering artist, who drew it from scratch.
    Just because something looks like it was a font doesn't mean it was a font. The
    further you go back, the more this is true.

    on ebay etc?<cite>\r\n\r\nThe Speedball manuals or the many volumes of Dover alphabets
    are a good place to start. I've found a lot of good books on eBay simply searching
    under \"lettering book\". Some mid-20th Century gems that are fairly common in
    the US include \"Modern Brush Lettering\" by Harold Holland Day and \"ABC of Lettering\"
    by Carl Holmes. Type specimens would be used as reference just as much as books
    of hand-lettered alphabets.\r\n\r\nHowever, an experienced lettering artist would
    probably draw a roman serif like this without the need for any reference material.
    To make a digital font from this logo it would be better to learn how to build
    the missing letters from the information in the ones you've got, which Leslie
    Carbarga explains in his \"Logo, Font and Lettering Bible\" and Bruce Willen &
    Nolen Strals cover in \"Lettering & Type\", rather than expect to find a complete
    alphabet to scan and trace. "
