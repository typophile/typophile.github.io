  of some oaky cabernet blend to make me forget that the headings on the menus were
  set in Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the oak flavor was from that delicious
  butter oak that the French don\u2019t sell to California."

    the menu headings were set in Comic Sans I laughed myself silly. I laughed at
    the absurdity perpetrated by the worm who \"designed\" the menus. My dinner companions
    couldn't figure what was so funny about the menus being set in Comic Sans. So
    I explained, \"It's bad use of a font man. That's all you need to know.\"\r\n\r\nAnd
    I don't even drink alcohol. Makes people act like assholes.\r\n\r\nIt helps to
    point out that the guy who designed the font, Vince Connare, is a great a guy
    and a talented designer and artist in his own right who is also an excellent photographer,
    and the merit of his creation for microsoft has been exaggerated out of all proportion
    to its humble origin by stupid ignorant computer users and jerks who like nothing
    more than to grumble about it and post hate rants about it on the internet.\r\n\r\nGet
    over it.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: Hmm... this suggests that restaurants could make a lot of money by giving
    typophiles menus set in in Comic Sans.
