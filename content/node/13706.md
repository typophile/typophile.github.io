  born [[1420]] in [[France]].\r\n\r\nDuring the [[1450s]], [[Charles VII]] sent Nicholas
  Jenson to [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] to learn the art of printing. There he became an
  apprentice to [[Johann Gutenberg]].\r\n\r\nAfter a nasty civil war in [[1462]],
  most of Mainz's printers left the city. Many of them travelled to [[Italy]], including
  Jenson\u2014who ended up in [[Venice]] before [[1470]]. There, he cast his famous
  type, which might be the first non-[[blackletter]] type ever cast in the west.\r\n\r\nJenson
  died in [[Rome]] in [[1480]].\r\n\r\nMost typefaces that are named after Jenson
  bear little or no relation to his work. However, [[Bruce Rogers]]' [[Centaur]] comes
  very close to capturing its spirit."
