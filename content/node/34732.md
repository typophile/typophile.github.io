  body: "Several families have a hairline or thin weight, most of the ones I find
    don't have a circular 'o', unfortunately.\r\nBut, for example, FF Meta Hairline
    and FF Kievit Thin are both very thin. \r\nIf you search for 'thin' or 'hairline'
    at fontshop/myfonts, I'm sure there is something you like."
