  JB Hi-Fi logo is a particular typeface or custom-made. Thanks in advance! :D\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JB-HIFI_5448.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jbhifi_6190.jpg]"

  body: "With all the squared techno fonts out there you'd think this should be easy
    to match, but the closest resemblance I found, even searching freeware sites,
    was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bolt/|ITC Bolt]], which has squared
    counters and the wrong stroke width, or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/jay-gothic/|Jay
    Gothic Extra Bold]], which would need to be flattened/widened and otherwise massaged.\r\n\r\nThis
    leads me to think that it is possibly a custom lettering job.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    for what I'm doing. Thank you.\r\n\r\nIf anyone thinks they can identify it as
    an actual typeface, by all means post here though. :)"
