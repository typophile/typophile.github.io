  and announced it via this article at A List Apart:\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/real-web-type-in-real-web-context\r\n\r\nAs
  type designers and type sellers, I'd like your thoughts on what I've said in the
  ALA article. How do you feel about your growing market of web designers? What will
  it take to implement actual-context previews of your typefaces? How do you feel
  about type rendering in web browsers?\r\n\r\nAlso: web design folks with an interest
  in typography who may not know about Typophile will be looking to ALA's discussion
  forum for conversation. Please consider contributing your thoughts there as well.
  Web designers need your advice and expertise:\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/comments/real-web-type-in-real-web-context/\r\n\r\nTim"

    \r\n\r\nThanks Tim for this hard work and the specimen. I spent some of this morning
    reading your site and ALA and all the dozens of links involved and I have got
    some good ideas from the new stuff I read, thanks.  \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Andreas: Which website are you looking at? What browser and operating system
    are you using?\r\n\r\nDon: Good point, sir. I will give this some more thought
    and try to adjust my contrast. Can you see the page well enough to judge whether
    the type is rendering well? What is your OS/browser?\r\n\r\nDavid: Thanks for
    the kind words! I'm glad you found value in my work and related reads. :)\r\n\r\nEverybody:\r\nIn
    addition to thoughts about type design or type selling, does anyone have ideas
    about how Web Font Specimen can be improved as a means of exercising type? What
    other type specimens (in print, or anywhere) do you like?"

  body: "Tim -- The one shortcoming I found in the specimen is that so much of the
    text setting centers on only 13px size. \r\n\r\nThat may look fine in Georgia,
    but I think you'll find that when folks start testing other text fonts, 13px looks
    pretty small.\r\n\r\nI believe most text faces originally designed for print will
    sit smaller on the body (or at least on the x-height) than Georgia. So until we
    start seeing more faces designed specifically for screen, a lot of @font-face
    text may run small or need to be bumped. \r\n\r\nYour specimen would be more useful
    if it allowed for a range of paragraph settings from 13px to 16px (which I believe
    is the default in most browsers these days) for basal text samples.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I find the color samples with red and cyan pretty useless, personally. Who does
    that? (Except Roger Black maybe ;-) If you want to run text on color and knockout
    examples, you might use more common colors.\r\n\r\nThose are my personal responses.
    Obviously, I can just go in and rewrite parts of this to suit myself."

  body: "Oh, and I would suggest editing your generic text sample to include things
    like quotation marks (maybe both dumb and curly quotes) and question mark. \r\n\r\nEspecially
    the question mark, since this is a common punctuation mark and usually a complex
    glyph that may or may not render well in a coarse environment.\r\n\r\nWith that
    same reasoning, you might want to include the @ symbol either in text or in your
    waterfall.\r\n\r\nAnd you've got a typo in the label on the black-on-red block
    -- it should be #000 on <em>#F00</em> not #0FF.\r\n\r\n"

    actual-context previews of your typefaces?</cite>\r\n\r\nSpecimens like yours
    will be common because they\u2019re so easy to create. But if you want to text
    it on your sites, you\u2019ll have to pay. Nothing is stopping web designers from
    licensing a font to use on a test server. Most sites start as mockups in Photoshop
    or Fireworks, designers should have the fonts licensed for use in development
    at that stage. This is not something that should be free, and if you think it
    should, you need to correct your entitlement mentality. If actual-context previews
    are important to you making money as a web designer you need to pay for them,
    just as you paid for your computer.\r\n\r\n<cite>How do you feel about type rendering
    in web browsers?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s all been said a million times already.
    That said, hopefully someone will develop a TT autohinter optimized for small
    sizes. Maybe we\u2019ll even see a user-friendly TT hinting app hit the market."

  body: "<cite>...that page is too busy. How about some sub-pages to clear away all
    the stuff I don\u2019t need to read? Specifically the entire rightmost column.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's
    a good idea, James. Although in the two days since [[http://webfontspecimen.com|Web
    Font Specimen]] launched, many visitors have followed links in that rightmost
    column. I think it has been successful. What the page design lacks in brevity
    it makes up for in honesty\u2014everything's out in the open.\r\n\r\n<cite>Specimens
    like yours will be common</cite>\r\n\r\nWhen they are, that will be a great day!
    Agreed, WFS is nothing special\u2014except that, [[http://www.alistapart.com/articles/real-web-type-in-real-web-context|as
    I note in the ALA piece]], it belongs to us all. It's a beginning. Maybe the challenge
    for type sellers, if not making the specimen itself, will be making room on their
    websites to showcase type in real web context ... and striking a balance with
    folks who intend to use the type in other ways.\r\n\r\n<cite>This is not something
    that should be free</cite>\r\n\r\nI disagree here. Seeing type specimens in actual
    web context, as well as being hands-on with typefaces and actually putting them
    in test projects, will be free.\r\n\r\n[[http://people.mozilla.com/~jkew/woff/woff-spec-latest.html|WOFF]]
    should enable web designers to try type out, and should relieve type seller anxieties
    about license violation ... if my understanding is correct.\r\n\r\nThe legal idea
    behind WOFF, as I understand it, is that typeface license violation would not
    be forcibly prevented (like DRM) but would instead be something continually monitored
    by type sellers (or services they employ to do license-related sniffing). All
    WOFF does, legally, is take ordinary font files and add XML data that type sellers
    can use to match specific font files to detailed data elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBy this
    reasoning, discovering license violations would be equally easy (or difficult)
    regardless of whether a web designer has paid for the type they are previewing
    in their latest projects. If the type is being used publicly and is not licensed
    for such use, this violation would be caught.\r\n\r\nPut another way, if a type
    seller were to license WOFF files but attempt to charge for the ability to try
    them out, what's to stop web designers from finding a website that uses the type
    they seek, acquiring the WOFF file, and experimenting in a private space? Though
    perhaps type sellers could charge web designers for the convenience of not having
    to hunt around."

    - which is a very common setting for laptop screens n Windows. Some mfgs pre-set
    the OS at a larger display size (I forget what they call it in Windows Control
    Panel) which leaves IE8's default at 125% zoom because it picks up the setting
    from the OS. (All this as a remedy for the small screens.)\r\nThe overall width
    of the page is chopping off on the right, forcing a horizontal scroll.\r\nCan

  body: "Aw, thanks James. :)\r\n\r\nYour comment was what got me thinking about trying
    WOFF fonts freely, and your point here about everyone messing with bootleg fonts
    before paying to use them in projects is an apt model (although in WOFF's case,
    again if my understanding is correct, piracy could be detected). So I think we're
    discussing two issues now:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>HTML+CSS type specimens for browsing,
    and</li>\r\n<li>using WOFF fonts freely for testing purposes, before they're licensed</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nSo
    many foundries have expressed support for WOFF. I wonder, are these folks already
    planning methods of license enforcement? Is anyone thinking about such loose handling
    of WOFF files as we've discussed here?"
