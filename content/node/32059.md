    Black</a> is somewhat similar.

  body: Yeah, sadly it's from the old days of Apex when the bold counters were way
    too small.

  body: If you like those wee little counters, you will be happy to learn that Apex
    Serif is still in version 1, as seen on the Speak Up site. In fact, it's Bold
    (OpenType) Small Caps, which are outside the gamut of the mudTyper. (The next
    generation of the site's testing tool will accomodate OpenType.)
