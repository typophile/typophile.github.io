<p>I designed a logo and supplied it in svg, pdf, jpeg, png (typefaces outlined).</p>
<p>The client sent it to a freelance prototype engineer who contacted me for the font. I explained that the font was altered, creating custom logo and outlined -so having the font won&rsquo;t help. His response:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,
If you are not willing to send me the TFF file for this font I am going to have to go buy it for $106. I am not going to do this to use it just one time. I am not going to redraw it line by line either. You used it on your design so it would be nice to use it on the product. Give me a break here…&rdquo;</p>
<p>(the font is actually $45)
Bottom line: Is it custom to also include the font when supplying a logo to client?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>while i strenuously oppose restrictive EULAs (either boycotting the foundries or finding legitimate but less restrictive options) i must say that i think it&rsquo;s a good idea for designers to include either &ldquo;fonts not included&rdquo; or &ldquo;extra license fees&rdquo; in estimates and contracts.</p>
<p>it seems that the common practice of designers sending fonts to printers is what got us into this absurd EULA mess in the first place and, as has been detailed in several other threads, the public and the industry needs to be educated.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m currently working on a project where i have had to inform my client that foundries with specific restrictions on their EULA will not be considered in the design process, and even then the fonts ultimately chosen will have to be licensed separately by the client for further use.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Curious. Why would a prototype engineer need the font unless he is also doing design work?</p>
<p>If the font is going to be part of the client&rsquo;s corporate ID/branding the client should license the font for use among the company&rsquo;s staff of freelance designers. The fact that you used it in developing the logo doesnt obligate you to provide it to other designers. This is something you should take up with the client (not this designer). If he doesnt want to pay for the licensing maybe this guy should just pick another font.</p>
<p>But I know what kind of dilemma this can be. You want to continue working with this client and you dont want to be perceived as difficult to work with. My advice: explain it to them in a conscientious way that they are paying for your design services - not your software. Like you said, there&rsquo;s a learning curve, part of your job is to help educate them. But if they cant respect your professional practices, maybe they&rsquo;re not worth keeping as a client.</p>

<p>I thought it curious too. He’s simply applying the logo to a product. Additionally, the type was converted to outlines then altered so the logo can&rsquo;t be recreated simply using the font.</p>
<p>In general, I outline all art for clients and edit myself if needed. I’ve had clients purchase fonts for crossplatform which hasn’t been an issue (yet do have issues when although client purchases face, the layouts not looking as I’ve sent). This was first time I was asked for font.</p>

<p>It certainly would. The other reason is that the design was manipulated as part of the design process so the type outlines would not match the logo. I can&rsquo;t imagine a logo that does not need the outlines tuned for the brandname.</p>

<p>This may be another obvious qt.. again, did a typophile search but still unsure&hellip;When a client would like to regularly edit copy on a design format I’ve created, my client purchases the font(in addition to the one I ahve). I’m finding that clients like me to purchase and send the font to them (yes, believe it or not they have a hard time buying and downloading using the link I send or they end up buying a different version). How do I purchase a font but license it to my client? (yes, I&rsquo;m buying a version for me or already have one of my own)&hellip;&hellip;technically, I now have two of same font licensed to me.</p>
