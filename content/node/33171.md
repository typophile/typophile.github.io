body: "So, I basically threw this together in an evening. It sort of reminds me of
  the very narrow type used in movie credits on posters, except a little wider.\r\nI
  need to work on metrics a little (for example, L has too much space on the right).\r\nI'm
  also still working on implementing diacritics, but before I do, I need some advice
  for \xC6 and \u0152, which you can see at the bottom of my PDF. I created the first
  set by basically just sticking the letters together and adjusting where they connect.
  The second is opened up a little to help balance the counter. I think I like the
  second set better (certainly for \xC6), but what do you think?\r\nI haven't settled
  on a name yet--I always seem to come up with those at the very last."

  body: "This looks really nice.  I especially like the curve in the lower right of
    the G.  The second set of \xC6 / \u0152 look much better than the first.  \r\n\r\nI
    think the M is too wide. It stands out because it's about twice as wide as all
    the other characters. I'd make it close to the same width as the E, with diagonals
    at about 45 degrees which only reach down about 1/3 of the way from the top. Maybe
    try the same thing with the W (I'm assuming it's similar width to the M). I don't
    see the Cyrillic \u0416, but that's also a wide character with the potential to
    stand out too much."

  body: "I also find the M a bit too wide. The solution Matt has posted, sounds like
    it could work. The spine of the S seems a bit too geometric. It could be more
    smooth. \r\nI understand geometrics are the basis for this typeface, but especially
    then optical corrections are needed here and there.\r\nI like the G and the R,
    and the lower right curve of the G as well, although that one has a little bump
    in it. :)"

  body: "I too thought the M might be too wide. Let's try something more narrow.\r\n<a
    href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/m_height.png\">Here</a>
    I've made a series of Ms, starting with the original on the left. I narrowed so
    it's a bit more comfortable (It's still wider than the E, though, and I might
    try to narrow it a little more) and brought up the middle. I'm not sure how far
    to go, but I think you're right to suggest that it should go about 1/3 of the
    way down.\r\n\r\n<cite>Maybe try the same thing with the W (I\u2019m assuming
    it\u2019s similar width to the M).</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's actually the same width
    (with a little less space), but the angles make it look narrower. It's a lot less
    obtrusive. It may be okay, but I'll <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/w_height.png\">experiment</a>
    with it anyway. I've done the same thing here as with the M, but also widened
    the base a bit because it started to look odd as I lowered the middle.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Cyrillic, <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/basic_cyrillic.png\">here</a>
    is the full basic alphabet.\r\nI usually like to distinguish the Cyrillic \u041A
    from the Latin K, usually just by turning or hooking the arm, but this time I
    just let it be the same since I'm simplifying everything so much anyway. The \u0416
    is just built from two of these back-to-back, but it looks a little wide this
    way.\r\nI also considered making the \u0424 wider, but I'm afraid it'll become
    too big.\r\n\r\n<cite>The spine of the S seems a bit too geometric. It could be
    more smooth.</cite>\r\n\r\nGood point. I think there's <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/geometrics.png\">more
    than one solution</a> to this. I can keep it geometric and make it less horizontal,
    or I could really smooth it out. Either way, I think I need to adjust my proportions.\r\n\r\n<cite>although
    that one has a little bump in it. :)</cite>\r\n\r\nOops. <a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/fixedg.png\">Bump
    fixed</a> (on the left)."

  body: "I like the 6th and 7th Ms, and the last W, best. Have you tried sloping verticals
    on the M, so that it's basically an upside-down W? That sometimes looks good.
    \r\n\r\nI'd forgotten about the \u0428 and \u0429, which are equally wide in Cyrillic.
    Perhaps you don't need to take them, and the \u0416, down to as narrow as the
    rest of the characters, but I still think they will stand out somewhat in a line
    of text at their current almost double-width.\r\n\r\nI agree that the spine of
    the S is too horizontal -- I think it should be diagonal. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this
    is great work and I'm glad that my comments were helpful. \r\n\r\n-matt"

    it has already improved. \r\nThe second S from the left is looking far more natural,
    eventhough it is still pretty geometric. The second one from the right is also
    ok, though the right one is not geometric enough anymore, in my opinion. "
