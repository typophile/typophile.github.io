  body: "That's really beautiful Geo. I didn't recognize the k at first, but seeing
    it in some words will probably make it more recognizable. I don't like the sloping
    bar of the e--it seems heavier then the thins in the other letters and I don't
    see the same stress angle in the other round letters.\r\n\r\nEron"

  body: "eron,\r\nthanks very. this is my first face (though the fourth version) and
    i am much in need of critical eyes. \r\n\r\nre: the k, my concern is that the
    horizontals are too close together. see sample words below.\r\n\r\nre: the e,
    yes.... i wrestled with that bar a lot. numerous variations. I think that inline
    and especially at smaller scale, the angle is less noticable, but i would be glad
    to hear your thoughts.  the weight i am still very uncertain of. the stress is
    the same as the other rounds except the o and d, whose interiors are rotated slightly
    to keep the set line from appearing to wobble and in the q. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample
    words_5541.png]36pts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: these are all hand set and the spacing
    is various. any comments on spacing would be greatly appreciated, as i am preparing
    to 'fontify' these chars now (or as soon as i make any mods based on critiques
    recieved here).\r\n\r\ngeo."
