  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone&hellip;I&rsquo;m not at all lazy, but I&rsquo;m sad to say that I don&rsquo;t have a natural eye for design.  My best friend does and I&rsquo;ve noticed over the years that she has helped me &ldquo;develop&rdquo; my eye.  When I created a logo for my company (she was swamped at the time) and asked for her opinion, I thought she was going to reach through the phone and strangle me&hellip;I&rsquo;d used what I now know is the much-typophile-hated font, Papyrus.  Anyway, I digress&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often trying to pair fonts, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the last year about fonts, but I&rsquo;m still not confident about my pairing ability.  Can you guys offer me some rules or guidelines for choosing complementary fonts?  Most of the time I&rsquo;m using them for print, although if there are different rules for the web (other than understanding what fonts will be picked up by browsers) I&rsquo;d like to read your thoughts on that too.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is out of town at the moment, but I can tell you that I have many times put two together only to have her tell me I was totally wrong&hellip;still I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m hopeless.  Just slow to develop.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just a lil&rsquo;bit more info&hellip;the only rule I know (and use) is not to mix font categories.  Unfortunately, the only categories I really know are the broadest three: sans, serif and script (don&rsquo;t mean to insult or irritate anyone if I&rsquo;m not correct).</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ll never get caught using Papyrus again, for illustrative purposes would anyone be willing to explain to me the qualities you&rsquo;d observe about the font in choosing a complement for it?  What questions about the known font should I ask myself in order to create a pair?  I can&rsquo;t even categorize a font like Papyrus so that means the only rule I know is ineffective to me in that instance.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone in advance for your thoughtful responses!!!</p>

<p>If you just want a basic understanding I would say it&rsquo;s simply a technical matter, and you don&rsquo;t need to invest tonnes of time to have a fundamental understanding of how different types contrast. The two most helpful starting books for me were <em>Design With Type</em> by Carl Dair and <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> by Robert Bringhurst. Either is a great read and good to have around as a reference if you plan to do work with type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This [[http://www.typography.com/email/2010_03/index.htm|newsletter]] from Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones (prominent type designers) does a nice job of explaining some combinations for (their) typefaces.</p>
<p>This [[http://www.typophile.com/node/32056|listing]] shows various Typophile posts on pairing fonts.</p>
<p>What do you mean exactly about not mixing categories? Surely, using a sans font for display/larger text and a serif for text/smaller text is a fairly traditional method of pairing.</p>
<p>The qualities to observe can vary. For example, say you want to use Helvetica. Simply relying on boldness/weight to provide contrast can allow you to use a regular version and a bold version of the same typeface. They complement each other because they share the same shapes/forms/style but differ in the thickness/weight.</p>
<p>On the topic of Papyrus, I would classify it as a distressed (roughened/textured) script. Something can be a script without looking like cursive; Papyrus is closer to calligraphy. You needn&rsquo;t swear off Papyrus forever, because I&rsquo;m guessing you don&rsquo;t have any other fonts like it (if interested, [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/papyrus/|this]] is a helpful list). Just know that Papyrus is very widespread in its use. Many designers consider it amateurish due to its misuse and overuse.</p>
<p>If you truly want to develop a greater sense for these things, I encourage you to read Typophile regularly. I have found it invaluable. Also, experiment and practice can only help.</p>
<p>Apologies for the long response.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My understanding is that one rule of thumb is not to combine two faces in the <em>same</em> category.</p>
<p>Thus, mixing Franklin Gothic and Times Roman is not so bad, because there is a strong contrast between them, one a bold sans-serif, and one a normal serif, but mixing faces that are similar (yet definitely different, and thus not matching), such as Caslon and Times Roman is what one isn&rsquo;t supposed to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly sure that this has been given as a rule of thumb to beginning typographers in a number of textbooks on the subject.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m at least glad that when I followed the link given, I found a link in that discussion to [[Typeface Pairing]] which gave a link to</p>
<p>[[http://typophile.com/node/45613]]</p>
<p>which shows that I was not imagining things when I said that a strong contrast is the &ldquo;safe, boring&rdquo; recommendation.</p>
<p>However, you don&rsquo;t need to use a sans-serif for titles if you are intending to use a different face from the serif type used for body copy. An Egyptian will do. A Clarendon will do. Even the contrast between Bodoni for headings and a serif Roman which is not a modern will do. (Although, to be safe, one likely will use a bold weight for the headings for a little extra contrast.)</p>
<p>However, while contrast is good, another one of the safe rules of thumb, I saw from that thread, is not to combine two faces with a strong personality. So one doesn&rsquo;t use two display faces at once. No mixing Papyrus with Hobo, or Cooper Black with Comic Sans, or even Amelia with Albertus.</p>
