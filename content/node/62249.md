body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI'm designing an invite for a Hindu wedding, it will be folded halfway
  horizontally, the only constraint other than the language is the Ganesh image on
  the outer cover. The bride wants paisley designs on the card and to keep it quite
  formal and also white so that she can write the names of the invitees.\r\n\r\nI
  can't decide whether this is working, and having done 4 different versions can't
  see the wood for the trees. Would welcome any and all criticism.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inside_4792.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/outside_6035.jpg]"

  body: I think it's beautiful. The only thing that stood out at first glance is the
    gold scrolls that accompany the paisley pattern - just looks a bit tribal to me.
    And maybe something slightly lighter for the parents' names? Other than that,
    looks good to me.

  body: The paisleys seem a bit overpoweringly dark. If this is going to be printed
    offset, you might consider screening them back somewhat. This will give a bit
    more delicacy. If letterpress, you might want to explore a third color.
