body: "Hi guys (and girls)\r\n\r\nJust found the site at an apt time in my life, so
  hoping to learn something and share ideas. Also creating my first font after 15
  years as a professional digital artist (shameful, yes) but that's another topic.\r\n\r\nI
  searched the forum but didn't see anything about this in the results. Wasn't sure
  if it should go in Design section as it's more general to all font use in browsers,
  especially now with CSS3 and @font-face. Feel free to move it if you like.\r\n\r\n<strong>I
  am curious how the rest of you handle webfonts when it comes to various browsers
  and platforms</strong>, as far as front-end web design goes, not designing typefaces.
  I use Mac, and I've noticed that webkit browsers render fonts considerably thinner
  than the others. If using a font face that isn't too thin, I can usually get some
  wiggle room using -webkit-font-smoothing in CSS3 to force them in the direction
  I need. Sometimes a font needs to be abandoned though because it just won't hold
  up, and using this method in Safari on retina MacBooks can make them alias.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  when using thin fonts, they usually fall apart in webkit browsers at smaller sizes,
  whereas Firefox renders them excellent\u2014which surprised me because Firefox seemed
  to be falling off for a while, and now even has exceptional support for CSS3 with
  very smooth, snappy animations that are surpassing Chrome and Safari in my recent
  tests. Firefox always seemed to render fonts a bit bolder, so maybe I just prefer
  the way it renders them now since it's getting so much better in other aspects it
  lacked in ;)\r\n\r\nTypically, I try and use font faces that either (a) aren't too
  thin, or (b) ones that have various weights, so I can assign a bolder face overall,
  and then define thinner fonts for Firefox in an @moz media query. This doesn't work
  though when a font falls apart in a single browser, as it's difficult if not impossible
  to target a specific browser version without excessive and unreliable methods, let
  alone tell how it will behave in different OSs or on different devices.\r\n\r\nSafari
  is truly the most horrible at the moment, and I used to live in it on the web. I've
  read some posts on here where others are also becoming more and more displeased
  with Apple's descent into this sterile, jail mentality of \"experience things how
  we say or not at all.\" Thin font faces that hold up in Chrome just start aliasing
  in Safari. It could be that now with a retina MacBook Pro I'm just seeing more nastiness
  than before, but Chrome and Opera are doing a better job regardless. Overall I find
  the retina display beautifully renders type, but it's heavily dependent on the software
  being used, in this case browsers. Standard fonts look great unless very thin and
  not used in titles (helvetica neue thin comes to mind).\r\n\r\nToday I did a test
  with Adobe's Source Sans Pro, subset with fontsquirrel, and tried with the various
  hinting settings and em square of 1000 and 2048. I also tried with the prepackaged
  webfonts from Adobe on github, though massive in size for web. Either way, the extra
  light dies in Safari unless it's a large title font (i.e. with a base of 16px set
  to 2-4 em it can hold up, yet still thinner than it should be), and is very very
  thin in Chrome and Opera. Firefox renders it a bit bolder and it looks great\u2014it
  is nice and thin but solid enough where it is perfectly legible. Granted, this is
  a light face, but not the thinnest by any means.\r\n\r\nAlso, now with new devices
  coming out every Tuesday, curious how you all handle checking fonts in your web
  designs. I stopped running Windows about a year ago because I was sick of it dying
  for no reason, and Microsoft trying to tell me I didn't own it, when I bit the bullet
  and paid for it outright. I still have it in Parallels though. Do you use any online
  services (paid, free), do you buy extra devices, etc.? Do you think font rendering
  should be standardized when it comes to standard apps like browsers, instead of
  making font designers and web designers have to do so much extra work trying to
  give people the same experience? AND do you think standardization would become easier
  if we dispensed with software patents, where much of this seems to stem from (short
  answer version will suffice here so we don't start a war about GPL/FOSS).\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  curious to know how the rest of you approach this, if you assign different weights
  based on browsers, and how you go about testing on various devices. I personally
  am still broke and can't afford a testing service like Microsoft's, or buying all
  these devices to test on, still crippled from the lovely dump the economy took on
  us.\r\n\r\nSorry it's a bit long-winded but I could have expanded more as there
  are many variables when handling fonts in web design based on the project and demographic.
  It seems this is one area where technology is definitely not making life easier,
  and too much time is wasted trying to make things work without even getting into
  fallbacks and fighting with IE.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    to be ashamed of  as the years roll by and font projects get delayed. My  project
    took 50 years and counting!"

  body: "Hi Vlad\r\n\r\nI use fontsquirrel also for webfonts. Works well. My problem
    really is testing all the various OSs, browsers, and devices, and was curious
    what others were doing to compensate for drastic differences.\r\n\r\nI didn't
    wait as long as you :) I must say though, while tedious, I'm finding font designing
    very meditative, and also very fun, as I'm able to setup the fonts the way I prefer,
    particularly in spacing, kerning, and alignment of certain characters.\r\n\r\nI
    still have to work out the proper spacing for European languages, but most letters
    seem similar with just the added diacritics."

  body: "Hi Darren\r\nSpacing the Latin letters matching the Arabic was made much
    simpler using Fontlab's automatic function! I know this is hardly ideal, but I
    was impressed at how even the Latin font now looks. Same for kerning. Kerning
    similar letters is done using the classes system in Fontlab. Always something
    new to learn. My main concern is the Arabic, and Fontsquirrel does not do webfonts
    of non Latin scripts.\r\nGood luck with your project.\r\n"
