I've also had a little chat with Hakkinen when he was still a test driver waiting for the team to finally get rid of that retard Michael Andretti. I have Mika's autograph, and those of Prost* and Wendlinger too. The last race was a total dozer - but tomorrow's will rock! <BR> <BR>* But I never liked him, even though he's half Armenian. You know what's hillarious? I made him autograph the back of a Senna sticker without him realizing!  :-&gt; <BR> <BR>I've been to six races total, two of them in Phoenix (you probably went to those, eh?), and you're right, it's not big in the US. It's probably not rigged enough (even with the safety car bull). <BR> <BR>Chicky, if you ever manage to get to an actual F1 race* it's hard not to get emotionally attached, and make a point to watch every race at least live on TV for the rest of your life. <BR> <BR>* Except not Montecarlo, unless you're rich: the general admission there puts you on boulders like a mile away! You can't even tell the teammates apart without binoculars. Although the atmosphere there is unique. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Obviously it is a matter of preference. <BR> <BR>It's more a matter of human ergonomics versus wannabe minimalism. <BR> <BR>Many functions are done with the second button (as you seem to realize with your tablet), but most Mac users stick with the default. You have all those fingers, why force people to reach for a key with the other hand? The answer in this case is simple: it's easier to sell the stuff to people (especially all the insecure ones -the &quot;rest of us&quot; as Apple calls them- that are afraid of computers), nevermind that they'll suffer in the long term, once they graduate beyond retard mode. Except by then they have little idea of what's on the &quot;other side&quot;, and they've spent so much money that guilt precludes regret. <BR> <BR>&gt; XP seems very heavy handed and ungainly. <BR> <BR>It's not as &quot;pretty&quot; I guess, but in the end they're both ugly to me - but one of them admits it, and doesn't mind much. It's what's inside that counts - and as much as I loathe MS, XP does work very well. From what I know the newer MacOSes (unlike the previous ones) work well also, but the fact that they pretend to be visually sophisticated is annoying. It's all the same stale Sexy Robot crap. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. So what do Windows users use their left hand for? ;-) <BR> <BR>Seriously, I've got a three-button mouse (with scroll wheel) on my Mac. The scroll wheel is the thing I most appreciate. I can never remember what the middle button is programmed to do, and it takes relatively difficult contortions to press it anyway (probably a connection there). The right button is nice, but control-click is just as easy. Sometimes I accidentally hit the left button while holding down the right button, a mistake that can't happen with a one-button mouse. In general, I find the multi-button mouse a bit less comfortable to use since you have to hold it with the thumb and two fingers instead of the thumb and three fingers, and the remaining two fingers must be more precisely placed. But I'm totally hooked on that scroll wheel. <BR> <BR>The idea that a one-button mouse is for those with half a brain is ridiculous. If anything, it would engage both right and left sides of the brain more fully, since you need both hands for certain mouse operations. I'm not saying it's necessarilly better, but it's not necessarilly worse, either. Just different approaches with advantages and disadvantages on both sides.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">AT this time, I feel OSX and XP are both pretty ugly. I have switched from Mac to PC when Apple was still Steve-Job-less and never looked back, but the new OSX-Look would have driven me away for sure. And even on XP, you can't really like the look unless you switch off a lot of effects, hack the bootscreen, change the icons, the colours and basically make th system look the way you want it. On Win2000 I used WinBlinds to customize the look, on XP I just hacked it a bit and that is quite enough. The simpler the better. I argue that an Operating System for professionals (not the Home-versions, mind) should be as lean and efficient and most of all customizable as possible. XP and OSX are overloaded.  <BR> <BR>Hrant &ndash; the logi Mouses do work on Mac. The MX 700 is the best mouse available at the moment. While the one-button-g4-Mouse looks great, it just isn't any good at all, except maybe writing letters. The only worse mouse was that awful idiotic  round iMac Mouse :-D.</div>

The Mx 700 has 8 Buttons plus the absolute essential Mousewheel, and they are ALL important and Logi managed to make them all ergonomical and easy and intuitive to work with as well as fully programable. When I work as a lecturer in a design school, I sometimes have to work with the one-button-G4-mouse and it is terrible even for the simple task of surfing the web. It's just nicer to be able to surf with right hand only, using mouse buttons for back and forward or scrolling with the wheel, while you can drink a nice cup of coffee with the left hand :-).</div>

Both kinds of mouse have advantages and disadvantages and I'm not convinced that one is an overwhelmingly better solution than the other.  <BR> <BR>The scroll wheel, on the other hand, lets you do something with a flick of the finger that would otherwise require moving the mouse to a different screen location (involving greater hand-eye coodination) and clicking or dragging interface elements.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I will admit that Apple's recent mouse designs have been bad. The round one was the worst, but the current lozenge-shaped one isn't too good either. My favorite was the pre-iMac tear-drop-shaped mouse. It was comfortable and responsive. The recent ones are nice to look at, but there is definitely too much geometry and not enough ergonometry.</div>

The bikes run on alcohol and only go about 70-80 mph, BUT, they have no brakes - its great.  The course is oval and most of it is in the corners, so the riders lean into the bend, with one foot on the floor, requiring them to wear thick metal plates in their left shoes - mental. <BR>There's also a thing called ice speedway, which is the same but, yes on ice.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Which scrolly mouse has one button?&hellip; </i> <BR>  <BR>None that I know of. As I said, I'm using a multi-button mouse with a scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is the thing I miss when I use a regular Mac mouse, not the extra buttons. I wouldn't mind a one-button mouse with a scroll wheel. Even better would be if I could also use it to scroll horizontally. It's really annoying when I get to one of those oddball sites that scrolls horizontally and I have to scroll using the scroll bar. ;-) <BR> <BR>Interestingly, Apple recently got a patent for a mouse with a dial on it that can scroll both directions. <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/columns/devilsadvocate/2003/20030425.shtml" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.macobserver.com/columns/devilsadvocate/2003/20030425.shtml">http://www.macobserver.com/columns/devilsadvocate/2003/20030425.shtml</a></a> <BR> <BR>My complaints with Apple's current lozenge-shaped mouse are that the click is too stiff (even at the lowest setting), the top end of the mouse where you click is too large (at least for me&ndash;I have smaller than average hands), and it's trickier to pickup and move the mouse in the middle of a drag operation since nearly the whole mouse is a button. Plus, it doesn't have a scroll wheel. :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow. In a case like that, a horizontal scroll wheel wouldn't be much use to me anyway. With unusually long (or wide) pages, I tend to use the keyboard for scrolling (option+arrow keys to jump a screenful at a time). I find the scroll wheel works best for smaller, less continuous amounts. For going through pages and pages of stuff, it gets rather inefficient.  <BR> <BR>One thing you may have noticed on that MacObserver page is that not all Mac users are happy with the one-button mouse. But, as you yourself have often pointed out, people don't always know what's best for them. ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><b>What can chrome do for you?</b> <BR> <BR>Like many, I've long been enamoured of Apple's industrial design, UI, advertising, et al. They are one of the few companies in any sector that consistently realizes the potential of design as a differentiator. You can buy a dell for 1/3 to 1/4 of what a Apple desktop will cost you, but who wants to look at it &ndash; on or off! Apple gets the design = value equation like few others. <BR> <BR>That said, they seem to have joined the ranks of the great unwashed in their race to create the puffiest logo. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17363.jpg" alt="Uglies"> <BR> <BR>We should have seen it coming with the proliferation of glowing, pulsing jelly bean buttons, drop shadows, liquid animations, I guess. Design at Apple is now treading a dangerous line between innovation and novelty. This new logo can only be seen as the latter. It's an indulgence of Apple's new material fetish and has nothing to do with design, communication, or signalling any kind of real or positive change. It's insecure, trendy, and destined share the fate of Disney's Tomorrowland.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">for the Mac, &lt;command click&gt; is used for non- <BR>consecutive selection (but, shift serves this function in  <BR>the Classic Finder). &lt;option click&gt; serves various useful  <BR>functions depending on the application, but in the  <BR>Finder it allows you to close the preceding window as  <BR>you open the next. &lt;control click&gt; is the equivalent of  <BR>Windows right-click. &lt;shift click&gt; allows for non- <BR>consecutive selection in the finder and consecutive  <BR>selection elsewhere (why this happened, I don't know). <BR> <BR>the &lt;option&gt; key on Mac keyboards is the equivalent of  <BR>&lt;alt&gt;, and on some keyboards (possibly all now) it  <BR>actually says &lt;alt&gt; in smaller type.</div>
