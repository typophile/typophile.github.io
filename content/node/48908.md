  does anyone have a good idea of what serif face would work nicely with Neutraface?\r\n\r\nThanks

    What is your project? Who is your audience?

  body: "If Neutraface is the display face, a modern (didone) would be a good text
    complement.\r\nOr possibly a non-geo slab serif, e.g. Archer or Bodoni Egyptian.\r\n\r\nIf
    Neutraface is the text, you could try matching a modern where the hairline corresponds
    to the weight of the text monoline.\r\nTo see this effect, set up some 72 pt text
    in <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html\">Scotch Modern Display</a>
    in the type tester, and put the window next to a showing of <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfontspecimens\">Neutraface
    Light</a>\r\n\r\nBut really, any true (\"optically sized\") display face with
    lots of fine detail would complement the strong personality and sparkle of Neutraface
    text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi..context is a wedding invitation. I don't want to set ALL the text in
    Neutraface..just the RSVPs and the couple's names. The rest can be in another
    face...preferably serif - still have the programme to do and I don't envision
    the service notes in Neutraface!\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions..will look
    at them. At the moment I've used Mrs Eaves...for lack of something better."

  body: Ah wedding invitations. Ok. Well maybe Paperback doesn't reflect the style
    or intent. Are you shooting for something mid-century mod or what?
