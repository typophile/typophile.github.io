  body: "It seems to be the typeface [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces4.html|Bubble]],
    shown in this sample from the Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide. The image came from
    the Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book, meaning that this was a photo-type.
    I think there is a digital version of Dubble Bubble, but I don't know about the
    regular weight.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
