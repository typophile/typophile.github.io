  body: "I think this is hand calligraphy. Look at the S letters. They are not all
    identical. Once you realize that and start checking other letters, you can see
    that there are other variations that I do not think would be alternate glyphs
    in a font. \r\n\r\nIt's beautifully done calligraphy though.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
