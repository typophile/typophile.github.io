  body: Wow. File this under Crazy Font ID Coincidences. I just identified <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_lennox_book/&sample_text=VALMOUR&sample_size=94">ITC
    Lennox</a> for a client today on a totally different sample. It's also the first
    time I've paid any attention to the face, perhaps due to its lame lowercase. The
    caps are lovely.
