  keep the pixeldetails?

    asking how to print it so it's obviously pixelated, you'd want to exaggerate the
    pixels by increasing the print size of the image."

  body: "I'd do this:\r\n\r\n1. Take the screenshot.\r\n2. Dump it into Photoshop\r\n3.
    Go to Image > Image Size\r\n4. Change Resolution to 150 (or 300) pixels/inch\r\n5.
    Turn off \"Resample Image\"\r\n6. Click OK\r\n\r\nThe image won't appear on screen
    to be any different because all you've done is tell it to render more pixels per
    printed inch. Of course, it'll print smaller now. 150 dpi is usually enough to
    remove obvious pixels, but you don't say exactly what you're doing so you might
    need 300."
