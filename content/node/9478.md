  body: I think Kent once told me that he resisted making a Bold-Italic originally
    but he knew he eventually would have to make one. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I really do hope he comes up with a Bold-Italic as many creative people have
    a high demand for it. <BR>[I did contact Kent about that but got no reply]

  body: Markus <BR> <BR>Some designers choose to leave out bold italic on purpose,
    when they make classic book faces. I did the same with Delicato. depending on
    demands I might reconcider this in the future, just like Hrant mentioned Kent
    did...  <BR><a href="http://www.macrhino.com" target="_blank">http://www.macrhino.com</a>

  body: Wow - Delicato is also one of my favourites!! And reconsidering a Bold Italic
    is a very good decision - many will highly appreciate that.
