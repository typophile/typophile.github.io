    rather than typographi.ca because everyone gets the email alerts. But I was excited
    and jumpy and then I ran to the radio. <BR> <BR>That was awesome. Matthew is the
    coolest. One of my coworkers said we should start a fan club for him.

    <BR>As for conversion between bezier and polar systems: <BR>1&#41; It can never

    Any idea why this is? My limited common sense would lead me to believe that one
    smooth Bezier would be more intuitive than several small consecutive arcs. Maybe
    there&#39;s a difference between what&#39;s mechanically intuitive and what&#39;s
    conceptually intuitive... <BR> <BR>Sorry for being so off-topic.'

    <BR> <BR>Lots of trouble. I used a transparent gridded sheet to check  <BR>the

    where I entered the arguments for the  <BR>basic functions &#40;move, line and
    arc&#41;. Each character was a  <BR>function which called a series of these basic
    functions. I  <BR>checked the rendering visually &#40;using a grid&#41; and made
