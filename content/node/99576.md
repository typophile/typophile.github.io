body: I'm a Ross MBA student an mobile app entrepreneur.  I am creating a wedding
  app that will cater to the high end of the market.  I am looking for something that
  straddles the line between high/end elegant and fun/hip.  My target customer is
  mid to late twenties.  Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! (and possibly
  purchased)

    FontFonts</a>. I don\u2019t know about many foundries offering app licenses for
    sale directly, but my guess is most will be accomodating if you approach them
    directly."

    if designing a custom wedding \"identity\" is part of what your app might be doing
    then Frode's line of thought is probably just as relevant as choosing a typeface
    for yourself: you'll need to figure out how to offer a great assortment of high-quality
    fonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
