		<div class="commentbody">Gareth, have you seen it in person? I&#39;d be curious if it is worth buying only the $50.00 version. Does it read well, or does one feel like they are in a book-form of a David Carson dream? Do you think that version is still something worth collecting?  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.wdny.com/Pages/vas.html" target="_blank">http://www.wdny.com/Pages/vas.html</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">VAS, regardless of what your end opinion of the book is, is worth $50. It&#39;s not a book that you&#39;re supposed to read page by page. It&#39;s more like a meandering. It&#39;s pretty cool, but I&#39;m sure a lot of people get ticked off by the fact that is anything but typical. If I had one word to describe it I&#39;d use &#42;insane&#42;. <BR> <BR>Tomasula doesn&#39;t follow a genre, he does &#34;writing as a contemporary/conceptual art form.&#34; <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~andnow/"> Check out his &amp;NOW Writing Festival</a> from last year. I won&#39;t take credit for that stylin&#39; logo. <BR> <BR>This is an interesting post because Tomasula works at <a href="http://www.nd.edu/"> Notre Dame</a>, where I went to school, and I did a project for him when I was a student. Currently, my former professor and I are working on the next Tomasula book, entitled The Book of Portraiture. We just started &#40;reading&#41; so I don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s going to look like. It does start with the origin of handwriting, so I think I&#39;ll be asking some questions here in the next couple months. I don&#39;t imagine it being of the magnitude of VAS, as it&#39;s a different publisher and the budget is &#42;quite&#42; different...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, from a narrative point of view, how&#39;s the book? The description is...vague. Or, rather, what&#39;s the content of the book? It looks fascinating and I&#39;m up always up for experimental stuff, but I don&#39;t like digging through concept to find nothing underneath.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#34;I haven&#39;t read the whole thing,&#34; said Dan with a hint of embarrassment. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have $50 and only possessed it for a day or two, so, I don&#39;t know how its literature holds up. I can&#39;t say I dig the &amp;NOW stuff 100% and the idea of &#34;doing something just to do it&#34; &#40;kills me&#41;, but Tomasula&#39;s reputation is pretty solid. And I don&#39;t think Farrell would wrap art/design like that around a pile of crap. Also, if you like when characters&#39; names are the names of shapes then you&#39;re sitting pretty. <BR> <BR>Additionally, <a href="http://designobserver.com/"> Design Observer .com</a> lists it as a &#34;book they recommend.&#34; I imagine that&#39;s where Tiffany got her link? <BR> <BR>Also of note is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0226807401/qid=1106622895/sr=8-7/ref=pd_ka_2/104-4692125-8770327?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"> Amazon has the book in soft-cover</a> now. I haven&#39;t seen that version, but the hard-cover is quite impressive. <BR> <BR>Other links: <BR><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/"> www.nd.edu/~stomasul/</a> <BR><a href="http://www.nd.edu/%7Estomasul/VAS_homepage.html"> www.nd.edu/%7Estomasul/VAS_homepage.html</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany Wardle : I purchased the paperback version due to difficulties ordering the cloth cover. But I am thinking of purchasing the cloth cover so I can treat this copy with contempt and error, and I am a poor student. <BR> <BR>Personally, I fell in love with the idea of a novel being constructed visually from a typographers translation and relationship with the author.  <BR> <BR>I do think it reads well. But I may be more tolerant towards the design than others. But even if someone did not enjoy the read, I think it worth populating any collection.  <BR> <BR>Chris Rugen : Steve Tomasula is not infamous for his ability to write empty literature.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/VAS_homepage.html" target="_blank">http://www.nd.edu/~stomasul/VAS_homepage.html</a> <BR> <BR>This link may help define VAS more for you.
