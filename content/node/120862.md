  and film\r\nb) French Cinema and film through History\r\n\r\nI understand this is
  wide open to a lot of interpretation!\r\nIf it helps the cover will include a still
  from the French film \" The Artist\" (Black and white film, but made in 2011).\r\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655442/\r\n\r\nThe
  client has asked for a bold modern cover (ha).\r\nThough the actual film is a modern
  interpretation of a silent movie.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJason"

  body: "Hi Both,\r\n\r\nThank you I have tried the various options you have suggested
    on layout. Some interesting covers developing.\r\nOne font that is looking nice
    is Parisian BT .\r\nI also think the Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s font could look really
    interesting used really big and covering most of the image. I doubt the publisher
    would go for it, but I will try it in any case. Because you never know.\r\n"

    who were formally innovative\u2014e.g. Melies, Gance, Cocteau, Godard, and now
    Hazanavicius.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s true that Cassandre\u2019s Peignot was also
    formally innovative in its day, it has rather a traditional art deco look, even
    in the true unicase setting.\r\n\r\nWhy not go with something post-modern that
    suggests innovation today? \r\nPierre di Sciullo: http://www.quiresiste.com/realisations.php?lang=en\r\n\r\nExcoffon,

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nThanks for sending me Excoffons way. I know some of his fonts
    but had no idea they were by a French Foundry/designer. Mistral looks a bit American
    to me for some reason.\r\nThey are the sort of fonts I would dismiss often as
    they are so unique/different.\r\nThat is very often a reason for using them of
    course as design is often about making a statement/making something unique. Banco
    is a really interesting one.\r\n\r\nHi Kthomps5,\r\nThanks I will have a look
    at your link. I have done a layout already using the Jean-Luc Godard face.\r\nIt's
    certainly got power on the page and looks really modern somehow. Seems a little
    similar to Knockout.\r\nDon't know if I can do the kind of Justification Jean-Luc
    uses in his title sequences though. \r\nIt just doesn't sit well to my eye, though
    many designers would disagree. "

    a different scenery: type like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/marlowe/|Marlowe]]

    review of type in the film The Artist. For a very long time I feel that lettering
    and type is awkwardly neglected by film makers, mostly. Mark\u2019s article opened
    my eyes upon how crucial (!) script and lettering is for a silent movie in particular.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brain_4880.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rauchen_6502.png]"
