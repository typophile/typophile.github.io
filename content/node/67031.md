body: "Hi\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell if it's possible to delete OT Classes using Python.
  I have tried something like:\r\n\r\nfor k in range(len(f.classes)):\r\n  s = f.classes[k][0]\r\n
  \ if s==\"_\":\r\n    del f.classes[k]\r\n\r\nto delete every class that starts
  with an underscore, but this approach doesn't work. Is there another way to delete
  classes or am I doing something stupid?\r\n\r\ntia\r\nM"

  body: Yeah, very strange behaviour of the API. The elements of the list are read-only
    but the enclosing structure can be overwritten. I ended up with the same workaround.

  body: "Two things: \r\n\r\n1. When you delete an element from a list, the number
    of items in the list obviously is reduced by one. But the initial range(len())
    loop is just a static list so if you remove any elements, you'll get an \"Index
    out of range\". This is why Karsten is iterating through the loop in the descending
    order of elements. This is not FontLab-specific, it would happen with every Python
    list for which you'd remove elements that way. \r\n\r\n2. Many of FontLab's pseudolist
    objects only implement partial behavior of list objects. But you can assign such
    pseudolist object to a real Python list, then perform some list modifications,
    and then reassign the list back to the FontLab pseudolist. I don't consider this
    \"normal behavior\" but, well, the FontLab Python API was developed quite a few
    years ago and some of the objects behave a bit strangely. "
