  commercials only. (Taken from youtube so a little blurry).\r\n\r\nhttp://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/23/2399346a3eb304aed87e9874275466d2.29253.jpeg\r\n\r\nAny
  one with any idea? I think its defining characteristic is the way it sloopes downward
  at the top of the D, R and downward at the bottom of the U's, G, etc.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be sweet"
