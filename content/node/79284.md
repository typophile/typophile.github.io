  far to the left they should be placed?

  body: "I use John Hudson's method and it seems to get the desired effect:\r\n\r\n1.
    Design the spacing diacritic mark on the width of the lowercase o.\r\n\r\n2. For
    the combining diacritic mark use the spacing mark, then drag the left sidebearing
    onto the right.\r\n\r\nThe result is a combining mark that will give good position
    over a preceding a, e or u -- and perfect position over the o.\r\n"

    an o and aligning to that. (checks)  Yup, same result.\r\n\r\nI don't have much
    experience using combining diacriticals. When a font is used, how does that resulting
    accent end up in the correct spot over both a dotless i, capital W etc?"

  body: 'What happens to below diacriticals in italics? Should I offset them as if
    they were under an italic o, in which case the below accents end up a bit further
    to the left or should they align with their upper counterparts. For example: uni030A
    (ring comb) vs. uni0325 (ring below comb)'

  body: "There is no <em>perfect</em> way, and (hopefully) people working with your
    zero-width diacritics are aware of that. Unless you make your font monospaced,
    of course! ;-)\r\n\r\nTheoretically, lower diacritics in italics should be offset
    a bit to the left, just as the upper ones should be offset to the right. I use
    something like an old-style 'phi' character -- an 'o' with a slighly slanted vertical
    line through it -- to visually align diacritics. But that's only going to look
    perfectly on the o's, slightly less so on a, e, g, n, and u, and like crap on
    an i, f, m or w; it's the same here as with the roman accents, only angled slightly.\r\n\r\nTheoretically
    (again), you should use the Opentype \"mark\" and \"mkmk\" features, which are
    designed <em>exactly</em> to deal with this; but I find programming them incredibly
    difficult, and the output software I use (Adobe InDesign) still doesn't support
    these features to the level I need it to."

    are the worst case scenarios, so I made them as precomposed characters with \"the
    usual accents\" and used \"rlig\" to look them up (I think nowadays I'd probably
    use \"ccmp\"; only on principal grounds, 'cause I don't think it really makes
    that much a difference)."

  body: "Ray,\r\n\r\nI do what Theunis does, except I always make up a precomposed
    character (and use ccmp). Remember to name the precomposed character with base
    names -- the *i* rather than the *dotlessi*. So, for example, an i with a macron
    and acute could be named uni012B0301, or uni006903040301. There would be no Unicode
    index assigned.\r\n\r\nThe two possible names brings up one weakness in the system.
    AFAIK, there is no Unicode requirement to use one or the other. Since you never
    know what the user will do, safest is to have, in the ccmp\r\n\r\nsub i uni0304
    by uni012B\r\nsub uni012B uni0301 by uni012B0301\r\n\r\n(and remember that in
    FontLab, for example, uni0301 might be named \"acutecomb\", in which case the
    second item would be *sub uni012B acutecomb by uni012B0301*)\r\n\r\nwhich covers
    the two ways a user could enter the character. If you have a lot of these though,
    writing the ccmp feature can get pretty complex. See, for example, the ccmp for
    SIL's Charis."

  body: I usually make precomposed glyphs for ones in Unicode and use 'mark' feature
    for the rest, no one complained about 'mark' so far, but fortunately FontForge
    makes it dead simple to build precomposed glyphs based on already in place 'mark'
    anchors so it shouldn't be hard to support 'ccmp' scenario if requested.

  body: "Firstly I was using precomposed glyphs, but this causes very large fonts
    if you plan a wide language support and includes small caps (or, even worse, also
    petite caps and swashes). So I changed my procedure to this:\r\n\r\n<strong>1</strong>.
    I added all precomposed base+diacritic coded in Unicode according to the language
    support.\r\n\r\n<strong>2</strong>. Troublesome combinations, although unencoded,
    are also added as precomposed glyphs to produce proper design. \r\n\r\nFor example:
    open E with ogonek has no codepoint in Unicode. But the ogonek connection is hardly
    good when associating base open E with the 'generic' ogonek, so I made a precomposed
    glyph ([[http://www.typophile.com/node/67787|sample]]). The same with overlines
    and underlines, which length may coincide with base letter width. This is not
    possible combining 'generic' over/underlines with base glyphs and thus I added
    these as precomposed.\r\n\r\nOther tricky diacritics include slash, cedilla, horn
    and hook.\r\n\r\n<strong>3</strong>. Remaining combinations will be done with
    mark/mkmk features and some contextual kerning (which can be set in the mark/mkmk
    code). As this feature is not supported by FontLab 5, it need to be made with
    other tool (as Khaled does) or you wait for FL6.\r\n\r\nTypical candidates for
    contextual kerning are base letters narrower than diacritics, as |f|i|j|l|r|t|.\r\n\r\n<strong>4</strong>.
    Further improvement can be done with variations in combining diacritical marks:
    different glyphs for uppercase and lowercase use, for over and below positions
    and also for stacked diacritics (for example: dieresis and circumflex would be
    combined in a precomposed glyph where their design is changed to get better result)."

    i uni0304 by uni012B\r\nsub uni012B uni0301 by uni012B0301</cite>\r\n\r\nI'd have
    to have my OT code in front to check, but wasn't it possible with <code>ccmp</code>
    to first <em>decode</em> an i_macron glyph first into a 'loose' i and macron,
    then <em>recode</em> them again as <code>i macron acute</code> to get your singular
    glyph \"i with macron and acute\"?"

    But even if you could, you would loose your imacron -- Unless you meant to break
    it apart, do all you combining with other accents, then rebuild it -- which would
    be just as much work.\r\n\r\nAt our shop, we solve the issue by running a script
    on an incoming manuscript, so every Unicode character with a codepoint is so encoded,
    even if the author used combining accents in the manuscript. That means I know
    imacron is already a single character. But a customer using a script isn't something
    a font designer can count on . . . "
