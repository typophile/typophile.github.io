body: "Hello,\r\nI'm looking for a font that suggests architecture:\r\ngeometry, possibly
  visible individual parts/segments like the font Build from YouWorkForThem (pasted
  below). I especially like the way parts of this seem to fold in on themselves, suggesting
  dimensionality without a standard dropshadow/extruded effect.\r\nDoes anyone have
  ideas of other things like this? It can be somewhat idiosyncratic because I'm only
  using it in large display-size headlines.\r\nThanks a lot for any ideas...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BUILD_FONT_3590.jpg]"
