  in circles. I hate designing for myself, because I'm so flipping indecisive. Can
  anyone give me some guidance on any of these logos for me. It's for my freelance
  design business.\r\n\r\nCheers in advance\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "The first one in the second row is the most compelling - it's clean and sharp
    and will adapt well to any application. You could use the jv on its own as a graphic
    device too if you wanted.\r\n\r\nThe first row has that difficulty with the kerning
    of 'vi' which is quite distracting. The other two look unbalanced to me - the
    rounded join in the third row looks forced, and awkward!\r\n\r\n--\r\nAegir"

    stay away from the slab serifs in row 2 - they bring to mind collegiate sports,
    where 'JV' = junior varsity.\r\n\r\nI like row three, because the letters wind
    up looking a bit like a scribble, which fits with creative design. Though I keep
    seeing an N or M in the V.\r\n\r\nThe logos in rows 3 and 4 seem so different
    in personality: which one is more like you?!"

    ways - I like the neatness and even weight of the line in row 3, but then I like
    the hand drawn feel of 4; it just depends on the mood I'm in at the time.\r\n\r\nHow
    do you guys design for yourselfs? I find it a real struggle!"

    group of logos so far. Some slight nitpicking:\r\n\r\n\r\nrow 1: The j and t need
    to be narrowed at the loop maybe? Or maybe eliminate the loop on the t\r\nor cut
    it?\r\nOptically, the t feels like it's too high, like it's tiptoeing on the baseline.\r\n
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jv2_5228.jpg]\r\n\r\nrow 2: classy, could
    work. Or people might perceive Junior Varsity, as mentioned.\r\n\r\nrow 3: the
    V feels wide in relation to the J ... and seems to rise too high to the right.\r\ndifficult
    to decipher JV at first glance\r\n\r\nrow 4: snazzy work on this row, but maybe
    too close to Walden Media?"

    I've cracked it - I'm probably going to go for a variation on the bottom row.
    I'll remove the circle and just have the JV bleeding off the edge of the page,
    business card or whatever. I'll post here when I've done it.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    Junior Varsity comments, I doubt that will be an issue here in the UK, unless
    I go global all of a sudden!"

    a little bit what you mean here? I don't think I'll be dotting the J as I like

    - yup, I like them, and I play guitar too and like Hendrix, hence the spelling.

    longer. It may help as well. Just try out some versions. Maybe some other one
    will work better. If it doesn't, just keep the current one.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
