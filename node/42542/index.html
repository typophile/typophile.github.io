  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Is it just me, or is it always easy to tell when finals roll around in the design schools? I don&rsquo;t mean to point any fingers, but around the time of finals, we get a lot of questions that <em>seem to be</em> looking for answers to term papers, etc.</p>
<p>Now, as a student myself, I appreciate the amount of information presented here on Typophile, as well as the ability to pose a question to professionals in the field. But it seems that aside from James Puckett, myself, and a few other regular contributors, that we&rsquo;re the only ones to do a dang Google search before posting an inquiry.</p>
<p>I think it highlights the importance of two aspects of Typophile:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Typowiki. It's still fairly weak as a useful compendium of knowledge. I think that if we were to regularly update it with relevant information as it is posted, we would be able to answer more frequently asked questions by pointing to the Wiki.
<p>How many times do we have to answer the same questions? What sans goes with this serif? Does anyone have any information on the background of xyz serif?</p>
<p>Using the Wiki more effectively should free up the boards for more topical discussions that matter.</li></p>
<li>Fixing the Typophile hierarchy. There was a post a while back asking for suggestions for improving Typophile. The hierarchy of the layout was brought into question, particularly the back water known as "special interest groups." 
<p>Most of the questions we receive from students could easily fit into the Typographic Education board. Mods could bump them there if they wanted to. But why wouldn&rsquo;t you? Because hardly anyone knows it exists. If that one particular board were brought forward a bit, I certainly think that it could be put to better use.</li></ol></p>
<p>Anyway, don&rsquo;t take it all that seriously. It&rsquo;s just a few thoughts that I know others have suggested as well.</p>
<p>Comments?</p>

<p>But the big problem is just that too many students can’t be bothered to just hit the library. Unless more professors hold class in the library at the start of a project, and require students to provide detailed citations, this is just going to keep getting worse, and wikiality will take over.</p>

<p>Regarding students, this can and should be one branch of their research, but they should know that a lot of the info the smart folks here give out (out of the goodness of their hearts) can be found easily on- or off-line if they are at all resourceful. Again it would be nice to see students making their questions more focused and thought out. I don&rsquo;t like having to come up with dissertation topics for them either.</p>
<p>But then, it is easy to just ignore those threads.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that questions like &ldquo;What is the best font for a hair salon?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are the top 10 fonts?&rdquo; are necessarily relegated to students. A lot of professional graphic designers don&rsquo;t know very much about type, or even care that much.</p>
<p>I think one of the best things about Typophile is that the top people in the field are willing to talk to complete newbies without any condescension. I&rsquo;m sure we can all admit we&rsquo;ve posted dumb questions &ndash; I know I have. I think it&rsquo;s good to know that designers out there are just trying to find more information about type, although there are certainly some questions that seem unforgivable :)</p>

<p>There is something similar in my job. I deal with highly trained technical people, and often they neglect to think about one of the most basic things in their design, because it is sort of taken for granted. Then at the end of their process, they take a look at that area, and find they have to wait 6-8 weeks for parts, and have to scramble for resolution. Thankfully I carved out a living for 30 years being the guy who pulls the rabbit out of the hat. But now the Chinese are taking all the margin out of that area, and I have to diversify.</p>
<p>Most of us are here because we enjoy the creativity and variety of fonts, but for some, they don&rsquo;t keep up on fonts because fonts are taken for granted, and they are focusing on something else, like solving the layout.  (But at the end,  Arial or Times New Roman doesn&rsquo;t look quite right).
