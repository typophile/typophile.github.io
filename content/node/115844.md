  body: "There have been other posts about this company who makes these hand-drawn
    rubber stamps. My opinion is that this work is not a font, but that these stamps
    are made from a hand-drawn original. I think this is at least very similar to
    the script fonts sold by Emily Lime foundry, which are drawn by Emily Connors.
    \r\n\r\nYou can find her work at MyFonts.com. Carolyna is one that shows many
    similarities, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    ;)

  body: "Oooops! Sorry. That was the question before. Not reading, Mike...\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the Emily Lime fonts, like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emily-lime/emmy/?refby=bowfin|Emmy]],
    I see similar numbers and letterforms, just made more casually. If this is her
    work, which is my current theory, this sans serif font is a more polished version
    she uses for the stamp line.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

title: Looking for the font that the address is written in (not the handwritten calligraphy).
  Gorgeous isn't it?
