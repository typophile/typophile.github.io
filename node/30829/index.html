  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I walk outside and the snow settles betwen the bricks, describing a million perfectly white capital "I"s, with gorgeously subtle serifs.  Each of them unique and yet they go together.  

I was playing hockey this morning - and every single cut in the ice felt like lettermaking, lots of "c"s and "o"s and "u"s.

The branches in the park nearby have delightfully light "fs" with sharply invividualized flags, and "ts" with the wispiest of crossbars.

And so on....

Is this a normal reaction to visiting this site and spending time with books on typeface/typography?  

Anyone else experience this?

I wonder if the alphabet came from observing nature?  I remember Robert Graves claiming that the letter "v" came from watching geese. :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes. I've seen it mentioned here and there among posts, or at least hinted at. It is perfectly normal. Okay, I don't really know if it is really "normal", but it happens. The shapes of the letters are very powerful, and the most ungainly are no accident. When you've got them on your brain, their ghosts appear everywhere.

The rest of the time, I think people seem to get sucked into consiously IDing and analyzing the typeface choices of others around them. I was flipping through some CDs, and thinking, "Why don't the labels use more hand lettering?"

O Crikey, Chris, <em>please</em>, not another 12 step program!  Either way they get you:  "I'm not a typophile" (well, then it follows that you <em>must</em> be one, DENIAL!)  "I am a typophile."  (SEE!)

@ Allessandro (lovely name, my nephew has the same), the Boston Atheneaum library here in Boston is ordering Kallir's <em>Sign & Design</em> for me.  Sounds very interesting. Do you know of anything else along those lines?

As for the Katzenjammer handle:  I'm using it in terms of "hangover" - actually, I got the word from the Consul, a central character in <em>Under the Volcano</em>; being no 12-stepper, he was always drunk; and at one point also makes a memorable, if questionable, etymological assertion: that he'll be in "in the cat's pajamas" in the morning...  :-)

Read up on the development of the alphabet. The A is the inverted head of an ox, for example. World Book encyclopedias used to have great articles at the start of each book, explaining the origins of that letter.</div>

I couldn't stop reading it, and I still read it once a year.  It's akin to Joyce's Ulysses in its focus on words/language - I imagine the film is its own and separate thing...

		<div class="commentbody">It's not only seeing type everywhere, it's rather wanting to improve it if you see an not perfect letter. And you pity yourself that you can't...


Last time seeing type: I was playing a downhill skiing computer game, trying to optimize the way through the gates, and all I was thinking of was about beautiful tension of bezier curves...
I'm still 7 seconds slower than the best time, so maybe typedesign is not the very best approach in downhill skiing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm also quite the newbie, but I find myself getting distracted by trying to ID fonts on signs and restaurant menus and the like. On more than one occasion I've temporarily dropped out of conversations or caused delays ordering meals because I was still trying to figure out what font the menu was set in. I was quite gratified when I ran across the following quotation:

<cite>
“I cannot order a meal unless I have identified the font on the menu — drives everyone crazy.” — Erik Spiekermann
</cite>

(Source:

The worst menu I ever saw was set in Adobe Serif MM. Food was OK though.

		<div class="commentbody">There have been a few times I have asked for permission to hold onto a menu after placing an order. Once I got some puzzled stares for taking pictures of a menu. *shrug* I had to know.

Sometimes I make font flash cards from the fonts I have that I can't easily identify, along with some samples from web sites. Or I'll just cut out magazine text/ads with fonts I don't easily know. Then I sit down and begin the drill of running through them and trying to ID them. 

It may sound a little sad and amusing I admit, but in the long run the process has paid back in several ways.</div>
