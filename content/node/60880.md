  through the Adobe pro version and can't seem to find this particular ornament. Is
  it in a different version? anyone know?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Flourish_4389.gif]

    Script Pro]], which has a total of 117 ornaments. \r\nBut I haven't been able
    to view them all, they're a bit [[http://www.parachute.gr/fonts.aspx?Sample=1&id=481&FontStyleID=&FontFamilyID=54&CharacterSetID=74&Page=7|tangled
