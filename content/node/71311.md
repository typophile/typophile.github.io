  here:\r\nWhat are the specifics when designing a typeface for use on (PAL) television?\r\nDoes
  anyone know of a good source of information on this topic? I saw some books on Amazon,
  but their value is not clear...\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDiederik"

    books on the subject - most my my knowledge is from working with guys who've been
    making broadcast ads since before, well, computers.\r\n\r\nSo, take 16pt (on an
    average 1000upm face) as your minimum. With that in mind, any strokes thinner
    than 3pt are going to start to strobe depending on the quality of the TV. So your
    looking for something with strong strokes, and large open counters to stop it
    appearing uneven.\r\nObviously upwards from 16pt and you can get more free, but
    remember the strobing problem still applies even on large sizes.\r\n\r\nI think
    some of the older computer games developers would know more on the subject than
    anything broadcast centric - they've been dealing with complicated interfaces
    and typography for years on PAL, HD has eliminated most of those issues now. Most
    broadcast stuff is big and in CAPS for the reasons above.\r\n\r\nVAG, Gill Sans,
    and Zurich have all had long and fruitful lives on TV. Maybe they hold the secrets..."

  body: "I was a game developer for years and have worked on lots of fonts tuned for
    TV. \r\n\r\nThere's no better way than getting some tv sets and testing. Figure
    out your worst case scenario TV set and set up a video card to output to it. When
    I designed Cinecav, I used a TV which I found on the curb and a few other low
    end sets. I found that the higher end sets didn't give much better feedback than
    a computer monitor. When I worked in games, we didn't have gold standard set for
    testing. Any reasonably shitty TV will do the trick. I never tested in PAL but
    I imagine it would be similar. The resolution is irrelevant because you never
    know what size the font will be scaled to.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for making
    CRT fonts. Some of these rules may apply to plamsa & LCD but maybe not.\r\n\r\nWhen
    dealing with CRT with interlace it's best to avoid thin horizontals. If you're
    doing a serif font, make sure the serifs are beefy enough that they don't cause
    interlace flicker. How beefy? Depends. You have to test the serifs at different
    sizes. Short sharp serifs still flicker but they may not be noticeable. Times
    New Roman regular is an example of too thin/too long. My Byington font is an example
    of serifs that were designed to avoid excessive flicker. Compare with other Trajan
    based fonts which have sharp serifs.\r\n\r\nNear horizontals look like blurry
    horizontals on a CRT. Subtlety in horizontal angles is going to get lost so stay
    flat when possible. Avoid angled ends. Compare Arial to Helvetica on a CRT. Arial's
    ends don't look angled, they just look fuzzy.\r\n\r\nNear verticals? No problem.
    Vertical lines are pretty much just as blurry no matter the angle. Enjoy your
    vertical freedom.\r\n\r\n<em>Phosphor traps</em> are like <em>ink traps</em> or
    <em>light traps</em>. Unlike ink traps, they tend to look best when they're squared
    off. Pop over to http://www.ccfonts.com/ and you can see phosphor traps that are
    really exaggerated. You don't have to go so wild with the phosphor traps but that
    squared trap strategy can shed a few crotch pounds when needed.\r\n\r\nCounters
    fill in like crazy on a CRT so take care and test a lot."

  body: "Yup, what he said. Fine advice.\r\n\r\nAnd obese it is! Learn to love it.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    just to complicate it further,It would also depend on how the font is being outputted,
    your digital programme guide is being rendered by the device, where as things
    like Now/Next/Later would be broadcast and decoded like an image - that will also
    effect the quality.\r\n\r\nMy bad, didn't mean to imply your 16pt needs 3pt strokes,
    but as a rule I try never to let any single lines drop below that mark, for boundaries
    and horizontal rules etc.\r\n\r\n@typodermic, i've wondered how they cope in Japan
    using their alphabet on crappy CRTs - did they just have to make everything huge?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@_leigh the closed captioning on my Toshiba Regra TV set is enormous and
    blazing white. I can't change the font size so it's really irritating. The text
    often covers half the screen so you can't even see the actors through all the
    kanji. My Panasonic phone has a TV with closed captioning . . . it also obscures
    a lot of the screen but it's not as bad. Subtitles in the movie theater are more
    subtle. I've seen a few movies with English audio and Japanese subs. They use
    really thin fonts as not to be so distracting. On DVD, they use reasonably sized
    fonts for Japanese subs. When things get too wordy, they edit the text to fit.
    I notice a lot of dialog gets left out, probably just to make the text fit or
    for simplicity's sake.\r\n\r\nTV variety/talk/game shows have their own \"hard
    subs\". You've probably seen clips on YouTube where certain words are displayed
    in colorful fonts. They started doing that about 15 years ago so now it's expected
    for most variety/talk/game shows. Since they don't subtitle every word, they can
    afford to use huge lettering, often with special effects. If you watch those shows
    with closed captioning, they sometimes leave out the words which are already displayed
    on-screen but sometimes they're duplicated. It's not that consistent. A large
    percentage of talk/variety shows have no closed captioning."

    seriffed type would be a challange on a tv screen. My client still is adamant
    about the serifs though! I picked up the glove (it has been done before, serifs
    on tv, I mean) and hope I can find a fitting solution.\r\n\r\nThanks again for

  body: Serifs can look good on TV. I opted for slab serifs for Cinecav because anything
    thinner caused interlace flicker. Although they weren't designed for the screen,
    have a look at Courier and Officina. Test them on screen and make observations
    . . . I think you can learn a lot from looking at the way print fonts behave on
    screen. Century Schoolbook kind of works on screen. Looking at the way existing
    fonts behave on screen before you start designing can set you on a clearer path.

    now I am exploring slab serif designs, careful not to make the characters look
    too planted & heavy. At the same time I am looking for contrast in shapes & counters
    to keep the letterform open & recognizable in screen resolutions. It's an interesting
    puzzle, which will probably result in an interesting face.\r\n\r\nto be continued..."
