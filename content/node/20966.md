  lost in the fur... pardon, discussion.\r\nI remember seeing this phrase (No revolution
  ever used a serif) on a poster or as a graffiti and I really can't find out what
  it was.\r\nI don't know if it would be worth opening a discussion about revolutions,
  propaganda, regimes and typography, but for sure I'd appreciate any hints who could
  help me find out if I really read it somewhere or I just dreamt about it (which
  of course would be much cooler).\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\nJacopo"

  body: "Absolutely. But we have forgotton what it was about, which was primarily
    unfair taxation with freedom of religion thrown in. We pay a lot more taxes now
    than the original reason for the revolt.\r\n\r\nIncome tax was instituted in America
    as a \"temporary\" measure to pay for World War I. Before that the federal government
    was run on sales tax.\r\n\r\nDaylight savings time was another temporary measure
    instituted in World War I. Both of these temporary measures have stood the \"permanent\"
    test of time\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: ">primarily unfair taxation\r\n\r\nThe saying 'no taxation without representation'
    captures it more accurately. \r\n\r\nWhile overtaxation was a grievance, there
    were many others. The Declaration of Independence says, \"The history of the present
    King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having
    in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. ...A
    Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant,
    is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebellion was equally
    about the 'usurpations' as about 'injuries': They wanted establish self-govenance,
    which the founders saw as necessary to a better and more just society. \r\n\r\nThe
    Declaration of Independence says: \"Governments are instituted among Men, deriving
    their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" It also says that the colonies
    had repeatedly warned England \"of attempts by their legislature to extend an
    unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\" \r\n\r\nIt was because they saw democratic
    self government as the only long term solution to avoiding tyranny and establishing
    a better and more just society that they took up arms in the ultimately successful
    rebellion. \r\n\r\nThe American Revolution is most associated with Caslon typeface,
    as the Declaration of Independence was printed in it for distribution. Benjamin
    Franklin also printed mainly in Caslon, though late in life he championed Baskerville's
    typeface.    "

  body: "Tim, I agree with you that as an assertion it looks more likely to be a manifesto
    than the result of a historical research. It also have to me a sort of Latino-America
    flavor, although I'm lead to think that it was created by an american or european
    mind.\r\n\r\nDavid, I think that \"serif\" in this case might have a metaphorical
    meaning, and that's why I'd like to find the source of it."

    this is really true, Tim? I think that the Protestant Reformation (which did lead
    to several bloody revolutions in late Renaissance Germany, even if only inadvertantly)
    was started by the printed word. It was printing that allowed Martin Luther's
    works to spread so quickly."

    for smaller fires to be fed until they became revolutions... there certainly have
    been many would-be revolutions that in the end just weren't.\r\n\r\nI also tend
    to think that print itself was a revolution, but that is using the word revolution
    in a broader sense than in, say, the French Revolution."

  body: "Well, printing somehow started its own revolution.\r\nItalian historiography
    also uses 1455 to mark the end of Middle Ages and the beginning of Renaissance
    period.\r\n\r\nI was thinking more that it might refer to slogan written on walls,
    which I seriously doubt could be using serifs unless someone from this forum is
    called up to the job.\r\nI find brilliant the idea of having it <em>as an advertising
    slogan for a sans serif</em>\r\n\r\nA curiosity: the equivalent of sans serif
    for Chinese characters (Hei) had his birth from the use of squared brushes to
    write slogans."

  body: I imagine the quote in a contemporary context, where a hand-made protest sign
    is lettered with a blunt brush and amplified over the media. Possibly the meaning
    implies that in an immediate culture, serifs require time, which is a luxury of
    pre-modern-media revolution.
