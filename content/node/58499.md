  body: "When you say \"old\", what time are you talking about? (In other words Kepler
    (1996), for example, may have been developed later than the logo.)\r\n\r\nYour
    image is way too blurry to make an ID, other than a rough guess. Right now I think
    this looks closer to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-expanded/|Century
    Expanded]] than Bodoni.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "WhatTheFont suggested Kepler. Either way, the original typeface was probably
    pre-digital.\r\n\r\nWe're thinking 50s/60s. Closest digital we found was Monotype
    Modern and just modified to match.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input, Mike."
