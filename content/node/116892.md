  from theatrical subtitles used on a movie from 1979. I'm actually working on the
  re-release of this movie, and we're including a restoration of these subtitles as
  an optional subtitle track so people can experience the movie the way it was first
  screened in America. While it's not 100% necessary to find the exact font, something
  really close to this would be nice for when we author the DVD to make it more authentic.
  So please don't hold back if you only have something similar but not exact!"

    are similar to Times New Roman but for subtitles to work you should have a lower
    contrast and a thicker outline.\r\nThis is what Times NR would look like if it
    was made thicker by use of a parallel lines technique.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesWithParallelToBolden_4680.jpg]\r\nOr
    you could forget about matching the letter-forms with a font available in the
    early 1970s and look for a low contrast serifed font that would be thick enough
    to be easy to read on screen.\r\nDon"

  body: "Georgia, designed by Mathew Carter, is about as close as Times New Roman
    and is lower contrast. It would work for the subtitles -- as shown in the top
    example -- and would be fairly easy to read if it was made thicker by use of a
    parallel lines technique -- as shown in the second example.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GeorgiaWithParallelToBolden_3590.jpg]\r\nDon"
