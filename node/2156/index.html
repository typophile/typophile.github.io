<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all, <br> <br>Here's a font that's been vexing me for ages. I only have a scan from a fax copy and want to improve it somewhat. <br> <br>Looks like a form of Bodoni or Century 725 Black from the Corel disk... but the killer is the ampersand (the &). <br> <br>Any ideas? Thanks in advance.<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20934.gif alt="House & Garden logo"></div>

<div class=commentbody>Pistilli Roman. Although it looks like it's been heavied up a bit with ink spread or some outline/shadow treatement. I'll post a scan shortly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey, I don't pick 'em. The fact is, the Phil's book has some <br>of the best samples, and it's fairly comprehensive as of <br>about 1980 for old film fonts. Other books have a broader <br>sampling, but poorer showings. Mine is #573. I still have <br>the receipt for $48 (plus $3 shipping).</div>

<div class=commentbody>What I find most useful is having the groupings of fonts by Categories, such as Ultra Bold (where Pistilli showed up & Egiziano too, from another post), and especially by Serif type. Very Handy. I have a Second Edition version with a $39.95 sticker still on the back. What do you mean that yours is #573?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The inside front cover (it's in a 3-ring binder) has a sticker <br>with my name written in and the number "573/2500" which <br>(I assume) means it's number 573 of a run of 2500. There's <br>also a coupon in the back to put the cost of the book <br>toward the first job I might send to them. I don't know if <br>you remember, but typesetters usually kept track of who <br>had their catalogs for marketing purposes. Those things <br>weren't cheap to produce, I'm sure.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Huh! I didn't realize it was published as a book. I always <br>assumed that everyone had a copy like mine. In addition to <br>the coupon and receipt in the back pocket, it also has a <br>credit application and price list. It's loose-bound in a <br>three-ring binder, so it's easy to take the pages out. The <br>three indexes in the front are saddle-stitched separately <br>and bound in with the other pages. A fairly elaborate <br>package, actually.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Phil's Photo "Homage to the Alphabet" is indeed a treasure. The first edition in a 3-ring binder is beautiful, and is definitely a collector's item. When I still worked at Phil's a couple of years go, they had a small stash left of the first edition. If I recall correctly, they were selling for around $150 each, and there may be a few copies left. Yes, it's more than the later paperback editions you can find second-hand, but the original is just wonderful. I highly recommend it as a Christmas gift (to yourself). <br> <br><a href=http://www.philsfonts.com target=_blank>www.philsfonts.com</a> <br> <br>And no, I am no longer affiliated with Phil's Fonts in any way, I just want everyone to have the joy of owning this book if possible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know much about it, but I don't think it's from any <br>earlier than the late 1960s. I can tell you that it was a VGC <br>font designed by John Pistilli and that it came in three basic <br>weights--normal, bold, and black. The weights appear to <br>refer mainly to the thickness of the hairlines, sort of like <br>optical scaling. There were two other styles--Open No. 1 <br>and Open No. 2--which only differed in stroke thickness.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mark, <br>I just found a site (<a href=http://www.incipit.com/typefaces.html target=_blank> Incipit</a>) that says they have a photocomposition (film type) library of 3,500 faces, including the 4 Pistilli faces. A quick glance at their type catalog listing shows a lot of the Phil's Photo typefaces alive and well in that collection. Makes you wish you had your own Typositor doesn't it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, I found that site a while back, too. Looks like they <br>have all of them. <br> <br>I actually have a dozen old Typositor reels with 60 or so <br>faces on them. They used to belong to the University of <br>Minnesota's Journalism School. I grabbed them when they <br>were going to be thrown out. No Typositor, though. <br> <br>I wanted very badly for a while to have a Typositor in-house <br>when I was a magazine art director early in my career, but <br>they were not cheap and we could never justify the cost. </div>

<div class=commentbody>All of our typositor reels found their way to the dumpster around mid 1995.

<div class=commentbody>The designer was indeed James Hellmuth. He did 99% of the design work for Phil's Photo. Very talanted guy. I've been out of touch with him for years. <br> <br>By the way the catalog ,"Homage", is the first instance I can recall that has a "found typography" or what ever you want to call it.

<div class=commentbody>I've always thought those dividers were a nice touch. <br> <br>There's one photo in there that gets to me now.
