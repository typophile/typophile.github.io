  body: 'what''s with the brown line? Are you trying to emote any type of feeling,
    or style? Right now, it feel very sterile. Honestly, the type choice (Optima?)
    isn''t the strongest for something as simplistic as this.  '

  body: "i agree with Asvetic. the beige vertical seems to call attention to jesus
    alberto and, on the right, the wednesday agenda, without really telling me why.\r\ni
    was also confused as to the differing top alignments for the columned text. i'm
    not saying you didn't have reasoning for it, only that it wasn't apparent to me."

  body: what would happen, for instance, if you lost the hr between columns. is it
    necessary? the gutter already suggests the vertical line anyway. then it might
    be possible to move the biege rule either left or right to serve as a more connective
    element -- almost an echo of the gutter -- for the asymmetry you seem to be looking
    for.

  body: "As above, the varying baselines of the two columns is a problem. Unlike Chuck's
    generous comment, even if you had reason to use different baselines, don't; no
    matter what it's likely to be <em>perceived</em> as an error even if it's not,
    so you're setting yourself up to look sloppy rather than clever (although clever
    is often worse than sloppy).\r\n\r\nAlso ditto on the font: Optima is dead.\r\n\r\nAlso
    ditto on the brown rule; I have no idea what it's doing there, which means it's
    not doing anything there."

  body: "While you are doing those changes you might change United-states, United
    kingdom, Republique Populare of China, Singapor and jesus on one and on the other
    begining, there may be other errors. I think you have loose word spaces affecting
    your right and left ranging text on the righthand layout. The righthand vertical
    rule only seems to be there for the heading to hang off, but it is a stretch to
    imagine that, ultimately I would lose the vertical rules and align the headings
    on one of the other columns.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: yes. i didn't want to get into the spelling/capitalization issues yet, but
    they will have to be corrected. ben might also want to consider a mirrored grid
    to balance the spread...
