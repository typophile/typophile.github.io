  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Photoshop project manager John Nack released a picture of the new Adobe branding system for its software icons on his <a href=http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2006/12/whats_up_with_the_icon.html>blog</a>. He did this because of the many criticisms that erupted when he revealed that the Photoshop CS3 and Bridge 2.0 icons were not placeholders, but rather the planned icons.</p>
<p>In the post, guest writer Ryan Hicks mentions that [[Robert Slimbach]] was heavily involved in the design of the icons, lending a custom version of his upcoming typeface Gauge for the lettering. While the icons are not an ideal place to get a feel for the typeface, I thought that some around here would like what I presume is a &ldquo;sneak peek&rdquo; at Gauge.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the color wheel of new Adobe icons (partial key: Ps=Photoshop, Ai=Illustrator, ID=InDesign, Dw=Dreamweaver, AE=After Effects, Br=Bridge, LR=Lightroom):</p>
<p>![](/images/old-images/adobe color wheel_6281.jpg)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure yet if I like them or not. I&rsquo;m tending toward appreciating the simplicity and emphasis on type, but I did like the feathers/flowers/butterflies of yesteryear.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m actually glad the feathers/flowers/butterflies are replaced by something comprehensive.
Since the main goal of icons is to convey a message in a quick and easy way, the last icons didn&rsquo;t really do their job too well, in my opinion. There was no réal way of telling the difference between the programs, other then learn which icon is which program. But that defeats the whole purpose of an icon, I would say.
I do think the new icons do that a lot better. These almost work like file-extentions, thus making them easier to recognise. And of course that all programs are now integrated in a more uniform shape, also contributes to recognition.</p>
<p>If I <strong>like</strong> the icons, easthetically speaking, I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I immediately thought &ldquo;periodic table,&rdquo; but I like the simplicity of it. I was never a fan of the more abstract recent icons. Pretty, but not very helpful in identifying the application in the dock. The old icons (Botticelli Venus for AI, eye for PS) were okay. The new scheme seems like a variation on Macromedia&rsquo;s scheme (round, single color icons with a letter or two). Come to think of it, Microsoft has been using the letter icon idea forever for Office (though they are consistently unattractive, in my opinion).</p>
<p>I find that I look for color first when looking for an icon in the dock. I&rsquo;ve had trouble finding the iTunes icon since it went from green to blue. There are a lot of blue icons in my dock. Having a nice, big, easy to read letter helps a lot for me, more so than shape or other details. So, I think I am going to like the new Adobe icons, even though they are rather plain.</p>

<p>I do wonder how much of this is the influence of the Macromedia designers who came into Adobe. This new set of icons bears much more similarity to Macromedia&rsquo;s simple circle and letter icons than it does to anything Adobe has ever done.</p>

I would far rather have the letters &ldquo;PS&rdquo;, AI&quot;, and &ldquo;ID&rdquo; than that rainbow razzmatazz of unintelligable schmaltz they use now. If you can&rsquo;t come up with an icon that communicates instantly then use acronyms. The old Pen, Brush, Book thing was way better anyway.

It is assumed that ID CS3 will have a similar interface to PS CS3. I would personally guess that Adobe will also add even more Photoshop-like functionality to ID, past the &ldquo;Photoshop Effects&rdquo; mentioned in the article, but that&rsquo;s just a guess. Of course, I&rsquo;m sure that they saved the whizbangiest features for closer to the release date, so I&rsquo;m still very excited to see what ID CS3 will offer (along with the new AI).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My impressions:</p>
<p>I have tried to keep an open mind, but I immediately thought of the periodic table when I first saw this, and can&rsquo;t get it out of my head.</p>
<p>I have to admit I am not crazy about the icons. I understand they are parts of a whole with the color wheel concept, but individually there&rsquo;s really nothing to them other than type over differently colored gradations. They do nothing to tell me what the software does, and although now I have that understanding, it&rsquo;s confusing to the new kid on the block. Also, I have at times up to 6 Adobe icons in line across my dock, and I really don&rsquo;t want them to be quite so uniform and text-based.</p>
<p>I do like the concept from a simplicity standpoint, also because it&rsquo;s a complete 180 from what they have been doing for the icons in the past, but it&rsquo;s too far removed. Adobe is well known for its polished, user-friendly interfaces. This just seems like a step backwards to me.</p>
<p>I would at least work in some simple art that somehow gives a slight hint at what the program actually does.</p>

<p>The question is: Does an icon, or do icons, convey the message? Thinking of Illustrator&rsquo;s OpenType icons, I am happy that a written explanation pops up when I touch them with the mouse &hellip; As to the logical extreme &ndash; indeed. Funny that you present a PhotoShop toolbar. Still I haven&rsquo;t internalized the meaning of each toolbar icon and find myself searching for a particular function quite often.
&ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; is a myth. Whether highly simplified icon or two-letter identifier &ndash; you have to <cite>learn</cite> what their meaning is.</p>
<p>The only thing I don&rsquo;t understand about the Adobe icons is why it is sometimes UC+SC and sometimes UC+LC.</p>

<p>The logic behind it is more or less simple and consistent: UC+SC is used in compound names — FreeHand (FH), PageMaker (PM), ColdFusion (CF), InDesign (ID), etc. —, and UC+LC is used in single word names — Flash (Fl), Director (Di), Flex (Fx), Premiere (Pr), Photoshop (Ps). Of course, there are exceptions like Illustrator (Ai) and GoLive (Gl), for example. And the rocket-arrow icon is <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo">Apollo</a>.</p>

<p>And about the icons: I could be wrong! Looking down at my Mac menu the icons are all small - I have lots of apps in the doc. Maybe this method will sort these icons from the clutter. But I do think that not availling yourself of shape might be a mistake in icon design. And it will punish people who use too many of the Adobe apps because the distinctiveness of the approach will be diluted. 3-4 icons like this if they are in contrasting colors might be fine but if you had 10&hellip; maybe not so good. They may know that the average user has 5 or something. And you know - we can change the icon in OSX if we want to.</p>

<p>Mark&rsquo;s observation I think pinpoints what is the weakness in an otherwise an excellent design. Just a bit too plain, too cold for the brief. Given that the programs are for visual creativity, it seems to me they ought to have a little more &lsquo;juice&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I run into a lot of color-impaired guys at design school, and once had to fix all of a guy&rsquo;s colors the night before a project was due. Given how many designers who can see color suck at using it, I doubt that even being totally color-blind is a big deal.</p>
<p><cite>If I only had a copy of Beorcana I could start making alternative icons with PANACHE right away! :-) Anybody interested in alt icons here?</cite></p>
<p>Get me a copy of Beorcana and I&rsquo;ll help ;) Hell, I&rsquo;ll do it just to stay busy for the next three weeks—I was planning to do nothing but read over break, but trying to read all these big crazy design books I got for x-mas is killing my neck because I have to sit them on a desk or table and hang my head over to read them! Maybe I should just tilt my drawing table way up and clamp them to it&hellip;</p>

<p>Although I wish I could be more in agreement, I think this is well said. I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile when I saw the &ldquo;runaway rainbow madness&rdquo; and explosion/pollution descriptions. :-)</p>
<p>I was never thrilled with the CS/CS2 icons. I assumed the feather icon for Photoshop CS2 was a vague reference to feathered selections, but that was the closest connection to what the software does that I could make with any of the icons.</p>
<p>I do miss the Venus/Eye icons, as well as the collage imagery on the splash screens that served as an extended vision to the images in the icons (and in my opinion, gave hints as to what one can accomplish with the program). Of course most people here have a very strong understanding of what the tools do and don&rsquo;t need that reminder, but I thought they were imaginative, inspired and quite frankly fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>The new icons won&rsquo;t stop me from upgrading, by any means. :)</p>

<p>Hey, Chris, I said &lsquo;a bit&rsquo; too plain. I wasn&rsquo;t asking for Las Vegas, but just a bit more differentiation, a bit more complexity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Guage&rsquo; looks terrific, but just a few of its letters on a colored square, even with the gradient, seems a bit bland, and to beg for just a bit more spice, IMHO.</p>
<p>By the way the MS Office icons work better in respect of striking a good balance between simplicity and variety&ndash;though they are a bit clunky, as Mark noted.</p>
<p>Edit: Looking again, I think maybe the feeling of bareness comes from putting two letters in a square, which puts a lot of space above and below. If the background were instead a slightly shorter than square rectangle in &lsquo;landscape&rsquo; orientation it might help.  I think there may be some optical illusion effect going on here that needs correcting. The perfect square with the gradient may look taller than it is, and need to be slightly shortened to look right&ndash;look less bare a frame for the text.</p>

<p>I of course thought of the periodic table and think they&rsquo;re being a bit disingenuous to deny that connection/inspiration. My only beef is I don&rsquo;t really get the icons positioning on the color wheel - and how they connect to one another. I had no idea they had this many products to begin with.</p>
<p>Are they really gonna stick with Golive now that they bought Dreamweaver? Does anybody use it? Also, I&rsquo;m a bit bothered by Ai for Illustrator. Of course I get it - that&rsquo;s the file appendage, but it seems inconsistent with the others. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be Il? Or would that be confusing in a sans serif?</p>
<p>Font looks a lot like Meta to me.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p><cite>Are they really gonna stick with Golive now that they bought Dreamweaver? Does anybody use it?</cite></p>
<p>The only people who used GoLive were either not competent enough at web design to realize what a turd GoLive is, or just too cheap to buy Dreamweaver after getting GoLive as a freebie when they paid for Illustrator, Indesign, and Photoshop.</p>
<p><cite>Also, I’m a bit bothered by Ai for Illustrator.</cite></p>
<p>I think that they did that because it&rsquo;s a common abbreviation used outside of Adobe already. I see it here and there in print and online.</p>
<p><cite>Rumor has it GoLive is going to become PageMaker to Dreamweaver.</cite></p>
<p>Care to elaborate? I&rsquo;ve never used Pagemaker, so I don&rsquo;t get the reference.</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t understand why Adobe wouldn&rsquo;t just ditch GoLive. When I&rsquo;ve tried using it GoLive felt more obtuse than XHTML/CSS is to begin with, and the code it generates is even nastier than the mess Dreamweaver turns out. Adobe should just buy Rapidweaver and re-brand it as GoLive CS3 so that CS users who don&rsquo;t want to mess with web coding can still have a nice app for churning out simple pages for hosting photos, portfolios, etc.</p>

<p>A full-time web design position I once held required that I use GoLive simply because that was the software the staff had been accustomed to using. I got the job after showing samples of content I had built previously using Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>While GoLive was not my tool of choice (I preferred Dreamweaver for several reasons), using it was a requirement, and it met their needs just fine. It had nothing to do with any level of competency at web design or me being too cheap.</p>

<p>Not true. GoLive actually has superior site management and planning tools. I know a few designers who start their site in GoLive, then switch to Dreamweaver for the design. Things like external css styles are much easier to manage in GoLive.</p>
<p>But did they buy it for that? Nah. They use it because it came with Photoshop. Otherwise they would have stuck it out with Dreamweaver.</p>
