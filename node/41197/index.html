  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have reached the stage of testing the spacing in the font I am designing, and was happy to find an excellent tool to provide text for that purpose. Elsewhere on Typophile Miguel Sousa has described his <strong>adhesiontext</strong> online tool for generating words using a given set of letters in various languages including Arabic. It is a great resource and should be incorporated into Fontlab!</p>
<p>I installed my new font and set it as the default font in my Firefox browser. <strong>adhesiontext</strong> allowed me to see hundreds of Arabic dictionary words displayed in my font.  My question here is whether there is a way to generate random nonsense words, also of paired combinations of chosen glyphs? A choice of point size would also be a great addition to this tool. Thanks Miguel. <a href="http://www.adhesiontext.com/">www.adhesiontext.com/</a></p>

<p><em>My question here is whether there is a way to generate random nonsense words, also of paired combinations of chosen glyphs?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For that I think you&rsquo;re better off using Tim Ahrens' <a href="http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/generator/">Just Another Test Text Generator</a>. Tim talks about it in this thread <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/32756">http://www.typophile.com/node/32756</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that having fake words is ideal. I think that if you don&rsquo;t use real words you won&rsquo;t get the correct texture and the usual letter combinations for that given language. For example, if you&rsquo;re testing a typeface to be used mainly for setting German, you should make sure that the text content is German, otherwise you won&rsquo;t get the correct frequency of accented and unusual letters (ÄäÖöÜüß), and uppercase letters (in German, nouns &ndash; such as &lsquo;dog&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hund&rsquo; &ndash; all start with a cap letter).</p>
<p>I must say that the text sample delivered by Tim&rsquo;s tool comes pretty close to that desired texture, but still. But then, adhesiontext isn&rsquo;t perfect either as its algorithm doesn&rsquo;t have any considerations regarding the language syntax. I guess that&rsquo;s the trade-off of having random and dynamic text, as opposed to &ldquo;Lorem ipsum&rdquo;-like text or text samples grabbed from Wikipedia, for example, that are static.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A choice of point size would also be a great addition to this tool.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tool was written to be a text generator, not a typesetting tool ;^) (Over time I&rsquo;ve been happily surprised to hear about how people are using adhesiontext) In any case, the whole page will scale when you change the type size of your browser. I hope that works for you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Miguel for your detailed and interesting reply. This is my first font, and was not sure what was the best procedure. I agree with you that seeing whole word-shapes is critical for judging a font, but I was worried that, as in proofreading text, the eye ignores a mistake because the sentence has meaning (reading the text backwards works against this tendency). That is why I suggested random words and the link you provided does that nicely. Oh if in the future you have time, perhaps you can find a way to incorporate diacritical marks (harakat) to the Arabic text in adhesiotext that would make it even more useful.</p>
<p>On the other hand,I do agree with you that real words must be used at some stage. By the way speaking of word-shapes, Arabic has a particular advantage over Latin here, because the majority of the letters have geometrically unique shapes (if the dot pattern is included as a shape element), serving legibility. At first glance a line of Arabic appears untidy compared to Latin type, but words have generally unique outlines. Latin tends to have a generally rectangular word-shape as high as the x with occasional bumps when capital letters, ascenders or descenders occur.</p>
<p>You are right about text size as a browser function.</p>
<p>To help me study kerning pairs I have devised an analog method to quickly test hundreds of pairs of glyphs systematically one against another, and hope to detail images of the method soon. Is there a  digital method, apart from using ready-made class lists?</p>
