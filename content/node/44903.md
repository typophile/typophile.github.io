  place:\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me about the differences (if any) between the Adobe
  version of Berthold Baskerville Book and the BQ version? I\u2019m currently using
  the Adobe (for book text, 11/15), but I need OsF and real small caps, so I want
  to buy the expert fonts that include them. I\u2019m wondering if I should just buy
  the expert add-ons, or whether the BQ version of the rest of the font would be worth
  it, too. I\u2019m wondering, is the kerning any better? Are there additional ligatures?
  Also, I find the em-dash on this font to be quite small. My proofreaders mistake
  it for an en-dash, and I\u2019ve had to swap out the em-dash for another font. I
  wonder if it\u2019s any bigger in the BQ version.\r\n\r\nI tried emailing the US
  Berthold vendor, but they don\u2019t respond.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nHeather"

    <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-77-baskerville-10-cyrillics\">Baskerville
    10</a> sets nicely.\r\n\r\nAs for Adobe vs BQ, I do like the BQ version at smaller
    sizes, but the emdash is actually smaller in the BQ cut."
