body: I was digging through some old Type ID threads and saw this typeface that donshonttype
  had posted. Does anyone know what typeface this is or what it is derived from? I
  suppose donshonttype would know best.

  body: "The base font for this lettering is CastleType's Latin CT, and uses a blend
    of the condensed width [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LatinCTCondAsClot_5953.gif]
    and regular width [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LatinCTAsClot_6653.gif]\r\nCastleType's
    products are well make and worthy of purchase.\r\nThrough an oversight I did not
    mention the foundry in my earlier post. Here is a link to the fonts https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/\r\nThe
    spurs are added to demonstrate the ease of making something similar to the \"Bowery\"
    style of lettering that Nike has used for its clothing http://typophile.com/node/103278\r\nHave
    fun making your own version. \r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: Great, thanks donshottype. Looks like you did a fair bit of tweaking to make
    your sample. Nice work!

  body: "Thank you Tylor for the kudos.\r\nThe result seems to be successful as a
    Latinate serif with spurs, but I find the spiky tone of the resulting design to
    be somewhat aggressive and appropriate mainly for bikers, angry rock bands and
    the ilk.\r\nWhen the same spurs are used on a font with a softer serif treatment,
    such as a plush fish tail Tuscan, the effect is more of an ornamented space filler
    that producdes a font that has a tone suitable for applications from stock certificates
    to restaurant menus. The spurs might also work for a similar wide range of applications
    if it is used on font with a Clarendon or thick slab serif.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks Don. I'm actually quite intrigued by the sharp angular serif typefaces
    found in Latin CT and an example from the last link you posted (Dan X. Solo's
    Olympian). I think they would make good candidates for a spur transplant. What
    would be some good keywords to search for those kind of typefaces?
