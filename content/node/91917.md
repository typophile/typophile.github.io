  body: Even though it's quite well executed, you need something to make it stand
    it out more. As it is, it's just one of the many.

  body: "I assume the unbalanced 3 is an accident of inattention.\r\n\r\nThe top bowl
    of B may need to be pulled in just a little.\r\n\r\nThe $ seems heavy to me. For
    any further scrutiny of stroke weight, we'll need a closer look, such as in a
    pdf, preferably with some text set."

  body: "I agree with Jasper. The good news is I think you're already leaning towards
    the necessary individuality: massive x-height. So I would try pushing that a little
    further, probably by shortening the descenders.\r\n\r\nYour caps are nicely proportioned;
    with a large x-height you can (and probably should) make them as high as the ascenders
    (where usually they should be shorter).\r\n\r\nThere are many tweaks I would make,
    but the one that stands out the most is the \"g\": make the descender curve flatter,
    to match the overall style\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your replies. \r\n\r\nI agree that it may need a little more
    personality \u2013\_was afraid to go too far with it, but I will try pushing it
    further. The B has been giving me trouble all along. I'll try to pull in the top
    bowl and see if that helps any. The 3 looks terrible \u2013\_will work on it.
    \r\n\r\nThank you much for your thoughts. Will post my tweaks this evening. \r\n"

  body: "I love how you've used superellipses -- you've done a fine job with one of
    my favorite shapes. Your optical corrections are also great. The basic character
    is good; please push it further! Still, legibility is the most important thing,
    and you've got that.\r\n\r\nThe B is an issue; I think both bowls are out a bit
    too far, but especially the top. As for the 3, it just doesn't fit. Maybe you
    could try a flat top, less of a complete curve, and/or a shorter midbar? Or maybe
    used a superellipsis with the 3 -- it really does look out of place with the letters
    -- but then you'd have to apply that to the other numerals (which might not be
    such a bad idea, since it'd make your face more distinctive).\r\n"

  body: "So you've decided to make it <em>more</em> conventional? If this is intended
    as a learning experience, that makes sense; but it will be even harder to sell.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case the PDF is revealing two important technical issues:\r\n- It seems you've
    made the horizontals and verticals mathematically equal... which makes the former
    appear thicker!* This is a cornerstone \"optical illusion\" in type design. Look
    how out-of-whack the \"L\" and the \"O\" look.\r\n- Your vertical proportions,
    your color and your spacing are each pointing at different point sizes. Do you
    know what kind of applications you'd like to address with this design? Your original
    chunky x-height made a direction easier to find - now it's less clear to me.\r\n\r\n*
    A cool quote from Fiona Ross's presentation in Yerevan in June: \"If you want
    things to look the same you have to make them different.\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Do you have old versions saved? Because it looks like you've tweaked almost
    all of the life out of it. Not only are the rounder curves boring, but they are
    lumpy all over the place (inside not matching outside) because you tried to make
    them by editing something completely unlike them.

  body: "hmm, thanks for the input y'all. I'm hoping you can help shed some light
    on some of your comments as I'm still trying to wrap my head around some things.
    \r\n\r\n- You both mentioned the lack of 'character' on the design. I'm assuming
    you're both reacting to the same thing? (Rounder corners on the O's vs. the more
    squared corners of previous rounds?) My reasoning was that I was afraid it would
    start looking too much like Eurostile \u2013\_but it seems I took it way too far.
    What are your thoughts? \r\n\r\n-  hrant: you mentioned the vertical and horizontal
    stems being mathematically equal. They're actually different, but not by much.
    I will correct - thanks for pointing that out. \r\n\r\n- As far as what the application
    of this face will be, I'd like for it to be a text face \u2013\_something that
    sets well between 9 \u2014 14pts (which is why I went with the taller x-height
    and open counters). Could use any pointers on how to correct it to match that
    usage better. \r\n\r\n- cerulean: you mentioned the rounder curves not matching
    inside/outside. Could you be more specific? I'm not sure I understand the comment.
    \r\n\r\nThanks y'all. \r\n\r\ndm\r\n"

  body: "Line & circle fonts are a dime a dozen, and are very 20th century. Squarish
    circle fonts (like your original was) aren't exactly rare these days, but at least
    they have a contemporary feel. Your initial design also enjoyed a bit of distinctiveness
    in its very large x-height. Even with those good attributes (which the new version
    has lost) such a design will need help getting noticed, possibly via a large number
    of weights, interesting OpenType features or tantalizing pricing.\r\n\r\nYour
    target range of 9 to 14 is too broad - and my view is that fonts that can work
    for text above 12 point need to have an unusually small x-height (which could
    actually be a distinctive feature). If you want to shoot for the bottom of that
    range the proportions are fine, but the color needs to be a bit darker and the
    spacing significantly looser. If you want to shoot for around 12 point I think
    your color is light but OK, but the spacing needs to be looser.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: In a lot of places, particularly C/G/O/Q, you're getting heavy corners because
    you rounded the inside more than the outside. And, in general, from glyph to glyph
    it looks like you can't decide just how square or round the strokes are to be,
    and the differences do not look deliberate in the fullest sense of having a reason.
    I was reluctant to point out specific things, because that would be prompting
    tweaks on top of tweaks, which would only have you drifting further away from
    consistency and the big picture. The first design was drawn much better, presumably
    because you wanted it to look like that. If you want to make a basic Swiss grotesk
    (and if that's what you want to do, I won't discourage you from it quite as much
    as Hrant would, though it is self-evidently true that the world will not beat
    a path to your door for it), you need to start by drawing the strokes you want
    to see, not hammering them out of a different design, leaving artifacts of it
    here and there.

  body: "thanks y'all. Truly appreciated. \r\n\r\nYou are both 100% correct that I
    have had trouble deciding just how square/round those corners should be, and until
    you pointed that out, I was having trouble understanding why the font wasn't feeling
    quite right. \r\n\r\nAs far as the overall design, I am attempting a very subtle
    balance between round/square which I'm obviously failing at \u2013 but no, I'm
    not going for a lot of personality. \r\n\r\nI will make some changes and post
    progress, but if you have any additional thoughts, please send them my way. I
    am learning tons from your feedback. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\ndm\r\n"
