  body: "This was designed by the very talented Jessica Hische: [[http://jessicahische.com/illustrategizes/for-the-benefit-of-kittens-and-doggies]]\r\n\r\nIn
    the description of the project, Hische mentions that it required \"a ton of hand-lettering,\"
    so it may be tricky to find matches. You could always email the designer and ask
    her directly."
