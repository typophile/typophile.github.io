  body: "Yes. Should I stop looking? I think it's in my 1 TB back-up drive. Worst
    case I could go to the garage and dig up that old beauty again. Although my old
    RDC-7 (that has the killer 1 cm macro = 2000+ dpi capability) has been dormant
    for a while now and might not appreciate being awakened.\r\n\r\nI did find this
    \"open-air\" scan though:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg\r\nBut
    I think I have a shot of a non\u2014filed-down \"A\" (by itself) as well.\r\n\r\nSee
    also the images in the second page of this classic thread*:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/1083\r\n(The
    \"tetterode.jpg\" file is no longer linked there though.)\r\n\r\n* Featuring two
    dead masters.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hmm. If it\u2019s a lot of trouble, don\u2019t bother. Pascal is quite nice,
    btw. \r\nI\u2019m planning to use the image in a magazine: right page, portait,
    full bleed. "

    If I do go to the trouble of taking a fresh shot* should I do that one instead?\r\n\r\n*
    Or would an open-air scan be better? What's the minimum dpi?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
