    about but I know the company who designed PPP's stuff. This design firm worked
    almost exclusively in CorelDraw. I recall them using Corel's Grizzly (a Bitstream
    Font) not Kabel. Grizzly is similar to Kabel.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-grizzly/"

    like Kabel might still be the best bet, unless you already own ITC Grizzly."
