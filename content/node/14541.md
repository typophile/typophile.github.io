body: I have few skills in design and type (but a lot of interest), and I'm trying
  to design an attractive resume for an out-of-college full time job in the ibanking
  arena. Can someone suggest a hot template (I know that's a taboo word) or maybe
  a font that would look good at a size below 12? I have to fit everything on one
  page, naturally, and this is one of those situations where you aim to impress with
  content and not style while still standing out. Would you suggest serif or sans
  for body?

  body: "I would suggest discussing your content first. You have to remember culling
    down the vast number of r\xE9sum\xE9s a potential employer recieves, means its
    a quick read and not a lot of detail. Its about organizing the information. Once
    you make the cut, then the interview process is the game maker or breaker. This
    is not a project that you need a lot of design, but a lot of layout."

    body: Thanks Dan. The reason I'm trying to go with a more appealing design is
      that, in some cases in my school's resume submission process, it's harder to
      make the initial cut (to get interviewed) than to get the job.

  body: Keep a serif for the text because there is likely to be a lot of it. Mix it
    with san serif subheads and try to make some white space in the document, in other
    words don't smoosh everything together. What typefaces were you thinking of using?
