  specialising in digital design and have an assessment that I need to get feedback
  on from other designers. I'm still very new to this but here goes nothing! \r\n\r\nThe
  main objective for the assignment was to create a shirt and poster for the Salvation
  Army that can be ordered online; it should showcase their efforts to help and show
  compassion towards others. I designed my shirt to aim at a broader audience, whereas
  the poster is intended to show the effort the salvation army has made since 1865.
  \r\n\r\nPlease! Any kind of negative/positive feedback would be greatly appreciated!\r\nThank
  you so much!\r\nBen. \r\n\r\nPS. I don't know how to change the size of the image,
  I know that it is too big to see so I have attached copies below. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SALVATIONPOSTER_5450.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DraftSalvosShirt_5259.jpg]"

    Army, my impression is that many of the volunteers are rather conservative and
    traditional people. So while I like that the t-shirt is taking a different approach,
    I'm not sure it would appeal to them, unless you are trying to attractive a different
    type of volunteer.\r\n\r\nRegarding the poster, I like vintage images, but are
    there any where the volunteers look happier? They look like they're on their way
    to a funeral. (I hate to admit this, but I've sometimes used the Liquify filter
    in Photoshop to make changes to people's expressions, like to give them a subtle
    smile. But I'd hate to tamper with a vintage photo that way.) \r\n\r\nAlso I'm
    not clear what the poster is trying to do. Get donations? Volunteers? Increased
    public attention? I think it needs a call to action to clarify what you want folks
    to do. I might also experiment with combining the vintage photo with another image,
    maybe something more modern. I don't care for the type treatment, but I'd concentrate
    more on the concept at this point. "

  body: "Hi Ben!\r\n\r\nWelcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nI am an in-house designer for
    The Salvation Army, at their headquarters in Melbourne, so I have a bunch of experience
    working on Salvo designs.\r\n\r\nFirstly, is your brief aimed at getting more
    donations? If not, what is the goal?\r\n\r\nIn terms of Salvo style, it varies.
    Lots. Some things are very conservative, traditional etc, others are more progressive.\r\n\r\nFor
    shirts, probably the best place to see some very popular designs is: Wardrobe
    at http://www.tsa-wardrobe.com - those guys have engaged some super talented designers
    from a round the world to help with the shirts, so there is lots of great stuff
    there. \r\n\r\nDepending on what the goals of the assignment are, one of the popular
    slogans here in Australia for advertising etc is \"Thank God For The Salvos\",
    not that you have to use it or anything, but just so you are aware. \r\n\r\nIn
    Australia we have two Territories, each with it's own website and communications
    department. \r\n\r\nhttp://salvos.org.au & http://www.salvationarmy.org.au\r\n\r\nTake
    a look over the websites to get a feel for the current styles used for public-focused
    communications.\r\n\r\nIn terms of your designs, I feel the historical image is
    not very engaging, maybe try finding a more contemporary way to communicate the
    idea of 'Earth's Angels\" that relates to some of the current ways The Salvation
    Army is helping people. \r\n\r\nGood luck, I look forward to seeing how you progress
    with this :-D"

  body: "Not to put you on a specific path, but if you're seeking to speak to a larger
    audience, why not take a modern approach? You can still use some old images to
    give it a nostalgic and perhaps even a euphoric feeling (I'm thinking of Monty
    Python, but less wacky), but perhaps you ought to think of it as a brand that
    needs to speak to a lot of people. The wings are quite specific in style and exclude
    a lot of people already, though I do like the idea of using wings. Be careful
    not to make it look pretentious though.\r\n\r\nA red background and a friendly
    looking sans serif (something like Gloriola perhaps) may put you on the right
    track. Certainly try to limit the amount of typefaces you use to two. Their logo
    also feels outdated, though perhaps you do need to refer back to when they were
    established, but I'm not sure you ought to do that with typography that is not
    of this time, as it excludes a lot of people."
