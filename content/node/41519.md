body: "Updating the look of a Wedding magazine. After using a combination of Sloop
  and Garamond for years, I thought it was time for a change. Settled on P22 Zaner
  for the script for titles and headlines, great ligatures and extended character
  sets, this is what drew me to Sloop. \r\n\r\nI had hoped to find just the right
  Sans Serif font to complement Zaner. Trying to find a family with the strong character
  and versatility of Neutra. Neutra is being used quite a bit by another publisher
  in the same region, so that is out. \r\n\r\nIn some other threads, there is mention
  of Seria and a few others, but none have really clicked. "

  body: "Stephen, thank you\r\n\r\nBefore flipping back to check for replies, I was
    on the Font Bureau site reading about Relay. Knowing the history of work by Edward
    Johnston and Eric Gill, applying humanistic proportions and shapes to the geometric
    sanserif, defines why I like Neutra and what I am looking for. I agree, it is
    close to Neutra but this helped a lot.\r\n\r\nAlso from the Font Bureau, I like
    one of their new faces\u2026Antenna\r\n\r\nPriori Sans and Parisine are also very
    nice.\r\n\r\nthanks again"

    a bit grotesque like<a href=\"http://vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/\">National</a>.
    or if you really are set on something similar to Neutra, I might like <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html\">Proxima
    Nova</a>. I'd almost be tempted to try <a href=\"http://joshuadarden.com/shop/omnes.php\">Omnes</a>,
    but that may be pushing it a bit too much for a magazine?\r\n\r\nPlease keep me
    in the loop with this project. As the designer of Zaner, I'd much like to see
    the final product. Thanks!"

  body: "I hesitate to mention, if you haven't already realized for yourself: If Neutraface
    is ruled out because it's being used by another publisher, then you should know
    that <cite>Brides</cite> magazine uses Relay extensively. I hate to make the case
    against Relay, since it's a great magazine sans. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, <cite>The
    Knot</cite> uses Jeremy Tankard's Bliss, which is another Gill-ish sans.\r\n\r\nIf
    you haven't already, you might take a look at Verlag (from H&FJ: www.typography.com.)
    A similar character to Neutraface, it might be a sympathetic companion to Zaner
    because of the relatively small x-height and long extenders.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for all of the replies and suggestions. I can only hope to get
    the combination right and do justice to Zaner. Knowing its designer is watching\u2014the
    pressure is on!\r\n\r\nKent, thanks for the heads up on Relay and Bliss. Relay
    seems to have a great range and personality. Wondering if there is room to work
    with Relay, without copying or appearing ignorant of its use in the industry.
    \r\n\r\nEven though Neutraface is a large family, many layouts I see seem to gravitate
    to 3 or 4 faces. Suddenly it seems to be everywhere. Rightfully so, it is also
    a great font. Just curious, was it the use in House and Garden that has pushed
    it to the tipping point?\r\n"

  body: "If you're keen on using Relay, by all means don't let me discourage you.
    I think there are plenty of overlaps in the wedding magazines market. <cite>Brides</cite>
    uses Relay with a mix of other faces. If you use a different mix, Relay could
    feel quite different. \r\n\r\nI would suggest you pick up a copy and take a close
    look at what weights and styles they're using. My recollection is that they tend
    to favor the Condensed styles for headlines. You could try leveraging a different
    aspect of the family and thereby get a different look.\r\n\r\n-- K."
