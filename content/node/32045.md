  but it seems more\r\nrounded, compact, and 'heavy'. I've tried using the Serif Font
  Identification Guide but did not find a match.\r\nThe book is a 1997 reprint of
  a 1971 edition of Michel Foucault's 'Madness and Civilization'.\r\nHope someone
  can at least give me a pointer.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

    Not sure what the Caps.jpg is though. It's Caslon-esque."

    body: I agree, I think the caps are Caslon. The text itself strikes me as some
      kind of mongrel between (especially) janson and caslon - but I love the font.

    it's the URW. I'm guessing maybe the Berthold Janson Antiqua, but I haven't looked
    at all your samples yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes, the italic f is giving me problems too. I was hoping some of the other
    Kis fonts might show the difference, but so far I haven't seen it. The chin on
    the G and the oddly splayed M and the drooping 'g' ear are Kis/Janson hallmarks,
    so I still don't think this is Caslon.\r\n\r\nYou say that the book is a reprint
    of a 1971 book. I wonder if they used the old plates, and that this is a metal
    version of the type.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Your caps sample shows a different typeface than the text samples. I agree
    that the A, in particular, looks like Caslon. Now I wonder if the italic is from
    a third face?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I have found some old versions of Caslon that have a similar italic f by
    looking in the McGrew book of metal typefaces. I believe the italic is some sort
    of Caslon which I have not been able to match across the board.The italic A in
    your sample also has the Caslon 'notch' at the apex, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: "Yes, it's quite possible that it's a metal face. It certainly looks 'uneven'
      like a metal impression.\r\nEDIT: By the way I've discovered the italic 'f'
      is more or less identical to Sabon. More mystery."

  body: The roman looks much like Bitstream's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kis/kis/testdrive.html">Kis</a>,
    or at least whatever source they used for the digitization. The italic matches
    to some degree, but that f looks like it's out of place -- if it's metal, perhaps
    they used an f from another font? Not sure why they would...

  body: "It's metal Linotype Janson. The oddness of the italic f's is characteristic
    of that technology, which did not allow any part of letters to extend past the
    boundaries of the matrix (unlike Monotype).\r\n"

  body: "That seems to be absolutely right. I have a Linotype catalog from the mid-30's
    and sure enough, the italics match your samples. It does show that they had 'one-letter
    italics' that included a more conventional italic 'f', but the basic italic is
    the same as your samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
