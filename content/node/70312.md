body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI've been browsing these forums now and then for some time,
  though this is my first post.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone can answer some questions
  about licensing in regard to creating diacritics while using various fonts. And
  any other advice that might be relevant to my situation.\r\n\r\nI'm part of a small,
  amateur volunteer team publishing Buddhist books for free distribution, and we're
  in the process of choosing a typeface with which to reset a relatively large library
  of previously-published books (about 30 titles, if it works out in the end). We
  need a serif typeface which is robust and versatile, as well as beautiful in an
  unassuming way. And we need to be able to use Pali diacritics, which include glyphs
  such as dots above and/or underneath letters such as m, n, l, t, etc. We have pretty
  much ruled out Gentium, for its lack of typographic features such as OSF and small
  caps as well as in-built kerning etc.\r\n\r\nWe had chosen Arno Pro, which has some
  of the needed diacriticals already, and as far as I understand it Adobe's EULA allows
  us to create the ones we don't yet have, even by inserting new characters into the
  relevant unicode places.\r\n\r\nBut for various reasons we'd now like to go with
  Monotype's Albertina or Albertina Pro (OpenType). However, I can't easily see from
  the  EULA (which I'm having trouble interpreting) whether they allow us to create
  diacriticals either through inserting characters into the unicode slots \u2013 as
  far as I can tell this is not allowed \u2013 or by programming a special kerning
  script to create the diacritics that way (without modifying any of Monotype's font
  software). We're using LaTeX to do this, and it's worked well with Arno Pro.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if Monotype allows us to do this with Albertina?\r\n\r\nThanks very
  much,\r\nJB\r\n\r\n"

  body: Using kerning to position diacritics marks is a really messy method, because
    kerning affects all subsequent glyphs. You not only shift the mark over a preceding
    letter, but then need to shift the following letter away from the mark in order
    to restore the original spacing, and in order to do that correctly you need to
    factor in whatever kerning might exist between the two letters. [This is why OpenType
    GPOS mark attachments exist, and why GPOS kerning treats marks as transparent.]

    Rather, the idea is to create virtual font and metric files that compose the needed
    glyphs on the fly. Additional kerning, ligature rules and glyph positioning are
    all achievable in TeX through this method. The term \"kerning script\" may have
    been a misleading way to describe this."

    I've wondered if it might not be the other way around: that creating unicode characters
    within the font could be more useful in the long run than by coding on the fly
    in LaTeX. That the font itself will be more portable being able to use it in applications
    other than TeX-based ones such as InDesign or even Pages or OpenOffice with new
    diacritics intact? And also that as digital standards progress, the likelihood
    of search engines or ebook formats being able to recognize/look for a greater
    range of unicode glyphs increases? \r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Hudson wrote: <cite> Using

    think I shouldn't have described it this way. We have InDesign which we could
    use for this project too, though LaTeX may be preferable, with its coding abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nUli,
    thank you for the links. We're aware of the palladio/palatino option, and have
    used it in the past. It's robust, good looking and has been used very heavily
    in Pali Buddhist publishing. Bhikkhu Pesala has done great work with his typefaces
    too. And there's Gentium. So, I'll keep all that in mind. We're looking now for
    a heavily-tested and complete OpenType font other than Palatino, and Albertina
    seems to be the current contender.\r\n\r\n"

    with respect to another, there is of course no need to modify the font itself.
    But there may be syntactical issues if any use of the files is to be made later.
    While it is no problem (with TeX) to position a period beneath a letter -- m,
    n, r, etc., the character you have placed is probably the period, U+002E. It will
    look fine. But the correct character is probably U+0323 (COMBINING DOT BELOW).
    So anybody who tries to extract your text for further use will have some cleaning
    up to do.\r\n\r\nSame with the macrons -- you'll likely wind up having to use
    U+00AF for both the macron above and the macron below, instead of the more syntactically
    correct U+0304 (above) and U+0331 (below).\r\n\r\nI'd doubt the Monotype font
    has any of the combining diacriticals, 0300-036F."

    any limitations involved in going down this route, that is using LaTeX macros
    (I guess that's what our guy's doing) to position diacritics on a font which lacks
    them. I'm not up on the technical mechanics of how TeX works and how fonts are
    handled in various applications, but I had reservations when I first heard the
    plan, based on the knowledge that we will want to use the texts involved in future,
    and not always using TeX applications to do so.\r\n\r\nWe will also want to export
    the texts to various formats intended for various purposes: in addition to print-ready
    PDFs we can use for offset or digital (print-on-demand) print runs (which we're
    hoping to produce from LaTeX), we will make versions available to people to download
    as (ideally searchable) PDFs, ebook formats, even possibly html. The current idea
    is to keep the master (most currently corrected) versions of each text as plain
    text files, which can then also be used by people unable or unwilling to use LaTeX.\r\n\r\nI
    realize of course that non-TeX applications will not recognize the macros and
    so lack the diacritics. Therefore our man plans, as I understand it, to create
    another TeX macro to replace the diacritics-creating macro (if that makes sense)
    which instead places the proper unicode characters into the plain text for the
    master files. I'm not sure I got that right, but it's something like that.\r\n\r\nSearchability
    seems to be another misty swamp regarding diacritics in digital text.\r\n\r\nThanks

    or unwilling to use LaTeX.<cite>\r\n\r\nMakes perfect sense. And of the current
    standards, the one you can expect to last the longest and be covered by the most
    software, is Unicode. The decision to use a particular font, just like the decision
    to use a particular layout program, is something for the individual people in
    your group to resolve.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't know LaTeX, I do know plain TeX. What
    you want to do is pretty simple with TeX, with a \"let\" and a definition. AFAIK,
    it is not do-able with InDesign. With ID, you need the correct characters & glyphs,
    and the OT features that will let it all work.\r\n\r\nBTW, The dot-below, and
    macron-below for the Latin transliteration of most Indic Scripts do exist as precomposed
    Unicode characters, in Latin Extended Additional. Of course, most fonts don't
    have these either. And as sure as the Great Ground of Being made little green
    apples, you are going to run into something that requires you to make up some
    character or glyph. Now you need permission from the foundry.\r\n\r\nModifying
    Adobe fonts is one obvious solution. Do note that if you pay strict accordance
    to the license, the number of copies of the font you are allowed is another issue.\r\n\r\nRemember
    too that you can't work on Arno in Fontlab, at least, until FL6 comes out, or
    you're willing to redo all the kerning, and change any *mark* and *mkmk* features
    to a *ccmp* feature. Other font editing programs may not have this limitation.\r\n\r\nSince
    you are going to have to do some font work in any case, why not consider Gentium,
    and do the necessary work? Kerning, small caps, etc."

    we don't have anyone who actually knows how to do font work(!) I have presumed
    that creating the characters we need that are missing from the font (relatively
    few in Arno Pro, basically adding the dot below a few consonents) will be possible
    to do for us amateurs \u2013 somehow. But doing a whole lot more for Gentium ...
    I guess it seemed that Gentium is unfinished at the moment, and when they've got

    I'll ask our man about it all.\r\n\r\nDo either of you know about how diacritical

    standards seem to be going regarding ebooks as well other digital formats? It's
    a big question for us about how to enable search for the words with diacritics.
    I'm assuming there is a movement to adopt Unicode recognition among all platforms
    as time goes on, but that's just a guess.\r\n\r\n"
