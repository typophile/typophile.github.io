  of type fanatics have asserted themselves in the public arena. \r\n\r\nStanding
  in front of the Washington monument, Chris Lozos has announced he will be running
  for President. When asked why he said that he hasn\u2019t heard a single pun from
  any of the other candidates in either party. Challenged on his qualifications, Chris
  argued that anybody could do better than the current guy. \r\n\r\nIn a related development
  Hrant Papazian has been annointed King of Armenia. King Hrant\u2019s first act was
  to declare that there will never be another election in Armenia, as he intended
  to save his country from the pitiable fate of Los Angeles, California. \r\n\r\nIn
  Beirut, Lebanon, John Hudson announced his conversion to Islam, and has been appointed
  chief negotiator to reconcile Hezbollah and the government of Israel. Speaking through
  a translator, Hudson explained that Arabic is much more elegant than his former
  Church\u2019s blackletter, and the Lebanese food is much better than the English
  fare he is used to. The government said that for anybody who can draw both Arabic
  and Hebrew, the negotiation ought to be easy. \r\n\r\nSimon Daniels, at Microsoft,
  reported these developments on his \u2018Type News\u2019, but added that they don\u2019t
  matter, as the nation-state is finished, and actually Bill Gates rules the world. "
