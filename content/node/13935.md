    it's time for TypeCon, it's time for Stephen's birthday. I should realize this
    by now.\r\n\r\nI've been out all day wandering around Brooklyn. I would stop by
    to say it in person, but now I think it's probably too late. (Too late for me,
    anyway.)\r\n\r\nCheers..."

  body: Happy birthday to a fabulous type geek! A bunch of us had the pleasure of
    enjoying a picnic in my hotel room, complete with cake, in honor of the day of
    Stevie C's birth. There were hugs, pinches, and some tasty beverages. Can't wait
    to see everyone tomorrow (today) at the Roosevelt bar around 8pm! Everyone buy
    Stewf a cocktail - he's so adorable when he's tipsy.
