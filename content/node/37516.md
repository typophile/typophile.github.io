  Optima Nova; preferably light or regular.  Does anyone know if this is possible
  anywhere ?  Thanks for any advice/suggestions.\r\n\r\n"

    I wasn't able to find anything other than collections. [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=optima+nova|MyFonts]]
    has the regular weight on a collection CD with some other fonts for about $600.
    [[http://www.linotype.com/58171/optimanovacdformacosandwindows-cd.html|Linotype]]
    only offers it as a complete family, and I think they are the exclusive distributor.
    I ended up just buying the opentype version of Optima from [[http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=AD00197112OT&start=1|Phils
    Fonts]], but of course you can't get the new italic nor the light version. You
    might try emailing Linotype.\r\n\r\nEron"

  body: "It's my understanding that Linotype's strategy with the \"Platinum Editions\"
    is that they only be sold as packaged families. Hopefully [[Dan Reynolds|Dan]]
    will stop by and confirm or deny this.\r\n\r\nFrom a font seller's perspective
    I understand the desire to sell packages over singles. It makes a lot of sense
    both financially and logistically. And the customer often benefits as well in
    the long run. The rub: when the packages are this large and above a certain price
    point it becomes prohibitive to a big chunk of the buying population. I think
    a good compromise is to offer usable subsets of the full family."
