body: "Fontlab Ltd. has just announced a new, more affordable, licensing program for
  students. Students (or faculty) at colleges and universities can now purchase licenses
  for our font editing applications valid for one year (renewable) at less than 25%
  of the retail price. Specifically, the prices of the 1-year student licenses are:
  FontLab Studio: <strong>US$119</strong>, Fontographer: <strong>US$79</strong>, TypeTool:
  <strong>US$23</strong>. \r\n\r\n\u201CGiven that there is now a broader range of
  font editing tools available on the market, we believe that we should offer students
  an opportunity to purchase licenses for our products at an even more affordable
  price than before. We believe that during the course of one year, students should
  be able to learn to work with the tool(s) of their choice and finally pick the tool
  that will best serve their specific needs.\u201D \u2014 Adam Twardoch, Fontlab Ltd.\r\n\r\nMore

    they continue teaching more than 5 years. Is there a cap on total payment by the
    annual fee, or does it just keep going at $119 per year?"

  body: "Adam,\r\n\r\ncharles_e asks a good question. \r\nAnd I'm very glad to see
    this move in pricing - even though it's limited to student/faculty.\r\n\r\nWhich
    brings me to this:\r\n\r\nIn light of the spark of interest in fonts lately -
    I'm sure largely due to @font-face and the incredible number of new font users
    entering the market - are there any plans to re-evaluate the positioning of Fontlab's
    product line and make some pricing changes?\r\nWhat was once strictly a \"pro\"
    market has become a \"pro-am\" market.\r\n\r\n(I really can't see where TypeTool
    fits in today's market. And having become familiar with Fontographer through proofreading
    David Bergsland's book, I think it has a lot of potential but it's feature set
    is odd and in need of work. (Perhaps it should become a module of sorts of FLS,
    not a stand-alone product. If such a thing is feasible.)\r\nAnd BTW - I don't
    know about the Mac version, but the way the Generate font feature in FOG interfaces
    with Windows - with no provision for choice of filename other than the automatic
    default or easy output to a folder without having to drill down through directory
    trees is absolutely maddening. And time wasting in the extreme. Especially if
    your interest is in previewing fonts in browsers, as mine and many other developers
    is or has become. I had to write a command-line script for renaming just to keep
    sane.)\r\n\r\nJust thinking out loud...."

  body: "Richard, \r\n\r\nmore than two years ago, we started developing a completely
    new codebase for our products. We do realize that the current products do not
    fullfil all of the market's requirements of today. We will still do some development
    on the current products because there is a large number of current users who are
    interested in having the products improved. But we're working on new products
    at the same time \u2014 it takes time, though! \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
