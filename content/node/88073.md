  have been writing blog posts about book design targeted at writers and publishers.
  The latest installment covered dashes and ellipses. I've had some pushback from
  typographers who prefer using three spaced periods to the built-in em-width ellipsis
  glyph.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nOf course, critique on the rest of the article is welcome;
  I know there are endless subtleties to adding sidebearing space to dashes that are
  probably beyond where most indie writers and publishers will ever go, but I'm mostly
  curious about how typographers here work with ellipses.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it make sense
  that type designers would build in (at very least) an alternate single glyph with
  wider spacing if that was a popular convention?\r\n\r\nIf you do prefer the \"three
  periods\" approach, what is your rationale and your recipe for building them?\r\n\r\nSee

  body: "Personally I never insert spaces between periods to make an ellipsis because
    this can lead to the ellipsis being broken over two lines if the type reflows
    later. Your application will view each period-space as the end of a sentence and
    will feel free to insert a line break.\r\n\r\n(One way around that problem, at
    least in InDesign, is to select the periods and spaces and apply the \"no break\"
    command.)\r\n\r\nBut the method I prefer is to either use the ellipsis character
    or else use 3 periods (no spaces) and adjust the kerning, if necessary.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I prefer the ellipsis character mainly because I'm not typing on a typewriter.
    That said, online, I usually always type it as three periods...maybe because it
    *is* like typing on a typewriter...and I suppose I can see an artistic license
    argument for the spaced version . . . perhaps a longer pause. (BTW, I think you
    could space that with non-breaking spaces...at least online, though I assume InDesign
    has the same option)

  body: I know it's a personal thing, but I'd check out the available ellipsis with
    a font firsthand - usually they've been designed as fit for purpose and to complement
    the typeface. An exception I can think of is if an ellipsis needed to be created
    for some really small type. Brighust's got a page on it if I recall.

  body: "I always use the ellipsis because it is one (composite) keystroke, not three.\r\nThat
    makes it quicker to set and easier to edit, avoiding the possibility of placing
    the cursor between periods.\r\nAnd also because I am a typophile who prefers the
    \u201Cclever\u201D way of doing things!"
