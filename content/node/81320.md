body: "LyX 2.0 is currently in RC3. You can download source (but not precompiled binaries
  yet) from LyX.org.\r\n\r\nMore detail on new features [[here.|http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/NewInLyX20#xetex]]\r\n\r\nEssentially,
  by this time a month from now, you should be able to download a version of LyX which
  both allows you to create documents using any font installed on your system, and
  allows you to apply OpenType features. You\u2019re still at the mercy of TeX\u2019s
  content-centric way of thinking, so the app is best suited for long text-centric
  documents like books and articles with a finite set of styles that you customize,
  and is of course a bad choice for advertising layouts. But managing a separate set
  of TeX-enabled fonts in a bunch of text files will be a thing of the past once the
  XeTeX incorporation is finished. I am cautiously optimistic.\r\n\r\nIn other news,
  there is an upcoming Google Summer of Code project to add OpenType feature access
  inside OpenOffice.org.\r\n\r\nAs for Scribus: Scribus forum administrator Christoph_S
  wrote [[this|https://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=1413]] on Oct 24 last year:\r\n\u201CYes,
  and we had to create a separate branch that's not even publically accessible, because
  major parts of the code have to be torn apart and rewritten. The changes are so
  big that we\u2019re currently glad if the code can be built, which doesn\u2019t
  mean that it already works as expected. Expect first usable results next year, at
  the earliest, when the dust has settled.\u201D"

  body: I could not get LyX 2.0RC2 to output PDF through XeTeX if I had any system
    (i.e. non-TeX) font installed. They just put out RC3 tonight, and I'm trying again
    with this new install. In the meantime I've made some progress learning my way
    around LyX. Once the XeTeX part of it works reliably in Windows, it will be the
    first serious open source Opentype-savvy Windows publishing application available.

    project I'd like to undertake for myself. This sounds promising indeed!
