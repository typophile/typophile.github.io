body: "Okay...I found this forum through googling for an answer to a random font question,
  and I'm hoping you font experts will be able to help me.  It's kind of a random
  question.\r\n\r\nI'm the IT Mgr in my office, which is an office of Windows users.
  \ We have 1 Mac user who works remotely.  He is running Win XP on his Mac, in order
  to run the software our company uses - namely, Lotus Freelance Graphics.  We do
  a lot of presentations with graphs of data, and we've found Freelance to be superior
  in that department. So even though the program was discontinued in 1999 or 2000,
  we still use it and have no trouble with it on XP Pro and Win2K machines. \r\n\r\nRecently,
  this Mac user brought to my attention that he had to change the fonts on every page
  of a presentation because the Freelance font engine is outdated, and when he opened
  the file on his Mac (running Windows), things got screwy.  However, our presentation
  template uses Arial. Not Arial MT, or Arial Black, plain Arial. Which I would think
  would have no problem across platforms.  And furthermore, we open presentations
  on tons of PCs -- home computers, laptops, work computers, etc...and never had to
  change fonts on any windows-based machine.\r\n\r\nMy question is: is it the font
  engine as my user stated, or is it a windows-on-mac issue?\r\n\r\nI don't know anything
  about running Windows on a Mac, and how that affects fonts. And since Freelance
  is so outdated, it's hard to find info online about that specific program.  \r\n\r\nI
  don't know anything about font engines either...so any help you can provide will
  be much appreciated! My boss is anxiously awaiting my response. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

  body: There are two ways to use Windows on a Mac -one is to use bootcamp and set
    up a dual boot system. This would be the safest option. The other is to run Parallels
    or similar virtualization software that lets you run Windows in a window on the
    Mac - I'd guess this is more risky. My gut instinct is that the problem relates
    to the fonts installed and how Lotus enumerates them, my guess is that it's tripping
    over font conflicts related to the Mac fonts. That might be as simple as the user
    copying the Mac fonts over and installing them on the Windows side.

  body: Interesting. That makes sense. I believe he's running bootcamp but I am verifying
    that. Hopefully it will be something that simple. I also found some complaints
    about display issues in the bootcamp/windows environment that are fixed with video
    driver upgrades. I can have him try that as well. Will keep you posted. Thank
    you!

  body: I don't think Windows (or any other OS) running in Parallels has any access
    to the host OS or resources like fonts. It's not like Classic running on OS X.
    Parallels virtualizes the PC hardware, not the software running on it. You can
    access files from the host system, but the host system appears to the virtual
    machine as just another computer on the network.

  body: 'One more thing: When running Windows with Boot Camp, Windows boots from a
    separate partition and the Mac start up volume is not visible or mountable. Windows
    running on a Mac with Boot Camp functions exactly like Windows running on any
    PC hardware, except that you have the option to boot into Mac OS at start up.'

  body: Thanks Mark, that kind of reinforces my feeling that the user may have copied
    Mac fonts to the Windows partition (jumping through hoops to do so) and there's
    a clash.

  body: I run Windows XP Professional on my MacBook Pro, using Parallels Desktop (build
    3214, 06/21/2007). There is no way I can access the fonts on the Mac OS side.
    Conversely, the TT and OT fonts I use on my Windows side are usable on the Mac
    side.

  body: "With Bootcamp, when you boot up in Windows, you cannot access any of the
    files from the Mac partition of your hard drive. But if you boot into Windows,
    you can access ALL of the files from your Windows partition.\r\n\r\nSo, in Mac
    mode, you can move files to and from your \"PC,\" but not vice versa. This means
    that if you want Mac fonts in Windows, you have to copy them to the Windows font
    folder from Mac OS X. However, I don't think that any of the Mac system fonts
    will work in Windows. Windows doesn't support AAT fonts, right? Are all Mac system
    fonts AAT format, or just some of them?\r\n\r\nAnyway, even if they do work, it
    is a big workaround to view the same fonts you use on your Mac side in your Windows
    side. But if you want to copy any of the PC fonts over to your Mac side, that
    is easy.\r\n\r\nSi, as an aside, does using the Windows fonts in Mac OS X violate
    the Microsoft EULA? One might assume that it would not, since both Windows and
    Mac OS X in this case would be installed on the same workstation."

    it's running in. The only thing it can recognize are 'shared' folders that Parallels
    creates. It 'tricks' Windows into seeing a folder on your OSX install as a shared
    drive within windows.\r\n\r\nSo, yea, if you want to use fonts in windows, you
    need to install them *in* windows.\r\n"
