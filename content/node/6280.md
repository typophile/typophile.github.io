body: Here is the project I&#39;m working hard on at the moment. Its for a company
  called AquaTreat, they are a water treatment/purification/effluent treatment company.
  Their current &#39;logo&#39; currently consists of typing AQUAtreat just like that,
  they cant see whats wrong with that but as I always use the logo as the basis for
  the site I would like to present them with some alternatives. Any critism is more
  welcome than you will ever know! <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47169.gif"

  body: Photo, nice colors, the first two I don&#39;t get the water drop out of the
    Q, number 3 is fine, straight forward simplem number 4 doesn&#39;t read at all.
    Maybe the water drop could start out a muddy color and transform into a pure blue
    just a thought

  body: The drop reminds me on the counter &#40;or is it the bowl?&#41; of a lowercase
    &#34;a&#34; maybe you can keep the logo purely typographic and play around with
    this space. Also, I think I would use a different font for this job. That&#39;s
    just me. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: I agree about the font. Looks like a feminine product. Why don&#39;t you try
    and express purification or purity in your logo. Look at good water bottle packaging.
    I like &#34;Smart Water&#34; they have a pure feeling in their logotype and packaging.
    Also think about the utility aspect. A good water company should have a very trustable
    versitile logo. As it stands now your logo can be trusted on the surface but lacks
    backbone and longevity.

  body: Yes! Man, I had forgotten about your logo Scott, but before I scrolled down
    to your post I was thinking that a really subtle &#40;elegant&#41; droplet off
    of the Q&#39;s tail would be much stronger than trying to force the counter to
    form any shapes. Or maybe just a droplet falling from one of the other letters
    acting as an assymetrical balance somehow.

    for Autumn -- my favorite time of year. <BR> <BR>Photo -- Scott&#39;s &#34;icon&#34;
    might suggest a better way to incorporate the droplet into your letters. Perhaps
    the typeface needs to be more substantial?

  body: photo, when I see your logo I cant help but think the water drop looks like
    half of the ying-yang symbol.was this on purpose? if not I would reshape the drop,
    it might have religious conotations. Does anyone else see it? <BR> <BR>IM

  body: My friend Mike once saw this line on a poster for bottled water and almost
    drove off the highway. &#34;Twice the Hydrogen as Oxygen&#34; I&#39;m waiting
    for low carb water myself.  <BR> <BR>As for this project Tiffany is right If its
    a treatment facility it needs a heftier more industrial look. Imply &#34;we can
    handle your volumne water purifacation&#34;. Right now it is more like a bottled
    water logo.

  body: Thanks for all your comments, and thanks for being nice and not ripping it
    apart! <BR>I agree with nearly all of what has been said, I to feel it needs &#39;bulking
    up&#39; and that it does look too much like a mineral water logo at the moment!  <BR>No
    one mentioned that in the first two it looks a bit like an upside down apple!
    I thought that was gonna be one of the first comments. <BR>Scott - thanks for
    showing me your designs, I really like the icon one, might go someway down that
    road and see what happens <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
