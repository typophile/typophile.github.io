body: "I've seen many different ways time is handled. For example 6p.m. 6 p.m. (with
  a space and periods, which I read is the way it's supposed to be written) Sometimes
  PM(can be in small caps) If it was 5\u20146 p.m. there would be a en dash between
  the range of time. Is there a correct way in typography on how to set the time?
  How would I write 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.? 10 a.m.\u20147 p.m.? \r\n\r\nWould I write
  it with a space between the abbreviations and the time but not between the period
  and the 7? So that it ends up as 10(space) a.m.(en dash)7(space)p.m.? I was wondering
  this as I was designing a range of time that started from morning to the evening.
  Maybe I have read it somewhere but have forgotten. I have heard that it should be
  an en dash with spaces on both left and right sides as opposed to without any spaces
  between words/characters like I've read elsewhere. I just want to know if there
  is a correct way in how to approach time or time range in typography. Thanks in
  advance!"

    is usually a matter of editorial rather than typographic style. In any confrontation
    between editors and designers/typesetters, the editors most always win. I once
    did battle with an editor over using \"ebook\" rather than \"e-book,\" on the
    grounds that ebooks are now a common part of the language and landscape, just
    like \"email.\"  We sort of compromised -- I found a way to refer to them without
    using that term at all. Otherwise, the editor's opinion would prevail.\r\n\r\nThe
    <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> will specify one way, likely the Associated
    Press will have a different one (just as with the \"correct\" way to set an ellipsis).\r\n\r\nIIRC,
    Chicago recommends small caps -- one reason why AP would be different. "

    many more. You might start with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers\r\nIf
    you have questions about something that is not resolved by a guide, I trust that
    someone in this forum will opine for you.\r\nBTW don't forget that there are major

    you should go by the writer's style guide. If a style guide isn't being used,
    pick one.\r\n\r\n> how it should be written when it is something \r\n> that is
    6 a.m. to 10 p.m.\r\n\r\nFollow the guide's style, and use both a.m and p.m. for
    clarity.  \r\n\r\nAnd I'll add that although you should follow the guide, the
    main thing is that you are consistent in your style and the times are absolutely
    clear. For example, transportation schedules avoid using 12:00 because some folks
    might not be sure if 12 a.m. is noon or midnight. If you must use 12:00, add \"noon\"
    or \"midnight\" unless its already clear from the context.\r\n"

  body: "The first thing to be aware of is that A.M. stands for <em>ante meridiem</em>,
    and P.M. stands for <em>post meridiem</em>.\r\n\r\nOnce you know that, you know
    that they <em>are</em> abbreviations, and thus that periods are \"correct\", at
    least if you are aiming at the most formal and traditional English usage.\r\n\r\nAs
    well, abbreviations are usually capitalized. Here, we're dealing with abbreviations
    from the Latin, used in the measurement of time. Thus, we have the abbreviation
    for <em>Anno Domini</em> to guide us as an example, and it is definitely most
    often capitalized (if, these days, more often replaced by C.E. for \"Common Era\"
    than in the past)."

  body: I agree that using caps is the formal and traditional style (I usually use
    small caps). But the New York Times Style Guide and several other guides now say
    to use lower case. So consult the guide you're using.

    it's in a table with other time ranges, I guess.

  body: Sorry, I don't have a guide to use so I figured I would ask here. I've seen
    many different interpretations but non that were specific to the examples I was
    trying to typeset. So there isn't a specific way the time range should be typeset?
    I could write it as 6(space)a.m.(space)(en-dash)(space)10(space)p.m.?

    general? I see usually 6(en dash)10(space)p.m. and that is usually only because
    6 and 10 share the same abbreviation. But I was just wondering how would you write
    out 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. when the abbreviations are different. Do you add a space
    on both sides of such as \"6(space)a.m.(space)(en dash)(space)10(space)p.m.)\"
    or without a space between both sides of the en dash. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm really
    trying to see is how do you approach this in posters/advertisements and other
    design where there is writing but not to such a large extent as books or paragraphs
    where it could be a short statement of a range of time. Would I approach this
    in the same way? Of course, I would think the best way is to keep things consistent
    which means if I'm typesetting it one way in an article or story the advertisements
    should follow a similar style. Or maybe the advertisements should deal with the
    time ranges differently. "

    probably do it (unless the writer tells me otherwise). If the space around the
    dash looks too big, tighten it a little. I think you're worrying a bit too much
    about this, just make it look good and be consistent."
