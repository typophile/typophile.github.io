body: "I'd love some help from you guys.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a letterpressed wedding
  invitation. The event itself is casual with a pig roast immediately afterward, so
  I'm thinking that the tone of the invite should be relaxed and entertaining, too.\r\n\r\nI'm
  creating an oversized (8Wx12H) \"poster\" for the invite that I want to be typography
  only. I'm thinking that I'd like to use classic typefaces that will vary from large
  to small, much like old letterpress posters/announcements or type specimen from
  old metal and wood type.\r\n\r\nIt will be letterpressed on cotton paper, some thick
  stuff that has some tooth.\r\n\r\nIt'll probably be black type (maybe a spot color,
  too) on white paper.\r\n\r\nThe style will be anti-formal wedding letterpress, and
  more in the throw-me-together-a-quick-poster-on-your-letterpress-in-1945 zone.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to get some suggestions on typefaces to use for this style.\r\n\r\nThink BIG
  small BIG small BIG NUMBERS small, mostly centered.\r\n\r\nI'd like to include an
  old gothic or grotesque of some sort- Franklin seems too mean looking. Trade and
  News don't have quite enough character.\r\n\r\nI'd like to find three typefaces
  that really feel nice together- and one that has a nice set of numbers for the date/time,
  etc. \r\n\r\nI have included some samples of a couple of cheap letterpress posters
  from 50+ years ago- both use Cheltenham, but are a bit different with the headline
  faces.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or pointers toward other examples of this type of
  style is greatly appreciated...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img002_5660.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/img003_3606.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/img009_6221.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/img010_6411.jpg]"

  body: I'd suggest finding a local printer with a nice selection of wood faces and
    ask if you could do the typesetting on-site. Work with what they got. Would add
    to the 'ad-hoc' feel.
