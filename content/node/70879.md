    when you save the JPEG you have to set it on maximum quality. If you have this
    image with the artifacts and then try to save it as a PNG, it will still save
    the artifacts."

  body: No there aren't. Since our screens are only capable of displaying tiny colored
    squares (pixels) with relatively poor resolutions (72 ppi) there will be some
    aliasing. Depending on anti aliasing techniques it could be more or less distracting.
    But there is no way to display bezier curves without aliasing of some kind.

  body: "There are several formats commonly used for web graphics -- JPEG (normally
    used for photos), GIF (normally used for images just containing a few solid colors,
    like some logos), and PNG (a newer format with some advantages but not supported
    by older browsers).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest saving your logo as both a JPEG and a GIF
    -- using the highest quality settings -- and see which one looks best.\r\n\r\nStart
    with the highest-quality original image when making your web image; don't make
    a copy of a copy of a copy.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Photoshop, use the \"Save for
    Web\" command. Once again, use the highest quality settings. This will create
    a larger file but it will also be better quality."

  body: "I don't see the artifacts when the image is uploaded to tinypic either.\r\n\r\nIt
    has to do with the way that the site compresses the image. If you look at the
    size of the image you posted its 8kb, while the one you uploaded is only 4kb.
    The site may be trying to compensate for the small file size and that's creating
    artifacts.\r\n\r\nIf you posted a .png the site re-rendered it as a .jpeg. I would
    suggest making a 400x400 px version and save as a web format. Choose jpeg and
    put the settings at maximum. Post it again here and use the preview to see how
    it looks. If its still bad check the image information and see how the site is
    handling it."
