body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble with a custom font I created in FLS5:
  It's appearing at the bottom of Word's font menu, below the last alphabetical listing.
  The font contains special glyphs placed in FL's Supplementary Private Use Area-A,
  which I suspect is why the font appears down there (with all the CJK fonts). Does
  anyone know how I can get the font to appear in it's correct alphabetical position,
  without removing glyphs?\r\n\r\nAlso, a related problem is that the font does not
  appear under Word's Insert > Symbol menu. I have Googled, searched the Forums both
  here and on FontLab without any luck. Any help from anyone is appreciated!"

    encoding.

    get the extended glyph set (set in Flab's Private Use Area) to show up in Word's
    Insert Symbol dialog box? In Adobe apps it's easy, you just use the glyphs palette,
    but Word it seems to be harder.\r\n\r\nAgain, apologies if this was previously
    covered elsewhere in Typophile\r\n\r\nCheers, Wayne Thompson, ATF"

  body: "ATF\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just an assumption: Check the box \"Encoding and Unicode,
    Unicode Ranges, <strong>Private Use</strong>\". (I think you can trust in the
    auto settings of this FontLab dialog. You know, normally you cannot blindly trust
    in the auto functions of FontLab.) But there is a problem, if you have an italic
    style (linked to regular) with more glyphs in the PUA than the regular style,
    at least in OpenOffice. Then you cannot access the part of the PUA of the italic
    style, that is missing in the regular style. So you probably should provide dummy
    characters in the regular style. Furthermore I assume, that the Unicode points
    of the PUA characters should be the same in both styles, at least I doubt, that
    Word can find the italic partner of the dummy character, if its Unicode point
    is different.\r\n\r\nIn this context a general tip: Don\u2019t style link to bold,
    at least not in those cases, in which your font family contains more than two
    weights!"
