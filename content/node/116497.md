  for New England history and literature--especially the Transcendentalists--with
  my love of the book arts.\r\nIt's \"Spirit & Matter,\" selections from Emerson's
  <em>Nature</em> and Thoreau's <em>Ktaadn</em> with commentary by [[http://hep.ucsb.edu/people/witherel/bw.html|Elizabeth
  Hall Witherell]], printed in an edition of 100 by Carolee Campbell at [[http://ninjapressbooks.com|Ninja
  Press]] as a <em>festschrift</em> for the bicentennial of Emerson's birth in 2003.
  The paper is English Charter Oak, printed from handset Garamont and Erbar types,
  and sewn into a cover of handmade raw-flax paper.\r\nI'm one happy typophile.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/emersonthoreau_image3_3986.jpg]"
