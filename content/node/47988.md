    but visually its kind of interesting,\r\n\r\nThis Hebrew type design at the base
    of the artist's illustration was popular and widespread in Israel. This was because
    the design was available for relatively little expense as a stick or rub-down
    letter from Letraset of Israel.\r\n\r\nThe original design was popularized in
    Europe and Russia about 200, based upon the popular Hebrew type design, called,
    \"Vilna\", in a very heavy weight for display use.\r\n\r\nThe origins of the design
    are even older. In his thin but fascinating book on type design, Frederik Goudy
    reports that an elderly man visited the Bodoni School of Type in Italy from Russia.
    He commissioned the students of Bodoni to create for his printing press sets of
    Hebrew letters based upon on old Hebrew manuscripts of drawings of ancient Hebrew
    letter forms.\r\n\r\nThe elderly man was Mr. Romm senior, whose wife and sons
    published the popular standard edition of the Talmud in Vilna, Lithuania. The
    original Talmud was burned by the tens of thousands by the Nazis, and the Romm
    family printing house and the original printing plates were destroyed by the Communists.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a striking and uncanny resemblance between the famous Bodoni design and the
    characteristics of the popular Vilna typeface. You could think one design influenced
    the other.\r\n\r\nIf we dig back even further, to before the advent of the printing
    press, Hebrew books were often featured elaborate and attractive illumination
    and beautiful hand-drawn lettering, similar and perhaps even greater than what
    we have in modern books. (If fact, Maimonides instructs there are various graphical
    rules regarding the shape and positioning of Hebrew letters, indicating this is
    an ancient art.)\r\n\r\nI discover that this popular Vilna typeface design was
    used in pre-printing press time periods.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I must conclude logically
    that the well-known Bodoni design did not influence the popular Vilna design.
    If anything, the Vilna design influenced and is the basis of the Bodoni design.\r\n"
