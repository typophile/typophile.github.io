body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am designing a cover letter for our catalogue that we are about
  to mail out. The cover letter is basically the address of the customer we are shipping
  to, plus some sales information about what is in the new catalogue. I want to lay
  it out with 4-6 boxes which have a headline like \"New lower prices!\" or \"Great
  new freight rates\" and a few words below those headlines that say \"see page xx
  for details\" or \"Range XYZ page 55, range ABC, page 66\" etc.\r\n\r\nI'm searching
  for fonts that I can use for the headline statements and the information below it.
  Something that says new and exciting and has a modern feel to it.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue
  is for a wholesaler of organic and eco products.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJason"

  body: "I was going to say [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html|Museo]] (by
    Jos Buivenga), but then I read the line where you specify the industry and thought
    better of it. I would recommend you look a Buivenga's other typefaces, like the
    [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html|Fontin]] [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontinsans.html|family]].
    That family provides enough variety to set the entire page.\r\n\r\nFor a cleaner,
    friendly and pretty economical sans, check out [[http://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF095002X1P2&start=1|District]]

    (also by Buivenga). Also take a look at Yanone's [[http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/|Kaffeesatz]]."
