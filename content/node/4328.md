  body: 'I can&#39;t find a good match, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a real stencil
    font, because an O would need some support, if it were a true stencil. What I
    did was try to find a slab serif that was somewhat square and then simulate this
    logo &#40;with an upside-down M for a W, and some clumsy outline manipulations
    in Illustrator&#41;. Here&#39;s  the result of using Red Rooster&#39;s Equestrienne
