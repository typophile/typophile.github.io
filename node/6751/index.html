The areas in white will be clear. <BR> <BR>I'd appreciate any comments on the card design, and tips/warnings from anyone who has printed on clear or semi-transparent media before. <BR> <BR>Many thanks for any assistance rendered! <BR> <BR>-Mike <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49294.jpg" alt=""></div>

Suggestions: <BR> <BR>1 Decrease the size of &quot;Communications Consultant&quot; unless the title is more important than the actual contact information. <BR> <BR>2 Either lose the gray band or find a way to create more space between the enclosed type and the edges of the gray band</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, <BR> <BR>I like the design in general. <BR> <BR>I agree with Scott's (as always) well made points. I also would like to suggest a couple of things: <BR> <BR>1. The cross-alignment of your name, title, and email on the left with the other contact info on the right needs a little attention. You might try aligning the top of your phone number with the top of your name and the bottom line (your web address) with the bottom of your email and then split the remainder with the lines in between. Losing the quote is good advice and would help you give breathing space. <BR> <BR>2. If contact info is on the right then shouldn't email be grouped there too? Did you try that? <BR> <BR>3. The parentheses around the area code of your phone number make the line appear indented, you might want to nudge it to the left. Trust your eyes after your grid is defined. <BR> <BR>4. Any reason for the dotless 'i's? I only ask because I noticed it not because I have any crit of it. <BR> <BR>5. You might try reducing the size of your logo and separate it with more white space. This will set it off more and reducing the size of your title will help too. Further to this (and further to my point 2.) I would reduce the size of all the contact info and put the email on the right. If you want to make it primary put it first. You could try bolding it too. You'd have to see. <BR> <BR>Roughly then the card becaomes four quadrants (though not necessarily strictly delineated): <BR>Upper left: logo <BR>Upper right: whitespace <BR>Lower-left: name and title <BR>lower right: contact and location <BR> <BR>I'd better stop now. I haven't been around for a bit and I'm going to overfunction. Hang in there! Keep us posted. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello again, <BR> <BR>Scott and Jon: thank you very much for your critiques. I really appreciate the assistance you both provided! <BR> <BR>I've drafted up a new proof of the business card. The top graphic shows how the grid is laid out, and the second graphic is the card without the guides. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49550.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I've tweaked font spacing, layout, and sizes. I think I'm much happier with how the card looks now. <BR> <BR>Jon, regarding the email address: when I put it in the column with the other contact info, the card became so off-balanced that it didn't look right. As well, my email address is how I do the majority of communications, so I like how it's &quot;front-and-centre&quot; compared to the other address elements. As per your suggestion I also scaled down the logo size, and I prefer how this looks. <BR> <BR>Scott, I left the grey bar in (but I increased the total size of it) since it really looks empty and unfocused without it. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your tips on the printing type. I am going to use Pantone Metallic 8183 C on the logo, and will be printing it on one of these stocks: (still waiting to hear back from my printer) <BR> <BR>CTI Paper USA - Glama Natural Clear 48 lb. <BR>Reich Paper - Clear #48 <BR>Gilbert - Gilclear Fineline Heavy (this one has very faint lines watermarked into the paper. I'm still debating if I'll use it, or if I'll go with the plain translucents above) <BR> <BR>I am really excited about how this is shaping up, though more comments on this new draft are greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>-Mike</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, <BR> <BR>Looking good.  I might think about loosing the paranthesis on the area code.  That way your alignment will look stronger. <BR> <BR>One printing idea.  The cool thing about transparant printing is how you can print things on the back and they show through.  So perhaps you can print that gray bar on the back of your card. <BR> <BR>Might be nice.</div>

I think the balance is a lot better, and I like the logo's size and alignment way better now too.  <BR> <BR>I think Peter has a really neat idea with the printing the grey bar on the back idea. That would be very cool. What about bleeding it off the bottom? <BR> <BR><i>(this one has very faint lines watermarked into the paper. I'm still debating if I'll use it, or if I'll go with the plain translucents above)</i> <BR> <BR>Are these lines symetrical, sequential or anything?

		<div class="commentbody">Hello again, everyone! <BR> <BR>I briefly considered swapping the parenthesis with square brackets, but taking the punctuation marks out altogether might work too. Here's how it would look: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49657.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I think I personally prefer the version without the brackets, but please let me know what you think. <BR> <BR>I like your idea about printing the bar on the back of the card. The paper is quite translucent, but a really dark bar on the back might look good. I'm going to raise this with my printer and get their opinion on this. <BR> <BR>As for the paper with the lines, I decided to dump it late last night. Even though these lines were evenly spaced and looked nice on their own, I have a feeling they would only conflict with the simplicity of the card and add unnecessary clutter. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your comments on these drafts! <BR> <BR>-Mike</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looks like offset on GillClear or Glamma - not a real difficult print job - ask your printer to use hard dry ink and it will dry much faster. Cindy - did you mean Yupo? I have done menus on Yupo that didn't have any problem - although like with Gill Clear or Glamma you should request hard dry (sometimes called fast dry) inks. Also make sure they are using an oil based ink with enough drying agent. I asked a press op what he does to keep synthetic stock from smearing and he said not to run it too heavy, and to use the right ink - not just what your printer has on the shelf.</div>
