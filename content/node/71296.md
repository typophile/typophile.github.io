body: "I just completed a three month over haul of my entire web site. The learning
  curve was pretty strong, but I mucked my way through it. The biggest improvement
  is that I have e-commerce on the site now. \r\n\r\nPreviously, I didn't have a way
  to offer automatic downloads at my site. Customers would pay for a font with PayPal
  and then I would get an email letting me know the order was placed and that I needed
  to send the customer their font(s). Now, it's all automatic, so I don't need to
  be at my computer 24/7.\r\n\r\nIf you get a chance, stop by. I'd be interested in
  comments or suggestions for further improvements.\r\n\r\nRob Leuschke\r\nhttp://www.typesetit.com"

  body: "The front page is a disaster in Firefox and Safari\u2014you\u2019re breaking
    the HTML box model all over the place. There are misalignment and overlap problems
    all over the place in the menus. If you have a hard time with web design I recommend
    going with a CMS system like <a href=\"http://www.indexhibit.org/\">Indexhibit</a>
    or Wordpress and just using a canned theme. You can setup a Wordpress site using
    a good commercial theme and throw in a store plugin without ever having to deal
    with any of the code yourself."

  body: Yeah, that's a pretty crazy site with ample use of dropshadow. Agree with
    suggestion about Indexhibit or Wordpress.

  body: I've made corrections to the code. Thanks for the screenshot. I use Safari
    and those issues weren't appearing.

  body: "Thanks Frode,\r\n\r\nAs it has probably become apparently, I know enough
    to be dangerous. Some of the things I have found are just plain strange. For example,
    I used Adobe Fireworks to create some menus. But when I checked the browser compatibility
    (which I should have done before I released the site), Fireworks had created code
    that simply was incompatible with most browsers. Other issues deal with the use
    of <span> and <font> attributes.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, thanks for the offer. I just
    need to work thru it, and learn in the process.... then I will be even more dangerous.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and Hozea Ngoh... thanks for the screen shot. It helped. My wife did a screen
    shot of a couple of pages as well from a computer she has at work, and now I realize
    how bad my web creation really is. \r\n\r\nI'll get it working eventually. So
    thanks to every one who was kind with their comments. Time to get a clook into
    \ Indexhibit or Wordpress.\r\n\r\nRL"

    is the only way to go. A functional drop down menu doesn\u2019t take a lot of
    work, though. "

  body: "I dunno if you're still using a 800x600 resolution, but the site looks way
    to small. Even on my 1156x864 resolution. Windows' ClearType rendering causes
    the small text to be almost unreadable.\r\nHowever your new features might be
    useful, I think the site has an old-fashioned feel and the colors doesn't match
    really. White background for the drop down menus doesn't work well either.\r\n\r\nI'd
    also recommend WordPress with a nice template."
