  date for the sixth Brand Perfect Tour Think Tank and Design Master Classes, which
  brings together brands, agencies and developers in a unique forum to improve brand
  performance and the user experience in the digital landscape. \r\n\r\nPrior to the
  main event, on May 7, Brand Perfect speakers as well as high profile brands will
  meet to discuss implications on brands revealed from research carried out by London-based
  Contagious Communications. Attendees are then invited to stay for an exclusive screening
  of Doug Wilson\u2019s \u201CLinotype: The Film.\u201D \r\n\r\nBoth events will take
  place at the inspiring [[http://creativity.org/|Children\u2019s Creativity Museum]],
  in the heart of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, The Brand Perfect Tour will travel
  to key cities in Europe and America, gathering the branding community to examine
  the challenges of delivering brands in the complex multi-channel environment. The
  series of events entitled \u201CIn Search of\u2026 Seamless Brand Experiences,\u201D
  will address the mobile, retail and publishing sectors, delving deep into the issues
  that these industries face when creating and developing their brands.\r\n\r\nThe
  first event in San Francisco, \u201CAdventures in Mobile,\u201D sets the stage for
  communication and discovery that tackles mobile branding to deliver authentic, continuous
  experiences that delight consumers. Speakers, to be announced, will include technology
  and brand experts, who will share their successes along with their failures. Attendees
  will also gain hands-on insights into best practices, as they participate and contribute
  in the Brand Perfect Design Master Classes.\r\n\r\nPreviously, The Brand Perfect
  Tour visited Berlin, London, Hamburg and New York, where capacity audiences heard
  from branding experts such as Wolff Olins, Landor, and SomeOne; brands such as NET-A-PORTER,
  O2 and The Financial Times; and service developers such as Fjord and Future Platforms.
  All provided real-life examples, while sharing what was learned when facing difficult
  branding challenges in today\u2019s evolving mobile landscape.\r\n\r\nThis year
  Contagious, a leading global authority on the intersection of marketing communications,
  consumer culture and emerging technologies, will be partnering with Brand Perfect
  to provide key depth and insights into branding trends for digital media.\r\n\r\n\u201CContagious
  has been called an early warning system for the advertising industry, so we\u2019re
  delighted to be involved with Brand Perfect, which promotes education around branding
  innovation in the digital age,\u201D said Ed White, senior writer at Contagious.\r\n\r\nTo
