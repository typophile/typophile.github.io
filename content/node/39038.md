  any ideas about super elligible fonts for use with very small sizes for a map with
  street names.\r\nSome thoughts though:\r\n\u2013 TazzerText? from Lucas\r\n\u2013
  Cordid Condensed? from Lucas too\r\n\u2013 Fago from FontFont?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\nNicolas"

  body: For anything where I need a small but legible pixel font I've always used
    Joe Gillespie's [[http://minifonts.com/|MiniFonts]]. These are great little fonts
    and (if you're a poor bloke like me) they won't break your bank account.

    handle its self on maps too.

  body: Is Bell Centennial proprietary? If it is, there is good ol' Bell Gothic. I've
    used it on maps, and one good thing is that it wraps around curves nicely. That
    is handy because unless you are doing a street map of Manhattan, roads do tend
    to curve.
