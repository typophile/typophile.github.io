    a bit less \"rounded\" no?"

  body: The subsequent samples you posted are of a different typeface than the first
    two (which, as Jan pointed out, are set in Calibri).

  body: "Oh I see. Thank you both!! \r\n\r\nSorry to piggyback a second one. The CME
    Group site is using different sans faces in different size ranges. I'll call it
    \"scale pairing\". I assumed they were using a single font. And when I looked
    up Calibri... it didn't match the bigger example, so I assumed it must be wrong.\r\n\r\nMy
    mistake!!"

  body: "No doubt. I thought it was Benton Sans, but when I kept seeing the spur-less
    \"G\" glyphs of Calibri (and possibly other faces on the site), I sorta blinded
    myself.\r\n\r\nBut Calibri... that one was definitely under my radar. I guess
    it works well at small sizes on the screen. That could be useful!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!"
