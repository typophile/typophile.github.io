body: "I've run across a few threads on here where people have recommended some excellent
  choices for serif and sans 'workhorse' test/headline faces. Stuff with some flavor,
  but eminently usable and not likely to date soon.\r\n\r\nBeing a one person studio,
  I tend to be a bit more budget minded than some of the beautiful faces I've seen
  would fit with. Can anyone make recommendations for type families, and foundries
  where one could find real killer values like Stefan Hattenbach's beautiful Tarocco
  Opentype (7 faces) for a mere US$109. http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_tarocco.html\r\n\r\nAny
  other jewels worth checking out?"

    use pretty often.\r\n\r\nI think [[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/|Apex]]
    is a great buy. I have gotten a lot of use from it.\r\n\r\nI also use [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php|Dolly]]
    regularly. I have used it for a client's website and have used it in my photography
    portfolio.\r\n \r\nI'm working on a website now using [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=bulldog&x=0&y=0|Bulldog]].
    I love this font and it is reasonable. I know it is going to be very useful in
    other projects.\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n "

    could be considered a workhorse, but I priced the basic TrueType family (no SC&osf)
    in the budget category, $59 for 7 fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The ITC Stone superfamily is $179 (56 fonts in four styles) at stonetypefoundry.com;
    his Magma family is $99 (24 fonts). <a href="http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html">Fontin
    and Fontin serif are excellent and free</a>. And of course you can always buy
    a used Corel Draw on eBay and get dozens of workhorse families cheap; at least
    half a dozen of them will always be in style!
