  huge and fast and is a solid piece of plastic,\r\n\r\nbut are they any real advantages
  to the average graphic designer besides its size?\r\n\r\nI just want to know why
  anyone would buy it for $3000 rather than a nice one for $200."

    Epson.com for less than $100, and the scans it outputs are almost indistinguishable
    from the high-end Epson and Microtek scanners that I\u2019ve used. The average
    designer is printing work at no more than 300 lpi, so what\u2019s the advantage
    of a high-end scanner? A scanner like that might matter if you\u2019re archiving
    important photos or doing high-quality enlarging. If something really incredible
    needs scanning you can always just have the printer do it on a drum scanner that
    will blows away a flatbed and just charge it to the client. And 11\"x17\" scanning
    is nice to have if you do a lot of drawing, but that can be had for $1500."

    thing about the higher-priced scanners is you can scan in the 16-bit mode. There
    is a lot of detail, esp. shadow detail, that can be recovered from most photographs,
    but this requires some heavy manipulation of the image -- severe compression,
    then re-expansion, similar to HDR compression techniques. Working in the 16-bit
    mode pretty much eliminates posterization as an issue. Sample down to 8-bit as
    a last step."

    I would imagine that all of those scans pale in comparison with a scan done on
    a professional drum scanner from Scitex or Hell. But then most of the great color
    separation houses have been put out of business by the \"crappy scan, do-it-yourself,
    I'm not paying money for that\" crowd.\r\n\r\nThe race to the bottom continues.\r\n\r\nJames"

    last year (after mine regrettably stopped working), I am positively in withdrawl.
    \ There is nothing compared to the depth of shading and color that you get with
    a higher end scanner.  Especially since I scan subtle sketches, marker and watercolor
    renderings, there is such a difference.  \r\n"

    afford it, I'd get it. It's no doubt your scans will come out beautiful, especially
    in comparison to the $200 scanners most common people own. BUT...most of us can't
    afford it...so to us, they are just pretty to look at, hoping one day we work
    for someone that will let us play with it.\r\n\r\n\r\ncourtney"
