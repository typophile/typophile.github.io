body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nAs much as I love this store, I can figure out the rustic
  serif they use for much of their advertizing. It looks like MVB Celestia Antiqua
  but its not (you can go to http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/celestia/pk_celestia_one.htm
  to make comparisons)\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks a ton.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\nPS...
  cost plus uses belwe and engravers. But they dear sarah some of their materials
  as well :-)"
