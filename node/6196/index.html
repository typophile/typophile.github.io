<div class=commentbody>Ok. <br> <br>The Revival that i am talking about, is based on Garamond, but i think that we need new fonts that works on screen as good as in print, so with the respect of the typographic tradition, i try to do my best. Please visit the critique/bitmap text area, the typography is called "Garadot". <br> <br>The true spirit of the original metal type was exist only on the pass by the punchcutters, and i am only trying to discovers the limits on bitmap fonts designs ;) ...so the cleaning reading of every type means a little of Universality. <br> <br>Thanks for the comments <br> <br>MH</div>

<div class=commentbody>> do you Think that Garamond is French because you know it was Produced in France? <br> <br>Good question. And of course I can't really know the answer: a system can never understand itself. <br> <br>I think there are two levels of knowledge, conscious and subconscious, with the latter being more shallow and inconstant, but more forceful. The fact that I consciously know that Garamond is of French origin ruins any possible subconscious appreciation. Fortunately for laymen (readers) they don't know the background, so the type can have a deeper association with social/national/ethnic context. Do laymen associate Garamond with French culture? My point is that they do, if only to a limited extent. What about Peignot? Very much. <br> <br>> Even the most neutral typefaces have something to say. <br> <br>What does FF Kievit have to say? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>In regards to the "do laymen associate Garamond with France?" <br> <br>While I am aware of Garamond originating in France, in comparison to you all, I'm probably more a layman than not. However, Garamond does not scream vive France to me... <br> <br>This topic is fascinating... I am aware of typefaces countries of origin and I have made some possibly stereotypical connections -- those Scandanavians and their clean, lovely sans serifs!!! And maybe, just maybe, I thought Europeans were a bit more fond of sans serifs than Americans. <br> <br>But most of all, I thought there was a pantheon of great typefaces that stood up over time and popular the world over, Garamond among them along with Goudy, Helvetica, Times... maybe type is better at conveying a time as opposed to a place...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Keith, distinctly Canadian type design isn't so nonexistant as you might believe. There are some great, unique typefaces like Cartier and Richler that are being used by Canadian publishers for a unique look. There's also Les Usherwood, who's done a great deal of great faces like Usherwood, Seagull, and Lesmore. <br> <br>Paul</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have a French Secam VHS video from French TV where they ask people on the streets what they associate with some particularly fonts composed always with same word George: fonts are Arepo, Champion (one from Boltana, a Copperplate), Kosmik, Skia, Le Monde masterhead font (the only black letter I have at hand). <br> <br>The answer has been (various but the main idea is there by the majority): Grec yogurt, Men fashion/perfum, Camembert, Trash/fun young, and I miss the last one? Just try to put right font to right stuff as people in Paris streets. <br> <br>*** <br> <br>Anyway, about country/typefaces, I will say that its more culture/typeface than anything else, and less and less possible to see anything, because the world became very small (from 20th). And also until recently, most of fonts we fond on computers came from US-German-English companies with strong technical restrictions. <br> <br>*** <br> <br>To answer to miguel, the best to him, depending from where he came is to take some traditionnal typefaces from his country as starting point to do a revival. More fun and culturally interesting for him and us. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>hrant, there is nothing i can say in opposition to you, since i respect your opinion more then i respect mine. but still, i don't fully comprehend your ideal. <br> <br>why dont you think the need for latinization is present both in the common people and in designers? <br>let me just tell you that i feel that the people of israel have reached a very 'western' way of living, which i think should have some proper reflection on our type. this will never translate into a demolition of the original forms, because there are plenty of designers who hold old-fashioned ideas about the hebrew type. my guess is that good hybrid hebrew will only enrich the market. <br></div>

The common people don't have any say in the matter. <br> <br>What I don't understand is why a 'western' way of living has to mean latinisation. What's the connection? <br> <br>Matha <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>it doesn't 'has to mean', and in fact, its far more complex then that. but everything is connected. news ads have a small selection form which they can choose a modern typeface, and they choose fonts that are most latinised. <br> <br>well. i think i shouldnt have talked about something i know so little about. its all comes from hunchs and simple thoughts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> good hybrid hebrew will only enrich the market. <br> <br>Itay, your hunches are right on. This is tricky stuff. You can't totally stop Latinization, and I think you don't even want to. But there is <i>something</i> very wrong about it, and at least people need to realize that when they make their design decisions. You're not getting something for nothing - you're giving up your individuality. What are you gaining? Something. Is it enough? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>in any timeline there are numerous up and downs, comebacks and what not. i dont think there is something we can lose forever in this field. we experiment, we move towards several directions. in the end, we have evolved, and thats what looks like the most importent thing to do. <br> <br>> But there is something very wrong about it, and at least people need to realize that when they make their design decisions. <br> <br>okey. i have realised that many times. but whatever I'll do, for every latinising designer here there'll be two conservative ones. the balance have remained until now, and it seems strong enough to procceed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Microsoft Typography Group shipped with Windows 2000 the first high-quality Unicode fonts for a number of complex scripts. <br> <br>In addition, the <a href=http://www.sil.org>Summer Institute of Linguistics</a> develops and distributes fonts for complex script minority languages as well as the tools to build, render and create documents with them, all inside the framework of the currently established TrueType file format. (It uses its own data tables separate from any OpenType feature tables.) <br> <br>While it is tempting to surrender logic to identity politics and blame Western cultural ignorance or indifference for the degradation of non-Latin scripts, I would argue that the greatest influence would be the economic and mechanical limitations of the kind of machinery available at the time that movable type spread across the globe. <br> <br>The great hope-affirming irony here is that computer programs written in languages based on the Latin script are being used to resurrect and reinvigorate non-Latin scripts. That has to count for something, doesn't it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the greatest influence would be the economic and mechanical limitations of the kind <br>> of machinery available at the time that movable type spread across the globe. <br> <br>It depends on the script. Some scripts (like Arabic) were made to give up more authenticity to foster material gain. Other scripts (like Armenian) have no problem with the mechanics, and become Latinized purely through misguided cultural idolatry. <br> <br>> That has to count for something, doesn't it? <br> <br>Sure, I for one think so. <br>It's just that different cultures are at a different point (and they can learn from the past mistakes of others). For example, Greek type suffered rapine in the 70s (mostly at the hands of its own people, if not always directly), but now it's coming into its own. Armenian type on the other hand went into "degenerative Latinization" about 10-15 years ago, and is still stuck there. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>In Ireland the blame for the initial latinisation and eventual disappearence of Gaelic type lies squarely on the shoulders of the printers. Using Gaelic type wasn't technically complicated. Unfortunately it represented an extra cost. <br> <br>To increase their margins they put pressure on the government to do away with Gaelic type and make roman standard. The Government wanted the votes and, Bob's your uncle, no more Gaelic type. <br> <br>Now that money is no longer a valid excuse, the printers claim that the reading public wouldn't be able to handle the exotic letterforms. <br> <br>Maybe one day the use of Gaelic fonts all over the world in texts about all things Irish might actually catch on in Ireland too. <br> <br>M <br> <br></div>
