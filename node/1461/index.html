That's not too much to ask, is it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today's student is tomorrow's font customer. But I agree - more emphasis needs to be placed on owning the fonts you use. Ultimately it's in the hands of the University to drive this point home.

		<div class="commentbody">An interesting idea, but one that I fear might not fly - as students are using the type to create portfolio projects, which eventually end up in front of a potential employer when they're fresh out of school. As a student, I'd prefer to do the typo-flipping myself, if it supported whatever typographic concept I was designing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the idea of watermarking, though. But what's the appropriate way to go about it?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most of the issue boils down to educators pushing the ethics of using fonts.

If you find someone who has fallen down the stairs, your first action is to stop the bleeding. Then you teach them how to hold on to the hand-rail. Reversing the sequence won't work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we don't give people a reason to stop stealing fonts, they won't stop. If the only reason to stop is a negative (&quot;If you don't stop we will sue you&quot;), it might stop a few people, but it will also engender a lot of ill-will and drive the practice underground. (Something I wonder about, but have no info: how many people have read the news articles about the actions of the RIAA and said:&quot;Kazaa? What's that? Cool! Where can I find it?&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stopping the bleeding won't be easy: there are too many fonts out there, and they can't be recalled or disabled. Most students, and most start-up designers, exist on a bare-bones budget. Encouraging them to spend money for fonts (&quot;Hmmm, Meta or Beer? Wow, that's a really tough choice!&quot;) is going to be very difficult. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The carrot doesn't have to be expensive. This is not a fully thought out action-plan, but here's a scenario: Provide design teachers w/ a CD full of exploded fonts (discussed above). Enclose on the CD bios of the font designers, descriptions of the fonts &amp; suggestions for proper usage, &amp; a discount coupon for unexploded versions of the font. Font designers get visibility (for marketing purposes, and to put a face on the victim of font piracy); students get new, interesting fonts to work with, teachers get tools &amp; opportunity to talk about piracy &amp; why it's a Bad Thing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;We should start a 12-Step Program For Font Addicts.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why?

In order to get the access, they have to agree to abstain from illegal file sharing. If they try to file-share, they get smacked with the stick &ndash; immediately. If they try again, they get smacked harder. If they try a third time, they get kicked off the network. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second page has a link to the Electronic Freedom foundation, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.eff.org/">http://www.eff.org/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> . It's kind of disheartening; since we (designers, producers &amp; vendors of type) are interested in the reduction of software piracy, we aparently are in league with &quot;&hellip; governments and corporate interests worldwide [who] are trying to prevent us from communicating freely through new technologies, just as when those in positions of power controlled the production and distribution of &ndash; or even burned &ndash; books they did not want people to read in the Middle Ages.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Sigh] <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
