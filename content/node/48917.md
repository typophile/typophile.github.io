  body: "[[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_qr/rialto_dft_full.gif|Here
    is a showing]] of the font from my Serif Font ID Guide. We have discussed this
    font before, and at that time there was only an e-mail to reach this foundry (no
    web site). The font family was quoted to be rather expensive ($560, if I recall).
    This sample was donated to me, and I do not have the font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thank you thank you, and how disappointing. I came across Rialto before in
    Robert Bringhurst's beautiful book "The Tree of Meaning." One of these days I'll
    just hold my breath and take the plunge...
