body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years out of the type scene, I'm glad
  to present Rebellia. It has been a joy to make some furious destroyed forms, so
  I hope you like it and the fonts can be useful for specific graphic contexts :-)\r\n\r\nIt
  is already available at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/rebellia/|MyFonts]].\r\n\r\nThe
  description:\r\nRebellia is a sans serif display type family designed in a aggressive
  grunge style. The family is composed by Rebellia Regular and Rebellia Dingbats that
  contains some drawings that follow the same destroyed visual language. Rebellia
  is suitable for titles, posters, fashion, t-shirts, covers, action movies, advertising
  and deconstructive things in general.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://outrasfontes.com/rebellia1.png\">"

  body: "Thank you, Jasper. \r\n\r\nLet's say that I'm also not a big fan of most
    grunge fonts found in the market. But one thing that motivates me in type design
    is to propose the challenge of doing something I have not done before. That's
    probably why I just can't follow a single style or trend. :-)\r\n\r\nMore of my
    work can be found here: http://www.outrasfontes.com"
