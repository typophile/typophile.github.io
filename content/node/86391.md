    my registration information, and they replayed after 30 days, confirming my registration.
    So be patient.\r\n\r\nCheers :)"

    takes a few days or in your case a week. Occasionally, they get flagged as spam
    and sent to a junk mail folder. Even those I usually catch up with eventually.
    \r\n\r\nFor others, if you don't hear from us, feel free to send a second email."
