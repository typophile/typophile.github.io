  body: 'Sorry for the delay. A couple of people sent me e-mail with guesses, but
    no one got it quite right. <BR> <BR>You are correct, William, in noting that the
    document is a palimsest: an earlier text has been erased and the new text written
    over it. <BR> <BR>The language of the text is Hebrew, but written in with Arabic
    letters. This is the direct reverse of the normal interaction between language
    and script, e.g. Yiddish, Ladino and Judaeo-Arabic, in which Jewish communities
    develop a dialect of majority local language&#40;s&#41; but write it using Hebrew
    letters. This example is stranger still, because although the text is written
    with Arabic consonants, the vocalisation is written with Hebrew <i>nikudot</i>
    &#40;vowel marks&#41;. The text is Biblical &#40;Exodus 1:12-22&#41; -- which
    makes the use of Arabic letters even more remarkable -- and also include <i>te&#39;amim</i>
    &#40;accents or cantillation marks&#41;. I wish I had a colour image: the letters
    are black, the nikudot are red, and the te&#39;eamim are green. I&#39;m not sure
    what colour the Arabic <i>shadda</i> marks are. The original manuscript is in
    the British Library, so I&#39;ll go look at it next time I am there. <BR> <BR>The
    likely history of this document is fascinating. It dates from the 10th or 11th
    century, and is a product of Karaitic Judaism, the anti-Talmudic competitor to
    Rabbinic Judaism. Colette Sirat notes: &#39;Certain Karaites considered the original
    written text to be identical with the true tradition of reading: it is not reasonable
    to think that certain of the divine words were written down in a certain way but
    must be read in another, as the masorah maintains. So as to remove any further
    ambiguity, some people decided to write the Bible in Arabic characters without
    the masorah, thus giving the only text that they considered authentic.&#39; It
    takes some doing to wrap one&#39;s head around this reasoning: only the original
    Hebrew consonantal text is authentic, and to better isolate this from latter readings
    we&#39;re going to write it in Arabic letters. <BR> <BR> <BR>See also: <BR> <BR>Sirat,

    they were as strong as the followers of Rabbanite Judaism during the 10th-12th

  body: '&#62;Christianity precedes Rabbanite Judaism <BR> <BR>This is only correct
    in a technical sense that the same outlook was called the Pharisee view before
    the fall of the Temple, and Rabbinic afterwards. Otherwise, it is not correct.
    The ethics of Jesus comes directly from the outlook of Hillel, a generation before,
    and the combination of the ethics of peace and kindness, and belief in afterlife
    judgment and resurrection - both of which are not typically biblical, but are
    Pharisee - were adapted by Christianity. This was understood by the Christian
    scholars G.T. Herford and G.F. Moore in the early twentieth century. They actually
    bothered to study the Talmud and therefore saw what is obvious if you know the
    literature.  <BR> <BR>The Christian views of sacrifice I think are more derived
    from and bear more resemblance to the pagan religions that Paul grew up among
    than the Temple sacrifices. &#40;The general Jewish view is that Paul invented
    Christianity.&#41; No doubt there are strands of first century Judean religions
    that survive in Christianity and not in Judaism and visa versa. They both came
    out of the same pot, but the stew already had a huge amount of Pharisee ingredients.
    <BR> <BR>I suspect that, as I guess Hrant means to indicate, the ideas of resurection
    and the end of days came into Judaism during the Bablyonian exile, with exposure
    to Zoroasterianism. These these became Jewish with the Pharisees, then part of
    Christianity, and finally Islam. The point is that the synthesis of the Biblical,
    Greek and Zoroasterian elements that make up the Rabbinic outlook was in place
    probably well over a hundred years before Jesus. <BR> <BR>But this doesn&#39;t

    the differentiation of what are typically lumped into single categories. This
    is the sort of thing that should appeal to you: the complexity of religious and
    cultural identity, as against a simplifying homogeneity. As William pointed out,
    Rabbanite Judaism is distinct religion from earlier Judaism: distinct on the basis
    of practice and teaching: a religion remade for a new condition. Of course, this
    too is a simplification. <BR> <BR>A religion is not a set of philosophical propositions
    that are believed or not believed. It is something that is lived &#40;Catholics
    are practising, Jews are observant, but the emphasis is the same: it is about
    doing, not just believing&#41;. Christians presumably agree on the divinity of
    Christ; beyond that the range of both belief and practice make it ridiculous to
    speak about Christianity as a religion. Catholicism is a religion. Orthodoxy is

    progress from Pharisetical to Rebbanite Judaism, but I do disagree with the above
    statement. The Christian view of sacrifice is directly related to that of the
    Jewish sin-offering or sacrifice of atonement. There isn&#39;t anything like this
    in Paganism, in which the whole concept of sin is largely missing. In Paganism
    you sacrifice because you want something or believe you need to placate an angry
    power. The idea of the Mass as re-presenting memorial and atoning sacrifice is
    directly related to distinctly Jewish belief and practice: the Passover Seder
    and the sin-offering. The unique aspect of the Mass -- distinct from both Pagan
    and Jewish sacrifice -- is that as a bloody sacrifice it happens only once, on
    Calvary. Every other Mass is a participation in that single sacrifice. <BR> <BR>Anyway,

    one religion with a large number of Churches.</i> <BR> <BR>It is perhaps a common
    <i>mis</i>-understanding. It is certainly contrary to the teachings of the Church.
    <BR> <BR>Adam, I suggest you go ask the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
    how many Churches there are. They will tell you there is <i>one</i> Church &#40;one,
    holy, catholic and apostolic, as the Nicence Creed says&#41;. Or ask them whether
    you are fulfilling your Sunday or Holy Day obligation by attending a Lutheran
    service. If you think you are practicing the same religion as a Lutheran, consider
    what the gifts of grace mean in the theology of those two very different religions.
    Since gifts of grace are received in the sacraments, it is obvious that Catholic
    and Lutheran sacraments are not the same thing &#40;quite apart from the fact
    that Catholics have seven sacraments and Lutherans have two&#41;. When Catholics
    and members of other religions meet together in ecumenical services, those services
    are expressly not sacramental in nature, unless the non-Catholics are explicitly
    attending a Catholic service as non-participating guests &#40;as when the Orthodox
    Ecumenical Patriarch attended Mass at St Peter&#39;s recently&#41;. And of course
    non-Catholics are not permitted to receive Catholic sacraments. The fact that
    some people in Germany -- and elsewhere, I know -- confuse ecumenism with syncretism
    shouldn&#39;t cloud the very clear teaching of the Catholic Church on all these
    matters. <BR> <BR>If Christianity were a single religion, I would not have felt
    the need to make the very difficult conversion from comfortable Anglicanism to
    far more demanding Catholicism. Perhaps some people raised in predominantly Catholic
    countries take their religion for granted, and don&#39;t grasp just how huge the
    gap is between Catholicism and other Christian denominations, because they&#39;ve
    never had to step across that gap. <BR> <BR> <BR>William, again, I define religion
    in terms of practice as much as belief. Of course, belief informs practice --
    or should --, and practice reflects belief -- or should. I too have found that
    faithful and observant people of different religions may have more in common with
    each other, in terms of temperament and values, than with weak-faithed and neglectful
    members of the same religion. But this is a interesting observation precisely
    because they are members of different religions. The faithfulness and observance
    is in the practice of the religion. I find it much easier to admire the Orthodox
    Jews I see walking many blocks to the synagogue on Shabbat than I do the Catholics
    who show up for Mass half an hour late and bolt out the door as soon as they&#39;ve
    received communion. In that sense of &#39;how individuals interpret their religion&#39;,
    I agree with you, but as my exchange with Adam should indicate, I think there
    are clear limits on the degree to which religion is a matter of personal interpretation.
    There are Protestant sects for people who want to make it up as they go along,
    but this is not Catholicism nor, as I understand, Judaism.

  body: <i>On religion, there are many more other serious variations within religious
    denominations in addition to level of observance of ritual.</i> <BR> <BR>I certainly
    didn&#39;t intend to equate practice of religion simply with observance of ritual.
    It is indeed possible to be slavishly observant of ritual yet lack charity or
    develop spiritually or, as a friend put it, to know all the rubrics yet live like
    an animal. I maintain that what determines a religion is form and matter &#40;which
    is a particularly Thomistic way of looking at it, I&#39;ll admit&#41;. The form
    and matter of Catholicism differs so completely from that of, for instance, Presbyterianism,
    that I think it is ridiculous to try to lump them together into a single Christian
    religion. The problem of this discussion may be, simply, that we lack a sufficient
    terminology to describe, at once, an historical set of shared beliefs and, in
    some cases, <i>similar</i> practices &#40;what Adam calls religion&#41; and also
    the very clearly distinct set of formal practices and material beliefs &#40;what
    I call religion&#41;. I&#39;m certainly not denying that both of these phenomena
    exist. Without the former, there wouldn&#39;t be any point in praying for Christian
    unity, but on the other hand how would you know such unity if you saw it? As agreement
    in form and matter. If, as Adam has, you apply the term religion to the shared
    beliefs, rather than to the distinct matter and form, you are left without a good
    term to label that which is distinct within this &#39;religion&#39;. You can,
    as Adam has, fall back on the term &#39;churches&#39;, which is certainly a common
    currency in Protestantism, but this is a terminology that runs directly counter
    to the explicit teaching of at least one of the distinct entities to which you
    are trying to refer. [And I admit being disturbed to see Adam at once describing
    himself as a Roman Catholic and stating a Protestant conception of multiple churches
    that is completely counter to Catholic teaching, and this is the only reason I&#39;m
    going on at such length.] The fact that a religion invented in Germany in the
    16th century inherited some core beliefs from the Catholic religion that it expressly
    sought to attack and undermine in every moral, social, economic and spiritual
    sphere, does not make them one religion. There&#39;s a lot of Judaism in all the
    Christian religions; that doesn&#39;t make a single Judaeo-Christian religion.
    There&#39;s a lot of both Judaism and Christianity in Islam; that doesn&#39;t
    make one big religion. It is the differences that define the religion.

    make it a &#34;very loose fit &#34;, even for Linotype. So I must ask you.  At
    a glance

  body: John -- <BR> <BR>Sorry I didn&#39;t look in on this earlier. I don&#39;t have
    my early Lino references here at TypeCon with me, but off the top of my head this
    looks like Old Style Number Seven &#40;or possibly Number One, sometimes I confuse
    them&#41;. If you can send me a larger sample &#40;off-forum and today or tomorrow,
    while I still have high-speed access&#41; I can compare it when I get home next
    week. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, I&#39;m really sorry not to be seeing you here this year.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Hrant, the descender length would have been determined by the Standard
    Alignment adopted by Lino. It doesn&#39;t move linearly across sizes. I can&#39;t
    remember what it is exactly for 7 or 8 point. I&#39;d have to check. <BR> <BR>Gerald,
    this 1912 sample would have pre-dated Griffith. And I don&#39;t think it was until
    after Griff that they started messing around with designing faces with longer
    descenders made on one alignment but meant to be cast on one-size-larger slugs.
    But I could be mistaken. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    <BR>What do you make of the vu in vultum? Top serif of the v is almost touching?
    Pretty thin matrice walls for either 7 or 8 point.  '

  body: Gerald -- true, that is awfully tight for a Lino matrix. Perhaps this is before
    they realized how quickly that would break down and adopted the wider minimums.
    But that&#39;s just a guess. <BR> <BR>John -- Then let&#39;s coordinate after
    I return home on Monday night. I&#39;ll send you a different e-mail that I use

  body: Kent, <BR> <BR>I am not sure we should assume it was set on a Linotype. For
    that matter, without a study,  how does Hrant, John, and yourself know this was
    not set on a Unitype, Typobar, Munson? Or even hand set with self spacing type.
    In other words, how many people have been jailed because the prosecution is too
    lazy. With three hundred &#34;typesetting sytem suspects&#34; why assume it was
    only one. Especially where there is evidence that contradicts the mechanics of
    a Linotype. <BR> <BR>Unlikely it would have been set on a Paige. There were only
    three of those made and all three remained in America. One still sits in the basement
    of Mark Twain&#39;s house, another was donated to the war effort by American Linotype.
    I am not sure of the other. But for good reason I suspect it was not set on a
    Paige Typesetting machine. <BR> <BR>That said, I have viewed this setting and
    determined by reason of mechanics, which system&#40;s&#41; it most likely was
    set on. Linotype is not impossible, just unlikely, very unlikely. Unless the word
    was cut, shaved and reassembled. That did happen, sometimes. <BR> <BR>But I am
    glad you are all here. What do you see in this illustration <a href="http://lanstontype.com/BurgessSetting.html"

    No. 7, the &#39;a&#39; is most similar to Old Style Antique. It doesn&#39;t show
    a full alphabet though, and the sizes of the Old Style numbers are 14 and 12 point.
    This is why I couldn&#39;t give a definite ID. The Wizards over at the type ID
    section might be able to crack it in short order if you want to post it there. '

  body: William, <BR> <BR>With this in mind my friendship with McMrew lead me to believe
    his expertise was hot  metal faces in America. <BR> <BR>Unless mistaken, John
    says,  <BR><i>Yes, I&#39;m guessing Linotype. The Missal was published in England,
    by Burns &amp; Oates, in 1912.</i>  <BR> <BR>I only know, or have &#34;knowledge
    of&#34; the legal dealings between American Monotype and English Monotype which
    at one time shared the same name. Are you suggesting that there was a &#34;different
    understanding with Linotype in American and Europe? Mike Parker indicates otherwise.

    Style, more than shown. In my earlier posting I mentioned that I checked Jaspert&#39;s
    book, which is English. They refer to &#39;Bookprint,&#39; not shown, as an English
    Linotype version. None of the showings of Lino Old Style have the characteristic

    guess is a foundry type - the foundry is listed as &#39;Keystone&#39;- does indeed
    have the &#39;a&#39;. But it doesn&#39;t have a full alphabet. Someone with more
