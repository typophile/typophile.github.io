  body: All of the repeating letters show slight differences so my guess is that it
    was hand drawn and not a font.

  body: 'If you have Adobe Illustrator, you can use the Image Trace function and it
    will do a pretty good job of creating a Bezier curve rendition of the image. With
    the exception of the capital ''M'', Adobe Caflisch Script (and its alternate characters)
    is fairly close to many of the letterforms in your sample. '
