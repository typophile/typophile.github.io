  was shown a picture of 3 or 4 different grotesque (properply incl. Berthold Akzidenz)
  'a' on top op each other. Each one was \"hatched\" or \"shaded\" - don't know the
  correct word i english - it was made up of lines. Each type the lines was in a different
  angle. One could clearly see where the fonts were different from one another - and
  in the middle, where it was nearly black, the form was an Helvetica 'a'. \r\n\r\nLately
  I've been looking for this picture but I can't seem to find it anywhere - internet
  or books. Does anyone know this picture and where it's form. \r\n\r\nIt's a little
  like this, which i found via google, but with more fonts:\r\nhttp://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/thumb/3/31/180px-Arial_Helvetica_overlay.svg.png\r\n\r\nSomehow
  I seem to remember that it was something used to help design Helvetica, but I not
  so sure that is right. Perhaps it's not even Helvetica in the middle, but just the
  average of a couple of the most popular grotesque fonts. But still I'm very interessed
  in the picture again."

    famous illustration</a> by [[Adrian Frutiger]], depicting the letter \u2018a\u2019
    in eight of the most widely used type styles, \u2018revealing the quintessence:
    [[Univers]]\u2019.\r\n\r\nNothing to do with Helvetica \u2013 but the country
    of origin and the year of birth. ;\xB0)\r\nF"

    It looks nicer in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Addendum: I looked it up in [[Adrian Frutiger|Frutiger]]\u2019s <em>Der Mensch
    und seine Zeichen [Signs & Symbols]</em>.\r\n\r\nRe Ondine: The typefaces he used
    for the layering chart are <em>not</em> Frutiger\u2019s own designs, but the \u2018most
    read\u2019, i.e.:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Garamond</li>\r\n<li>Baskerville</li>\r\n<li>Bodoni</li>\r\n<li>Excelsior</li>\r\n<li>Times</li>\r\n<li>Palatino</li>\r\n<li>Optima</li>\r\n<li>Helvetica/Univers
    [sic!]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAnd Frutiger doesn\u2019t claim that this chart would
    reveal his Univers as the quintessence, at least not ad verbatim.\r\n\r\nBtw:
    He did the same thing for \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018n\u2019."
