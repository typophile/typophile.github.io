  body: "Hi Ryuk, good find. \r\nAbout all I can offer is that this is a creation
    of Mecanorma during its photolettering years, based most probably on Art Nouveau
    letters dating to about 1900.But I have drawn a blank on who did the original
    letters and whether it was ever a pre photolettering font. Nothing in Solopedia,
    Luc Devroye etc. \r\nFor more fonts with this flavor I suggest Eckmann, Display
    Art One, Two & Three [Gerald Gallo] , Metropolitaines , Arnold B\xF6cklin, & Absinthe.
    \r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "Thank you. Thank you.\r\n\r\nWow, if Luc can't be sourced on this one I'm
    guessing that it must be original to the period. and from the glyph chart of Ortem
    it appears that the O was replaced by the zero.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n"

    or one of his associates],  or possibly French or Italian.\r\nDon"
