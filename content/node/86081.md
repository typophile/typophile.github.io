  typography on the web&rdquo;, which was published in Computers and Typography 2.
  In his essay he writes,\r\n\r\n&ldquo;...Verdana is a masterpiece of font design,
  a sans serif at small sizes where each pixel is critical, and a <strong>semi-serif
  in larger sizes</strong>.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIs there, or was there once upon a time,
  a semi-serif version of Verdana?"

    capital \u203AI\u2039, which is quite distinct in Verdana, when he wrote this."

  body: Ha, the exact same thing struck me when I read that bit today! I also wondered
    about the cap I, but it's only one character! It's quite a silly thing to say
    Verdana is a semi-serif, I think.

  body: And in any case, those serifs don't disappear at small sizes. What could Davidow
    be talking about?

  body: "Perhaps he is referring to the way that turning off font-smoothing at a small
    size threshold and rendering tiny text as a high-contrast pixel-font bitmap will
    render C, for instance, as three straight lines, with no \"semi-serifs\" at the
    terminals.\r\n\r\nThis is not font-specific; however the distinction for Verdana
    is that the small-size bitmap was designed that way, with separate size-specific
    forms, rather than having the pixel-font as a compromise or adjustment made to
    the \"proper\" higher-res iteration."
