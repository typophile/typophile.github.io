body: "Quick Question: I'm experimenting / learning about multiple master in fontlab.
  Works quite well for now, the only question i have: is there a way to tell fontlab
  to show a different master in the glyph overview window?\r\n\r\nI have a very simple
  test font that has a weight axis, with two masters, light and black (Wt0 and Wt1).
  Fontlab shows me Wt0 previews in glyph window. Sometimes i'd like to see Wt1 glyphs
  though ...\r\n\r\nI can \"rearrange masters\" from MM menu, and change the order
  of light and black, then the black one is shown. But isn't there a more ... non-editing
  way to do this?\r\n\r\nThere is the masters panel, where i can switch views of different
  masters (this is exactly what i want), but this only works in drawing and metrics
  windows, not in glyph window. the masters panel goes away if i go to glyph window,
  and it can't be activated (greyed out) in view menu.\r\n\r\nthanks for your help\r\nSebastian"

    seperately. I.e. the menu command \"delete mask\" seems to delete all masks of
    all masters. is there a way to delete only the one of the active master?"

  body: yes, mm handeling in FL is very ancient. Even if your masters are 100% compatible.
    MM building in FL changes often the startpoint numbering or loosing one point
    very close to an other point, so you have to work on and fix the genereted fonts
    to clean up things what could and should worked from start.

    to agree on some FL terms before going forward. What is the Drawing Window? I
    do all of my drawing in the Glyph Window and I am able to switch between masters
    quite easily. Perhaps when you say Glyph Window you are really referring to the
    Font Window. You can easily change the display of the Font Window by adjusting
    the MM sliders in Font Info.\r\n\r\nAs to FL MM being ancient. All you have to
    do is be precise when you create your outlines, pay attention to number and location
    of points. Tell FL never to add points and Never use the Blend Function to make
    an MM. Mask-to-Master is a much better way to go."

  body: "thanks, this was what i was looking for: the MM slider to set default.\r\n\r\n(yes,
    i was mixing up FL-terms ... I meant the font window, where i found no way to
    see all the glyphs in the master i wanted.)\r\n\r\nnow it works. for the moment
    at least :)"
