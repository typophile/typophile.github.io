body: In the attached PDF, Times New Roman is on top....TITUS Cyberbit Basic is on
  the bottom. Notice the subtle difference in the lowercase "a". Also, Titus has tighter
  horizontal spacing, although it's hard to tell in this example, and TITUS also has
  tighter line spacing

  body: One would think TITUS would have a better Arminian since it was partly designed
    by a language expert...go figure....That is if TNR has Armenian in it all. I presume
    TNR does not have Armenian in it at all, and you feel the TITUS adaptation for
    it is bad?

  body: "Yes, TNR does not include Armenian. There are many Armenian adaptations of
    Times, but none of them are any good (x-height colonialism/envy, too many serifs,
    enslaved \"\u0570\", too tight, etc. - the typical diseases).\r\n\r\nCyberbit's
    Armenian is not an adaptation, it's more like time-travel-dropping a medieval
    Armenian priest into a Reading University dormitory.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What I liked about TITUS Cyberbit Basic was that it was less condensed than
    the Times New Roman in the sample. I presume that's also a feature of Adobe's
    Times Ten.
