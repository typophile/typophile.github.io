  anything, but if anyone knows of any opportunities in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area,
  let me know. I&#39;m not picky as long as the lettuce is right!

  body: Thanks so much, everyone. I was very honored and pleased by all the help I&#39;ve
    gotten on this board and off it. One of my soon-to-be-former clients here at the
    agency dumped them becuase I was &#34;the only good thing&#34; here. Which I disagree
    with, but I appreciate the thought.
