body: "I downloaded the VSCOcam iphone app and discovered its beautiful typeface.\r\nHonestly,
  i cant get it over it. Curious as to whether anyone would possibly know what typeface
  it is?\r\nIf you need a better look, you can head over to their website [[http://vsco.co]].\r\n\r\nI
  dont have a lot of knowledge on typefaces, so any help would be appreciated.\r\nThanks"
