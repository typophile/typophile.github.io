  good enough with visual details to figure it out myself.  I'm looking particularly
  at the bottom part that lists cities, if it's not all one font.  Also, if it isn't
  a standard font, where can I get it?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the sub-line is actually Garamond 3 or possibly some other Garamond,
    but not ITC Garamond.\r\n\r\nI also think you're on the right track with Baskerville,
    but maybe not ITC, which has more cupped serifs."
