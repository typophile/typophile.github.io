  for some reason I keep hitting a wall on this topic. The strongest opposition to

  body: "Hanging stuff is often indeed taken so far that it looks wrong. To me, putting
    quotes completely outside the paragraph block is a design affectation. The reason
    to hang puctuation is to reduce gaps; causing a proportional black spec in the
    other direction is not a solution. So there has to be balance, visually. Basically,
    people aren't even supposed to notice anything is going on at all, much less bother
    to form opinions that it's \"right\" or \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    puctuation has several levels of implementation and means different things to
    different designers. All forms of punc refinement was integral to the \"house
    style\" when I was in charge of advertising at Compugraphic/Agfa Type Division
    many years ago. We were trying to impress the high-end typography market, so all
    of the work had to be exemplary. \r\n\r\nI rarely see such diligence of this level
    in today's print, and yes, most consider it to be a violation as opposed to a
    refinement.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old,
    that's why my punc is hanging!"

      where the construction of the project isn't done by me and this is the first
      time that everyone has heard this request and I'm getting fought on the issue.
      I'd prefer to do it myself to have total control, but alas my new environment
      doesn't work that way. So that means I have to make a strong debate. Hence my
      request here.\r\n\r\nThanks for the links, I'll read them soon. But everyone
      keep the comments coming if you have something to say!\r\n\r\n-Randy"

    by the point size, the typeface, and the final way in which it will be viewed.

  body: "Gutenberg Bible hangs hyphens, but they're much lighter in weight, and hyphens
    hang on the right side, which is usually not the dominant edge of a paragraph
    (but it could be).\r\n\r\nI think hanging looks great in headlines, callouts,
    quoting poetry, or some other special type treatment (which is almost always in
    larger type sizes). However, with regular text sizes, just because of the shape
    of the character, you either have a space going in or a mark going out. It's anyone's
    opinion as to which is the stronger line. If one can ignore the mark, why not
    ignore the space?\r\n\r\nEven in larger text sizes for paragraphs, say a children's
    book or information for elderly, you usually won't need to hang punctuation. The
    example below is an extreme case of what could happen with quotes. In 13 pt text
    (ugh) I increased paragraph indents from my usual em to 15 pts, so that the indents
    stand out when quote marks on following lines or quotes at the beginning of following
    indented lines occur. Even when it's a combo of quote-W, a little kerning is pretty
    much all you need. There's been times I did hang indents that started with a quote
    mark, (like the \"Eu in the example) but if you do, just be consistent throughout
    the entire text.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://mywebpages.comcast.net/brian912/linked/typoImages/Untitled-1.html\"

    haven't yet experimented with the 'size' feature in the 'story' dialogue box,
