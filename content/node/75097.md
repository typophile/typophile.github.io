body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've got a client who's been set up with a look and feel by an
  agency which they have now asked me to take on and continue. The company is a fund
  management company so reasonably dry and corporate but a new company with young
  heads. \r\n\r\nTheir initial collateral has been set in Chronicle ( http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032
  ) a tidy corporate font in my opinion. Problem is, since they've parted ways with
  their agency, they've been using Georgia, the PC default and are now asking me to
  set an 80 page doc in this clunky font. \r\n\r\nTheir overall look and feel is very
  sophisticated and typographically pleasing. As they deal in millions and billions
  I'm hoping to convince them to buy me the font but am curious to hear if anyone
  could suggest an alternative that I could establish as their default print font.\r\n\r\nReasons
  for the request are\r\na) tight deadline, and I would like to set some pages of
  their document in the font to show them that:\r\n\r\nb) It's ok for emails and print
  material to be set in different fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I generally dont
  agree with a company's main copy font being the same as used in their logo - what
  do you think? I feel you lose contrast between the copy and logo.\r\n\r\nThank-you
  in advance for reading my long-winded request"

  body: "Thanks for your concern oldnick. However they are a dependable company estranged
    from their agency as attention-to-detail errors had started to creep in which
    were unacceptable for them give the nature of the documents.\r\n\r\nAnd they've
    agreed to buy Chronicle! The only concern for them was consistency between their
    material printed in-house from word or powerpoint and their designed materials."
