  Symbol).\r\nMy question is: do you know where I can get images of the book's inside?\r\nThe
  Google Scholar don't have any...\r\nI suspect that there are some copyrights issues
  but want to check it anyway...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"

  body: "Ant\xF3nio -\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it is exactly the same book, but
    Frutiger's \"Sinais e S\xEDmbolos\" is available here in Brasil from Martins Fontes
    Editora (in Portuguese, of course). I quote from the review:\r\n\r\n\"N\xE3o existem
    elementos casuais em nosso redor ou dentro de n\xF3s, mas toda mat\xE9ria obedece
    a uma composi\xE7\xE3o ordenada. At\xE9 o tra\xE7o ou o rabisco mais inocente
    n\xE3o pode existir acidentalmente, por puro acaso, mesmo que o observador n\xE3o
    reconhe\xE7a claramente as causas, a origem e o motivo desse \"desenho\". \xC9
    a partir de considera\xE7\xF5es como essas que Adrian Frutiger leva o leitor a
    reconhecer e julgar com mais facilidade a origem, o sentido e a mensagem dos sinais
    e s\xEDmbolos.\"\r\n\r\nTake a look at http://www.martinsfonteseditora.com.br/detalhes.asp?ID=552685
    and Boa sorte!\r\n\r\nRonald  Kyrmse\r\nronald.info.ms"

  body: $250 seems like a fair price. If it is beyond your means, perhaps you should
    go in with a few colleagues and share the cost and the access.

  body: Also, several years ago I posted a couple of images form the book, as examples
    of weighting-up type. If you search Typophile, I'm sure you can come up with them.

    the United States public library system... but international libraries may be
    a different matter. Here are two links which may be helpful to someone living
