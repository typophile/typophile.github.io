  piece to Chinese and the client requested a font called Kaiti. I see \"Kaiti SC\"
  in the font list but when we select it the font doesn't display in Chinese. What
  are we doing wrong?\r\n\r\nI read on this site that we might have trouble exporting
  a PDF using this font. Is that still true? \r\n\r\nWe running InDesign 2014 on a
  Mac running Yosemite. We use Font Explorer X Pro too.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be
  greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChrista"

    \"Kai Ti\" in its name is one with accompanying \"ruby\" for every character -
    not useful for general purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the AR PL ZenKai Uni fonts also
    appear suitable."

    you elaborate? What happens when you apply the font to a Chinese text? In what
    form you receive the Chinese texts to import in InDesign?"

    and paste it in InDesign, Kaiti SC renders it properly, then the problem is not
    due to Kaiti but most probably to the encoding of the file you were given. For
    instance, I took the text http://typophile.com/files/text-gb2312.txt from <a href=\"http://www.bmo.com/s_chinese/home/home.html\">www.bmo.com/s_chinese</a>
    which is GB2312 encoded and saved it as plain text. If you open the .txt file
    with your browser, you will most probably need to choose <code>view &gt; text
    encoding &gt; Simplified Chinese (GB 2312)</code> so that it displays properly.\r\n\r\nAdded:
    the  very same line of Chinese text can also be found in <a href=\"/files/text-bm-utf8.txt\">text-bm-utf8.txt</a>;
    this time however you need to select the encoding Unicode (UTF-8) to view it.
    To get that new file, I just opened with TextEdit the previous GB 2312 encoded
    text  and saved it in the UTF-8 encoding."
