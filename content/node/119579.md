  time poster, here.  Just did comprehensive search of the forums for similar questions,
  and understandably found only a few on target (last one back in 2011).]\r\n\r\n\r\nHi
  all,\r\n\r\nI appreciate any guidance you might provide on this matter --- I'm trying
  to select a typeface for the burial headstone for a close female family member (passed
  away at ripe old age).  I'd like the typeface to convey a sense of her strong family
  ties, as well as her great warmth combined with her no-nonsense/resilient approach
  to life.\r\n\r\nContext: my strong preference would be to find an actual stone-carver
  and let him do his magic, but that's cost prohibitive, especially since the cost
  of this sandblasted headstone is already included in the overall package price of
  the burial.  Alas, the funeral home seems to have a very poor aesthetic --- everything
  is Times Roman (with truly terrible kerning).  Long story short, I'm trying to prevent
  such a design memorializing a loved-on for perpetuity, by providing a camera-ready
  layout myself (the funeral home will then cut my layout into granite).  I'm by no
  means a professional graphic designer, but I'm at least reasonably comfortable with
  my own aesthetic.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've been selecting potential typefaces from among
  those I already own (all within Adobe's Font Folio), as I'm best able to tell if
  they're a good match by setting the actual full headstone (name, dates, message,
  etc) in the typeface (and I don't want to needlessly purchase typefaces just to
  explore).  That being said, if I'm convinced I should use one I don't own, I can
  purchase something / anything extra.\r\n\r\nOne direct question, and then one that's
  more open-ended:\r\n\r\n  (1) Some of the typefaces that made my final round are
  part of Adobe's Opticals collection (which means I own them in caption, sub-head,
  text, and display optical sizes).  While normally I would imagine that the display
  type should be used for such a huge element (100s of points), I'm not sure if similar
  logic should be transferred from the realm of \"ink on paper\" to \"cuts in granite\".
  \ Obviously, display types generally have increased stroke contrast (compared to
  text types), and this seems like a potentially complicating factor for stone-cutting
  (sandblasting, in my case).\r\n\r\n      Your thoughts on this, please?  Should
  I just ignore the actual size of the type, and select a \"text\" type from within
  the Opticals collection?\r\n\r\n  (2) I'm open to suggestions on typefaces beyond
  what I've considered, please.  Currently, my final list is:\r\n\r\n        Adobe
  Jenson Pro Opticals\r\n        Adobe Kepler Std Medium Opticals\r\n        Adobe
  Goudy Old-Style Bold\r\n\r\n      I've reviewed every font mentioned on the three
  existing Typophile forum threads on this topic, and a number of them are either
  too stylized, or too \"sans serif\" to fit the overall (but definitely not exactly
  uniform) style of other markers within our family plot. However, I did like the
  following typeface suggestions made in other threads:\r\n\r\n        Centaur\r\n
  \       Adobe Minion\r\n        ITC Golden Cockerel Titling\r\n        Bitstream
  Iowan Old-Style\r\n        Albertus\r\n\r\n      and will consider adding these
  to the pile under consideration (of course, I already own the ones on my current
  final list, and don't own any of these new ones, but I can handle that as necessary).\r\n\r\n
  \     One final note, FWIW: the headstone will also include some Hebrew (actual
  typeface currently undecided and likely subject of a separate forum thread after
  I finalize this choice).\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration, and any thoughts
  or assistance is gratefully received...\r\n"

    the technical requirements, but I think you're right to steer clear of display
    weights\u2014too much contrast, which isn't optimal for the process.\r\n\r\nJenson,
    Kepler, Minion, Golden Cockerel (roman though, not titling), and Iowan are all
    good choices. Nice to see some uncommon names here, and all are sturdy faces.\r\n\r\nGoudy
    and Centaur have too much contrast for my taste, and Albertus is a bit too expected
    for this application. But those are just my personal opinions."

    body: "Thanks so much for the input.\r\n\r\nWould indeed be great to get input
      from the person doing the sandblasting of this stone.  Alas, they are \"computer-button
      pressers\", and seem to understand little more than that.  sigh...  When I tried
      to speak with them, I had to explain what \"kerning\" meant, what \"stroke contrast\"
      was, what a \"sans serif\" versus \"serif\" typeface was, etc, etc.  They simply
      punch the stone's message into their computer, position the granite stone, and
      hit a button.  Were it not for the case that the stone is effectively already
      paid for (with this existing funeral home), I'd obviously find someone else
      to do the work.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your comments --- I want to digest further
      your thoughts on typeface selection."

  body: "Hi.  I rarely post here because I' a signpainter and calligrapher so I don't
    work with much text, mostly work with display fonts and hand lettering, including
    wood sign carving.  But I have designed a couple of gravestones and the folks
    who sand blasted them liked my designs because I have seen enough blasting of
    several materials to \"feel\" how it's done.  When blasting granite, which is
    a very very hard stone, you don't want the masking stencil to be worn down or
    the interior pieces (the bowls, etc.) to be blown away.  So don't go any smaller
    than you have seen done successfully elsewhere and just try to think of how to
    make it reasonably easy for the person who wields the nozzle. (Actually having
    to execute much of my work makes me a better designer.  What worked for Gill,
    works for me.)\r\n\r\nGoudy extra bold looks great, is traditional and blasts
    very easily.  One local gravestone company even uses a slightly modified Goudy
    extra bold for their work.  They didn't divulge the exact modifications but I'll
    look closer next time.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I think Goudy would look great
    used with a Hebrew font.\r\nJust keep in mind the lettering can be a bit \"busy\"
    looking because of highlights and shadows.\r\nI hope the funeral home will tell
    you if any aspect of your design will be excessively difficult to produce.  Maybe
    you'd like to post your design here on this forum."
