body: "In learning about typefaces, I have always been taught that small capitals
  are not merely scaled-down versions of caps, but are their own entity, so that the
  stroke weight is proper. (Sad to say too many fonts don't contain proper small caps.)\r\n\r\nBut
  anyway, is the same theory true for superscript and subscript figures? What I mean
  is, should there properly be separate figures created for superscripts and subscripts
  whose stroke weight matches the characters around them, instead of just using miniatureized
  regular figures? I've never seen a font that had these.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering
  what is in theory the most correct way, and in practice how it is done.\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: "The same applies, they'll be optically scaled down.  This means they can
    be:\r\n\r\na) a bit heavier than normal\r\nb) a bit wider than normal\r\nc) a
    larger x-height than normal\r\nd) a & b; b & c; a & c; or a, b, & c.\r\n\r\nA
    good math font will have this done.  The problem design wise is its hard to really
    know which letters might come up in superscript/subscript situations.  I think
    in one thread we collected a list o the typical ordinals which was close the entire
    alphabet.  Diacritics will need to be resized since they too can be used on super/subscripts."

  body: "These have always been available as separate characters, properly sized,
    weighted, and positioned.\r\nIn the days of metal and photoset type, only a few
    typefaces had them.\r\nIn the first days of digital, they were available for a
    limited number of text types as separate \"Expert\" fonts.\r\nSince OpenType,
    the practice of providing them has become much more widespread, for instance I
    have included them in all fonts of my six most recent non-script typefaces.\r\n"
