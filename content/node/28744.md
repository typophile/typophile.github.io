  body: "The only reason it should do that is if you are inserting proper hyperlinks
    into the document: just typing in a URL using my InDesign CS 3.0.1 Mac doesn't
    do that at all.\r\n\r\nHave you tried going into \"View\" then \"Hide Hyperlinks\"?\r\n\r\nLinda"

  body: It seems like if you delete the link instance in the Hyperlinks pallete and
    then manually change it from blue to black and de-underline, it gets fixed. I
    still think there should be a way to change the settings to NOT do it automatically.

    go through whatever text I''ve got to place and strip out all that stuff before
    I even put it into InDesign.  :-)'

  body: It automatically put it in there. I didn't even KNOW there was a hyperlinks
    pallette until I was trying to get RID of it.

  body: "Yeah, it's a \"feature\" of CS: I can't remember if it was in 1.5 or 2, but
    I don't think so.  As far as I know, it's not something that can be turned off
    either: I'd love someone to prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nI think I noticed they got
    imported early on, and then, as a matter of course, I just added \"kill unneeded
    hyperlinks\" from my regular routine of cleaning up text/Word files before importing,
    along with \"remove extra spaces after periods\" and \"reformat tables lined up
    with multiple spaces or tabs.\"  I've got it down to a system now, since I found
    it way easier than trying to train publications-illiterate clients.  ;-)\r\n\r\nLinda\r\n\r\nLinda"

    think you'll find that there's a character style defined for hyperlinks in your
    doc: edit it to remove the colour."

  body: I suggested editing rather than deleting since urls often need special treatment,
    like the no break attribute.
