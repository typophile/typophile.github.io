  body: "As you can see from the differences between repeating letters, this is probably
    handmade.\r\nI don't know if it's based on some old font of the era and if this
    font is actually digitized, so I suppose your best chance is to find something
    similar in style & contrast.\r\n\r\nIf nobody else finds something closer, take
    a look on the following similars:\r\n<strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/cotoris/|Cotoris
    (Bold)]]</strong> by Ryoichi Tsunekawa [Flat-it type, 2006]\r\n<strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/anewmachine/holt-sans/|Holt
    Sans]]</strong> by  Kent Swecker [A New Machine, 2012]"

  body: "The sign maker would have been familiar with Dutch lettering artists. Some
    of their work has been fonted. For a comprehensive review of Dutch fonts see Luc
    Devroye's page on Dutch type design http://luc.devroye.org/holland-index.html
    I know I have seen something like that _R_ in a Dutch font, but I can't recall
    the name.\r\nDon"

    If you can edit fonts you could make this one into a pretty passable imitation
    by thickening parts of the hairlines.\r\nDon"
