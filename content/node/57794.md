  body: "The traditional Arabic calligraphic classification (shesh qalam) is not at
    all analagous to the Latin typographic one. \r\n\r\nMany of the Islamic calligraphic
    styles do not even survive in mechanized, typographic form. Surprisingly, perhaps,
    Kufi is among them. Typefaces that are sold as Kufi today do not have the characteristics
    of early Arabic. At best they can be described as nostalgic artist's impressions
    on the basis of simplified Arabic.\r\n\r\nEarly European attempts to produce Arabic
    typography, seen from a Middle Eastern, i.e., a user's perspective, have no relevance
    for the development of mechanized Arabic script. The reason is that 1. the designers
    cross-bred between the classic styles en 2. had no knowledge of the \"script grammar\".
    As a result, no such European design ever gained acceptance in the Middle East
    (with the possible exception of some Christian evangelist communities).\r\n\r\nFrom
    the great calligraphic styles only Nastaliq, Ruq`ah, Thulth saw 19th century Middle
    Eastern typographic adaptations, but they are all extinct now (although there
    are some great computer-aided revivals produced in Iran and Pakistan). It was
    local Naskh typography that provided the point from where all modern Arabic typography
    derives - that's why the traditional calligraphic classification plays no role.\r\n\r\nThe
    20th century Western industrial approach to Arabic, however, has hi-jacked practically
    all the Naskh-based developments. The western design focus was and still is \"simplification\",
    a euphemism for imposing Latin-based criteria without even bothering to figure
    out why Middle Eastern users do not consider their own script \"complicated\".
    \r\n\r\nThe latest development in this trend is to abandon Arabic characteristics
    all together and base the shapes completely on Latin typefaces, according to the
    professed ideal of certain Western-educated Arab designers.\r\n\r\nOnce that revolutionary
    process is completed - it may require more than just another troop surge - anyone
    can classify Arabic typography completely with Latin-based categories: Arabic
    Blackletter, Arabic Glyphic, Arabic Neo-Grotesque.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, all
    this doesn't answer the question about true classification of Arabic typography.
    The truth is, it's not yet been done.\r\n\r\nOne prerequisite is, imho, a thorough
    understanding of Arabic \"script grammar\", the exhaustive analysis and description
    of the traditional contextual shaping system, something that I hope to contribute
    to. It will help to define the difference between locally produced \"grammatically\"
    consistent typography, and foreign imports, usually much less informed random
    collections of ligatures.\r\n\r\nThomas Milo\r\nDecoType\r\nwww.decotype.com"

  body: "Further to what Tom has written -- with which I completely agree -- the collapse
    of Arabic typography into a horizontal line of minimal shape variants has resulted
    in attempts at typeface classification based upon only superficial similarities
    to calligraphic styles. Hence, we get classifications like 'Neo-Naskh' and 'Neo-Kufi'
    that distinguish the kind of shapes and details one sees in the letters while
    ignoring the fact that they are implemented with identical mechanical models that
    bear no relationship to the distinct grammars of the styles whose names they borrow.\r\n\r\nLatin
    typography happened to develop during a period when the contemporary formal manuscript
    hands involved relatively little interaction between letters, and the principle
    typographic styles derived from those models further reduced this interaction
    until \u2018ligatures\u2019 became only very occasional exceptions to the sequential
    arrangement of individual letters in a line. But these are not the only models
    of Latin writing, nor are they the only ones to be represented in type, nor are
    they the \u2018end of the line\u2019, the peak of evolutionary adaptation: scribes
    before and since have invented new ways of writing. There are styles of Latin
    writing that have grammars as complex as Arabic naskh, grammars that determine
    what forms of letters connect to what other forms, what kinds of connection are
    forbidden, how to disambiguate similar letters, etc. When these styles have been
    reduced to typography, they have tended to be simplified for mechanical purposes:
    a typeface like 'Shelley Allegro' is to the 18th century roundhand of George Shelley
    what a 'neo-naskh' is to real naskh.\r\n\r\nToday, we have technologies that allow
    us to much more accurately capture the grammar of a script style in typographic
    form. This suggests to me new systems of classification based on structural analysis
    rather than on superficial details.\r\n\r\nBut see also http://typophile.com/node/9757

  body: "> He said it\u2019s like our archaeologic treasures. We have to rely on westerners
    to discover and introduce us better to our history.\r\n\r\nI think there is enough
    appreciation and understanding of the calligraphic legacy within the Arab/Muslim
    world. The problem lies in the divide between those who have a full understanding
    of the aesthetics and mechanism of the script, and current technology. \r\n\r\nWhat
    Arabic typography needs is a vision of how the script interacts within the realms
    of visual communication today, independent of technical constraints. Between ACE
    and OpenType, we designers can focus more on the design: what we actually *want*
    to design, rather than what current technology will allow us to.\r\n\r\nThe Latinization
    going on within Arabic branding and advertising design is deplorable, and the
    results hideous. But at the same time, we need not be afraid to play a little
    bit. The most important is to have a deep understanding and appreciation for the
    script, its various styles, and the basic concepts of type design.\r\n\r\nWhether
    we love or hate the body of work available today, we still need to be able to
    classify it. For my PhD studies, I refer to Simplified Naskh (as developed by
    Linotype in the 50's and usually characterized by Yakout) which mostly has 2 contextual
    forms per character, Traditional Naskh which has 4 forms and a number of ligatures
    (good example is Lotus), and Calligraphic Naskh with multiple dynamic forms such
    as Decotype Naskh powered by Tasmeem. \r\n\r\nThis is very basic classification
    based on a quantitative approach. It can be further developed of course. This
    approach does not have a judgmental aspect to it so it does not try to elevate
    one style over the other. It merely counts the variants."

  body: "Nadine, I think the quantitative approach is a reasonable one to take to
    the results of the technology, but the labels are problematic. Since the technical
    simplification applied in Yakout isn't limited to styles that evoke naskh in their
    stroke construction, I'd be inclined to call this \u2018Simplified Arabic\u2019,
    rather than Simplified Naskh. And the label \u2018Traditional\u2019 doesn't seem
    to me to fit with the four-shape model, since there isn't a single traditional
    style in which this is the case. So perhaps, taking a purely technical view of
    this model, we might call this \u2018Basic Arabic\u2019, in that it corresponds
    to the common, and Unicode, description of Arabic dual- and right-joining forms.
    Following this approach, I would probably call the DecoType Naskh something like
    \u2018Analytical Arabic\u2019 or \u2018Grammatical Arabic\u2019 in that it seeks
    to capture the full set of rules that governs a particular style of the script.
    This suggests a fourth category of hybrid fonts that build on top of Basic Arabic
    but either do not attempt to capture the full rule-set of a style or fail to do
    so. I would call these \u2018Synthetic Arabic\u2019; the Microsoft Arabic Typesetting
    font would be an example."

    on the planet?\r\nMany languages of Arabic script don't even have the meager luxury
    of choosing between few fonts. They have to use Tahoma that covers them all. And
    also because it sustains best the poor visual rendition of the text in small size
    on PC screens, for their lack of antialiasing.\r\nThis is not about elitism. It's
    the foundation of a culture that is at stake. A culture that has Siaah Mashgh
    (black draft) which is a textual composition that isn't even meant to be read.
    Just to be looked at.\r\nNow I am certainly not suggesting that Arabic typography
    should address such art forms. They should remain in creative hands of artists.
    What I'm suggesting is that a culture, with such high value for textual design,
    should not and will not be reduced to Tahoma, which has effectively numbed the
    sense of aesthetics of a whole generation."

  body: "John, you raise good points. The terms I mentioned were specifically focused
    on analyzing the body of existing Naskh typographic styles. This is why I use
    modifiers for the term Naskh. You are right to note though that this approach
    could fit other styles too. For Traditional Naskh, my reasoning was that this
    4-form analysis was the traditional typographic approach to rendering Naskh. I
    have also noticed that Fiona used that term in the Lotus font description. So,
    the \"traditional\" is referring to typographic history and not the calligraphic
    one. For the Calligraphic, both \"grammatical\" and \"analytical\" are viable
    options. I'm not very happy with the term \"calligraphic\" as it seems to refer
    to the design and not the construction method.  I'm thinking the term \"dynamic\"
    might be better. Thankfully I have some time before I have to decide!\r\n\r\nYou
    are right regarding the 4th category. The OpenType features add sophistication
    which is not there in the first 2 categories. It's sort of Traditional+ since
    it still maintains the 4 forms as the basic analytical approach."

  body: "Benham: <em>And what category would be Arabic Tahoma? The most viewed Arabic
    typeface on the planet?</em>\r\n\r\nFrom a variant-quantitive perspective, this
    is Basic Arabic, and a good demonstration that this classification system deliberately
    avoids distinguishing design styles. A secondary classification system describing
    styles can be appended. So you have a two-part descriptor: one for the methodology
    of the technical implementation and one for the style of letter. I suspect the
    French terminology for Latin types adapts better to Arabic than the English terminology,
    which is too much concerned with the presence of absence of serifs. Hence, Tahoma
    might be called something like Basic Lineal.\r\n\r\nNadine: <em>For Traditional
    Naskh, my reasoning was that this 4-form analysis was the traditional typographic
    approach to rendering Naskh.</em>\r\n\r\nBut was it? It is certainly the mechanical
    typographic approach, but the evidence of Analytical Arabic implementations in
    handset metal type originating in the Ottoman context can't be ignored. This is
    why I think the term Traditional is inappropriate: the typographic tradition is
    too diverse for this to be a useful term."

    for the 4-form category. It implies that this is the minimum requirement though

    important one of the three was claimed by French Archaeologist Dusad, in 1902,
    to be the epitaph of King Umru' al-Qays bin Amru. My article (http://arabetics.com/more/History_of_the_Arabic_Script_article.htm)
