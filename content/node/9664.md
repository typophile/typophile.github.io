body: Maybe someone with some experience in this field could offer me a few pointers.  I&#39;m
  curious about the rules when it comes to digitizing od type from let&#39;s say the
  Solotype Catalog.  Do you have a right to do it?  If so, do you have a right to
  sell it?  And is it common to keep the old name, and include all the facts that
  you know about the design in the font file?  I&#39;ve found a sub-par digital font
  of the typeface I&#39;m interested in already, but I would like to make my own,
  and maybe even sell it if it turns out nicely.  Also create some accented characters,
  currency signs, etc. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?  Sorry for all the questions.

  body: With regards to the name, it&#39;s a question of whether that name is trademarked
    and owned by somebody. Many of those really old typefaces aren&#39;t but that
    isn&#39;t true of all of them. Plus, so many names are in use that some other
    typeface may have the same name. For example, there&#39;s an old ATF face that
    I&#39;d like to see a revival of. But Monotype has a typeface, issued about 90
    years later, with the same name. The later typeface has a current trademark. <BR>
    <BR>With the design, there are both legal and ethical issues. Both of these vary
    depending on the history and age of the design, and the legal stuff can vary depending
    on where you are. <BR> <BR>None of this should be taken as being legal advice,
    just some general background info. <BR> <BR>The design you&#39;re interested in
    is how old? <BR>What was the original type foundry? <BR>Who has a digital version
    of it today, and do they claim a trademark on the name? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: 'Again, I&#39;m not a lawyer, but here&#39;s my take: <BR> <BR>The only real
    legal issue is with trademarks. There is no legal protection, at least in the
    US, for typeface designs themselves &#40;with the rare and time-limited exception
    of design patents&#41;. As long as you&#39;re doing your own digitization, you
    can do whatever you like with the font, including sell it. <BR> <BR>The <i>ethical</i>
    issues are a different story altogether. I have been putting some thought into
    the ethics of typeface revivals, but I imagine others here will disagree, perhaps
    even sharply. <BR> <BR>To me, the main ethical issues to balance are contributing
    to the pool of quality fonts, and stepping on someone else&#39;s moral ownership
    rights. <BR> <BR>Both of these questions can be somewhat murky, but I think there
    are some clear guidelines. <BR> <BR>If the designer of the font is still alive,
    they have moral ownership rights. For the vast majority of fonts in the Solotype
    books, the original designer is long gone, and any moral ownership of the design
    has completely faded. I can imagine some ambiguous cases, such as when there are
    collaborators who are still living, or when the original font was commissioned
    by an entity that still exists. <BR> <BR>Making a font of exceptional quality
    is a strong ethical justification. If there is a company selling a crappy digitization,
    they have relinquished much of their moral ownership rights, regardless of the
    legal issues. On the flip side, releasing a poor quality font which saps away
    sales from a foundry which caring lovingly for its revivals is a bad thing. <BR>
    <BR>If the digital version available today is put out by a reputable foundry,
    then I think the friendly thing to do would be to offer them first refusal on
    your digitization. That way, everybody benefits, not least the users of the face.
    <BR> <BR>If the name is available, by all means keep it. In any case, give as
    much attribution as possible. I&#39;m not sure how important it is to stuff that
    in the font file itself though. <BR> <BR>As you can probably tell, I&#39;m struggling
    with some of the same questions myself. I&#39;m trying to make a digital version
    of the original metal Centaur. While it&#39;s intimidating to try to do justice
    to a typeface of this magnitude and importance, I feel that the outlines I have
    drawn so far are much better than the current digital version, and in any case
    I absolutely love working with such beautiful letterforms. It goes slowly for
    a number of reasons, but I&#39;m hopeful that eventually it will be seen as a
    real contribution. <BR> <BR>In any case, best of luck! <BR> <BR>Thomas: what ATF
    face are you thinking of, if I may ask?'

    The typeface that I&#39;m interested in digitizing is an old display face from
    what I believe the 1800&#39;s.  And I have to confess I don&#39;t know much at
    all about the typeface or its whereabouts.  For those who have Dan X. Solo&#39;s
    Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Faces it can be found on page 116 and it&#39;s
    named Victorian Stencil.  It&#39;s a rather charming ornamental stencil face with
    a western feel to it.  I&#39;ve checked several online font outlets and none has
    a font with the same name, and I didn&#39;t find anything while Googling either.  &#40;I&#39;d
    be happy to make a scan and post it here.&#41; <BR> <BR>The digital version that
    I&#39;ve seen is done by Jeff Levine and can be found at <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=maverick"
    target="_blank">Dafont.com</a> &#40;named Maverick&#41;.  And I wouldn&#39;t really
    want to be inspired by this digitization too much.  But the problem is that that
    the Solotype Catalog does not have the full character set. <BR> <BR>Stephen: I
    checked out all the Solotype fonts on Myfonts and this one wasn&#39;t there.  Anybody
    know the names of all the fonts that came with the Dover CD&#39;s? <BR> <BR>Ralph:
    Thanks!  I believe that the creator if this typeface is long gone, but I don&#39;t
    have any information to collaborate this with.  And Dan X. Solo doesn&#39;t seem
    to be in business any longer so it might hard to find out any more information
    about Victorian Stencil.  I like the name, it&#39;s very suitable so I&#39;d probably
    keep it.  So it might be a good idea to try to contact Jeff Levine and see if
    he&#39;d mind be digitazing the font, and see if he has any more information about
    the history of the typeface? <BR> <BR>Thanks again!'

  body: 'You look like you&#39;re having a good time with this project. Good for you.
    I thought you might like a little more background into Tuscan letterforms. Perhaps
    some of the following will spark ideas in the naming process. <BR> <BR>Keep in
    mind that &#34;Tuscan&#34; is not the nationality, but merely the style classification.
    Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean an Italian name wouldn&#39;t be appropriate.
    Tuscan was a Victorian lettering term used to describe an ornate style of capitals
    with bifurcated serif treatments. A slang term that was used for this kind of
    serif was &#34;fish-tail&#34; serif. <BR> <BR>Tuscan letterforms were immensely
    popular throughout the Victorian era and used on literally everything: trains,
    storefronts, book covers, you name it. It was a favorite for poster work of all
    kinds, especially circus and wanted posters. Due to its popularity and application
    in an era where hand-lettering was the standard, there were literally hundreds
    of personalized variations on the theme, and there were no bounds to their ornate
    treatment. <BR> <BR>The two 19th-century display types most associated with the
    Old West are the French Clarendon and the decorated Tuscans. Typographically,
    Tuscans became most popular in wood-type &#40;which were popular in frontier printing
    for many reasons&#41;. An interesting little side note to this: Many frontier
    printers, being artisans and craftsmen, would often take the larger wooden type
    characters from a Clarendon font and shape them with whittling knives, cutting
    notches and shaping corners to contrive new designs. <BR> <BR>Since it would have
    been very unlikely to see Tuscan face as a stencil, this aspect is more a stylistic
    treatment. So I think that Hrant&#39;s advice of finessing the &#34;cut gaps&#34;
    is excellent. I like the direction you&#39;re going with it so far. <BR> <BR>Since
    your counters are fairly open &#40;not always common in Tuscans&#41;, you might
    consider making the &#34;medial spurs&#34; bilateral throughout the alphabet.
    Doing so was the most common approach. Although handling the &#34;medial spurs&#34;
    as a unilateral design, or removing them altogether was also done. But as the
    designers of that time discovered, by doing the &#34;medial spurs&#34; bilaterally
    each character not only has a better symmetrical consistency, but they create
    an optical connectedness throughout a line of characters. <BR> <BR>Keep up the
    good work; and have fun! <BR> <BR>dm'
