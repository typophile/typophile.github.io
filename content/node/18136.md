  body: In the Dover book "Treasury of Authentic Art Nouveau Alphabets" (which is
    a partial reprint of a German type specimen book from 1903), there is a face called
    "Studley Extended" which, except for the proportions, looks almost exactly like
    your sample. It has many similar details, such as the hook serif on the G and
    the way the diagonal meets the right stem of the N just above the baseline. According
    to the Dover book, it was produced by the Inland Type Foundry, but I can't find
    any other references to it. I would have expected to see it in Mac McGrew's American
    Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, but maybe it was too old even for that.

  body: "Studley was named for [[Robert Studley|Robert P. Studley]], the first user
    of lithographic presses in Saint Louis. It was said to be only a modification
    of [[Woodward]]. Extended, Condensed, and Extra Condensed versions would follow
    within four years. While [[Inland Type Foundry|Inland]] claimed this was original
    work, [[Mac McGrew|McGrew]] claims that it was just a copy of Quentell/Taylor
    Gothic/Globe Gothic. McGrew in general shows little trust in Inland and denounces
    its claims of originality in many cases. Eckman showcases Inland's its aggressive
    salesmanship and bullying tactics.\r\n\r\n McGrew about Studley: [[Globe Gothic]]
    is a refinement of Taylor Gothic, designed about 1897 by [[ATF]] at the suggestion
    of Charles H. Taylor of the Boston Globe, and used extensively by that paper.
    But Taylor Gothic has mostly the same lowercase as [[Quentell]], though with hairlines
    heavied a bit. ATF's Central Type Foundry branch in St. Louis claims to have originated
    Quentell (q.v.) in 1895 or earlier. The conversion to Taylor Gothic was designed
    by [[Joseph W. Phinney]], while the redesign as Globe Gothic in about 1900 is
    credited to [[Morris Benton]]. It is a serifless, thick-and-thin face, distinguished
    by the high crossbar on E, F, and H. The angular end on the stems of V, W, and
    most lowercase letters. Globe Gothic Condensed, Extra Condensed, and Extended
    were designed by Benton about 1900. Globe Gothic Bold and its italic are also
    credited to Benton, in 1907 and 1908 respectively. But [[Frederic W. Goudy]],
    in the book on his typefaces, says, \"This type (Globe Gothic Bold), drawn at
    the suggestion of Joseph Phinney, followed in the main certain points which he
    wished brought out. It never had much vogue and is the least satisfactory (to
    me) of all my types.\" This is puzzling, as the bold departs somewhat from the
    style of the lighter weights, but is not at all characteristic of Goudy's work-nor
    of Benton's, for that matter. Studley of Inland Type Foundry was similar. Compare
    Ryerson Condensed, Radiant, Matthews, Pontiac, World Gothic.\r\n\r\n http[:]//cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/inland/"
