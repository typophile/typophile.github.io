body: "Hi, All\r\n\r\nI was recently working on a nastaleeq ligature font that has
  25000+ ligatures. Asiafont Studio opened the font all fine. But after generating
  font and opening back again showed a strange behaviour:\r\n\r\nOriginal, when first
  opened in AFS4:\r\nhttp://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u218/arifkarim/b211.gif\r\n\r\nGenerated
  output from AFS4:\r\nhttp://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u218/arifkarim/b212.gif\r\n\r\nU
  can clearly see that at a certain point, the glyphs looses their postscript names
  and start showing as \".notdefine\". I also tried generating as .otf. But this format
  is useless in MSvolt, regaring post script names isuue. \r\n\r\nStrange thing is
  that AsiaFont Studios own source file format \"*.vfb\" saves and opens error free.
  But problems accur everytime after generating ttf from it. I have even tried using
  TransType 3 to convert .vfb back to ttf but got same results as above. Btw, I am
  using windows vista home premium 32-bits.\r\n\r\nAny assitance would be appretiated...\r\n\r\nThnx\r\n"

  body: "It looks like a problem writing the post table of the generated font. I don't
    know whether there is something you can do in AFS to correct this, e.g. some kind
    of option setting. I used to have AFS, but have not used it for some years.\r\n\r\nAs
    a work-around, you could use a tool like TTX or OTMaster to build your own post
    table and add this to the generated font, replacing the incorrect AFS-written
    table."
