body: "im required on my 2nd yr graphic design course to produce a logo for myself,
  for my portfolio of work, not a great idea i dont think but im doing it anyway.\r\n\r\nI
  had some quick ideas today that id like to show, to see if anyway could point me
  in the right direction, theyre quite shabby and by no means finished at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nthe
  top one is supposed to be 'highlighted' as if i have highlighted the word in order
  to copy it. This idea stems from my work, in which  'appropriation' does feature,
  not plagiarism, obviously i wouldnt want to broadcast this, but i thought it oculd
  be a sort of 'in joke' , i htought it could dictate the type treatment of headings
  etc, possibly\r\n\r\nthe others are centered around the idea of 'roots'. Communicating
  strong foundations, growing talent, researching to the root of a theme etc........at
  the moment it looks like the roots have just been placed on, theyre only relatively
  quick versions, but maybe i need some idea of integrating the roots with my name...\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your help!\r\n\r\npete\r\n\r\nlink:\r\n\r\nhttp://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b265/jarvisjarvis/logologo.gif"

  body: I'm not convinced the roots approach adds to the design, but I do like the
    way it looks, and have the idea that you could adapt the lc "t" so that it flowed
    into a root system that spread underneath the type.

    its almost reminiscent of a tree..\r\n\r\n"

  body: Its not working for me at all...as it is now. You have to break away from
    the literal here and really think about what makes you different from the million
    other designers here. Growth, among other things, can be interesting but use it
    in a subtle way. Perhaps using a series, in which case you can have a kinetic
    identity.

  body: "yea i understand it might look a little too cliche maybe.......perhaps if
    the j desended into a root type thing, but less obvious\r\n\r\nwhatabout the top
    one? too simple? no character?"

  body: Aside from formal issues, the top one is dull. Okay so you took the box-tool
    in Illustrator and outlined your name. Again, it doesnt really say much about
    you.

  body: "The cut and paste idea could work if you highlighted part of the name, included
    a cursor and made use of the colour changes you sometimes get with software packages,
    in other words what you wanted to disguise, at the moment it looks a bit balanced
    on the J at the bottom of the box. As you note the roots are only sitting on the
    type, I think the root (sorry:) you should take is using the J and developing
    from there. In some ways combining the two might work with the box representing
    sky and breaking the J from the box to have roots stretching into the ground.
    Have a look at tightening your Pe and Ja kerning.\r\nTim"

  body: this has been curdling in my brain for the last day or two........maybe my
    name could be a stamp? because i use a lot of found material that i 'stamp' my
    mark on, i oculd show my name on a rubber stamp, or i could print the name with
    the effect of a rubber stamp....any ideas? sorry im not showin anything new

  body: "My first instinct would be to avoid that, it seems too much of a clich\xE9,
    it also would have to be very well executed, probably by having a rubber stamp
    made for you, to be convincing. Once your brain starts curdling, walk away and
    do something else, take the Bank Holiday from thinking about it and try another
    approach would be my advice.\r\nTim"

  body: "ok i this is the idea i had when i was in sainsburys. Because in my work
    i use a lot of existing themes, pictures and found material, and offer a different
    slant on them, i thought i could have a logo that has different perspectives.
    Maybe there will be 4 versions of the logo with different perspectives, though
    the white name will never move. so here it is, or the rough idea anyway:\r\n\r\nhttp://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b265/jarvisjarvis/perspectivelogo.gif\r\n\r\nits
    a mess at the moment however, the s is abismal, and i think i need a different
    sans serif, something a little bulkier maybe, any thoughts?"

  body: Try not to jump all over the place. Get a concept and work your way through
    it. That is a methodology of a true designer. I think the roots has possibilities...just
    not as it is now. I think your trying to say growth anyway so it would be more
    succefull as a kinetic identity rather than one image.

    I don't dislike the roots idea if it's that what you think best represents you,
    but maybe you should try to invert the process: instead of having roots coming
    out of the letters, try to have letters originating from roots...does it make
    any sense? \r\nI don't know about the first...from the academic point of view,
    your tutors may think you didn't try hard enough..."

    thing. I do feel now though that the root idea is a bit cliche, and more importantly
    im trying to produce a them that could continue into some interesting printed
    peice to display my portfolio.\r\nA the moment this is why i have continued with
    the 'me lookin at things in different perspectives' route.........developed more:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b265/jarvisjarvis/NEWEST.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b265/jarvisjarvis/outline.gif\r\n\r\nthe
    last ones are most recent.......so maybe the idea that the logo changes, to show
    different perspectives.....probably only using 1 part of my name, either pete
    or jarvis.....any thoughts?\r\n"

    think those commenting want to hear that you are on board with your own idea.\r\n\r\nI
    like the negative shape situation in this first new direction. Maybe your idea
    is that you don't have to be a growing tree or anything else for that matter."
