  body: 'That''s what I thought at first time but there are some little differences:
    (obviously) R''s leg, S and counters. Weight is also out (Medium and Bold are
    no good). So may be as Jan suggested, with some little adjustments and customization:
    starting from Medium weight, adding an outline stroke and reworking the R''s leg.'
