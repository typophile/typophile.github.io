  body: "Cross-referencing 1 and 4 implies that the translation of \"\u043C\u0430\u043A\u0435\u0442\"
    is \"layout\" because it applies to all stages, from empty to complete. The other
    words in 1 refer specifically to the sketched approximation of what a design may
    look like, which is most frequently called by the short form \"comp\". Your indd
    layout is a comp/mock-up if it's got dummy-text in it (Curious: is there a Russian
    counterpart to Lorem Ipsum?)\r\n\r\n2 is unclear to me, but when a layout is sent
    to the client for them to examine and identify anything that must be changed before
    it can be used as the final original, that is a \"proof\". Also, after the designer's
    work is done, the printing office will often send a printer's proof, to verify
    that they have printed it correctly before starting the whole print run.\r\n\r\n3
    is probably typesetting.\r\n\r\n4. The directly transliterated \"original\" is
    appropriate. It is called this because the copies will be made from it. It was
    \"paste-up\" in the days of drafting tables and line tape. Nowadays the meaning
    is clearest if you just call it the \"final PDF\"."

  body: "There aren't single words for most of those things. Most of the words you
    found are used, but have slightly different meanings depending on the context
    in which they're used and the preference of the person or business using them.
    In English these kinds of industry-specific terms that vary from place to place
    are generally referred to as <em>jargon</em>.\r\n\r\nIn general, I would call
    a hand-written sketch a <em>sketch</em>, a <em>rough</em> or a <em>rough sketch</em>.\r\n\r\nI've
    never heard a term for a partially finished InDesign file, and I would just call
    it, unimaginatively enough, a partially finished InDesign file. If it is a file
    with the basic page layout that serves as a starting point to build the pages
    of a magazine, newspaper or other publication, it would typically be called a
    <em>template</em>. A template might contain all the standard basics associated
    with that publication, like page numbers, sample headlines, sample table of contents,
    etc., that would then be modified by the layout artist/designer as needed.\r\n\r\nAt
    the newspaper where I worked as the design director, the processing of composing
    the finished text on pages was called <em>pagination</em>. This is not a universal
    term, however, and the process is referred to in different ways at different publications.
    I can think of no widely used term that means exactly that. Instead, the processes
    is a series of steps \u2014 each of which might have different terms in different
    places and contexts.\r\n\r\nA finished, high-resolution PDF that's been prepared
    for commercial printing is usually referred to as a <em>press-ready PDF</em>.\r\n\r\nAs
    I mentioned these terms are quite fluid in the sense that other terms are often
    used by other people in different situations.\r\n\r\nOf the online definitions
    you found, some of them mean very precise things  in specific situations. Several
    of the terms are outdated in the sense that they refer to processes and techniques
    that are no longer used. If you're interested, I'd be happy to give you an explanation
    for any of those terms and whether or not they're appropriate for what you have
    in mind."

    layouts go through several revisions you should use a version number. For example
    \"Layout-1\" (which you'd call Layout Version 1), then \"Layout-2\" and so forth.
    When it's been approved by the client \u2014 let's say version 3 \u2014 it becomes
    \"Layout-3-Final\" and \"Layout-3-Final.pdf\". Each designer has his own methods
    but I've generally seen it done this way."

    wow! I haven't knew about this too. I don't have InDesign right now, but I wonder,
    what about the hyphenization for this text? Sure, it's invented by InDesign team,
    and it hasn't long history like Lorem Ipsum text.\r\n\r\n@cerulean, @Thylacine,
    some words about <em>2</em> (partially finished layout). I meant there is the
    division of labour, and the work of the designer (art director) who did the template
    is called one way, and the work of the designer (typesetter?) who setting the
    pages (?) by this template called another way. But it would be one indesign file:
    Layout-1, Layout-2, Layout-3...\r\n\r\nSo, If I hear you alright, I can say:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>at
    first I make the <em>comp</em>, or the <em>template of layout</em>;</li>\r\n<li>then
    I make the <em>layout</em></li>\r\n<li>by <em>typesetting</em> and <em>paginating</em>
    the text;</li>\r\n<li>and finally it becomes the <em>print-ready PDF</em>, or
    just <em>original</em>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIs it right?\r\n\r\n@Thylacine, I would
    like to know about the verbs <em>to compose</em> and <em>to impose</em>. When
    do you use these words?\r\n\r\nAlso, I found the German translation of the verb
    \"\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044C\" (\"umbrechen\"), and I compared
    it with the English translation:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://nikve.ru/kartinki/umbrechen.png\">\r\n\r\nIs
    it the same as <em>to compose</em> and <em>to impose</em>?"

  body: "Some of these processes and work flows are new enough and vary enough from
    one place or business to another than no widely accepted words exist to describe
    them. There are also lots of terms that are left over from pre-digital publishing
    days that have been borrowed, but are no longer entirely accurate.\r\n\r\nA typical
    situation might be something like the following:\r\n\r\nA designer or art director
    does a series of <em>roughs</em>, which enables him to quickly explore a number
    of ideas. The designer might then develop <em>mockups</em> or <em>comps</em> of
    these ideas to show clients or employers. If the client or employer suggests changes,
    a set of <em>revisions</em> are made. If the client accepts the revisions, the
    project moves into actual <em>layout and production</em>, which varies greatly
    depending on the project and the established workflows at the agency or publishing
    house.\r\n\r\nAt a magazine, for example, an art director might oversee the design
    and production of the publication. This would involve a coordinated effort between
    the editors and the art director. The art director might develop a basic <em>layout</em>
    of the magazine based on the general style of the magazine and using the pre-prepared
    <em>templates</em>. Stories and advertisements would be flowed into position to
    see how everything fits.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the magazine moves into <em>production</em>
    where a <em>production or layout artist</em> puts it all together into what would,
    in pre-digital times, have been called a <em>mechanical</em> that consisted of
    <em>paste-up</em> on <em>mechanical boards</em> and cut film <em>overlays</em>.
    However, this has all been replaced by digital or <em>desktop publishing</em>
    where the entire process is done on computers.\r\n\r\nDepending on the situation
    a senior designer might design and <em>lay out</em> the more important pages while
    a <em>production artist</em> is tasked with making everything fit. The art director
    or a <em>senior designer</em> might personally design some of the more important
    <em>feature layouts</em> and the cover. Again, these more important pages might
    originate as rough sketches and proceed through the comp approval process before
    production begins.\r\n\r\nOnce the layout and production of the magazine is completed,
    it goes through a series of <em>proofs</em>, where it's meticulously reviewed
    by the editors, publisher and art director. When finished, a <em>press-ready PDF</em>
    might be made to send to the printer. The <em>prepress</em> department at the
    printer oversees whatever needs to be done to get the files to <em>RIP</em> (processed
    through the image or plate setting machine) where negatives or printing plates
    are produced. These prepress tasks might include fixing problems with the files,
    determining <em>imposition</em>, etc. Using this same RIP, the publisher will
    produce a <em>final proof</em>, which the client must sign before the job <em>goes
    to press</em>.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there are endless variations of this typical workflow
    that I've described. I've used a lot of the jargon that might commonly be used
    to describe these processes, so I hope that helps. A lot of the times, though,
    there isn't an exact or universally understood word, so the relevant step in the
    process is simply described in a sentence or two instead of being named."

    people working on it, as Thylacine mentioned. On smaller projects \u2014 such
    as a brochure \u2014 a designer or production artist might be chosen to put it
    together, under the direction of the person in charge.\r\n\r\n>  a press-ready
    PDF might be made to send to the printer\r\n\r\nOr you might send the printer
    the original InDesign file and graphics. This is my preference as it gives the
    pre-press department more options when preparing the file, especially if a last-minute
    change is needed. But if sending the InDesign file I always include a PDF too,
    for reference."

  body: "nikve wrote: <em>\"I would like to know about the verbs to compose and to
    impose.\"</em>\r\n\r\nI can see why you're confused by these two words. They have
    very different meanings and refer to completely different things.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    compose has many different meanings both in print production and in everyday life.
    In general, it means assembling something into an ideal configuration.\r\n\r\nIn
    print production, however, its something of an antiquated term describing a task
    that, for the most part, no longer exists. Composing referred to the task of assembling
    the metal type into words, sentences and entire pages.\r\n\r\nDepending on the
    technology involved, the compositor (the person assigned to with the task of composing)
    would have been the person working directly with individual metal letters or the
    person running the machines that composed the metal strips of type for the printing
    press. Of course this process has been replaced by more modern methods in commercial
    printing, so the term \"compose\" no longer has the specific meaning in printing
    that it once did. Today, it's word that might be best avoided in print production
    since its meaning is either obsolete or potentially confusing or confused with
    other processes.\r\n\r\nSecond, impose has a very different meaning. In printing
    imposing or imposition refers to the process by which pages are arranged on a
    sheet of paper that is about to be printed. When printing publications, the pages
    are never printed one at a time. Instead, multiple pages are printed on big sheets
    or webs of paper. These printed sheets of paper are then folded and trimmed. Imposition
    refers to the process of determining exactly how the pages need to be positioned
    and arranged on the sheets of paper to ensure that they will all be in the right
    order when the big sheet of paper is folded and trimmed to it's final size. A
    folded and trimmed sheet of paper made up of many different pages is called a
    signature. In a book, for example, signatures consisting of multiple pages are
    bound together to create the book. Imposition isn't something the designer or
    production artist needs to figure out. Instead it's handled by the printer. The
    designer does, however, need to be aware of the process and produce artwork that
    takes into consideration the number of pages in the signatures. In a magazine,
    for example, the total number of pages in the magazine ideally corresponds to
    the most efficient number of pages in each signature."

    and I'd strongly recommend taking a class if you can. And don't forget there's
    more than type. You need to learn how to set up pages, place photos, run type
    around photos, handle colors, and many other things.\r\n\r\n> paginating the text\r\n\r\nIf
    you're referring to putting the pages in the proper order for printing, a professional
    print shop will usually do that for you. It's part of the pre-press process as
    they prepare the file for printing. You'd prepare it as \"reader spreads\", which
    means it looks the way it'll look when printed and assembled. The printer will
    re-arrange the pages. (If you're using a print shop for the first time, ask to
    make sure they'll do this for you.)"

  body: "@Thylacine, thanks a lot for your detailed answers! that's just what I need.\r\n\r\n@JamesM,
    thank you! I have some experience with InDesign. In my speech I made such account
    to <em>paginating</em> because in Russian this word (\"\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044C\")
    means everything you do with your layout: typesetting, formatting, aligning and
    arranging text and pictures, etc. Not only dividing content into discrete pages.
    On the other hand we almost never use the verb <em>to typeset</em> (\"\u043D\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044C\").
    We don't have such professional occupation as a typesetter now (\"\u043D\u0430\u0431\u043E\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043A\").
    But we call a person who makes layout <em>a paginator</em> (\"\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043B\u044C\u0449\u0438\u043A\").
    Perhaps, this word is more closer to the word <em>composer</em>...\r\n\r\nNow
    these words and its meanings in Russian and English seem much clearer to me. Hope
    this thread will be helpful for some another translators!"
