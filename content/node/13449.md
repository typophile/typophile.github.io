  is the image.</a>\r\n\r\nI was walking through Target and saw this yesterday. I
  recognized the type on the jacket, and thought I was seeing Carter's Mantinia, but
  when I cracked open the cover to see the title page, the display and text face looked
  very similar and played very well with it. I was curious if anyone could confirm
  Mantinia or if someone who has picked it up could confirm the text face. (As Mantinia
  is impossible.)\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: " Check out the B's in Galliard and Mantinia. The B on the book cover, the
    cross bar where the 2 bowls of the b meet. Galliards closes both bowls, Mantinia
    leaves the bowls connected and open.\r\n\r\nAlso check out the 'foot' of the R's.
    Galliards is rather plain, whilst Mantinia's has a rather pronounced brush flair.\r\n\r\nI
    vote Mantinia."

  body: The cover is definitely Mantinia -- I was taking a guess at the text face.
    Galliard plays very well with Mantinia. ;)

  body: Yes, agreed. I wish I had scans. I'll get them up if I can pick up the book
    sometime soon.

  body: I was in Borders yesterday and took a look at this book. The text font appears
    to be John Hudson's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/manticore/">Manticore</a>,
    but there was no colophon to be sure.
