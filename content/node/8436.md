body: 'hola typophiles, <BR> <BR>this is from an old LP from 1969. Identifont brought
  me pretty close to a match but not quite. Compacta was the closest but it&#39;s
  definitely disqualified by the parentheses. any help would be greatly appreciated.

  body: Haettenschweiler is close in several ways but not quite. the parentheses and
    question mark are too squared in shape. the sample is much more rounded. <BR>

  body: also close but &#40;sadly&#41; no cigar. the little foot on the cap-G doesn&#39;t
    taper, the parentheses aren&#39;t round enough and Helv Inserat&#39;s x-height
    is pretty high but not high enough. <BR>thanks for your help. <BR> <BR>-d

  body: Derek, if you do care, that&#39;s enough, that&#39;s what I use to say when
    somebody says something like... who cares, nobody is going to tell that,.. I do
    and that&#39;s it. If you do care more for every &#34;little&#34; detail of your
    work, the sum of them has to be for good &#40;hope I explained it right ... english...&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Hasta luego y muchas de nadas Se

  body: i know! the details are everything. hidden as well as visible. like when a
    craftsman finishes the back side of a piece of furniture. eventually they will
    be noticed. i couldn&#39;t live with myself using the wrong typeface. i felt like
    a liar. <BR> <BR>thanks again, <BR>derek
