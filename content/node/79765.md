body: "   Hello,  These are two logo options shown on a rough mock up of the Uride
  homepage and header space available.  The intended message is  U (you) ride.       I'm
  not a graphic designer so these are only conceptual.  \r\n\r\n Uride.ca is a carpool/rideshare
  site across canada. Carpoolers primarily fall into the 25-40 age group and will
  use the site for school, public, and work commutes.  A green approach to helping
  the planet.  \r\n\r\n Please let us know which logo you would choose. \r\n\r\n We
  are looking for the most brandable, marketable, printable logo.\r\n\r\n Thank you
  for taking the time.  "

  body: Sorry, but it's neither. Also the name is bothering me a bit, it is just one
    letter away from <em>urine</em>. Perhaps consider adding a dash after u?

- body: "I agree with apankrat. Not to be too harsh...but both versions look amateur,
    poorly researched, and overall just unprofessional. Sorry! \r\n\r\nGiven your
    username matches the logo and website, am I right to assume you're not a professional
    graphic designer? Did you design this logo yourself? "

    with u-turn is positive."
