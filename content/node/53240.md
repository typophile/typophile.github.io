  body: Are you sure that isn't calligraphy? Most of the repeating letters are quite
    different from each other, with the exception of a lowercase <strong>e</strong>
    in the first line and one in the last line (the first <strong>e</strong> in Catherine
    and the <strong>e</strong> in Whittier).
