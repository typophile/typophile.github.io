  (http://typophile.com/node/12689), I understand this place is packed with people
  sitting on a lot of knowledge. Would therefor like to see if there are any interesting
  answers to this question:\r\n\r\nI am looking for examples/books/website/opinions
  etc on ways of using typography and written language in ways that have more of a
  \"sub\"cultural aspect to it. What I mean is groups of people, changing the way
  their (written) language is communicated, to state a belonging to a group or such.
  An example of this is \"Leet Speak\"* , used by computer gamers/hackers/etc. New
  ways of adding values to the written language, based on for example technical limitations.\r\nThere
  are more examples on this from the computer era (the smileys could be considered
  one), but I havn't yet come across any from the pre-computer age so that is what
  I am especiallt interested in.\r\n\r\nI am also looking for ways of using existing
  typography in other visual ways, such as ASCII-art*, art done with typewriters,
  ANSI-art* etc etc. If you have other examples for this I'd love to know more about
  them.\r\n\r\n* More on...\r\nLeet:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet\r\n\r\nAn
  experiment with Leet and Caslon I did a while ago:\r\nhttp://burnfield.com/peter/work/caslon-leet\r\n\r\nASCII-art:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii_art\r\n\r\nANSI-art:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter

    sub-culture typographic expressiveness....Marinetti, Apollinaire, etc. Johanna
    Drucker's book \"The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923\"
    (University of Chicago Press, 1994) goes into great detail about their work...the
    punk fanzine aesthetic of the late 70s - early 90s established its own visual
    language (via typographic expressiveness) as a way of sub-culture identification...\r\n\r\nHave
    you checked out Saki Mafundikwa's book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0972424067/ref%3Dpd%5Fsl%5Faw%5Falx-jeb-9-1%5Fbook%5F5094816%5F3/002-3013161-5862407\">Afrikan
    Alphabets</a>? He covers the writing systems of several African language, many
    of which were established during and post-colonial rule as a way of establishing
    and maintaining cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThis is <a href=\"http://www.typetalkfonts.com/frame_orthography.html\">a
    paper</a> I wrote in grad school this year about non-standard orthography and
    non-standard dialects that you might find interesting...i cited Haitian Kreyol
    and Rastafarian Jamaican as examples where nonstandard orthography is used to
    express national/ social identity.\r\n\r\nSounds like a good topic, good luck!\r\n\r\namy"
