body: A user named Kellis was trying to find the name of this font, it was posted
  about a month ago but the thread has since been closed with no luck.  In my travels
  I stumbled across the answer, a font by &#34;Levi&#34; called <a href="http://www.acidfonts.com/bfonts7.htm"
  target="_blank">Bitsumishi</a>.  Hope he/she is still checking back about it! <BR>
