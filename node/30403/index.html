  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi all,</p>
<p>i am interested in embossing type on a book jacket for a <em>very</em> small (short-run) personal project. i am only interested in blind embossing, not foil embossing.</p>
<p>i have a feeling it would be quite expensive to have a printer do this. are there cost effective alternatives to a traditional printer&rsquo;s embossing process? is it possible to do it myself?</p>
<p>thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Blind embossing is the cheapest embossing one can buy. Sometimes printers forget that they are not using any ink for it &ndash; and try to charge the same price as if they were. (This was what I learned from a first hand experience in stationery and engraving back in 1971) &ndash; so my only suggestion is when negotiating your price - remind them - no drying overnight - no ink to be used, etc. etc. What will cost is the die they must cut to emboss. But the last blind emboss we did &ndash; they actually used a paper plate for a short run - and it was very inexpensive.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>A very competent embosser, foil stamper, is Letterpress Unlimited in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This is not cheap, and no, you cannot do it yourself. Note there is a difference between embossing (two plates and register) and debossing (one plate).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You might, if you have a very short run and time to spend, try a method I have used for creating visuals to show clients (not that I invented it, a colleague who is a paper engineer showed it to me). Cut the characters out of a thick (2mm) sheet of plastic card and mount it to another heavier sheet (or plywood) sticking laser prints on both, before cutting, can help to make sure everything is precisely as you want it, lightly wet (wetting helps stretch and separate the paper fibres) an untrimmed sheet of the stock and securely tape it to the mounting board, and use a burnishing tool to gently work the stock around the relief, leave it to dry on the board, roughly trim it and make up your book and do a final trim. It is very time-consuming and it is worth trying different stocks, as some will be better than others (a more fibrous, uncoated paper works best) and doesn&rsquo;t create as good a finish as a proper emboss.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I was thinking along the same lines as Tim, and also wondering how expensive it would be for you to have a polymer letterpress plate made. Probably cheaper than a standard die, and since you have so few to do, it should hold up all right. If there are only a few characters, hand-cutting would make sense, but if the type is smallish, and lots of characters, then polymer might be the way to go. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll remember this, but if you order a plate just be sure to specify which way letters read depending on whether you intend to emboss or deboss.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>wow, thanks for all of your responses. i&rsquo;ll start looking into all of your suggestions.</p>
<p>i had a couple specific further questions:
*Jackie, when you say they used a &ldquo;paper plate,&rdquo; do you mean instead of a metal die?
*Bruce, is a &ldquo;polymer letterpress plate&rdquo; a standard animal, so to speak? Are you suggesting this would be a more inexpensive method to use working with a printer, or as a way to make my own die/plate and use Tim&rsquo;s process?
*finally - i found embossing powder last night. insofar as i don&rsquo;t actually want to print the type, i&rsquo;m not sure this is a viable alternative, but was curious if anyone had any experience with it nonetheless.</p>
<p>thanks again,
jarrod</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can do as Tim suggest - IF it' s only for a short run that is.
I have been doing lots of linocuts and tried it for embossing as well.
The material is very easy to cut, so it can be done pretty fast and accurate.
Even using a spoon to rub the paper can create some nice result, so you won' t have to invest in a press&hellip;
Best to use some quality art paper;
If you do have a press, put some cloth on the paper - as with etching.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jarrod, talk to anybody local that does letterpress and they&rsquo;ll be able to tell you of a local source. Basically you give them a PDF or a Postscript file and they give you back the beast in relief on a sheet of etched polymer. A local might even have a spoiled plate with type of approximately the same size as yours so you could try an experiment before investing in a whole new plate. These plates do not have a terribly deep profile so it may not suit your needs, hence trials always helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where Findlay is in relation to you, but if you don&rsquo;t have a local friend who does letterpress, there is a monthly letterpress enthusiasts newspaper, <em>The Printer,</em> right there in Ohio. Their address is 337 Wilson Street, Findlay, OH 45840; their phone is 419-422-4958; their email, <a href="mailto:theprinter4918@hotmail.com">theprinter4918@hotmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>A paper plate is made from fiber - it&rsquo;s a fiberboard. It is used in printing for very short runs. With many impressions - it becomes worn out - so it isn&rsquo;t good for large jobs.</p>
