body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know how to order LetterHead fonts from outside the
  USA?\r\n\r\nTheir order form correctly recognized I am writing from Germany (either
  from my IP or from my email address) but then insisted I check the box for the \"state\"
  I live in - offering a choice between US states, the UK and the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nI
  used their contact form for help, but no answer so far. This leads me to believe
  that there must be a compatibility problem. I am using Firefox on a Power Mac with
  Tiger.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can give me some advice how to contact them by other means
  - there is no phone number on their site.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKatharina"

    get back to you. (If he hasn't already.)

    to manually type in the tiny province I live in - must be tiny compared to any
    US state - and it worked! I am now the proud owner of seven new fonts!"

    with an area of 70,553 km\xB2 (27,241 square miles) and almost 12.5 million inhabitants,
    lies in the southeast of Germany and is the geographically largest state (Bundesland)
    of Germany. Its capital is Munich.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn area, you're a little bigger
    than West Virginia, and a little smaller than South Carolina. That makes you bigger
    than most of the New England sates, including Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe 2000 (year)
    National Geographic Road Atlas lists the population of Pennsylvania as 12,001,451,
    so you're a little bigger. Pennsylvania is the sixth largest state in the U.S.\r\n\r\nIn
    short, your size is pretty significant! "
