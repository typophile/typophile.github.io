  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is a feat that aludes me. I&rsquo;ve never had a &ldquo;True Eye&rdquo; for choosing color or creating applicable color combinations that seem to add to the work than deter from it. I understand the fundamentals of color and have a decent understanding of color theory, but still I come up very short when making qualified color choices. So, I started searching for something to make the process alittle easier.</p>
<p>I came across this nice little application: <a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/"><a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/">http://www.colorschemer.com/</a></a> Color Schemer Studio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice advanced color wheel and combination developer, plus the website has a user added gallery of color combinations they&rsquo;ve used that work well.</p>
<p>The only thing is, it&rsquo;s RGB/HEX based only. I don&rsquo;t do very much in the way of web/screen design as much as I do Print. I was wondering if any of you fellows have come across anything CMYK based be it a book, or a program or even a color blog.</p>
<p>I believe if I can bring my abilities in color up a notch or two, it would be the difference between being an able designer and an excellent designer.</p>

<p>I think that working effectively in color is all about knowing your media&rsquo;s potential range.  There are huge differences in color gamut (range) you get when you go from paint, to ink, to computer screen, to film is important. It isn&rsquo;t just about managing color transitions across these media but knowing what color strengths &amp; deficits a given media inherently has and exploiting these to good effect. This is perhaps more true in print than anywhere else which is why those pantone books &amp; CMYK chart books are so useful. Do you already have those? Of course these and Color wigets can overwhelm as easily as they can help - especially if you don&rsquo;t have some initial idea of what your looking for or matching to.</p>
<p>I also think that color&rsquo;s relationship to emotion &amp; culture is never going to go away or be managed by hints or web-wigets.</p>
<p>I think this last aspect is the most important, but it is only going to come from personal feeling, experience &amp; insight. Color is personal, regional, and is age related. And then there is fashion. All in all it&rsquo;s tough to grasp color. Thats why I think a personal sense of color is what is required. Then you can check your choices against the context of the client, target audience, culture, media/technology etc.</p>
<p>I like your idea for a color blog!</p>
<p>What kinds of things do you design in print? Can you show us examples of work you felt succeeded using color &amp; work that fell short?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A tool for CMYK similar to the one on the website mentioned would have to be a book, not a program, simply because you&rsquo;re not going to get anything approaching true CMYK (subtractive) color from RGB (additive) color rendering. While RGB colors are rendered by mixing light in a black box (almost infinitely variable and thermodynamically reversible), CMYK colors are produced by mixing inks and applying them to white paper (also quite variable, but thermodynamically irreversible).</p>
<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t preclude using an RGB tool to come up with pleasing color combinations: the trick comes in finding CMYK formulas (in, say, the Pantone Process Color Guide) which match the colors you choose. However, be aware that process color is notoriously ineffective at reproducing clean greens and oranges (which is why they developed the Hexachrome system). Still, with a lot of practice and with the right lighting setup, you could probably get pretty proficient at coming up with printable equivalents.</p>

<p><a href="http://colourlovers.com">http://colourlovers.com</a></p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m verging on phobic as far as colour is concerned; I&rsquo;m red/green colourblind (to a degree, it&rsquo;s not terrible and rarely causes me a problem), but it&rsquo;s always good to bounce the idea of what colour you&rsquo;d like to use off someone you trust.</p>
