  body: Mallard Signs offers all types of signs. I am choosing with this logo to not
    reflect the subject matter because I think &#34;signs&#34; says it all. Most sign
    companies in town all offer the same services. There isn&#39;t &#40;from my knowledge&#41;
    a sign company that just sells roadside signs, then a company that just sells
    yard signs. <BR> <BR>Plus, there will be decriptive copy describing the types
    of services offered that go with the logo.

    wings, <i>smaller</i> head. <BR> <BR>As for placement, I see the &#34;ll&#34;
    as a perch. You should decide whether it&#39;s landing or taking off, and nudge
    to the left or right accordingly. The latter is the more consistent with the ommission
    of visible feet, and I doubt you would want to add feet. The new head looks more
    like landing, and the first head looks more like taking off. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    great type and colors.

    dynamic in your revision process. I didn&#39;t comment when I first saw your design,
    because nothing immediately stood out for critique and I&#39;m too lazy to just
    type &#34;well done&#34;. Anyway, it seems at this point that one of the biggest
    issues with the design is the proportions of the duck. Interestingly, if you return
    to your initial post, the proportions are pretty accurate, while in your last
    post your proportions have created a baby duck &#40;small underdeveloped wings
    and an oversized head&#41;. Also, although the smoother head is more beautiful,
    it reminds me more of a swan direction than the original mallard head. The first
    head seems to represent a more agressive, dynamic and proactive business &#40;in
    flight&#41;. I will say, however, that your second approach to the tail is an
    improvement. I am glad that nobody has suggested a type alternative, because that&#39;s

    <BR>Reducing the duck 5% and moving ot up more helped. <BR> <BR>As far as the
    gesture of the duck, there are pics that have similar poses to mine. My interpretation
    of the duck comes from a combination of images that I studied before I began the
    project.  <BR> <BR>However, I know it isn&#39;t realistic, but I didn&#39;t want
    it to be. I didn&#39;t want the gesture to be too bold. I wanted to make it simplistic
    and soft. I have seen some really good duck logos that are bold and more gestural
    that look more like the pics provided above. I just wanted to go in a different
    direction. <BR> <BR>In relation to keeping the duck apart from the type, the client
    wants the logo to be able to work with the type. On the signage they will have
    to be used closely together. I really feel the changes above solves the issue
    of the icon working-with-the-type. I think the duck was just too close to the
    el&#39;s. <BR>
