   Yes, if you could scan the page(s) from the Imprimerie specimen book, that would be great. I'm working from the 16pt from the "Debuts de L'Imprimerie en France" book mentioned above (have no idea how I mistranscribed it as "Origines"). It has a fairly complete set of sorts, but is missing miniscule w and magiscule X (or, possibly, I overlooked their occurrences).

   And thanks for pointing me to the IN specimen book; I wasn't aware of it. It's high on my want list now.

   Also, if people are <i>really</i> curious to see my work-in-progress, ask and I'll post. I'm kinda excited about this one.</div>

<i>So you’re doing a literal revival? Like you’re not going to improve that “g”?</i>

What I've drawn so far is quite literal, but I do plan on improving some of the glyphs. The cap "T", for example, reads too much like an "E". I'm not yet convinced I need to redo the "g", though. It's perfectly legible, and is a very distinctive feature of the font. It's also historically grounded, having the same shape as in Collard Mansion's 1484 Ovid Metamorphoses (arguably a more direct influence on this font than Gutenberg; in particular, the final letter variations are almost a direct match).

1) I don't think there's a reliable way anyway. The talus (internal leading) can be anything, even negative, like if there's kerns at the bottom of the descenders of a script face - and it doesn't even have to be a script face: I remember seeing smaller sizes of some Baskerville with a "g" that extended below the Em! (Or maybe it was Palatino.)
2) Don't forget to account for Didot versus Postscript points.

> What would you suggest bastardizing it to?

I'd just make the top of the "g" more integral, not so slapped on. But only if it's not a literal revival... in which case I might not stop at the "g".

The way it is here, the designer probably figured he had a good balance of disparate elements ("goth remix", as Hrant put it), so normalizing problem characters kind of defeats the whole purpose of the font.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: can I quote you in the marketing materials for the font? More seriously, I'm digitizing this because I think it makes an interesting statement, and given the resurgence in blackletter faces, I think it may well find niches in certain designs. I find it more readable than most blackletters, good enough for medium-length runs of text.

hrant (re size): yes, the talus of this font is especially confusing because the cap "V" has an ascender that vastly exceeds the normal ascent, so much so that it could almost collide with the previous line's descender. Indeed, in one of the larger sizes (I think 16/18 but haven't measured it carefully) you get the feeling that the compositor adjusted the line breaks to avoid just such a collision.

andigrl: actually, in the clip I posted, all the "s" glyphs happen to be final, so you're seeing only that form of teh letter. The other form is far more standard. I'll post three images of it here for your your amusement.

First, a <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/xgothic/s_raw.png">raw scan</a> (normalized for contrast) of one instance. This is a 2400 dpi scan, so it's about 467 ppem. The printing quality is fairly good for 100-year old letterpress, but of course you can see plenty of paper texture and a bit of uneven ink spread.

Second, I <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/xgothic/s_avg.png">averaged</a> together dozens of instances to form a composite image. I believe this image reveals very nearly the true shape of the metal. You can see a slight lightening of the interior of the letter on corners, indicating that some instances are chipped. This lightening always happens on fragile parts of letters, and the degree of lightening corresponds to the probability of damage. Similarly, the zone of ink spread is a light-gray blur emanating from the body of the letter.

Last, my <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/xgothic/s_font.png">digitization</a>. You can see that I followed the original shape quite literally, even to the point of different rounding radii for the different corners. I may want to replace some of these rounded corners with sharp ones, but I also don't want to change the character of the font too much. In particular, at large sizes I find a mixture of soft and sharp corners to be unappealing.

That's like averaging all the portrait shots in a photo shoot and saying that the composite best captures the subject. An interesting modern art idea, intellectually intriguing but dull in practice. There are always one or two shots that stand out, capturing the presence of the subject, far more attractive than the others, or a composite of them can ever be. 

It's also like digitally remastering an old music recording by averaging transcriptions from vinyl. It would be better to work from the original masters, or snip the hiss and clicks. You can keep them as a featured artefact (Portishead, Founders Caslon), but averaging them just creates soft noise. 

With letterpress typography neither the type ("the true[?] shape of the metal") nor an average of impressions reveals the nature of the endeavor: there is an optimum printing. The question is, what is it? That's open to critical interpretation (how much bite, how much ink, etc.) What was the type founder's intent? What did he consider the best impression? Was there something that he was aiming for with the typeface that he was never able to achieve in letterpress, that may be possible digitally? I suspect he would have opted for more sharpness, rather than less.

Repurposing a typeface by digitizing invlolves a critical attitude, a value judgement. The "averaging" method is one such judgement as to what is appropriate, but it is non-commital, a statement too fuzzy to be disproved. Not the same as the truth.

Ultimately there is no truth, only design.</div>

No, because a metal sort is not a person.

If the point is to make a literal revival, and when you don't have access to the original metal (plus access to a way to actually print with it in an "intended" way) Raph's method is supremely useful*, sort of because it removes printing variance. This, even (in fact especially) if the printing at hand was done in a way that the original designer didn't want (not that all of them were sophisticated enough to worry about that) because the "average" form is still something more than nothing that you can work from, to interpret further.

* It won't be long before it gets a lot more attention. Raph, send it to APHA for one.

		<div class="commentbody">Whether it's a good idea to average an image seems like a really pleasantly complicated question. On the one hand you could be seeking an average because you want to find out what it is - just curious - or because you think that it is meaningful on an artistic level in an of itself. Maybe valid... Maybe.

You also might want to use it as Hrant said, as the base to jump off from. That seems fairly viable to me. But my intuition is that if you are not careful a blurry image may lead to soft blurry thinking. Not that it has to be that way - but the averaging could be a way of letting a process be a substitute for looking & thinking. A dubious & weak substitute. It might well be a good tool - I can't say - I haven't tried it. But it does seem like it could be a kind of crutch you don't need getting in the way of the real job at hand.

I think that is probably why Nick was suggesting that a new remix might be a better route. Making your own would require a more direct & less automatic relationship with the shapes.

Being really litteral in your revival might be best served by picking an specific imprint to use & improve from ( plus some altrenates to think about ) gives you a more specific outline to develop reactions to - more specific aspects, more personality or character to like or dislike - and to make conscious decisions about.

And picking a specific instance ( or several one at a time ) also brings you face to face with the issue of ink/imprint/paper VS screen raster & laserprinting & other modern printing/output. There have been many Threads here on Typophile that talk about the relationship. The book ' Counterpunch : making type in the sixteenth century, designing typefaces now ' by Fred Smeijers has a great section in which talks about the way that laserprinters and other modern printing differ from metal print and what he regards as the mistakes that were made when classic faces were digitized. If you are making a revival it seems like this issue aught maybe; to be issue #1. Do you aready know about these issues? Am I preaching to the choir?

Hrant, What is APHA? 

I hope your project goes well. This face has a ton of personality & verve. I think thats why I worry about averaging. It think that verve might be lost in the process.

 "How  many  times  have  APHA  members  compared  two  typefaces, thought them similar (if not identical), and  felt at a loss to prove it? Such a problem was faced by  Kay Amert, Professor and Director of the Typography  Laboratory at the University of Iowa, when she examined  the types used by two French printers: Simon de Colines  and Robert Estienne. She perceived an eerie likeness  when before her lay two books: the former’s La Dissection  and the latter’s Georgics-like poem La Coltivatione. A bit  of a mystic, she cracked the problem in a dream in which  the gestalt of a single letter floated before her computer  screen; and, lo, superimposition became the answer. By  bit-mapping a particular letter from one page in vertical  lines and its equivalent from the other in horizontals,  she saw consonance where they created a cross-hatch  and  differences  where  single  lines  extended  beyond  the cross-hatchings. When she presented still another  comparison, some grew impatient to learn her views as  to why there should be such differences: punch modifications? re-cuttings? variations in inking? make-ready?  paper-dampening? But Professor Amert held that such  questions called for other seminars and that her purpose  was to recommend – to serious type-history scholars –  the computer as an aid in addressing problems which  have plagued them for centuries.  - - Greer Allen"

That thing - no? What do you think make's ralph's analysis better? The part about the 'broken/weaker' bits?

Anyway - I have noticed that there is always a groupo of folk who hold that systems & analysis don't help the design of letterforms much or at all; and those that think they can be of service. Hrant, I think you Ralph & I belong in the second group as I see it. But I have to admit that even as I seek out systems ( Like DeGroots' letterform weight model) I remain slightly skeptical of them too and I think that's prudent even healthy - don't you?

2. But that L is almost a [[Civilité]]

3. The type seems to have no real rhythm of shapes or internal elements, the way that most "blackletters" do…

The art nouveau era was symbolized by a number of attempt to reform blackletter by mixing it with itself or with foreign styles. To my knowledge, none of the attempts "worked"* 

Raph's find doesn't either, but it could always revived it anyway. (I don't know what a user could use it for… the typeface didn't successfully capture any contextual spirit in its own time, either.)

Call me a [[designer]], but I think that the exact (or as close to exact as possible) recreation of someone else's intent is totally boring. Put those outlines where YOU think they should go. It isn't really important where the typefounder put them, I think. This face is not that "good" anyway. If you approach it more from a "designists" point of you, you might actually improve upon the past, rather than just recreate it.**  

* After the second world war, some designers—mostly in Germany—had figured out a way to make blackletter work again, and it was not any of the art nouveau methods. Their method was The Pen. Of course many art nouveau forms were formed by the pen, too, but not with "consistency." Those 1920s faces were more legible, even if Hrant doesn't like pen-based forms. 

**Not everything that existed in the past deserves to be revived, just because it happened to have been created once. In the end, you seem to be reviving this because you like it. But if people had "liked" this face, then it would already be with us in digital form. Show all of those nay-sayers what they were missing by finally making this design work! Its old forms will mostly likely make people think, "you know, maybe there was a reason that this had gone so long without having been revived…"

That's why I said "like", and also mentioned another analogy, old recordings.
No analogy is exact, or else it wouldn't be an analogy.

The analogy is valid: there is a variance of instances in a photo portrait session, just as there is a variance in letterpress type impressions of the same character in a sort. The point is that in a session of "shots" or "instances" where the image is variable, there is always going to be an image capture that is truer than others, and hence also truer than an average. That's the way people see things.

It is not a scientific truth, but a subjective truth: the discriminating eye of an art director chooses the "selects" for a magazine, and the discriminating eye of the type designer should likewise make its decision. That is the responsibility of design. Averaging is a cop-out.

Having said that, I do find certain kinds of averaging fascinating, but in those cases there is some edge to the procedure, for instance the musical work of Brian Whitman, where he mines massive databases. The equivalent in typography would be a blackletter mix-font that averages every font keyworded "blackletter" at Myfonts.</div>

Because a human face is a dynamic, organic, <strong>living</strong> thing.
A metal sort however is a static thing, consicously designed. It's a lifeless lump.

No, in this case averaging is a tool, a useful one, because it shows you what some other designer did, in a way otherwise inaccessible. Other designers had a brain too. But, again, this is only if you're doing a literal revival. Which makes me ask: why don't you go ahead and state a broader belief of yours: that <strong>revivalism</strong> is a cop-out?

But the process of letterpress printing introduces all kinds of unpredictable effects, due to things like varying wear of different pieces of type which represent the same letter, variance of inking, variance of pressure, and variance of paper stock. So how is one to know which is the "true" impression, any more than one is to know which photo captures the "true" personality of the sitter?

>No, in this case averaging is a tool, a useful one,

I agree, it can be useful, but it has to be a starting point, or a stepping stone, not the destination (or almost-destination)

>why don’t you go ahead and state a broader belief of yours: that revivalism is a cop-out?

That's not my belief. My belief is, and has always been, that revivals have their place in contemporary typography. I have done many revivals, and am working on one at the moment, actually. 

What I have argued against is the suffocating dominance of revivals and old typefaces in our type culture.

Generative art that uses algorithms to mine databases is a more recent idea, derived from Google, perhaps, which coincided with the millennium.

A similar "algorithmically driven" openness to unpredictability of form is present in LettError's work, e.g. Beowolf and the Twin typeface.

Obviously no photo can ever capture anybody's personality. But the shape of a piece of metal is on a qualitatively different different plane of definition. That's why the analogy is more confusing than insightful.

If you're talking about commissions, that's entirely different. Being paid to explicitly do something is partly excusable (if still somewhat of a cop-out; but we're all human). However, free-wheelingly contributing to the "suffocating dominance" is a <strong>major</strong> cop-out, no?

Also, I wonder, what do you think about type designers whose oeuvre is 90% revivals?

Maybe your thoughts on revivalism have indeed not changed since the Paleozoic; but if not, then your vitriol against revivalism has certainly subsided, just in the past half a decade or so! Wow. But why?

		<div class="commentbody">Antiphrasis: it's certainly possible to do it in Photoshop (I used Gimp myself), but tedious to the extreme in quantity. Thus, I hacked up some code to segment, classify, and blend automatically. The particular run that resulted in this "s" image was taken from a half dozen pages, contained about 10,000 total glyph impressions, and took several hours of computer time to crank through. If motivated, I could probably make the tools an order of magnitude or two faster, but even so it's a huge improvement over doing it all by hand.

Nick said, <em>there is a variance in letterpress type impressions of the same character in a sort.</em>. Yes, and that is simply not the case with standard digital type. (you could have a font with lots of alternates, perhaps even randomly selected, to simulate the flavor of letterpress, but that would be a whole other ball of wax).

Hrant and I had some email exchanges about Baskerville* specimens a few months back, and I pointed out an "a" impression that looked quite garaldish (garaldean?). If I were doing a Baskerville revival, it would be tempting to use this particular impression as a model. However, it would be a lot harder to argue that this form should be considered historically significant. I do think that the averaging technique, could help unlock some of the secrets hidden in these seminal sources.

*I had the pleasure of leafing through a Baskerville Aesop today, at Serendipity Books in Berkeley. Only $475 too!

I had said <em>the true shape of the metal</em>, but want to take that back. The shape of the metal is but one truth, and arguably not the one closest to the intent of the type designer or printer. Metal type is designed for an environment in which there is always gain on the press; the fact that better quality presswork often meant less gain does not mean that the designer's intent would have been satisfied by a perfectly sharp and gainless reproduction of the metal shapes.

What I would like to claim, instead, is that this averaging procedure produces an image that is very nearly as <em>clear</em> as a high-res capture of the shape of the metal. A straight-up average is going to be a bit blurred, largely because it's impossible to totally get rid of misregistration errors. But, that said, the very low noise of the result image lends itself well to sharpening (or, for an extremely sophisticated practitioner, deconvolution). I'm playing with this now, and the <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/xgothic/s_sharp.png">initial results</a> are fascinating indeed. You can actually see the body of the metal being surrounded by the ink gain.

So yes, I would stand behind the claim that this averaging technique is an <em>analytical</em> tool of unsurpassed power. Further, that these images are arguably better than either going to the metal or choosing individual impressions if one's goal is creating a faithful reproduction. Whether there's any artistic or design merit in doing so is another question altogether, and I'm heartened to see the debate over it.

My politics:
Think globally, act locally -- that means local culture providing meaningful, profitable work for people everywhere, work which expresses the diversity of culture, engaged with today's issues. Typographic culture falls far short of that: the typefaces most people in the West use were designed long ago and/or far away, provided by trans-national corporations. There is a role for continuity with the past, but it's overdone.
I hope that's not vitriolic.

>what do you think about type designers whose oeuvre is 90% revivals?

I'm not into finger-pointing at individuals, only at TNCs, which are like public institutions. 
I've argued, on other Typophile threads, that revival is not type design, because it's taking credit for someone else's work. But it's not a black and white issue, there are many shades of originality.  

I don't think I've eased up on my cause, after all I'm onto Raph's case here. But I have nothing against the guy, it's just a philosophical discussion. He made certain statements about "truth" which I contested, hence the debate -- no vitriol.

This approach: scientific analysis accurate, art marginalized as a gloss.

It's not possible to separate the art and technology so neatly. The question of what is faithful is a question of design belief. 
For instance, there is a quality of sharpness which would be apparent in an individual impression, which the average is not faithful to. 
The scientific assumption is that what can be accomplished with a bit of technology is better than what can't.

I said unpredictable, not random. A database that constantly changes from day to day is unpredictable, because one cannot predict the future. The appearance of the Twin font, driven by the weather in Minneapolis, is something that von Neumann would have approved as being truly random.</div>

This approach: art (expressing myself) is what counts,  scientific analysis (or just plain thought, really) an impediment. That's not Design. Fear of analysis, minimization of technique, these things prevent progress. In a way, shunning analysis is a form of revival, that of ideas, approaches! <strong>That</strong> is most certainly not type design. This field is littered with people who really don't have the intellectual stamina and curiosity to exceed the styles -but also ideas- of the past.

I don't think you understand what Raph is doing.
Averaging isn't necessarily blurry.

Are you perhaps simply seeing in this the things you need to reject it/analysis?

That's not what I had in mind. I'm talking about what I do, which is commercial type design, where the art and design involved are hand-eye-mind skills. This is what I'm opposing to a revival that leans heavily on automated techniques.
 
I was thinking more of Petr von Blokland's statement "What can be automated will be automated, what cannot be automated is design." That defines the disputed territory. I don't like to see subtle design skills replaced by crude technology. It's all very well to tout averaging as a great new tool, but the averaging idea is not new. I believe Adobe Garamond for one, uses it. 

Automated averaging, used as a design platform, is a blunt and facile instrument. As an analytical tool, it really doesn't help the (re)designer understand the typeface in the way that looking at a variety of instances and drawing one's own composite does. 

>Averaging isn’t necessarily blurry. 

Well, I said it wasn't sharp. Usually sharp is contrasted with blurry, but in the case of averaging type outlines, what one ends up with is not a blur, but a hard edged blob. It's not blurry, but it's not sharp, because it has soft corners.

That glosses over the difference between Art and Design that I'm trying to address; the difference between self-expression and serving others. The former hates analysis, the latter requires it. Considering everything else I've read you write, I suspect that's the crux of your rejection of Raph's effort. All I'm trying to do is understand, everything, yes using personal contexts too. And I do this to improve myself... I need that badly! I'd like to understand why people hate/love the things they do, and make the fonts they do, sort of like reverse-engineering*, and grasping what's in their heads is a crucial key. And I think there's a strong parallel here with revivalism: if you get an idea of what the old dead guy was thinking (which is most apparent in the sorts, not the sloppy printing of them) you will do a much better job.

> I don’t like to see subtle design skills replaced by crude technology.

But this isn't about that. Anybody making a revival should be interested in the original. And this technology helps in that. It's really quite obvious. It doesn't replace, it guides, that's all. Think of it as an astrolabe.

Well of course it isn't. Nobody is saying that. Raph's work however is a quantum leap.

?!
And what does, shrooms?

?
It was a question! Just answer it (if you like). Please explain to me what I don't understand about your stance. Assuming you <strong>are</strong> interested in defending your views (where a tiny bit of self-doubt would help too), as opposed to merely stating them.

I was afraid you'd pull a whine-and-split... How is my questioning more insulting than "revival is not type design"? You have shades? I'm <strong>Mister</strong> Shades!  :-)  As much as I don't have much of a taste for revivalism (and it's quite sad that you're trying your darnest to make sure not to appear to be agreeing with me on that), I embrace its utility: it puts bread on the table (repeating the past/present always does) and it's a form of celebration (and society needs that); but just as important is theory/progress, and this is an area where controlling one's fear of technology is crucial.

It wasn't questioning.
In the first place, you said I don't understand what Raph is doing.

I'm not prepared to continue the discussion after being forced into that kind of corner.

As Peter hints, revivalism is complex.

I would ask: Who is the font for? Other type designers? Quite unlikely. What is for example THE Baskerville for the contemporary user? Is it JB's original? No way - virtually nobody has seen that. I would argue that it is more the impression that people have accumulated over time (a lot like what Nick wrote in another thread) from all the Baskervilles they've seen. So for example take the "a" in Monotype's Baskerville. I find it quite ugly; I would never make that on my own. And John Hudson has argued (on the ATypI list) that it's not necessarily the historic form. But really, it doesn't matter: it's what people know, and my commission is to provide something archetypical. So my revival will have that ugliness (just not exactly the same). To me, that's good design.

Nick, I beg to differ. It's simply your opinion.

First, revivalists are never given a complete Adobe character set. Foundry types almost universally <strong>never</strong> include daggers; section marks; braces; commercial ats; math operators; currency symbols other than those of the country in which the bodies were cast; or oe and ae dipthongs, eths, thorns or German double-esses. In order to include those characters in a font, they have to be <strong>designed</strong>.

Second, <strong>most</strong> revivalists credit their sources, when they are known: no one is trying to hoodwink anyone here. As I have stated before, the whole idea behind revivalism is to make typographic resources available to a computerized world which heretofore existed only as metal type or handlettering on a page. You might not consider the process to be creative, but it is transformational, and it requires patience, judgment and an eye for design.</div>

Pursue an argument? I'm communicating my view that you're missing something - and I just said you understand the gist of it just fine - the details however are important. Are you listening to the communications, or just blasting a deeper trench?

> I didn’t say you were macho. I said it was a macho comment.

But I said it. It came from my head. There you go again compartmentalizing things, removing context. Although you didn't do me that favor when I once wrote "that makes you sound stupid". (You see, Nick, it won't work - not with me.)

> As are your frequent quips about “artistes” expressing themselves.

Well, I think they're a problem. Would you rather I dispense with the humor? I doubt it. Would you rather I shut up? Well, of course. But that ain't gonna happen.

Fortunately, I'm not out to compliment you.
Some of your fonts sometimes though, yes.

No, it's what the word "design" means.

There is a distinction between someone coming up with the idea for a typeface, and realizing it in some form or other, and someone else building on that idea.

The originator designs the <strong>basic pattern</strong> of a typeface, and subsequent adapters and revivalists follow that. Following a design is not designing, it's interpreting. Nothing wrong with that, but it's not design.

Bob Dylan never wrote any guitar solos for "All Along the Watchtower", but that doesn't make Jimi Hendrix the composer.</div>

Nick, I would humbly suggest that the word "design" has a certain meaning to you; unfortunately, your meaning is not the <em>only</em> meaning the word can have . I would also suggest that you check out the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, the ultimate reference source for the English language, to see exactly how many <em>other</em> possible meanings the word has, very few of which agree with you. If you cannot, for a moment, accept the fact that there may be other valid definitions of the creative process, I would further suggest that you lay off the nose candy, or whatever else it is that gives you the idea that your words carry the same authority as, say, the Ten Commandments.</div>

That makes a lot of sense. But it is still a face with spotty color. For instance, "e-n" and "e-r" don't have the same space between them. Maybe what it needs in the digital domain is either some fancy kerning, or alternate forms (courtesy of OpenType). I can't accept that the poor color is a Fleischmannian necessity.</div>

Does anybody literally-revive <strong>spacing</strong>, at the micro level?! Besides Justin Howes I mean. Maybe they should? But you certainly can't think so.

Fancy?
Why would it need more than good basic spacing and simple kerning?

Wait, I don't get it. Are you saying that Fleischmann's work has poor color? At the font level?
And what does that have to do with this again?

William, my words were very carefully chosen and they were not an attack on Nick, only his definition of "creativity." I am not dissing the man, just challenging some of his mistaken notions, which is what lively discussions are supposed to be about.

Unless one possesses the power to say "Let there be light" and light does indeed come into being where it did not exist before, <strong>nothing</strong> a human being does is creative. Rather, if a mere mortal "creates" something new and unique, it is merely an act of <strong>synthesis</strong>, building on what came before. And nowhere is this fact <strong>more</strong> true than in the area of typeface design. The basic rules of letterforms are fixed: the design of an A, no matter how unique, must suggest, unequivocally, an archetypal A to the viewer of same, or the design is utter worthless.

Equally, unless one is prepared to state--also unequivocally--that any nuances one may devise for an alphabet have never, in the entire history of mankind, ever been conceived of before (which statement must, by necessity, proceed from Divine omniscience), then one cannot legitimately claim to be a "creator," when lesser mortals (here read, mere revivalists) are not.

Finally, Nick: enough of the Hrant bashing. I believe that Hrant would be the first to admit that, at times in the past, he has gotten a little edgy and insulting, but...I believe that, within this particular forum, he has been restrained and has offered a lot of constructive criticism and helpful insight. You don't have to cut the guy any slack: just give him his due.

Now YOU're sounding Hestonian, Nick.

It's not about nuances. It's about resolving a unique set of design principles.
But as a matter of fact, I have devised quite a few never-before conceived nuances.
Not that they necessarily have any great typographic value, but they are original.

>trying to hide your disdain for the oeuvre of many accomplished type designers,

Sorry, is my disdain showing? But really, I don't understand why you'd think I have disdain for people who do revivals. There's plenty to admire. Sure, I respect original typefaces more, but everyone has their preferences, that doesn't mean they detest what they don't adore. Also, while I occasionally deplore the general state of affairs (the glass half empty part of it), I'm not going to point fingers at anyone (except of course font bundlers), least of all indie foundry designers. When I say "revival is not design", my purpose is to respect the original designer of a typeface -- not to insult the revivalist, but to question their (or a third party's) use of the term "designer" for the bezier-wrangling.

>Does anybody literally-revive spacing,

Look at the pairs I mentioned: the extra serif on the foot of the "r" means that "e_n" will create more of a hole in text than "e_r". This could be solved by kerning, or by a contextual alternate form of e with a longer tail.

>Are you saying that Fleischmann’s work has poor color?

No, but if Christian Gothic has a divergence of letterforms, for Fleischmannian reasons, that's problematic (as is often the case when diverging from the norms of centiuries) for text colour.

1) You don't know that.

3) Nuances can exist just in the "simple" act of revival too.

Not any more. It used to. You seem a lot more careful now. Maybe it's part of becoming mainstream?

Well sure (if the whole is tight enough). I was wondering about your "fancy"... How many pairs do you typically define for let's say basic Latin?

What are these reasons, exactly? I hope you're not sticking with the view that he was an Emigre-style designer. <strong>That</strong> would be a reason for his descendants to get pissed.  :-)

No, structural divergence (the important, interesting stuff) does not preclude even color.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm going to gently disagree with Nick on a number of points.

First, I believe my averaging technique <em>does</em> produce sharp results, both in the sense of edge acuity and curvature at corners. Keep in mind we're looking at a 14pt glyph here; on a typical 96dpi screen, that means we're looking at 25x magnification, or 50x for the last image I posted.

Second, your e_r vs. e_n argument doesn't convince me that there's a color problem, for two reasons. For one, note that the left serif of the 'r' is shorter than the left serif of the 'n', so the stroke is closer in (the distance between the right tip of the 'e' and the left serif is pretty much the same). That, in turn, balances the perception of greater space due to the lack of a projecting lower left serif on the 'n'.

Also, ideal spacing for a printed page may well not be ideal spacing for an enlargement viewed on screen. I've proposed before that as size increases, gaps become relatively more important, and distances between stems relatively less. So even if e_n still looks a bit gappy to you, that perception may go away completely at actual printed size.

There are significant differences between the various sizes of this font, and these differences have a definite impact on color. I very deliberately chose the 14pt size, mostly because I liked its color best. One of the most important tasks facing a "digitizing interpreter" (or whatever term seems most appropriate) is to choose between the various sources available. There's an unhealthy tendency, I think, to seek out large sizes for their sharpness and robustness to printing variations. The averaging technique has the potential to change this balance, and more clearly reveal the cool stuff going on in the smaller sizes.

In particular, at about 5 o'clock, at the thinnest part of the stroke, you should be able to see a dark-gray stripe nestled inside a blacker outline. I believe the dark-gray is actually a good image of the metal, while the outline is composed of ink spread. If so, hopefully I can unlock one of the last mysteries in my quest to understand ATF's optical scaling, to wit the relative contribution to thickening from the pantograph and the ink spread on printing. I'm looking forward to getting some time to refine my techniques so I can capture even clearer images - the ones I've posted here are still a bit murkier than I'd like, especially for visualizing these more subtle aspects.

In any case, hopefully we can dispense with much of the flamewar on this thread, as I am indeed not making any particular claims to creativity. The main reasons I'm doing this font are to learn more, and to refine my tools. I feel good about the progress on those goals even if this font is never used for anything other than the nameplate on the front door of my new apartment.

Yes I do. Admittedly I haven't seen every font ever made, but I feel reasonably sure that I would have come across certain things if they had been done previously. Such as an oldstyle italic monowidth unicase font, for instance. (A structural concept, but one requiring considerable nuancing to execute.)

>You seem a lot more careful now.

Hopefully one learns from one's mistakes. Type designers can be extremely sensitive to even the most objectively couched analysis, which coming from a peer can seem a bit high and mighty.

>I was wondering about your “fancy”

Just the idea that an e_n kern might be useful.

>structural divergence (the important, interesting stuff) does not preclude even color.

Well, that's the big challenge, isn't it.


Raph:

>sharp results, both in the sense of edge acuity and curvature at corners.

I don't see that. In the original scan there are a number of sharp features, even at the low resolution. It may be uncertain as to which are parts of the design and which are artefacts (and averaging would differentiate), but nonetheless, there is a quality of sporadic sharpness (aka sparkle?) to the individual impression, which disappears in the average.

Also, consider that the quality of different pieces of type will vary, both in mint condition and through varying wear. An average is less than top quality. In the same way, certain imprssions will be "sweeter" than others, due to slight variations in paper and inking. Again, the average dulls the best quality, and it is up to the discriminating eye to discern what is best. 

The e_r vs. e_n space: the absence of a lower left serif on the 'n" creates a baseline opening between the letters, so although the fit is slightly tighter, it allows contigual white space to interupt the x-height's evenness.

>So even if e_n still looks a bit gappy to you, that perception may go away completely at actual printed size.

I've designed many text faces, and took that into account.

>my quest to understand ATF’s optical scaling

Why don't you work with a face where you also have access to the metal type? Then you could compare that with the impression, rather than deduce it.

>hopefully we can dispense with much of the flamewar 

I apologize for inadverently flaming you, as a result of my ongoing headbutting with Hrant. What you're doing is fascinating, and creative, and throws a number of philosophical design issues into the spotlight.</div>

I am utterly flabbergasted. That <strong>statement</strong> is, at the very least, rather provincial and narrow-minded, although "pompous," "self-serving" and "incredibly arrogant" work well, too. And, <strong>please notice</strong> that these comments are directed at the <strong>statement</strong>, nor the stater.

Nick, you continue to confuse <em>fact</em> and <em>opinion</em>. You are welcome to state your opinions, but please do not elevate them to the status of irrefutable truth, especially when the strongest case you can make for the statements is, "Because I say so."

As difficult for you as it may be, you have to come to terms with the old saw that there are few things <em>really new</em> under the sun. The wheel was a marvelous invention, but it was not without precedent in the natural world. Similarly, there were anthills before there were pyramids, water droplets before there were telescopes, and supernovas before there were atomic bombs.

I do not believe that anyone else here is belittling the kind of type design you pursue--in fact, I believe you have received praise for it from some unlikely quarters. So, please, don't belittle the kind of type design that other people pursue, simply because it doesn't fit your <em>opinion</em> of what a type designer should do.</div>

You're criticizing me for daring to claim some originality for some of my work.
The onus is not on me to prove originality, but on you to disprove it.

Nonsense. There are new inventions all the time, including typefaces.
The principle that separates a collection of reused parts from an amalgam that becomes something new is that of emergence, where the whole is smarter than the sum of the parts:

I do see ad hominem arguments coming from Hrant, but this is expected, as Hrant has defended them as legitimate. 

But I am quite surprised to see them coming from you, as you started a thread about proper discussion rules. I have taught introductory university courses on logic, so I am aware of the issues here.

You're not paying attention. The average provides information as to what the original was, <strong>then</strong> you can decide what to do with it. Especially considering that offset printing is so regular, it's pretty artificial to fake things the way you're proposing.

My definition: when I design a typeface, unless it's specifically a display face, I test prototypes in text settings to refine the color. I look at the fonts in sizes from 6 to 14 pt, in different column widths, ragged and justified, tight and open leading. On a couple of newspaper fonts, I've tested prototypes on newsprint. As I said, I've designed many text faces: Beaufort, Bodoni Egyptian, Brown, Fontesque Text, Goodchild, Merlin, Oneleigh, Paradigm, Shinn Sans, Richler, Worldwide. All these fonts come with sidebearings wide enough, and apertures open enough, for text setting. Some of them turned out with better text colour than others, obviously, and Merlin is a bit of a stretch as a text face (the Italic is better than the roman, actually), but they were all designed primarily as text faces. Your definition?

Huh? I offer a critique of an anaytical method, and you respond with "You don't understand." Take a look at Raph's raw scan side-by-side with his averaged outcome: the quality of sharpness has gone missing. This issue is not especially obvious in the "S",  but in the joint of the "n", where the hairline joins the main stem, it will be quite problematic. 

>the textbook struggle between Art and Design, between expression and function, between the self and others. 

I wish you'd stop laying this "art/expression/selfish" trip on me. I'm assessing the technical aspects of this font, and Raph's averaging technique, from my experience as a type designer/craftsman, making fonts that I sell for a living, which the people who buy use to set type. The dichotomy that interests me is between handcraft and automation, and where the boundary falls. </div>

Bringing my previous remarks about dichotomies into the handcraft / automation arena: Isn't your problem with averaging that it averages, not that is automated? Posterizing could solve the indistinctness_of_the_countour problem. This might be a useful starting point for autotracing, but this wouldn't necessarily preculude craft decisions about normalizing brezier curves and the rest. Such normalization, if that is the best word for it, would occur probably in conversation with the actual range of impressions, including its outliers and relevant similar features in role-architecturally similar components as much as in conversation with the averaged item.</div>

I agree, although I would caution against the term "proof". Since this is not a science, some people will always see what they want. Like the pen in Legato.

> Can it truly be said the the choice for or against averaging
> is tantamount to a binary choice between the self and others.

No, humans are not binary. But concepts are "pure". We're each always in the middle, along different points on the "axes" of opposites. A person's aversion to or admiration for Raph's technique is an aspect of the argument of Art versus Design. And the reason to address the pure extremes is that I think it's the only way to understand the middle.

> Not shooting; surely not the same as making a smaller target?

I don't know, Nick, what else to call avoidance of direct questions, and answers that don't tell the whole picture, or sometimes not even the central point?

The way not to be a target is not to feel like one; or maybe not to <strong>want</strong> to be one...

> We’ve been there, done that — ITC and Typsettra faces
> of the 1970s, generally considered too grey, today.

We haven't done jack. Admitting that some fonts are too gray only tells us there's an issue. Yippee. Introducing variance in typographic color for aesthetic effect (color hooliganism?) is child's play. I'm talking about function here.

We have no idea what we're doing. We don't even grasp Familiarity!! Have we "arrived"? Laughable. We've only arrived at a mundane, crass place. Let's leave.

> I’ve designed many text faces

It doesn't matter how many times you repeat it, Nick.

Also: almost anybody can make a text face imitatively. When you know a model works, because it has for so long, aping it to arrive at yet another text face is... not type design?  :-)

> I offer a critique of an anaytical method

That was not critique, that was rejection.
And you do it all the time; just like you did with Larson.

> Merlin is a bit of a stretch as a text face

Riiight.

I can't wait to see Eunoia-Text used for a book.

> Your definition?

I'm working on it. No actually, I'm working on the <strong>fonts</strong>, not the definition. But I do know when I see one that isn't.

> Therefore, all those who make fonts.

To different degrees, yes. Each of us has both the artist and the craftsman in him. It becomes a matter of honesty, and selflessness. Somebody who's a readability relativist is closer to the Art end of the axis than somebody who spends years reasearching and thinking about the very real mechanics of human cognition.

BTW, are you now saying that Raph's technique is useful to all those who make fonts? If you were making a literal revival (even if you'd probably have to be commissioned to do so) and you had it freely available to you, would you use it?

> the quality of sharpness has gone missing.

I think you're seeing what you want to see.

> I wish you’d stop laying this “art/expression/selfish” trip on me.

And I wish you'd shed your aversion to technique.

Now what?

> making fonts that I sell for a living

Maybe I meant proof as in a smoke proof. :-) Certainly not as in a scientific proof ( which is also subject to revisting after all and is just a prepondernace of current evidence). I just mean the evidence to know if it has value isn't all there yet. And when it is it's up to each of us to judge or to hold off & continue being skeptically interested & maybe hopeful. What is being discussed now is a technique. I just mean trhat the value of that technique can be judged later on by it's resulting product. Via Ralph in this case.

I mean useful in principle. I can't go beyond that, as the tool is still in development. It might be something that I could use in the future, but I can't say how. New tools aren't always used for their intended purposes.

At the moment, I'm working on a revival, but taking a quite opposite approach. I've scanned and traced glyphs in the past, but the method I'm now using is a magnifying glass to look at the printed image, and bezier-drawing the glyphs "by eye". Right brain analysis.</div>

I suppose there's just enough neo-Ludditism in that particular approach to revivalism to qualify it as novel.

It's the first time I've used a magnifying glass, and it's the first time I've made an "exact" facsimile. (From a 12 pt text setting in an 1869 book.)
My previous revivals were more interpretative, and my source material was much larger, from specimen books usually.

The first outline font I made was a process of looking closely (no magnifying glass) at a classic Armenian metal face, and recreating the forms directly in bezier... on a grid! A slanted grid!! Needless to say, it came out like crap. The two reasons for this [process] were that: I didn't know that I didn't have the talent to do it, and didn't know the dark side of the grid; and that I didn't have a scanner. But it wasn't artificial. Not using available tools though is too... artsy :-) for me.

Well, "loupe" certainly doesn't conjure up visions of deerstalker hats and calabash pipes in the same way that "magnifying glass" does, but that's not really the point. I inferred, and I believe you implied, that there is something unique in the method you have chosen to undertake this project which sets it apart from the methods of other revivalists. I am fairly confident that even those revivalists who scan and autotrace their character have to draw the missing characters and subject them to the same conversion process as their "found" characters, so that all of the characters in their fonts retain the same rough edges. In the process, they too are using their eyes <em>and</em> their hands. So, your approach is unique because...?

>Isn’t your problem with averaging that it averages, not that is automated? Posterizing could solve the indistinctness_of_the_countour problem.

No, that would change (opposite of sharp) blurry to (opposite of sharp) smooth. Still not sharp.

My general awareness of averaging is that it highlights certain information at the expense of other information. For instance, if you average an 80-10-90 triangle and a 10-80-90 triangle, you end up with a 45-45-90 triangle, losing the quality of sharpness.

Hrant:

>Isn’t the conscious introduction of “uncertainty” artificial?

That's what I'm saying: the inherent uncertainty of averaging (a refined form of guesswork) is artificial. It creates a slightly vague simulacrum of the original. Drawing a purposeful interpretation is more "genuine".

>Not using available tools though is too… artsy :-) for me.

I wouldn't say that a selected use of more traditional techniques is peculiarly artsy, because a lot of modern artists have abandoned the traditional tools, these last 30 or so years. Also, drawing was a technique used by all designers, including engineers, as Michael Harvey pointed out in his talk at TypeCon2004. </div>

Huh?. In response to Hrant's question of whether I would use Raph's averager, I just described how I was doing a revival at the moment in a somewhat opposite fashion. You're the one that said it was novel, and then Dan said it was how many people did it.

I don't think the <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/xgothic/n_enh.png">image</a> fully supports this assertion. Ink does tend to pool a bit at such joins, but that is the nature of letterpress printing. In any case, you can fairly clearly see that it's ink rather than metal in this image, because the ink is imaged darker than the adjacent metal impression.

I don't know what you're able to see here, but to me it's as if I were seeing images from the Hubble Space Telescope for the first time, and some of the people around me were saying, "but the atmospheric variation is part of the experience of viewing stars. Would you deny the romance embodied in "twinkle twinkle little star" in your embrace of cold space-based telescopes?" Screw that.

Looking at what was there 'clearly' may or may not be best served by your technique. Cool as it is. And it is cool I think! Very cool. After you post more stuff more folks may be convinced. I am about half way there. I might still rather look at 30 or 300 specimens on paper & judge what I think is best in them... or by looking directly at metal if I had it. Clearly you have something there. If it's the metal I don't know. Even if it isn't showing the metal it might be a great tool anyway for other reasons.

But then, what happens AFTER your find or develop a clear reference. If you have an absolutely ideal reference set - with punches even; still, you still have to decide if you are going to be slavishly litteral to whatever source or reinterpret using whatever technique of hand or mind. No matter what tools or techniques you use you still have to make some judgements about the digitization. And no matter your intentions some elements your chosen process will impact the results even if it's only because it shapes or influences your thought. Those two things will both influence the product. This is the part that I still find most interesting.

Speaking of which, how do you plan to use your averaged & processed image? Will you import into illustrator & draw a vector over it so you can see your greyscale image? 

What is your intent for that line? Do you want to get the metal & then let a little ink into your outline? Like in the joint of the n? Or is it the technique of finding the metal hidden in the impressions that is dearer to you? 

What would anybody else do? I understand the idea of looking for the spirit of the thing - but let's say you have a perfect metal specimen plus lots of impressions - Then what? Nick S, you say you are drawing by eye - I can imagine it causes you to look more closely at shapes & be less rote in your construction. Sort of like doing a 'Countour Drawing' of a nude figure in art school. It forces you to be more deliberate - not looking down at the paper. I am I intuiting what your up to there? Hrant- what's your technique? Dan? Old Nick?

Spill some more beans please. :-)

I'm seeing what I anticipated, which is that while the technique is excellent along the main stretches, it is not much help at sharp corners -- the top left and right corners, the bottom right corner, and the inside joint. At these points interpretation is required, and that interpretation will determine much of the character of the revival.

To continue your analogy of the Hubble: If one is familiar with metal type, one has already been to the stars, and knows what they look like. So one is able to filter out the haze when looking at them from afar. 

Eben: well said. It's waay cool, but what happens next, and how does this change that?

>am I intuiting what your up to there?

Sort of. I went to the loupe because on this particular face I wasn't having much success with other techniques. I've long believed that a metal-to-digital, letterpress-to-offset revival is about (re)creating an effect, so there's lots of scope for how you do it.

Peter,

You have made several comments in this forum that I have found rather puzzling; perhaps others have, perhaps not--I can only speak for myself. In any event, may I suggest that erudition which elucidates is always welcome and appreciated, whereas erudition which obfuscates doesn't really contribute a lot. In other words: fewer three-dollar words, a little more clarity.</div>

Being a liberal who is regularly and infuriatingly labelled fascist by Hrant, this phrase struck me as delightful, hilarious, and apt. 

Peter's rhetorical style was the subject of a lengthy <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/9736">discussion</a>.

On topic: I think Raph's technique can be very useful in analysing old typefaces, and so could be helpful to others as well. 

However, I do feel that strict copies of faces, particularly pre-20th century, are less useful than revivals that use past designs, but add some creative input to make them more suitable and desirable for today.  </div>

Sorry, I can't show this face just yet.
And the way things are going with the number of glyphs required for OT fonts these days, it will be several years down the road. On the bright side, screen resolution will have improved by then, so I won't have to worry about hinting it.

What I meant by scope was that there are many different ways to repurpose a type design, both by different techniques, and different intentions. For instance, compare (digital) Bauer Bodoni with ITC Bodoni and Fiosofia. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ductal logic: Ductus is the path the writing implement makes in forming a letter. Typefaces are formed by other tools than the (broadnibbed or flexical) pen, but the contrast patterns of the shapes that are constructed in type traditionally paraphrase the shapes formed by the stroke of the pen. Every typeface that deliberately imitates the broadnibbed pen has (or borrows) a ductal logic. This can be more or less worked out and more or less consistently followed.

In Gerrit Noordzij's type descriptive scheme we can think of the marks left by the broad edge of the pen as a moving front of points. The moving front of points can proceed straightforwardly without modification (translation) or can expand in response to increased pressure of the writing tool as it moves, or it can rotate as it moves. The path followed can include penlifts or proceed without penlifts from stroke to stroke. Figuring all this out in relation to a typeface, I call 'doing the frontal arithmetic'. 

My use of the term 'role architecture' in describing parts of letterforms and how they combine goes back to a Douglas Hofstadter essay in Visible Language on Donald Knuth's concept of a Metafont. It has its uses, but I admit, it can stand in the way of clarity for those who aren't familiar with it. I don't think it obfuscates.

Perhaps I need to construct Wikipedia definitions for some of these pet terms.

Thanks for sharing that, Nick: it's a nicely turned phrase, if perhaps a trifle redundant (are there other kinds of circumlocution which <em>don't</em> involve language?).

I, too, am curious about "ductal logic"; to me, it sounds as if it ought to involve things bilious or lachrymose. Perhaps <strong>ductile</strong> (easily led; tractable; complying; yielding to motives, persuasion, or instruction) is a more appropriate adjective. And, is the arithmetic partially frontal, or is it full frontal?</div>

I've never done a literal revival. If/when I do, I'll be sure to beg Raph for his algorithm. And I will do the same if/when I need to better understand an old face that's only visible through -inadequate- printing. That's the sort of thing this is useful for, nothing more; but rejecting it outright is a result of fear.

That's assuming all stars are the same, which is obviously wrong.

No, a fascism-apologist; very different.

On typophile I have been foolish enough to talk politics, defending human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and occasionally the right of the state of Israel to exist. You have defended undemocratic monarchy, the superiority of Communism to democracy, the change of government by violence as superior to change by election, and ethnic purity, at least for minorities.

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking of meta-discussion, I forgot to thank Nick for his kind words about 60 posts ago, apologizing for inadvertently flaming me. Apology accepted, and thanks. Words do make a difference.

I just created a wiki entry for [[Metafont]]. Peter, feel more than free to add a squib referencing your Typo article.

Nick: we'll have to agree to disagree on whether the "n" image is sufficiently sharp. I do agree that the technique is extremely effective along the body of strokes (I'm especially impressed by its ability to clearly visualize the wiggles on the hairline), and trickier to interpret at corners. As for the outside corners, many of those show wear patterns, and you may be conflating that with actual loss of sharpness. I see the distinction fairly clearly (although I must admit that autotracing the outlines would probably not be able to see the distinction). One interesting direction to pursue would be a finer classification into intact and damaged impressions, so that it would be possible to visualize a composite of only the former. (indeed, my present classification logic does tend to reject badly damaged letters, and has caught a few other surprises, such as one instance of an upside down 'u' standing for an 'n').

I have not carefully analyzed the "ductal logic" of Christian Gothic, largely because I'm not very knowledgeable about blackletters (as I've said, one of the reasons I'm studying this is to learn more). My gut feeling is that, for the lowercase, the ductal logic will follow traditional blackletters fairly closely (the 1484 Collard Mansion I cited upthread is the closest match I was able to find; of more "famous" sources, Caxton's blackletter comes pretty darn close). The uppercase is more of a mystery, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Plantin/Tavernier Civilite cited by Hrant turned out to be a good match. I'm certainly going to haul out my books when I get them unpacked and comb through the Civilites.

You're right, but I think that both things happen.
The straighter the contour, the sharper it is, a mathematical relationship.

Corners are more prone to wear, and that wear is more likely to be sharp and irregular, which will create a blur. 

However, fuzzier corners is also a feature of the averaging process.
Try this: set a character with very sharp serifs (eg Beaufort) at very large size in Photoshop. Apply Gaussian Blur. It's blurrier at the points. (Apply unsharp mask to heighten the effect.)
This seems to be related in some way. All very mind boggling.
