  body: "Why do you believe it's a font? (It could be handwritten). Do you have anything
    that shows repeated letters?\r\n\r\nI searched Dafont and looked through a lot
    of MyFonts informal scripts trying to find at least a similar mix of such casual
    lettering. The [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/gfy-handwriting-fontpak/|GFY
    Handwriting Fontpak]] from Chank has a couple that might be combined to re-create
    something quite similar (mix J from Peggy and lower case from Ralston).\r\n\r\n-
