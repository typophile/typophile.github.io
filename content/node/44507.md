body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nI am mainly a Production Artist, but I have a client who has
  asked me to come up for a new logo for her homeowners association. Logos are NOT
  my forte and I actually cringe when someone asks me to do one. I always try to give
  it a shot though.\r\n\r\nA little background:\r\n* they currently use 2 logos -
  one is a flower pot and the other is a phoenix. they hate both\r\n* the history
  is that the neighborhood came together to help each other after a 1991 firestorm\r\n*
  they are actively involved in the community\r\n* they want something 1C, simple
  and stylish\r\n\r\nThe top 5 logos are what I have submitted so far and have been
  rejected. The bottom two are ones I am working on... their feedback from the top
  logos was:\r\n\r\nan image with hills and the rest using NHPA\r\nuse NHPA in some
  creative way\r\ndo the image in medium or dark green\r\n\r\nAny feedback help anyone
  can give is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nhpa_logo_4466.jpg]"

  body: 2nd in the right hand column is the only one I'm drawn too. These all seem
    a bit chunky, inject a bit of flair and personality into them. Find something
    in the community you can latch on too for an overall theme.

  body: "Yes, second from the top in the right hand column is the strongest.  Maybe
    adding a sense of depth to the houses so that they're not all uniform might work.
    \ In any case, that's the best direction to work with, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

    work with/behind the letterforms.\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"
