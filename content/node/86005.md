  talk at the <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/expert-class-type-design-graduation-and-exhibition/\">graduation
  ceremony</a> of the <em>Plantin Institute of Typography</em> on the 10th of September,
  I mentioned that it is rather strange that visitors of the Museum Plantin-Moretus
  are allowed to keep their shoes on. One would expect that in this Holy Temple of
  Typography visitors are requested to take their shoes off. On the other hand, this
  could have a negative effect on the substance and quality of the atmosphere in the
  museum, and hence on the precious collection.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plantoffels_1_4059.jpg]\r\nSo,
  my suggestion was that future visitors of the museum should wear <em>Plantoffels</em>\u2122.
  \u2018Pantoffel\u2019 is the Dutch word for indoor slipper and the brand name <em>Plantoffels</em>\u2122
  \uFB01nds its origin in the surname and name of Chris<strong>toffel</strong> <strong>Plan</strong>tin.
  I can imagine though that also outside the museum there will be a lot of interest
  in <em>Plantoffels</em>\u2122, so these will become available online shortly (exclusively
  from DTL, of course). The shoe sizes will be de\uFB01ned in several mutually incomparable
  systems, as in the best typographic tradition.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Plantoffels_2_5855.jpg]\r\nFEB"

    Dutch wit. Of course, they often go together.
