  I have been trying to hunt down the complete character set to no avail. I'm not
  necessarily looking for a digitized version of it, but if anyone had more information

  body: Seems like I've seen more of this alphabet, but I can't remember where. There
    is a Dover book called Florid and Unusual Alphabets, or something like that, but
    I don't have it handy. It may be in that.
