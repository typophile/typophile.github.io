  Without [[Joshua Lurie-Terrell|this man]] I would have no good sense, no good taste,
  no beach camping, no gourmet palette, and no <em>[[Typographica]]</em>.\r\n\r\nAnd
  yes, that image in the attachment is the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jlt/3180329\">best
  photo</a> I could find. I like it because it's fun to imagine JLT with a mustache."

    what my doctor's birthday gift to me was this morning? telling me that my blood

    that.\r\n\r\n35, or 20 + 15, as Tiffany calls it ... it will take me at least
    5 years to get used to being 35. I don't understand how this happened, I was,
    like, 19 a coupla weeks ago. Where did this car and house and wife and mortgage
    and direct deposit all come from?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com
