body: "Hello, I am new to this site and not really all that computer savy.  I make
  decorative home signs (not commercial)  I at present have Font Twister which allows
  me to disfigure the text.  But it doesn't let me really do what I want.  I am looking
  for a program that will allow me to use rounded arch.  Also to adjust the letters
  without having to manually go in and resize each one.  I don't need anything expense
  since this is just used for very small projects. Any suggestion, anyone.  \r\nHere
  is my site which will give you a better idea of what I do.  Thanks\r\n\r\nwww.SuchesCrafts.com"

    Also, though more specific for editing and creating fonts, there's Fontforge (which
    is free).

  body: Wow ... this is completly over my head.  It's all foreign to me.  For example
    I have Paint shop.  But it's to involved for what I need it for.  I don't need
    to edit photo's just create different looking fonts and styles (deform) I guess
    is the word.  Just learned that one today!
