body: "I'm starting to do freelance design work, so I'm making a logo. The idea behind
  it is a shortening of my last name--Von Kannenberg--to vonk. The lame visual pun
  I've got is \"v on k\"--literally fusing the forms of a v and k. I'm hoping to make
  an animated version that starts with \"vonk\" and collapses down, leaving the logo.\r\n\r\nI've
  started exploring with one of my favorite Didots--I love the letterforms and they
  are combining pretty well so far, I think. The problem is that I've started seeing
  uk instead of vk. Then I'll go do something else for a while and it'll be vk again
  when I come back. It's maddening. \r\n\r\nWhat do you see when you look at these?
  Is this a good direction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*versions E and F are intended for use
  at large sizes.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking."

    connection between the mark and your name it'll cement the fact that it's \"vk\",
    not \"uk\".\r\n\r\nI say great work so far, keep going with what you've got here
    and post any updates.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: Same here - VK is easily to pick up from all 4 versions. For what it's worth
    I really like version C, I think it is balanced really well.

    C seems the best. I need to start designing my site/cards/etc. so I can get to
    promoting, but I've started playing with two other Didots that are looking pretty
    nice as well. Now it's just a matter of executing version C in each to see which
    is the best. \r\n\r\nI'll put up another PDF when they're ready."

  body: "I got 'vk' from all of them, though I can see how someone would see 'uk'.
    I'm concerned that some people will see 'ik' from D. However, that depends a lot
    on context. C seems like a good way to avoid that.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already,
    show this to some people who aren't designers. I bet they'll say things that will
    surprise you. These marks are a little like those optical illusions that flicker
    back and forth from one interpretation to another, if you're looking to see something
    in them."

    and could be read as UK. I really, really enjoy the subtle stencilling in version
    b. '

  body: "Thanks, eliason.\r\n\r\nI can see the point about reading ik, especially
    on version d. There's a new PDF on the original post with some new versions, some
    with a less-round v and some different typefaces.\r\n\r\nMiss Tiffany, I'm glad
    you like the stenciling. That's something I like, too. Once the basic mark is
    finished, I'll make a stenciled version and probably end up using that. "

    personality. To me, a and c are the most balanced of these newer ones.\r\n\r\nI
    really liked the flavor of the ones from the first round though. The shapes remind
    me a lot of [[http://www.siscottstudio.com/|Si Scott's]] work \u2014 especially
    e and f. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Thanks, penn and  SuperUltraFabulous.\r\n\r\nI think A and C are the strongest
    here, too, Penn. Even though I love the H&FJ Didot (version A), there's something
    about the compact curviness of C that's starting to win me over. I think the thicker
    thin strokes will be safer than A at small sizes, not to  mention $300 is not
    something I can afford right now.\r\n\r\nI fully intend to make \"hollowed-out\"
    versions (similar to E and F) of the final version for use at large sizes--that
    execution is still very much on the table--as well as the stenciled version from
    the first PDF.\r\n\r\nNow I guess it's down to deciding between C and D.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Took a look @ Sy Scott--nice! I hadn't seen any of that before. I think most of
    what I've been doing has been influenced by [[http://www.typographicposters.com/alex-trochut/|Alex
    Trochut]], but without his level of illustrative ability."
