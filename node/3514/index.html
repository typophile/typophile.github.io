  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,  <BR>  I need to let you know firstly that I&#39;m a chemical engineer with a non-professional interest in typography. <BR> <BR>  Dealing with equations, as I do, I often have need to use superscript &#40;esp. for exponents&#41; and subscript &#40;esp. for indices&#41;.   <BR> <BR>  For purely subjective reasons I want to use the OpenType &#34;Palatino Linotype&#34; font, rather than the default in Windows &#40;&#34;Times New Roman&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>  I&#39;m hoping that you&#39;re not cursing MS by this stage, because I curse it enough as it is.  I need to use MS Word because I need to use a plug-in which &#40;I think&#41; is only compatible with that. <BR> <BR>  Back to the problem.  Formatting in any of the other fonts works perfectly.  It is exclusively in  &#34;Palatino Linotype&#34; that vertical alignments are off &#40;for my purposes&#41;.  I need the bottom of the subscript to be below the line of the main text, and likewise I need the superscript to rise above the capital letter height &#40;sorry, I don&#39;t know the jargon&#41;.  This happens in every other font, but with &#34;Palatino Linotype&#34; the superscipt and subscript in MS Word are set up to be correct for fractions, so that they neither drop below nor rise above e.g. the letter &#34;X&#34;.  &#40;The easiest way is to try this out yourself.&#41; <BR> <BR>  I have contacted MS, who indicated that this is due to the fact the &#34;Palatino Linotype&#34; is their &#39;flagship&#39; OpenType font, packed with all the features - and, of course, MS Word &#40;or Windows?&#41; is not yet compatible with all of them.  It seems this requires MS to make a major overhaul of their software, and is not expected in a patch, or even in the next full version &#40;but perhaps the one after!&#41;. <BR> <BR>  My questions to you are twofold: <BR>&#40;1&#41;  Given that I only need the plug-in while I am composing my prose/equations, can any of you recommend a &#40;Word Processing&#41; programme that will correctly handle equation-style superscripts and subscripts in this font?  E.g. OpenOffice, Star Office? <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41;  Can any of you contact MS and/or start a petition to get the OpenType features implemented as soon as possible?!  I realise that a lot of you may not regularly use MS products, but I do believe you would be doing a service to typography in general &#40;and to me at the very least&#41; by making these features more widely available to people in the &#39;real world&#39; &#40;no offence!&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thank-you,  <BR>  DIV</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,  <BR>  what a surprise to find another Chemical Engineer.  And thanks for the reply. <BR> <BR>I was thinking about importing equations from either LaTeX or MathML into MS Word, but I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s practicable.   <BR>Currently I write &#40;somewhat&#41; complex equations using &#39;Equation Editor&#39; within MS Word.  Although this is not great, it does get the superscripts and subscripts right.  However, when I need to refer to inidividual items in the equations, I prefer to do that in the text, rather than having to open up &#39;Equation Editor&#39; and create a separarte Object.   <BR> <BR>EXAMPLE <BR>Smith and Jones agreed that  <BR>___    x</div>
