  body: "The first one (TACITUS) can be:\r\n\r\n<strong>Thesis SSi [Regular] </strong>
    -  Copyright c 1992 Southern Software, Inc.\r\n<strong>Cochin LT Std [Roman]</strong>
    - Copyright \xA9 1989, 2002 Adobe Systems\r\n<strong>Engravers' Oldstyle 205 [Regular]</strong>
    - Copyright 1990-1999 Bitstream Inc\r\n\r\nAll three matches the TACITUS text
    except of the apostrophe ' \r\nwhich seems to be taken from another typeface.\r\n\r\nThe
    second one (Annals) is: <strong>Elli [Regular]</strong> (c) 1993 Jean Evans\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n\r\nPS:
    I found them using Find my Font utility - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n<strong>PS2:Nina</strong>
    you are so fast! :-)"
