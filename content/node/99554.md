  body: "I'm afraid that's what I saw at first too...\r\n\r\nI think you could add
    a dot to the /i/ without compromising the /n/.\r\n\r\nHiding the tail of the /g/
    that way is probably not necessary, either...\r\n\r\nThen maybe downplay the connection
    between the /l/ and /i/, or add connections between other pairs to make that look
    less like a /u/ and more like a linking stroke."

  body: Could the tail of the /g/ end in a ball terminal that also doubles as the
    tittle? Then let the /l/ ascender flow from top left to bottom right.
