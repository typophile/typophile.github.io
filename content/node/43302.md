  I named the alternate numbers as follows:\r\n\r\none.ss01\r\ntwo.ss01\r\nthree.ss01\r\n\r\nand
  so on\r\n\r\nthe ss01 feature looks like this:\r\n\r\nfeature ss01{\r\nsub one by
  one.ss01;\r\nsub two by two.ss01;\r\nsub three by three.ss01;\r\nsub four by four.ss01;\r\nsub
  five by five.ss01;\r\nsub six by six.ss01;\r\nsub seven by seven.ss01;\r\nsub eight
  by eight.ss01;\r\nsub nine by nine.ss01;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nBut I keep on getting
  this message:\r\n\r\nERROR: There was a problem while compiling OpenType font. Final
  .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition for errors\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s
  wrong? "

  body: Strange. It looks okay. Is this the only feature?

  body: "Gee whiz, I never thought I would be famous in Bulgaria... :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I'm still stumped. \r\n\r\nIt seems odd that the error is only triggered when
    you add the lines for eight or nine. If it were a problem with missing glyphs
    or glyph names, the error would be different (\"missing glyph\" error). If it
    were a problem with Cyrillic characters creeping in, again it would be a different
    error (\"invalid character\" error). Instead, you just get this maddenly vague
    error (\"there's a problem\") which offers no clues. \r\n\r\nHave you tried contacting
    FontLab support? They may be willing to look at the font and tell you what's wrong."

  body: "I got that same error message when I tried to substantially change the kerning
    in an existing Adobe font -- both class & exceptions. FL didn't complain when
    the *features* were compiled (and yes, I made the changes in the features file,
    not the metrics window), but did when I tried to generate the .otf.\r\n\r\nI never
    solved it; I assumed I'd just done something to throw it into a loop.\r\n\r\nYou
    might try renaming the alternate characters\r\n\r\nzero.alt\r\none.alt\r\ntwo.alt\r\nthree.alt\r\n.
    . .\r\nnine.alt\r\n\r\nThen use your stylistic set feature with the replacement
    names suitably changed. It shouldn't help, but would be easy to do.\r\n\r\nI guess
    I'd also go back & make sure the regular numbers were all OK. Then if it still
    didn't work, give it to FontLab & see if they'll debug it.\r\n\r\nOne thing worth
    trying if you go at it yourself is to limit things. Start a *new* font, and put
    in it only the regular numbers & the alternative numbers. See if it will compile.
    The add the ss01 feature & try again. If that works, there is something else in
    you *old* font getting in the way."

  body: "Ivan,\r\n\r\nJust for the hell of it, I made up a little test font. It had
    only a space character and the numbers 0-9 (from some Stencil font). I added the
    numbers 0-9 from Sistina, named them *zero.ss01* etc., & no Unicode index. Wrote
    a feature -- wrote it out longhand just like you did -- compiled the features
    & made a font. Everything worked fine.\r\n\r\nOpened up ID-CS2, set the numbers
    twice, applied the stylistic set to the second row of numbers -- they changed.
    It even printed out.\r\n\r\nI'd say that whatever is going wrong for you isn't
    specifically your feature, but some inadvertent conflict with something else.\r\n\r\nSorry
    I'm no help, & good luck"
