  project is time comsuming.\r\n\r\nI built typeface testing tool to save hours of
  design and type testing time every week.\_\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontpro.com\"><img
  \ width=\"650\" src=\"http://fontpro.com/img/fontpro-home.png\" style=\"width:650px;\"
  alt=\"Font Pro - Free Fonts and Web Fonts\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontpro.com\">Font
  Pro</a> is built to make easier to work with web type and hopefully make the web
  more beautiful and readable place.  \r\n\r\nWe can start a new project with a blank
  canvas, and get some pretty detail options in minutes. \r\n\r\nSwap the fonts easily
  and apply some basic style such as font size, font style (italic, bold, underline),
  text color, background color, margin, and so on.\r\n\r\nOnce we have done with your
  typeface project, download the html, css, and all web fonts we use for our project
  in at the push of button.\r\n\r\nThis tool is still on beta stage, I am looking
  for feedback and suggestion.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n-------\r\nYudhis\r\nFont

  body: '@chris, basically yes. But we offer that feature for free. Our tool is still
    on beta stage and of course it need a lot of improvements and hard works. We are
    working to add more quality font so we can discover font combinations event better.
    Thanks for your feedback, chris!'
