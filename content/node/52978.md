  acquainted to me, i am a designer from Israel, and a perpetual student, although
  i have finished my 4 years of visual communications studies.\r\n\r\ni am looking
  for a Latin (that is English) font, that looks like a hebrew-language font called
  \"blender\", designed by the talented Michal Sahar from Israel.\r\n\r\ntype sample
  attached:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/27-12-2008 10-56-05_4297.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for something that is similar, and may be modern, funky, cool (which in
  this context means interesting sans serif which is very similar and geometric).\r\n\r\nthanks
  very much, and marry christmas.\r\n:)\r\n\r\n**(further fonts and works of Michal

    rounded.\r\nit belongs to a concept which basically deals with getting from one
    place to another, a very sharp and geometric path.\r\n"

  body: "here is the larger explanation, from an email i have sent to Dan Reinolds:\r\n---\r\n\r\nlately
    i have been studying an extra course, (having finished my design college studies
    in MINSHAR college in israel) of package design. i designed and presented a packaging
    and book covers for something that in hebrew called \"K'fitzat Haderech\". this
    might be femiliar to you from the book Dune by frank herbert. it's a term originaly
    taken from the jewish misticism, and also appears on other religions folklore
    as well (like in islam, maybe when muhammad has transferred from medina or mecca
    to jerusalem).\r\n\r\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefitzat_Haderech\r\n\r\nthe \"kfitzat
    haderech\" i designed, is a packaging related to an imagined art event taking
    place once or twice a year, in which there is an exhibition that takes place in
    several different galleries across tel aviv. one can \"jump\" from one gallery
    to another on a thematic route - for instance - an exhibition regarding a theme
    called \"my body my self\" which belongs to a group of different israeli artists
    from the 70's, using their body as canvas. the spectator can start in a specific
    gallery, and then go on to another gallery which shows a main artist, then the
    route splits to his pupils (his students affected by him), and so on and so on.
    the path may be chronologic, may be thematic.\r\n\r\nwhen dotting the map in search
    for galleries in tel aviv, i immediately noticed the option of routing or \"wiring\"
    one dot to another, creating an imaginary \"web of art\" across the city, in which
    art lovers could hang around. it resembles diagrams of wiring of the internet
    or any social arragement. the wirings create compositions.\r\n\r\nin these links,
    you can see the work yet unpublished - three designed and self-bound (japanese
    binding) books printed on canvas with cloth handles (to carry the catalogue across
    town), a hardback canvas packaging, and a poster. \r\nhere are the images:\r\n\r\nwork
    process:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/work process_5771.jpg]\r\n\r\npresentation
    and packaging:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HAGASHA STRIP_5691.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
    the poster, showing the \"kfitzat haderech\" logo typograhy made from stitched
    cotton threads, plus a main vector wiring composition:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster
    print-FINAL small_4106.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe poster advertises the \"my body
    my self\" 70's artists exhibition, and i did a hommage to a 70's artist called
    Yocheved Vinefeld who stitched threads over her own images:\r\n\r\nwww.most.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/3C463066-2A7A-4249-BA17-EE5BB0D94489/0/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%93%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%93.JPG\r\n\r\n(more

    you see, i need some font which is very interesting in typography but (or and)
    also is very geometric, so i can sow it with threads and use it as a font too."
