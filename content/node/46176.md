  mainly interested in the script font, but I wouldn't mind hearing about the sans-serif
  too. Is the sans-serif Univers?"

  body: "It's a little hard to see the details of the R tail, but the proportions
    of the sans look a bit different than either the condensed or ultra condensed
    versions of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/univers/|Univers]]. I know this
    could be massaged graphically, although that offends purists. I also thought Akzidenz
    Grotesk Buch Condensed looked like it could be a good match, based on the sample
    in the old FontBook, but I cannot find it online now.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
