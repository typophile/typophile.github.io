  body: "My understanding is that William Arthur developed some scripts to make its
    products distinctive from those of competitors. If this is in fact the case, I
    would have some doubts that you will find an exact match for T-184.\r\n\r\nYour
    image is of a good size and contains information on the details of the script.
    I have done some editing to pop up this information and rearranged and resized
    it to fit in the small window provided by Typophile for viewing without significant
    scrolling. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScriptWilliamArthurT184Typophile124546e_5470.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if there is another font with similar calligraphic finishing details on
    the strokes and the dots on the _i_.\r\n\r\nAre you aware of any more samples
    of William Arthur T184. More letters would be helpful in choosing a substitute.
    \r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This writing style is derived from the corsiva script developed in Vatican
    in 16th century. Compare the general letterforms to Cancelleresca Corsiva https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/agedage-cancelleresca/
    From the metal type era -- and thus very simplified -- see Hermann Zapf's Zapf
    Chancery http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/zapf-chancery/\r\nFor another very simplified
    -- and rather boring -- version see Monotype Corsiva https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-corsiva/
    Another in this general style Poetica http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/poetica/\r\nPlus
    Felipa, a Google Web Font.\r\nFor more fonts in this genre see http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Corsiva&q=Go
    and follow the links on the ringt hand side under the label \"See more similar
    fonts.\"\r\n\r\nA little more interesting Goteborg  https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/goteborg/
    \r\n\r\nA somewhat livelier substitute,  Laura Worthington's origins,  https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/origins/
    which unfortunately is available only in a distressed/antiqued version.\r\n\r\nI
    do hope another typophile finds a font that better fits the flavor of your sample.\r\n\r\nDon"
