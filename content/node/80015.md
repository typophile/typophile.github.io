    care now at the section on subpixel spacing (<a href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec32\">\xA73.3.2</a>),
    which with yesterday's relatively quiet release of IE9 has suddenly ceased to
    be a pending issue. The first thing I noticed when setting up my IE9 homepage
    to match my Firefox 3.6 page is that the thin verticals of M and N (approx. 14pt
    Constantia, 96dpi) are becoming pale smudges. As Beat notes:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    main drawback of fractional advance widths and fractional pixel positioning is
    the loss of stroke rendering contrast at sufficiently small type sizes and device
    resolutions (<a hre=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec13\">cf
    3.1.3</a>). As we have just seen, it thwarts any intentions to carefully position
    strokes to \u201Coptimize\u201D stroke rendering contrast. Informally put, at
    text sizes on 96 or even 120 DPI screens, text is simply rendered with more \u201Cfringe\u201D
    than \u201Ccore.\u201D</blockquote>\r\n_____\r\n\r\nSo far, the fundamental observation
    is this, from <a href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh1.htm#Sec2\">\xA71.2</a>
    (Beat's emphasis):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Even more math, equations, parenthesis\u2014really!\u2014why
    does this matter? It matters because it shows how rounding or sampling makes font
    rendering non-linear. Once it is non-linear, it is no longer scalable. The two
    concepts linearity and scalability are equivalent here.\r\n\r\n<strong>The startling
    conclusion is that rounding or sampling makes the allegedly scalable font format
    non-scalable!</strong></blockquote>"

    one to consider how something might or should work or be used, rather than proceeding
    on the basis of how it has worked or how it has been used. Beat makes a distinction
    between hinting and 'pixel-popping', and even when one acknowledges a practical
    continuum between these things in \u2018getting the job done\u2019, the distinction
    remains a useful one. What I take away from Beat's Chapter 6 is that we need to
    think about TrueType more as a programming language, which will make it possible
    to move closer on the continuum to Beat's definition of hinting, and away from
    using this potentially very powerful tool as a \u2018technophiliac disguise for
    \u201Cpixel-popping\u201D\u2019.\r\n\r\nHence my comment about FontLab's TrueType
    hinting capabilities, which pretty much do function as a pixel-popping interface,
    and which hence have become increasingly less useful as we move away from bi-level
    rendering. We're now at a place where enthusiastic amateurs are finding that FL
    (auto)hinting can apparently improve the appearance of some glyphs in some fonts
    at some sizes in some environments -- heck, maybe even most glyphs in most fonts
    at most sizes in most environments --, but they're doing so \u2018oblivious to
    the fact that it took the rasterizer a seemingly serendipitous chain of tiny rounding
    errors to produce this particular result\u2019. In other words, they're hinting
    from particular outlines to particular results, rather than generalising hinting
    as a programming strategy that will provide the most flexible set of nested instructions
    and functions, such that varying raster output devices, rendering methods and
    user preferences are able to take most advantage of that hinting.\r\n\r\nThis,
    of course, presumes another point that Beat makes: hinting is (should be) all
    about acting, not reacting. If this is the case -- or becomes the case -- then
    hinting goes from being the cladding on a building that makes it look nice to
    being something like a foundation, something that new rendering methods and options
    for end users can reliably build on top of, and without resorting to the kind
    of \u2018band-aids\u2019 Beat was forced to enact in the Windows rasteriser to
    get existing fonts not to explode in ClearType."

    things have changed since then. At the time, talk at MS was about subpixel positioning
    and y-direction AA in ClearType becoming widely used in Windows Vista. That didn't
    happen, although those features were present in the massively underexposed Windows

    further away. :)\r\n\r\nI think the intervening years have proven David right
    about quantising outline design and spacing, although with the ever more pressing
    caveat that this is a size specific solution, which makes me nervous given the
    widespead use of text zoom on touchscreen devices. Customers want scalable fonts,
    and I don't think we really have a good mechanism to deliver them while also getting
    the kind of quality of text on screen that we want, users deserve and customers
    might just be willing to pay for if only it also scales. Recently, I've been working
    on UI fonts, and the nice thing about the project is that there's a limited range
    of ppem sizes in which the customer is interested (in part because they're presuming
    a particular resolution), so I could quantise the design and spacing to work optimally
    at the most common of these sizes. But UI fonts are exceptional in that they tend
    to be used at static sizes. I still think it makes sense to decide on a target
    size for a design for screen, and to quantise accordingly, but as the text is
    scaled that design and spacing may appear freakish. I'll also point out that a
    project in which a customer is only interested in two ppem sizes is only half
    as nice as a project in which they are only interested in one ppem size.\r\n\r\n"

    with regard to quantising.\r\n\r\nAs I said, recently I've been working on fonts
    that have a prioritised ppem size, so I quantise for that size and then work outwards,
    watching the relationships of verticals and horizontals gradually degrade until,
    at some larger size, they coincidentally coalesce again.\r\n\r\nI've also tried
    the trickier thing, which is to try to position a design within a field of sizes.
    The decisions to be made in this case are complicated, and I've not determined
    even if there are rules of thumb that can be generalised across different types.
    Of course, it doesn't help that none of these projects involve the same writing
    systems.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nRe-reading that old thread -- when did I find the time
    to produce all those screenshots! --, I thought of another thing that has changed
    since 2006. In that thread I was referring to 'contrast' in the sense of figure-ground
    contrast -- what Beat refers to, as in my first quote from his text above, as
    \u2018rendering contrast\u2019 --, but since then, to avoid confusion with contrast
    of stroke thicknesses, I've adopted the term 'stroke density' to refer to that
    desirable quality of text, epitomised in good quality printing, wherein the solid
    (blackness) of a stroke is not affected by the thickness of the stroke. My preference
    for (ASPAA) ClearType over other antialiasing mechanisms has always been based
    on the fact that it does a better job of preserving stroke density (as illustrated
    in numerous places in that old thread). As Beat observes, some of this advantage
    is lost in HSPAA ClearType, when subpixel positioning degrades stroke density
    in verticals (y-direction AA can degrade stroke density in horizontals, too, but
    should be controllable with the gasp table).\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to what I'm
    most looking for in hinting these days (beyond obvious things like y-direction
    alignment control): strategies to maintain a minimum stroke density, to keep the
    not-actually-black strokes as close to black as possible at normal reading distances."

    Scalability is certainly a problem that makes me uneasy when looking at the preliminary

    Limit</em>&rdquo;), seeing how type designers can craft rather legible bitmaps

    a single set of outlines to become progressively more regular as point size and
    device resolution decrease. Since then I have adapted this concept for use with
    anti-aliasing methods and for optimizing stroke rendering contrast ([[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec12|\xA73.1.2]])
    and bi-level pixel patterns ([[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh6.htm#Sec33|\xA76.3.3]]).

    on some fonts that, at specific ppem sizes, are designed for advance widths to
    round to full pixel boundaries, with the intent that the outline edges maintain
    the same relationship to the pixel boundaries, ensuring consistent and appropriate
    stroke density. The trouble is that when these fonts appear in the same line of

    Quantising being a technical practise of 'averaging out', used a lot in digital

    lot of sense when dealing with fonts for screen to adopt such strategies of quantising
    (in David Berlow's post) to better fit stems, bowl edges, terminals etc to the
    digital pixel grid. This minimises the need for 'lots' of hinting instructions.
    With DirectWrite, where the need for comprehensive hinting instructions has been
    lessened it still makes sense to fit the grid as much as possible, for crisper
    rendering and minimising those weird blips at small sizes. It even makes for crisper
    rendering on Quartz.\r\n\r\nre; gasp tables& truetype fonts - with DirectWrite
    coming online now, version 1 tables are essential for optimum rendering on Windows
    IExplorer 9 and Firefox 4. A version 1 gasp table is backward compatible with
    the pre- & GDI cleartype (i.e. a version 1 table will still do ye olde antialias
    & gridfit if it needs to), but a version 0 gasp table is not forward compatible;
    i.e. it wont bring out the best of DirectWrite font rendering. \r\n\r\nps Fontlab

    addressing bi-level rendering only. Learning methods are about as individual as
    people are individual: What works for me may not work for somebody else, and vice-versa.
    If nothing else, Vincent&rsquo;s sample font illustrates how the control program
    (CVT + prep), the font program, and the glyph programs work together (and I doubt
    there is nothing else to be learned).\r\n\r\nLearning methods aside, David&rsquo;s
    description of &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; reminds me of what was referred to me as
    &ldquo;light-weight hinting&rdquo; or &ldquo;substantially y-direction only hinting.&rdquo;
    The fallacy with this approach is that it causes seemingly unpredictable spacing
    issues, as discussed in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec30|\xA73.3.0]]
    (end of paragraph, &lsquo;O&rsquo; rendered in ClearType with &ldquo;y-direction
    only hinting&rdquo;) and [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec21|\xA74.2.1]]
    (end of paragraph, &lsquo;lellellel&rsquo; rendered in ClearType). Likewise, absent
    or inadequate x-direction &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; can cause substantially equal
    stems to render with seemingly unequal sample counts, as illustrated in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh5.htm#Sec1|\xA75.1]]
    (&lsquo;m&rsquo; rendered in ClearType with a darker middle stem).\r\n\r\nMoreover,
    perpetuating the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need x-direction &lsquo;hints&rsquo; in
    ClearType!&rdquo; mantra can only help to never get the &ldquo;hinting&rdquo;
    to match the LCD sub-pixel structure, with all the consequences discussed and
    illustrated in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh5.htm#Sec6|\xA75.6]].
    Whether it is text that is written vertically, or whether you rotate your screen/tablet
    from &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; to &ldquo;portrait,&rdquo; what was the x-direction
    now becomes the y-direction, and vice-versa. Sadly, Windows doesn&rsquo;t handle
    &plusmn;90&deg; rotation correctly because there are no fonts that are &ldquo;hinted&rdquo;
    to match the LCD sub-pixel structure&mdash;or the fonts are not hinted to match
    the LCD sub-pixel structure because Windows doesn&rsquo;t handle &plusmn;90&deg;
    rotation correctly.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I don&rsquo;t see how &ldquo;hinting&rdquo;
    for gray-scaling is another dimension, as David put it. The stems are the same,
    the crossbars are the same, and so is the design contrast between horizontals
    and verticals or uppercase and lowercase. The only difference between gray-scaling
    ([[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh2.htm#Sec1|\xA72.1]]) and y-anti-aliased
    ClearType ([[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh2.htm#Sec3|\xA72.3]]) is
    a different set of oversampling rates, which can be addressed in the pre-program,
    and potentially a different method to &ldquo;sharpen&rdquo; strokes."

    in low resolutions and at small sizes causes spacing issues. y-only-hinting is
    the only rational typographic reaction to CT, not an evangelized solution to the
    tragedy.\r\n\r\nBeat>Quantizing outlines doesn\u2019t make any sense at all except
    to demonstrate,\r\n\r\nTerms: <em>Typeface Design</em> is, (beyond the drawing
    of compatible but dissimilar shapes), assigning dissimilar values to similar letter
    features to compensate for the optical effects caused by feature location, and
    by the combination of features within a glyph.\r\n\r\nThis \"Dequantizing\" is
    a big part of type design; the O is taller than the H because of feature location,
    the cross strokes of the B are lighter than the H's because of feature combination.\r\n\r\n<em>Typographic
    Quantizing</em>, generally is grouping dissimilar values of letter features to
    an identical value for some reason, either in spite of the optical effects, or
    in anticipation of the effects of output. \r\n\r\n<em>Absolute Quantizing</em>
    means the letters are systematically fit to <strong>a grid</strong>, to compensate
    for the effects of low resolution at a particular pixel per em size.\r\n\r\n<em>Relative
    Quantizing</em> means to group some features relative to each other, and to an
    output range of pixels, but not to a grid location or pixel value, maybe because
    the optical effects of the dequantized features are not going to work for the
    output.\r\n\r\nNow from a Y point of view: there are big alignments one almost
    never quantizes, like the difference between upper and lowercase;) Each of these
    alignments has a daughter overshoot/undershoot. And each of these has daughters
    too! for shapes that need more or less shoot than the O e.g.\r\n\r\nWell thank
    Ptah for Y instructions in Windows and heavy rendering on the Mac, but still,
    having the grand-daughter alignments of the H in a text face for the web means
    more hinting for no user benefit. Relatively quantized, the problem goes away.
    \r\n\r\nI have proceeded and demonstrated that quantizing in <em>X direction</em>
    letter design makes lots of happy screen fonts too. Again, this is not my choice
    \u2014 I wanted a world where all fonts could work because all hints could work.
    Apple said absolutely not and fixed it with rendering. MS said \"We'll see\",
    and we have seen a lot. \r\n\r\nAnd John, just noticed his vertical thin stems
    are disappearing in the ClearType collection, 6 years after I told him he could
    not design a font for screen text and print display without x instructions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fonts for screen rasterization, quantizing is very useful for regularizing your

  body: "There are two aspects to this problem.\r\n\r\nAs illustrated in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec32|\xA73.3.2]],
    fractional advance widths and fractional pixel positioning &ldquo;thwarts any
    intentions to carefully position strokes to &lsquo;optimize&rsquo; stroke rendering
    contrast.&rdquo; In other words, even if I prefer the &ldquo;navy core&rdquo;
    over the &ldquo;maroon core,&rdquo; because I may think it yields a higher contrast,
    I don&rsquo;t get to choose this <em>and</em> choose sub-pixel positioning.\r\n\r\nThe
    other aspect is the minimum distance. As mentioned in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec13|\xA74.1.3]],
    &ldquo;To minimize distortions caused by aggressive bi-level constraints, it was
    eventually decided that ClearType rendering should reduce the minimum distance
    criterion to one half of the value specified by the author of the constraints.&rdquo;
    This wasn&rsquo;t my decision, but IIRC decided by majority vote.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a simple and a practical way to overrule this &ldquo;divide-by-two&rdquo; minimum
    distance. Both effectively require doubling the minimum distance. The simple way
    to try out if this works for you is something like this:\r\n\r\nXLink(parent,
    child, cvt, >=2)\r\n\r\nIn the long run this would be very impractical and &ldquo;hard-wired&rdquo;
    for ClearType. Hence, once you&rsquo;re certain that this is worth your while,
    I&rsquo;d try to conditionally set the minimum distance, something like this:\r\n\r\nASM[\"\r\nIF[]
    &ldquo;ClearType and in x-direction&rdquo;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMD[], 128
    /* 2 pixel */\r\nELSE[]\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMD[], 64 /* 1 pixel */\r\nEIF[]\r\n\"]"

    anything at that size, it should obey the instructions. And the instructions in
    your example should be building a tidy O, shorter and narrower, or taller and
    wider, depending on the adjoining sizes. But that wasn't the point.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe
    part of the rasterizer that executes TrueType instructions is called &ldquo;interpreter,&rdquo;
    hence in this context &ldquo;to interpret&rdquo; means &ldquo;to execute&rdquo;
    (or, to use your words, &ldquo;to obey&rdquo;) the instructions. I gather this
    terminology may cause confusion, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s used conventionally
    and actually. I&rsquo;ll try to remember to use &ldquo;to execute&rdquo; henceforth.\r\n\r\nBut,
    returning to the point I am making in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec30|\xA73.3.0]]:
    The fallacy of the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need x-direction &lsquo;hints&rsquo;
    in ClearType!&rdquo; approach is that it causes seemingly unpredictable spacing
    issues. The following example, taken from [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec30|\xA73.3.0]],
    rendered in ClearType, contains <em>no instructions in x-direction whatsoever,</em>
    hence there are no instructions for the rasterizer to execute, to obey, to disobey,
    or to &ldquo;misinterpret.&rdquo; Yet the spacing is off&mdash;off enough that
    even I can see it:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/ArialUCO12pt96DPICTwithoutX.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever,
    <em>with instructions in x-direction</em> I can tackle the proportions, take the
    advance width as a &ldquo;budget,&rdquo; and allocate left and right side-bearing
    spaces in accordance with the design.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/ArialUCO12pt96DPICTwithX.png\">\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m
    sure there are other strategies to allocate side-bearings and black-body-width,
    given the advance width (which I prioritized) and the proportions of the &lsquo;O,&rsquo;
    and I&rsquo;m open to suggestions, but the above is what I get following the aforementioned
    strategy. Notice that all strokes are rounded to the nearest 1/6 of a pixel, CVTs
    are used for all strokes and heights, but there are no deltas involved in the
    process."

    It's a one-party system and they are all Y-men. Thus, the distance between the
    CT quality floor, (no hints), and the CT quality ceiling, (a little Y hinting),
    is a tiny space with no room for anyone to distinguish themselves hintingly. What
    are you gonna do about it now!? :)

    water poured on it :)\r\nThe idea of 'quantising' values in a font design in order
    to aid rasterisation reminds me of the faces Frutiger did for IBM's Selectric
    computer/typewriter. There was a hardware constraint, so the designer worked with
    the constraint to better the output. in the case of the Selectric there was the
    constraint of fixed widths to characters, yet a wish for a more 'typographic'
    fitting of the characters. So Frutiger came up with a set of 6 char widths (including
    their fixed sidebearings) that he resolved by 'quantising' his fonts (he never
    called it 'quantising' !) But he took eg, Univers, and quantised the face down
    to only 6 character widths, with each character fitting into 1 of those 6. \r\n\r\nMy

    aid screen rendering of a font in any way ? Could a similar approach help in hinting
    of a font?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nNot entirely sure I&rsquo;m not trying to answer the
    wrong question. Conceptually, in the illustration below, I have taken the outlines
    of a lc &lsquo;m&rsquo; and quantized them for the purpose of making them easier
    to hint.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/Temp/AriallcmQuantizedOutline12pt96dpi.png\">\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the pixels this gets me at 12 pt and 96 DPI (16 ppem), I find that this makes
    it very easy to hint.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/Temp/AriallcmQuantizedOutline12pt96dpiBW.png\">\r\n\r\nEssentially
    no hinting required. However, if I&rsquo;d rather have 11 pt at 120 DPI (18 ppem),
    this gets me back to square one.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/Temp/AriallcmQuantizedOutline11pt120dpiBW.png\">\r\n\r\nBack
    to hinting.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, if I were to use an integer multiple of
    12 pt, say 24 pt at 96 DPI (32 ppem), the quantized outline would be again very
    easy to hint.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/Temp/AriallcmQuantizedOutline24pt96dpiBW.png\">\r\n\r\nI
    could repeat the above exercise with a lc &lsquo;n,&rsquo; but even allowing for
    a different character width, this would get me substantially the same results.\r\n\r\nThe
    point is that the character shapes on the golf ball type element of the Selectric
    typewriter are analog (even if the advance widths have been quantized to just
    a few), the ribbon that&rsquo;s struck by the type element is analog, and the
    paper that holds the imprint of the ribbon is analog. No raster tragedies, no
    hinting required.\r\n\r\nConversely, the screen is digital. Even the outlines
    that have been quantized as above get re-quantized (rasterized, or sampled), causing
    raster tragedies and requiring hinting.\r\n\r\nI could repeat the above exercise
    with any kind of anti-aliasing, with substantially the same results on the abstraction
    level of samples instead of pixels. But as illustrated in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec0|\xA73.0]],
    the raster tragedies don&rsquo;t go away, they&rsquo;re merely less obvious to
    see."

    Some seem to work ok, though i did them more as a way of stimulating a working

    the grid at specific size intervals, (in your illustration those waypoints are
    12, 24, 48 etc at 96dpi) then surely the points between waypoints would at least
    inherit 'some' of the grid fitted qualities of the waypoints. Seems like a fair
    backbone system for laying out a font design for digital screens. For example,

    amount of extra bleed originates in the sinc filter proposed by MS Research at
    the time, which is the correct kind of anti-aliasing filter. DirectWrite may have
    chosen a box filter, instead, which doesn&rsquo;t get you that extra bleed, at
    the potential expense of being less smooth in almost-horizontal glyph parts. This
    is the same kind of filter that is used in standard gray-scaling as well.\r\n\r\nBut
    that&rsquo;s beside the point. Have a look at the 4th E in your size ramp (12
    pt at 96 DPI). Its stem is a combination of cobalt blue and tawny orange. This
    combination yields a blurry mess with a <strong><em>WCAG 2.0 Contrast Ratio of
    1.37</em></strong> only. You can look at this in two ways: You have a 2-pixel
    wide blurry stem of vibrating colors, or you have something blueish that hardly

    in high stroke density and consistent glyph rendering at that size when the font
    is used in the first half of a line of text, but then if a different font is used
    to insert even a single glyph in the middle of the line, the same Arabic font

  body: "Quoting John: &ldquo;not sure that it is fair to cite the WCAG recommendations
    re. contrast with regard to one vertical stroke that, as the same englargement
    shows, is atypical&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFair or not&mdash;I&rsquo;ll leave that judgment
    to this thread&rsquo;s readers. Here&rsquo;s how I got there: For the sake of
    the example/argument, we&rsquo;re trying to render nominally black text against
    a white background. With the combination of ClearType, sub-pixel positioning,
    and the actual pixel fraction on which an individual character/stem ends up, at
    text sizes and common display resolutions, I get all kinds of colors on these
    stems, but few if any black pixels.\r\n\r\nAs a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromacy|dichromat]]
    these colors don&rsquo;t mean all that much to me, but I do notice that some stems
    look sharper than others. With gray-scaling (box-filter) it seems fairly easy
    to see what combination of fractional stem position and width makes stems look
    fuzzy, and which ones render black pixels as black. With the colors it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;certainly
    not for me&mdash;and hence the WCAG contrast ratio used in the process.\r\n\r\nThe
    contrast ratio is an entity I can see: in the &ldquo;Schillerstein&rdquo; example
    referenced above, the various ClearTyped and sub-pixel positioned &lsquo;i&rsquo;
    and &lsquo;l&rsquo; seem to render in some &ldquo;malibu blue&rdquo; against &ldquo;peach
    orange&rdquo; which means next to nothing to me, but I can see it is blurry, and
    the WCAG puts a number on that blur, telling me I&rsquo;m looking at something
    that&rsquo;s close to gray on gray.\r\n\r\nThe 2-pixel wide stem referenced earlier
    seems to render in a combination of &ldquo;cobalt blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;tawny
    orange&rdquo; which again means next to nothing to me, but the WCAG metric puts
    a number on it, telling me how little they contrast from each other. In other
    words, I am looking at a 2-pixel wide stem in gray where the actual/natural stem
    width is about 1 1/3 pixel. The colors with little contrast blur the 1 1/3 pixel
    to what looks like 2 pixels.\r\n\r\nI picked a single stem as an example to avoid
    bothering this thread&rsquo;s readers with too many numbers. Numbers seems to
    be discouraged&mdash;unfortunately so. If someone tells me it&rsquo;s hot outside,
    this means little to me, because what&rsquo;s hot for them may mean a furnace
    to me or a very pleasant Sunday afternoon, and vice-versa. Tell me it&rsquo;s
    25&deg;C/77&deg;F and I can decide on my own.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if someone tells
    me this text looks blurry or works just fine, this means little, because it doesn&rsquo;t
    put an objective number on the blur or contrast. If any of you know of a better
    method to determine blur or contrast, I&rsquo;d love to hear. For instance, in
    David&rsquo;s sample, I could count the number of black pixels on a stem and would
    find that there are about none, but it still looks more contrasty. The WCAG metric
    seems to give me a more useful criterion.\r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t
    have a good explanation what makes &ldquo;David&rsquo;s illustration [...] to
    both have higher stroke density and yet to look fuzzier than Mike&rsquo;s. What
    is it that makes it fuzzier to your visual system? If the Apple rasterizer executed
    instructions, maybe David could &lsquo;put&rsquo; the gray at the top on the inside,
    instead? Or maybe your visual system picks up on black sub-pixels more easily?\r\n\r\nThere
    are a number of &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; to &ldquo;boost&rdquo; stroke density. Deliberate
    gamma under-correction comes to mind (choose the darkest sample in the ClearType
    tuner, or similar), along with various mathematical formulae I got to experiment
    with. If anyone knows what&rsquo;s Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;trick&rdquo; and is in
    a position to tell, I&rsquo;d love to know.\r\n\r\nIt all has to work together:
    Hinting (or outline quantizing in the absence of hinting), rasterizer, gamma,
    &hellip;, and&mdash;importantly&mdash;the end-user's visual system. If, like David,
    someone knows what they&rsquo;re doing, &ldquo;it is [easy] to manipulate opinion
    if you want to cherry pick arguments about font rendering.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
    why I try to communicate objective criteria and refer to their sources, rather
    than looking at type and making subjective determinations. For, when it comes
    right down to it, I won&rsquo;t accept &ldquo;hand waving&rdquo; or the statement
    that &ldquo;some Y-men said so&hellip;&rdquo; for a fact."

  body: "Beat: \u201C<cite>[...] a blurry mess with a <strong>WCAG 2.0 Contrast Ratio
    of 1.37</strong> only.</cite>\u201D\r\nI agree that those CT stems are blurry
    & have lower contrast but I think the methodology for calculating contrast ratio
    is incorrect and gives much lower values than they really are.\r\n\r\nIn this
    thread, you used the blue and red color from the same stem to calculate the contrast
    ratio. So the calculated contrast is the inner contrast of the stem, which is
    not very useful. But what is the contrast ratio between background (white in this
    examples) and the stem? Something different and higher.\r\n\r\nUsing colors from
    the stems as a background does make sense when they are actually a background,
    like in \u201C<a title=\"6.1.2 Color Fringes\" href=\"http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh6.htm#Sec12\">Schillerstein</a>\u201D
    example in the \u201Cill\u201D letters. But even here something bothers me, the
    images which are supposed to have the same contrast ratio look like they have
    much worse contrast than original.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the contrast ratio
    is calculated for \u201Cill\u201D letters and then applied for the whole word,
    although some stems are on white background (which means higher contrast) and
    there are also perfectly black pixels for horizontal features which have a very
    high contrast.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that this method completely ignores the
    subpixel effects heavily used by ClearType. The Schillerstein image could be viewed
    on a rotated LCD screen, or on B-R-G screen making the hard coded rendering a
    mess, yet the proposed contrast ratio is exactly the same in all circumstances.\r\n\r\nFurthermore
    I think the subpixel effect is also a variable, depending on viewing distance,
    DPI, user settings... When looking closely I see more color fringing and less
    contrast but if the distance is great the colors are almost gone and contrast
    seems higher. So: When looking very closely (or on a magnified image) the calculated
    contrast ratio in \u201Cill\u201D is correct. With the higher DPI/distance it\u2019s
    harder to perceive actual colors, subpixel rendering takes effect and the contrast
    ratio is not the same any more. This is also perhaps a reason why there is no
    definite answer for how much does CT increase resolution.\r\n\r\nI am not sure
    how to properly calculate contrast for antialiased type. First thought: with grayscale
    antialiasing it could be that you have to calculate the average gray in the stem
    and then use this value as a type color. And similar with subpixel AA, only using
    the luminance of each subpixel instead of the whole subpixels. But the correct
    method is probably more complicated and includes the fact that one very bright
    color in the dark stem contributes only very little to the lowering of the contrast.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the blurriness, if we define it mathematically like some sort of filter (but exactly
    how?), and the contrast ratio are independent. I can imagine glyphs with two different
    blurry levels but with same contrast ratio, and the other way around, glyphs with
    two different contrast ratios but the same blurriness.\r\n\r\nIf you think that
    CT Schillerstein example is very bad, well, it gets even worse in terms of contrast.
    DirectWrite has much less prominent colors by default setting. Color fringing

  body: "Beat, I'm going to avoid talking in terms of contrast, because I think what
    is really at issue is what I call stroke density. Contrast is a problematic term
    because it has a different common meaning in typography: stroke weight modulation,
    i.e. contrast between thick and thin strokes <em>normally of the same stroke density.</em>
    I also think by talking about (figure-ground) contrast we are talking about the
    symptom rather than the cause: if you have good stroke density, you can have whatever
    contrast you like, i.e. you can set light grey text on a dark grey background
    if that is what you want to do, and the structure of the letters will remain intact
    even if the contrast is not ideal for reading, which is not the case if stroke
    density is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe paradigm of stroke density is black ink, which
    is equally black on the page whether the stroke is a main stem or a hairline.
    This is not only the paradigm of typographic printing, but of the much longer,
    global manuscript tradition. I do not know of a single writing system that did
    not favour media that produced strong and consistent strong density. Even when
    such media were not available, people tried to get as close as they could with
    what was at hand. There is no writing system I am aware of that sought to exploit
    shading as a feature for quotidian text production and reading. So why are we
    even contemplating screen rendering mechanisms that rely of fuzzy shading to render
    letter shapes? Primarily, I think, to increase individual typeface verisimiltude,
    i.e. to make fonts on screen look more like identifiable individuated designs
    and less like generic bitmaps. Part of that involves something that I consider
    potentially beneficial to reading: filling in the corners between pixels so that
    curved strokes look like continuous strokes and not like disjointed sequences
    of straight stems and individual bricks. I say \u2018potentially\u2019 beneficial
    to reading because I think their value has to be measured against the overall
    stroke density of letters and against the definition of the figure-ground interaction
    (sharpness or blur).\r\n\r\nWhich brings me round to \u2018Apple\u2019s \u201Ctrick\u201D\u2019
    as you refer to it. There is a direct correlation in Apple rendering between stroke
    density and blur or fuzz: the stronger the stroke density you want, the greater
    fringe blur you have to put up with; conversely, the sharper the edge definition
    you want, the lower consistency in stroke density you have to put up with. For
    me, this is a lose-lose proposition, because I can't put up with either, and I
    do not believe that verisimilitude to a single unhinted set of outline across
    an open ended range of sizes is the right goal. TTF hinting enabled us to to tailor
    designs to specific device sizes, in effect implementing a form of optimised scaling
    from a single outline set. If hinting is taken away, we have no option but to
    create the individual optimised outlines for each size, as David did with Franky,
    <em>because there is no other way to optimise for device sizes.</em>"

    font rendering is that it touches on a broad spectrum of topics which are not
    equally appealing to everyone, yet all the pieces of the puzzle have to somehow
    fit together for the end result.\r\n\r\nI sense that some of this thread&rsquo;s
    readers seem to have some kind of aversion for numbers, but I don&rsquo;t know
    why this could be. Most of the math is mere arithmetic, adding and subtracting
    pixels and fractions of pixels, much like adding up sales and expenses when running
    a font business. Beyond that I&rsquo;ve tried to accompany the math with a description
    in plain English (with the exception of \xA74.0.3)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to hinting
    in TrueType, the barrier may be TrueType itself. It takes a combination of computer
    geometry and programming in an obscure assembly language called TrueType, and
    a good deal of engineering to cater for the various font rendering methods and

  body: "@Miha: The reason I used the blue and red color seemingly belonging to the
    same stem is because that&rsquo;s how stems are rendered when positioned approximately
    halfway between pixel boundaries. We are at the limit of what can be resolved
    by pixels. There is no &ldquo;room&rdquo; for white in-between. Put another way,
    if I render &lsquo;ill&rsquo; in bi-level, with all stems positioned on pixel
    boundaries, using blue pixels against a red background, I get the same set of
    pixels as when I render &lsquo;ill&rsquo; in sub-pixel positioned ClearType, nominally
    in black against a white background.\r\n\r\nThe numbers for &ldquo;peach orange&rdquo;
    (#FFD093) and &ldquo;malibu blue&rdquo; (#69B5E9) on white are 1.43:1 and 2.24:1.
    When the sub-pixel sequence is reversed (ie text rendered for a BGR screen is
    viewed on an RGB screen), the numbers can change, since red, green, and blue make
    weighted contributions. For RGB rendering, blue (#69B5E9) on orange (#FFD093)
    yields 1.57:1, while BGR rendering #E9B569 on #93D0FF yields 1.13:1.\r\n\r\nSure,
    the contrast isn&rsquo;t all the same for the rest of the sample word; what I
    tried to show is what it would look like if the entire word were rendered the
    same way. If only part of the word is rendered with low contrast or high blur,
    it&rsquo;s simply harder to see what this may do to the process of [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx|word
    recognition]].\r\n\r\nAlso agree that we should separate the concepts of blur
    and rendering contrast (or stroke density), and that an appropriate mathematical
    model of blur would involve some kind of a filter. In turn, this gets us into
    Fourier transforms, convolutions, and what not college level math&mdash;a direction
    I was trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nWhat we can <em>see</em> without math is the number
    of black [sub-]pixels (the black core), and the number of [sub-]pixels it takes
    to &ldquo;ramp-up&rdquo; from the white background to the black core (the fringe).
    For the purposely chosen Schillerstein example, there is simply much more core
    than fringe, avoiding to say, all fringe, smudging the distinction between contrast
    and blur.\r\n\r\nHow to determine this in a simple way that can be explained to
    a wide audience? For instance, in that 4th E I picked apart from Mike&rsquo;s
    size ramp, the outline would have the stem 1 1/3 px wide (4 sub-pixels), it is
    rendered with 2 px (6 sub-pixels), yet only 2 sub-pixels are solid black. We could
    define an &ldquo;aperture ratio&rdquo; relating the 2 solid black pixels to the
    total of 6 sub-pixels involved. For larger type sizes or higher dpi, this aperture
    ratio would increase, but without filter that models the contributions of the
    fringe sub-pixels I&rsquo;d hesitate to put a number on it."

    not enough. And TT instructions are not that obscure.\r\n\r\nSince you mention
    \"following Apple's example\" \u2013 perhaps the first thing to do is pointing
    out that there are two fundamentally different approaches to rasterization, i.e.
    two different & mutually exclusive rasterization ideals or goals:\r\n\r\n<em>Goal
    1) Rasterizing true to the device grid.</em> Method: pre-rasterization grid-fitted
    scaling. (Microsoft, Adobe.)\r\n<em>Goal 2) Rasterizing true to design.</em> Method:
    linear scaling and modulated rasterization. (Apple, Karow.)\r\n\r\nBoth of them
    are legitimate goals/ideals, yet: From a goal 1) perspective, asking for methods
    originating from goal 2) can only be perceived as compromising goal 1). And from
    a goal 2) perspective, asking for methods pertaining to goal 1), like grid-fitting,
    even if a little bit, can only be perceived as compromising goal 2). Now there
    are two things that bother me about both Raster Tragedy and this subsequent discussion.
    One is the obvious attempt to reduce questions of goals/ideals to questions of
    methods, technical questions. Dealing with the latter, however, is pointless as
    long as one is not clear about the former. The other is that that the goal 1)
    approach is presented as rasterization-as-such and ideal rasterization in one
    when it is but one specific approach to rasterization among others.\r\n\r\nYou
    and John are asking for more options. Yet, noticeable in Raster Tragedy and even
    more evident here, the problem is not too few options but too many and on too
    many levels. You mention catering \"for the various font rendering methods and
    end-user preferences\". This is the source of problems, Microsoft Windows's problems
    actually, which you present in Raster Tragedy. These problems are self-made problems.
    And the solution is not adding more options but reducing options. Allow a font
    to clearly express whether it expects goal 1) rasterization (b/w or Standard or
    ClearType smoothing) or goal 2) rasterization which then is binding \u2013 regardless
    of applications' or, worse, end users' preferences. (This is not about goal 1)
    vs goal 2) but about failed infrastructure design.)\r\n\r\nType designers' expectations.
    I am certain that most type designers with a print background design type with
    a goal 2) perspective in mind and (a misunderstanding) consider 'hinting' as,
    well, some additional data needed to please Windows's rasterizers. Most designers
    just want to design type, not program TT instructions. Like designers just want
    to design books, not program PostScript. Then, economy of input vs output. Microsoft's
    goal 1) approach is highly demanding as to the required input: production work,
    amount of data produced, bothering users with options. Apple's goal 2) approach
    isn't. Feeding Microsoft's goal 1) approach rasterizers with the same input as
    Apple's goal 2) approach rasterizers gets me rather poor results. There are other
    factors that render a technical solution & its methods (in turn based on one or
    the other goal) practicable. In the real world there are limitations on time and
    budget. These do not necessarily speak against goal 1) rasterization as such but
    against current methods to achieve it. In so far it were nice if Microsoft would
    acknowledge the real world and offer, as an alternative, better goal 2) rasterization
    too \u2013 not for all fonts, but for those that ask for it (see the preceding
    paragraph)."

    and hence we have to find workarounds. Workarounds represent compromises of some
    sort, and they don&rsquo;t work equally well for every end-user and in every application.
    For instance, in a print preview scenario I may prefer a rendition that is closest
    to the outlines and the page color I&rsquo;m about to get from the printed page,
    while in an online reading scenario I may prefer the highest stroke density or
    rendering contrast. \r\n\r\nThese are some of the options I may want to have,
    others may want other options, more options, or fewer options, just so long as
    their preferred method is among the options. Some people seem to get fits with
    the slightest hint of a color fringe, some cannot use any anti-aliasing at all
    because this disables their screen readers, at which point the most typographically
    correct page color and the truest-to-the-outline rendition become an accessibility
    obstacle.\r\n\r\nWhether having options is the source of any problems Microsoft
    may have, or an ansatz for making typographic peace and provide for accessibility,
    what this engineer sees is a number of problems and hence he is looking for solutions.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Most
    designers just want to design type, not program TT instructions.&rdquo; Sure!
    Most musicians just want to make music, not repair their violins, tune their pianos,
    or record their demo tapes. They hire luthiers, piano tuners, or recording engineers
    to do the job.\r\n\r\nWith a little bit of homework about acoustics, microphone
    placement, and recording devices, they <em>can</em> record their own demo tapes,
    simply because the resolution of these devices has become high enough that dealing
    with &ldquo;digital&rdquo; has become a non-issue.\r\n\r\nNot the same with fonts:
    We still have to deal with &ldquo;digital&rdquo; and with tools that bridge that
    gap, or try to bridge that gap. I won&rsquo;t blame anyone for not wanting to
    program TT instructions&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; it either.

    positioning whether appropriate or not, and, yes, without access to variations
    whether appropriate or not -- force compromises too far for many fonts. Mere readability
    can always be addressed by using a different font, but then readability can be
    addressed by always using Georgia and Verdana everywhere. Typography can't be
    addressed in that way: it needs to admit of variety and that means being able
    to render individual fonts in the way best suited to those particular fonts. And

    for, i.e. with optical adjustments and not quantizing. \r\n\r\nIn general, I'm
    not at all worried about type quality on mobile devices. If it's a smart device
    developer, the resolution should simply disappear to the user. And for the most
    part, when the resolution disappears to the user, the font issues do to. \r\n\r\nJ.H.>

    worse before Apple returned to the TT spec a few months ago and allows overlapping

    1.57:1</cite>\u201D\r\n\r\nThere is the exact same color of the whole pixel and
    the same contrast of the whole pixel for this combination on <em>both</em> RGB
    and BGR screens. Your calculations include only whole pixels, but doesn\u2019t
    include the positive subpixel effect which is not only lost but made worse on
    BGR screen.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of single \u201Cstems\u201D, one column
    has reversed colors. Using only whole pixel colors one would calculate the same
    contrast for both combinations in a row. But one column is always noticably worse.
    I think that the order of subpixels also effects the contrast ratio.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-5_5284.png]\r\n\r\nI
    think numbers are apropriate but along with a visual representation of blurriness
    and contrast. First, I tried to illustrate the relation between them eliminating
    all other variables although weight is also increasing (it\u2019s far from perfect,
    specially middle column):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asdf_6298.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    defined mathematically, blurriness could be expressed as absolute or relative
    (when depending on dpi and stem size). Thinking a little more there are different
    levels of blurrines even with the same filter &ndash; blurriness also depends
    on the strenght of colors (which is a user setting in CT). Which means that correct
    mathematical description includes two numbers, which becomes more unintuitive
    &hellip; probably. So I made greyscaled images, magnified three times. Each subpixel
    is represented as a grey pixel with the matching lightness as defined in Lab color
    space (simply desaturating is less accurate).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5864.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_6422.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-14_5108.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-7_4212.png]\r\n\r\nThe

    were compared <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/80015#comment-458181\">here<a>.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I am interested in is what does it all mean when classified through legibility
    and how well is the design of a typeface preserved. This are two different goals,
    and such black & white distinction can be useful, but I can see so much possibilites
    in between &hellip; somehow similar to text typeface design for print where there
    are many levels of how legible yet different a typeface is. Some designers choose
    to make optical sizes or grades which is a high level of control. With current
    rasterisers it\u2019s like choosing one option for everything, even if I imagine
    the limits of resolution.\r\n\r\nThe negative effects of blurriness and reduced
    stroke density can be seen in very small sizes. What I am wondering is what are
    the positive sides? If we see the blurriness through the lens of how well are
    stems fitted to the grid, it is bad. But the goal of gridfitting is having high
    legibility which is primarily achieved through letter forms with high stroke density
    and sharpness. On the other hand this makes glyphs more similar and makes spacing
    worse &ndash; the problem is in definition what is the most appropriate for each
    size and to what extend. This two properties are directly connected to reduced
    legibility, and the criterion of how much are glyphs similar to their true design
    wasn\u2019t included.\r\n\r\nJohn: \u201C<cite>In effect, the white space between

    Perhaps you can mathematically prove that this order is related to reading direction,
    and then we'll be finished with this issue of low resolution ideals in type, and
    some other screen readability issues, for all time:)\r\n\r\n"

    (&ldquo;[&hellip;] text rendered for a BGR screen is viewed on an RGB screen&rdquo;
    [&hellip;]).\r\n\r\nBut you&rsquo;re missing the point of the &lsquo;ill&rsquo;
    example: <em>We are at the limit of what can be resolved by pixels.</em> Whatever
    you see rendered is a compromise. And debating the relative merits of one&rsquo;s
    favorite compromises is supremely futile.\r\n\r\nOne of the main points I&rsquo;m
    making in the Raster Tragedy Revisited is this: &ldquo;Hinting&rdquo; is not about
    deltaing pixels nor about touching up undesirable color fringes. At the limit
    of what pixels can resolve, &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; in TT is programming strategies
    that enable a spectrum of favorite compromises.\r\n\r\nThis <em>is possible</em>,
    even with the Windows rasterizer that I had to compromise for the sake of shoehorning
    existing fonts with their notion of &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; into ClearType duty.
    This <em>is only partly possible</em> if the application forces sub-pixel positioning
    at the resolution limit. This <em>is not possible at all</em> if the operating
    system ignores all instructions  at the resolution limit.\r\n\r\nWhat I don&rsquo;t
    know is <em>why</em> an app or OS would do this:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t they
    know the resolution limit?</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t they know the diversity of
    people&rsquo;s tastes and needs w.r.t. accessibility?</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t
    they know &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; in TT is programming, not pixel-popping?</li>\r\n<li>Or
    are they on a totalitarian holy font crusade?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWithout genuine
    answers to any and all of the above I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll continue to move
    in circles."

    though we're beyond said limit in practice. The only safety for \"single stroke\"
    glyphs on Windows, is to design them as wide as possible, without of course making
    it obvious. You see people doing something like this in font design, though obviously,
    when they add serifs to single stroke glyphs that would normally be serifless.
    Using some-serifing from the start of a design can work, but stylistic bastardization
    can be the result otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line, is that hints, CT, and sub-pixel
    positioning, on Windows, do nothing much to help this ill thing in many sans,
    at the bottom of the size spectrum."
