body: hey. i posted this in another forum on typophile, and it was recommended i post
  here, so here. <BR>this is an identity for a music venue called the Eaves that it
  is an attic like space with slanted ceilings. it will be mostly for experimental/independent
  music...  the main colors will be brown and blue, although exact choices are undecided.
  The type will be displayed on posters, handbills, a backlit sign and maybe a wood
  cut sign.  <BR>on the advice of my last posting, i had made the v more pointed on
  the bottom, and moved the THE around a bit. &#40;thanks sally&#41;. <BR>oh and before
  i forget to say - the main type is LHF becker monogram english, although its pretty
  modified at this point - especially the E. the THE is charlemagne. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39788.gif"

  body: To improve legibility you have to separate &#39;a&#39; and &#39;v&#39;. I
    like the first arrangement better than the second. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S

  body: Yes. Perhaps you can keep the lig at the base of the a-v, but I agree with
    Soren that there needs to be some space between them. I would create it by moving
    them apart just a little, then disconnecting the them at the top. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

    <BR> <BR>What do you think about the placement of &#34;the&#34;?

  body: I have &#34;0&#34; knowledge of this style of typography however I do sense
    the word &#34;the&#34; needs to be is a different font. Possible san serif? Right
    now &#34;the&#34; just seems way to French.

  body: 'thanks for all the feedback. here are the changes made: <BR> <BR>on the v,
    after making it more pointed on the bottom, the line above that wasn&#39;t quite
    right.. i reckon it needed to be more like a calligraphic brush stroke - so the
    line width wouldn&#39;t vary in a space like that. uuh.. that may or not make
    sense, but trust me, the line widths are more regular on the v. so thats the changes
    on the top one. <BR> <BR>for the bottom one i changes the a-v realtionship. i
    dunno how i feel about. im not sure i executed it correctly.. thoughts?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39896.gif"

  body: I like the changes to the bottom one more. All of the letters only connect
    with eachother in one area and to me the v&#39;s looses a bit of legibility when
    attached to the a in two spots so I would keep going with that one.  <BR> <BR>Just
    looking back at the other post that Sally linked up. I liked the placement of
    the &#34;the&#34; when it was above the a and the v. It to me just seemed more
    of a part of the logo that way. Except I would make it a little bit smaller then
    what you had it at in the last post and bring it closer to the eaves type.

  body: 'I may be the only one...but <BR> <BR>Could you give the top of the UC E a
    hard angle, and refine the loop? It seems the other letters do well going from
    hard edge to curly, whereas the UC cant make up its mind at time whether to be
    hard or loopy. <BR> <BR>The &#34;aves&#34; is kickass though. <BR> <BR>Andrew '

  body: ' <BR>something about the v still does not seem quite right . . . maybe the
    upper left serif type thing &#40;sorry, i don&#39;t know fontography lingo!&#41;
    could imitate the curve of the &#34;a&#34; -- does that make sense? Having it
    the way it is still creates an akward space between the a and the v, although
    opening it that bit did help. <BR> <BR>THE still seems to be floating, it doesn&#39;t
    seem like it is part of the logo.'

  body: Maybe a direction to try that would create a hard edge above the &#34;E&#34;,
    like Andrew suggested, and a solution for &#34;THE&#34;, addressing Sally&#39;s
    concern, could look something like this &#40;with much refinement

  body: I really like the last suggestion andrew just made because it solidifies the
    roofline into the design which will help capture the whole idea - perhaps on the
    side that is falling away you can use a similar geometry to show a longer falling
    away starting with the curly of the v that might also help attack some of the
    v issues people have noted. &#40;boy is that ever clear as mud&#41;
