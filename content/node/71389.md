  body: "Flare Gothic is a \"nickname\" for [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/flange-bq/bold/|Flange]]
    AFAIK. (Not an illegal one though, URW had the rights to sell certain fonts but
    not under their original name.)\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Flange (or Flare Gothic) is only similar: see the middle \u2018E\u2019 and
    \u2018F\u2019 bar, the top of the \u2018T\u2019 \u2026 Also, the flare serifs
    in the sample seem to be angled/abrupt."
