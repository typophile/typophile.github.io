  and typography isn't my forte, so if you could bear with me on my ignorance it would
  be appreciated. \r\n\r\nI'm working on a system that generates pdf reports, and
  I'm trying to get it setup to properly embed the fonts in the pdf. I'm good on the
  technical side, but I'm a bit confused trying to figure out what fonts I'm actually
  looking for. The standard font for reports in our company is Helvetica, but I'm
  finding it quite difficult to find a font actually called \"Helvetica\". Is there
  no such thing as just \"Helvetica\"? I'm specifically looking for these three fonts:
  Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica-Oblique, which are the ones that are needed
  by the PDF. \r\nAgain, please excuse my ignorance as I don't claim to know anything
  about typography, but any help is appreciated."

    is a technical issue ;-)\r\nThe just Helvetica fonts you are looking for are system
    fonts on Apple Macintosh whose purpose is solely to display things like software
    menues. If your company\u2019s corporate typeface is Helvetica you should look
    for fonts called \u203ANeue Helvetica\u2039 (Roman, Bold, Italic). Those are needed
    to prepare printable documents."

  body: "So is the font name \"Helvetica\" specific to Apple computers? Basically
    I just need to know whether normal helvetica is still called just helvetica or
    does it have a different name? The closest I've been able to find is Helvetica
    LT Std Roman. Is this the same thing, or an updated version? \r\nI can change
    the font name that the PDFs are generated with so it's not an issue if the name
    is not just Helvetica, I just want to make sure I'm getting the right font. "

      name that describes the typeface design. Like \u201CSebring\u201D describes
      a car model. But not all Sebrings are the same because they are all called this
      way. There were versions of that model produced at different times, and you
      could have it with different extras if you wish. \r\nIt\u2019s the same with
      such fonts. There are old PostScript versions of Helvetica still floating around
      from the 1980s and 1990s and then there are \u201Cre-mastered\u201D OpenType
      versions with the old name or the new name Helvetica Neue with new character
      designs and font styles. And some versions come with a basic character set,
      some with a larger character set. Some are OTF, some are TTF. It all depends.
      If you were told to use Helvetica, follow the trail back to the source where
      this specification comes from. They will know which Helvetica to use and they
      should also know about how this font was licensed and can be used. "

    is, but that typeface is around since the 1950s and exists in dozens of versions
    \u2014 both regarding the actual design as well as the font formats. So you might
    want to check with the design department (or whoever is responsible for the corporate
    design) to see which version you should use and you might also check the licensing
    for those fonts. There might be special requirements for embedding, server use
    and things like that. "

  body: "Sorry, I was misled by J. Weltin's post which mentions the Mac. The original
    message mentions nothing about the operating system on which the report generator
    is installed. The message of interest above mentions that you can send to a postscript
    printer a postscript file that does not contain Helvetica embedded and the printer
    should be able to render it. There is an example of such a PostScript input in
    https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf. \r\n<PRE>\r\n/Helvetica

    however does not answer the initial question. If you need to embed, you need to
    know the file format your generator takes as input and the Helvetica your company
    has licensed, as was mentioned above. On the other hand, there are also free fonts
    that can easily replace Helvetica if you are not fussy about your outputs."
