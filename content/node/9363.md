body: I&#39;m looking for the font used for the Chicken Soup for the Soul titling.
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65814.gif" alt=""> <BR>The
  C is, of course, identical to the C in the Campbell&#39;s Soup logo, and I&#39;ve
  found that FlashFonts&#39; Casey Classic is pretty close, but not quite the same.
  <BR> <BR>Any further guesses?

  body: I think they just made it up. Neither the C or the S&#39;s are very well drawn,
    and the S&#39;s don&#39;t really fit the Campbell&#39;s logo script idiom. <BR>
    <BR>The other font in the lowercase is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/roman/testdrive.html?s=for+the&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Palatino</a>.

  body: It would be nice if I could find a font with that UC S, but that&#39;s a close
    enough ID for me. <BR> <BR>Thanks guys.
