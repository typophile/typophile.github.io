  body: The main Gaelic face looks like modified Uncial. <BR> <BR>Maybe something
    like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bernhard-schoenschrift-ef/bernhard-schoenschrift-light/testdrive.html?s=Restaurant+%26+Bar&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Bernhard</a> for that script &#40;though it gets harder to discern
    as we move down the sample&#41;.. <BR> <BR>..and though the 3rd sample is almost
    totally intelligible, it almost looks like Helvetica with serifs?  Strange, but
    should get you started.

    target="_blank">Uncial</a>, or that modified.

  body: I think Ryan is right about the third line being Helvetica, but I think the
    &#34;serifs&#34; are just an artifact of the fax distortion.
