body: Has anyone come across any type rendering oddities in Photoshop 7 for Windows?
  In the sample below, a font provided in a corp id manual rendered very oddly depending
  on the type size - it appears the turning point &#40;pardon the pun&#41; is 101,
  at which point it develops odd outlines etc.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/62748.gif"
  alt="type sample"> <BR> <BR>The 3rd sample provided to show whats happening up close.
  <BR> <BR>Has anyone come across this, or know of a way within Photoshop to get around
  it? &#40;I&#39;d rather not have to set type in Freehand and bring it across as
  the extra accuracy isn&#39;t entirely necessary for screen-based work, before someone
  points this out <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: Maybe it&#39;s some really fancy hinting? <BR>I know that FontBureau has a
    font that uses hinting to drop out finer features &#40;like parts of a floriated
    background&#41; the smaller the size. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I&#39;ve had the same problem happen to me, David - especially at 99%. I always
    figured it had something to with hinting &#40;as Hrant pointed out&#41; or something
    to do with bitmap vs. vector. If you find out what the reason is, do share it!

    see if anything turns up.

    be interested in running some tests. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Hi Thomas. <BR> <BR>My pleasure. The font came to me in a style guide from
    a client and is freebie called Goose, designed by David Buck in 1999 and released
    via Chank. Well, thats what the readme said, but there&#39;s no sign of it at
    either Chank or SparkyType. Which is a bit odd. <BR> <BR>The version is &#34;1999;
    1.0, intial release&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m off home for the night, Thomas, so if
    you want to get in contact with me about this for today, please email me at david[at]lowresolution.co.uk

    <BR>And looking at your rightmost zoom more carefully, it can&#39;t really be
    intentional. <BR> <BR>hhp'
