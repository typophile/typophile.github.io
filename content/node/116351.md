    body: Wow, you totally got me on that one. TH is way too loose ? I mean if thats
      the case the whole thing would be too loose I'm thinking. So you're saying besides
      what you mentioned everything else was fine?

  body: "TH *is* way loose.\r\nIt may help to focus on three letters at a time: If
    you look at THE you should see that there\u2019s way more space between TH than
    HE."

    body: I see what you mean with TH. Im trying to get the same space between HE
      or the rest of them.

  body: I think that its more a matter of letterforms than kerning. The letters in
    ATHE are more complex than the DRAL. Maybe if the H was a bit simpler (not so
    many thin lines) and there was some kind of tail at the L like the first A? Or
    some other change that will "distribute" the decorative elements more evenly?

    body: In the original sketch there was a small flourish for the L but I removed
      that since got too much. But that's something to reconsider I guess

  body: "Much worse, to my eyes. I think everybody suggested to tighten (not to loosen)
    \u2018TH\u2019 and \u2018DR\u2019. If you want everything to be as loose as \u2018TH\u2019,
    you will need to loosen up all other combinations considerably."

      name: laasr
    body: yes I'm trying to loosen it up more. Previously TH was tighter than HE.
      Based on what you're saying now, if I loosen up the rest based on TH then we're
      going back to step1. Confusing.

  body: "Note that the idea generally is not primarily to equalize the linear distance
    (how close the rightmost bit of one letter is to the left side of the next) but
    rather the <em>area</em> between the letters... As the T already has a lot of
    \u201Cair\u201D\_under its uh, roof, it needs less distance to the letters around
    it than, say, an H would. That\u2019s why the TH was in fact too loose in the
    beginning even though the linear distance between these letters was not much.
    Hope this makes sense."
