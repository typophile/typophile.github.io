    Rilke che adoro : <BR> <BR>&#34;For verses are not as people imagine, <BR>simply
    feelings...they are experiences. <BR>For the sake of a single verse, one must
    see <BR>many cities, men and things, one must know <BR>the animals, one must feel
    how the birds fly  <BR>and know the gesture with which little  <BR>flowers open
    in the morning.&#34; <BR> <BR>AS'
