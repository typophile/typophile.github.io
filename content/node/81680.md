  Boot Sale or Village Fayre, say for a post by the side of the road?  Something that
  is easily read from a passing car but also doesn't use too much ink from an ink-jet
  printer.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a technical term for the (non-existent) space between
  the text and the edge of the space available?\r\n\r\nExample (not my sign)\r\nThanks\r\n"

    margins. In the example shown, the margins were apparently set to zero. Or perhaps
    it originally had some margins but then the paper was trimmed to fit the signboard."

  body: "> Any thoughts on a good font for hand made road side signs?\r\n\r\nIt's
    too broad a question. It's like someone you've never met asking you to pick clothes
    for them.\r\n\r\nIn general you'd want a font that was easy to read (not highly
    condensed or stylized), probably in upper & lower case rather than all caps, and
    big enough to be read at the distance people will see it (you might want to do
    a test). \r\n\r\nBeyond that your choice of fonts will depend on picking a font
    that's appropriate for the event. What kind of event are you advertising? What
    kind of people do you want the sign to attract? And so forth. For example the
    appropriate fonts for an old-fashioned ice cream social might be different than
    ones for a hot-rod show. \r\n\r\nAs far as saving ink, I doubt if it's going to
    be a big factor if you're just making a few signs."

    Boot Sale\", right? Not Macy's. \r\n\r\nA slick, professional looking sign probably
    won't help you. Personally, and maybe it's just me, but I tend to be a little
    more wary of those people at flea-markets, garage sales, farmers markets, etc.
    who have professionally made signs. I tend to assume I won't get a good deal from
    them. \r\n\r\nIf you want to save ink and have th time and inclination, you could
    print your sign in a faint colours and fill in the colours by hand... Just a thought.
    have fun with it. \r\n \r\n"

    Transport, Interstate, Highway Gothic or Clearview Hwy, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, have
    you seen the price of printer ink these days. I was thinking if using no fill
    and upping the stroke would work. Good idea about the fill with a marker pen.\r\n\r\nLowering
    the opacity would have the same effect as eco-font from a distance wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nI'm
    just curious, there's no actual project involved.\r\n"

    Or, for similar enjoyment, use transfer letters or those vinyl stickers, whatever
    they're called.\r\n\r\n* Now, here's a way to save ink, and, more importantly,
    get something that looks like type on a poster too large to print.\r\n\r\n1. Type
    and print message as large as you want it (maybe on several sheets of paper combined).\r\n2.
    Trace over the outline of the letters in pencil on the back of the sheets.\r\n3.
    Put printouts on top of foam core (etc), tape in place, rub or scribble over edges
    of letters\r\n4. The outline of the letters is transferred to the poster.\r\n5.
    Fill in with marker or paint"

  body: "Zeb, if your budget is extremely tight then just hand print them with a marker.
    It won't cost anything and is perfectly appropriate for a homemade sign.\r\n\r\nOr
    make one with your inkjet printer and then make xerox copies. Black and white
    Xeroxes will just cost a few cents each. Most copy shops can Xerox up to 11 x
    17 (the size of two 8.5 x 11 sheets side by side), which might be a better size
    for a poster.\r\n\r\n"

    enough to be printed on a desktop inkjet probably isn't going to get read by most
    passing traffic anyway.  It's just too small.  Unless maybe it's posted on a street
    where people drive very slowly, or next to a stop sign."
