  body: "Yes and no, Georg. According to my notes, Script Bold was Monotype's 1931,
    ahem ..., \"version\" of Lautenbach's earlier Pr\xE4gefest. There are lots of
    little details that differ, though. Look at the construction of the 'n' and crossbar
    of the 't' for two examples."

  body: "Well, of course its different. But I thought Praegefest was first and Monotype
    1931 changed some minor details, so they did not hurt any copyrights. Am I to
    open to tell, how it is? Or am I wrong? However...\r\n\r\nI'ld say the source
    font was Praegefest. \r\nMh? Yes, right: I don't like Monotype lead fonts too
    much.\r\nBut its only my personal opinion.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\nBy the way: \r\nHow
    do you guys like my new Avatar?\r\nIts from A. Paul Weber.\r\nI got the idea looking
    the News in TV about the crash yesterday. I hopy you guys will survive it.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
