body: I know there&#39;s been discussion of the Modern&#39;s new logo type, but does
  anyone know what the text face is that they&#39;re now using internally? I noticed
  it in the large print that&#39;s stenciled onto the walls next to the exhibits,
  but it appears to be the same or similar to what they&#39;re using in their printed
  materials. I&#39;ll scan and post a sample if I can find one.
