  body: "I'm doing a visual profile for a contemporary church in Bergen, Norway. The
    audience are 20-30 year olds, mostly young families and students. The visual expression
    will probably change a lot over time but I want to build a solid ground for experimenting.\r\n\r\nI'm
    using Officina Serif in their logo, as well as for text."
