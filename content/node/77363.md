body: "I've designed this logo for a small company that gives music, art, and sports
  lessons\u2014aptly called MASA:music, arts, and sports academy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Billboard-02_3843.png]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm
  having some issues with the logo type below the actual stylized logotype. I've put
  MASA in stylized block forms, this having it's own rationale, but\r\n\r\n1) I can't
  decide on a good enough face (i tried DIN) to set \"music, arts, and sports academy\"
  below the block forms. I want something that the company can also use as their brand
  typeface to use in their documents.\r\n\r\n and;\r\n\r\n2) whether to put:\r\n\r\n\u201Cmusic
  arts + sports academy\u201D\r\n\u201Cmusic, arts and sports academy\u201D\r\n\u201Cmusic
  + arts + sports academy\u201D\r\n\r\nis there some typographic rule when setting
  words strung like that? I feel like the comma takes away from the logo's possible
  timelessness or whatever, and disrupts its rhythm.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly
  appreciated. This is my first post as a new member on typophile.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I did not read Masa at all, and couldn't really see it after you said so either.
    I'm not sure if it really works or not. Something along the lines of Gotham (Rounded?)
    might fit the shapes. Or another geometric sans.

  body: I see MASA in your forms - why not look for a typeface that mirrors the blocky
    shape of your forms - something very square to match your shapes but more easily
    readable. Good concept!

  body: "I like the minimalist approach of the logo, but I would never know it said
    MASA unless you told me. And it'll get worse when you reduce the logo small, like
    on a business card or small web ad, as the differences between letters will become
    very tiny. \r\n\r\nBut I like the general approach if you could just make the
    shapes a little more obvious.\r\n\r\nAs for question #2 I'd go with \u201Cmusic
    + arts + sports academy\u201D. Bullets would also work -- \"music \u2022 arts
    \u2022 sports academy\"."

  body: I went with  the + signs for separation. I dont have Gotham so I opted for
    Avenir. Is there a big difference between the two in terms of nuances? Avenir
    seems a bit more playful? (something I'd be going for)

    read MASA right away. The /M/ is particularly giving me a hard time, I read it
    as a /U/. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to keep the 4-blocks-idea but to improve
    readability. You might find some inspiration here:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/square+ultra/fonts/"

    a light weight of a contemporary slab serif?\r\nThe monoline would be \"flat\"
    to match the graphic quality of the logo.\r\nThe light weight suitably arty, and
    the slab robust enough for sport."

  body: "I read MASA at first as well, although I'd try to round the upper corners
    of the M and have the same bottom as the A, but that's just an idea that might
    (or might not) work.\r\n\r\nHow about just writing MUSIC / ARTS / SPORTS underneath
    the logo? I just have the problem that in my opinion music and arts are too separated
    in comparison to sports academy. Maybe you could try to write the 3 disciplines
    in one line and academy in the second to emphasize the connection of academy to
    all three."

    issues, you can probably bet that people who don't spend their days scrutinizing
    letterforms will have issues as well.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of using + / or |
    between the words, but if you're going to use bars you may want to extend them
    above the cap-height/below the baseline.\r\n\r\nHave you tried Proxima Nova for
    your accompanying type? Its circular geometric forms (I think) would compliment
    your square-ish designs nicely and provide some interesting contrast, especially
    in all caps and maybe tracked out a bit.\r\n\r\n"
