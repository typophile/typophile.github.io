body: "As I announced previously, David and I wanted to do something special with
  #200 of the <a href=\"http://typographi.com/001024.php\" target=\"new\">TypeCon2005
  booklet</a>. Well, just yesterday I found it in my mail, after it had travelled
  all over Europe* -- together with #000 and #001 -- collecting the last signatures.\r\n\r\nYup,
  this extremely limited copy of the booklet not only sports the magical number 200
  of 200, but its title page is signed by all the type designers who participated
  in this project. The list ranges from young up-and-comers to card carrying type
  design celebrities: Stefan Hattenbach, Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez, Tom\xE1\u0161 Brousil,
  Nick Shinn, {ths}, Rian Hughes, Randy Jones, Mark Simonson, Peter Bil\u2019ak, Eduardo
  Manso and David Berlow.\r\n\r\nSo, David and I <em>are</em> keeping the equally
  signed #000 and #001 for ourselves -- heh, we're not <em>that</em> crazy --, but
  number 200 will be auctioned to the highest bidder. Even better, we decided that
  the money raised by this auction will be split in half and donated to both the SOTA
  and ATypI organisations. We might occasionally rail against capitalism running amok
  and corporate greed on Typographer.org, but at least we put our money where our
  mouth is. We made this booklet for the community, and now we're giving back to the
  community. I hope this will be sufficient incentive to bid generously.\r\n\r\nI
  will add more details in this thread soon. For now, check this out...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Booklet_200.jpg]\r\n*
  Yes indeed, although we shipped it in a protective envelope, sandwiched between
  two pieces of cardboard, the corners are ever so slightly worn. But I feel this
  only adds to its charm. You can actually <em>see</em> it has been places. ;^)"

    bidding stuff. Anybody has any brilliant suggestions? I can't seem to get hold
    of my partner in crime David who's moving house.

    -- and we can't decide what to do, so we'll leave it up to you guys'n'gals.\r\n\r\nDo
    you prefer eBay or sealed bids through a web form? eBay auctions tend to escalate,
    which could help make more money, but sealed bids give people the opportunity
    to bid what they <em>really</em> think it's worth. Let us know."

    interest in seeing the bidding escalate. :)\r\n\r\nThank you very much for this
    initiative, Yves and David. I'm notified the ATypI board and secretariat about
    this. Once you have the auction set up, I'll put a news item on the ATypI website
    and the member discussion list."

  body: Yves, it's so exciting to hear about these fully signed rare copies. I really
    appreciate your and David's generosity in donating proceeds to SOTA and ATypI
    - thank you so much. I have notified the SOTA board as well, and once the auction
    is live, I can post to the TypeCon email news list.  I look forward to the auction
    - it's bound to be a nail-biter.

    the main item page, right to the picture, <strong>Huidig bod:</strong> means <em>Current
    bid</em>. Right underneath the current bid amount, the button says <strong>Bod
    plaatsen ></strong> which means <em>Place bid</em>. Click it.\r\n\r\nOn the next
    page, in the right hand column, fill in your <strong>Gebruikersnaam</strong> <em>(User

    the button <strong>Veilig inloggen ></strong>.\r\n(If you are not yet registered
    to eBay, I suggest you do that on the English-language website. That'll save you
    a lot of trouble.)\r\n\r\nOn the next page, you can place your bid where it says
    <strong>\tJe maximumbod:</strong> <em>(Your maximum bid)</em> and then click the
    button <strong>Doorgaan ></strong> to continue.\r\n\r\nOn the next page you confirm
    your bid by clicking the button <strong>Bod bevestigen</strong>.\r\n\r\nGood luck
