    about your sample, i.e. where and when it appeared?\r\nThe final _ss_ seems to
    be a ligature.\r\nDon"

    A visiting card script designed by Monotype in 1938. The previous year Monotype
    produced Grosvenor  Script, which is similar but with short descenders.\r\n\r\nUPDATED
    INFO:\r\nLuc Devroye comments on Dorchester Scrip:\r\n\"Script, issued in 1938
    by Monotype, based on a Grover Foundry script found in Ichabod Dawkes's News Letter

    of the image:\r\nhttps://archive.org/stream/specimensofprint00mackrich#page/36/mode/2up\r\n\r\nLooks
    like the name is called \"Sansom Script\". Searching at Luc Devroye site turns
    out the typeface was designed by Hermann Ihlenburg\r\n\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-38296.html\r\n\r\nDoesn't
    seem to have any digital version available"

  body: "It's been several years since I went through the MS&J Specimen Book of 1892,
    but now that you mention it I do recall seeing the display of Sansom Script.\r\nNote
    that the practice of the day was to show the font in use and not provide a full
    character set. So it's necessary to use imagination to see the shapes of characters
    not included in the presentation.\r\nI considered the idea of making a digital
    version. I tracked down the patent. Despite the poor quality of the patent image
    -- bureaucratic masterminds in the Patent Office made crappy quality microfilm
    of the patent applications and trashed the originals so that this was all that
    was available for the recent digitization of patent records -- it at least shows
    the general outlines of the characters not included in the specimen Book. I extracted
    the full character set and rearranged the letters into shorter lines at are easier
    to assess.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SamsomScriptIhlenburgD18735_1888SM_5621.jpg]\r\nNo
    further work done on the project.\r\nDon"

  body: "BTW it is possible to digitize  Hermann Ihlenburg's fancy scripts. See the
    excellent treatment of his Centennial Script by Rebecca Alaccari for Canada Type
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/centennial-script/ The original metal
    type of these scripts was extremely fragile and printed text other than the ones
    in the Specimen Book often show broken, bent or missing connecting lines. It is
    only with the arrival of digital type that they can be widely used.\r\nDon"
