  body: Here is another case where Frutiger would work. Also, consider Myriad Pro,
    which has multiple options. Both are easy to read and are soft to the eye. If
    you are looking for a serif style, consider Cheltenham, a dignified serif face
    that has been doing its job for a very long time.

  body: "I ran across this when I looked at Cheltenham:\r\n\r\n<cite>Daniel Berkeley
    Updike seems to have stimulated the architect Bertram G. Goodhue to design the
    prototype in 1896 for Ingalls Kimball at the Cheltenham Press. Six years later
    Morris Fuller Benton at ATF developed it into the design and then the series that
    we know today.\u201COwing to certain eccentricities of form,\u201D writes Updike,
    <strong>\u201Cit cannot be read comfortably for any length of time.\u201D </strong>But
    he concludes: \u201CIt is, however, an exceedingly handsome letter for ephemeral
    printing.\u201D Mergenthaler bought composing machine rights to the original design
    c.1896, but bought the Benton design in 1904.</cite>\r\n\r\njust wondering are
    you sure about Cheltenham.  It looks good to me but, I am not an expert on such
    matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>Here is another case where Frutiger would work.
    Also, consider Myriad Pro, which has multiple options. Both are easy to read and
    are soft to the eye.</cite>\r\n\r\ni thought that two sans were not to be used
    together.  Is this not correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI

    it is extended. It doesn't do well when it is in the regular form. The biggest
    problem with Eurostile is that I have never found a good serifed match unless
    it is italic. JMO.\r\n\r\nAlso check out URW Latino: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/latino/"
