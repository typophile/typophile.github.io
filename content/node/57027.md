  My question is this: any good online CSS resources that you use on a regular basis?
  I already use the W3C website religiously, and a few others.\r\n\r\nAlso the following
  question: Is there a CSS website that specifically deals with hacks/workarounds
  for different browsers, or deals with common CSS problems?\r\n\r\nAnd after learning
  CSS for the last few months, all I have to say can be expressed with the graphic
  below. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/modernwebdesign_6615.jpg]"

    not so much a CSS resource, this is one of the best CSS \"hacks\" I've found:\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/\r\n\r\nHere's
    the description from the source on what it does:\r\n\r\n\"IE7 is a JavaScript
    library to make Microsoft Internet Explorer behave like a standards-compliant
    browser. It fixes many HTML and CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly
    under IE5 and IE6.\"\r\n\r\nI've only used this on one site, but it was effective.
    The most amazing thing about it is that it forces IE5/IE6 to display true transparency
    with .png's! Very useful and easy to implement, since there is only a link to
    the actual script as opposed to a bunch of embedded code."

    Mezzoblue IS the CSS Zen Garden. Owned, operated, created, etc. So I'd say its
    a reliable resource for the CSS Zen Garden.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the Zen Garden is
    awesome. Some great typography in there too."

    me, it shows us exactly how fragile a creation c.s.s. is...\r\n\r\nbump up the
    font-size -- even just one notch -- and\r\n_many_ of the designs break.  bump
    it up two or three\r\nand almost all of them break, some quite spectacularly.\r\n\r\nthis
    illustrates that most designers -- even web types --\r\nstill haven't yet absorbed
    the first lesson, which is that\r\nthe designer no longer controls the size of
    the canvas.\r\n\r\nif c.s.s. was dirt-simple, it might be ok that it's also so\r\nfeeble.
    \ but when it's feeble _and_ it's complex?  _crap_.\r\n\r\nadd in the way its
    progress has been stalled completely\r\nby the \"standards\" process, and it's
    a full-on _tragedy_.\r\n\r\njust another example of how technocrats are failing
    us.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\np.s.  and please, before you get all upset and flame

    of those designs is completely correct,\r\nmeaning i can post one screenshot after
    another here\r\n-- one thousand screenshots after another thousand --\r\nto \"prove\"
    the point.  don't get into a fight you can't win.\r\n\r\n"

    for information\r\non the commenter and timestamping...\r\n\r\na 600-pixel center
    column for the post.\r\n\r\nand another 200-pixel column at right,\r\njust at
    the top, for account information\r\nand a few ads and assorted other stuff.\r\n\r\nso
    the aim is a 1024-pixel-width screen.\r\n\r\nmaking the viewport any wider than
    that\r\ngive you miles and miles of whitespace...\r\n\r\n(my screen is 1920-pixels
    wide, and it's\r\njust a 23-incher, so i'm sure that many\r\nof you out there
    have much bigger ones.)\r\n\r\nlikewise, narrowing the window to _less_\r\nthan
    the 1024-pixel designed width will\r\nproduce a horizontal scrollbar, which is\r\n_not_
    what the web is \"supposed\" to do...\r\n\r\nfurther, narrowing to less than the
    600\r\npixels, constituting the \"content column\"\r\nin the middle, simply breaks
    the design.\r\n\r\nso the only sense in which this \"reflows\"\r\nis when a user
    changes their font-size.\r\nand, if we really believe that a measure\r\nis \"optimum\"
    with a certain number of\r\n_characters_, then that type of \"reflow\"\r\nis one
    that breaks optimum readability.\r\n\r\nnone of this is a dig at the design here.\r\n(because
    i think the design is quite fine.)\r\n\r\nit _is_ a dig at the generally-understood\r\nnotion
    of what we _are_ doing on the web,\r\nversus what we _say_ that we are doing,
    and\r\nversus what we _should_actually_ be doing\r\n(which i'm not sure any of
    us really knows)...\r\n\r\nbut we all just trudge along pretending everything\r\nis
