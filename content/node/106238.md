  body: "Was not able to find the name but it's most probably a bespoke typeface,
    exclusive and proprietary of Neue Z\xFCrcher Zeitung (NZZ) newspaper. You could
    read a [[http://ia.net/blog/nzz-relaunch-a-quick-review|detailed article]] on
    its redesign on IA blog. Design agency in charge of this relaunch was [[http://www.meireundmeire.de/projects/project/neue_zuercher_zeitung|Meir\xE9
    und Meir\xE9]] but even on their business case, no name or reference to it is
    given."

  body: Duplicate Ionic Thin, Zizou Sans NZZ, Franklin Gothic and Walbaum are used
    on <a href="http://static.nzzwerbung.ch/1378213682/gesellschaft_fs_d_2013.pdf">this
    PDF</a>. The serif typeface on your images might be Duplicate Ionic. Anyway, I
    think it is Commercial Type-ish and is similar to <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/zizousans.shtml">Zizou
    Sans</a> and <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/zizouslab.shtml">Zizou
    Slab</a>.
