  idiosyncratic features (esp. Q, 2 and ampersand) but any clues as to what it is
  \u2014 and especially suggestions for a good digital alternative \u2014\_are much
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks."

    a digital scan I found on my work's server!

    tail on Q have a passing resemblance to Concord and Accord from Soneri Type:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/soneri/concord/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/soneri/accord/\r\nDon"
