  body: "Sentinel\r\n\r\nI have a fondness for Clarendon's as they were used commonly
    in Scotland along with Helvetica in the early 1970s, and I associate them with
    happy times climbing around mountains there. I also have a pocket Oxford English
    Dictionary from 1939 that I really like - which is all in Clarendon. It may not
    be the most readable but is a lot better looking than the ugly Parable font. The
    problem is, I don't really know when Clarendon's are useful. I think they are
    better in advertising than for prolonged reading. I don't think they are as popular
    as they were in a more industrial time, and polishing up Clarendon may defeat
    that industrial look."

  body: "Yes, thank you, I'll add it to my research. \r\nWell, I'm aiming at Clarendon,
    because it was a type common in the prints of time and space of the book I'm working
    on, (1850s in Rio de Janeiro). And I figured it would give the feeling of that
    time. Main topics of the story is slavery, humanism, family and liberty, so I
    was looking for a slightly more open/free look. But it's like you said, it can
    lose the whole Clarendon look.\r\nThe Sentinel and Clarendon's light weight are
    good for what I want, if you can name others that you think to fit better the
    topics, I thank you.\r\n"

    question for setting text \u2014 because they lack italics.\"\r\n\r\n1) Some Clarendons
    do have Italics. Just because the first ones didn't doesn't set that in stone.
    There's nothing \"anti-Italic\" in the Clarendon genre, at least not more than
    many other genres.\r\n2) That sounds very dogmatic. With enough weights one can
    avoid Italics, which I myself actually find unintelligent. Look at Typo magazine
    (still?) to see how. It's not that Italics is useless, but saying \"out of the
    question\" is a bit much.\r\n\r\nAnyway, is Sentinel \"humanist\" enough? It looks
    like just another Clarendon (albeit very complete and polished). That said, I
    think we need some more parameters, Rafael.\r\n\r\nBTW I think Parable is very
    beautiful in a more important way than mere looks: reading. To me Pretty has little

    Further, Canada Type''s Clarendon Text documentation says that it is excellent
    for small print (8pt), but relative to other digital offerings of Clarendon, such
    as Lintotype/Monotype or URW, are these types suitable for small print as is pictured

  body: "I've seen more detailed references to that typeface now; it was used in the
    Cameo edition of the Bible from the press of the University of Cambridge, and
    it was called Petit Mediaeval Clarendon 1159. I suspect that the number means
    it is a Monotype face.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've seen no references to a Monotype Series
    1159. However, the Cambridge Bible catalogue does refer to another Bible as being
    set in Goudy Old Style Bold (the displayed sample doesn't look like it) 441, and
    that <em>is</em> a Monotype series number.\r\n\r\nOther Bibles are set in faces
    from Miller and Richards, such as their Antique Old Style (the face by Henry Taylor
    Wyse that was later revived by Alexander Phemister as Bookman) and their Modern
    Roman No. 2.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It was the Fann Street Foundry of Reed and Fox that
    was the successor to Belsey, so they had the right to the name Clarendon; and
    I see they used the name Mediaeval for their version of the Phemister Old Style,
    and, in addition, they had a Mediaeval Egyptian.\r\n\r\nSo, although I can't find
    their later specimen books - or even, at the moment, a reference to indicate what
    their name was in 1920, if they were still in business - at the moment I am now
    going to suspect it was from them that Petit Mediaeval Clarendon was obtained.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Well, MyFonts tells me that Stephenson Blake took their stuff in 1906, so that
    settles it.\r\n\r\nEDIT: If one leaves off the Petit, the Flinsch typefoundry
    had a typeface called Mediaeval Clarendon which was designed in 1878 by one W.
    Kirkwood.\r\n\r\nAh, here he is:\r\n\r\n[[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-41678.html]]\r\n\r\nand
    I've seen Windsor in a recent Letraset catalogue.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've seen a showing
    of a specimen in a magazine about printing. Schmale Medi\xE6val-Clarendon, from
    Flinsch, is highly condensed, and so it isn't the Petit Medi\xE6val Clarendon
    used in Cambridge Bibles, which is quite wide.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kirkwood_4135.jpg]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there is still hope. Perhaps while Schmale means condensed, Petit doesn't, and
    is the name for the point size (as illustrated in this image!) used by mistake.\r\n\r\nUnlike
    any other Clarendon I've seen before, it does have one important characteristic
    of the Bible face in question: a capital J that descends below the line."

    think of Clarendons as legibility faces for the Bible.\r\n\r\nLanston Monotype
    76J, Modern Antique Condensed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/76j_5211.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    appears to be the face used in the St. Joseph New Catholic Edition, by the Catholic
    Book Publishing Co. of New York, in an octavo edition of the Confraternity-Douay
    version of the Bible published from 1941 to around 1962.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/books005_4448.jpg]\r\n\r\nBefore
    being replaced by a different version, the New American Bible (very shortly after
    the Confraternity version was completed, so it no longer had to rely on the Douay
    Old Testament) it was used widely in Catholic schools. (Actually, the next common
    Bible in Catholic schools used the New Testament from the New American Bible with
    the now-completed Old Testament from the Confraternity version.)\r\n\r\nWhat had
    made me so confident that it was a Lanston Monotype face to persevere till I found
    it was that the footnotes\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/books006_5759.jpg]\r\n\r\nclearly
    matched Lanston Monotype's No. 2.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Cincinnati Type Foundry
    used the name Modern Antique Condensed for a completely different typeface, which
    was a Latin (wedge serif) rather than a Clarendon.\r\n\r\nIn looking for legible
    typefaces used in Bibles, I found Lucerna, Veritas, and Lexikon, none of them
    Clarendons. (The first two were specifically designed for Bible translations;
    the third, for a dictionary, and later used in Bibles.) Continuing on with the
    search, I encountered Nimrod - and Minion and Monticello, beautiful typefaces,
    but, not being designed for super-high values of optical legibility, stowaways
    in my search results.\r\n\r\n<cite>is Medieval Clarendon specifically a letterpress
    type? I cannot find a specific mention of \"Medieval\" Clarendon in digital format</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    didn't know the answer to that, but now I've found a page,\r\n\r\n[[http://www.cambridge.org/index.php?cID=81572]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    gives me some insight into the matter. The edition of the Bible in question is
    a photographic reproduction of one printed by letterpress means in 1920. However,
    it has been retouched to be as sharp and clear as if it were newly typeset.\r\n\r\nI
    had thought the face might be a proprietary digital one, because before I had
    thought this might be an entirely new edition, even if the style of printing is
    reminiscent of older Bibles. I think I have seen Bibles in a typeface which much
    more strongly resembles this particular face than Modern Antique Condensed does.\r\n\r\nA
    search finds several Bibles in this typeface, all from Cambridge. The Cambridge
    catalog also references one Monotype face, Goudy Old Style Bold 441, and two from
    Miller and Richards, Modern Number 2 and Old Style Antique. But the names Mediaeval
    and Clarendon are not used by them - but they are used by the Fann Street Foundry
    of Reed and Fox.\r\n\r\nMonotype New Clarendon and URW++ Volta are interesting
    light wide Clarendons.\r\n\r\nAh, I've found a Clarendon Bible formerly published
    by Oxford, now brought out by R. L. Allan. And Domine, a Google Web Font with
    some Clarendon influence.\r\n\r\nAh, I've found some references to a typeface
    called \"Brevier Blackface\".\r\n\r\nAlso, I've seen one Bible set in Bookman
    Old Style, which seems to resemble a traditional legibility face.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I have now found this specimen book, from Bauer, which eventually bought Flinsch,
    online,\r\n\r\n[[https://archive.org/details/hauptprobeingedr00baue]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    contains a typeface at least similar to the Mediaeval Clarendon:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauer_med_5024.jpg]\r\n\r\nInterestingly
    enough, they have Jenson Old Style in that book too, and they call it Elzevir!\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the Petit size (8 Didones) of this face is number 1026; 1159 is a Petit as well,
    but of Enge Antiqua, a completely different and very condensed face.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a 1938 specimen book, so it is after Flinsch and Bauer merged.\r\n\r\nNote
    that neither the Reed & Fox Mediaeval Egyptian nor their Mediaeval Egyptian No.
    2 resembles this."
