  about it in his book Life With Letters.\r\n\r\nThe family had several weights and
  they were all based on Railroad Gothic, but had a proper lowercase. It got a lot
  of use in the 40's and 50's, from what I can tell."

  body: "That would be Murray Hill, a handlettered gothic which originated at Photo-Lettering
    in New York back in those days. The word \"gothic\" was not a part of the name,
    so it would be confusing to many due to the script font of the same name by ATF.
    It must have been very popular due to the wide range they show it in.\r\n\r\nIn
    their index it is listed as follows:\r\nMurray Hill, 9 weights, 4 widths\r\nMurray
    Hill Open, 7 varieties\r\nMurray Hill Shaded, 11 varieties\r\nMurray Hill Stencil,
    3 varieties\r\n\r\nIf you can find a Photo-Lettering Alphabet Thesaurus Volume
    2 specimen book somewhere, you will be able to see samples of it. The alphabet
    showings in the back of the book are not complete and are quite small. You might
    also contact House Industries about it since they bought the entire Photo-Lettering
    library. They may have already issued the fonts in digital form under another
    name.\r\n"
