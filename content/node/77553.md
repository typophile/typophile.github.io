  body: "The CSS says simply \"ClarendonRoman\" (and it's tracked in quite a bit).
    To me, it looks more like Clarendon Heavy. However, most of the uses of it are
    in headings, and the CSS does not have a \"normal\" definition to the \"font-weight\"
    property, so it's possible that the browser (depending on the one it's being veiwed
    in) is creating a faux bold of the Clarendon Roman weight.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    it looks excellent."
