  but I need\r\nGreek, cyrillic, eastern european and turkish charachter sets. Can
  anyone\r\nrecommend something? It's for a corp. ID program which is in transition.\r\nWe
  use Matrix Book for body copy but there are no non-Western characters\r\nin it to
  use in international materials.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance,\r\n\r\nEnrico"

    extend Matrix* as needed? Then find a friendly type designer to carry it out.\r\n\r\n*
    And while you're at it you could fix the \"g\" too:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14378\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
