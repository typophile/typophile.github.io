  used in the current Wendy's campaigns. The query got emailed around the office,
  but no one knew what it was although a few people took an early lunch that day...
  \r\n\r\nIt caught my eye because it has a really pointy W but a slope and slightly
  calligraphic feel to some of the characters. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nFG\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontID_burger_4744.jpg]"
