body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm curious as to what charts and graphs looked like before
  computers were around to create them. I'm less interested in the how than in the
  style, or even if data was presented graphically at all. Could it be that we only
  have pie-charts because, all of a sudden, Xcel appeared and allowed us to do it?
  \r\n\r\nWhile there seems to be plenty of examples of pre-digital era typography,
  photography, cartography or any other kind of '-ography', data design is almost
  non-existant (in my knowledge at least, I realise this could be my failing, not
  the graphic world's) \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any examples of data graphics, or
  any kind of history of this aspect of graphic design? \r\n\r\nTa, \r\nAnthony\r\n\r\n(Sorry,
  I realise this isn't typography as such, but is rather a related discipline.)"

    may take you in the right direction\r\n\r\nhttp://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/\r\n\r\nHis
    area of expertise is the visual display of information and he works  from historical
    as well as contemporary examples. His writing is a must for anyone who needs to
    display information visually."

    magazines. Some beautiful infographics in their early (pre-computer) issues.\r\n\r\nSeeing
    the Edward Tufte work that's already been suggested certainly reminded me of NG...
    and you can usually find a stack of them for cheap at a local thrift store."

  body: "If you are going to look at Tufte, you must view the other side and look
    at  <a href=\"http://www.nigelholmes.com/home.htm\">Nigel Holmes</a>. \r\nHis
    website features his more up-to-date computer based work, but his work for Time
    magazine in the late 70s and 80s set the standard for modern illustrative info-graphics.
    Tufte has called him a chartoonist, and dismisses his approach, and you will have
    to speak with Nigel to get his opinion on Tufte. Still there is alot more of Holmes
    work out there in the work-a-day world than there is Tufte's."

  body: "We did thousands of charts and graphs before computers. It took longer drawing
    the line work by hand (ruling pen and compass). We used Amberilth or Rubylith
    film to cut layers of color and tone separations for camera. \r\nIn those days,
    if someone came back with data changes, you charged them an arm and a leg so there
    was less of the hourly changes of data than there is today. Look mat any annual
    reports done pre 1986 and you will see.\r\nThe big difference was that because
    it was laborious, it was not overdone as it tends to be today.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
