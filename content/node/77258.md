  body: I wonder if there is a way to get the acute to be the arm or needle of the
    record player. Hmm...

  body: The A and the D in the logo are very heavy, especially the A, and always attract
    my attention more than the O, which should be the focus. Also the acute looks
    too thin for the font.

  body: "The acute needs to be bolder and the D appears weak in comparison to other
    characters) whether this is fault of the typeface or not is irrelevant, I would
    suggest widening these a little manually). The N on the other hand looks a little
    too bold in comparison to the M. Possibly the centre of the O could be larger
    with a larger 'record-centre' if you will. \r\n\r\nLovely idea and not too far
    off being a brilliant graphic. "
