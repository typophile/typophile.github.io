  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys, <BR> <BR>As can be followed in earlier threads, I'm working on my type called Nordic. Now I'm sketching on the 'textversion'. It will propably not become a real text face, but it surely should feel like it.  <BR> <BR>Can you give me some good critique. Is this the right direction I'm going? This are some very early sketches where I'm trying to find out if the type work well in the light and the fat extremes. The weights inbetween then propably work as well. <BR>I want the fat version to be rounder, like a blown up balloon. The more light the weight, the straighter the verticals. Makes sence? <BR>This is the first time I'm doing a textface so all the tips are welcome. I feel I'm not good in keeping the type consistent in it's details.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27217.gif" alt="Nordiclight"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27218.gif" alt="Nordicfat"> <BR> <BR>See the difference in the light and the fat lc 's'. Would you like it with or without the spurs? <BR>I'm not really sure how to handle the horizontals (a, e, g, s). Should they be much thinner than the verticals, as you can see above, or should they be 'equally' thick? That would make it more fat and I would loose a lot of details. <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Vertical proportions: I'd use the one from the top attempt - the darker one is too small on the body. <BR> <BR>I think you need to make the forms less exagerated, like the &quot;a&quot; and especially the &quot;e&quot; are too far from the good norm. <BR> <BR>The &quot;s&quot;: they both work, in their weights. <BR> <BR>Some people might tell you to make the stroke distribution &quot;classical&quot; in the dark weight - like give the &quot;v&quot; a thinner right arm. I like symmetrical weight in this sort of design, so I'd actually recommend keeping the way you have it - you just need to modulate it a bit to prevent a bunching-up of color. <BR> <BR>BTW, I'd make the &quot;m&quot; less narrow. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

The characteristic with the 'a' and 'e' is the diagonal. I would like to keep this, because it's a characteristic for the Nordic Family.

I will keep on developing it, but now I need a bit of concentration for the newbee. <BR> <BR>I promissed my girlfriend her own font for her writing. She's writing her own book and parallel also writing for the Weight Watchers Magazine as a psychologist.  <BR>Having her own font would incurrage her to write more on her own book.

I see that the horizontals are thinner, but it looks like you took off 7 everywhere. Yes? The trouble is that you've drawn what should be a 2 weight alphabet, but it has at least 3 weights. In other words too much noticable variation in the thins IMHO. Some variation is required, but they should *look* the same. For example the thins on the top and bottom of the c probably will be thicker than the thins on the d. The c needs all the darkness it can get! The d could shed a few pounds. See what I mean?

I like your style and I think you have a very good eye for those details we all love and hate. So keep 'm coming. <BR> <BR>&gt; but it looks like you took off 7 everywhere. <BR> <BR>Yes, I took 7em off of all the horizontals, but not the diagonals in the bowl/stem connection. I think it looks better because the inner spaces are more open. And ofcourse the overall spacing.  <BR> <BR>Ligatures - Don't force the fi. <BR> <BR>I made them only as a gag. I don't really need them with my glyph weight and spacing. But I personally like them so I made them. <BR> <BR>&gt; hat should be a 2 weight alphabet, but it has at least 3 <BR> <BR>The Nordic Narrow was used in Items, one of the leading Dutch magazines in (graphic) design and a design magazine from Barcelona. Since I saw that I like it much better in bigger sizes. I started it as a font for small sizes, but it came out the other way.  <BR>So therefor I'm thinking about reducing the font to 3 weights; Light, Regular, Black. How does that sound? <BR> <BR>&gt;  but they should *look* the same. <BR> <BR>I see that now. I'm very often not bold enough to leave the grid. I'm in a way too pragmatic, I guess. When I see the details now and read your crits, I know your right and I will go for it.  <BR>Problem is also that I created this whole Nordic Narrow on the computer. I made it out of Nordic A Narrow so no handdrawn sketches were made. That means also that all the spontaneity is constructed. Therefor I easily oversee obvious 'mistakes'. <BR> <BR>I have a lot to do. No time over the week, so I'll have to sacrefice my weekend again.  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren</div>

I'm probably using the wrong terminology. <BR> <BR>Also before you make really drastic changes based on my opinion, note: My comments were very nitpicky. And I am having second thoughts about your b/d. The current modulation hints at a little diagonal stress in an otherwise very up and down font. That could be a nice departure and soften it up a little. At this point I wouldn't change it. <BR> <BR>In the glyphs I highlighted, the only things I would reccomend you change from a technical standpoint are adding the weight to the bowl of the a and thinning the ear and waist of the g. <BR> <BR>Carry on.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Randy, <BR> <BR>I see what you mean with the weights. That doesn't change my opinion to the three weights though. <BR>I made the bowl/stem connections thinner than the other horizontals to reduce stress. Like I said I started off making a font for small sizes. The current thin parts are a leftover from that, but still I think they work because they reduce some weight in a difficult spot in the glyph.  <BR>The difficulty here is that I want to keep the diagonals in the font that are the most important characteristics. In the Light you can see them very well. These areas are almost flat and then go over in the bowl. In the Black they become more round so I have to do some optical surgery. <BR>Normally I would make a nice thin connection to the stem and then a female round curve to the bowl. Hmm, I love typography. ;-) <BR> <BR>Thanks for the *advice*, it's very very welcome. <BR> <BR></div>
