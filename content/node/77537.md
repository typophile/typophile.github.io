  body: Hmm, not a ligature proper, it looks to me, but a loop on /a/ ready to connect

    see it clearly on the bigger images. It's something akin the entry and exit strokes
    in shool handwriting.\r\n\r\nI shall call them \"pre-emptive ligatures\"! ;-)"

    \ This website is a gem for history buffs like myself. I wonder 200 years from
    now, if our descendants will ponder why our print media spent so much time scaring
    people with SARS-swine flu-bird flu doomsday predictions/scenarios. Last year,
    so many people with a common cold or bronchitis sat petrified in ER's. \r\n"
