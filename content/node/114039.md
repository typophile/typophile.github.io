  Identifont and WhatTheFont with no success.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot:\r\nhttp://cl.ly/image/1y0E2Q1H0f3O\r\n\r\nIt's
  also used hear, and you can type in and see all different letters:\r\nhttp://www.thestationerystudio.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.viewProduct&productId=38782&catId=1175\r\n\r\nI'm
  getting married, and someone bought us these as an engagement gift. I'd love to
  make other things match if I can figure out what it is! If it cannot be found, I'd
  love to find something as close as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatthew"
