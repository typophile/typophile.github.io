body: 'Hi all, <BR> <BR>I am creating a font with fontlab 4.6 that uses non-standard
  &#40;custom&#41; ligatures. <BR> <BR>Everything seems ok when compiling the font
  and testinf it in the preview pane. <BR> <BR>nb: I entered the ligatures by first
  drawing the glyphs and assigning names to them, then, I entered a feature liga {
  sub b a by ba; } liga. <BR> <BR>where &#34;ba&#34; is a custom caracter. <BR> <BR>The
  thing is, although it compiles and is working perfectly in the preview pane, the
  ttf or otf fontlab generates from it seems unaware of the ligatures... <BR> <BR>Is
  there anything I could do about it &#40;I think there is... but what is it?&#41;?
  <BR> <BR>thanks in advance!'

  body: the software you&#39;re using has to implement these features. so far, only
    Adobe CS products &#40;and InDesign 2.0&#41; support automatic substitution of
    OT features. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re hoping to see automatic ligature substitution
    in Microsoft apps or in Quark, you&#39;ll have to wait until they release software
    that supports these things.

  body: So there is no way to have OT features work automatically... Is there instead
    any workaround or trick to have the desired result displayed in any application
    that at least supports ttf? <BR> <BR>Many thanks.

  body: Problems with custom ligature creation in FontLab <BR> <BR>This is a thread
    started in the GENERAL area which I thought might get a few more useful eyeballs
    on it if it were here in the BUILD area.

  body: On Windows the Uniscribe component &#40;usp10.dll&#41; handles the application
    of OpenType features - traditionally it&#39;s only been used for the so-called
    complex script languages. Automatic features for are supported by the latest version
    of Uniscribe, supplied with XP SP2, so in notepad and elsewhere fonts like Zapfino
    and Bickham Script have their default OTL features applied. <BR> <BR>Office uses
    its own version of Uniscribe, and also bypasses Uniscribe for all but complex
    script languages due to the performance issues.  <BR> <BR>Not sure about the Mac
    but I think there&#39;s a similar situation there too.
