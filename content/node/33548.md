  at type design. <!--break-->I want to learn about letterforms and spacing, and also
  want to be able to use a typeface i've designed myself. I've been reading Karen
  Cheng's book on type design and looking at a few well-designed faces for guidance
  on the 'rules' (where strokes should taper, placement of letterform features etc.).
  \r\n\r\nIt's still early days and as i'm sure you'll see immediately that there's
  heaps of work left to do. What I was hoping for were some of your opinions on, and
  some criticism of, how the face works generally. Does it lack character? Is it too
  similar to existing designs? Are there letters that don't fit?\r\n\r\nIt's here
  as a <a href=\"http://www.chrisgaul.net/fonttest3.jpg\">.jpg</a> or as a <a href=\"http://www.chrisgaul.net/fonttest3.pdf\">.pdf</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nChris"

    a first attempt though, it's a fine job.\r\n\r\nI would note that maybe in the
    upper curve of the lowercase a, the inside curve doesn't exactly match the outer
    curve (if that makes any sense). "

  body: "This is great as a learning exercise, but not as something people would want
    to use because it's too bland (without being technically brilliant). Work in your
    own ideas of what the letters \"should\" be, but subtly. The way to develop your
    own ideas is to observe, think and try.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious thing that's wrong
    with it is that the caps are too big. Also, most of the curves are very wobbly,
    the curves are not thick enough compared to the straights, and the spacing is
    too loose. The \"R\" is nice though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
