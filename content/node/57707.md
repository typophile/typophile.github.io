  because it's a great sounding word. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/interrobang\">Interrobang</a>

  body: "This probably sounds mildly weird at best, but this ampersand totally reminds
    me of my ex-roommate's young cat, who would be sitting on the living-room floor
    cleaning her tail, then hear something, yank up her head, and look up and around
    in surprise with her big green eyes, tail still clenched between her front paws.\r\nSee
    it? :)"
