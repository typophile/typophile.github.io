body: "Hello - apologies if this a stupid or often-asked question, but I've managed
  to blag my way into designing a magazine (210mm x 260mm) and am studying like mad
  to get it professional and stylish looking. I'm going for a pre-war british Gill-inspired
  new-retro faded aesthetic but am having problems with my main text serif font. I'd
  like it to look 20s - 50s era London, but it is far far more important that it is
  readable and well balanced as everything else on the page will give the main style
  I'm thinking. After comparing some big name fonts I'm thinking of going for Sabon
  Next - although Mercury looks okay and I'm yet to have a good look at Whitman. Some
  pages are newspaper style - four columns no space, and some more bookish - two column
  loads of space, so I need an allrounder and I figured Sabon to be, not wow-beautiful,
  but serviceable for my needs. I'm not into Garamond (too delicate) or Times (too
  stiff). Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nWhat I really need to know though is the optimum font
  size and leading for the whole thing. I'm thinking of 9.5 Sabon, but what would
  the best leading be? My attempts so far - despite following some really good tutorials,
  being fairly proficient in InDesign, making a neat baseline grid, etc look horribly
  clunky (e.g. nothing as neat and crisp as these - [[http://http://speckyboy.com/2008/06/15/32-inspirational-examples-of-amazing-layout-and-typography/]])
  Basically what's an optimum all-round newspaper-magazine classy brit-style font-leading
  ratio? After going through these good forums I've found Mr Bringhurst, so he'll
  probably be able to answer all my questions when he pops through the letterbox,
  but in the meantime, any thoughts welcomed gratefully.\r\n\r\nAnd sorry again if
  all that sounds \"gawd, not again\"\r\n\r\nKindess,\r\n\r\nDron"

    What kind of content? Average length of articles? \r\nDo you have existing content
    to work with?"

  body: "Hi Jabez, thanks for replying. The magazine is an illustrated retro utopian
    newspaper, its about love and death in these extraordinary times, the audience
    is everyone who feels a love or a yearning for something they can't quite name,
    the content is spoof news articles, neo-regency agony aunts giving subversive
    advice about shoes and sex, guides to world history and staggeringly beautiful
    retro-style adverts for sweet nothing. Average length of articles between 300
    and 3000 and if you can somehow blend what you've just read, with the information
    I've given above about what I know, what I need (body text - titling and so on
    is sorted) and a desire to create a Johnston-Gill style pre-war London aesthetic
    then I shall take my HAT OFF to you!\r\n\r\nAnyrate, your basic advice - obvious
    as it may sound to others - is relatively new to my ears and clearly sound - and
    I thank you for it. Make proofs, take a look and feel in my heart for the balance
    of white and text, etc... The reason I posted is that the 10pt Sabon Next on a
    12pt baseline grid that I decided on after a first proof and print now suddenly
    looks so clunky to me and I can't work out why. (Obviously you'd need to see the
    thing, but that's not poss right now alas)."

    I've read it has \"spacing issues\" which I don't understand but which give me
    the fear)."

    - Lord its tough - and I'd love anyone's thoughts on this one. On the one hand,
    utopia and sabon are so friendly on the eye, meaning, I suppose, they give subliminal
    ease of reading - they're 'transparent' - right? (again apologies for my unschooled
    descriptive fumblings here) Whereas Baskerville, Plantin and company, more attractive,
    but a TAD more difficult to read? Perhaps only because they're a TAD more unfamiliar?\r\n\r\nYesterday
    I was all for utopia, but the commas and the capital R just make me sick, like
    I'm in a 1980's Madison boardroom.  \r\n\r\nSigh. Striking a balance between practicality
    and pulchritude - I suppose this is ever the work of the smith."

    Gill Sans Pro. Minion was the tough one - Plantin, Baskerville and others had
    elegance and Englishness, but I just couldn't get anything to look as good as
    Minion 10pt on 12pt leading - which I copied from Bringhurst. Maybe when I get
    more experienced with this business I can somehow make other fonts look as well
    balanced, stately and readable, but for now it will have to be this. A few things
    about Minion don't work for me, tad angular, horrible capital Q, etc. But looks
    gorgeous on the page and that's that.\r\n\r\nI'm so grateful for all this help
    - I've learnt a lot. Particularly excited about Athelas and MVB Verdigris... maybe
    next time.\r\n\r\nThanks again chaps."
