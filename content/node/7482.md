  body: I don&#39;t want to break protocol here, since I&#39;m not a designated type
    identifier. &#40;I&#39;m gonna register soon - promise&#41;. But since I know
    what this is, I thought I&#39;d pass it on. It&#39;s a shareware/freeware font
    called &#34;riverside&#34;. Here&#39;s a link I found for it &#40;I downloaded
    this many years ago&#41;. <a href="http://www.highfonts.com/fontsearch.asp?ord=RIVERSIDE&amp;f=0"
