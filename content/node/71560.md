  body: "Trajan is SO close too! Serifs on the W and T don't match though - W only
    should have inward-facing Serifs on the top, and T shouldn't have slanted serifs.
    \r\n\r\nI might just have to make due with Trajan - thanks Antonio!"

  body: "Actually, upon closer inspection, you might be 100% right - the sample resolution
    isn't that great, but it looks like the top left serif on the W was cut off, and
    the T top left serif might indeed be sloping down to the left, like Trajan does.\r\n\r\nSOLVED!\r\n\r\nThanks
    Antonio - awesome."
