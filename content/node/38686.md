    It was identified by Daniel Korn as <cite>specific corporate font made by Kontrapunkt,
    as part of their revamp of SuperBrugsen\u2019s identity. It comes in 3 weights;
    light, medium and bold, and is also used in the new logo and most of their other
    material. Oh, and as far as I know it\u2019s simply referred to as \u201CSuperBrugsen
    Font\u201D.</cite>"
