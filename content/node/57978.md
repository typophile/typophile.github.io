  body: "I found a couple of websites that say that the Parlophone symbol was not
    derived from the typographic symbol for the Sterling (British) Pound (i.e., \xA3),
    but rather from a \"German L\" (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlophone\">the
    record label began in Germany</a>). Whether this is true or not is a different
    matter! Maybe a German-speaking Typophile can help with this one."
