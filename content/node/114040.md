  body: "Seems to be custom branding by lg2boutique http://lg2boutique.com/en/work/464/hangar-29-branding\r\nThe
    word HANGAR is in the style of  Sans octagonal/Sans angled.\r\nFor a comparable
    base font see House Industries United Sans Semi Condensed Black\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection\r\nand
    Ryan Clark's Liberator\r\nhttp://www.losttype.com/font/?name=liberator\r\nTo make
    the word HANGAR the upper terminal of the G needs to be clipped and the chin squared.
    Also all corners should be rounded, in the style of Blender by Binnenland Nik
    Thoenen http://www.binnenland.ch/font/about/Blender\r\nDon\r\n"
