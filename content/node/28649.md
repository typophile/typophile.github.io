    Nick's own website as freeware in December of 1999. Thanks muchly, Nick!\r\n\r\nIt
    was based upon the lettering of Samuel Welo, circa 1930 (from the original ReadMe)."

  body: "It is, in fact, freeware, and it's based on a Samuel Welo design from one
    of the many incarnations of his <em>Studio Handbook</em>.\r\n\r\nI no longer host
    freeware fonts on my website because of some SERIOUS abuse of hot-linking when
    I did. I decided to discontinue the free stuff when my excess bandwidth charges
    exceed $1,000 one year. Giving fonts away is one thing; paying $1,000 to do so
    is something completely different."
