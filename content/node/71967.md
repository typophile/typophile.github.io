body: "I am working on my first typeface and would like a bit of advice. I started
  with the lower case letters and am fairly happy unity of the set. I am having a
  bit of trouble, however, with the capital letters. Applying the curvy aesthetic
  of the lower case letters to the upper case is a stretch at times and it makes many
  of the letters look awkward.\r\n\r\nI am curious as to the process of some more
  experienced type designers. Do you start a design with both upper and lower case
  in mind?  What are some tricks you use to balance the two? \r\n\r\nAny general comments
  on the typeface would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks!"

  body: "Basically you're getting tunnel vision about the distinguishing characteristics
    of your typeface. No typeface succeeds with only one salient feature; there are
    always multiple elements working together. Your lowercase k does fine without
    being shaped like an egg, so there is no reason to try to force your capital K
    into the shape of an egg. If you set \"Hello\", there is a reason the ells look
    much better than the H. Sometimes you have to give the recognizable features of
    a letter priority over those of the typeface. Use straight lines wherever they
    are appropriate, and you will find that in context they won't be as out of place
    as you expect.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, you can seek commonly accepted alternatives
    that let you work in the signature shape without compromise: an A can be round
    on top; an E can be shaped like a C with a crossbar; M and N can take the forms
    of a giant m and n."

    I\u2019m not sure the crossbar of A is working. Also B, V, W and Z could be revised.\r\nBut
    I love X and Y!"
