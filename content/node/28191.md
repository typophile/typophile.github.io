body: "It's hard to classify this font that I made. I felt I was inspired by blackletter
  and uncial forms, but clearly this is not either, and it's far too hard to read
  to think of it as display type. Anyway, I'd just like to get your impressions on
  the thing.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/antherton-test_4811.png]\r\nYou can
  download the font at <a href=\"http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2586\">1001fonts.com</a>
  and make something with it if you like. I don't know what to do with it."

    overly-regular glyphs like the \"M\" (presuming there are others).\r\n3) Mind
    the too-short extenders (like the \"d\").\r\n4) Don't re-use parts, like you've
    done with \"a\"/\"d\".\r\n5) Some other stuff.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Wonderfully original.\r\nThe \"k\" is rather ambiguous; it could read equally
    well as a \"t\".\r\nThe \"t\" itself may be a bit too obscure, too, especially
    since it is taller than the other ascenders, instead of shorter as is usually
    the case, so I keep wanting to read it as an \"l\"."

    not sure how one could mistake the \"k\" for a \"t\". It isn't distinct, I'll
    grant you that.\r\n\r\nI suppose this whole thing is due for a revision. I made
    it years ago and I only had a vague concept of what I was doing. I'm learning
    a lot more here than I did in my past years of fumbling blindly through Fontographer."

    invitation, if you wouldn't mind sharing. The last time someone showed me what
    they used this font for it was for a church newsletter, and you know how those
    can go. "

  body: I adore this font and have used it for my etsy banner; "Mossmottle".  The
    only thing is the lower case "t" is rather cluttered looking on my banner, also
    Etsy blurs things a little too which is a bit frustrating, and I've deliberately
    made the word somewhat difficult to decipher by filling it with moss! :-) All
    in all though this is one of the best elaborate fonts I've ever seen. Thankyou
    so much for creating it![img:sites/default/files/old-images/msmtlshopbanner_5662.jpg]

  body: "How timely!\r\nI used it as one of my slides in my ATypI talk on Wednesday.
    I was trying to show that organicity does not depend on chirography. The parts
    where the strokes bifurcate (and trifurcate!) are especially relevant towards
    that end. Oh, and I set it green.  :-)\r\n\r\nSo again, Jason: thank you. Just
    one thing: some terminals are uncharacteristically stubby. I suggest cleaning
    up this baby a little bit and actually selling it. The original version could
    even remain as a free font alongside (which would additionally make it a nice
    illustration of how pay fonts are generally better).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I'll finally get around to giving this the adjustments it deserves, and actually
    start selling fonts and stuff that I keep promising to do. "

    design, and I'm happy to hear you will fix it up, and start selling it. If you
    upload a PDF I'll gladly take a closer look, and give some feedback.

  body: I've been digging through the curves over the last few days and what crap
    I have seen! Between what I've learned in the years since making it and the tools
    I now have available; boy howdy, what was I thinking back then! Revising this
    could take a while.
