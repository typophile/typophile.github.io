    thing I've ever said to my girlfriend was type-related. I told her that while
    her facial features are each individually beautiful, what really makes her gorgeous
    is the way they all play together; the way they interplay with the space between
    \u2014 like with type, how the counters and metrics matter more than the shapes
    of the glyphs themselves."

  body: "(Forgive me if this sounds too highfalutin; the language is more romantic
    than I intend but the thoughts are sincere.)\r\n\r\nType design is\r\na tool for
    discovering entirely new possibilities\r\nand\r\na tool for discovering the wisdom
    of the ways things have been done before. \r\n\r\nType design is \r\nan exercise
    in letting your impulses take shape\r\nand \r\nan exercise in growing to understand
    the needs of others whom your creations will serve.\r\n\r\nType design is\r\na
    reminder that consistency requires steady effort and discipline\r\nand\r\na reminder
    that unbending application of systematic thought leads to failure.\r\n\r\nIn these
    ways, figuring out how to design type strikes me as a microcosm of how to approach
    life."

  body: "LOL DEZCOM!\r\n\r\nfor me, my love of typography comes from the ability to
    artisticly express myself through typography and calligraphy. when i practice
    calligraphy, i can give for to thoughts ,straight away. it's a kind of drawing
    art for me, abstract in a way, more relates to pure form and meaning.\r\n\r\ni
    also think it's a great way to contribute to the hebrew culture's development
    (when designing in hebrew offcourse).\r\nletters for me have symbolic power, somehow
    a good form just lures you to \"enter\" in it and explore. letters have history.
    ancient letters call you to salvage them and be inspired by them.\r\na word can
    be worth about a thousand pictures (sometimes).\r\n\r\nthere was a female israeli
    poet named Yona Wallach,\r\nwhich wrote a poem about words, which i will write
    here in hebrew and english (adapted to english by the poet). i think this sums
    up my relationship with letters:\r\n\r\nLet the Words/ Yona Wallach\r\n\r\nLet
    the words act in you\r\n\r\nlet them be free\r\n\r\nthey will enter you inside\r\n\r\nmaking
    forms upon forms\r\n\r\nwill form in you that experience\r\n\r\nlet the words
    act in you\r\n\r\nthey will do in you as they please\r\n\r\nremaking new forms
    in the thing\r\n\r\nthey will make in your thing\r\n\r\nexactly the same thing\r\n\r\nfor
    they are the thing they make\r\n\r\nyou will understand that they revive\r\n\r\nfor
    you that experience and its meaning like nature\r\n\r\nbecause they are nature
    and not an invention\r\n\r\nand not a discovery for they are yes nature\r\n\r\nthey

  body: 'Abstract symbols taking on different meanings and connotations through variations
    in their physical form. Their form nonverbally affecting the meaning of something
    that intrinsically conveys verbal information. I guess, at some level, it''s the
    fact that symbols convey meaning verbally and nonverbally at the same time--the
    duality of meaning conveyed by glyphs--often conscious verbal meaning and often
    unconscious nonverbal meaning, simultaneously. The fact that it is all so utilitarian
    and practical at the same time belies the beauty of it all.  '

  body: "One fascinating thing about type design (typography is also cool, but not
    quite\r\nas exciting) is that, while I still think it's some sort of pinnacle
    of graphic design \r\nin terms of the clarity, simplicity, and detail precision
    that's needed, it's not just about designing pretty little shapes.\r\n \r\nSo
    you design a lettershape.\r\nYou put it in context, and it sits there.\r\nAnd
    then, it *says* something. Takes on a life of its own. Talks to its neighbors.
    \r\nLooks angry, or happy. Frowns, chirps, sings. And it interacts with the content
    \r\nthat it's helping to express, voicing it in its own tone: the one you formed.\r\n\r\nI
    find that's quite magical."
