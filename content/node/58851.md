  body: "It is so crooked I think someone did his own type-design maybe adapted a
    typeface like Bauhaus. It's definitely not a good typeface/logo. If you need anything
    like it search for geometric sans serif faces from the Bauhaus tradition. (check
    the curves of the \"a\" where it meets the stem they are nasty, the horizontal
    parts of the circles in the \"a\" are fatter then the vertical parts which should
    be the other way around for optical correction and don't get me started on the
    \"n\"). Believe me this type is painful to look at. (no offense to the designer
    it's just no good)\r\n\r\nIf you need more help? Let me know"
