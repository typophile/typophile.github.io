    thickened version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/amazone/"><strong>Amazone</strong></a>...

    an attempt to make it bolder like the sign, I don't want to apply a stroke.  Is
    there a better way of making it bolder in Adobe Illustrator?\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks!!\r\n\r\nKevin"

  body: Hmmm... that's a good question. If all you have to do is redraw their logo,
    then it might be a good idea to trace over the logo's letters to get skeleton
    strokes, which you can make thicker or thinner in Illustrator. Of course this
    means extra work for you, and I don't know if the project justifies it.
