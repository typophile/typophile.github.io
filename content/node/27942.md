body: "In most fonts, the \"questiondown\" character hangs way below the baseline.\r\nHowever,
  in some periodicals it sits on the baseline.\r\nIs this just a specialized display
  usage, or a general trend?\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, are typographers using: \r\n-
  baseline shift\r\n- the \"case\" (all caps) feature in OpenType fonts\r\n- custom
  fonts\r\n"

    shift.
