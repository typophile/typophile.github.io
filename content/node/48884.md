  is going to be used for a corporate identity, so anything with an equally wide range
  of weights will be useful.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "a little too slabby for me. apex new is pretty rugged in its own right, so
    i'm looking for something that will balance it out. i am really liking gulliver

  body: Yeah, OurType isn't cheap, but it's useful to look deeper to see what you
    get with even their basic OpenType fonts. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fresco_2_ot/">Fresco
    2 OT</a> ($210) includes roman and italic with small caps, and both lining and
    oldstyle figure sets for each. Add <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fresco_4_ot/">Bold
    and Bold Italic</a> for another $210 or get <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fresco_family_ot/">all
    five weights</a> for $737.

  body: "Yes, Ourtype is expensive, especially for our american neighbours :) \r\nBut
    with <em>Fresco</em> you get a typeface which is so versatile, a good investment
    for a lot of projects, not for one or two only. \r\nThere are a very few serif
    faces working gently in such a broadness (Dolly from Underware is another, but
    that is another topic).\r\n\r\nGreetings t.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nOne more \u2013 What
    about Proforma? http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Proforma/styles\r\n\r\n "

  body: "don't get me wrong, i'm all for paying for quality. i work at a small agency
    and this is going to be used for our new brand design, so it won't see any client
    use at all. plus things are a little tight now.\r\n\r\nthanks again for all the
    help. i checked out proforma, i'm worried it's a bit too delicate. we are using
    the heavier weights of apex, so i need something to keep up with it. dolly is
    not so bad after looking at it some more..."
