  body: "the closed i could find is a font called \"Fleurish script\", the lowercase
    characters are different (especially the \"u\"), but the Capital \"Q\" is right-on\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/script_4269.png]"

  body: Mista Mercury had a degree in graphic design. Add in a Zoroastrian family
    and you get these lovely covers. May be that it is all original, although I can't
    say for sure.

  body: "Awesome! Perhaps Mista Mercury has redone the lower case, or it could simply
    be apart of the Fleurish Script family? Or has been edited from that typeface,
    and titled under another name. \r\n\r\nA mysterie..\r\n\r\nThankyou again, very
    very much! \r\n\r\nHold on! Before you go away, where did you find it, I've just
    done a quick search, and have once again failed. Help!"

  body: "I'm guessing the lower case is from a different face altogether. Based on
    the fact that the letters don't quite connect yet overlap horizontally, they're
    probably Letraset or something similar. Poppl Exquisit has a similar 'u', but
    the x-height and angle are not the same as your sample.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
