body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI see lots and lots of geometric sans faces in magazines and advertisements
  around the world. Gotham and all it's relatives like Avenir Next and Neutraface
  2 seem to be quite popular among designers. \r\n\r\nAnd very often I see serif faces
  like Freight, Chronicle, and Farnham used with them.\r\n\r\nAnd new slab serifs
  seem to pop up here and there all the time.\r\n\r\nI imagine seeing a typeface trend.
  Am I wrong or right?\r\n\r\nBut even more I am wondering what will be the next big
  thing in typeface design. What kind of typefaces and combinations will we see in
  magazines in the future?\r\n\r\nI really look forward on hearing your thoughts on
  this. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nSami\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: You are right about the slab trend. But it's hard to say what the next trend
    will be. It will be whatever is new and interesting to designers and art directors.
