		<div class="commentbody">Scrapbooking is the new feng shui!  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also where all those stickers have gone -- the colorful and often textured cutesy stick-ons that were popular when my daughters were in junior high school 10 years ago.  <BR> <BR>Like Tiffany&#39;s friend, I&#39;m surprised fonts are being used. It&#39;s more common to use stickers based on themes &#40;Halloween, My 18th Birthday, etc.&#41;.

Besides the scrapbooking section, there are rubber stamps, wall stencils, etc.  You can play spot-the-Lithos-knockoff or wonder why letters with dots at the terminals are popular so long after Tekton&#39;s heyday.  I&#39;ve often wondered if any of these products were from licensed designs.  &#40;Any success stories?&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having difficulty understanding how a EULA would prevent someone from, say, collecting all the nearby lost cat posters to obtain Comic Sans in A-Z, then creating the scrapbooking dies from those.

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding the Starbucks/P22 Cezanne problem... <BR> <BR>My opinion is that as long as somebody purchases the the proper license for the number of CPUs/devices/whatever, I don&#39;t care how extensively they use it. In fact, I hope they use it as much as possible and as <i>visibly</i> as possible because in my experience there is a direct relationship between how often people see a font and how well it sells. Is it just a coincidence that P22 Cezanne is the best-selling P22 font at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bestsellers.html" target="_blank">MyFonts</a>?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point Mark, The main issue with Starbucks is that they did not purchase the proper license. The extensive use of the font for commercial products is actually a separate issue. <BR> <BR>&#62;Is it just a coincidence that P22 Cezanne is the &#62; best-selling P22 font at MyFonts? <BR> <BR>I don</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Richard, I agree with you about derivative works and getting the proper license to begin with.  <BR> <BR>What I meant was, I don&#39;t think I would try to sell a special &#34;large scale&#34; license. If somebody buys a font and uses it in some &#34;large scale&#34; way in, say, an ad campaign, I&#39;m getting more than the license fee from them already. &#40;Less tangible, of course, but a real value.&#41;</div>
