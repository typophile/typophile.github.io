body: "Ok, here it is. Any quick replies would be greatly appreciated: \r\n\r\nThe
  title of a poem/article normally appears in quotation marks, not italicized like
  a book title, and words in a foreign language within an English text are set in
  italics. \r\n\r\nI have an English text which mentions a poem with a French title.
  Should it be both italicized and in quotes, or do I leave off the italics?\r\n\r\nIt
  seems simple (I think it should be in both italics and quotes), but I am unsure
  all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nKristina"

  body: "Tim, actually redge was leading off from my suggestion to use guillemets
    in English and pointing out that the modern convention on the French side is to
    use more than thin spaces (between them and the quoted material). I based my suggestion
    of thin spaces on what I've seen in older books (see below), but I stand corrected
    on modern usage. (It's a good thing I only make fonts, and rarely actually  <cite>use</cite>
    them. :-)\r\n\r\nThe thing is though, if you've decided to go against English
    convention in such a big way in the first place by using guillemets, I think you
    can safely ignore the <cite>spacing</cite> conventions of the language you're
    borrowing the symbols from!\r\n\r\nBTW, as is quite often the case, a <cite>hybrid</cite>
    solution I feel can really click. Check out this setting from the Imprimerie Nationale's
    \"Origines de l\u2019imprimerie en France\" (A Christian) of 1901:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IN1901_53_6327.gif]\r\n\r\nSimply
    wonderful, and something that could serve for both English and French, especially
    in a publication featuring both. Also note the spaces around the... \"quotemets\".
    :-)  Although the setting is justified, it seems they're not full spaces on the
    \"insides\". Why the discrepancy between that sample and modern practice? I have
    to think it's <cite>quality</cite>: the IN was the height of it, while the last
    50 years was... not. I'd suggest that in the modern era the need to have <cite>some</cite>
    space on the inside coupled with the general unavailability of thinner spaces
    is what led to full spaces. A little bit like how many people -incorrectly- drop
    the accents from French caps.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I get it - makes sense.\r\n\r\n> do you think [quotemets] are intended as a Didone
    development of the guillemet?\r\n\r\nI don't think so, since other Didone fonts
    don't have them.\r\nIn fact I'd say that something with a ball-and-curl is less\r\nDidone
    than a chevron shape. BTW, I actually prefer to\r\nsee \"fake\" (straight) quotes

    and g\u2019s?\r\n\r\nThe one on the \"el\" is famous. It came about with the RdR,\r\nreputedly
    in order to help maintain the copyright given to\r\nthat design by the roi. But
    looking at what the \"el\" would\r\nhave looked at without it, I have to think
    there's a much\r\nmore pragmatic reason: clear differentiation with the \"I\"\r\nand
    the numeral 1.* In any case, it was taken up in some\r\nlater Didone designs of
    the IN, sometimes being flipped to\r\nthe other side (by Luce, I think).\r\n\r\n*
    Here's a scan from my hand-set Balzac printed at the IN:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CharlesX_6220.gif]\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe
    one on the \"g\", in fact that \"g\" as a whole,\r\nseems to have been an affectation:
    merely a way\r\nfor one of the Didot brothers to differentiate\r\nhimself from
    the others, as far as I understand.\r\nOne of Porchez's Didot fonts revives it
