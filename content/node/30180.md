  body: "Hi andrew,\r\n\r\nAccording to me, something is really disturbing in your
    overall form.\r\nmay be because of these things:\r\n\r\n>the relative proportion
    of the letters \"g\" and \"o\" is not correct to me. And your \"O\" neither looks
    caps, nor looks small.\r\n\r\n>three human figures looks they are not at their
    right place and there is no connectivity in the human figures and the letterforms
    you've used.\r\n\r\n> yes It does gives the feeling of a festival but its a bit
    unbalanced.\r\n\r\n>When the overall look of your logo is very humanistic and
    freehand, why the \"O\" is perfect circle?? As in the \"O' has a regular thickness
    whereas \"g\" does'nt.( Even the inner circle of 'g')\r\n\r\n>The stroke joining
    the \"g\" and \"O\" is forcefull to me.\r\n\r\n> It looks like you've made it
    directly on the computer..and thats without using any existing typeface.\r\n\r\nI
    liked the overall look of the logo..but still, there is a scope of further improvement.\r\n\r\n**\r\nAll
    these were based on my personal understanding..they may be wrong also..the final
    call must be taken by you.\r\n\r\nAll the best.\r\n\r\nsatya\r\nstudent, graphic

  body: "I agree the logo does suffer from inconstencies based on less time in preparatory
    sketch. But there is no reason to base it from existing type.\r\n\r\nThe counter
    of the O is a perfect circle. but so is the counter of the G. I think I may shrink
    the O's counter.\r\n\r\nI am not happy with the figures yet either. Connectivity
    to GO? It's family programming. \r\n\r\nI will work more after the holiday."

    the two taller ones are symmetrical, but on a closer look they actually are not.
    I would try to change this by either making the figures symmetrical or make clear
    that they are not. You should decide on that.  Could do this through changing
    the angle of the arms or playing around with the body heights a little bit. \r\n\r\nJo."

  body: I really like the way it turned out in the banners. Communicated the message
    clearly, looks good. I like the white gradient under the logo in the first banner,
    very clean. The only thing I severely dislike in the banners are the "Hear", "See"
    and "Do" colored drop-shadows. I think either a stroke, or no effects would be
    a lot clearer and more in line with the rest of the design. Love the 'go' now,
    though, I'd really stick with it.
