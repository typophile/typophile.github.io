<p>Following the responses on my earlier &ldquo;Primus&rdquo; post (see &ldquo;Primus: Please critique this font under construction&rdquo;), I made some major edits on this typeface.</p>
<p>One of the main edits was around using a more curvy flairing of the lower stems (following crossgrove and dezcom&rsquo;s feedback).</p>
<p>Also I updated all all the &lsquo;bowled&rsquo; letters of the lower case (b, d, p, q, e, c) as well as all the upper case.</p>
<p>The input I got was very helpfull and I would appreciate any further pointers!</p>

Good work! Much better! 
I wonder about the uppercase U? Does it need the flare? I think it probly is better without. It seems to create a bump where the U curve meets the stem at left?
I think Mr Nagel is right about the j and y tail as well. I would add that both j and y tails seem tocome too far left and pull the ballance rest of the glyph over to the right.  There is something out of sorts with the lc v and w to me.  They seem rotated a tad right.
Your s is lovely but I wonder if those beautiful terminals are the best choice to match the rest of the lowercase?</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments. I wasn&rsquo;t sure about the U either&hellip; One the one hand, it adds some quirkyness, but on the other hand, it may be inappropriately over the top. I think I may hold on to the flare on the right stem and make the left stem straight.</p>
<p>Good points on the j and y, I will give those tails a massage and a joint-crack.</p>
<p>I think the v and w need some balancing as you indicated. Their &lsquo;bottoms&rsquo; are offset to the left after operation flare.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on the lc s terminal? Originally, I had straight, i.e. pen-nib style serifs (see image), and after reading the thread on the development of &lsquo;Fejoia&rsquo;, I went for the &lsquo;brushy&rsquo; kind of serifs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Sebastian,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been so busy thinking about your feedback on my own design that I didn&rsquo;t realize you had one up here as well. I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot. Remember that I, too, am a beginner, and you shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily trust anything I say.</p>
<p>I think that one of the biggest sources of your lowercase&rsquo;s character (and I could be very wrong) is the juxtaposition of the the constructed pen-formed serifs and the swooshy, brushy terminals. To me, that&rsquo;s what gives your letters like k and x such a distinctive look. Because the brushy terminals are consistent throughout the lowercase (a c f j y, and to an extent the legs on k and x), I don&rsquo;t see a problem with them on the s, but I do think that they should be thickened up a bit, they look weak next to that r.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to fully commit to the brushyness, I might start to miss it in the uppercase. I only see it on the tails of the J and Q, but it has potential to be on the C, G, K, R, S, and the X. Maybe the reason that others want the brushy s to go is because it&rsquo;s not present enough in the other characters.</p>
<p>And, just for fun, I tried a little mixing and matching of your two s designs to echo the mixing of pen and brush that you do elsewhere. A little too weird, though.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/pixion_s_5446.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A few other notes:</p>
<p>c: the terminal on your c is too ball-shaped; I want it to be more like the one on on your a</p>
<p>e: this seems to tilt to the right because the bottom portion doesn&rsquo;t extend past the top. I know that your g leans to an extent too, but your c doesn&rsquo;t and I really want the c and the e to be consistent.</p>
<p>f: I love it, it creates such an interesting countershape over the following letter.</p>
<p>I hope that at least some of this was helpful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi David,</p>
<p>I appreciate you feedback!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, I think I settled on the coexsistence of the pen and brush type terminals. This is also used in a number of other typefaces as well (&ldquo;Quadraat&rdquo; is one that inspired me). I think that it may also be &lsquo;historical correct&rsquo; as I can imagine that in medieval times letters may have been drafted with a combination of media&hellip; (I am speculating here).</p>
<p>I have to play with some of the caps. One reason I limited it to lc is that I am affraid that things be become &lsquo;too playfull&rsquo;, and I want this face to have a &lsquo;classy&rsquo;, &lsquo;down to earth&rsquo; but open and energetic quality. Using the brushy terminals on the uc may take some &lsquo;seriousness&rsquo; away.</p>
<p>The hybrid s you drew is interesting. I see your point that the terminals are too light, so I made them larger and checked with the a, c, j, y etc. to see if they balance.</p>
<p>(Old / &lsquo;light&rsquo; s on the right)</p>
<p>Also the e got some straightening, although it still has a bit of the &lsquo;forward looking&rsquo; aspect. Also the c got some massage.</p>
<p>Here a test with some the touched letters.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Sebastian,</p>
<p>I like the changes you&rsquo;ve made, and I do see your point about keeping the brushy terminals as a special characteristic; overdoing it would take away some of the seriousness that you mentioned. I think that the c and the e are much better related now, and the terminal on the c matches the rest of the font.</p>
<p>The lc s is improved, I think, but I think it&rsquo;s lost some of its openness. Is there a way to keep the added weight on those terminals, but not close of the counterspace so much? It also feels like it&rsquo;s tilting backwards now; you can see that especially in the detail image you posted. The original s leans slightly forward (like your e and g) and your new one tilts the other way. I&rsquo;d try to go back to the original slant where the bottom terminal sticks out to the left of the top stroke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now, I think.</p>
