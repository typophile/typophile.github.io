  body: "I should clarify that this is probably from the old film type version, which
    uses the alternate E. Some weights no longer use the pointed A, either, but this
    was available in the film type version, shown in the 'Homage to the Alphabet'
    book from Phil's Photo. Some foundries are re-issuing old fonts with OpenType
    format, and including the alternate character set (ITC Avant Garde Gothic is a
    good example), but I don't know if ITC has done that with Serif Gothic.\r\n\r\n

  body: "For what it's worth, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/liberty/\">Liberty</a>
    has an E and A that are almost the same as the Serif Gothic alternate letters,
    and could make a fair substitute.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
