  (sic) Grotesk was released by [[h. berthold ag|Berthold]] in Berlin in 1898, according
  to their own literature. It was obviously based on faces already offered by other
  foundries, some of which were later taken over by Berthold. One of the contemporaries
  of AG was Royal Grotesk from Theinhardt. In Berthold\u2019s specimen booklet no.
  429, which was most likely released in 1954, Akzidenz Grotesk Mager (light) was
  still referred to as Royal Grotesk, in brackets. Berthold acquired a typeface in
  1908, (when they bought Ferd.Theinhardt) which they released as Akzidenz Grotesk
  Halbfett (medium). They kept adding weights, some of them from other faces, acquired
  from other foundries. Every foundry had a version of that type of face, more often
  than not available in a few sizes only. The original series remained quite divers,
  individual weights showing not much resemblance but in name. It was mainly a marketing
  and naming success. That only changed when they cut Series 57, and then Series 58,
  named for the years of release. These had some sizes (but not all) recut under the
  direction of G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange, who was their (freelance) artistic director
  at the time.\r\n\r\nGG Lange always claimed that Berthold had taken some AG weights
  and sizes from Popplbaum in Vienna, and that is supposed to account for the release
  date of 1896 or 1898. Popplbaum was not bought by Berthold until 1926. Berthold
  did take different fonts from all the foundries they bought (and obviously also
  made deal without buying a foundry) and rename them until they got a family together
  which still showed the original influences, sometimes even from size to size. The
  deals between foundries (by 1924 Berthold had bought 17 foundries, in Prague, Riga,
  Stuttgart, Leipzig, Moscow and St. Petersburg) have never been fully researched,
  and neither has the complete history of Akzidenz Grotesk been written yet.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
