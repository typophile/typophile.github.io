    Embedding: Service Bureau and/or printer, Limited Use (Client proofs), Commercial
    use (PDFs for purchase), internet use such as flash\r\n- Modifying: Format changing,
    platform changing\r\n- Users: How many users?\r\n- Location: Can it travel on
    my laptop as well as my desktop?\r\n- Product creation: Rubber Stamps\r\n\r\nHmmmm"

    a EULA model of selecting the desired items for the license, which would then
    change the price of the font license, work for you?\r\n\r\nFor instance, say a
    license is $35 per font, but you choose modifying as one of your choices in the
    licensing checklist, and that increases the font license to $50."

    place. What do I care where the fonts are, as long as it is within the limits
    of number of users purchased. AFA I'm concerned, people can use my fonts on the
    moon if they wish to do so.\r\nI also think restricting the number of printers
    is outdated, as a typical office often consists of a number of printers for different
    purposes. What I care is that people who *use* the fonts pay for them.\r\n\r\nI've
    been pondering for a while about the modification stuff. I can see the demand
    for it and generally I don't have any objections. However, I think I would like
    to keep some sort of control over it in as far that I would like to be informed
    if someone makes modifications. This for a number of reasons: retain certain control
    on quality, retain control on usage re workstations, support queries may come
    my way for work I have not done. \r\nI am thinking of changing our EULA to allow
    modifactions with the restriction that we are informed of all work done, and will
    have a copy of all work done to our fonts. We may also reserve the right to refuse
    the release of a modification if we feel that it is detrimental to our reputation.\r\n\r\nEmbedding?
    There are different opinions. Users demand embedding rights to make their life
    easier. Foundries are afraid it may slow revenue due to (enforced) sales lost.
    Other say, that in regards to embedding fonts should be treated like music broadcast
    via radio. Problem is that it is near impossible to police. And why have policies
    that you can't enforce, not only because it's logistically near impossible but
    because it may interfere with local legislation.\r\n\r\nWell, my two pennies.\r\n\r\nBruno

  body: ">Embedding means many things to many people. I can mean:\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of the OpenType specification (and TrueType before it) \"embedding\" relates purely
    to including fonts (or parts of fonts or converted fonts) within a <em>document</EM>
    file. \r\n\r\nOf course we don't try to define what a document is, and over the
    past few years font makers have tacked on additional restrictions/clarifications
    to their EULAs. For example some say PDF embedding is okay but Web embedding is
    not. Others say commercial documents (ebooks or subscription eperiodicals) require
    an additional license. \r\n\r\n> - embedding into an application\r\n\r\nIn the
    OpenType or TrueType sense this isn't \u201Cembedding\u201D and it's not covered
    by the embedding permissions in the fonts. We call this \"shipping\" a font, others
    may call it \u201Cbundling\u201D. Fonts can be either permanenetly (fonts folder)
    or privately installed (for the application's private use) - but either way 99%
    of font EULAs don't allow this. \r\n\r\nI think this is basic common sense, but
    there are gray areas - one being doc-apps, things that are mostly documents but
    have some application-like features - we call these doc-apps. An example might
    be an electronic document advertising a mortgage broker that has an in-build mortgage
    calculator. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

    to a different choice if the basic EULA doesn't suit me. I'm a very small outfit,
    buying fonts for the use of my home based business: restrictions and surcharges
    just put me of. I'd probably end up paying more at a foundry that had the rights
    I want in their basic EULA.\r\n\r\nIf the kerning pairs don't kern the small caps
    with the figures to accommodate Canadian postal codes, or if the f ligs haven't
    been added to the basic font in such a way as to allow them to function in InDesign,
    it's going to stick in my craw to pay extra for the privilege of making those
    adjustments myself. And let's face it, it's hard to tell about such thing from
    an online type tester, or even a PDF sample.\r\n"

    video game's code or if it's printed on a magazine page. Like so many other \"protectionist\"
    EULA clauses, the PDF embedding clause dates to a bad old time when it was easy
    as pie to pull the font code out of a PDF file. (This tendency to add another
    clause after getting burned by someone has been discussed before.)\r\n\r\nSi,

    seems to suggest \"the font\" is the actual OpenType font being embedded. http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fst
    - we know that some applications convert the font into another format, and respect
    the embedding permissions, some do not.  \r\n\r\nSpec doesn't define what a document
    is either. To be honest giving this some thought I don't think the spec should.
    That's not to say a future version of the spec shouldn't introduce embedding permissions
    for 'app embedding' \u2013 although I feel that for app embedding there won\u2019t

  body: "I've been wondering if the whole working model between type designer, graphic
    designer (GD) and client is the problem, and has to be changed. \r\n\r\nThe question
    has to be asked, \"Who is the customer for the font?\" \r\n\r\nCurrently font
    foundries look at the designer as the customer, and hence the restrictive (or
    not so) EULA. But the real customer is the GD's client. No? They are the ones
    that derive the most benefit from the chosen typeface. It seems to me that the
    model for the small independent type designer may be one of providing their fonts
    to the GD at no charge, and have the GD pay for the fonts every time they are
    used in a client's job, passing those costs off to the client. That way the customer
    (the designer's client) pays for using the font, not the designer. Sort of what
    was the working model when type shops set the type. The client was the one who
    always paid for the typesetting, with a markup added by the designer as the cost
    of capital outlay for the typesetting.\r\n\r\nNow this would require type designers
    vetting their potential partnerships with GDs and not all GDs would pass the vetting
    process. Legal agreements would be required. Frightening penalties but in place
    for non-compliance, etc. \r\n\r\nI know these agreements are in place with several
    foundries. Terminal Design has several of them with our long time GD associates,
    but I think this could be an interesting approach on a broader scale.\r\n\r\nGD's
    would gain the added benefit of not having to do any of their desired modifications.
    If a group of fonts was chosen for a project, and certain mods were required the
    GD contacts the type designer, and a cost for the work is agreed upon, these costs
    would be passed on to the client.\r\n\r\nThis may not work for large resellers,
    but it could be one of the selling points of working with your independent type
    design professional.\r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\n\r\nJames"
