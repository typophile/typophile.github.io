  body: "background on my claim of custom work: i have a friend who collects custom
    faces for commercial properties (suuuuper nichey). he gave me a pile of A+F customs.
    the one on top looks like it's from a family called Abercrombie Ivy, and the bottom
    looks to be Abercrombie Binder Stencil. i could be wrong.\r\n\r\nthe good news
    is that none of the custom faces are particularly special, they mostly look like
    things you can find lying around with some weathering applied.\r\n\r\ni'd go with
    the united collection if you're into the stencils. i bought it last year and have
    used it repeatedly ona  wide range of pieces. totally paid for itself."
