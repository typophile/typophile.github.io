  body: Seems like you could achieve that look using <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nq=1&amp;q=college">Freshman</a>.
    The thick letterforms of Freshman look like the total thickness of the letters
    in your sample. You&#39;d just have to cut in with a couple of strokes to make
    it look like this.

  body: The typeface also looks like Princetown, I am looking at a Corel spec book
    so it could be a knock off of something else.
