Create and then figure out how to produce it. Sorry If I sound harsh, I'm not, but you can make mistakes on paper but the computer is too final an instrument to be loose and creative on. This is just my opinion. Dan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While I don't think that a computer is not a creative tool, I feel that your logo &ndash; and btw, this isn't really a logo at all &ndash; looks like a wedding card. It has nothing to do with what the shop actually does, but also isn't ideographic enouugh to be abstract. It's just fancy, trying to be artful but ending kitschy.  <BR>Trash it and start anew. Think about an intelligent way of communcating the IDEA of fishing (please, no fishes or hooks or anything)&hellip; make it funny or serious or beautyful or ugly or whatever fits your need&hellip; but make it mean something.  <BR> <BR>This is just &hellip; empty, soulless. Devoid of an idea. Sometimes what you do can even be ugly as hell, but at least it has a soul. This however is just visual FX, bells and whistles (and even at that, it's not much fun to look at), without a core, without a message, without a heart.  <BR> <BR>Shy away from a GRAPHICAL solution and find some communicational SOLUTION first. The rest will follow all by itself.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for the comments&hellip; i guess i should have clarified what my objective was here&hellip; the shop opened up in the 30's and i am attempting to reference a visual language of that era relating to fishing. I have gone through tons of books and fishing magazines from the 30s and basically wanted to give this place a more modern feel, while referencing the past. This is where I am pulling for the type treatment: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19181.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>This is the &quot;logo&quot; i have been working on which would be on one side of the business card, while the logo type and info would go on the other. Again, I am attempting to reference the &quot;golden days&quot; of fishing by using the line art illustrations of that era as well as colors used in packaging. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19182.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>Do you still think I should totally scrap everything and start over? My teacher actually really liked the direction it is headed in, but if the general consensus on here is that this is totally wrong, I have no problem trying something different. Any suggestions on how I should approach it differently?  Thanks a lot.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jason, your scroll work and the beginnings of what your type is showing did remind me of this. It makes sense that something &quot;out west&quot; or &quot;in the west&quot; would still have hints of Art Nouveau or Arts &amp; Crafts at this late of period as trends travelled rather slowly back then. <BR> <BR>Your scroll work is more nouveau than your type selection however. <BR> <BR>I would suggest working some roughs up first. Decide on the general shapes you could work with, keeping in mind the words you want to use. <BR> <BR>It might be more interesting to break the text up like this: <BR> <BR>Hook, <BR>Line &amp; <BR>Sinker <BR> <BR>Maybe you could work with squares or circles. (general shapes) <BR> <BR>Please do work more roughs up. I'd be interested to watch the progression.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The fish on the old logo adds the&hellip;urp&hellip;flavor, so it works&mdash;kind of. Eliminating the fish reduces it to, as someone wrote, a wedding invitation feel, or a showcard feel (like in the silent movies), especially considering the ornaments you used. <BR> <BR>This might be one of those instances where you start from scratch. Keep in mind that fonts often have a &quot;feel&quot; to them&ndash;I think, at least. Can't think of any fishy fonts that aren't kitschy, so you might want to go with artwork and a neutral font, or at least a font that is brave enough to go with the artwork. I think you can find something that still evokes the feel of &quot;old-fashioned&quot; without being too formal. <BR> <BR>Plus, this was for an old catalog, not a fish shop sign. I think the two are entirely separate entities. What I would choose for one, I probably wouldn't choose for the other, unless a font was *just right* for both.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like it a lot more, and it has a New England feel to it, but I'm trying to envision this on a sign with the colors. <BR> <BR>Also, keep in mind that whatever you put a sign will probably also go on letterhead/business cards (color/B&amp;W), newspaper ads (B&amp;W&ndash;considering it's a store), possibly a yellow pages ad (B&amp;W), bags (color/B&amp;W), invoices (B&amp;W), billboards (?), packaging (?), and more. Unless you know for certain a logo will be for a specific use only, design for *all* the possibilities. You don't know what the client will do with it down the road. <BR> <BR>And the above logo use possibilities are why one generally **doesn't** charge a pittance for a logo design. Fifty dollars  (a figure I pulled out of my hat, but which is typical low-budget pricing) may seem like a lot of money to some people, but think of all the name/brand recognition the client will be getting from YOUR design as their logo is disseminated to the community. That recognition is worth money you should be getting a piece of. It's how you pay the bills and not have watered-down ketchup and crackers for dinner. <BR> <BR>Really like the name! <BR> <BR>Theresa</div>

		<div class="commentbody">maybe Im being picky, but shouldnt it read. <BR> <BR>&quot;Hook(comma)Line &amp; Sinker&quot; <BR> <BR>They are three seperate objects, no? Unless you have some sort of hook-line. Going against what HD said, I don't think the use of a hook would be so bad. <BR> <BR>I think that there should definately be all three items, not just one. I do like the idea of a treble hook, as opposed to a single hook. Maybe a tear-drop sinker would work better than the double eyed sinker you have displayed here. <BR>as far as the item you have in the middle of the picture above, well that looks like a life-float-tube-thingy (whatever those ar called). Make it look more like possible a bundle (and I mean more of a neat, round &ndash; maybe even tied off on the right and left side like they used to do &ndash; bundle)  <BR> <BR>With three abojects like this, you may experience a little visual instability, my suggestion around this is to reverse them out of boxes, similar to what you have here, but solid boxes. The boxes could be three different colors, that would work, but have the object reversed out (being white). <BR> <BR>The small caps I dont care too much for. The H,L,S glyphs look much to heavy. I might suggest a loosely &ndash; but not too loose &ndash; letterspaced all caps line. <BR> <BR>The ornaments on either side of your type, really don't do aything for me. It's too distracting. <BR> <BR>The type face itself is really not bad. I am not totally crazy about the ampersand though, but then again, that may just be personal opinion. <BR> <BR>Oh, and whats the deal with that middle arm on the E? It looks like it is about to reach out and molest that R. ;) <BR> <BR>Hope some of this was usefull.

		<div class="commentbody">wow thanks a lot everyone for all the comments/critisism. I have taken a lot of things said into consideration and decided to give it one more round to see if this design will hold any water&hellip; the line art is still not quite right, I will redraw it if i decide to stay with this concept, and change the line so it does not look so much like a life preserver ( i had a bad feeling it was going to read this way and was hoping someone would call me on it). Anyway, when i knock out the illustrations in white and keep the colors dark, it looks fairly decent in black and white (the boxes become dark gray with knocked out white), so I dont think that this will end up being a problem.  <BR> <BR>Im still wondering about the type.. is it still too plain and boring? I used Poppl-Laudatio and modified it very slightly. I wasnt sure how far I should take the type.. any suggestions? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19205.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>if the general consensus is that this route is dead and not worth working on, I will try to come up with something new tomorrow.

		<div class="commentbody">Try an older style typeface if you're trying to keep the 30's feel. The line illustration doesn't work. You need the line to come off the spool to read as line. The Illustrations currently say hook, spool &amp; sinker. Remove the comma after line its not correct. And if its sinkers make sure your illustration is sinkers not sinker. Consider how this would be done in one color. I agree with Kyle loose the ornaments on either side of the name. Its coming along, keep posting</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan I have to disagree, but only a bit. I think that the name works as it is, minus one 's'. It works as a cliche and is used that way as well. For example, &quot;I fell for that face, hook, line and sinker.&quot; <BR> <BR>Jason, I think you need to distill this down even more. As it looks, you have vector art and raster art. What if, instead of using those three graphics as is, you redraw them yourself. Or, at least free them from those boxes. I'm sad you are working with the scroll work. That is one of the things that could authenticate it a bit more. And the scroll work could also wrangle it all into one shape instead of several floating shapes. (Maybe) <BR> <BR>Crazy thought. What if the scroll work were the &quot;line&quot; and these three objects were some how &quot;on&quot; the line&quot;&hellip;. It is morning, I'll use that as an excuse if I decide later that this was a bad idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">ok ive been trying to get the &quot;line&quot; illustration to read more as a line&hellip; not sure if its getting there yet.  the problem is that i have to keep the line thick to read, but then it begins to look like rope. again these are really quick roughs just to get  a feel for what the final outcome will look like. I definetely like the illustrations in boxes better, and this will also allow me to give them a faded look like that of an antique lure box. Any suggestions where I should go from here? <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks again everyone for all the great feedback! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19284.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR>         <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19285.jpg" alt=""> <BR></div>

Not sure you need the distressed effect to make it look old. BTW it was nicely done! Keep that version (you might use it for print at somepoint). This should work in black and white too with no distressing. <BR>2. Yours has it's own personality, but I'm a little torn that the shape is a modified Brunswick Billiards :-) There are so many to choose from! Keep it if you want, but here are some more ideas: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19442.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Actual vintage angling logos: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19443.gif" alt=""> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19444.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>The South Bend one looks dated in a bad way. Shakespeare is looking dated in a good way. Yours looks dated in a good way. To dig these up I searched for collectibles online. You might try _________ collectibles + Logo at google. I put in fishing collectibles + logo, but try hunting, try appliances, try cattle feed (i dunno :-). Or try your own shape. One that works with the long wording. <BR> <BR>Good Stuff!</div>

Randy, yea I actually wasnt planning on using this Brunswick &quot;wannabe&quot; trademark, I just did a quick rough to see if i could make the style work for this project. I have plans of testing out different shapes/layouts, however due to time constraints of class (teacher wants roughs for class in about 2 hours) I am just working with what I have for now. I have made some very rough versions of how I envision the identity system to look. Its all 2 color (exept for the business card which is 2/1).

		<div class="commentbody">The blue border on the letterhead and other elements is a disaster waiting to happen. I've been in and around printing for almost 30 years and I can tell you the cutting machines will never give you the same width border on your collateral. Also if a printer took on the job they charge you 100% to 200% overs to make the design work. It would cost a fortune. Also I know that some people who have standard holders for business cards will toss out a card that doesn't fit there filing system. Another potential problem is if you have to photocopy, lets say an invoice if the background is too dark it will be a problem. There are asthetic design problems and then there are real physical and monitary design problems. Dan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jason - <BR> <BR>The pieces you have designed look great, but&hellip; <BR> <BR>Dan is correct about the issues of cost with your letterhead .  A printer would love to do such a job but in the &quot;real&quot; world it would cost a fortune to produce.  The envelope would also cause some printing issues and require a custom conversion - which again would be costly.  I'm not sure it would realistic to expect a small client pay for such luxuries, unless the &quot;high-end&quot; look was a desired result. <BR> <BR>I'm also assuming that in creating other pieces, like an invoice, the design would take into consideration photocopying or faxing - and still fit into your complete corporate identity. <BR> <BR>I don't buy into the the whole issue that a biz card MUST be 2 x 3.5.  Some of the most eye-catching and effective biz cards are unusual shapes and sizes.  Mine is almost square - and perhaps I do like to annoy some people with the unusual size/shape just a little bit.  These days a biz card seems to much more of  an introduction piece - and then the contact info is transferred to a PDA, a cell phone or a computer address book/data base.  Sticking to a standard size/format is just not the major concern it once was when designing a biz card. <BR> <BR>I've really enjoyed watching your progress on this project. <BR> <BR>- Jeff <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher <BR>Engineer of Creative Identity <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher LogoMotives <BR><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com">http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com</a></a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I ran across this looking for, well, I don't remember what I was looking for. Most likely something to do with aircraft design (I'm studying to be an aerospace engineer), but I was so awed with the progress on this design that I had to leave a comment. I though that first picture that was posted was really bland, but I saw it improve as I scrolled down, and the final one has such spirit to it. Very nice&hellip;</div>
