body: "One lookup many rules vs. many lookups \r\n\r\nI am developing an Arabic based
  font. As a type design I have stored dots separate form base glyph. The dots are
  joined to base glyph using \u201Cmark\u201D feature. \r\n\r\nThe base glyph of beh(U+0628)
  may have about 6 different kind of dots: three (1dot, 2dots, 3dots) below the base
  glyph and three above the base glyph to make the shapes of beh(628), yeh(6CC), peh(67E)
  and noon(646), teh(62A) theh(62B) respectively.\r\n\r\nBase glyph of seen(633) may
  have one kind of dot (3dots) above to make a shape of sheen(634) \r\n\r\nSimilarly
  base glyph of sad(635) may have one kind of dot (1dot) above to make a shape of
  dad(636) \r\n\r\nNow I have two solutions for positioning these dots using \u201Cmark\u201D
  feature. \r\n\r\nSolution 1: One Lookup \r\n\r\nName \u201CAboveDots\u201D\r\nPosition
  First----------Position Second\r\nBEH---------------------1dot\r\nSEEN--------------------2dots\t\r\nSAD
  --------------------3dots\r\n\r\nSolution 2: Three Lookups\r\n\r\nName \u201CAboveDots
  for BEH\u201D\r\nPosition First          Position Second\r\nBEH---------------------1dot\r\n------------------------2dots\r\n------------------------3dots\r\n\r\nName
  \u201CAboveDots for SEEN\u201D\r\nPosition First----------Position Second\r\nSEEN--------------------3dots\r\n\t\t\r\nName
  \u201CAboveDots for SAD\u201D\r\nPosition First----------Position Second\r\nSAD---------------------1dot\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  the 1st solution the combinations of SEEN \u2013 1dot, SEEN \u2013 2dots, SAD \u2013
  2dots and SAD \u2013 3dots are not required. Will this be effect the efficiency?
  \r\n\r\nIn the 2nd solution the Uniscribe may need to consult 3 lookup; would you
  please comment on the tradeoff among above two solutions?  Would you please suggest
  which will be more appropriate and efficient? Thanks\r\n  \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAtif\r\n\r\n\r\n
