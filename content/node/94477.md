    sounds similar to asking for a contemporary version of Cuneiform.\r\n\r\nYou might
    go to a site like MyFonts, look up Trajan or Lithos, and then see what they suggest
    as 'fonts like this' .\r\n\r\nHerb"

    Trajan and Lithos are two very different designs, each referencing very different
    styles and times.\r\nAll that said, you could be interested in the work of Sumner
    Stone (http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/stonetypefoundry.html)"

    wasn\u2019t directly inspired by ancient Rome, but the capitals do look a bit
    like a crisper \u201CTrajan\u201D, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after."

    qualities, but a more contemporary cut. \r\n\r\nSumner Stone just might be perfect
    - thanks!"
