  What configurations are needed to do a good job? I am guessing that I need certain
  OS' ( Vista+Xp no?) & certain apps ( Indesign, Quark Word no? ) to test in. What
  do you think? Obviously intended use plays a role too - screen fonts vs. those for
  print etc. For now I am thinking specifically of print. Extra points for:\r\n\r\n-
  testing models that may fall short of the ideal while still doing solid job!\r\n-
  dealing with anything new & relevant resulting from the Vista OS\r\n- Windows centric
  type utlities\r\n"

  body: I didn't really read your earlier Linux thread, but testing platforms really
    depend on the type of fonts your making (any complex script fonts?) and the type
    of customer (regualr user, graphic designer, ISV, OEM...)

  body: "I thought that the FontLab presentation by Phinney and Twardoch at Typecon
    '06 was very interesting. They spent some time describing the process for naming
    font families so that they appear as expected in Windows applications. The reason
    I mention this, is because style-linking and family naming seem to be major causes
    of font defects on Windows. Even when fonts are functioning as intended some users
    may be confused/annoyed by style-linking. For example in Word, there is no easy
    way to tell if you're using a real face or simply styling the text. \r\n\r\nThe
    easy solution, of course is to make sure you're testing with applications customers
    use. Also, it is good to have an open chanel of communication  back from customers.
    Many users will blame the application first. It may take several users before
    someone realizes that the font itself is defective. "
