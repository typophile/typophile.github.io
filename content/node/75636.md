  versions of the New York subway map. The design below is a small portion of the
  map by calligrapher Bernard Maisner. \r\n\r\nThe article has an interactive feature
  that lets you download a subway map template, add your own type and artwork, and
  then upload it back to the NYT for possible inclusion in their gallery of submissions.\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/235kwzl[img:sites/default/files/old-images/map_image_6163.jpg]"
