    do people always have to put things into a box). Voila, the overall appearance
    will be much more elegant.\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n"

    look ive just discovered photoshop'. Lets get to the point 'ITS CRAP!'\r\n\r\n
    \r\n\r\nIf he wants to keep it...why is he asking for a designer to do a new one?
    classic arrogance. Its one thing for the client to steer things to their liking,
    it is afterall for them...but quite another to insist they know your job better
    than you.\r\n\r\nyou dont go telling a carpenter how to make a table do you.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nwhat
    works in your favour, is the guy prob knows nothing, and is just trying to 'be
    in charge' so some tact is needed. just do a design, use the copy, but not the
    design hes supplied...and tell him youve re-worked 'his' design, keeping the flavor
    of the original logo etc etc...just butter his ego...\r\n\r\nthats whats really
    required.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What a nice project to given!\r\n\r\nI guess it's a little late in the day.
    But if you're still on the project, it might be an idea to exaggerate the contrast
    in sizes even further so that Dove Cottage and Wordsworth are far more prominent.
    That and course all those things Seb suggested.\r\n\r\nG'luck! "
