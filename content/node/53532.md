body: "Last summer while leaving Barnes and Noble I was stopped in my tracks by this
  book cover because it reminded me of pop artist James Rosenquist, who's work I love
  after seeing an exhibit of his at the Guggenheim back in 2003 (he also has a piece
  at NOMA). The illustration is by [[http://www.jacobmagraw.com/|Jacob Magraw-Mickelson]]and
  the cover was designed by [[http://www.rodrigocorral.com/|Rodrigo Corral]]. I was
  even more excited when I picked it up and realized it was by Chuck Palahniuk who
  wrote Fight Club, which is also a great book with a great cover and a great movie.
  Which the thought of always brings me to daydream about Brad Pitt...\r\n\r\nRant

  body: "The Harry Harrison cover is fantastic -- a very appropriate application of
    photo to content.\r\n\r\n[Going off-topic a bit] Rodrigo Corral has designed some
    really excellent covers for Chuck Palahniuk, but as for the books' content...
    I thought <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Diary-Novel-Chuck-Palahniuk/dp/0385509472/ref=ed_oe_h\"><em>Diary</em></a>
    was poorly written and thought-out. I'd like to read <em>Fight Club</em>, though,
    beacuse I've seen the movie (and liked it)."

    the\r\nsagmiester is great since you can constantly \"switch\" the covers out...if
    \r\nyou don't own that one (sagnmiester) do get it!"

  body: "I agree the Harry Harrison cover is absolutely beautiful, though I haven't
    an idea of the content. \r\n\r\nI didn't read Diary, but I'll have to check that
    one out. Warning: the Fight Club book is a bit different from the movie, but an
    excellent read and brings out a lot of interesting sociological ideas about the
    condition of materialism, the work environment and alienation.\r\n\r\nI'll definitely
    look in to purchasing the Sagmiester interactive book. \r\n\r\n--\r\nazu"
