If I can paraphrase, how you believe the weight of individual glyphs need to dance around, how you don&rsquo;t want it too look even, but not predictably uneven either. You talk about this at about the 20 minute mark in the video.</p>
<p>I wonder if the is any text out there describing this that you know of, I am very interested in this and would like to learn more.</p>

Could you correct the spelling on my name?  :)  I did write a similar essay [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/11/02/reviving-caslon-part-2-readability-affability-authority/|Reviving Caslon, Part 2]] over at ilovetypography.com .</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see in the ilovetypography essay some of the visuals that illustrate my point about the need for both even rhythm and for variation or &lsquo;dance&rsquo; (as Hrant has put it) that both gives a &lsquo;signal&rsquo; to the eye of what letter it is, and keeps the face lively. I re-used some of those visuals in my slides in the talk.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d be happy to go further into it, if you have further questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You can get the even rhythm with sans, but the &lsquo;dance&rsquo; part of it seems me to be more difficult. With seriffed fonts you have both the serifs and the thick-thin contrast to play with. This gives you a lot of scope to &lsquo;cheat&rsquo; this way and that to give more variety to the characters, so they have even color, but are quite varied. That seems to me more difficult with a sans. My feeling is that sans in general do not do so well in extended text, and this may be why. There are other issues, but that&rsquo;s a start. But not having done a sans yet, I&rsquo;m not the best one to say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thing is though, because sans are often so geometrical and have such straight lines and less polymorphism between glyphs, sans fonts could use this effect a lot more than serif fonts do.  In fact I&rsquo;m working on a face right now that is made up of all straight lines, and not straight lines so short that a sequence of them may be mistaken for curves, but straight lines that are meant to be seen as straight.  I find making the bottom of the O for example, slightly thicker than the top seems to take on this effect.</p>
<p>I was hoping perhaps you came across this idea not from studying other typefaces, but perhaps read about it in some book somewhere.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve learned about type first from reading my Uncle Ben Lieberman&rsquo;s old book, Types of Typefaces, which sparked my interest in it. Then from Tracy&rsquo;s Letters of Credit. Most of all by opening and comparing typefaces in FontLab, and then by drawing, drawing and comparing the effects of different variations of Caslon. And then from the folks at Font Bureau, especially David Berlow and Jill Pichotta.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no way to really learn type design other than by drawing, looking and comparing over and over and over again.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I don&rsquo;t think Serapion is a good text face, because it&rsquo;s color is too uneven. You can get variety by doing uneven color, easily. To get variety while also getting even color to me is the challenge. Storm is a good designer, but to me this one is not a success. Large it&rsquo;s ugly as well, if you ask me.

		<div class="commentbody">Well I&rsquo;m really a display face maker, so I suppose we automatically look at faces differently from eachother to begin with.  However, have you ever actually read anything printed at text size in Serapion?  I haven&rsquo;t printed anything out with a laser printer or anything but when looking at it at 10 pt in Coreldraw, it&rsquo;s eccentricities seem to fade away a lot, and it actually seems quite comfortable to read, IMO, anyway.  I don&rsquo;t know how in the world Storm made that way off center counter in the g work, but to me, somehow, it seems to.</div>

<p>When it comes to display type, subjective taste plays an even bigger role than text type, which is more constrained by readability demands. For example, I recognize the Victorian stuff, which tends to extremes, can be good, but I tend to like more classical taste. But I do like art deco. Whatever the style, though, I think visual coherence of the design is important. Any style is better than no style.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ryan, checking out Storm&rsquo;s site, your design looks a lot like Storm&rsquo;s Lexon. Biblion, which is his earlier and similar design was innovative in the way it succeeded in remaining legible at very small sizes, as I remember. Lexon is a bit less weird but still intended for reading at small sizes. Anselm is a design of his that is dialed back still further, and more traditional.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any of these as good display faces, which you say is your goal, but this is a matter of personal taste. To me their quirkiness doesn&rsquo;t have the charm of a Cooper Black or much of Goudy&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>In the case of your design, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as well executed as in Storm, as, for example, the terminal on your r is too light in comparison with the a s c  and the design of your m and n are not as harmonious with the rest of the design as in Storm&rsquo;s Lexon.</p>
<p>I think your design here is too close to Lexon for comfort. I think you should take what you&rsquo;ve learned on this and try to get a new design idea that is less close to Lexon. Also I&rsquo;m sure there are others who like these Storm designs for their aesthetic, and those who like them can probably give you better guidance on executing it well. Generally speaking, if you are going for quirky in a display—and that can be very successful—it should have cuteness or scariness or some other mood going for it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well I figured it looked like Storm, but I didn&rsquo;t see Serapion when I checked the Storm site, and forgot about your earlier post. And I wrote the above before looking at the print out, because you said you wanted to do a display type, and I thought this was yours. I did look at the print-out later and was going to write that it is readable small, but looks kind of clunky and clotted also. I do still think it&rsquo;s worse than the other designs I mentioned. I&rsquo;m impressed at how Biblion works very, very small, but aside from that I don&rsquo;t see the use of it. But I don&rsquo;t like any of these related designs aesthetically. Yes, I think the whole lot of them are ugly.</div>
