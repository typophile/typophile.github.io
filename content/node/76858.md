  and the theme is about peace, hope, faith, etc.\r\nfor the holidays and I am creating
  the words to be the shape\r\nof a gift box, so I am trying to decide what kind of
  typefaces\r\nI should look for. There is one called Lobster I like and others\r\nsuch
  as Rosewood fill and Mrs. Eaves Bold. I have other slab\r\nserifs and a few scripts,
  but nothing jumps out at me. \r\n\r\nWould any of you have some suggestions? Thanks!!\r\n\r\nbonnie"
