body: "Does Loud Music Damage Your Hearing Cells?\r\n\r\nOne of the well known risk
  factors for hearing problem is loud music from earphones. How noise damages nerves
  in the ear remained unclear until University of Leicester researchers has uncovered
  the answer.\r\nMyelin sheath is a protective shield that maintains the integrity
  of the nerve cells that transport sounds from the ear to the brain in the form of
  electrical signals. Exposing the ear to loud sounds, over 110 decibels, can causes
  striping of these cells from their protective shield resulting in disturbance of
  the transported electrical signals and eventually hearing problem.\r\n\r\nfor more

    loud music does, indeed, cause hearing loss. As well as sixteen Fender speaker
    cabinets\u2026completely blown.\r\n\r\nOTOH, myelin\u2014both around the nerves
    and in the white matter of the brain\u2014can be repaired and added to with a
    judicious application of precisely the right amino acid and vitamin. Really."
