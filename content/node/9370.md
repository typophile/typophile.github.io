  digital &#34;pattern&#34; to use as a background image. <BR> <BR>I have one example
  of such a pattern at the website listed below. Is there a specific name for these
  types of patterns? Is there a website or online resource that contains links to
  such patterns? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your help, <BR>David <BR> <BR>&#40;The
  pattern is included at the bottom of the page, in a small strip: scroll all the
  way down and you&#39;ll see it. Thanks!&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.bauhaussoftware.com/products_mirage_LP.php"

  body: I have been wondering the same thing; I used to have some links in my browser
    where I was studying, but we had a system changeover and five minutes before I
    asked for all my preferences and stuff back, they deleted it. I&#39;ve been searching
    on and off ever since. <BR> <BR>Bastards! <BR> <BR>This thread, however, has just
    inspired my to create some of my own! My little brother wants some. <BR> <BR>So,
    I second your motion, David. <BR> <BR>Where can we find these?

  body: Dav&#40;id&#41;, <BR> <BR>I love the damask wallpapers!  Those are really
    neat.  What I don&#39;t like about many resources is that they want links on your
    site, and I don&#39;t usually like having links so I end up not using the resources.
