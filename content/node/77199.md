body: This is from a book printed in the UK in the 1950s. It's being reprinted (from
  existing artwork) with a new preface so I'd like to match the face as closely as
  possible. Identifont and WhatTheFont both failed to come through, so now I throw
  myself on your mercy. Any (and all) suggestions gratefully received!
