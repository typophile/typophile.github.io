    even [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/craw-modern/|Craw Modern]] with a little
    editing.\r\nMany logos start with a font and then get tweaked to make them specific
    and unique.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/englische-schreibschrift-bq/|Berthold
    Englische Schreibschrift]] for the script."

  body: "Hello Viviane,\r\n\r\nYou are right about the script. The termianls (ball),
    stroke weight, and lowercase \u201Cr\u201D are different.\r\n\r\nAs for the wordmark
    TOCCA, this is Cochin that has been vertically compressed and the tracking extended
    (perhaps similarly, Craw would otherwise be an anonymous modern if were not for
    its extended appearance)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tocca_5580.jpg]"
