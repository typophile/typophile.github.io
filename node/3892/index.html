		<div class="commentbody">That's Adobe Sans, the horrendous substitute font which ATM uses whenever the original fonts are not available on the user's computer system. This allows the user to read and print documents which feature those missing fonts. It's a chameleon-like typeface that uses Multiple Matser technology to match the widths of the missing font in order to take up exactly the same amount of space. It finds those widths in the &quot;ATM font database&quot;, a file in your System folder that includes the widths tables of almost every single typeface in the Adobe Type Library. So in fact this could be any typeface.</div>

And Anonymous, don't get me wrong, the following rant is not aimed at you. Don't get caught in the crossfire. <BR> <BR>I mean, everywhere I look I keep bumping into Adobe Sans or Adobe Serif: on menus, in magazines and newsletters, on wrappers, on huge friggin' billboards&hellip; even on my yoghurt pot at breakfast and on the jars of my favourite brand of rice sauce. Don't all these designers, art directors or whoever they might be have eyes and see that the typefaces they so carefully specified were missing when they output the files and came out all wrong? I kid you not, within the space of a couple of months we received two logos with Adobe Sans converted to outlines. Which is doubly ironic because converting your fonts to outlines is exactly what you do when you want to avoid having your typeface being replaced by ATM! Aaargh, this is driving me NUTS! (wheeze wheeze pant pant) <BR> <BR>Okay, okay&hellip; <BR> <BR>I'm calm now. <BR> <BR>This was my little Doctor Jeckyll and Mister Hyde episode. <BR> <BR>It won't happen again. <BR> <BR>Excuse me for shouting. <BR> <BR>I really had to get this off my chest. <BR> <BR> <BR>P.S.

		<div class="commentbody">Just a quick one before I sign off: automatic font substitution combining Multiple Master technology and font width tables was a stroke of genius, and a very important invention given the increasing importance of the Portable Document Format. But I fear in the process Adobe spawned a monster, and it's out there and can't be undone&hellip; Of course, the fact that the typefaces continually change their appearance like some kind of virus makes it very difficult to identify them, even to the trained eye, so I guess this explains why they keep popping up everywhere. <BR> <BR>P.S. If anyone wants more information on font substitution in ATM check Adobe's <A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5070.SupportATM.pdf" TARGET="_blank">  Support Knowledgebase document</A>, under section 4, page 11. It's pretty rudimentary, but it's the best I could find.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had a really tough time trying to create this sample, so excuse me if the italics aren't included. I was getting all these weird results after deactivating and removing the fonts and reopening the files: QuarkXPress substituted Gill Sans with Geneva, Adobe Illustrator used Adobe Sans for the regular weights but Helvetica Bold for the bolds, Acrobat used Adobe Sans but didn't slant the italics, Photoshop gave me Times for some lines, and InDesign is just too damn smart: it highlights all missing fonts with a thick red rule (oooh I love that program! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> ). The system doesn't seem to work that consistently, and I suspect it's the programs themselves that have their own substitution rules which clash with the ATM system. <BR> <BR>So below is the result. Just keep in mind that the italics are slanted versions of the same faces. I know it's quite a large file, but it seemed a bit silly to make a sample of 12 pt type at screen resolution. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/3083.gif" ALT="AdobeSans_AdobeSerif.gif"></div>
