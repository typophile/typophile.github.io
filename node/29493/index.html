<p>Stencil font design offer great possibilty of creating new approaches. I think we can draw stencil letters without just cutting the letter forms or adapting them to the stencil technology. As stencil cuts add complexity to letterforms, offer new vast drawing possibilities.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think?! :)</p>
<p>I have been working on a stencil font called Forma, in wich the interruptions have a connection with the basic structure of the letters.</p>

<p>One of my type design students -a graffiti artist, appropriately- did a unicase stencil font. I tried to guide her as much as I could, and I think the results were interesting and useful, but I have to admit to having felt a little bit lost! More thought is needed, all around.</p>

<p>I think that sentence defines something about typography nowadays. Much of the contemporary typographical work is made of digital stylistic exercises, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree.</p>
<p>The stencil aproach could be looked at, just as a esthetical choice in a stylistic exercise, or as a way to make real stencil letters with a new style.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Forma has very thin support bars, and many are positioned such that the counters could easily be torqued out and broken away, most obviously in the A, B, D, P, O, Q, and R. In the lower case, the a, b, d, e, g, o, p, and q have the same problem. The curved support bar of the A is unusual, but not prohibitive depending on the method and material of construction, but most ways I can think of it it only serves to further weaken the bar.</p>
<p>A stencil made with this font would work, but it could be easily damaged and is therefore not suitable for repeated use. It would depend on the material and size of the stencil and the conditions under which it is used. The counters are attached, but in such a way that they&rsquo;re still floppy, and that is dangerous when designing a sturdy, functional stencil.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to put together a little image of some other stencil fonts, like Freeform 721 and Glaser Stencil and whatever else I can find so we can further the discussion. It seems most if not all stencil fonts take some liberties with what I imagine stencil engineering to be.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rui,</p>
<p>If we do want to distinguish between a design that can be translated into a reusable stencil, and a stylistic exercise, then I think your design is the latter. The locations of the &lsquo;interruptions&quot; as you call them are less than optimal if you consider making and using a stencil from it. Some letters might need to be completely redesigned if your real goal is reusable stencils.</p>
<p>I have made stencils, and some were only intended to be used 2-4 times and then thrown away. In one case I made a house number, and held the small counters to the rest of it by taping long pieces of hair across the whole thing (my sister has very long hair). So you could even make a stencil that doesn&rsquo;t look like one. For that matter, silkscreen printing is essentially a stencil held together by a fine mesh of &ldquo;hairs&rdquo;, or the thin threads of the screen.</p>
<p>But what is your goal, and what are your real constraints? If the design isn&rsquo;t meant to ever be translated into physical materials, then why bother? You could make a font with interruptions all over, or one with dents and bumps, or&hellip;. If the real constraints of making a functional stencil aren&rsquo;t there, then why are you doing it? If you want to play with that style, I say make it work for real. The big challenge is making it work and look good.</p>
<p>Finally: To see if your design works as a stencil, print it on heavy card, take a knife and cut it out. Spray paint or sponge paint something with it. Does the card curl up? Do the links dissolve from the moisture in the paint? Are they too delicate to withstand blotting or brushing? Use plastic. Does the paint get under the counters? There are a number of other concerns with designing real stencils that might be more interesting than any of our theories. What about trapping?</p>

<p>I suppose my intention was to make a print font with style rather than a real stencil font, although when I was working on in it i was imagining it to be cuted on a iron plate.
After releasing it I started questioning my self whether thise characters were just nice drawings  with a light stencil touch (i don&rsquo;t know if you agree), or if this font could be considered as a stencil font. That is why I wanted to bring to discussion &ldquo;the stencil aproach&rdquo; and it is making me want to add a new version to forma with real functional concerns.</p>

<p>Virtual exactly means that there can be no such things as &ldquo;too thin&rdquo; and &ldquo;broken away&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s a lot of fertile ground between making anything mean anything and being hopelessly draconian. The potential physical merit of a stencil font is completely pointless. So a given one might be unsuitable depending on the construction material, the type of paint, etc.? What else is new about fonts?!  :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting work being done using stencils. Multi-colored graffiti, signage, tags and other applications that call for inventive letters and images cut from some material. Getting them to work is the fun part, then using them to mark or communicate is the purpose. I&rsquo;ve seen elaborate murals made only with stencils, as well as political graffiti. Portable, quick, no need for tape.</p>
<p>Digital outlines don&rsquo;t have the same constraints at all, so why bother thinking about &ldquo;stencil&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s just a stylistic choice? I don&rsquo;t know why there are so many monospaced fonts out there either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attaching an idea from a typophile letter design challenge; I think the idea was design a stencil alphabet and use it. I didn&rsquo;t get around to using it, but this is a scan of the actual stencil.</p>
