  body: "CORRECTION (edited above):\r\nI'm not looking for shears that are non-perpendicular
    (implicitly to\r\nthe \"stroke\"), I'm looking for shears that are non-horizontal/vertical.\r\nSo
    perpendicular is even OK - although not required. (You might have\r\nfigured all
    this out already...)\r\n\r\nJ\xFCrgen, Finnegan is a valid suggestion (with no
    need to apologize).\r\nSupergrotesk: nope, the shears are generally horizontal/vertical.\r\n\r\nA
    good example of what I'm looking for is H&FJ Whitney.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the terminals are cut at \"funny\" angles, like Profile. Quay Sans is a great
    font (takes after papa Syntax), it's \xFCber-humanist, and it even has flares,
    but it doesn't really qualify.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    That has some of the most arbitrary lower case terminals you'll ever see. Check
