  body: 'Thanks! I was looking at Helvetica Neue Black, but it does seem to be Extended
    (Compressed by 75 and 80%). I think the O, C, and M were redrawn (or borrowed
    and adapted from something like Agenda). Thanks for the help! '

  body: Helvetica wasnt created until 1957, maybe it's a good place to start but I
    wouldnt say the sample is Helvetica Black. The extended version of Helvetica didnt
    even come along until later.

  body: "Josev, I suspect it's custom lettering. Either way were are the three samples
    overlaid. It shows Helvetica Neue Black Extended (condensed to 80%) on top, the
    two samples overlaid, and the original beneath. It's a pretty remarkable match.

  body: 'It probably was hand lettered, OR it''s based on an earlier font. I guess
    the question is what are you trying to achieve? To recreate the logo? Or to find
    the original font for other uses? '
