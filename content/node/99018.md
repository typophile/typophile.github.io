  theft on the Internet. (Paint.Net is good for this, and free.) Someone warned me
  not to use MS fonts or I'll lose my rights to the images. From what I've read, that
  does not sound possible. What do you think of this comment?\r\n\r\n\"Do not watermark
  using Microsoft\u2019s \u201Cfree\u201D fonts, at that conveys maximum legal copyright
  in the \u201Cderived works\u201D to them.\"\r\n\r\nIf that's true, then I'll need
  to find something plain and simple to substitute for Arial."

    put their authors' and publishers' rights in danger.\r\n\r\nHowever, Microsoft
    Windows is sold to people for home and office use, not as an instrument of publishing,
    and the possibility of some weird stuff in the licence agreement can't be totally
    eliminated.\r\n\r\nIt is just recently in the news that some of the services competing
    with Flickr (but not Flickr itself!) are now arrogating to themselves rights to
    the images they host."

    to major corporations and is loaded with the same fonts under the same EULAs as
    everyone else and they publish tons and tons of material using the same software
    and fonts. I don't believe it can possibly be an issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nuh...  <\\:o)
    \r\n\r\nin case that sounds snarky.\r\n\r\nThe new terms of use agreement that
    Instagram released are to bring them into harmony with their new owners, Facebook
    - by permitting advertisers to access to your images for the purpose of selectively
    placing ads next to them and using the meta data to target you and you friends
    with crap they think is relevant to what would appear to be your interests based
    on what you post. The advertisers Instagram really do not want our pictures of
    our kittens. "

    try to sell them under another name as your own, and things like that.\r\n\r\nFor
    the other comments, yes, I think that it's silly for the guy to have told me that
    I'd lose rights to my photos for using MS fonts. Especially Arial."

    I do know, however, that OSI-approved licences do not limit usage. Exactly why
    did you think Mr. Impallari always says: "When in doubt, pick something OFL''d"?'
