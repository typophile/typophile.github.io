    Seems to be a very plain script doctored with flourishes. I also had no success
    in finding a similar plain script. Any suggestions as to a plain script?\r\nDon"

    most distinctive earmarks. Narrow it down to plain scripts with something similar
    and that at least would be something.\r\nDon\r\n"
