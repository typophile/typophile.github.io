body: Hey all! i'm in desperate need of finding the script font on the jersey of the
  attached photo. I'm making some graphics for them and they're being sticklers about
  keeping that look but they don't know what the font is. I'm having difficulty finding
  a script font that's upright AND doesn't haven't a loop in the 'l". I'd greatly
  appreciate your help! Thanks!
