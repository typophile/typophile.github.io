body: This font looks a lot like Adobe Garmond, but it definitely isn't as the "a"
  appears to be very similar to the Caslon "a," the uppercase P is connected, and
  the uppercase T has no upward pointing serifs. In addition, the overall appearance
  of the font has more of a transitional flair like Caslon. I have been going crazy
  trying to figure out what this font is, and even Identifont, my normal font identification
  method, has failed me. Any help is greatly appreciated.

      to happen to anyone who uploaded an attachment.

  features as well.
