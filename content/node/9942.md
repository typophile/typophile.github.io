  body: '&#34;Liana&#34; is not an original font, as I find is true of many of the
    ParaType fonts. This is an old photo-type that has been called &#39;<a href="http://www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=19848&amp;issingle=yes"
    target="_blank">Lady Dawn&#39;</a> &#40;Type Revivals - in FontBook&#41;, <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000079"
    target="_blank">Mr Lackboughs</a> in the Veer revival of the Bluemlein Collection,
    &#39;Blue Skies&#39; in the Phil&#39;s Photo &#39;Homage to the Alphabet&#39;
    book, &#39;Lady Script&#39; &#40;Solotype, p. 96&#41;, and also &#39;Lucy Script&#39;
    &#40;Intecsas/David Rakowski&#41; as well as many other names elsewhere on the
    web at shareware/freeware sites. <BR> <BR>This may not matter to you, of course,
    but I think the history of this oft-revived font, which ParaType says was based
    on &#39;Lainie&#39; of Soft Horizonts &#40;still another alias for this script&#41;,
    shows how some foundries will never need to design an original font.'
