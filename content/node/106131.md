  body: "This design has also been revived in a commercial font <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jawfonts/adage-script-jf/\">Adadge
    Script JF</a> by Jason Walcott, which is perhaps more polished. AFAIK Lauren Script
    was produced as an original work previous to Adage Script and thus is in no way
    a rip of Adadge script. No info on the pre-digital original. Perhaps a photo lettering
    era design?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AdageScript_5346.jpg]\r\nDon"

    now.\r\n\r\nMike Allard created some of the earliest digital shareware revivals.
    I don't believe he created any original designs - but I might be wrong.\r\n\r\nEdit
    - It wasn't a Filmotype face."
