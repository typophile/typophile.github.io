  this wonderful script? This image was taken from the <em>Suitcase Type Foundry Open
  Type Collection Catalogue</em> designed by Tom\xE1\u0161 Brousil. Unfortunately,
  <a href=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/\" title=\"Suitcase Type Foundry\">Suitcase</a>
  doesn't seem to offer the script on their website&mdash;at least not currently.
  If it helps, I found the image <a href=\"http://www.typosemestr.cz/suitcase-type-foundry-open-type-collection-catalogue\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nKen"

    by promotional art in the 1960s. Thanks to OpenType features, a variety of ligatures
    and alternative glyphs allow the user to create more authentic and varied connections
    between letters. Used thoughtfully, BistroScript is guaranteed to enhance any
    print job.\"</em>\r\n\r\nI know, I helped Tomas with the English text for his
    catalogue. This is from my version of the text document that's still on my hard

    era with this script! I can't wait to learn more about the OpenType features of
    BistroScript and see what other font(s) you have up your sleeves.\r\n\r\n"

    just for that (and for the rest too, of course!) Congratulations!
