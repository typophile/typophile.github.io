  to ask about identifying fonts and working with prints, web-design and such this
  should be a great place to learn and get help.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the font that
  RipCurl uses, on their website, in ads, prints etc.\r\nIt might be a custom font,
  I've searched and asked all my usual places and now here.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/riprip_4573.jpg]"
