body: Hey so maybe I shoulda asked Tom directly, but i figured maybe some of you might
  know about this as well... I have a couple fonts that show up in the InDesign font
  menu list in at the bottom of the list in their own separate category &#40;House
  Industries&#39; Latino Rhumba and Samba for example, but the illustration font shows
  up in the regular listing&#41; Needless to say, this bugs me. What I want to know
  is how can I avoid  this problem when building my own fonts? Any insight would be
  appreciated. Thnx.

  body: InDesign lists font according to encoding, the idea being that all your Cyrillic
    fonts will list together, all your Greek fonts, etc. Fonts that do not have a
    standard encoding recognised by the application are listed at the bottom of the
    list.

    So I&#39;m asuming that Word doesn&#39;t follow a similar listing by encoding

  body: I&#39;m interested to know what criteria FL uses for including <BR>the encodings
    when using the auto function. I&#39;ve developed  <BR>an extended latin charcter
    set covering CE languages. When I hit <BR>auto in the Supported Codepages I get
    a few strange ones. <BR>For instance, 857 IBM Turkish and 1258 Vietnamese. <BR>
    <BR>Curiosly, fonts like Myriad Pro do not show up in this lower <BR>portion of
    the menu while mine does. &#40;They have nearly the <BR>same glyphs, minus the
    Cyrillic&#41;  <BR> <BR>What supported codepages relegate the fonts to the lower
    menu?

    BORDER=0>  Don&#39;t trust the auto codepage selection: it almost always adds
    Vietnamese and other non-supported pages. Codepage support is meant to be very
    specific: you are not supposed to claim support for a codepage unless you support
    all of the characters it includes. So the best idea is to manually select codepages
    that you know your font supports. <BR> <BR>The InDesign menu has changed recently,
    I believe. I have not taken a close look at what InDesign CS does.'

  body: This was my hunch, but it&#39;s nice to be sure. Especially in <BR>regards
    to the need to inlcude all characters for a defined codepage. I didn&#39;t know
    this. <BR> <BR>As for InDesign CS, the fonts with multi script support still <BR>rest
    at the bottom of the menu.
