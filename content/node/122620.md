  an integral part of the Malay culture since the dawn of Islam in the Malay Archipelago
  region. It shaped the identity and distinction of the Malays in the past. Jawi also
  acts as a link between culture and religion as the Arabic letters are being used
  in the Holy Quran.\r\nHowever, Jawi has been losing its relevance due to the modernisation
  of culture and the introduction of the Romanised Bahasa Melayu (Rumi). Thus, let
  us now take baby steps to recognise Jawi rekindle our love for this art.\r\nConducted
  by brother Hazrin Mohamad, founder and creative director of HAZWORKZ, the Art Of
  Jawi Workshop aims to explore a more contemporary aspect of Jawi where the idea
  of Jawi calligraphy will be introduced. Besides that, basic reading and writing
  of Jawi will be taught as well. You can visit Haz Workz fb page to his works and
  art. Its Facinating!!!\r\nSo, what are you waiting for? Come on down and join us
  to grab this \"exclusive\" chance towards rediscovering our heritage as well as
  the revival of Jawi!\r\nDetails\r\nPROGRAM ITINERARY\r\n10.00 am \u2013 11.15 am
