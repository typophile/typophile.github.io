  past lives, life after death, psychic stuff, mediums etc. I need to choose the right
  cover headline typeface.\r\n\r\nI don't want anything too scary looking but something
  that matches these delicate themes so I'm thinking it should probably be some humanist,
  sans-serif type since it deals women are main target here. I guess it might also
  be a type that's slightly unusual (the way it's cut or something) since these topics
  are unusual in itself aswell...\r\n\r\nI tried Cora for Headlines...and it looks
  better than any other I tried but I know it's not the one so It would help to hear
  your suggestions.\r\n\r\nKeywords for choosing this type would be: unusual, not
  everyday, serious, delicate, women(?)...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    looking for\u2026 too weird?\r\nCora strikes me as <em>extremely</em> clean-cut
    and \"cool\", considering the topic at hand.\r\n\r\nHow about something from PSY/OPS?
    Their fonts might mostly specify as \"just a little bit weird\". I think I'd try
    <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eidetm.html\">Eidetic Modern</a> where
    the White sometimes creeps in on the black &ndash; like a past life creeps in
    on the present, or the \"invisible\" on the \"visible\" etc. Ha, you got a rationalization
    too! :o)"

    your readers do it. Just kidding. But I was at a party not too long ago, chatting
    with a person. When I asked what they did, they told me they were a psychic, which
    I said was really interesting. So when asked what I did, I of course said, <em>\"You
    tell me!\"</em>\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi...both Dalliance and Mystic are a bit too much. Eidetic modern is much
    better.\r\n\r\nI don't want these books looking like they usually do- scary and
    crappy. I'd like them to look a bit more decent so I think I need a decent sans
    serif with some slight unusual differences in way it's cut or something!?\r\n\r\nAny
    other suggestions?"

  body: "Altaira, Eidetic modern is the way I guess...The more I look at it the more
    I like it- it really looks the way you descibed it and it's not toooo much. Can
    it be used for the main headline on the cover since I don't think it's display
    type??\r\nOr is there display type similar to Eidetic Modern?"

    can be used large: if it looks good,* do it. (Hardcore text fonts will likely
    look a bit strange at large sizes, but sometimes that effect is desired.) It's
    just that display fonts can't be used for text.\r\n* I'd try via the type tester
    before buying."
