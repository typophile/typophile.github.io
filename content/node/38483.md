body: "Sort of.\r\n\r\nGeorge Williams has extended FontForge to support Raph Levien's
  Spiro curves.\r\nUnfortunately, the process to install everything and make it function
  correctly is quite opaque to me.\r\nFor purposes of licensing and patents and other
  things I don't understand, the Spiro libraries are not included in the basic install
  of the latest FontForge, so some other stuff I don't readily understand has to be
  done to get them all working together.\r\n\r\nThere is a Gobuntu build recipe at
  [[http://understandinglimited.com/2007/10/26/ff-spiro/]] which looks like a bunch
  of UNIX gobbledygook to me.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how to get it working on Mac
  OS X 10.4 X11, please share with us. I'd be much obliged."

  body: "I'm no Mac expert, but if you asked on an appropriate Usenet newsgroup (maybe
    comp.sys.mac.system or comp.sys.mac.apps?), somebody who is would probably be
    willing to convert those instructions from Ubuntu to OS X.  If you know any Fink
    gurus, you might also talk to them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it looks like this job
    will take considerable time and patience.  The fact that the instructions ask
    you to get FontForge from CVS suggests that there hasn't yet been an official
    release with Spiro support.  When such a release becomes available, the install
    process may get simpler.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    a running version. The recipe asks to define <code>TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER</code>

    TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER if you want to compile a bytecode interpreter

    used for hinting, there seems to be no problem.\r\n\r\nWhat I get is not fully
    functional (for instance, I can't import Raph's files) but if you are in a hurry
    to see what is probably coming soon, you can try this <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/recipe.txt\">recipe.txt</a>.
    Just create some temporary folder, save <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/recipe.txt\">recipe.txt</a>
    it it, then <code>cd</code> there and type \"<code>source recipe.txt</code>\".
    You will need to enter an empty password after the first line and then the installation
    password when you are asked; wget and darcs are not used. Patience required. "

  body: "Since the Gobuntu recipe, lots of modifications were made to fontforge and
    the recipe is now much shortened. A Spiro library is now available  <a href =\"http://libspiro.sourceforge.net/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.
    You just install it and then compile fontforge with the standard recipe which
    has now replaced <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/recipe.txt\"><strong>recipe.txt</strong></a>.
    No need of the bytecode interpreter and my guess is that with the next build,
    installation on the mac will be fast and easy.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\nPS And, though
    I have not tried extensively the resulting binary, it looks completely functional."

    the system install DVD, but as an option that may not be pre-installed) and double-click
    the package, then launch X11 and select FontForge from its applications menu.\r\n\r\nYou
    need Cygwin to run FF on Windows, and I don't really know anything about that.\r\n\r\nBut
    that's just the pre-built package. The development builds (such as the one incorporating
    Spiro features) are a bit more involved to deal with. Michel has explained what
    to do with them, but it still goes way over my head."

    when to choose one over the other.

    with an optional X11 install right on the system DVD, AND it also contains all
    tools necessary to build (compile) FontForge. I have an easy shell script that
    downloads, compiles and installs FontForge and all its dependancies, all in one
    simple step -- it would be more difficult on Windows. \r\n\r\nI uploaded my simple
    one-click FontForge installer onto: \r\nhttp://www.font.org/software/fontforge/buildfontforge-macosx.zip\r\n\r\nShould
    work on Mac OS 10.5 and 10.4. You may need to first install subversion to get
