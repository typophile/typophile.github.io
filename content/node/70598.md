  body: Nice, but are you aware of the meaning of the word "turd" in English...? May
    I suggest you come up with a different name ? ;-)

  body: I love this face, it's looking really nice. The large x-height gives it a
    unique look. I would suggest redrawing the lowercase /g/... this one doesn't work
    at all.

  body: "Great start. Some quick thoughts: \r\n\r\na-the top arm seems a bit short\r\ng-the
    bottom seems a little out of character with the rest. It probably shouldn\u2019t
    turn back upwards, but level out instead, before going down.\r\nr-the arm should
    start a bit lower on the stem\r\nt-I would extend the cross bar a little to the
    right"

  body: "@omashuisje yes, my english is not that good - my idea were to relate a special
    kind of bird, very common on the neibourhood on all places i lived which were
    a reference to its proportions, as well for having part of 'Didone' on its name:
    http://www.google.pt/images?um=1&hl=pt-PT&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&tbs=isch:1&sa=1&q=turdido+bird&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=
    - well, maybe i can disguise this name enough if i rename it to 'Tourdido' ?\r\n\r\n@traviskochel
    , @StevenAcres - thank you both! :) - anyway i fixed 'a' and 'g' indeed, and i'll
    show it later here. On 'a' i really wanted a short arm (like some carolingian
    calligraphy) and a narrow bowl height (like Garamond), and i'm also sensible that
    it looks weird and dissonant among the whole, and what i'm trying to do is doing
    small changes could increase some harmony, and it seems having an horizontal (orthogonal
    as almost everything else, as needed on that 'g' tail turnback) upper bowl stroke.
    And thanks about those 't' and 'r' issues i didn't notice about.\r\n\r\n"

  body: '@omashuisje or maybe Turido, what do you think? (now let''s start playing
    with names for finding one more appropriated... :) ) i''m avoiding Tourido or
    Torido, because it may sound like ''bull'' on iberic/latinamerican languages...
    (and i wanted to avoid this similarity, since i''m against bullfights, and i really
    don''t want to see my typeface used on bullfight posters just because its name...
    ;) ) - anyway, suggestions for the name are welcome! :)'

    think 'a' were fixed enough?), 't', and since i had to fix 'r', i fixed 'h','n'
    and 'm' as well. (of course i will have to do some more bezier drawing fixes,
    correcting the thick and thin stroke measures, in a next version)\r\n\r\nas well,
