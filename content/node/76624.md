  to create a print document based on it, however the company that designed the logo
  originally is not being forthcoming with the information ... see the attached image,
  best quality I have available to me\r\n\r\nI believe the second part of the font
  is \"frutiger light\" from the people at Adobe, but I have not been able to identify
  the first part, I think that maybe the serif on the 'h' in 'school' might help to
  identify it,\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n"

  body: Thanks, but no, I don't think so ... the letter 'o' seems to be rounder ...
    and the 'f' and 'c' also seem slightly different ... will continue the search
