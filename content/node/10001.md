  body: This is a good thread. Thanks Keith. However, I only can say &#34;it depends
    on the job&#34;. Each job asks different questions, and those questions create
    different needs. I&#39;ve dealt with each of these and they&#39;ve come in different
    orders for different jobs.  <BR> <BR>I am blessed with clients that trust my judgement
    as far as type selection goes. I tend to talk their ear off about why they should
    choose a specific typeface or why I have used it. They then go pale and ask me
    never to do that again. <BR> <BR>If I had a dollar for every client that thanked
    me for the unnecessary type history lesson... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
