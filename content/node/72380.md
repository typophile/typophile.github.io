    and Veer collections for high contrast serifs. Did not see it anywhere. I will
    be curious to see an answer for this one too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I am! \r\n\r\nBut who cares, I think it looks good as a logotype, and certainly
    caught my eye.\r\n\r\nOut of interest does this mean it's a rip off or a poorly
    constructed typeface?"
