  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am creating a set of OpenType fonts for professionally typesetting Biblical Hebrew.</p>
<p>Unlike previous generations of computer-based typeface software, placement of upper taamei mikrah (or taamei mikrah positioned above the Hebrew aleph-beis characters) is no longer determined by the user of the left-to-right typesetting program. Even is cold-type, hot-type, or even computer-based film-type, placement was determined by the operator annd/or the typesetting program. The actual typeface was passive, and did not determine the exact positioning of the various diacritic markings, such as the nikkud, the taamim (trop), the meteg, or the shva-nah, etc.</p>
<p>However, in the newest generation of Biblical Hebrew typesetting, the operator/typesetter and/or the typesetting program does not determine the placement of the diacritic markings. The actual well-crafted OpenType Biblical Hebrew font determines the placement of the diacritic markings.</p>
<p>Since that is the case, I seek to know if there is a rule  or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah.</p>
<p>I have noticed in pre-computer age Biblical Hebrew books of the Hebrew Bible, the placement of upper taamei mikrah were often determined by where they would fit best. In most post-computer age Biblical Hebrew books of the Hebrew Bible, many recent books have made the placement of upper taamei mikrah on the far left hand side of Hebrew aleph-beis characters, in order to allow certain symbols to be placed above the Hebrew aleph-beis characters in the center.</p>
<p>It seems then that there are no hard rules or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah. Or, the earlier typesetters or typeface creators/programmers simply were unaware of any hard rules or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah.</p>
<p>Does anybody know if there are rules or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah? Pease share them with me, or inform me of the contacts with the appropriate scholars who do know.</p>
<p>Similar, I am interested in the various rules for shva-nah, shva-nach, komatz katan, komatz gadol, hataf komatz katan, hataf komatz gadol, and any other grammaticalrules governing Hebrew.</p>

<p>Actually, I do not know if there are no hard rules, or there are in fact hard rules, but earlier typesetters were simply unaware of them.</p>
<p>When it comes to the subtleties of Hebrew glyph placement, Hebrew grammar rules and their use/application, these are subjects generally out of the realm of graphic art and typesetting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, about one hundred years ago, mainstream Judaism preferred to discourage widespread knowledge of these topics, as they were areas of knowledge known best to maskilim (opponents of mainstream Judaism). In this way, people who were maskilim could be easily identified (by their knowledge of these topics), as theor outward appearance was similar.</p>
<p>As a ressult, unfortunately, most people, including great scholars, no longer are familiar with these topics.</p>

<p>There are many books on the basics of Hebrew grammar. What I seek is not basic. I don&rsquo;t seek the definitions of these forms, such as, shva-nah, shva-nach, komatz katan, komatz gadol, hataf komatz katan, hataf komatz gadol, etc.</p>
<p>As you write, I seek &ldquo;how &amp; when to use/apply the rules&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I seek to better understand these rules, the conditions of their use and application, in order to incorporate them into the OpenType Hebrew fonts I am creating.</p>
<p>For example, John Hudson created the excellent SBL-Hebrew OpenType Biblical Hebrew typeface, and incorporated the Hebrew grammatical rule of the furtive patach into the font.</p>
<p>One vowel in Hebrew is the patach, pronounced AFTER the Hebrew letter positioned above it with an &ldquo;ah&rdquo; sound. However, if the patach is position above the final Hebrew letter of the word, and that final Hebrew letter is either a Ches or an Ayin, then its positioning in under the extreme left side of the Hebrew letter. This indicated to the reader that the patach is not pronounced AFTER the Hebrew letter, but instead BEFORE the Hebrew letter.</p>
<p>Tis kind of patach is called the furtive patach. Whether the typesetter or user knows this Hebrew grammar rule of not, the furtive patach automatically appears of the condition arises. I seek to do the same thing regarding other Hebrew grammar rules, wherever possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see several examples.</p>
<p>Furtive Patach is <strong>relatively</strong>  simple  since we know that there are 3 gutturals.<br>
The Rule: 
Furtive patach is an <em>a</em> vowel that is added to the 3 gutturals: het, he  &amp; ayin <strong>only</strong> when it&rsquo;s preceded by a vowel other than <em>a</em>  — you don&rsquo;t want to apply the rule to any word-final het, he &amp; ayin.
Now, you want to read the Bible; find the words; apply the rules ; build an OT feature —   how many  substitution? 100? 200? 1000?</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/node/43377">Meteg</a>
There are 10!!! different kinds of metegs!!! You want to read the whole bible;find the words with meteg;apply the rules, build an OT feature —  how many  substitution? 500? 1000? 2000? Just for one mark!?!?</p>
<p>Dagesh: 
Let&rsquo;s see the next sample  —  Genesis 1: 11.  The  word peri (fruit; mentioned 200 times, more or less) + dagesh.  One of them is 
punctuated with  dagesh hazak.   So, just for one word! + one mark  you want to have 200  substitutions?
<img src="/images/old-images/PeriSample_6387.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. This is a HUGE task!!!!</p>

<p>It would be great for an OpenType Biblical Hebrew font to have contextual processing look-ups for every use of meteg, but I believe that the current version of OpenType, MS VOLT 1.3, and Adobe InDesign CS3 ME could handle that much processing.</p>
<p>A huge data base has already been created with every occurance cited. So, that aspect is not the hurdle.</p>
<p>Perhaps, instead of character placement, ligature replacement could occur instead, causing metegs to be added to the text that doesn&rsquo;t have it. I think it would reduce the processing workload. But again I think this is beyond the limits of the software involved.</p>
<p>Where it could be implemented is by shva-nah, shva-nach, komatz katan, komatz gadol, hataf komatz katan, and hataf komatz gadol, because their occurances are much fewer than meteg.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, they have been placed like graphic symbols aligned to the nikkud on the right side, with a slight space to separate them, and a meteg (if necessary) on the left side, with a slight space to separate them.</p>
<p>Regarding the upper taamei mikrah, traditionally they have been centered above the Hebrew letters.</p>
<p>This poses a problem regarding the shvah-nah, as two graphic symbols can not take up a single space. Plus, with variable character widths, this was too difficult to program in a font in the pre-OpenType days. So, the upper taamei mikrah were simply placed on the extreme left.</p>
<p>However, if the upper taamei mikrah are placed according to the way they are chanted, perhaps their placement varies.</p>
<p>Perhaps, similar rules apply to lower taamei mikrah, as you half seriously imply.</p>
<p>Btw, David, I think shva-nah, komatz katan,  and hataf komatz katan, is doable through font-based ligatures, not through OT/VOLT replacements, although I agree that its not practical or efficient as you describe it for meteg.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will know OpenType and MS VOLT&rsquo;s limitations better by next month.</p>
<p>In the Talmud we learn that when one knows well the limitations that one deals with, then the fun begins, creative work arounds, etc. I don&rsquo;t give up easily.</p>

<p>The issue we are groping in the sequences when narrow Hebrew letters like vohv or yuhd appear before left aligned Hebrew letters daled or reish, and sets of taam/nikkud/meteg appear under them.</p>
<p>As you can picture, very little space exists, and bumping or overlapping occurs, if we apply the same default nikkud/taam placement rules as in other combinations.</p>
<p>If course, as the professional Hebrew typesetter knows, this can be addressed and corrected through kerning, where the bumping or overlapping is removed by nudging different elements.</p>
<p>The question is how to best incorporate these personalized tweakings into the OpenType Biblical Hebrew font as a sub-set of instructions, so that the inexperienced user will enjoy this knowledgeable result automatically.</p>
<p>Like including a furtive patach-like instruction for shvah-nah, or for komatz katan, I believe this too can be incoporated into the well-made OpenType Biblical Hebrew font.</p>

<p>Why do I need an automatic font?</p>

<p>Everybody wants to what&rsquo;s right. Nobody likes to do something incorrect, and have others say that there is mud on my face.</p>
<p>As users of Biblical Hebrew, be it the well read Reform Jew, the yeshiva bachur/student, or the Catholic Bible student, learn that that there is a correct way to display Biblical Hebrew text, and there is an incorrect or sloppy was to display Biblical Hebrew text, they will of course desire to correctly Biblical Hebrew text.</p>
<p>If this can be done automatically because the OpenType Biblical Hebrew font thoughtfully and carefully made, the user will want such an automatic font.</p>

<p>Why do I care about what is kamats katan or gadol?</p>

<p>Again, I truly believe that as people, particularly children, become increasingly knowledgeable about rules of Biblical Hebrew grammar, then these issues will become increasingly important. As a result, we will care a lot about displaying Biblical Hebrew text with a kamats katan or gadol.</p>
<p>It is because we don&rsquo;t know these Biblical Hebrew grammar rules well that we don&rsquo;t care so much about displaying Biblical Hebrew text with a kamats katan or gadol.</p>

<p>As I said before. The furtive patach isn’t an automatic, unless you are going to “feed” the font with 2,000 !!! words, or more with the furtive patach + the exceptional. The same thing with kamats katan — more than 2,000!!! words + the exceptional. The same thing with shava — 5,000, 6,000&hellip;who knows the number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are speaking about the vocabulary, and see therefore it as an impossible hurdle to overcome.</p>
<p>I understand that there are basic Biblical Hebrew grammar rules which cause a kamats to be kotan or gadol, or a shah to be nach or nah. Hence, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be impossible to hurdle.</p>
<p>You might be right, but I think it&rsquo;s worth the effort to explore. Don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me address this  issue one more time. And this is my last word.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep in mind that you&rsquo;re talking about an automatic font, and not just diacritic positioning, right?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> My bad. I didn&rsquo;t ask you for a sample (or two, or three) with the incorrect way to display Biblical Hebrew text, as you wrote. Do you have it? 
Here,  to my left, I have a Huge selection of the Hebrew Bibles.  Well, I don&rsquo;t see any sloppy way, or something so awful. Of course, If we are talking about Bibles from the 1930s, 1940s  etc etc  —   there&rsquo;re things  to improve. But again there&rsquo;s nothing so so  awful. The master work is  — without doubt — the bible  <strong>Jerusalem Crown</strong>.<br>
Even <strong>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</strong> (BHS) is fine — and this bible is fully loaded  with errors all the way from here to Australia.
Prayer books — I don&rsquo;t see the sloppy way. Of course, there are good publishers, and there are good &ldquo;publishers&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> &gt; particularly children, become increasingly knowledgeable about rules of Biblical Hebrew grammar</p>
<p>Next to the Bibles I have the tons books, textbooks about grammar, cantillation etc etc. I&rsquo;m looking at one of them. This is a textbook + cd (junior high). I don&rsquo;t see any sloppy way. This book is really &amp; truly great;  from a to z, or alef to tav.  No sloppy, or shompy. The important aspect of this book  is the approval!!!<br>
The book is approved by the most important figures in the religious world: Rabbi Sraya Devlitzky (Bnei Brak) &amp; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (Jerusalem).  I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with Rabbi Devlitzky, or  Rabbi Yosef . But when the say it&rsquo;s OK, it isn&rsquo;t just OK — it&rsquo;s perfect OK!   So, don&rsquo;t worry too much about the education!!! You need to be around those kids and see how they read/chant, and what they know about grammar. Moreover, there are tons of CDs/DVDs/softwares with voice + color.  I  don&rsquo;t see why they need any automatic thing.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>. &gt; You are speaking about the vocabulary</p>
<p>Again, you need to read between the lines Israel :^)
This is not just a matter of  vocabulary. Any automatic thing needs to address  the differences between <strong>The Leningrad Codex</strong> &amp; <strong>The Aleppo Codex</strong>. Do you understand  the scope of that?</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> &gt; A shvah nah is usually depicted by a small asterisk floating above the Hebrew character, somewhat like one of the upper taamei mikra&hellip; is a logical relationship in the Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules for shvah nah and the taamei mikra.</p>
<p>Truly &amp; honest —  I don&rsquo;t have a clue what are you talking about. What is exactly the essence of this latest discovery?</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>When I bemoan the incomplete knowledge of Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules as a insulting comment that there is a widespread lack of knowledge. Thank G-d, many of those who love the study of the Bible in its original know many Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules.</p>
<p>Yet, as in kabballistic literature there is a discussion that the truly wise person realizes that as he or she knows more and more, in truth they know less and less in relationship to how much knowledge there is to know. There is no limit of how much infinite wisdom one can optain; the more you know, the more you realize that there is so much more to know.</p>
<p>Reb Ovadiah Yosef Shlita will be the first to say this. The other great scholar and leader I di no know. As you remember, Reb Ovadiah was a past Chief Rabbi (Sephardic) of Israel in the late &rsquo;70s. He has a huge following in Israel today.</p>
<p>Regarding the sleuth of Hebrew Bibles that are seemingly incomplete, with the exception of Rabbi Winefield&rsquo;s Shai L&rsquo;Morah series of books, including the Tanach, the shvah-nah (and usually the komatz katan and hataf komatz katan) does not appear.</p>
<p>This is clearly a lacking, as a few books of the Rishonim (early rabbinic authorities, like Rashi and Maimonides) document these Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules, and preceded the invention of the printing press by over a hundred years.</p>
<p>JC,</p>
<p>I agree there are different definitions of the rules for shvah nah. (The solution is to have different fonts for different folks; just like some like chocolate, and others like vanilla.)</p>
<p>I think either definition is doable. Hopefully. It&rsquo;s certainly worth a good college try.</p>
<p>I think that David thinks it impossible, so it&rsquo;s not worth trying.</p>

<p>No one explains on any product not only the various views of shvah-nah or even a single view of shvah-nah. All I have heard is how a set of Hebrew letters are pronounced with shvah-nah and with an ordinary shvah.</p>
<p>We may have tools to help us chant the taamei mikra, for ones bar mitzvah for example, but the correct typographical placement is not taught.</p>
<p>Just because chanting is being addressed even creatively does not excuse the fact we are ignorant of this aspect of Jewish tradition. The way we address an aspect of ignorance regarding an important part of Biblical Hebrew is not with making excuses and pointing to other great achievements; The way we address an aspect of ignorance regarding an important part of Biblical Hebrew is by replacing the ignorance with knowledge experience.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get how slight differences in the Biblical Hebrew, about 10 to 15 Hebrew characters has to do with the creation and inclusion of automatic Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules for (two or three kinds of) shvah-nah, and komatz katan (and hataf komatz katan), like SBL-Hebrew&rsquo;s automatic Biblical Hebrew grammatical rule for furtive patach.</p>

<p>The shvah-nah is graphically represented in many books which feature nikkud, such as the siddur or Jewish prayerbook, or hagada (Passover seder text), by a small asterisk over Hebrew letters that have a shvah (such as the books published by Kehos, the Chabad-Lubavitch publisher), or a straight thin horizontal line over Hebrew letters that have a shvah (such as the books published by ArtScroll, the world&rsquo;s largest Jewish commercial publisher). I am unsure what JPS does. Rabbi Winefield&rsquo;s Shai L&rsquo;Morah publishing house uses a circle around a small asterisk (to draw greater asttention to the symbol for shvah-nah.</p>

<p>Unlike the furtive patach, or the folded ayin or lamed, or the truncated final chof or truncated final chof, which are mainly typographical issues (although thefirtive parach does limited grammatical impact), the shvah-nah, or or the hataf komatz kayan, are in deed full Hebrew grammatical symbols based upon Hebrew grammatical rules.</p>
<p>As such, they should have their own Unicode values, like the komatz katan, shnah, or any nikkud or taamei mikra.</p>
<p>True, there are different graphic symbols which Hebrew publishers have depicted the shvah-nah (at least four kinds of glyphs), bit all agree that a shvah-nach and shvah-nah are distict elements in Hebrew grammar.</p>
<p>I have chosen to make this a public record to encourage your respected status among the Unicode Consortium to do the right thing asap, so that my OpenType Biblical Hebrew fonts may incorporate the entire body of Hebrew glyphs, and that Unicode support Hebrew completely.</p>

<p>Exodus 17: 12.

And this is only one little sample. There are more words. Tons!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Lubavitcher Chassidic Jew. People often accuse us of attributing messianic status to the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, even after his demise. They often ask, &ldquo;If somebody else declares himself the long awaited messiah, could you accept him?&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the kind of OpenType Biblical Font which you call &lsquo;regular&rsquo;, I can make &lsquo;automatic&rsquo;, could you, David, accept it?</p>

<p>I am not being defensive.</p>
<p>I am trying to very carefully show that utmost respect for great leaders and everyday folks who do have a knowledge of Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules.</p>
<p>Yet, there is so much more to know, so much so, that this that we do know now is insignificant by comparison with how much we don&rsquo;t know yet, and have still to uncover and know.</p>
<p>By having this honest attitude and realistic realization about what is still lacking, then we are capable of learning more.</p>
<p>But if we feel about ourselves and others, that we know it all, then we are not capable if learning more, because we won&rsquo;t even try, as we think that we know it all.</p>

<p>One of my sons learn at a high school/yeshiva where Rabbi Winefield&rsquo;s (the author and publisher of the Shay La&rsquo;Morah series)son is the administrator.

I don&rsquo;t know what is the Keter Torah edition.</p>
<p>Rabbi Winefield is not only a very learned writer, but a great scholar and well versed in the Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules. He applied one kind of rules for shvah-nah rules, which are usually applied for post-Biblical rules, to the text of the Bible.</p>

<p>You can certainly find examples that I overlooked. More power to you. However, here was not the case (G-d does not want to fling mud in my face!)</p>
<p>In the two examples that you cite, there is no shvah-nah.</p>
<p>According to the Biblical Hebrew grammatical rules for shvah-nah employed by Rabbi Winefield, Kehot (the huge Chabad/Lubavitch publishing house), and ArtScroll (the evedn huger and largesy Jewish publisher in the world), there is NEVER EVER a shvah-nah under the first letter of a Hebrew word.</p>
<p>I believe you are confusing an ordinary shvah (which inmdicates to the reader ti make a very short sound of the consonant above it), and a true shvah-nah ( is a series of two sounds, a continuation of the consonant/vowel combination of the set in the Hebrew letter BEFORE the Hebrew letter with a shvah under it, AND ALSO the short sound of the Hebrew letter with a shvah under it.</p>
<p>In your example from Exodus 17:12, the word with a shvah-nah is pronounced &ldquo;tam-meh-chu&rdquo;. If it were only an ordinary shvah, it would be pronounced &ldquo;tah-meh-chu&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The reason why the latter two examples did not have a graphic symbol indicating a shvah-nah, a circle around a small asterisk, is because the shvah is an ordinary one, and not a shvah-nah.</p>

<p>In my limited experience, I still have not discovered a shvah-nah in a place belonging to an upper taamei mikra.</p>
<p>This makes me suspect that there is a relationship between the appearance of a lower taamei mikra and the appearance of a shvah-nah, making the rule in Hebrew grammar even tighter, and hence easily to implement as an automatic feature in carefully crafted OpenType Biblical Hebrew font.</p>
<p>This is unlike David&rsquo;s assumption, that because the shvah-nah will appear a lot, it can not be incorporated as a rule in an OpenType table in an OpenType Biblical Hebrew font.</p>

 Also, Israel: I think you might be confusing the effect of <em>sheva nah</em> with that of the strong <em>dagesh</em>=<em>mapiq</em> (or weak <em>dagesh</em>; I can&rsquo;t recall which). To abuse the word, Example 1 as written “תָּֽמְכ֣וּ” would be pronounced &ldquo;tam-chu&rdquo;; if written “תָּֽמְֿכ֣וּ”, &ldquo;ta-mə-chu&rdquo;; if written “תָּֽמְּֿכ֣וּ”, &ldquo;tam-mə-chu&rdquo;. (Of course there are grammatical rules that say which pronounciation to apply to the unpunctuated word “תמכו”, and not every version is possible.) Also, the sign above the <em>sheva</em> in the printed version is not what I&rsquo;m used to seeing to indicate <em>sheva nah</em>: usually I see “מְֿ” (<em>mem</em>+<em>sheva</em>+<em>rafe</em>) rather than what looks like “מְ֯” (<em>mem</em>+<em>sheva</em>+<em>masora</em>-circle).
 At any rate, I think a font is the wrong place for <em>sheva nah</em>/<em>nach</em> detection. An external program can me much more intelligent &amp; customizable to different rule-sets, while leaving the correct layout to the font.
 (Furtive <em>patah</em> might be an exception: I believe the word “נֹחַ” (Noah) is supposed to be encoded <em>nun</em>+<em>holam</em>+<em>het</em>+<em>patah</em> rather than “נַֹח” (<em>nun</em>+<em>holam</em>+<em>patah</em>+<em>het</em>); but detecting {<em>ayin</em>, <em>het</em>, <em>heh</em>+<em>mapiq</em>}+<em>patah</em>+word-end is relatively simple. John&rsquo;s font does something like that, I believe.)

<p>Thank you for your two cents&hellip; I have change of a nickel, if you want. I love to get rid of my pennies, those wretched useless things.</p>
<p>Well, you say with absolute certainty that an ordinary shvah at the beginning of every word is always nah (nuhn + ayin). I say with absolute certainty that an ordinary shvah at the beginning of every word is always nach (nuhn + chet - a furtive patach, David?).</p>
<p>What ia nah, and what is nach, you might wonder? Pray tell, whar is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>Nah means &ldquo;moving&rdquo;, because it&rsquo;s transitionary between one letter before and the letter above it. I hope I&rsquo;m right. Is G-d getting that mud ready to fling at my face?</p>
<p>Nach means &ldquo;resting&rdquo; or &ldquo;stationary&rdquo;, because it only sit under and effects the pronunciation of the letter above it. Anyway, that&rsquo;s what I was taught (is the mud dripping down my shirt?).</p>
<p>A proof can simply be found among the largest sets of Hebrew books with nikkud, the books of Kehot Publishing Company and that of ArtScroll/Mesorah, where no graphic symbol indicating a shvah-nah is ever used above the first letter of a Hebrew word indicating a shvah-nah and not an ordinary shvah.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you seem to understand the terms shvah-nah and shvah-nach differently than me. How do you understand it?</p>

<p>I agree with you, and I disagree with you. (something admitting my lacking in knowledge of Hebrew grammar rules, while at the same time allowing myself to represent having some expertise in the subject). To me it&rsquo;s not a contradiction.</p>
<p>I agree with you, regarding rules like dagesh, meteg etc., which should be delegating to the text entry and Unicode values.</p>
<p>I disagree with you, regarding rules like furtive patach, shvah-nah, and maybe even kametz katan.</p>
<p>This is because if we delegate them to text entry and Unicode values (assuming shvah-nah gets a Unicode value, John), the hell will freeze over before the Tanach gets this stuff put into its data. Besides, most people (including both of us, David) don&rsquo;t know our shvah-nah, and maybe even kametz katan.</p>
<p>Hence, the simple easy and quick way is font-based.</p>

<p>Boy, I thought type designers had creative, flexible thinking.</p>
<p>It is explained by the Rebbe Reshab in the famous series of discourses called &ldquo;Ayin-Beis&rdquo; that the sign of a wise person is the ability to tolerate two opposites in his or her mind.</p>
<p>Patiently, they consider how both ideas are true, and discover a novel way of understanding them that people didn&rsquo;t consider before.</p>
<p>To address your question, just because you tell others that you lack COMPLETE knowledge in a certain field, does not mean there are areas of knowledge in that same field that are &ldquo;givens&rdquo; for you, and you express them like an expert.</p>

<p>Are all of these on Biblical Hebrew grammar?</p>
<p>I was told that there is also a view in a respected book on Biblical Hebrew grammar that shows how every Hebrew word that has a shvah at the beginning of that word, then that shvah is in deed a shvah-nah, just like JCSalomon suggests, and you cite from Aharon Ben Asher.</p>
<p>However, this view appears not to be followed by three major Jewish publishers, Kehot, ArtScroll, and Shay LeMoreh. Apparently, it is a valid opinion, but not widely accepted and used. Hence, if I would include in an automatic OpenType Hebrew font one rule for  shva-nah or another, I would choose the widely accepted and used rule, and save the other room for a chat on Typophile.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get riled over that. There  are much more pressing issues to get riled about.</p>

<p>According to what I was told the shva under a first letter is always a schva na, and so should be transliterated in English with an &lsquo;e&rsquo;. But in fact Hebrew speakers today seem to avoid a spoken &lsquo;shva&rsquo; whenever possible. Thus it&rsquo;s normally said &ldquo;bracha&rdquo; (blessing) and not &ldquo;beracha.&rdquo; Though if you are singing or pronouncing it slowly a native might pronounce the shva, right?</p>
<p>The reason I say all this is that for the poor learner like me it&rsquo;s hard to tell what the heck is going on.</p>
<p>I mention this because when you go to Biblical marks of vowels and cantillation, nobody knows what exactly was in the heads of the masorites who did it, as far as pronounciation.  And we have different histories of ashkenasi, sfardic, yemeni, iraqi, etc. pronunciations of Hebrew just to confuse us further in trying to think about these issues.</p>
<p>So wouldn&rsquo;t just leaving the masorite marks as is, admitting we don&rsquo;t exactly know, be a better course of action, rather than trying to create a system of pronunciation that is not modern, nor do we really know whether it&rsquo;s ancient?</p>
<p>I mean, Avot also says that the wise person when he doesn&rsquo;t know says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An initial sheva is always¹ nah 
Yes, you&rsquo;re right.  This is the rule #1; every book will start with this rule.  Here&rsquo;s a sample ( with nikud, since I know that a lot can&rsquo;t read without the nikud):
<img src="/images/old-images/Shava_6640.gif" alt=""></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so it is simply not indicated.
Indeed. That&rsquo;s the reason.  This shva is the easy one. And it dosen&rsquo;t matter if we are talking about Modern or Biblical Hebrew. Things are more complicated,  or  there&rsquo;s a controversy (well, there&rsquo;s more than one) if we are talking, for example,  about initial shva  + meteg.  This issue is part of  the well known controversy between ben Asher and ben Naftali &ndash; Kitab al-khilaf (edited by Misha&rsquo;el ben Uzziel).  This is Hebrew-Arabic text: 
<img src="/images/old-images/BenAsher_5507.gif" alt="">
I’ve heard a theory that the sheva at the begining of the word “שְׁנַיִם” should be nach, but I don’t know how much credence to give it.
Not a theory, but there&rsquo;s a controversy. But with the word shetayim, sheteym &lsquo;esre etc etc.  Prof. Blau talked about that issue.</p>

<p>Regardless of my perceived expertise, or ignorance (whatever it may be), I also never know what&rsquo;s going on. Btw, which way does the wind blow?</p>
<p>I also searched on the Internet, and consulted knowledgeable friends (the very best source [everyone should have a Poindexter as a friend]), and the view stated emphatically that whenever there is shvah under the first letter of any Hebrew word, it is in fact a shvah-nah (and doesn&rsquo;t have any graphic symbol.</p>
<p>Yes, I was wrong. I admit it, the great me was wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!</p>
<p>As I wipe the mud away from my face, the grammatarian in me hides his face in shame, but the typesetter and type designer in me boldly declares, that the first letter of any Hebrew word that a shvah appears under it NEVER EVER has a graphic symbol indicating it is a shvah-nah, even though it is on deed a shvah-nah.</p>
<p>Confusing? I dunno. I don&rsquo;t even know which way the wind blows.</p>
<p>Ah hah. I am wrong, but I am right!</p>
<p>Toe-may-toe, to-mat-toe. The automatic OpenType Biblical Hebrew font still breathes; it&rsquo;s not dead yet. Maybe, it never will be.</p>

<p>Right. And one more example:  ge-do-lim -&gt; gdo-lim. That&rsquo;s the spoken Hebrew. And I think that  the “tam-meh-chu” or “tah-meh-chu” is more an issue of the spoken Hebrew/tradition, since  this word  is composed of 2  syllables.</p>

<p>True. For example, the kamats  katan which was never part of the Tiberian vocalization system.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget  that we&rsquo;re talking about Biblical grammar. That said,  nikud + cantillation!  We need to be aware of the fact that (just several examples of course) 1. a secondary  merekha could change shava nah (nun, het) to shava na (nun, ayin);

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let&rsquo;s get back to: 1) the three graphic symbols for a shvah-nah (hei, not chet), 2) the komatz katan, with an extra long (downwards) center vertical stroke, or the 3) the hataf-komatz katan, with an extra long (downwards) center vertical stroke (sse Shay LeMorah publications, as I only found Rabbi Winefield indicating the rarely used hataf-komatz katan (I think the Koren Bible by Israeli type designer Mr. Eliyahu Koren a&quot;h)).</p>
<p>You said these three symbols can not be handled in a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; OpenType Biblical Hebrew font, similar to the furtive patach in John Hudson&rsquo;s SBL-Hebrew, because there are simply too many occurances of shvah-nah to do this.</p>
<p>I disagree. Why?</p>
<p>Like the rule of furtive patach, the rule of its replacement can be simply programmed, so too these three grammatical-based graphic substitutions would be replacement rule-based, and not have a gigantic exception table, as you assume.</p>
<p>Can an exception rule for shvah-nah be defined, like the furtive patach?</p>
<p>You think not. John thinks not. I think yes. We &ldquo;frummies&rdquo; like to be different.</p>
<p>About hataf-kometz katan, an exception table for every reference in Tanach could be constructed, but I think an exception rule could be defined, and even for the komatz katan.</p>
<p>The really great advantage of this besides the automatic feature which requires no input from the user, but all Unicode Biblical text would appear with the shvah-nah etc. graphic symbols, even if they don&rsquo;t exist as Unicode data in the text files.</p>
<p>Because of this great advantage, it is clearly worth the effort. As the Mishnah promises out of the ordinary success, &ldquo;yagata, matzata, taamin&rdquo;, one who exerts much effort discovers &ldquo;where there is a will, there IS a way&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ayin not hei. Silly was I; I translated the nah sound to conclude with a hei, without thinking about the Hebrew spelling.</p>
<p>Nah, of course, ends with an ayin, for the word nah means &lsquo;transentory&rsquo; or &lsquo;moving&rsquo; or &lsquo;traveling&rsquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the furtive patach is an automatic feature “which requires no input from the user”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but the data must be Unicode, and only 5 OpenType Hebrew fonts feature them. The rule was programmed through a group effort.</p>
<p>I can post three samples, as there are three different graphic symbols, from three different publishers respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If yes (no input from the user) would you mind to show us how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can post three examples, with a hei, chet, and ayin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you have here 6 words; would you mind to add the furtive patach?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These six words do not feature the need for a furtive patach.</p>
<p>As I understand it, a furtive patach can only appear under a
hei, chet, and ayin, when one of them appears at the end of a word, if the previous letter and nikud was a certain kind. I am unsure what that is.</p>
<p>The Koren Bible from the great Israeli type designer and grammaratarian Mr. Eliyahu Koren a&quot;h featured the furtive patach in his Bible. So did JPS. Also, Christian publishers use it as well. Others do not, and not in the early 1800&rsquo;s as well. I was told that the furtive patach is discussed in books of the Rishonim, the very early post-Talmudic Jewish sages.</p>
<p>As I said, I can post three examples, with a hei, chet, and ayin.</p>

<p>It seems you believe that there is a rule for furtive patach to position the patach under the character on the right EVEN for situations where the patach is in the miuddle of the word.</p>
<p>The way I understand, the furtive patach is ONLY when the patach occurs on te last letter of the word.</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;m wrong. Maybe, you refer to a diffewrent rule. Let&rsquo;s flip&hellip; :)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll check though, as I have all the Unicode data for the Tanach.</p>

<p>A shvah is simply two dots, one on top of another, positioned under the letter, like most nikkud vowels. The shvah symbol is for a full stop and only a slight or short pronunciation of the sound associated with the constanant poitioned above it.</p>
<p>A shvah-nauh has the very same graphic form as the shvah. However, another graphic symbol appears, positioned above the Hebrew letter constanant in the center.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of two kinds of geraphic symbols to indicate a shah-nauh. There are two kinds of graphic symbols, because two major publishers identify it differently.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/SHVAH-NAUH_4258.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Some publishers depict a shvah-nauygh using a straight horizontal line, based upon the identical graphic of one of the upper taamei mikra.</p>
<p>This approach has two short-comings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The reader can confuse the shvah-nauh with one of the taamei mikra;</li>
<li>This graphic symbol looks strange positioned above the narrow width chareacters.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second approach avoids these problems by using the graphic symbol of a small zero-width or floating asterisk.</p>
<p>A third graphic symbol is from Shai Lemorah publishers, which places a circle around the floating asterisk, so it should not be confused with an ordinary asterisk, or to draw stronger attention to itself.</p>

<p>I thought like you too.</p>
<p>Koreen Publishing was purchased by another firm. In addition to creating a special typeface only for their Bible (based upon drawings of Ashkenazic sources), contravercial rules for Hebrew grammar were introduced as well. This was attributed to Mr. Koren. You say differently. I think you&rsquo;re right, and they&rsquo;re mistaken, confusing the name of the company with the details of contraversy maker.</p>

<p>I see you and I define our terms differently.</p>
<p>To you, an &ldquo;automatic furtive furtive patach&rdquo; means that the user can automatically hit a button called &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; and the the ptach (which usually be placed in the centers on the level of most other nikkud, will move over to the extreme right.</p>
<p>To me, and as OpenType treats it, automatic means the default, whenever the situation and context are such that the rules of a furtive patach apply.</p>
<p>So, the default when the rules don&rsquo;t apply is an ordinaery patach, and the default when the rules do apply is a furtive patach to appear instead of the ordinary.</p>
<p>This is called &ldquo;automatic subsitution&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What you desire is to override the default.</p>

<p>In Israel, two Jewish Tanach standards are popular, besides the kinds of editions traditionally used in the US.</p>
<p>In Israel, the Mizrachi or Modern Orthodox, and very modern Israelis, prefer the Koren edition, which besides following certain modern grammar rules, caters too to Christian readers because of certain linguistic issues that they prefwer, and to modern Israelis as well because either prayer added or modifyed to acknowledge the State of Israel or the well-being of the soldiers of the IDF (in the siddur).</p>
<p>Many heredi (ultra-0rthodox) Israelis prefer rather the more traditional Breuer&rsquo;s edition, which do not have these non-traditional features.</p>
<p>Koren, though he himself was strictly Orthodox, his views on Hebrew grammar were a sythasis of his own logic, modern rules, and Jewish tradition. For this reason, he was strongly rejected by tradition enthusiasts.</p>
<p>There is a cute story about him that occurred on Friday afternoon. As the Sabbath ame closer, Koren would gather up the printed work sheets to proof-read from the other Jewish workers. He wanted that they would not mark their corrections on the printed work sheets at home on the Sabbath, when writing was prohibited for Jews. He knew the workers were not Sabbath observant, and want his bible not to have any remote association with the violation of the Sabbath.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems that your understanding of how a furtive patach is formed in certain OpenType Biblical Hebrew fonts, such as SBL-Hebrew, FrankReuhl GH, and others, is different that my understanding.</p>
<p>According to my understanding, a similar approach can be made for shvah-nauh, komatz katan, and hataf-komatz katan.</p>
<p>If it can, knowledge of these rules will increase.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that although you are clearly a talented type designer, a very knowledgeable reseacher, but you do not know advanced OpenType for Biblical Hebrew well, or even less than well.</p>
<p>This reminds me of an event which occurred about 15 years ago when I received an instruction from the late seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe to include the notations and novellae Torah of his predecessors and his own on the very front pages of a new proposed edition of the Talmud I proposed to create.</p>
<p>The chief librarian of the central Lubavitch library, one of the greatest libraries of Judaica in the world, refused to believe any such thing existed, and was dreamed up by the Rebbe as a result of his stoke.</p>
<p>When I persisted to uncover these materials, he ridiculed me. I ridiculed him back, for lacking in belief that such a thing existed without his brilliant knowledge.</p>
<p>One day, he called me up at my office and just got to the point, without any introduction or niceties. &ldquo;I believe nothing exists, and call you an ignoramus. You believe something exists, and call me an deven bigger fool. Well, I hope you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>I am sorry that you were offended by my comment. Keeping this in mind, I will try to think before I speak to you, or to anyone.</p>
<p>A fascinating lesson is taught among the Chassidim (it may also exist among other groups as well) that G-d placed two objects to filter speech between the tongue and the ears:</p>
<ol>
<li>teeth; and</li>
<li>lips.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we say something we might regret, we can clamp down the teeth, or if its later than that, we can close the lips to keep the words in.</p>
<p>Regarding your graphic example of the holam ne&rsquo;e&rsquo;lam belonging to the lamed, and appearing above the right side of the top of the following letter.</p>
<p>In this case, the following letter is the shin, which has its own dot on the top right. Two dots can not occupy the same space.</p>
<p>In tradition Hebrew typography, one dot was ommitted, leaving one single dot to share two tasks: one task being a holan ne&rsquo;e&rsquo;lam for the lamed, and the second task to indicate that the shin is in deed a shin, and not a sihn.</p>
<p>In some forms of modern typograpgy, using the PC-based TAG typesetting software, one dot can not be elemanated, leaving two dots almost besides each other, overlapping or colliding.</p>
<p>In my mind, this is unacceptable. The reader sees something unusual, unlike traditional books, and the collision is ugly. Although two separate dots is in deed more correct, I think it&rsquo;s prefered to follow the logic of traditional typesetters (which I chose); or perhaps, it&rsquo;s better to create a CPOS substitution where the collision is avoided, or a dedicated ligature.</p>
<p>What do you think, David?</p>

<p>Here are samples in FrankReuhl GH, an advanced OpenType font, with the SBL-Hebrew-like furtive patach for the chet, dotted hei, and ayin, when a patach occurs at the end of a word.</p>
<p>Notice, the ayin changes its shape whether there&rsquo;s a nikkud under it or not.</p>
<p>A dotted hei at the end of a word indicates an indirect pronoun in a feminine form, and not an ordinary dagesh. Is the hei under it indicative of &ldquo;towards&rdquo; or &ldquo;to&rdquo;, it pertains to something else?</p>

<p>I think this is a very good and valid question.</p>
<p>I have seen the furtive patach in the Koren Bible, Chumash learning books from Feldhein Publishers, and I am told it&rsquo;s in the JTS Bible and Chistian Hebrew Bibles.</p>
<p>It is not in traditional Jewish Bibles, ArtScroll bible books, nor those from other recent-day Jewish publishers, including the Shay LeMorah publishing house of Rabbi Weinfield, who is careful to add the shvah-nagh, komatz katan, and hataf komatz katan.</p>
<p>Logically, it is not necessary, so you&rsquo;re right. But it is helpful to us forgetful readers (we&rsquo;re growing in numbers).</p>

<p>Bill,</p>
<p>The part about furtive patach/patach isn&rsquo;t so accurate. See my post (3.Aug.2008):
&ldquo;The Rule: Furtive patach is an a vowel that is added to the 3 gutturals: het, he &amp; ayin only when it’s preceded by a vowel other than a — you don’t want to apply the rule to any word-final het, he &amp; ayin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is why, Israel, no furtive patach here: <img src="/images/old-images/NoFP_6370.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The Aleppo Codex  shows clearly furtive patach. And  there are couple  of   &lsquo;rules&rsquo; that we don&rsquo;t follow now days.  The Leningrad Codex is identical to AC. The Cairo Ms. of the Prophets #22 is identical to AC, but the furtive patach is a little bit more to the right. 
(However, there is a controversy about furtive patach and pashta. But this is a different story.)</p>
<p>Bibles with or without furtive patach to the right (not the whole list, of course):
Adi — since day one, with furtive patach to the right (Dotan was the editor only around the 1970s)
Breuer (1989) — without; but Jerusalem Crown with furtive patach to the right.
Snaith,  Ginsburg, Cassuto  &amp; Hartom — without.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s no right or wrong. But, as I said, you don’t want to apply the rule to any word-final het, he &amp; ayin!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is an editorial decision. This isn&rsquo;t part of the nikud &amp; cantillation system.</p>
<p>Furtive Patach is a little bit more simple since we know that there are 3 gutturals. But shva is a little bit more complicated. There&rsquo;s no one rule. There&rsquo;s a chain reaction!!!</p>
<p>In order to talk or to know what is shav na (and nach) we need to know about syllabic stress &ndash;  mille&rsquo;el &amp; millera'; open &amp; closed syllables; dagesh kal &amp; hazak. And more, of course.</p>
<p>There are things more complicated. For example, shva  &ndash; na or nach &ndash; is affected by retracted accent.  In order to understand what is retracted accent you (not you in person) have to know the grammar of the cantillation!!!</p>
<p>See the example: the shva under the letter dalet is na (nun, ayin)!!! 
but when we read or study the whole verse  we are about to discover that the shva is nach!!! why? since of the the retracted accent.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, thanks. I haven&rsquo;t been following the thread in detail, so I missed your clear rule, above.</p>
<p>As a middle level student of Hebrew, the most frustrating part for me when it comes to pronunciation is where the accent goes, as dictionaries don&rsquo;t seem to indicate this. And as far as the the shva in the middle of the word, there seem to be no end of rules as to whether it is a shva na or shva nach! So it would helpful to us non-native speakers to have this indicated. My own rule of thumb is just treat everything as a schva nach if I possibly can, and if not then it&rsquo;s a shva na, and I pronounce it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I confess that much of what you say is like Greek to me, as they say.</p>
<p>You seem to understand what you are talking about (unlike my earlier incorrect conclusion).</p>
<p>In summary, you seem to suggest that the word with a shva (na or nach) is very complex. It is not only affected by the kind of letter ansd nikkud which preceded it, but that previous letter and nikkud is also affected by that which precedes them as well. Hence, it&rsquo;s a chain reaction&hellip;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there must be a clearly defined logic (aren&rsquo;t I obstinant? :) ). Even if the OpenType font has two or more consecutive contextual replacements for single shva-na because of the repeated conditions, then so be it. (So, the font is a few k bigger, and a second slower to process.)</p>
<p>Similarly, I am certain that the same procedures can be done for komatz katan and for hataf komatz katan.</p>
<p>If I am successful, I believe that learning and using these rules will become more common, and widespread.</p>
<p>What I found very fascinating in your recent and some of your earlier posts in a description of how one taam can predict the identity of the next one. I want to learn more about this in depth.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Talmud describes how Rabbi Akiva taught the meaning of the taggim (the ornaments on certain letters in a Torah scroll). I want very much to understand this well, as there must be a direct relationship between particular taggim over certain letters, and particular taamin over these same letters as well.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with specific books or scholars that deal with this in detail?</p>

<p>Bill,
I hear you. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say than even native speakers  face the same problem. Once they&rsquo;re done with the final exam&hellip;that&rsquo;s it (much like trigonometry — now this  is Chainise to me). When you&rsquo;re around the subject almost 24/7 for many years — this is like second nature (even as a student  I was a private tutor — students + high school students).<br>
And don&rsquo;t forget the shva merahef (hovering, hovers between voiced  &amp; silent shva)   :^)
I think this is the responsibility of the publisher and/or the editor &ldquo;to have this indicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Allow me to rephrase: Are you familiar with specific books or scholars that deal with defining the rules of<br>
a) shva-na in detail,
b) komatz katan,
c) hataf komatz katan ?</p>
<p>I know that there are different sets of rules for shva-na, but most Orthodox publishers follow only one set of rules. I am only interested in that one.</p>
<p>William,</p>
<p>Many nativwe speakers do not make any pronunciation difference between shva-na and shva-nach, as David mentioned. But two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right, as they say. I really think that they don&rsquo;t even know there is a difference.</p>
<p>Only some Orthodox readers are careful to make a distiction, but many are aware that there is a difference.</p>
<p>Most Orthodox publishers print either an asterisk or a short horizontal line above the letter, to indicate that the shvah below the letter is in deed a shvah-na.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Rabbinic Assembly (the Convervative prayerbook), the Reform, or JTS, make this distinction. I don&rsquo;t believe the Chistians (Southern Baptists and Catholics) do this as well. I may be wrong though.</p>
<p>I guess the only way to pronounce Hebrew correctly is to become Orthodox. :)</p>

<p>Israel,</p>
<p>I think that you are missing something. This is an editorial decision. Maybe contact the publisher, talk to the editor. Since you mentioned &ldquo;Convervative prayerbook, the Reform, Orthodox&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, we have different halakhic points of view!!! Maybe find a Rabbi, or couple of them and talk to them. 
To illustrate my point: The word Katonti (Gen. 32:11) is punctuated with geresh — Breuer, Adi, BHS (red arrow, Adi); and revi&rsquo;a — Koren bible, Mikraot Gedolot (blue arrow, Koren)
<img src="/images/old-images/Katonti_4098.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s  right? Who&rsquo;s wrong?   The answer is we have different halakhic points of view.  The same thing with shva, kamats etc etc. One School says this is kamats katan, the other one says — no. 
Unless, your plan is to have: FrankRuhl Reform, FrankRuhl Orthodox, FrankRuhl Convervative,   etc. etc.</p>
<p>True, we have rules. But sometimes we need to understand not just the rules. See the next example:</p>
<ol>
<li>First word: you see the hiriq (blue; kaf), and shva (red; lamed)?  The shva is na.</li>
<li>Second word: you see the hiriq  and shva? The shva is nach. 
<img src="/images/old-images/2shva_5952.gif" alt="">
Why is that?  Read/study Norzi  — remember my list?   :^)</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you want to know a little bit more about furtive patach? Read/study Abraham ben Meir ibn Ezra.</p>

<p>Israel said: &raquo;  I know that there are different sets of rules for shva-na, but most Orthodox publishers follow only one set of rules. I am only interested in that one.</p>
<p>David said: &raquo; Israel,</p>
<p>I think that you are missing something. This is an editorial decision. Maybe contact the publisher, talk to the editor. Since you mentioned “Convervative prayerbook, the Reform, Orthodox&hellip;.” &hellip;Unless, your plan is to have: FrankRuhl Reform, FrankRuhl Orthodox, FrankRuhl Convervative, etc. etc.</p>
<p>My response:</p>
<p>As a Lubavitch chassidic Jew, called an Orthodox baal teshuva, and raised in a Reform Judaism home, and having worked professionally for various Conservative Judaism entities to produce a semi-Conservative kind of Orthodox-like siddur or prayerbook, I can confidentally state that there is no such thing as &ldquo;FrankRuhl Reform, FrankRuhl Orthodox, FrankRuhl Convervative, etc. etc. &quot; It does not exist.</p>
<p>When it comes to the graphic symbol for shvah-nah and its usage, or komatz katan, or hataf-komatz katan, there are only different halachic views.</p>
<p>In the Conservative siddur, they do not exist, although the traditional nusach formulated by the Anshei Knesset Hagedola and latter great sages is maintained albeit with some minor changes.</p>
<p>Among the Reform, this exists even less and less and less etc. etc., and things like shvah-nah, komatz katan, or hataf-komatz katan certain do not exist at all. I doubt if most Reform rabbis even know these very words! Sorry, William, but I said most, like 98%.</p>
<p>My intention is make a FrankRuhl, David, Koren, Hadasa etc. that have automatic features for shvah-nah, komatz katan, or hataf-komatz katan, like SBL-Hebrew has for the furtive patach. That&rsquo;s my goal.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s dobable; you did not, but are reconsidering&hellip;</p>
<p>You know Hebrew grammar well, much more that I do (but I know OpenType more than you (I&rsquo;m not talking in FontLab), so you must realize it is in deed possible, since we are dealing with defineable rules. That&rsquo;s what grammar is all about.</p>
<p>I believe if it&rsquo;s done and used by all schools and appears in Hebrew nikkud books, then the next generation will understand it well, and pronounce Hebrew correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an editorial decision.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that there are different views in Halacha.</p>
<p>But I also disagree, because only one view is used by most publishers (except for Eliyahu Koren a&quot;h regarding some issues - and his view is rejected by the majority).</p>
<p>BTW, thank you for detailing the examples with important explanations. I choose not to discuss it here, because my point from the very beginning is only to incorporate the majority view in an automatic manner in a carefully crafted OpenType font.</p>
<p>The discussion of these points should be in another thread.</p>

<p>On second thought, your examples perhaps provide a key, and do pertain a great deal to this thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>First word: you see the hiriq (blue; kaf), and shva (red; lamed)? The shva is na.
2. Second word: you see the hiriq and shva? The shva is nach.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it isn&rsquo;t the chirik which is the determining factor, rather the preceding letter joined with a chirik.</p>
<p>I am certain that there is never the same set of a particular letter with a particular nikkud before a letter with a shvah, and sometimes it&rsquo;s shvah-nah and sometimes shvah-nach. (If you can find such a situation, then that means you need two preceding letters with two kinds of nikkud to determine if the third letter with a shvah is in deed a shvah-nah, or a shvah-nach - I don&rsquo;t know if OpenType could programmed in that way easily, but in a different way, it could be address - but it may not be even necessary.)</p>
<p>Once we figure out a list of letters with nikkud which cause cetain letters with shah which follow to be either shavah-nah or shvah-nach, a table or replacement can be created.</p>
<p>You know examples very well, and I see patterns very well.</p>
<p>(Similarly, regarding komatz katan and hataf-komatz katan.)</p>
<p>Either you discover the grammatical rule, or you &ldquo;reinvent the wheel&rdquo; so to speak, and &ldquo;reverse engineer&rdquo; it.</p>

<p>Now that I notice this, thanks to this discussion, I appreciate it. But I do find the way they do it typographically questionable. It seems to me a somewhat larger two dots, or maybe a light third dot make more sense, though I haven&rsquo;t seen it tried so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a distinctive kamatz katan in either book. If I remember rightly the Conservative Siddur, Sim Shalom, has this, in the form of a larger kamatz.</p>
<p>Israel, it really astonishes me that you don&rsquo;t seem to know or care&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know which&ndash;that your comments about Reform rabbis are lashon hara. Your claim that 98% of Reform rabbis don&rsquo;t even know what a kamatz katan is, is also absurd and false.</p>

<p>These two are Orthodox. I never saw a graphic symbol for a shvah-nah any where else, except Kehot (Lubavitch) Publication Society (a small floating asterisk), Shay Lemorah (Rabbi Winefeld of Jerusalem) (a little larger asterisk surround with a circle - very logical way to draw the reader&rsquo;s attention), and some small private Israeli Sephardic publishers).</p>
<p>Komatz katan is distinguished by both Orthodox (Kehot and I think ArtScroll do not), Conservative, and secular publishers.</p>
<p>I have seen Hataf komatz katan only in Shay Lemorah. I think only Rabbi Winefield knows its rule. :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you don’t seem to &hellip; care &hellip; [about] lashon hara.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I care. Like Tefillin is a mitzvah, so too not speaking lashon hora is also a mitzvah. In fact, lashon hora was a major factor for me to adobt the Chassidic lifestyle after being raised as a Reform Jew.</p>
<p>It is not lason hora to say someone knows something or not. I am reporting on his behavior, as &ldquo;so-in-so complain about Agri, and he eats non-kosher - what a hypocrite!&rdquo; This constitutes lashon hora if it is not common knowledge of the person&rsquo;s disregard for kosher laws. For example, many non-Orthodox Jews adhere to kosher laws. Therefore, we must assume that this person does not violate them.</p>
<p>Most very well educated people lack familiarity about shvah-nah (as you see that really only David knows what&rsquo;s flying here) etc. Hence, likely, most Reform rabbis do not know this either. I might be wrong. But I grew up Reform, interacted with many Reform rabbis, and can confidentally declare that the knowledge of these rules are very likely lacking by the over-whelming majority.</p>
<p>Sad to say, most Reform rabbis know much more about contemporary politics and social trends than Torah teachings and the meaning behind our traditions.</p>
<p>Today, Reform Judaism is much more like a social club than a religion. Many years ago, Reform Judaism, like its name implies, was a reaction against Orthodoxy and ancient traditions. Very few Reform Jews even know or care about those issues.</p>
<p>We even have seen recently that the trend is to accept a very simple conversion process, because the rate of intermarriage is the norm now. Plus, more Jews abandon Reform Judaism than enter into it, and the so-called converts are making up a larger percentage of Reform.</p>
<p>Even the previous president of Reform cried on television when he reported the statistic that within 50 years there will no longer be a Jewish componant to Reform.</p>

<p>For a start, there are several examples of a kamatz katan in the Shabbat Kiddush, which Reform also recite regularly, and I always hear it correctly from the lips of Reform Rabbis. Reform Rabbis have extensive training in Hebrew, including a year in Israel. Also, just checking the curriculum at huc.edu, there are several semesters of required studies in dikduk. I am not saying that their Hebrew is as good as a well educated native speaker, like David, nor do they pretend it is, but it is certainly way above what you indicate.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>According to my limited understanding (I haven&rsquo;t been Reform for close to 30 years), Reform  is in deed growing, but the born Jewish element is shrinking. Children of Reform parents are not becoming Reform, like their parents, by a very high percentage. Affiliation is any organized group is getting smaller, if we consider Jewish people as a whole.</p>
<p>Only Chabad House and Friends of Lubavitch is growing by big numbers. I&rsquo;m not tooting my own horn, but Chabad representatives seem to have discovered the secret ingrediant to appeal to the mainstrean, and even to gentiles. Without compromise, with black hats and scaggly untrimmed beards.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I saw it myself on PBS, during the big debate about the very unpopular &lsquo;Who is a Jew?&rsquo; issue of the very late eighties and very erly nineties. I&rsquo;m sure PBS has a written text of that interview, if not the actual recording. Even as a Chassidic Jew, I was very moved by his crying and shocking statement. He said: &ldquo;Our children don&rsquo;t want to be Reform; soon, we&rsquo;ll only have the converts.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore what you are doing is lashon hara. &hellip; Reform Rabbis have extensive training in Hebrew, including a year in Israel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right and I am wrong. I prefer to think that Jews know, as we are the &ldquo;people of the book&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this constitutes lashon hora. I will ask some experts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a false rumor that it is lashon hara.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I beg to differ. A false rumor is not lashon hora. It&rsquo;s simply a mistake.</p>
<p>If the intent is malicious, it&rsquo;s not nice, even mean.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s embarassing, or causes people to think less of Jews, it may be Chillul Hashem, an embrassment to G-d&rsquo;s stature.</p>
<p>I think if an outsider reading this thread is not caused to think poorly of Judaism or G-d. The person simply realizes that Reform Judaism and its rabbis are not representative of mainstream Judaism, the Torah, or G-d.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not a Chilul Hashem; it is rather a Kidush Hashem, a way to show G-d is special and holy.</p>
<p>I know that you regard Reform Judaism in a high regard, but in both Orthodoxy and the Conservative Judaism, it is regarded in a very low light (mainly because Reform Judaism claims it replaces Orthodoxy - the issue of dramatic compromise or even the promotion of anti-Halachic practices is not a reason to reject Reform Judaism - in halacha this is called &lsquo;horaat shaah&rsquo;, temporary laxity due to the circumstances).</p>
<p>I did ask about lashon hora and knowledge. The first reply that I received was that even if it would not be lashon hora,  intonation is a major factor. Here, however, everything is written only. So, the determining factors is limited to words in writting.</p>

<p>You make a clear assumption to declare that one lacks knowledge of something, even if it&rsquo;s untru, is slander.</p>
<p>To support your assumption, you cite a verse.</p>
<p>You do this over and over and over, regardless of my repeated replies that this is not a given.</p>
<p>You might be right, and I made a mistake; or, you might be wrong, and repeated errors can not simply be a mistake.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking you are correct, and no other possibility can exist, why don&rsquo;t we be a little humble, and seek the oipinions of those greater in wisdom than us.</p>
<p>I am not an expert in the laws of lashon hora, nor are you. Or are you?</p>
<p>I know some Reform rabbis, and will inquire simply about a one paragraph definition of a komatz katan. I will ask ten rabbis. If the majority (6 or more) answer correctly, it warrants my seeming besearching of the holy Reform rabbis shlit&quot;a. If 6 or more fail to reply, or reply incorrectly, then it would seem it is not untrue.</p>

<p>I lived in Israel, and spoke Hebrew. I have made over 100 Hebrew fonts, with Hebrew letters, nikkud, and taamei mikra. I have studied many hundreds of Hebrew language books in the original.</p>
<p>Do you really think this? If yes, I really held you in much higher regard. Did I make a crude mistake?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is morphological or etymological.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may be a knowledgeable Hebrew grammar teacher, and a fine Hebrew type designer, but I believe here you are incorrect.</p>
<p>Morphology (linguistics), the study of the structure and content of word forms. -Wikipedia</p>
<p>Etymology is the study of the history of words — when they entered a language, from what source, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. -Wikipedia</p>
<p>I think that the difference between declaring a shvah as either a shvah-nah or as a shvah-nach is purely grammatical. It neither relates to the structure and content of a word&rsquo;s form, or to its history.</p>
<p>For an intelligent person as yourself this is merely a way to save face, and pretend you know, when you really do not.</p>
<p>Look at William, when he does not know something, he searches and finds out.</p>
<p>Pirkei Avot declares that one who is shy does not learn, because he&rsquo;s afraid to ask. In order to learn, you must admit that you do not know, and seek out knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name one [secular] publisher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I began making Hebrew fonts back in 1988/89, I read documentation from Apple Computer, Inc. about Hebrew encoding standards, and inspected Hebrew system fonts from Apple with a bit map font editor tool.</p>
<p>I found a komatz katan, and wondered what it was. I never saw one before, nor in ulpan years before no discussion centered around it.</p>
<p>As a Lubavitcher chassidic, I prayed daily, and knew that on Saturday night we recited a prayer called &ldquo;Vetayn Lecha&rdquo; that featured the final version of chof with a komatz and a dagesh, and a final version of nuhn with a komatz. But there was no komatz katan in the entire prayerbook.</p>
<p>I was an authorized Apple developer and called Apple in Cupertino, California. In those days, you could talk to someone. The person that I spoke to was the Hebrew language manager, a former Israeli (chiloni - secular).</p>
<p>I questioned his decision to encode kometz katan, but not character ligatures used in a prayerbook.</p>
<p>He answered that he never read in a prayerbook, and was unaware of these character ligatures&hellip; that no one prayed anyway&hellip; and that komatz katan was used in schools teaching children to read.</p>
<p>I replied that in a few years, many more religious people, children, teenagers, and adults, will use computers, and secular will eventually dwindle in number and know Hebrew poorly (as we see already beginning today).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[about Reform rabbis not knowing things like katan] why say that? Do you know?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much for sure. I hope that there are a small percentage that know. Most Reform rabbis or students who were making their career to be Reform rabbis, know very little about Torah, Judaism and Hebrew, sad to say. They knew a lot about social issues, politics, movies, and how best to inspire people. They would make great social workers or therapists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know what is kamats katan?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like shvah-nah and shvah-nach, hataf-komatz katan and komatz katan, and an ordinary komatz (gadol), I understand the issue pertains to pronunciation.</p>
<p>Nah means moving; nach mean resting: when a shvah-nah appears we only slightly pronounce the sound of the consonant above the shvah; when a shvah-nach appears we do pronounce (a little more than slightly) the sound of the consonant above the shvah.</p>
<p>Katan means small; gadol means big: a consonant with a ordinary komatz (gadol) below it is pronounced with a big, full sound; a consonant with a komatz katan below it is pronounced with a small, shorter sound; a consonant with a ordinary hataf-komatz katan below, quicker sound.</p>
<p>I may be wrong. I am a type designer, not a grammaratarian, nor a Reform rabbi. :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have samples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have my books here. I will ask one of my sons for some.</p>
<p>Rabbi Winefield of Shay Lemorah publishers has it all. He also wrote the Shay Lemorah commentary. It appears he&rsquo;s a gigantic scholar that only appears only after many generations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>accusing someone of professional incompetence is serious lashon hara.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that you believe that not knowing a thing as rare as a komatz katan is professional incompetence for a Reform rabbi. I don&rsquo;t believe that not knowing a thing as rare as a komatz katan is certainly not professional incompetence for any rabbi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I see you are impervious to correction&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not impervious to correction at all.</p>
<p>Rather, you feel that there is nothing except your view. And hence you draw only one conclusion, refusing to consider that you may be incorrect, and that another possibility exists.</p>
<p>Although I am frum, and considered narrow-minded by many secularists or non-frum people, when a person refuses to consider more than one possibility and that only he or she is correct, then this is clearly being narrow minded.</p>
<p>This recent display of stubborn shallow thinking convinces me that secular or non-frum attitudes is in deed lacking a lot. No wonder so many reject it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remember that I simply am seeking to better understand the usage of shvah-nah, komatz katan, hataf komatz katan, and even the meteg accent mark, in order to incorporate these grammar rules into a crefully crafted OpenType Hebrew font, like SBL-Hebrew.</p>
<p>Instead of assistance or encouragement, a debate has ensued about the merits of Reform Judaism, its rabbis, and I have been accused of lashon hora for speaking sharply about Reform Judaism and against Reform rabbis.</p>
<p>The very fact that the inquiry about these Hebrew grammar topics have produced very little shows how very little we know about them, besides their names.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that not knowing a thing as rare as a komatz katan is certainly not professional incompetence for any rabbi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Israel, you are not getting it. Conservative and Reform congregations these days pray using the Israeli pronunciation of Hebrew (with an American accent). In it, a patach and kamatz are pronounced the same, but a kamatz katan is pronounced differently. Thus in order to pronounce the prayers properly, you have to be aware that &lsquo;kol&rsquo; (all) is pronounced that way rather than &lsquo;kal&rsquo;. So Reform kids today in elementary school are taught about the existence of the kamatz katan in their early Hebrew classes. And that&rsquo;s why some prayer books for Reform and Conservative print the kamatz katan differently. That&rsquo;s why your statement that 98% of Reform Rabbis don&rsquo;t know of the existence of the kamatz katan is so absurd.</p>
<p>Now do you understand?</p>

<p>Fascinating explanation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you are correct that this distiction is so widespread throughout the movement. I would like to do some researchg. Your statement might be as accurate, as it is plausable. (As I abhor lashon hora, I believe in limud zchus, like the American legal rule of &ldquo;innocense until proven guilty&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If your explanation is in deed accurate, then every Reform rabbi should know the basics of komatz katan (pronunciation) in order to pray.</p>

<p>As the Talmud makes clear, judging &ldquo;l&rsquo;chaf z&rsquo;chut&rdquo; means that you try to put a good construction on what the other person does, or in other words try to view their action with the best interpretation, in the most favorable light.</p>
<p>But here you say you have had no contact with Reform for thirty years, but are willing both to judge in the worst light and than to say publicly that 98% of Reform Rabbis have never heard of a kamatz katan. If that is judging &lsquo;l&rsquo;chaf z&rsquo;chut,&rsquo; and avoiding lashon hara, then I&rsquo;m the Pope of Rome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>disparage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To know or not know komatz katan is to disparage? Come on!?!</p>
<p>This sounds like grade school, and the teacher catches a kid with a comic book, shouting: &ldquo;Ah, hah, do you know that this act could lead to World War III?!?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I repeat my accusation, because it’s true, and according to Torah I have the obligation to rebuke, but only three times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accusation, true???</p>
<p>Everything in Jewish law, known as halacha, has a context and a &ldquo;geder&rdquo; - a framework, of where the rule applies, and where it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When you study Jewish ideas and rules, you learn these matters, possibly even in depth, but your vast knowledge lacks understanding a rule&rsquo;s &ldquo;geder&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think that this is the case of your understanding of &ldquo;limud z&rsquo;chus&rdquo; and &ldquo;lashon hora&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but only three times. So I’m done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is childish, and immature.</p>
<p>First, this rule of three times has a &ldquo;geder&rdquo; too. It refers to three different scenarios, not three each the same, as here. You must take me aside in private, say by private email, and do this three times, in different contexts or scenarios.</p>
<p>Second, the laws of rebuke also have a &ldquo;geder&rdquo;. No one can simply rebuke anyone. Basically, you may not rebuke those &ldquo;younger&rdquo; in knowledge, or &ldquo;older&rdquo; in knowledge. You may only rebuke a person of equal standing, who you can influence for good. Here, age is not measured by calender years, but by knowledge of Torah and practice of halacha (although age is a strong factor for honor even if the person lacks knowledge of Torah).</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>If the other person is not on equal standing with you, then your rebuke will not influence them for good. And if this happens, the &ldquo;aveira&rdquo;, the resulting transgressions, are your fault too, not only that person&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>So, we see that giving a rebuke is complicated.</p>
<p>Regarding those that are &ldquo;younger&rdquo; in knowledge, or &ldquo;older&rdquo; in knowledge, the correct way to rebuke is by educating the person.</p>
<p>If the person is older and wiser, like a rabbi or teacher, one says: &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t we learn such and such in (and then cite the source?)?</p>
<p>If the person is younger and less knowledgeable, like a child or ignorant (in Torah knowledge) person, we explain kindly and patiently.</p>
<p>If the person is of equal standing, and the rebuke fails to have an impact, we are not allowed to feel: &ldquo;So I’m done.&rdquo; Rather, then, one is obliged to confront the two person&rsquo;s respected authority figure, and report that the other person committed such and such offence, was rebuked in such and such manner, but failed to change.</p>
<p>Then, one&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>This is clearly explained in the Codes of Jewish Law, and even translated in English by a few different parties.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that these ideas in halacha are learned, but their &ldquo;geder&rdquo; is ignored.</p>

<p>a kamatz katan is pronounced differently</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud</a> in deed the pronunciation difference of modern Hebrew between a regular kamatz (an &ldquo;ah&rdquo;-like sound), and a kamatz katan.</p>
<p>When I was a boy, and learning in a Reform Judaisn Sunday school, the prononciation taught to us was not for modern Hebrew, or Sephardic. Rather, Ashkenazic pronunciation was taught, and this distinction was not taught at all, as it was not not necessary.</p>
<p>Also, in various ulpanin (schools of Hebrew language in Israel), where I was taught pronunciation for modern Hebrew, no distinction was taught. Similarly, on a kibbutz-ulpan, at college age, I never was taught about the kamatz katan.</p>
<p>Only in my late twenties, when I became a professional type design on the Apple Macintosh computer, did I discover the existance of a kamatz katan. I learned that it was sounded like a kamatz, but was shorter in the length of its sound, and hence called the &ldquo;small kamatz&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&hellip;please be advised that the &ldquo;kamatz katan&rdquo; is a very important part of Hebrew grammar&hellip; It IS taught as part of the Reform Movement&rsquo;s Hebrew curriculum&hellip;</p>
<p>Rabbi Sharon L. Sobel
Executive Director
Canadian Council for Reform Judaism and ARZA Canada</p>
<p>According to this statement, Reform Judaism schools clearly teach use of the kamatz gadol &ldquo;as part of the Reform Movement&rsquo;s Hebrew curriculum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hence, I was incorrect in stating that Reform rabbis do not know kamatz katan today.</p>
<p>In my defence, I clearly recall that when I was a child in a Reform Judaism Sunday school never learning about it. Also, in interacting with both many Reform rabbis in the USA over the years, and with many Reform rabbinical students in Jerusalem, I didn&rsquo;t find them knowledgeable understandingly about issues of Jewish law (halacha) or the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>If Rabbi Sharon Sobel is correct, perhaps Reform has reformed during the past three decades, or the movement and certain affiliate temples and schools embrace this knowledge, but the bulk is much less knowledgeable.</p>
<p>According to William&rsquo;s explanation that a kamatz and patach represent an &ldquo;ah&rdquo; sound, like the Sephardic-style puctuation used in Israel, and the kamatz katan represents the &ldquo;oh&rdquo; sound, how did Askenazic Jews traditionally distinquish between there &ldquo;oh&rdquo; sounding kamatz and kamatz katan?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I received the following very explicit statement from &ldquo;Ask a Rabbi&rdquo; at the Reform Judaism web site.</p>
<p>&hellip;please be advised that the &ldquo;kamatz katan&rdquo; is a very important part of Hebrew grammar&hellip; It IS taught as part of the Reform Movement&rsquo;s Hebrew curriculum&hellip;</p>
<p>Rabbi Sharon L. Sobel
Executive Director
Canadian Council for Reform Judaism and ARZA Canada</p>
<p>According to this statement, Reform Judaism schools clearly teach use of the kamatz gadol &ldquo;as part of the Reform Movement&rsquo;s Hebrew curriculum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hence, I was incorrect in stating that Reform rabbis do not know kamatz katan today.</p>
<p>In my defence, I clearly recall that when I was a child in a Reform Judaism Sunday school, I never learning about the kamatz katan. Also, in interacting with both many Reform rabbis in the USA over the years, and with many Reform rabbinical students in Jerusalem, I didn&rsquo;t find them knowledgeable understandingly about issues of even basic Jewish law (halacha) or the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>If Rabbi Sharon Sobel is correct, perhaps Reform has reformed during the past three decades, or the movement and certain affiliate temples and schools embrace this knowledge, but the bulk is much less knowledgeable.</p>
<p>According to William&rsquo;s explanation that a kamatz and patach represent an &ldquo;ah&rdquo; sound, like the Sephardic-style puctuation used in Israel, and the kamatz katan represents the &ldquo;oh&rdquo; sound, how did Askenazic Jews traditionally distinquish between there &ldquo;oh&rdquo; sounding kamatz and kamatz katan?</p>
<p>I know that William felt strongly that the honor of Reform rabbis or even the entire movement was lowered from my remark. This certainly was not my intention. So, I apologize if anyone thinks less of Reform rabbis because I said they sdon&rsquo;t know the meaning of kamatz katan.</p>
<p>Honestly, I admit that I am unsure, too. William said that it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;oh&rdquo; sound. So, too, say Wikipedia on the Internet. Is this for Ashkanazim, too? So, does that mean its just another vowel, and not a grammatical issue?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s another vowel, and not the result of a grammatical rule, then it is not possible to program itsappearance into OpenType, unless it follows some definable pattern. Strike kamatz katan.</p>

You may be a knowledgeable Hebrew grammar teacher [who said I was/am???]  and a fine Hebrew type designer, but I believe here you are incorrect.
it isn’t the chirik which is the determining factor, rather the preceding letter joined with a chirik.
In the two examples that you cite, there is no shvah-nah.
These six words do not feature the need for a furtive patach.
I think that the difference between declaring a shvah as either a shvah-nah or as a shvah-nach is purely grammatical. It neither relates to the structure and content of a word’s form, or to its history.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It apears that your reluctance to share your expertiose in Biblical Hebrew grammar stems from either of two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You think that it&rsquo;s just a waste of time to teach another this knowledge, because I am not a worthy recepient, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that your opinion is that this knowledge can not be used to create a contextual replacement in OpenType, like success has been made with furtive patach.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first reason is subjective and personal. If I posted as a picture a bearded long-haired woman, with rings along the side of my face, and not a Chassidic Jew with a kipah, maybe you would be condescending and agree&hellip;</p>
<p>The second reason assumes you have a valid reason for your conclusion, but you have not demonstrated it.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>When I worked professionally with the OpenType master John Hudson of SBL-Hebrew fame, I received greater respect and cooperation. He&rsquo;s a very proud Catholic and Biblical Hebrew expert.</p>
<p>I believe with a clear understanding of the applicartion of shva-na, kamatz katan, and hataf kamatz katan, similar achievements as were for the furtive patach can be accomplished.</p>
<p>I incorrectly believed that this understanding could be found here.</p>
<p>Instead, I mainly found opposition and narrow-mindedness. Good type design requires an open-mind, creativity, and an attitude of &ldquo;I can&rdquo;. not the opposite.</p>

<p>This was in deed a rude statement. You clearly do know a lot about Hebrew grammar. So, this was uncalled for by me - I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Not to justify, but to clarify, I was upset by your initial statement: &ldquo;So, give me a break with your Quotes of the Day: “Lamdeinu rabbeinu” &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was actually intended as a compliment.
After you made little of it, I made little of your words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what do you want from me, huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assist me to define an create a CSUB/CPOS rule in OpenType to address shva-na/shva-nach, kamatz-katan/hataf-kamatz-katan, somewhat like what John Hudson (and some other guy) did for the furtive patach.</p>
<p>Originally, you stated that this was not possible. Perhaps, you are right.</p>
<p>Paul Nelson, formerly of the Microsoft Typography Group refered me to Diane Collier, who expressed her view that she blieves that this is possible, based upon the information presented to her by me. So, perhaps, you are incorrect.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that you hope that I find a way to do this.</p>
<p>The result will mean that a Hebrew text in Unicode without Unicodes for shva-na, kamatz-katan, and hataf-kamatz-katan will then automatically appear and print with glyphs for shva-na, kamatz-katan, and hataf-kamatz-katan.</p>

<p>Please give me a recommended reading list, prioritized from 1 to 5. Do you know if I can get them at the Barnes and Nobles web site, or from some other place?</p>
<p>I read and understand scholarly Hebrew.</p>
<p>Usually, older books on Hebrew grammar, particularly great works from the Rishonim are out of print. There is a book store in Boro Park, Brooklyn, that has almost every book imaginable made up of bound photocopies.</p>
<p>Do you know Beigleheisen (sp) on 15th Avenue?</p>
<p>I know about Beigleheisen by coincidense. About 12 years ago, I published for test marketing purposes volume 13 of the Talmud, with most of it newly typeset totally with a private set of Hebrew typefaces which replicated the classic Vilna, Lithuania fonts, of the Widow and Brothers Romm family.</p>

<p>First, people think that I am very respectful etc.</p>
<p>I do respect John very much, and consider him both very talented and super-intelligent, but he is not my role model. Maybe, you define this term differently than me.</p>
<p>The Talmud teaches us that a wise person can learn from everybody. In that sense, everyone is my role model. John, William, even you ( :) just kidding).</p>
<p>Bob Dylan said that everybody sets an example, either a good one to emulate, or a bad one, not to follow.</p>
<p>As a chassidic Jew, my ultimate role model is the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe.</p>

<p>There are students that learn Introduction to Biblical Hebrew for two years (four semester course)!!! what do you think that I’m going to sit here and post 24/7? Get it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear possible to absorb what takes others two years, to do this and even more within a much shorter time.</p>
<p>I am unaware if this understanding exists yet in secular knowledge.</p>
<p>Chassidic thought explains that every person is endowed with two sets of talents: kochot giluim, and kochot ne&rsquo;ehlamim (tangible powers, and &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; powers).</p>
<p>Using our ordinary talents (kochot giluim, tangible powers), something like Biblical Hebrew may take two years to absorb. Using our unusual talents (kochot ne&rsquo;ehlamim, &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; powers), something like Biblical Hebrew can take even a short time to absorb.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>Koreen Publishing was purchased by another firm. In addition to creating a special typeface only for their Bible (based upon drawings of Ashkenazic sources), contravercial rules for Hebrew grammar were introduced as well. This was attributed to Mr. Koren. You say differently. I think you’re right, and they’re mistaken, confusing the name of the company with the details of contraversy maker.</cite></p>
<p>Just to set the record straight. Israel, please please please check your facts before posting on forums. I am going through all your posts to check for incorrect postings.</p>
<p>So firstly, Koren Publishers Jerusalem Ltd was bought out a year and a half ago. The typeface was created over 45 years ago. We are simply redigitising the font. It&rsquo;s identical to the original font created by Eliyahu Koren except rather than being cast in metal, it&rsquo;s being cast in OpenType :-)</p>
<p>The rules for Hebrew grammar that were used are the same. Nothing has changed for the past 45 years. The Bible was proofread for 10 years before being published.</p>
<p>As a fact, it is considered to be the most accurate Bible in Israel. Contrary to what Israel wrote, Charedim do not like Breuer. Breuer was an academic and actually it&rsquo;s the Modern Orthodox Gush Etzion Yeshiva bochurim that like Breuer. Charedim actually buy Koren. We have huge sales in Bnei Brak!</p>
<p>Finally you will find Koren Bibles in every shul, be it Ashkenaz, Sefard, Edot Mizrach, Moroccon or Yemenite. If anybody has a problem with the kriat hatorah, then the Rav of the shul, regardless of his ethnic, political or dress code, will invariably say, &ldquo;what does it say in the Koren&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Regarding your comments on kamatz katan, shva na and furtive patach. Yes the furtive patach can be encoded (we have done so in the digital version of the Koren fonts). However, you cannot encode a kamatz katan or shva na. The reason is that there are so many opinions as to when a shva na should be put as well as a kamatz katan. I, when starting at Koren, also thought that this would be a simple grammatical process, but after months of understanding the complexities, I realised that you can&rsquo;t encode the entire Bible with all it&rsquo;s opinions into a font. It also serves no function. What are you going to do if Publisher B wants to print his Bible and disagrees with the opinions that you have relied on for the meteg vs gaaya thus changing whether it should be kamatz katan or shva na?</p>
<p>In terms of siddurim with shva na at the beginning of a word. The Koren siddur which came out in 1981 has a shva na and shva nach indicated in the non-Tanakh parts of the siddur and the first letter is indicated as a shva na. I thought that this was daft since obviously it&rsquo;s a shva na, but Israel, you have proved Mr Koren correct in that some people think it&rsquo;s a shva nach!</p>

<p>I believe to create a set of fonts with automatic placement of kamatz katan and shva-na is possible.</p>
<p>In practicality, there are two systems; one is more generous with attributing a shva-na than the other; they do share 65% to 75% in common. although different context analysis is used for nikkud/meteg only data, than for Tanach data with taamim, because in Tanach data with taamim the meteg does not help determine certain shva-nas, but one of the taamim does this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple to generate two versions: Kehot=like, following Rav Henna&rsquo;s system, or ArtScroll-like folowing Vilna Gaon&rsquo;s system. What the customer pays for, the customer gets.</p>

<p>Again, you are talking without knowing the facts. I have our sales figues at hand, you don&rsquo;t. The army for the past few years has actually produced it&rsquo;s own illegal copy of our Bible so they haven&rsquo;t bought from us. Yes, tourists buy. And yes, even though you think you know what all Charedim in Israel do, it just so happens that you are completely wrong in this matter too and that we have very high volume sales of Koren Tanachim to Charedim here in Israel who need a pure text. But again, our sales have nothing to do with typography, but then again neither does Lubavitch Chasidism.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stick to the topics at hand. I know you are desperate to create a font that has kamatz katan and shva na grammar rules according to once system programmed into it. Good luck, I hope you find a system that works. It didn&rsquo;t work for Koren, but where one person fails, another can succeed.</p>
<p>But please, Scott, I implore you, please please please, don&rsquo;t post things which aren&rsquo;t true. If you wish to state your opinion, state it as an opinion not as a fact. You have written time and time again incorrect things about Koren and I wonder what other incorrect things you write and this does a diservice to every one here. Finally, why are you asking about grammar rules of such an esoteric topic such as taamey mikra on a forum for typography? Aren&rsquo;t you completely off-topic?</p>

<p>I ask myself this too each day.</p>
<p>But as the thread began, this subject of an automatic response, like the effect of the furtive patach, is an issue of OpenType&rsquo;s advanced programming in Volt, using the GSUB command in a creative way.</p>
<p>So, it is on topic (as you see, my interest is understanding how kamatz katan and shva-na can be derived fromcontext, not in the traditional grammatical way).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay, touche! But I think the problem here is your obsession of creating a perfect font which of course there is nothing wrong with, on the contrary, but&hellip; and here is the kicker, you need to define the scope of a perfect font.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you another secret, since, to date, I think I&rsquo;m the only person to have created a taamey mikra font to this complexity, I would strongly suggest that you first create the font that works within the scope of the full Tanakh (including sifrey emet), with no collisions and if you like with the furtive patach indicated like in Koren. Once you have succeeded in doing this and compiling such a font (no mean task) then see if you can make an &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; font which puts in automatic kamatz katan and shva na according to whatever system you decide on.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend you do this in this order. The task is monumental. As you create the font, you&rsquo;ll understand why I&rsquo;m saying to do in 2 stages. You need to compile the font at the end of the day and Volt is limited as to the number of instructions you can compile.</p>
<p>We have decided that first the font has to be kerned and have kerned every single pair (not just a few problematic ones). This took up a tremendous amount of space. We then decided to create a very accurate positioning system with very few compromises. Yes a kamatz, patach, tzere and segol are positioned the same, but they are different from a kamatz katan and a chataf kamatz and a chataf kamatz katan.</p>
<p>This all takes up valuable lines of code within the font. We are hoping that we will be able to compile the final font, but we are probably going to have a separate font for sifrey emet since the rules of taamim are different for these 3 books and I don&rsquo;t think the font will handle that.</p>
<p>This is why I say, wait with your &ldquo;intelligent features&rdquo; until you have your main face working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just received a commission from a community that wants me to create a siddur for them. They davka don&rsquo;t want a shva na but they do want a kamatz katan. How would you handle such a client? In my Koren font, I have a medium weight shva for such a situation and because it&rsquo;s not automatic I have no problem.</p>
<p>Also, you have only talked about Tanakh, but what if somebody wants to use your typeface for setting a siddur. Let&rsquo;s say they want your font because you have taamim for the shema but don&rsquo;t need it any thing else? If so, how would handle different rules for words from different periods of time. Eg how would you handle Yevarechcha which has no shva na because that rule didn&rsquo;t exist at the time of the Tanakh, or Ata rather than aTA from texts from the Rishonim?</p>
<p>Or is siddur not of any interest?</p>

<p>However, if you are distinguising visually between a kamatz katan and kamatz gadol (a recent invention), then you&rsquo;ll want to make the chataf kamatz (since it&rsquo;s katan) different too. Ie if you are enlarging the kamatz katan then your chataf kamatz will be enlarged too. If you are not distinguishing then you&rsquo;ll want the chataf kamatz to be a regular sized kamatz, so you&rsquo;ll need two glyphs in the font.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand where &amp; why there&rsquo;s a problem with Ata vs. aTA &ndash; or any other word ? We call it Nasog Ahor, retraction of the accent. This issue is a little bit complex  since  there&rsquo;re&hellip;. [I see my notes now] &hellip;.something around 40 rules + exceptions!!!!</p>
<p>Genesis 18 (the same word, of course). 
Sample #1 is verse 32: Milra (the letter resh); the bet is with sheva. 
Sample #2 is verse 30: Milel (the letter bet) , nasog ahor, and since of the nasog the bet is with tsere.
<img src="/images/old-images/Gen2_5142.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Psalms 89: 27, 76:8 &ndash; Ata vs. aTA</p>
<p>since of the nasog we change the patach to kamats; and the original position of the accent was under the tav.
<img src="/images/old-images/Ps89_5874.gif" alt="">
<img src="/images/old-images/Ps76_5399.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>BTW, Israel, sheva after Nasog Ahor is Na (and not Nach!). See the classic example (Genesis 21: 6)

<p>Prof. Aron Dotan also sincerely asked about the distinction between chataf kamatz and chataf kamatz katan. This indicates that he thinks there is validity of a distinction, but was asking what that distinction is, and whether he agrees with it, or not.</p>
<p>I cited examples which Shai Lemorah published (they are posted here) where what appears by most everyone as chataf kamatz should rather be chataf kamatz katan.</p>
<p>According Shai Lemorah&rsquo;s publisher, Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefels, there is clearly a difference.</p>
<p>Hence, if it alludes Prof. Dotam and inspire him to ask, I think Raphael - with all due respect - is not qualified to answer.</p>
<p>I search for similarly structure Hebrew words in Chumash, the Bible, Pentateuch, and sure enouth Shai Lemorah indicated that it needed not a kamatz katan, but rather a chataf kamatz katan. Furthermore, in Shai Lemorah printing the famous Zemirot which are sung on the Sabbath, chataf kamatz katan also appears.
.
.
The argument against the shva-na symbol being applied to Biblical verses is very weak. Even nikkudot, nor taamim, were not around when Moses received the Torah.</p>
<p>Obvious, the application of shva-na symbols is more than justified, as the pronuncition indicated b a shva-na sysbol always existed. At one point in time, we learned about it. Later, scholars as great as Rabbi David Kimchi at his time, or Rav Zalman Henna (Hanau) at his time, or Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefield in our time, introduced these symbols to us.</p>
<p>Just because in earlier times, knowledge of a symbol was not known is no valid reason that when it is known later, it can not be applied to text from an earlier time.</p>
<p>If this foolish assumption (no offence) was true, today people would eat each other alive, because coexistance was discovered at an earlier time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Israel,</p>
<p>Yet again you mix things up and misunderstand the point. Let me explain to you slowly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The kamatz gadol and kamatz katan are traditionally indicated visually in the same way. It&rsquo;s the same nikud representation and it&rsquo;s typically just called a kamatz. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some publishers in the past, typically of non-Ashkenazi siddurim, indicated it differently because that particular nusach pronounced it differently and not everyone reading the siddur was educated enough to know the difference. For example, I remember seeing a siddur from 1890s or so for the Spanish and Portuguese congregation which had a cut-off kamatz to indicate kamatz katan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rinat Yisrael Siddur in the 1970s and the Koren Siddur which came out in the 1980s were the first large-scale Ashkenazi siddurim to popularise the enlarged kamatz as a kamatz katan since in the Israeli pronunciation system, kamatz katan is pronounced differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all siddurim and chumashim however, make this distinction for many reasons. For example the Koren Tanakh doesn&rsquo;t have this distinction because the grammatical rules for determining kamatz katan is different for <i>sephardim</i> and <i>ashkenazim<i> and Elyahu Koren didn&rsquo;t want his Tanakh to be sectarian but rather for all of <i>am yisrael</i>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are <i>not</i> going to indicated the kamatz katan with an enlarged kamatz and are going to use the regular kamatz symbol for both kamatz katan and kamatz gadol (eg Artscroll and thousands of other Jewish publications over the centuries), then you are going to use the regular chataf kamatz symbol even though of course it is always pronounced &ldquo;oh&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are going to indicated kamatz katan by using a separate glyph, then there is a strong argument for using a similarly enlarged chataf kamatz for all chataf kamatzim since they are all katan. One could argue that this is moot since they are all katan in the same way one could argue that making the shva at the beginning of a word larger to indicate a shva na is daft because the shva at the beginning of a word is always shva, however, Israel has already demonstrated that at least one person in the world (who happens to be Israel) thought that all shvas at the beginnning of the word were nach! Therefore for the benefit of Israel, I would recommend all publishers making the chataf kamatz enlarged if they are making the kamatz katan larger.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That was point about the kamatz katan and the chataf kamatz katan. And, I should add, I may not be a grammarian, but I have typeset 2 siddurim (the new Singer&rsquo;s (UK) and the new Koren (USA/OU)), 5 chumashim (one for Chabad I might add) and the entire 2nd edition of Encylopedia Judaica including the complicated article on Masora in which I sat for many hours with Prof. Dotan (mentioned somewhere on these threads). If that doesn&rsquo;t make me qualified on a typography forum, I&rsquo;m not what does.</p>
<p>In reference to the shva na. I&rsquo;m not sure what you are saying. I&rsquo;m not saying that the shvas shouldn&rsquo;t be distinguished in a Tanakh, I&rsquo;m just pointing out that it&rsquo;s not. To date, an accurate Tanakh with shva na and shva nach indicated doesn&rsquo;t yet exist. We at Koren are producing one, but it&rsquo;s many many years away.</p>
<p>Interestingly you don&rsquo;t bring up indicating dagesh chazak and dagesh kal&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally, Israel, you confuse many topics into one. You seem to talk about:
a) what should be encoded on the Unicode standards
b) what publishers should do
c) what you think should be hard-encoded into a font
d) what the rebbe would have done in such a situation
e) you ask advise about grammar and then act as though you are an expert based on what you have learned on the thread 5 minutes earlier
f) disseminating incorrect information about various topics (is that just to get people to write back and argue with you)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, after all these months of ranting, have you actually created a single font that works?</p>

<p>After a few more posts, you know after the ice stated to melt, and David cited millions of examples (I think Mike got involved too), David explain there were strong and weakdagesges.</p>
<p>Is that what you mean?</p>
<p>If so, how do we know a dagesh is chazak strong or kal weak?</p>
<p>When it breaks rule, we say that normally its weak, but here its strong. And save face.</p>

<p>Come on, I did not.</p>
<p>The Rebbe was in for of not changing thew status quo when it came to books.</p>
<p>In fact, he was againt retypesetting classic works. Why? Because why one retypesets, new printers' errors result.</p>
<p>Even though for me he blessed my desire to retypeset the Talmud etc. Why? Because I don&rsquo;t make typos? Sure, I make a lot more typos than you! If I had a dollar for typo, Warren Buffet would sweep my floor for Shabbat. &ldquo;Here, Warren, you missed this corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not to say, the Rebbe followed the status quo. In 1951, after he became Rebbe, he pulled out of Agudat Yisroel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk talk talk about kiruv, we gonna do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made Chabad Houses. In the early, one day they will everywhere. Today, Chabad House are in more places in the world than Coca-Cola. Today, Lubavitch is the fastest growing biggest influence in Jewish world. You know it in your own life.</p>
<p>William, in the next few decades Reform will go the way of the maskilim. A thing of the past.</p>

<p>Yes, many.</p>
<p>I am a professional type design in non-Roman languages.</p>
<p>In the last three months, with the professional help from Diane Collier (highly recommended by the MicroSoft Typography Group) and with a very close working relationship with John Hudson (he never heard of Tzika - such a liar -0 you well for his non-Shomer Shabbat skills - yes the Koren Bible was made through Hilul Shabbat - nowonder Cheredim don&rsquo;t want it), I have mastered Volt.</p>
<p>My goal is to make 100 Biblical Hebrew face in 2009. Most of which will be sold commercially, as I described earlier. Some will be reserved for me to use exclusively to retypeset all the classic books produced by Romm and others. Then, I will release then.</p>
<p>Crown (my Koren) I won&rsquo;t release until after you do not to hinder your sales. In the USA, design is not protected by US Copyright laws. Patent is, but I doubt if you&rsquo;ll or Tzvika will patent it.</p>
<p>To answer your question: 2 Frankruhls (which you saw), 2 Henris (Hadasa), 2 Milons (New Hadasa-like, 1 AchimRomm-Dark, very soon a lot more.</p>

<p>Now, I wish someone would define clearly what differs between a long and short vowel. William, please explain.</p>
