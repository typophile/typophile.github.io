  logo.\r\nOr anything that's in that category.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LOGO
  air asia_6302.jpg]\r\n\r\nI know for some time that this site has experienced members
  who know fonts more than anyone.\r\nSo, hopefully somebody can help and suggest
  me fonts that have similar script/handwritten character.\r\nThank you heaps."
