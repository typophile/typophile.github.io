  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>o.k. so i want to make some personal t-shirts and am wondering what are some cost effective ways to do it and interesting techniques. Any ideas? (It might be easy to make the film positive myself but i would probably go to a shop to do the rest. Also any other specialty techniques like flock or puff printing that i should know of?)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like most of the standard t-shirt materials or the way they are printed for like sports teams and stuff. I love the thick tinted OBEY t-shirts. I am also looking for different types of inks or coats or whatever to give the shirts a high quality look.</p>
<p>Also I know most of the cost in printing t&rsquo;s is the setup. So if i can prepare anything for the setup to reduce costs that would be sweet. The shirts i want are probably going to be 1-colour so its easier.</p>
<p>Thanks,
-jesse</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Generally, the major portion of the cost of producing silkscreened apparel is not the setup, but the apparel itself, and perhaps even more so in your case, since you expressed a preference for a more &ldquo;upscale&rdquo; substrate. For personal-use projects, you will probably be best off contacting local apparel silkcreeners, and comparing costs. If you want to get into the business of producing screend apparel, you would probably be best served by having your designs printed first on thermal transfer paper, then applied via heat press to the garments. The advantages to this method are (1) less upfront cost (the paper is MUCH cheaper than the garments); (2) virtually no spoilage (unless the heat press operator is a total dunce); and (3) little or no &ldquo;dead&rdquo; inventory (if certain designs do not sell well, you are not stuck with imprinted garments you will most likely have to sell at a loss).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Are there good places online to do under 5 designs for flock? Or should i go to a screen printer near me? (oh also i am considering doing a website for a screenprinter near me in exchange for free screenprinting :P)</p>
<p>Aluminum, can you explain that process a bit?</p>
<p>oldnick, Do you reccommend any good apparel? Are their any ways to treat standard apparal to give them superior quality? (OBEY has some shirts that seem to have some kind of metalic added to them)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t forsee myself getting into the t-shirt business, but then i might like it and end up going that route lol. Has anyone done this before? Right now i don&rsquo;t have the time or space to do it all myself, although i would like to. I just need some nice t&rsquo;s to wear and everything in stores seems to be based on maximalism, skulls and crosses; or any combination of the three.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You want to make sure that you&rsquo;re using the best quality shirt that you can (Fruit of the Loom and Gildan are great): while you can buy them in limited ranges of colours on your own, the only way to get the more offbeat ones is through a good pro shop.</p>
<p>Trading your web skills would be a great way to reduce/eliminate the set-up/printing end of things to have access to the quality shirts in a wide colour range, actually: I may do that next time, because the company I usually use has a really crappy site.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ve done a couple of 75-100 shirt runs and used a reputable local firm that had great service.  We let them do all the prepress stuff for the front, since we were using a linoblock print as the graphic, and I did all the typography on the sleeves, but the cost was still only about $15 Canadian for the short-sleeve version and under $20 for the long-sleeves.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are a lot of shirts that FOTL make that you never see commercially (i.e., the realm of custom shirt producers, and that, so far as I know, aren&rsquo;t available retail: you can always Google suppliers you like) &ndash; and I should have added Hanes BeefyT to that list.  I&rsquo;ve got one American Apparel shirt, but am not that impressed, comparatively, with it.</p>
<p>The first place I used here does a lot of work, but I&rsquo;m just not impressed with the overall quality of their image repro sometimes, and a lot of their stuff tends to be more of the &ldquo;throwaway&rdquo; kind of shirt: in fact, the last one self-destructed a few years ago.  It&rsquo;s not total crap, but it really impressed upon me the need to spend a little more money.</p>
<p>Next time I did shirts, I spent the extra $$$ and have used them ever since: I hope the folks you deal with are more like my latter and not the former.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple of my shirts hidden away &ndash; I keep them stashed away for special occasions <grin> &ndash; let me charge up the batteries for my camera and I&rsquo;ll post some pix up later.</p>

<p>Your Milage May Vary.</p>
<p>Thanks, I like &lsquo;em too: nice and warm, being 100% preshrunk cotton. :-) The colour is something Hanes calls Cardinal, if memory serves (more accurate in the first pic) &ndash; these are a few years old.  If you scroll to the far right side of the top photo, you&rsquo;ll see the placement of the type.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s silkscreened.  Friend of mine did the front as a limited edition (75, I&rsquo;ve got #1 hanging in my dining room) linoblock print entitled &ldquo;Light Lunch,&rdquo; and sent me an artist proof that I took over to the company.</p>
<p>They did a high-end scan of the print and reversed the colours (in the print, that big expanse of open shirt above the glass is actually ink), and my Illustrator file of the type, and within a week, I had a monster box of these.  Extra charge for XL and XXL, of course, but still pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of the short-sleeved version &ndash; you can see the type on the sleeve&hellip;.
<img src="/images/old-images/IMG_0005_2_5247.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as spiff, but that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chard&rdquo;.  ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is great that you started this thread. I too have been seriously considering getting some of my own shirt design made recently.</p>
<p>A friend of mine runs a screen printing shop up in the San Francisco area. He is currently putting some information together for me on blank shirts. I&rsquo;ll gladly share the information he passes on.</p>
<p>For now here is my take on American Apparel:</p>
<p>American Apparel seem to have replaced Hane&rsquo;s Beefy T&rsquo;s as the blank t-shirt of choice for many bands and hip t-shirt designers over the past few years.</p>
<p>Personally I have to give them really mixed reviews. They are probably the most comfortable t-shirts I have ever worn. Initially AA shirts fit nicely and are really soft. However after just a few washes they tend to shrink up pretty severely. Also, that nice, thin material does not seem to hold up as long as other t-shirts I have.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could work out some sort of t-shirt trade once some of us have them made&hellip;?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Pinot Noir&rdquo; shirts are Beefy T&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;Chard&rdquo; are Gildan.  The Gildans were fractionally cheaper and came in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; colour, but I certainly prefer the Beefy T.</p>
<p>Your experience mirrors mine with the AA shirt: the shrinkage was particularly noticeable with mine on the shoulder seam, where the inside tape shrank massively and the shirt itself didn&rsquo;t.  Not a pretty sight.</p>

<p>Maybe we use TypeCon in August as the deadline and have a pub night where we swap.  ;-)</p>
<p>If we keep it to 25, it&rsquo;s not excessively expensive to do a run, too difficult to transport whopping boxes, but large enough to be worthwhile for people who end up paying set-up fees.</p>
<p>(Or 26, and we each pick a letter to design/illustrate as a theme&hellip;.)</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Kern idea Linda, I&rsquo;ll look forward to that pub night. What happens in Seattle stays in Seattle - right ;)</p>

<p>Just laser print your your design (on a laser printer). Then, when you&rsquo;re ready to develop the screen, just pour mineral spirits on the paper. The paper will soak it up turning it transluscent. Poor man&rsquo;s film!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cafepress.com? They are cheaper than spreadshirt.com but don&rsquo;t have as many tshirt choices. They still have a lot but you can only put your design in the center, or pocket area, and on the back. I got my shirt I ordered in about a week. To see the detail of the shirt I&rsquo;m talking about go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/buy/donkey+kong/-/pv_design_prod/pg_1/p_storeid.78854535/pNo_78854535/id_14814859/opt_/fpt_/c_360/">http://www.cafepress.com/buy/donkey+kong/-/pv_design_prod/pg_1/p_storeid.78854535/pNo_78854535/id_14814859/opt_/fpt_/c_360/</a></p>
<p>and then look at the BACK of the shirt. I designed an information graphic of the design process a la donkey kong, pretty cool I guess.</p>
<p>How it works is that there is a base price (say 9.99) which you can buy your item and then you jack up the price, the difference is your commission. I&rsquo;m happy so far, I just wish they more of a variety of colors.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is the information and pricing from my friend that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One color shirts usually will be right around $4 or 4.25 with a screen charge of $25 the first time you order a design. But, AA shirts cost between $6-8 for us to buy at wholesale rates, depending on the cut. That makes them a lot more expensive and we print those for starting around$7. I know that sucks! They just keep raising their prices to printers. They use to be around $4 for us and now it is doubled with their popularity. There are some other ring-spun shirts (the soft AA type) that are not made in USA and they are much cheaper. Those would cost about $5-5.50 per printed shirt + screen charge and shipping.&rdquo;</p>
