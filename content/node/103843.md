  body: "The base font is a Didot variation with the leg well up the arm. The closest
    I found with a quick check was <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stawix/seravee/\">Seravee</a>.
    The designer has replaced the head serif with a loop. Perhaps someone knows of
    a font that does this. I don't. To create the k and similar letters you could
    start with Saravee, or a closer Didot variation, and make loops.\r\nDon"

    because I'm not a graphic designer and don't know really know how to change it
    myself.\r\nBut still, thank you very much for such a quick response!"

  body: thank you! you're right, it must have been designed by/ for her. i found it
    on a site with business card designs without any link, so i assumed it's a font.
    thank you both!

  body: If you only need that one letter... I could convert it to a vector for you,
    but it may well be somebody's actual design (well, it's always someone's design),
    but 'standalone' design rather than a font.

  body: "According to a source seemingly close to (or is) the actual designer....\r\n\r\n\"The
    K is a custom drawn character. The supporting face is Archer.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: really?? this would be great.. well, it's hard to say, it might be since i
    found it on a business card as a standalone letter on blank and defiantone linked
    it with someone's website. anyway, i need it for school purposes, not commerce.
    could only find k fonts with loops rightwards, and i'm after one which would go
    to the outside just like this one
