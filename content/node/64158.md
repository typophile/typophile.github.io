  Typophile and the other being font design. I've found reading the forums and articles
  to be very intelligent and constructive, so I'm hoping the response to my plea won't
  be an exception.\r\n\r\nI've been working on this font for sometime, albeit on and
  off. Each time I return to the design I find a different flaw or a cause to amend
  it, so I thought it wise to put it out there for some insight in the hope I can
  actually finish it. As it stands there is only the one weight and lowercase and
  caps. You'll immediately notice an inconsistency with the S and the kerning is way
  off.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to create a font which would lend itself to logo
  and headline design. Characterized by contrast between a light, slab-serif and heavy
  serif appearance combined. At this stage I'd like to invite comments/suggestions/an
  open critique, to help me see the wood from the trees.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\nGrez"

  body: "I like it! Just some quick thoughts (and I'm no expert):\r\nI think your
    black dots disturbs the otherwise delicate features of your design a bit too much.
    I think you should try make them a bit lighter - either smaller dots or perhaps
    a hollow shape of some sort. \r\n\r\nYour H, A, and Q are brilliant imo - your
    M and f are quite original. The f is good - the M seems as if it needs some work.
    Your're right - the s seems a bit out of key with the rest I think. It gets too
    flat.\r\n\r\nThe 'leg' of the R seems as if it should go lower and not as flat."

  body: "Interesting. \r\n\r\nThe thing that bothers me though is the black dots of
    the terminals. It is definately a character trait, but I don't think it really
    works as it is actually distracting from reading the word. It looks like a random
    collection of bulletholes shot through your typeface ;) It would be interesting
    to see if you can tone down these dots. \r\n\r\nThis is a very geometrical typeface,
    which is a problem with letters like P, O, a & q. It makes these letters look
    stiff, and the a becomes more like a circle with a stick attached, than a letter.
    To make your typeface a lot more interesting I would try working away from this
    very strict geometry. As is often said about Futura, THE geometric typeface: It's
    not actually based on perfect geometrical circles, and it has a slight contrast,
    which makes it a lot more beautiful and interesting. Study the shapes of Futura
    and it will give you an idea how to improve your typeface.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\ngreetings

  body: "Thanks Jeffrey. I'm more than familiar with Futura, so I'll be sure to look
    into it. Maybe a more suitable template to base it on is what is missing.\r\n\r\nThe
    whole 'bulletholes' dilemma seems to be rearing it's head a lot more than I anticipated,
    as to begin with this was admittedly my intended signature feature for this font!
    So you're right - this needs a rethink.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "Actually, I like it <em>because</em> its \"random bulletholes\"! :-)\r\nThat
    said, I find it lacks a bit of coherence in the shape of letters and in the placement
    of the dots. And, most importantly, the only way to see if the \"holes\" are a
    valid feature or just distracting would be to set some actual text with it."
