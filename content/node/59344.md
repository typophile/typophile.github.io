  Aloha]] and I need a couple of complementary fonts for sub-headings and text.\r\nAny
  suggestions?"

    why not go with two of his other creations?\r\n\r\nCocktail Shaker is a fun retro
    script that could work for subheads and Backtalk Sans might work for your text."

  body: I love that combo . . . but Cocktail Shaker is too expensive for me since
    this is just a one time project.  It is the perfect font to go with Hawaiian and
    Backtalk.  Do you have an alternative to suggest?

    Fonts is a script at reasonable price (about eight bucks). Not quite as retro-cool
    as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/cocktail-shaker/|Cocktail Shaker]],
    though. '

  body: Cheers to you! Glad to hear that you went with your first choice. Have a great
    time on the beach. Maybe someone will shake up a cocktail for you there.
