  body: "hey Yves,\r\n\r\nare you refering the British connection because of the UK
    on the image? I found out this type on my recent visit to greece and the quality
    of the type used on the Bank of Cyprus signs blew me away. So it's not a British
    but worldwide thing.\r\n\r\nVery nice type, maybe custom, yes."
