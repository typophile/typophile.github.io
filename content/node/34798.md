body: "Ok, hey everyone! My first post.\r\n\r\nIm really looking for help, ideas and
  suggestions. \r\nI've got to write an essay thats 5,000 words long for my last year
  at University. \r\nI have chosen typography because I god tarn' love it. THE PROBLEM
  IS,\r\nI can't settle on an argument or a compare contrast theme. I was supposed
  to come up with a title and a subtitle, but cant settle on one thats worthy of 5,000
  words. (Plus I did rubbish on my essay this year)\r\n\r\nSO HERE IT IS\r\n\r\nI
  need a title and sub title and an area of typography to base it on. Im begining
  to think maybe I should have chosen something else. Perhaps you guys can proove
  me wrong?\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks for reading my post, and I look foward to any ray
  of light anyone can offer. Thanks."

    make on typographic subjects over 5,000 words. Several months ago, a member posted
    a link to their 162 <em>PAGE </em>study of a single typeface.\r\nIf you love typography,
    what would<em> you </em>like to write about?"

  body: "Thanks Chuck.\r\nI dont know wether I could be so brave enough to write about
    a single typeface, as the intricicies history wise tend to bore me at times. I
    can't think what I would like to write about, Im drawn to Herb Lubalin. I like
    ideas and designing with typography. I love the animated title sequences of Saul
    Bass, the wit of Paul Rand, Tschiholds layouts... Marinettis designs, Avante Garde
    movements. Yet I dont know what to argue about?  "

  body: "Ok, I've thought about it. The main title idea is great, the sub title would
    perhaps need an argument? The title opens up thoughts like how important is typography,
    why is that, will it continue to be, how is this achieved,... how do the eyes
    listen.\r\nSo then I would need to talk about how indvidual typographers / designers
    make type speak?"

  body: "Robert's idea is a great one.\r\nI also think <em>your </em> idea is pretty
    good too. You mentioned Bass (particularly his titling). You could easily write
    about how Bass -- through typography -- set the stage, even the mood -- for so
    many classic motion pictures so that viewers are sucked in, set up and surprised
    before the film even \"gets started,\" in their minds (we type geeks realize,
    of course, that the power of typography can do all that and more, often on a subconscious
    level, while most people think they're waiting for the action)."

    He had a great love for typography, incidentially he liked Folio better than the
    first versions of Helvetica.
