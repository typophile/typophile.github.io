  copied it over, and I can't find any documentation (I guess I never used it). anyway,
  it's used on the cover of the Bas Jan Ader book and dvd (seen here: [[http://www.basjanader.com/img/blog_cover.jpg]])
  and throughout the website [[http://www.basjanader.com|BasJanAder.com]]\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have a guess?"

  body: ahh, yes. I have that Font Bureau version of Hermes, and I think somewhere
    in the back of my head, I had an inkling that was what it was called, but confused
    beyond rational thought. thanks a lot!
