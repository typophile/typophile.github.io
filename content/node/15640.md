  the image shows. Extra points if anyone knows the \"del\" part too. \r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "I doubt if the font comes that way. Most likely I think that was an outline
    version made (for example) in Illustrator by swapping the Fill and Stroke colors.
    You're probably looking for a heavy weight Bodoni, as the basic font.\r\n\r\n-
