  all about making type.\r\n\r\nThe one problem is that in my country (portugal) there
  aren't any graduation courses or masters on type.\r\nKeeping in mind that my main
  languages are portuguese and english (i also speek a litle of spanish), were do
  you advise me to go in order to learn how to make type (country/university/course)?"

    GO TO TYPECON. I cannot even begin to describe how much one learns from sitting
    around in a room full of type junkies listening to type designers talking about
    designing type.\r\n\r\nEdit: Someone just handed me a poster from Basel, they\u2019re
    doing a type design workshop from July 7-11. Baselschoolofdesign.ch"

  body: ">July 7-11. Baselschoolofdesign.ch\r\n\r\nI've always been intrigued by Basel,
    but really, you are going to need a few semesters or a few years to learn how
    to do type, not a few days.\r\n\r\nTravel to TypeCon is expensive from Europe,
    even given the weak dollar. Europe has a lot of great conferences, too, like TYPO
    Berlin and most of the annual ATypI conferences. But actually, given a lot of
    the travel and accommodation costs, TypeCon may not end up being more expensive\u2026\r\n\r\nRegarding
    language, both the University of Reading (UK) and the Dutch Royal Academy of the
    Arts in the Hague teach their Masters courses in English."

  body: "You are right, Dan, a workshop isn\u2019t much in the greater journey toward
    being a type designer. But little workshops here and there are great steps along
    the way\u2014especially if one wants to make connections, learn about the community,
    and build a portfolio for getting into grad school."

  body: True that! But one does not need a portfolio of typeface designs to get into
    a graduate program for typeface design. I think how applicants have used text
    in documents previously is more important than whether or not they have designed
    any type yet.

  body: TypeCon being in Buffalo this year means less expensive for those "across
    the pond". Given how strong your Euro is right now I'd say TypeCon would be less
    expensive than going to TypoBerlin, no?
