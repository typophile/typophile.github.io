body: This is another experiment I&#39;m conducting with &#34;gray&#34; pixel font
  possibilities. The main objective here is to pull off the curves. <BR> <BR>The letterforms
  are curious-looking to me. I like them, but they fall into an awkwardness that I&#39;m
  not sure how to interpret. <BR> <BR>The main thing here is to use the grays in ways
  other than simply filing out the empty pixels in one-pixel wide fonts. That looks
  good, of course, but is that all the gray pixel font has to offer? <BR> <BR>Seems
  like a point of beginning to me. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25936.gif"

    it isn&#39;t. I personally wouldn&#39;t bother with retrofitting a 1-bit &#40;b&amp;w&#41;
    font with the circumstancial light gray around the corners. At the very least
    one should also use another gray to soften the black. <BR> <BR>The good news with
    fonts that have stems of 2 pixels or more is that you have a lot of room for fidelity
    without getting too blurry. I have to say this effort here is too tentative. Here&#39;s
    an &#34;a&#34; for you: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25940.gif"

    gray. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Yes Hrant, Mana is beautiful. Regular does show it grays proudly. But I really
    like the Bold. The font as a set is probably the most completely developed pixel
    font I&#39;ve seen. Ultra Fonts is fortunate to have it. <BR> <BR>I see your point
    with the sample a. I definately agree I could put more work into smoothing out
    the letterforms for Dope, but what do you think of the curvature? <BR> <BR>What
    I mean to say is, the pixels &#40;even with the grays&#41; limit the curvature
    posibilities.  The reason I&#39;ve resisted trying to smooth things out so far,
    is to keep the playful oblong quality of the curves. <BR> <BR>I suppose it can
    be done though, I just haven&#39;t pushed it forward enough yet. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the feedback! <BR>

  body: 'Glad you like Mana. In terms of &#34;completeness&#34; though, Unibody is
    much better&#42;, and it&#39;s free. On the other hand, there will be a Mana-13
    soon, with three weights&#42;&#42;. In fact Mana-13 might have two variants of
    the 2-pixel &#40;middle&#41; weight, one for emphasis in a body of Regular, another
    for body. I might make a Light Mana-16 too. <BR> <BR>&#42; Just don&#39;t try
    to mark emphasis with its &#34;italic&#34;... In fact the only way to decently
    mark emphasis with Unibody is to use the Black in a body of Bold. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    One thing that&#39;ll be cool is that you&#39;ll be able to set nice smallcaps
    by using a weight of Mana-16 with a one-notch-darker weight of Mana-13. <BR> <BR>One
    funny thing about Mana-16&#39;s Bold is its unusual crispness. It resulted from
    having counters that were 2 pixels wide, and I couldn&#39;t use two adacent light
    grays to model the inside - too fuzzy. So the Bold actually follows a somewhat
    different &#34;philosophy&#34;. One thing this does is give the Bold an &#34;exagerated&#34;
    feel compared to the Roman, sort of like in Galliard&#39;s darker weights. This
    helps the less-than-50%-darker Bold stand out just the right amount from the Regular
    - alleviating the need for an Italic, btw. <BR> <BR>&#62; the pixels &#40;even
    with the grays&#41; limit the curvature posibilities. <BR> <BR>Yes, that&#39;s
    a very interesting truth. You could say that the less grays you use the more the
    pixel grid makes itself felt. If you use no grays for example things like to look
    very square &#40;to avoid looking ragged&#41;. With more grays you can &#34;bend&#34;
    the grid to get higher-fidelity curves &#40;plus better spacing and better bouma
    formation&#41;. But like you say there&#39;s a limit, not least due to the necessity
    for crispness: you can&#39;t just have a long, continuous stream of grays to model
    very subtle features, because that would create too much fuzz. You&#39;ll notice
    that my &#34;a&#34; is squarer than your original, and that&#39;s exactly because
    I couldn&#39;t make it rounder without adding too much fuzz. And in Mana for example
    you can still &#34;feel&#34; the grid - some people say it looks like a Windows
    system font. Some of the decisions I made in it have a surprisingly tight relationship
    with the grid/grayscale balance in fact. Like in an earlier version I&#39;d tried
    to stick to 2 grays &#40;to limit the bit depth to 2&#41;, and that actually caused
    the &#34;optimal&#34; form of the diagonals &#40;&#34;v&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, etc.&#41;
    to be bowed! <i>But</i> this required two adjacent light grays at the outer edges,
    creating too much fuzz. When I decided to go for a wider spectrum of grays, I
    managed to get rid of the fuzz, but <i>only</i> by dumping the bowing! Hard to
    believe, but I simply couldn&#39;t have both crispness and bowing in there...
    Spacing plays into all this too - it&#39;s really a precarious balancing act.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>What&#39;s really fascinating about grayscale bitmapfont
    design is that it has its own &#34;zen&#34;, beyond its parallels to both 1-bit
    and outline font design. I think it&#39;s because grayscaling relies on illusion
    to some extent: sometimes the most unexpected arrangement of certain grays will
    make a glyph click. Maybe in this way it compares with lo-fi outline fonts, like
    for phone directories. <BR> <BR>Your idea of using grays very selectively, and
    leaving in some aliasing on purpose is pretty interesting - I hadn&#39;t thought
    of it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    last. At the very least, it carries the spirit of the rest of the set with more
    aplomb. The g now carries the same family resemblance as well. The set as a whole

  body: '&#62; With attention spans that short, the spirit <BR>&#62; of typography
    is more important than the <BR>&#62; minute details of typography, no? <BR> <BR>Well,
    there are two problems with this: <BR>1&#41; I think the spirit comes in part
    from the details! <BR>2&#41; Sites with a lot of text will hopefully keep their
    readers much longer, to actually read the text! <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a difference
    between display and text typography, even onscreen. <BR> <BR>And I actually think
    that the key to good onscreen type is put any &#34;emulation&#34; of an outline
    font on a second level. The &#34;allusion&#34; you speak of certainly matters
    less to the layman than to us font freaks! <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I think this new
    evolution of Dope is on the money. Just the &#34;j&#34; needs a more docile tail.

  body: Here&#39;s where I start running into trouble. The uppers are difficult to
    shape into a cohesive set, let alone one that is cohesive with the lowers. The
    two look to be different weights to me as well. <BR> <BR>I know that uppers frequently
    have a slightly different feel to them than their lowers, but this doesn&#39;t
    feel right to me yet and I&#39;m unsure which direction to try next. <BR> <BR><img
