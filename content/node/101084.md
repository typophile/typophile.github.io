  what this super-compressed sans is? Similar to Gill Display Compressed or as if
  someone had squeezed Futura Condensed...!\r\nthanks as ever for your expertise and
  help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM"

    can see that if it is Gill, it has been heavily compressed further, and even then
    it isn't exactly the same as Gill. So perhaps edited/squashed Gill rather than
    another font?"
