body: Have anyone actually considered drawing optical sizes for web use on a strict
  pixel grid? I'm not talking about pixel fonts, rather just making sure all vertical
  and horizontal metrics plus stem weights fit full pixels at a specific size?

    top rows look a bit forced: heavy weights do not fit in their spaces."

  body: "Poor? There are no deltas. This was to prove the qualities of a \"hinted
    MM-GX-Superpolator font\". After viewers became aware of the clarity in early
    proofs, they would soon start to complain the originals were too light, or too
    dark. So all of the possible weights of each size, more or less are cut on the
    same widths. Thus, yes... the lighter ones are airy, and the darker ones are pushing
    their widths. But the general idea is that either you, your topic or your rendering
    environment have to be pretty extreme to want the extreme weights in these designs
    for text or other small sizes.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

    you used Superpolator to interpolate something close to fitting a specific pixel
    size and then tweaked each font?"
