body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>I am looking for a &#40;good&#41; stone engraving training
  course in Europe. I am looking for one that would take place in UK, Holland or France.
  And that would go for approximately 2 weeks &#40;or less&#41;. <BR>Anybody knows
  some adresses where I could look at ? <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR> <BR>d.

  body: Docunagi, the only course with which I&#39;m familiar is that held as part
    of the Type Design MA at the University of Reading in England. Even then it is
    only a week long part of the process. I hope others respond. This is interesting.

  body: I&#39;d say that Michael Harvey might be your best bet. Our class were the
    guinea-pigs for stone carving at Reading - I recall the print crew assembling
    the easels for the class. Also did a short course in San Jose - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=887"

    which was fun.  <BR> <BR>Might want to drop him a line to see if he offers similar
    courses. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>For info, <BR>I know that Franck Jalleau used
    to do such class in the south of France. But as he teached me type design for
    two years I really want to have a different type of view. <BR>I will look further
    at the Reading class. <BR> <BR>Anybody knows if some course like this exists at
    the den Hague royal academy ???
