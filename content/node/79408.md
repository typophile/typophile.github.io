body: "So not too long ago (past few weeks) I answered yet another font/typeface query
  from a friend.  He said he wanted something that will do justice to his brand in
  one letter or less.  I made a rough monochromatic rendering of the glyph by hand,
  on a 20x30 canvas, using spraypaint and stenciling, took it to their studio, and
  it was enough to convince them.  Score!\r\n\r\nCan you name the typeface I suggested
  to them?  It's at the bottom of the page, far left. http://www.whoisntjohngalt.com\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    That is a custom made monogram from the letter G and J (John Galt). \r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for a typeface with a similar looking G try <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1G3\">Democratica</a>. "

    with \"So\" come from? For a while I used to think some previous sentences had
    been accidentally deleted. Is it for dramatic effect, as if we're all sitting
    round a dining table and there's been an awkward lull in the conversation? \"So,
    anyone for more rice pudding?\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can guess the missing first
    paragraph."

  body: "Well, the EULA governs the usage of the font file (and you're right, riccard0,
    some foundries make particular provisions for such use and some don't), but someone
    who, say, traces a letter from an online source may never see the EULA. And in
    such a case the \"ethical issues\" are indeed of interest!\r\n\r\n(Let me underscore
    that this tracing scenario is a hypothetical for argument's sake, not an accusatory
    guess at what happened in the case that occasioned the original post...)"
