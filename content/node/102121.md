body: "I am setting the text for an anthology on Pre-existence. The text has quotes
  in Greek, Hebrew, transcribed Hebrew and old German (the later uses a double hyphen
  with a slight upward curve [\u2E17]). As an alternative to Times New Roman, I am
  using Adobe Garamond Pro in InDesign. I soon found out that I had to upgrade to
  Garamond Premium Pro in order to get support for Greek. For Hebrew, I am using Adobe
  Hebrew. I am surprised by facing problems I've never had using Times New Roman:
  some glyphs are missing in Garamond, for instance two transcribed Hebrew Letters
  (\u1E24 and \u1E63) and the double hyphen used in old German (\u2E17). I am considering
  replacing single letters set in Garamond to Times New Roman just to make the text
  readable, but I am generally surprised by the fact that it is so troublesome to
  find a worthy replacement of Times New Roman. Does anyone have any suggestions to
  typefaces that can match Times New Roman in its a broad support of languages and
  glyphs? \r\n\r\n"

  body: Also, what do you mean by "upgrading" to "Garamond Premium Pro"? If you're
    talking about Garamond Premier Pro, that is an entirely different font from Adobe
    Garamond, though they were both designed by Robert Slimbach and released by Adobe.

  body: "Since I don't <em>use</em> fonts much there could very well be a perfect
    free solution (such as Brill - although, as David hints it actually has some usage
    restrictions you need to mind) that I'm not aware of, so please take this with
    a grain of salt: one solution is to pay somebody to make any and all modifications
    you need; you're actually lucky that Adobe allows this sort of thing (while most
    font houses these days don't). On the other hand it might be possible to patch
    base letters and stand-alone accents into a working system, but you might actually
    end up paying more for that to be set up for you, since it's not as practical
    as something that works out of the box. BTW, I know I'll sound like a broken record,
    but: I was actually once commissioned to add 20 dotted letters to Garamond Premier
    Pro (for transcribing Sanskrit) so please feel free to ask for a quote*. That
    said, there are many people reading this who could also do this sort of work for
    you, quite possibly better and/or cheaper.\r\n\r\n* hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nConcerning
    your issues with non-Latin text: you <em>might</em> get away with using different
    fonts, but there's a good reason some type designers make matching Latin/Greek/etc.
    fonts... A nice level of harmony isn't so easy to achieve (especially when it
    comes to matching color - AKA weight), and you might spend a lot of time tweaking
    disparate fonts into a working whole. When one writing system looks \"more important\"
    on a page, <em>somebody</em> will accuse you of cultural favoritism!  :-/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    AFAIK the \"wide-coverage\" version of Gentium doesn't have a Bold, in case that
    matters.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, try to avoid mixing fonts inline (I mean in a
    single writing system) since that's very unlikely to result in something to be
    proud of...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@ bbg: Thanks for the advice. Brill certainly has a wide coverage. It has
    Greek and all the glyphs I was looking for. When I compared it to Garamond Premium
    Pro, however, I still preferring the latter. Comparing it to Times New Roman,
    without necessarily wanting to defend this particular font family, TNR still covers
    Hebrew. But again, Brill could still work and then perhaps with Adobe Hebrew.
    \         \r\n\r\n@ Joshua Langman: I referred to Garamond Premium as an upgraded
    version of Adobe Garamond Pro because I find they look alike, but only Premium
    font covers Greek - actually, I thought all \"pro\" versions would cover Greek.

  body: "Well Charles, this time there's no <em>direct</em> personal attack, but you
    <em>are</em> accusing me of lying in order to get business. I'm not like that.
    We are simply disagreeing on certain things, and I believe that what I do can
    be valuable to some people sometimes. I make/modify fonts not because I can't
    make money any other way (in fact I do) and I have to trick people to pay me,
    but because I enjoy providing that service that some people sometimes need. I
    don't know when a particular person needs it, so when it seems to make sense I
    offer it and see if it clicks. If it does, both parties benefit. If not, oh well.\r\n\r\nBut
    I actually don't think you care about how I make money or not; I think the real
    reason you're upset is that I expose your shallow understanding on some topics.
    I guess it's not enough that I agree with you sometimes, I must not disagree with
    you ever on anything.\r\n\r\nStart your own blog. This is a <em>forum.</em>\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPeople
    got around before the invention of the wheel too. Unlike you I have made multi-script
    systems, and people have paid good money for them (and paid me to consult on refining
    such systems). I don't make them as a snake-oil ruse or because I'm bored - I
    make them because I think they're needed. And I'm not the only one by any means.
    Claiming that formal harmonization of scripts (as opposed to hoping for some dumb
    luck with whatever fonts are on hand) is not a design parameter is nothing short
    of deluded.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I actually have no fonts that meet Christian's
    multi-script criteria, and I couldn't promptly make any. So how could I sell him
    anything? I was simply giving free advice there. The only service I can/did offer
    related to adding missing characters to Adobe Garamond Premier. And how could
    that be a deception? Do you really think cobbling things together is a better
    solution? Well, I guess you could... But I simply don't agree with that (even
    though I did mention that approach).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW, I have again saved
    Charles's formerly helpful post. I don't feel totally OK reposting it, but since
    I consider a post to Typophile as being partly \"owned\" by Typophile, if anybody
    needs a copy please let me know.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    since the 16th century. How did they ever manage?</cite>\r\n\r\nExcuse me. The
    fact that the original post did not explicitly mention that the poster was trying
    to typeset his book using OpenType or TrueType fonts on a computer, instead of
    with hot metal does not mean the original poster was being mendacious.\r\n\r\nYour
    other complaint, that he was seeking advice of a nature that amounted to asking
    people to do work for him for free, may or may not have been valid, but the claim
    about using half-truths is simply <em>absurd</em> if that is intended as its basis,
    as it appears to be.\r\n\r\nMost of the free fonts I know of with lots of support
    for foreign languages are versions of Times Roman, and I don't know of a Garamond
    with such coverage. There's a font with a lot of characters <em>called</em> Caslon,
    but it's actually in the style of the ugly Roman lettering used with some old
    Chinese fonts. If one is using Windows, it now comes with Sylfaen, which has wide
    language support without being Times Roman.\r\n\r\nFor Greek, specifically, the
    Greek Font Society has numerous free Greek fonts with a matching Latin part. There
    are free Hebrew fonts with a Helvetica-like Roman, and no doubt others as well.
    But if you insist on setting your Roman, Hebrew, and Greek in a single font, I'd
    suspect that Times Roman, Arial and Sylfaen are almost your only free choices.
    Oops; Sylfaen doesn't have Hebrew.\r\n\r\nAh; there is another choice. TexGyre
    Pagella has both Greek and Hebrew. It looks like Palatino by Hermann Zapf.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, you probably don't need to choose a free alternative, as you're using
    Adobe InDesign, not Scribus.\r\n\r\nAs for old German, you perhaps should look
    at Dieter Steffmann's selection of Fraktur fonts, although I don't know if they
    have the hyphen you want.\r\n\r\nOh, wait: there's EB Garamond from Google Fonts."

    International]] does not offers a font including Latin, Greek and Hebrew scripts.\r\n\r\nIn
    Mac OS X, Arial, Courier New, Lucida, Tahoma and Times NR supports these three
    scripts.\r\n\r\nI plan to add Hebrew in a future version of my font project, but
    this would come just in late 2015."

  body: I've just verified that the specific missing glyphs cited seem to be present
    in EB Garamond - and TexGyre Pagella. However, I'm wondering if some kind of font
    aliasing may be going on when I look at the character map - a number of fonts
    even have CJK characters that I would not have expected to do so. Maybe the open-source
    fonts are just copying each other or using a big full-Unicode font as a starting
    point.
