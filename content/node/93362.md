body: "Good day, everyone.\r\n\r\nI've always been quite impressed by Scala Serif.
  It's dead-easy to make a paragraph hang together nicely with this typeface. Even
  colour, not too dark and not too light. Extremely readable. \r\n\r\nXavier Dupr\xE9's
  FF Yoga Serif seems to be Fontshop's \"successor\" type system to Scala. This is
  not to suggest that Yoga is somehow a replacement for Scala, but my takeaway from
  the marketing is the impression that Yoga is the \"Scala for our time.\" \r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm also noticing is how similar the two fonts are. There *are* some differences,
  certainly. However I find that I could substitute Yoga for Scala, at least at sizes
  between 9-12 point, and still conform to my original reasons for using Scala. \r\n\r\nBy
  \"similarity\" I'm not implying that Yoga is a slightly modified facsimile of Scala,
  but rather, that both Majoor and Dupr\xE9 seemed to have pulled ideas from the same
  sources, and to remarkable effect. \r\n\r\nI invite your comments. \r\n"

  body: "I suppose shooting the breeze discussing conceptual approaches to typeface
    design may have some benefit as a pleasant diversion, but rather little practical
    consequence. On the other hand, perhaps being impractical is what makes some experiences
    pleasant, since they serve no purpose other than amusement, which is an excellent\u2014if
    useless\u2014exercise in itself.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a simple appreciation
    <em><strong>that</strong></em> something works is often preferable to knowing
    <em><strong>why</strong></em> something works. The article Hrant cited provides
    a lot of rationalizations, intended primarily to convince us to buying the font
    makes sense\u2014and who doesn\u2019t want to think of themselves as eminently
    practical and world-wise?\r\n\r\nBottom line: Yoga shows a strong Eric Gill influence,
    and the typefaces are similar in that the designers appear to have habitual ways
    of rendering certain characters. In other words, siblings sometimes look alike,
    no matter who\u2019s their daddy."

  body: "<cite>Scala is very light</cite>\r\n\r\nMartin Majoor drew Scala when the
    typesetting-printing workflow was repro-negative-plate. If you look at a book
    printed using that workflow (circa 1995) and compare it to a later book printed
    using a direct to plate workflow, you see that the DTP printed type has lost about
    2/1000 of weight. \r\n\r\nSo, embolding using 1 unit in FontLab (2 in Fontographer)
    restores what Majoor \"saw\" when he cut the font. Worth doing. I think the man
    is a genius. For me, the fonts are not dated, it is simply that the printing workflow
    changed. Personal taste, I suppose, but I much prefer Scala to Yoga\r\n\r\nOf
    course, without permission from FontFont, such embolding is not allowed under
    the license. Luckily for me, due to a sort of historical accident, I have permission.
    There is another way in an applications program like InDesign that lets you get
    at the stroke weight of characters. I've not tried increasing the stroke in InDesign
    for Scala but if you can get a value that works, it would of course be legal.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a shame the publisher didn't re-issue the fonts when the technology changed
    -- or issue a new book weight..."

  body: "charles and rs:\r\n\r\nI find Scala's colour to be very even (that is, not
    too dark), and I think this is something of an advantage. I understand that there
    is (or was) a problem with spindly, anemic type. A lot of designers addressed
    this problem quite well, notably from Underware and OurType. \r\n\r\nThe problem
    with all this rich, dark type, is that it can look somewhat jarring on paper.
    The type can appear too strong, at least in true 1200x1200 dpi, for example. I
    find that Scala (and Yoga as well) are a little more sedate on the page without
    losing their meatiness. Now Luc Devroye of Textism has opined that digital Dante
    has survived the translation to digital from metal. If this is true, then by comparison
    Scala is not only designed *for* the digital age, but is a fine example of the
    characteristics of form that this kind of type is expected to exhibit in this
    context. Dante is noticeably lighter than Scala at true 1200 dpi.\r\n\r\nNow I
    understand that a lot of this is a matter of opinion and personal taste, and that
    these judgments also depend on the medium being used, but a complaint I have with
    some of that highly-regarded conspicuously dark type in the market (to be used
    for long tracts of text) is that they tend to scream at the reader. Some of them
    are just too dark. "

  body: Skipping over personal taste,  and before saying anything further, I get suspicious
    when you say "1200 dpi." Are you talking about an offset press (usually the plate
    is imaged at 2400 dpi) using wet ink? Or are you talking about fused toner particles?

  body: "Mr. Szabo:\r\n\r\nI took what I though enough pains to indicate I was talking
    about printing with an offset press. To say the typeface is too dark, based on
    an *unmentioned* viewing of toner-based printing, is more than a bit misleading.\r\n\r\nI'd
    note that as of 2012, when more than 500 copies of a book are to be printed, using
    an offset press is still the cheaper method. That's a fact.\r\n\r\nNot fact but
    personal opinion, whenever I see anything printed with xerography, high praise
    from me would be \"not bad, considering.\" In other words, I've never seen type
    well represented by toner.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you need to investigate is <cite>
    resolution</cite> The 1200 dpi resolution you tout is likely the capability of
    the laser to image the belt. It is an advertising number, that is, it's true,
    but not terrible meaningful in terms of a final printed piece of work. \r\n\r\nSystem
    (total) resolution is what counts to to a viewer/user. Mathematically, System
    resolution is 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R 3  + ... + 1/Rn = 1/Rt. For your own understanding,
    plug in some numbers and see how quickly total resolution drops when just one
    or two items have low resolution -- such as the paper that takes the ink.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as 1200 dip lasers go, when I initially fit the letters of a typeface, including
    kerning, I use both the screen and a laser printout. But I am aware that when
    I have a couple books printed, I'll have to go back and make adjustments, because
    (1200 dpi) laser output does not give an accurate enough  rendering. This for
    text use, by the way.\r\n\r\nSo if laser (toner) output is your thing, have at
    it. But please make sure that point is clear in your posts, there are some of
    us who discount laser printouts entirely.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned
    that the weight of a font as seen on laser output is quite different than from
    offset printing. So too the contrast (fine versus thin strokes). As has already
    been pointed out, so too is the color ... "

    makes all the difference to me. So what we're talking about is really the limitation

    But please make sure that point is clear in your posts, there are some of us who

    In retrospect I'm surprised I didn't mention it. It seems the obvious thing to
    have done, on my part. In any case, having thought about your remarks, I should
    only render judgments within the parameters of the medium being discussed - in
    this case, laser/toner - and even then, my judgments should be tempered by the
    actual reality of using that medium, since laser/toner might not be the best way
    to do justice to a typeface. \r\n\r\nThank you again. \r\n\r\nChristian"
