  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve made two attempts in the past to gain a degree in typo/graphic design at LCC but only managed two weeks first time round and then two of the three years the second time of trying. I have a hot/cold relationship with type in terms of personal endeavours but consistent admiration for the discipline.</p>
<p>So hats of to those of you who are seasoned veterans, and looking at the forums there are many. Mainly i am asking for a little insite into individual and personal working strategies, motivational aids or any little things that go on inside your head which help keep things consistent.</p>
<p>The creative mind I find works when it wants to, often flashes of inspiration keep me occupied into the small hours when there is little to act as a distraction. When this subsides, I reach the end of a specific idea or things don&rsquo;t work out, finding the track again is a difficulty. There is no formula of course and i know to a large extent dedication is inherant but any elaboration would be interesting.</p>

<p>:) the biggest thing I&rsquo;ve ever found to keep things on track, moving, and to completion is a client with a clear idea of what the font is for. Second best, if you don&rsquo;t have a client, is that You have a clear idea of what the font is for. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My biggest problem is thinking of a new design possibility for a face before the one I am working on is finished. This year alone, I am working on 8 different faces in various stages of completion.  It isn&rsquo;t that I am stuck and don&rsquo;t know what to do. I just can&rsquo;t stop myself from starting a new project when the new idea strikes.  I find I just have to get at least some basic characters down in the new font or I just can&rsquo;t sleep. I have one face that could be done in 2 days but have been putting it off to work on the italic for a face I did 4 months ago.</p>

<p>Not sure I&rsquo;ll ever know why I do anything, aside from scratching itches as such but they all seem so big and itchy but only need the smallest of scratches. The example above I can relate to because the &lsquo;why?&rsquo; is the outcome and that purely beyond reasoning with words.</p>

The link was included to illustrate something for which I have an affinity but as yet no abbility to execute.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minusspace.com/fried/fried.html">www.minusspace.com/fried/fried.html</a></p>
<p>Much of the work is very good, Hartmut Böhm specifically, whom karl gerstner showed fairly early support for; <a href="http://www.minusspace.com/index.html#artists">www.minusspace.com/index.html#artists</a></p>
<p>So yes, it is this stoic drive I search for. Before the summer is out I aim to have finished one of the many projects that currently lay dormant and will be sure on completion to post an image or two for which credit/ shame can rightfully fall to me.</p>
