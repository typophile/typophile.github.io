body: "This is my first attempt at a serif text typeface. This is by no means anything
  super original (in fact, it seems to have some similarities with Alex Heilmair's
  lovely Paulista Serif a few posts below). I just wanted to try doing something that
  actually looked like it might be able to hang out at a fancy party with Garamond
  and Charter and not run home crying because it's not classy enough. \r\n\r\nAfter
  looking at it closely, I see several problems, and I'm hoping you can point out
  anything else that looks weird or inconsistent (either within the typeface or with
  common practice).\r\n\r\n\u2022 The curves in the \"S's\" seem a  bit heavy\r\n\u2022
  The \"B\" and the \"R\" need some refinement in the curves\r\n\u2022 the lowercase
  \"a\" looks a little weird. This was my first attempt at a two story \"a\" and something
  just doesn't seem right, but I'm not sure what.\r\n\u2022\_this was also my first
  attempt a lowercase \"g\" and it looks pretty good, except I'm thinking that maybe
  the stroke in the bottom half is a little thick\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan\r\n\r\n"

  body: Just a quick thought... try decreasing the width of the space glyph. The text
    will set better with less space between each word!

  body: "This is working well. Suggestions:\r\n\r\nI'd raise your t's crossbar. \r\nMaybe
    widen the h (and perhaps u/n)? \r\nLooks like X wound up a touch short. \r\nThe
    g is attractive but might be a little too bouncy in character for this crisp font.\r\nThe
    S looks almost monoline - I would make its thins thinner. R gets too thick in
    the middle, too. \r\nr seems a little heavy, and s seems a little light.\r\nThe
    top terminal of c and r need some work.\r\nConsider losing, or changing, the bottom
    serif of the b.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

  body: "I feel like doing a long post. ;)\r\n\r\n<em>Lowercase:</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>a:</strong>
    Left side of top terminal has a strange bulge on it. Could use smoothening. I
    also don't like the bowl. Consider making the top part of the bowl more like how
    the bowl on the b joins the stem (i.e. bending slightly downwards and slimming
    down). The a is currently the only character that has such a bowl. Also the only
    top terminal that is diagonal.\r\n<strong>b:</strong> I would lose the bottom
    serif on the b aswell.\r\n<strong>c:</strong> The top terminal of the c is also
    bothering me a bit. Consider changing it so that it doesnt bend down as much as
    it does now (so make the top more like the bottom, but with a serif). Terminal
    serif maybe a bit short?\r\n<strong>d:</strong> The bottom join of the bowl to
    the stem needs some more space, exactly like you did on the u.\r\n<strong>e:</strong>
    It looks like the e is slightly rolling to the left. It probably only needs a
    tiny bit of tweaking here and there to counter this. I'm also not sure about the
    vertical cut-off on the bottom terminal, although it doesn't really break style
    or anything like that.\r\n<strong>f:</strong> Try to bring the crossbar to the
    x-height. I understand why you placed it lower (I've done it too), but I don't
    think it's necessary in this case. Could it also have a similar top terminal as
    a and c?\r\n<strong>g:</strong> Interesting shape, I do like it, but it needs
    some polishing. Eliason is probably right; it might be a bit too interesting for
    this typeface.\r\n<strong>h:</strong> Might be slightly too narrow.\r\n<strong>i:</strong>
    See 'u'\r\n<strong>j:</strong> See 'u'\r\n<strong>k:</strong> Top stroke is too
    heavy. Bottom one should be heavier than top one. I also think the k is too wide.
    \r\n<strong>m:</strong> Might be slightly too narrow.\r\n<strong>n:</strong> Might
    be slightly too narrow.\r\n<strong>p:</strong> Bottom serif on the side of the
    bowl could be longer (to the right) This makes the letter stand stronger on it's
    'feet' (your r has exactly what I mean).\r\n<strong>q:</strong> Use it as reference
    for the b.\r\n<strong>r:</strong> The ear is way too long. It needs to be at least
    50% shorter.\r\n<strong>s:</strong> The spine (the middle, diagonal part) needs
    to be heavier. It has to have the same optical (not mathematical) weight as your
    heaviest available stroke.\r\n<strong>t:</strong> Crossbar, see f. Also the vertical
    cut-off again on lower right, looks kind of harsh.\r\n<strong>u:</strong> The
    pointed tops of the u extend above the x-hight (overshoot). Yet, you don't do
    this on the i, j, m, n, p and r. Probably better to make that consistently the
    same. It can probably use some overshoot, judge by eye.\r\n<strong>v:</strong>
    I can't really decide, but it looks like it might be slightly too wide. Also a
    bit of balance, i.e. it leans to the right. \r\n<strong>w:</strong> Can't judge
    it well, can't seem to find any in the lipsum texts. Middle apex might be leaning
    to the right.\r\n<strong>x:</strong> Looks pretty good, although the lines crossing
    each other needs to be optically corrected. See [[http://typophile.com/node/51421|this
    thead]] for what I mean.\r\n<strong>y:</strong> Also pretty good, although the
    tail is quite fragile.\r\n<strong>z:</strong> Is a bit heavy, because of the horizontals.\r\n\r\n<em>Uppercase:</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>A:</strong>
    The left stroke is heavier on the top than on the bottom (it flares). Also the
    crossbar may be a bit too high. It does not need to be the same as the e etc.,
    make it optically right. I feel it should be a bit lower. Look at weight of crossbar.**\r\n<strong>C:</strong>
    Compared to the O and Q, the D might be narrow.*\r\n<strong>D:</strong> Compared
    to the O and Q, the D might be narrow.*\r\n<strong>E:</strong> Look at weight
    of crossbar.**\r\n<strong>F:</strong> Look at weight of crossbar.**\r\n<strong>G:</strong>
    Compared to the O and Q, the D might be narrow.*\r\n<strong>H:</strong> Can't
    judge it in context, but it looks a bit narrow. Look at weight of crossbar.**\r\n<strong>K:</strong>
    Same critiques as with the lowercase k. Top arm a bit too heavy. Character width
    needs looking at.\r\n<strong>P:</strong> Maybe it looks better if the bottom part
    of the stroke - where it joins the stem - slightly thins down. Also the heavy
    part of the bowl seems to be on the bottom right, while for the rest the weight
    is mostly vertical.\r\n<strong>R:</strong> I would probably attach the leg/tail
    directly to the 5-o-clock position on the bowl, instead of making it come from
    the stem (so bascially an edited P with a leg/tail).\r\n<strong>S:</strong> Too
    much weight on te shoulders (the two parts that look like hooks :p ), the weight
    should be on the spine. See lowercase s comments.\r\n<strong>V:</strong> See lowercase
    v comments.\r\n<strong>W:</strong> Much too narrow. Proportion the V and W to
    each other like you did with the lowercase.\r\n<strong>X:</strong> See lowercase
    x comments.\r\n<strong>Z:</strong> See lowercase z comments. Look at horizontals.**\r\n\r\n*
    If you want classic proportions.\r\n** Should probably be optically the same weight.\r\n "
