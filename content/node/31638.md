  to time if i'm not too stressed, but I'd like to make a leap from mouse to some
  kind of stylus tablet. \r\n\r\nWhat is your experience and recommendations?\r\n\r\nYours</strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: I love my mouse... it's not necessarily about a mouse per se but a holistic
    combo of what sort of mouse it is, how you use it, click speeds, movement speeds
    across the screen, how high you are relative to your desk, how straight/bent your
    arm is, how far you are form your screen etc. I'm left-handed but still use right
    handed button settings - works for me. Sorry, not very helpful.

  body: "First off you may have a serious medical condition that may need to be checked
    by physician- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Tendonitis, or something worse.\r\n\r\nI
    would suggest to relax your grip on what ever tool you are using- mouse or otherwise.
    Soft click as opposed to hard ones. Make hard fists every so often. Wiggle your
    fingers and take stretch breaks too.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury\r\n\r\nAlso
    you may consider consulting with an expert in office ergonomics... its a tax write
    off for sure and these people can help you situate your office in way that will
    be more productive and healthy for you..\r\n\r\nI live with chronic pain too (
    not from computers ) so I can relate to how you feel. I hope you find a way to
    ease your symptoms.\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "<strong>Our office masseuse will be here this friday, she knows a lot about
    ergonomics. Last time she recommended me some kind of wacom tablet, but for the
    specifics I rely on You. I don't want to get Tendonitis!</strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: I have a little optical track ball. I've been on the ball for a very long
    time and find it better all around. I do use the software to tune it, so slight
    motions are slowed down even more and quick motions cover lots of area.
