body: "One Example is the RE/MAX logo.\r\nI've seen it in a Type book before, and
  I think it was Avant Garde, but I have Avant Garde and the M's, A's, and V's are
  not slanted like the M is seen in the RE/MAX logo. I've seen this font many other
  places, but the RE/MAX logo is the easiest example I could find. My friend thinks
  it's just a modified typeface, but I know it's not.\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.weaverboryk.com/images/REMAX.jpg"
