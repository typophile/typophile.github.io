  apartment, and i'll be having a blast decorating it. I LOVE LETTERS and fonts. does
  anyone have any ideas about how to decorate with letters? i know it sounds silly,
  but i would love to have letters (beautiful ones, of course) on the walls or on
  the shelves or all over the place? hmmm.... the possibilities are endless. "

  body: When I was in college I went through a phase like that as well. I was obsessed
    with hand cut lettering used on store fronts and once off signage jobs for building
    sites. So under the cover of darkness I would visit such places where typographic
    niceties were to be found and i would, ahem, 'borrow them'. Over the years I built
    up a pretty impressive collection and had the whole house decorated. It became
    a kind of phenomenon here in Ireland - every student seemed to be doing it (borrowing
    them I mean - I'm sure they did not have the same appreciation for letters as
    I did)  and it even made the news on TV and National press etc. It was a slow
    news week. But I've grown up now and no longer condone such activity :(

  body: I googled using terms such as "wall hanging letters," "furniture letters,"
    "decorating letters," "decorative letters," "wood letters," "plastic letters,"
    "neon letters," "stuffed letters," and "plush letters" and got a lot of potentially
    useful results. Also, most hardware stores (e.g., Ace, OSH, Home Depot, Lowes)
    carry wood, metal, or decal letters meant to be used for house addresses that
    you could adapt to other uses. Unicahome.com has some glow-in-the-dark letters
    and numbers that look like building blocks.

  body: Make your own typographic compositions, and go somewhere where you can let
    those be cut out on a large plotter. So that you end up having large stickers
    of letters, that you can stick on your wall. Like they sometimes do in museums
    and such. If you know what I mean.

    a friend's bathroom based on the same principle. Tiles with letters in different
    colours can be procured cheaply. I then found a text I wrote on her walls with
    the tiles. No space, no punctuation (hard to find): I used different colours for
    different words.\r\n\r\nhttp://perso.orange.fr/reseau.nord-sud/Concorde-it.htm\r\n\r\nIf
    what you want is to choose yor own type though, you can make images in Photoshop
    or else, of the letters/words you want, and get them printed and framed professionnally."
