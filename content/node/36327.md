  write-up and photos</a> of my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/35362\">Hamburgefonstiv</a>
  and Dezcom typography T-shirts on his <a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=188#comment-48847\">TypeOff</a>
  site in Germany. You all know him from his posts and admin duties here on Typophile
  or from his work with LinoType and his typefaces [<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/typeoff/1146233663/\">Morris
  Sans is featured on the current LinoType T</a> from TypeCon Seattle]. \r\nYou may
  not know of his esteemed ancestors, though! How many of us have <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/typeoff/695373500/in/photostream/\">our
  ancestor's portraits by Hans Holbein on museum walls</a>! \r\n\r\nDan will shortly
  be off to Reading to study for his masters degree in type design so look out for
  more outstanding typefaces from him. In the mean time, he will be having some \"fries
  with that\" :-)\r\n\r\nThanks Dan!\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/danman2_4760.jpg]"

  body: "Ah, the esteemed Dezcom\u2013TypeOff cross-marketing scheme returns!\r\n\r\nRegarding
    <a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=124\">the portrait</a>, I should point out
    for the record that:\r\n\r\na. I know of no relationship to the very late Georg
    Gisze\r\n\r\nb. I also know of no German ancestry in my family (this would probably
    rule out any connection with Herr Gisze\u2026)\r\n\r\nAlso, while in Reading,
    I suspect that french fries (err\u2026 chips?) are about the only sort of food
    I'll be able to afford, with the current dollar to pound exchange rate in effect\u2026
    so this t-shirt is extraordinarilly appropriate ;-)"

    I see you in Brighton - it was really your Thessaloniki talk that gave me the
    idea for the shirt. Will an XL be okay?  '

  body: Si, if XL is the last remaining shirt, then of course it will be ok! It may
    be a few years before I properly fit into it, though.
