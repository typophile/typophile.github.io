  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">this great type is called "Hadassah", designed in israel by Henry Friedlander.
when i turned one of the letters on it's side, i noticed it's interesting "okatsim"* that are similar or were inspired by latin serifs.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6223.jpg]

* "oketz" is the hebrew term for something like serifs, only in the upper end of the letter, as seen in this picture:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-11_3591.jpg]


my question is something like this:
what kind of fonts(english i mean) have these kind of serifs?

		<div class="commentbody">What you circled resembles a slab serif with some bracketing, such as you find on faces like Clarendon, though the serifs are normally parallel or perpendicular to the baseline, not angled or curved like your example. 
I hope this is a useful reply.

		<div class="commentbody">kudos for the slab serif, but i think that the original typeface is much more rigid (when looking at the bigger picture.
i agree with you about the parallel thing. 

btw, the original "serif" (we shall call it like that) has a slightly cut end.

		<div class="commentbody">I read somewhere that Friedlaender was consciously trying to get the feeling of Jenson in his type, so it's not surprising that there's some echo in the shapes, and the modulation of line. So the answer to your question I think is: Jenson. 

The story of Hadassah, which is as you say one of the great Hebrew types, is incredibly moving. He was a student of the great Rudolph Koch in Germany, but moved to Holland when the Nazis took over in Germany. He started work on what would become Hadassah in Holland. When the Nazis took over, he buried his drawings, but continued to work on it in hiding for nearly three years in an attic, while fed and protected by his non-Jewish wife. He survived and after the war he dug up the drawings, emigrated to Israel and completed it there. 
Influential type teacher Gerrit Noordzij says he was responsible for making what became KABK "letter friendly" and so to hire Noordzij.

[[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1991/LB-N91-Fontaine.html|Here's an extensive description of the development of Hadassah]], with a nice bibliography at the end. You should be able to get a hold of his book in Hebrew in Israel, where he also taught.  

One of the heroes of type, in my book. 

ps, I edited this to add the link, so it got out of order. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the issue is inspiration rather than imitation. Also remember that the original Jenson--and I'm sure Friedlaender saw photos, and maybe originals--is not the same as Slimbach's Adobe Jenson, as beautiful as that is.  </div>
