body: Over the years I have used both Suitcase and ATM. It seems many of my fonts
  that used to work now come up corrupt. They work if I activate them in spite of
  the font utility warning. Some fonts don't work anymore at all. I don't believe
  anything happened to the fonts at all. I think the font management software has
  become more fussy about certain font issues over the years. For instance, I have
  a collection of old fonts called OPTIfonts all of those report as damaged but they
  work. I am confused about why good fonts go bad or report they are bad. Also I have
  tried font doctor and that doesn't seem that great. Maybe I don't use the right
  settings. Are there other ways to fix fonts?

  body: "Welcome to living with the consequenses of the rip-roaring, fast flyin' type
    explosion of the nineties!\r\n\r\nYou see, when digitla type was young, there
    were only major companies releasing \"professional\" type-1 PostScript fonts,
    under license from Adobe, and the format was protected and inaccessible (for the
    most part)... so it still took a lot of time and effort to produce faces, and
    quality control was a decent part of that. True, there were \"type-3\" PostScript
    fonts, fully editable/accessible, but they were few and faw between (or complete
    cr*p). \r\n\r\nThen came Fontographer... it only worked with type-3 fonts, but
    grew to enable Truetype and Type-1 as those formats opened up. Fontographer was
    cheap, (relatively) easy, and opened up a world of fonts... it seemed that fonts
    were popping up everywhere! Add to that the consolidation/expansion of all the
    \"traditional\" libraries as typesetting became exclusively PC territory (when's
    the lst time anyone spec-ed a galley of type around hre?), and Voil\xE1! A world
    of digital type accessible to all!\r\n\r\nBut the dark sde of the tale is that
    many, many fonts (and not just the cheapies) had subtle but real encoding errors.
    The PostScript Type-1 format has a lot of error-checking built in, but wasn't
    perfect; now Opentype is here, and there's tons of places things can go wrong.
    The latest utilities do a much better job of identifying problems with fonts,
    but they do tend to \"go overboard\" at times -- better to flag a questionable
    font than to let it wreak havoc.\r\n\r\nRemember too that fonts are (IMHO) the
    number ONE culprit in \"mystery\" system crashes. It's not that a font doesn't
    \"work\"... it's got to play nice with all the other fonts (conflicts) and the
    sytem itself. There's got to be something there when the system asks for a particular
    glyph.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's not just the cheapo fonts at fault here. Adobe would
    never admit that some of their early faces had issues, but they used the OpenType
    conversion as an opportunity to address a lot of those. Ever look at the outlines
    from the \"original\" Type-1 Helvetica? EEK!\r\n\r\nYour best bet is to A) try
    re-installing fonts from your original source discs (fonts CAN become damaged
    over time and use); B) update to the latest version of FontDoctor (or other checker
    utility); C) run all your fonts through the utility again (make sure they're not
    installed at the time); D) try reinstalling and running them.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    still getting errors, it's time to loook for a replacement. Contact the manufacturer
    (with a receipt) if you can, they should be able to send you a replacement or
    update. Or upgrade to the newest version. I'm slowly replacing my workhorse families
    with the latest OpenType releases, and it's d*mn pricey, but I figure I gotta
    do it 'til I bite the bullet and pop for the full Library release (the latest
    Adobe Font Folio - 11 - is \"only\" 3 grand, if I see it go on sale I might just
    have to go for it).\r\n\r\nAs much as you may not want to hear it, some fonts
    really should be \"put to sleep\"... they're old, worn out, or cr*p to begin with.
    It hurts to throw them away, but you gotta do it sometimes. Think about it...
    you wouldn't try to install or run MacDraw 1.0 on a dual-core intel MacPro, but
    you expect the fonts you used back then to still run perfectly. "

  body: Wow, thanks for the info. Wouldn't that be a dream... a full library of new
    fonts! Better than diamond earrings! I have to admit I make do with a hodge podge
    of fonts collected over the years. It's a very sad state of affairs. It's like
    I'm still wearing 80s cloths!
