body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nWe are happy to release our latest typeface, we hope
  you like it.\r\nBaton is a sans serif typeface with narrow proportions combining
  eccentric shapes inspired by french vernacular typography with the simplicity of
  modern sans serifs. Peculiar details and a low contrast make the design slightly
  strange yet elegant, but it is the exaggerated high and low midline in the uppercase
  and the small x-height which give Baton its distinctive flair. Relatively wider
  and more toned down, the lowercase allow Baton to function not only as a display
  typeface, but also for short texts such as leads in magazine.\r\nBaton comes in
  10 styles with an extended language support and a wide range of OpenType features
  such as ligatures, alternate letters, tabular and lowercase figures, fractions,
  and a stylistic set of uppercase with thin accents for headlines with tight leading.\r\nDesigned
  by Yassin Baggar and Anton Koovit. Originally commissioned by Yorgo Tloupas and
  Paul Chemetoff for the redesign of GQ France magazine.\r\n\r\nBaton is available
  exclusively at www.fatype.com\r\nYou can get the free trial fonts from our homepage
  (Try button) and test the typeface directly in your design.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_1.jpg\"
