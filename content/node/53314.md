  them into a series. The theme is celebrating the human spirit. I would also like
  to ask that should I get this project rolling, will I get in trouble for using the
  original images I based my work on? Thanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://dencii.deviantart.com/art/John-Lennon-in-Type-88812976\r\nhttp://dencii.deviantart.com/art/Martin-Luther-King-Jr-in-Type-108805541"

    into each other.

  body: Very nice! It's so hard to say if you might get in trouble. You might want
    to consider taking a photo of someone in shadow yourself then no worries...it
    isn't like the photo would have to be excellent to achieve this effect.
