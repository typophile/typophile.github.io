body: "I'm working on a manual using Neo Sans for the headers, call-outs etc... and
  need something to pair with it for body copy. I can't purchase any new faces so
  preferably I need something from the adobe library. \r\n\r\nCurrently I'm using
  serifa but I don't think it works with lots of copy.\r\n\r\nThe manual is for the
  healthcare industry and has an \"elegant science\" sort of feel. (think macro shots
  of viruses against black backgrounds)\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, Thanks"

    has a very classical or American feel which may not be appropriate for Neo. Contrast
    can be good, though. \r\n\r\nAhh, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/pmn_caecilia_std_complete_vp/\">PMN
    Caecilia</a> could be considered a great text-optimized alternative to Serifa."

    weight(s) do you want use for your headlines?\r\n"

    to say that)\r\n\r\nI wish I had charter, the closest I have is joanna, but it
    doesn't seem as modern. I tried using Utopia and it was o.k. but didn't fit as
    well as I would like.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure on which weights I only have the bold
    and regular so I've got a 50/50 chance of using one of those"
