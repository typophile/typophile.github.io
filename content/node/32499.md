body: "I ran across this clever tool for generating dummy text:\r\n< a href=\"http://macupdate.com/info.php/id/24454/Corporate%20Ipsum\">Corporate
  Ipsum</a>\r\nIt is a Mac Dashboard Widget, requiring Mac OS X 10.4.3 or later.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a little hard to describe what is special about what it does, so here is a sample
  of the generated text:\r\n\r\n<cite>Authoritatively unleash proactive best practices
  with installed base relationships. Rapidiously leverage existing process-centric
  methods of empowerment and client-based information. Appropriately transition parallel
  solutions for synergistic supply chains. </cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Interactively transform
  premium methodologies before sticky potentialities. Uniquely integrate e-business
  alignments and cross-media meta-services. Compellingly reconceptualize global information
  vis-a-vis user friendly meta-services.</cite>"
