  body: Its interesting that the people at Photoshop User magazine think its okay
    to stretch, squoosh, and do anything to type for their images (hey its only type)
    and they are so lazy to make learn into leam on the cover feature article of their
    July/August issue. So sad, maybe someone could get hired by those folks to take
    care of the typesetting and maybe teach them about how to use type.

  body: 'As the use of tightly set headlines becomes more familiar, there will be
    a wider appreciation that a font''s built-in kerning is usually optimized for
    a relatively open setting, and that manual kerning is required for tight heads. '
