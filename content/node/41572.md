  to come up with any conclusive answers. I'm in my last year of my Graphic Design
  course at Staffordshire University. I've been studying the originality of Garamond
  to produce a set of designs which highlight how Garamonds originality has been lost
  throughout it's many versions. \r\n\r\nBasically without me going into great depth
  and detail. I was wondering if anybody knew which are the most prominent versions
  of Garamond and the characteristics which define them from the original 16th century
  cut, for example x-height. I'm going to end my design with ITC Garamond as I believe
  this is the furthest deviation from the original.\r\n\r\nThe other problem I'm having
  is obtaining the original version of Garamond. I've studied the Egenolff-Berner
  foundry specimen of Garamond from 1592. But ideally I would need a digitised version
  of the original. Does such a thing exist? Has anybody made an accurate digital version
  of the original? \r\n\r\nI'm sorry to ask so many questions, any help would be greatly
  appreciated."

    can't help you with most of your questions, what I know is the common stuff of
    Granjon, Jannon, etc. But that last question is an interesting one -- what is
    the original? Is it the punches? The specimen? You've probably read Smeijers <cite>Counerpunch</cite>.
    Did whoever made the punches test them by lightly inking them & pressing them
    into paper? What was he looking at as he adjusted the punches -- or did he bother?\r\n\r\nInk
    & paper & printing were different then, too, so whatever was looked at was based
    on that technology. If you are just after a pure mechanical size, I suppose the
    punches themselves would give the dimensions of \"the type.\" There would always
    be small variations in the printed type. But those dimensions aren't particularly
    interesting, either, nor would they show variations with current digital Garamonds,
    where (we hope) the digital punchcutter also look at the results of a printed
    specimen -- & then decide whether to go with a version that worked best with (1)
    a laser printer, or (2) high resolution offset, the latter coming form either
    (1) repro-negative-plate, or (2) direct-to-plate.\r\n\r\nYou get different answers
    depending on how you first answer these questions.      "

    some of the more prominent Garamonds and their characteristics.\r\n\r\nHowever
    I'm most interested in 1592 Garamond, if it as you say a direct tracing from the
    forms of the \"original\", or the Berner. I have tried searching for this version
    but I'm unable to find any reference to it, or any foundry that I can purchase
    from. Without being to much of a pain could somebody point me in the right direction?

  body: "What is a \"direct tracing\"? Because that can mean about a billion things,
    none of them necessarily making it more accurate than another. In fact, without
    the original drawings or matrices, any \"Garamond\" is going to be subject to
    the type designer's whims and interpretations of the printed type specimens. \r\n\r\nThat
    being said, Slimbach's Garamond Premier Pro is considered to be the *most accurate*
    rendition by most Typophilers, and will probably be as close to \"original\" as
    anyone can get short of resurrecting Garamond himself."

    Yes, I meant Ross Mill's 1530 Garamond. (I'll go bang my head against the wall
    by way of apology.)\r\n\r\nIf you look at p. 74 of Bringhurst you can see what
    Ross Mills has taken his digitalization from \u2014 and his letterforms are very
    accurate renditions of these shapes. I do agree with DanGayle that despite this
    the 1530 Garamond of Mills does not look, on the page, that much like a page of
    Garamond. The forms are too anaemic."
