  ]</em>\r\n\r\nDoes anyone here have experience working as a designer in Japan, on
  Japanese-language material? I'm wondering idly about a couple of things:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.
  What are some of the staple fonts in Japan?</strong> In countries that use writing
  based on the Roman alphabet, a list of staple fonts might include the likes of Helvetica,
  Univers, Franklin Gothic, Futura, Garamond, and Bodoni. (Not an authoritative list,
  I am not a lawyer, etc.) These fonts are resilient and have been in heavy use for
  a while. What are some of Japan's?\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Are there any Japanese fonts
  in heavy use that pro designers consider embarrassing?</strong> Are there analogs
  to our Arial, Comic Sans, Curlz MT, and Papyrus?\r\n\r\n<strong>3. What are the
  top-level font categories in Japanese type?</strong> In western countries, we've
  got serif and sans-serif, and then subdivisions within those (geometric sans vs.
  humanistic, old-style serif vs. transitional vs. modern, etc). What about in Japan?
  Funnily enough, it looks like you guys have a serif vs. sans distinction too. Fonts
  that imitate brush-stroked kana look like they have little serifs, while other,
  more contemporary fonts don't. Is that right? How do you begin to categorize your
  fonts?\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Do most fonts include tons of kanji, or just the kana?</strong>
  (Man. I would not want to be a Japanese typographer.)\r\n\r\nJust asking out of
  curiosity. I took Japanese for a year in college a long while ago and I've been
  wondering about these things on and off since I became a designer."

    to time, so I'll answer what I can.\r\n\r\n4. Out of necessity, text fonts will
    include fairly comprehensive kanji, whereas this is rarely the case for display
    and decorative fonts, which there are many. They often only have one set of the
    kana or the other (hiragana or katakana), but sometimes there are both in separate
    font files, and also a matching Roman font to go with them.\r\n\r\nJapanese text
    fonts are certainly available, but much less common than those for scripts with
    smaller character sets. If your operating system is capable of displaying Japanese,
    it will usually include a square-stroked font that complements sans-serif roman
    type, and a contrasty stroked font with brush ticks on the strokes that complements
    roman serif fonts. I'll have to dive through my font menu to find the names of
    the ones I have."
