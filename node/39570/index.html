  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m redesigning a daily newspaper that&rsquo;s moving to a tabloid size. It will still be a serious publication, not tabloid in nature. All the daily headlines will be in there, but there will also be a large lifestyle section. At the same time, the editors are keen on a &ldquo;fresher&rdquo; look, especially since the paper is moving to a new format.</p>
<p>This newspaper has been through 2-3 redesigns already in the last 10 years, and has moved from Century to Franklin Gothic for display. I like a classic typeface as much as the next person, but I think we are ready for a more contemporary, more energetic feel. At the same time, the pages have to be reader-friendly and legible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a serif that has a variety of weights, as well as a sans and a slab serif to go with. I absolutely love these serif families with all my heart: Mercury, Farnham, Greta Display, Prensa and Publico. (As you can see, I&rsquo;m big on x-height). For sans, I lust after Amplitude and Leitura Sans. As for the slab, I would get Freight if the budget allowed, but sadly, it does not.</p>
<p>So here are the issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are the &ldquo;spiky&rdquo; faces like Farnham too fancy and distracting for news? They would be perfect for the lifestyle section but I fear they will be too &ldquo;much&rdquo; for news. I have seen Mercury used in a major daily newspaper and got very excited by the letters, but I was looking at it as a designer, not a reader. Should I go back to the drawing board and relook at the classic faces? Or should I seize the opportunity to give the paper a new look? (We will be showing prototypes to focus groups: if they hate it, then well, back to the drawing board)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I doubt that the budget will accomodate most of the fonts I&rsquo;ve mentioned. What similar or comparable typefaces would you recommend that will be less expensive? Are there typefaces that have serif, slab and sans in the same family?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I apologise in advance if these are issues that have been brought up before. Thanks for your time!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, since you mentioned Leitura Sans&hellip; I must say that I&rsquo;m finishing two new workhorse typefaces: Glosa and Prelo.</p>
<p>Glosa is a serif typeface in three styles: Roman with sharp serifs, News with bracketed serifs and Headline, with x-height matching the small caps. Prelo is a sans with the same x-height as Glosa, and 9 weights from Hairline to Black with matching italics.</p>
<p>If you want to, send me an email and I don&rsquo;t mind to send you digital specimens of both typefaces, since the fonts aren&rsquo;t available and will not be available that soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s good to see you thinking deeply about your type choice for the paper. My first piece advice would be to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->print<!-- raw HTML omitted --> every font you&rsquo;re considering, preferably the kind of paper that you&rsquo;ll be using. A 100dpi monitor is no way to test newspaper fonts. Most good foundries have a PDF specimen available, and some suppliers (like FontShop) will supply a PDF with a selection of text formatted to your preference for testing.</p>

<p>What is your budget? When you&rsquo;re talking about type families, the prices don&rsquo;t differ very much.</p>

<p>Dino, it&rsquo;s interesting that some &ldquo;newspaper&rdquo; fonts are bracketed, but others, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swift<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were designed specifically for newsprint are sharp wedges. Can you say more about your decision to title the bracketed serif a &ldquo;News&rdquo; face?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, let&rsquo;s say that when I introduced the Roman version to a designer, he told me he considered it too idiosyncratic.
I guess that a bracketed serif looks smooth on body text than sharped serifs. Although I prefer sharped serif typefaces like Greta, Farnham and of course Swift (my favorite typeface of all time).</div>

<p>writingdesigning - Ha! Yeaah &hellip; those dang readers&hellip; :)</p>
<p>Stephen - I wonder if I&rsquo;m thinking <em>too</em> deeply about the fonts. I&rsquo;ve been looking at proofs of pages set with various fonts, but I haven&rsquo;t tested them on newsprint - thanks for reminding me! As for the budget, well, I can&rsquo;t really say because honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what it is. But because the purchase would be for multiple licenses, the cost of buying 2-3 font families would be quite high. So I&rsquo;m hoping to maybe just ask for one or 2 new fonts, that could match with fonts that we already have (Adobe fonts).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I used Farnham Display for headlines and Mercury Text for body text (with Shaker for captions) when I redesigned my former school&rsquo;s newspaper. When reviewing samples of Mercury and Farnham, I found Mercury smoother to read, although part of this may be colored by Yves' excellent review of the Fleischmann revivals (in the Typographer.org archives). I purposely wanted type that readers would notice; my reasoning was that even if future editors did not design pages very well, the terrific, exciting type would carry the layout.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about Farnham, you should be aware (if you&rsquo;re not already) that Christian Schwartz made a headline version to tone its quirks down a bit (see it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). And if you&rsquo;re concerned about cost, before I bought Shaker I used Myriad Pro as the complement and it worked quite well. I just wanted more style, even in the captions.</p>
<p>EDIT: I&rsquo;ve also been compiling a list of newspaper types, and I think mine is now pretty exhaustive. You actually mentioned most of my absolute favorites, but you may also want to consider Chronicle from Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, Arnhem from OurType, Lexicon from The Enschede Font Foundry, Eudald from Feliciano Type Foundry, Leyden from Psy/Ops, and Houston from Christian Schwartz.</p>

<p>They are a proven, matched serif+sans news type system with text and headline variants. Both are good for tabloid size, as they have a large x-height, quite short descenders, and semi-condensed proportions.</p>

<p>Quincunx - That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ll be telling our Finance department :)</p>
<p>Auricfuzz, NickShinn - Thanks for the suggestions. I did consider Chronicle, but I still prefer Mercury/Farnham/Greta. I noticed that the Farnham Headline is listed under &ldquo;custom&rdquo; type rather than retail, but it says in the description that Farnham Headline is available to publication designers - I&rsquo;ll have to go see what that means. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m growing quite attached to Dino&rsquo;s Glosa. (Except for the yen sign - sorry Dino!)</p>

<p>Friendlyreader, I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to gather information by calling/e-mailing all the foundries whose types you are considering. These discussions, with questions and suggestions will mean you are able to make a decision you will be satisfied is the best one. As the buyer you are in the driver&rsquo;s seat, so make them work for you :)</p>
