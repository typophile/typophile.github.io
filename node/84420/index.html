My first thought was that the tagline might become too small when the logo is reproduced in a small size. 

> as well as the symbol being too small

Yes, I'd try the symbol a little bigger. Right now it feels like the name and symbol are too similar in visual weight; I think it would be better if one of them was more dominant.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">FWIW, don't take it the wrong way, etc -- I think the logo is all over the place. The symbol is precise and geometric, 2nd like is quirky with a lot of character (i.e. the exact opposite of the mark) and 3rd line is more of a refined understatement and fairly far detached from the first two. It looks like a mix of 3 styles that don't mix that well together.</div>

Initially the idea was to use a fairly neutral sans serif with the symbol, but the client really liked the wordmark and it is well suited to her work/influences. I guess I'm looking for ways to bring the three elements together more. Will look at an alternative for 'fine jewellery'

		<div class="commentbody">Have you tried going with a 'fill' rather than 'stroke' look on the mark?  There are some very thin lines throughout and a couple of very awkward tiny dots in the middle of the fish tail that don't work even at this size.  How about engraved on a ring?  Maybe even beef up the subtitle a bit?

I would make the mark as wide as you have the subtitle here, yea, huge.

Or what about incorporating the monogram ES?

Sans for the Fine Jewellery is certainly a step forward IMO.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@apankrat - aren't you the one who suggested using it as a vignette? 

I guess it comes down to your vision of hierarchy.  Do you want the symbol or the name to be dominant?  What do you want people to look at first?  I agree with apankrat that in the last version the name is dominant, and the symbol is downplayed.  But that may be exactly what you want.  To make the symbol dominant, you are going to have to beef it up more and make it a lot larger and refine the details.  I think one reason the stroke wasn't working for me is that it looked like you clicked stroke and left it at that.  The double line idea could work, but it would need a lot of finesse in the details, and probably reworking some of problems with congestion in the center.  That would move it away from a stroke look to something more intentional and designed.  

There is something smart about how the name is the only part with that weight and the rest is matched thin lines.  It does create a clear hierarchy.  The last version is growing on me.  Good job.</div>

I think the lastest version does help with the hierarchy and balance, and the lines help tie the elements togehter, rather than having them sit there independently.

		<div class="commentbody">No rules above and below the logo. Getting too "design trickery"

The strongest part of this logo is the distinctive deco lettering for the name. As others have noted, the rest of the elements do not reflect this same design era. I think you can get away with it in the tagline (tho consider adjusting the E crossbars and the size of the R bowl, join of the N etc for a more arts and crafts feel).

On the symbol, consider a redraw finding your inspiration from arts and crafts sources. Eg Batch Elder tiles, Mackintosh, Green and Green etc. I can see it going more Japanese in influence or possible more organic William Morris. The direction should reflect the jewelry. It could even be that the fish/mark are a supporting brand theme vs part of the logo. Eg...  A fish print varnished on the package. A koi papercut etc

Also not sure about the E and inverted E together. I'd just go with one.

If I had to choose from above I go with the "Better Balance?" one.

Nice job!</div>

Just thought I'd post back with the final outcome. The client decided the icthus / celtic thing was too much of an issue, so we developed the symbol slightly. Business cards will be gold foiled on purple stock. 

Thanks again for all the suggestions - very helpful.
