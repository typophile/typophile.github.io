  body: My copy of Casablanca Antique - a Corel font which was bundled with CorelDraw
    - appears to be a perfect match. However, a Search on MyFonts for 'Caslon Antique'
    yields <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=caslon+antique"
    target="_blank">several similar fonts</a>.
