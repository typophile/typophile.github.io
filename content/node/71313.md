  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/eikilogo_6321.jpg]\r\n\r\nI think the Eumig
  logo is from around the 50s and the EIKI from around the 70s but I'm not 100%.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest I've got to the EIKI logo font is Superclarendon http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/superclarendon/
  which seems very to me but I don't think it's quite right.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any
  ideas?"
