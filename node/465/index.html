<div class=commentbody>Oh, now I get it. <br>I think it's very simple. Uppercase need to be slightly heavier than lowercase. Otherwise, since Uc letters have more white space around them, they (Uc) would look lighter than lc. <br>But it should be just a slight extra weight. No more than 110%, I think. Of course, this percentage depends on the typeface too, some typeface may need more Uc extra weight. <br>A priori, there's no negative consequences. It's just a necessary optical adjustment.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Respectable"? Awww, shucks. <br> <br>Look how small my cap height is compared to the lc x-height. The question is, do the caps look too light in actual text? I actually remember somebody complaining about that to me, but being one of the very few people who's seen Patria at 2400 dpi, I'm not sure they need to be heavier... And note that my caps are very tightly spaced. Looser spacing requires darker forms. <br> <br>So they might indeed be too light, but maybe the more important thing I'd note is that your ideal weight increase depends on relative proportions, and spacing. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think you'll find something about it on web. I think I read something on this subject right here, in these forums, but I'm not sure... <br> <br>I think the variation in your numbers is mostly due to each typeface needing a particular adjustment. The important is that, in the end, you should achieve a good (even) text color.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi BJ, <br> <br>Thanks for starting up this thread. I haven't come to a difinative answer on this yet. I scaled back the caps in my Friday Fonts thread. They went from 112% to 106%. What i wanted was for them to optically look the same. As I got darker in weight, the difference went up slightly. I think the Black weight is 109%. The light weight I recently posted will be around 105%. <br> <br>Here's what I did with my lunchhour: <br>Adobe Garamond <br>Bembo <br>Bauer Bodoni <br>ITC Officina Serif <br>Neue Helvetica <br>Futura <br>Univers <br> <br>(Rounded to the nearest integer) <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12350.gif alt="cap weight comparison"> <br> <br>Perhaps we will see a trend that serifs have a larger difference? Bembo need to go on a diet! Actually heavy caps has always been a beef for me about Bembo. <br> <br>As far as the Ed Benguiat LC o = UC stem, here are the grades for the roman weights: <br> <br>AGaramond: cap too narrow <br>Bembo: cap too wide <br>BBadoni: cap too wide <br>Officina Serif: exact <br> <br>NHelv: cap slightly wide <br>Futura: cap slightly wide <br>Univers: exact <br> <br>So much for my theory about bolder weights having more % difference between cap and lc! <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>Randy - very interesting!...Maybe an authority will come in <br>and explain whether there is a method to the madness or <br>whether it's all in the optical correction.

<div class=commentbody>My "master" weight (from which the light and dark extremes were made) had lc stems of 90 ems. I made the caps 95, but when I made linos realized it was a bit much. I try to avoid 1-em mods, so I went down 2 ems, and it looked fine. 93/90 = 1.0333... <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>BJ, <br> <br>Have you made any headway on your 20-25 fonts? I'd like to see a broader sampling, and more contemporary designs (last 10years) to see how they stack up. <br> <br>I've decided my personal preference is between 103 - 110%. Anything more seems dark to me. Although I must admit my test is flawed. I'm comparing horizontal width of the stem of the h with the stem of the H. This doesn't neccesarily fully take into account the font's modulation. For example, Adobe Garamond. The roman weight is 111%, but text settings don't look dark. I think this is because on the "width of lc 'o' = UC stem" test the caps looked narrow. This tells me the over all color is even, dispite the "heavy" % <br> <br>Hope that makes some sense? <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>*thinking out loud* <br> <br>Couldn't it be that instead of an exact percentage, it is somewhat similar to "what came first the chicken or the egg".

<div class=commentbody>bj -- <br> <br>As you've said, there isn't a fixed percentage. It's an <br>*optical* compensation, so you have to *look* and see <br>what it needs. Some designs might need more, some <br>might not. It may also depend a little upon cultural trends, <br>and also perhaps printing technology (see below). <br> <br>If you had asked me I probably would have told you <br>that I made the Whitman capital stem 110% of the <br>lowercase. But I see now that I didn't. Go figure. <br> <br>In writing about the cutting of Linotype Monticello <br>(a revival of Binny & Ronaldson's Pica Roman No. 1, <br><i>aka</i> Oxford) C.H. Griffith wrote that he was surprised <br>at how heavy the capitals appeared in contemporary <br>proofs made with type freshly cast from the original <br>matrices, compared to specimens from the original era. <br>The theory he developed was that 19th century printing <br>technique tended to build up more color on the lowercase <br>than the capitals and the typefounder then added more <br>weight to the capitals to compensate and get them to <br>print more in harmony with the lowercase. But 20th <br>century technique did not have the same effect and so <br>the extra weight in the capitals was more pronounced <br>in his contemporary proofs. The result is that he slimmed <br>down the weight in the capitals in order to get an <br>equivalent harmony in Linotype Monticello. <br> <br>I seem to remember Matthew saying that when he did <br>his recent digital revival of Monticello, he chose to slim <br>the weight of the capitals even further, relative to the <br>lowercase, because the capitals of 19th-century style <br>types (even as adjusted by Griffith in the 50s) still <br>tended to look too heavy to the modern eye. <br> <br>I say, Trust your eyes. And if you don't trust your eyes <br>yet, then train them by looking closely at other typefaces <br>and developing your own judgement about which look <br>balanced in the capitals and which do not. <br> <br>-- K. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> C.H. Griffith wrote that he was surprised at how heavy the capitals appeared in contemporary proofs made with type freshly cast from the original matrices, compared to specimens from the original era <br> <br>Is it possible this has to do with gain (which was greater in the past), since a certain [absolute] amount of gain applied to both lc and UC bodies would actually bring them closer in relative weight? (This would also affect stroke contrast, in fact to an even greater extent.) <br> <br>-- <br> <br>BTW, it also happens that caps are sometimes made intentionally much darker than the lc. Usually this happens in very small sizes and/or darker weights, where all-caps setting might benefit from extra punch.

<div class=commentbody>These kind of analyse remember me the Commission Jaugeon who done the most horrible typeface called Romain du Roi, particularly the italic -- corrected visually by the punchcutter, who never tell what he have done to them! Others done similar with geometric analyse of Roman inscriptions with compas and rules, funny! <br> <br>There is no strict rules for such things, my Parisine, a bit like Gill Sans seems to have quite heavy caps, just because I want them like that (for some reasons that I know well), others, such Stone or Minion show pretty light caps, "et alors?"

<div class=commentbody>> Type design is more feeling than maths. <br> <br>Yes, but it's also a set of "procedures" (different for each of us), and I think BJ is after those, not a formula. The numbers are only clues as to what the procedures are, but often they're the only thing we have. <br> <br>> I'm not sure I really followed what you were specifically stating above. <br> <br>What I was saying is that if you add (the equivalent of) X em units of weight (due to gain) to the lc and the (thicker) UC, the two become <i>relatively</i> closer in weight. <br> <br>>> "a tendency to build up color on the lower-case, whereas the capitals with generous counters and side-bearing were not similarly affected" <br> <br>Does this make sense to you? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

And all those little details make them what they <br>are. <br> <br> <br>>[...] I don't think these are rhetorical questions. <br> <br>They're kinda rhetorical, I think.
