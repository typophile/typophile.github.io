    with median spurs and a terminal design on the _G_ which is called snakehead.\r\nI

    of concave with median spurs in the form of Gladiate [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GladiateAsGEORGE_4465.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/gladiate/\r\nSnakehead
    terminal design in Painters Roman,  first produced in the late 1870s by Vanderburgh
    and Wells and by the William Page Wood Type Co., and digitized by Joy Redick as
