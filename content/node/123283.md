  body: "I agree that his started out as Linotext or another revival of Wedding Text,
    designed by Morris Fuller Benton and originally published by ATF in 1901. \r\nThis
    type of edited rip as a font is the kind of thing I thought I might find on Creative
    Market but there was nothing in the most likely categories https://creativemarket.com/tag/blackletter

    \r\nI also did a cursory check of \"free\" fonts and also drew a blank.\r\nSo,
    my guess is that its more likely a logo than a full font.\r\nBut some of the other
    type detectives are persistent and might turn up something.\r\n\r\n\r\n "
