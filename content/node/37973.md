body: "I have been reading the Logo, Font and Lettering Bible and was wondering how
  do font designers make stem widths appear consistent.  For example a vertical stem
  that is 4px wide 20px high may look okay but if you rotate it so that it is horizontal
  the stem appears optically thicker, but in reality it is not.  How do some of you
  correct for this?\r\n"

  body: The simple answer is, make the horizontal version thinner. There's probably
    a formula for this, but I just eyeball it. Typefaces are full of optical corrections
    like this, and a good lettering artist will make them almost unconciously when
    drawing letters manually.

    of your own (bi-focal) vision and how near or far it is to be viewed from and

    same dimensioned stroke at the to of a glyph. Forget the formulas and just draw
    the damn thing.\r\n\r\nIf it looks good it is good. (apologies to Duke Ellington)"

  body: "I think type designers can sometimes exaggerate the amount of difference
    needed to counteract the optical illusion.\r\nThis is because we spend so much
    time looking at perpendicular strokes that are unequal, and imagining them as
    equal, that when we look at perpendicualr strokes that ARE equal, we imagine them
    as being unequal in the opposite manner to our habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It varies with the typeface: Here's how much wider the vertical in the plus
    sign is than the horizontal,in a sample of typefaces: Gill 1.1%, Georgia 1.6 %,
    Californian FB 1.6%, ACaslon 6%, Franklin Gothic Book 8.6%, AGaramond Semi-Bold
    19%.   \r\n\r\nAs you can see there is no hard and fast rule. Because roman faces
    generally have heavy verticals and lighter horizontals, this also affects what
    looks 'right', as well as the optical illusion. And then the style of the typeface
    also affects it. And different glyphs will be different. So as James says it's
    your design and your eye in the end. \r\n\r\nA way to get a feel for it is to
    look at other designs in a font editor, and compare them, as well as drawing your
    own. "
