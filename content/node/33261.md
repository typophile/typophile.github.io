body: I am currently setting some financial data, and I want the dollar sign to stay
  in the same position all the way down a row within a table as it appears in the
  Five-Year Selected Financial Data section of a 10k report. How do I do this in Indesign?

  body: Well, if U+2007 & U+2008 (figure space, & comma/period space) have been correctly
    filled out in your font, you could use them to pad between the numbers & the dollar
    signs, while aligning on the decimal. I'm told this is very old school, & there
    are better ways, I just don't know them. I guess because it is so old-school,
    most fonts don't seem to include them, though. The other way I can think of is
    to use an extra tab stop for the dollar sign.

  body: "Super-special InDesign way: 1) Highlight the column of numbers. 2) Open the
    Tabs palette (Window>Type and Tables>Tabs). 3) Click on the ruler inside the Tabs
    palette to create a tab stop. 4) Click on the 4th of the arrows at the top of
    the Tabs palette (the down arrow with the decimal point next to it). 5) Under
    \"Align on,\" type \"$\" (no quotation marks). 6) Drag the tab stop on the Tabs
    palette to wherever you want to align the numbers.\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful
    to making the numbers tabular figures so that they align as well. That should
    be accessible from the character palette flyout menu: OpenType>Tabular Lining
    or Tabular Oldstyle."

  body: Just checking to make sure I understand. The above works, so that with one
    tab stop, there is alignment of both the dollar sign and the decimal (the one
    indicating going from dollars to cents, or from "one" of whatever basic unit being
    used to a "fraction" of that unit). And it doesn't matter that commas, parenleft
    (sometimes used to indicate a loss) intervene?

  body: 'Not exactly, Charles, assuming that I''m understanding you correctly. The
    tab stop method above can only align to a single character, so <em>either</em>
    the $ or the decimal point (or comma). It will line up all the numbers along the
    chosen "Align to" character; the beauty is that different number of digits from
    number to number doesn''t matter. You could use it for whatever character: a "2"
    or a "d" if you so choose.'

  body: "Hypothetical table:\r\n\r\n$10,000.56\r\n$   956.01\r\n($1,076.52) -- or
    perhaps $(1,076.52)?\r\n\r\nThe exercise is to align on the decimals, while also
    having the \"dollar signs\" align.\r\n\r\nSo I'll stand by my first post -- use
    2 tab stops, or \"pad\" the entry."

  body: 'Last month I made some specialist financial fonts for a client where some
    glyphs were given a space of zero  ( ] for instance ) and the numbers were made
    to have a standard width and some characters were forced to be blanck spaces with
    exactly the number width & a few other things as well. My point being that if
    you are clever you may be able to modify your font ( read you EULA before you
    do! ) and get it do some of the typesetting for you automatically.  '

  body: Ah. Now I understand, Charles. Using two tab stops (one for "$", one for ".")
    doesn't seem to work in ID, so I guess the solution is to do it manually. But
    aligning to both would seem to create some really odd spacing.

    or do a search-and-replace....

  body: FWIW, the usual editorial take is to have a $ for the first item in a column
    but not for other items above the total line, and every time there's a line, you
    need another $.  Cluttering up every line with a $ (unless you've got great swacks
    of leading) probably isn't appropriate....
