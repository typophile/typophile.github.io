body: Hi, <BR>I&#39;ve just downloaded and installed TransType Pro 3.0.1 for Windows
  &#40;trial version&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using the software to fix some naming
  issues in T1 fonts. <BR> <BR>In fact I&#39;m performing a Win T1 --&#62; Win T1
  tranformation, editing family names, font name, etc. <BR> <BR>The problem is that
  the resulting pfm files are &#40;all&#41; 1 KB so I suppose I&#39;m losing kerning
  data in the tranformation... <BR> <BR>Of course trial version has some limitations
  &#40;50% of glyphs are modified and TrT logo is embedded&#41; but this is probably
  a bug. <BR> <BR>What do you think about it?

  body: Alberto,  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t replicate this behavior on the full version
    of TransType Pro 3.0.1 for Windows. The kerning pairs are present in the final
    PFM file.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.

  body: Adam, <BR>the Win T1 --&#62; Win T1 tranformation is ok when the original
    T1 fonts have also inf and afm files. When they have only pfm and pfb files, TransType
    outputs only 1KB pfm files... <BR>Regards <BR>Alberto

  body: 'While we&#39;re on the subject, I&#39;ve had a few problems with font naming
    in TTPro. Conversions from PCT1 to MacT1 of Carter &amp; Cone Galliard came out
    of TTPro weirdly named and apparently in the wrong suitcases &#40;InDesign could
    only find a couple of the fonts -- a couple more it found, but couldn&#39;t find
    outline data for&#41;. <BR> <BR>Screenshot 1: The original PCT1 fonts going into
    TTPro. Everything looks good in the conversion pane, all in the right place and
    properly named etc. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/67633.jpg"
    alt="Screenshot 1"> <BR> <BR>Screenshot 2: This is taking the output MacBinaries
    and plugging them straight into the front end of TTPro again. Everything&#39;s
    a bit of a mess on the left &#40;reflected by the fonts&#39; behaviour on the
    Mac&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/67634.jpg"
    alt="Screenshot 2"> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m guessing this is to do with my lack of knowledge
    of naming schemes etc., but I&#39;d appreciate any help. <BR> <BR>FWIW, to get
    the job done I went back to ol&#39; Crossfont, which handled everything quite
    happily. <BR> <BR>Robert <BR> <BR>&#40;Sorry about the big jpegs&#41;'

  body: Hi, <BR>I&#39;ve just visited the FontLab site and the MSN support forum.
    <BR> <BR>There is no mention to this serious TransType Pro bug &#40;missing kerning&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The trial version is still 3.0.1. <BR> <BR>Did you correct this bug in
    the full version? <BR> <BR>Many thanks <BR> <BR>AR

  body: I thought I would report what I think is a bug I found in TranType that I
    just purchased. I have a windows ttf that works fine in Mac OS X but after converting
    it into a mac ttf with Transtype it installs into the fontbook and then after
    I click another font and come back to it, it becomes greyed out and unselectable
    then it says OFF on it and after awhile dissapears from the menu altogether.
