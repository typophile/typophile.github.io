  to Element, National-Werkschrift, Tannenburg, Potsdam, but none are an exact fit.
  Has me stumped.\r\nAny ideas and/or additional letters that match.\r\nI can't decide
  if this is a font or precise lettering.\r\nThanks"

    decide if Kdf-Wagen is essentially the same or definitely something else.\r\nWould
    love to see a higher definition character set, or even a range of letters.\r\nDon"
