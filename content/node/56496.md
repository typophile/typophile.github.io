body: "In class the other day I was told by a fellow student that she saw a photo
  I took of Rudi in a magazine at the doctors office. Optimistic yet skeptical I asked
  to see the magazine. How many photos of puppy's in the grass are there on the internet?
  A whole lot. So what are the chances of my photo being published? This was my mindset.\r\n
  \r\n\r\nAs I was walking out of the class she came back with magazine in hand. We
  flip to page 72 and there he is (photo below)! My photo got published! This is exciting
  and all, but here are a few things that make this deal not as sweet as it could
  be.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I searched for my name to be credited and it wasn't there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  istockphoto licensing agreement states \"you may not use the Content for editorial
  purposes without including the following credit adjacent to the Content: \u201C\xA9iStockphoto.com/Artist\u2019s
  Member Name]\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI emailed them to ask about this and their response was
  that this article was considered a promotional piece, not an editorial piece. Are
  you serious? They're excluding an article as an editorial work. What sense does
  this make???\r\n \r\n\r\n2. I placed this photo on istockphoto.com and while stock
  photography is great, you never know where or when or in what capacity your work
  will be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Selling on stock photo sites pays pennies.\r\n\r\n \r\nSo
  I do have a question for anyone that stumbles upon this blog. What should this publication
  be considered as? Editorial? Promotional? What should Country Living Magazine's
  responsibility be to this situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CountryLivingSm_5614.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.glennsorrentino.com\r\n@IheartHELVETICA

    on things.

  body: "istockphoto should go to bat for you on this, since they are profiting from
    your work, and they are acting as your representative. Somehow, I doubt they'll
    be any help, however. Their pricing model does not lend itself to pursuing action
    in situations that have generated only a few dollars for the company.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the publication claiming that the article was promotional is complete BS. Another
    corporate entity refusing to take responsibility for its actions. They've made
    a profit off of your artwork, and they can't even give proper credit.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a shame, as it's a nice photo. Keep up the good work. Maybe at some point you
    can hire a rep who will protect you in circumstances like this."
