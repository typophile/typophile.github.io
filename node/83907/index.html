  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I was recently setting a document in Baskerville (whichever foundry Apple uses, presumably), but something kept bugging me. “But you like Baskerville,” I kept saying. It wasn’t until I saw the PDF that I realized what was going on. The version of Baskerville that I’m using is a weird one, almost to the point of being a slab serif.</p>
<p>All this got me to thinking, I need a good roman serif font. In the past, when I had a good copy of Baskerville, I used that, but now I might as well find one that I really like. I have been quite taken by Edward Johnston. In particular, I really like faces that show that they were designed by a calligrapher who was holding a pen.</p>
<p>I know that Johnston worked on Imprint, which has many good qualities, but Johnston’s foundational hand is not one of them. A better way to describe Imprint might be that it was made by a bunch of other designers and also Johnston. A good copy of Baskerville is something I’ll need eventually, but I might be better off buying a non-expert version of that for now and spending the money for a full copy of something I really want.</p>
<p>I know that if you asked Edward Johnston which font he would like, he’d probably throw things at you, but does anyone have any recommendations for a font that Edward Johnston would like using as a template?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As far as I know, Apple pre-installed version of Baskerville (Datafork Truetype font - aka .dfont) is derived from an early Monotype&rsquo;s digital version; not an optimal one, but neither anything resembling something &ldquo;almost to the point of being a slab serif&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d be curious to see your pdf, by the way, to see exactly how that Baskerville looks.</div>

<p>I dunno. Just compared to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-old-face/|URW++’s Baskerville Old Face]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-book-bq/| Berthold’s Baskerville]], it seems like they didn’t put any care into the serifs at all.  Just, the stroke has ended, so let&rsquo;s slap a big ol’ rectangle on it.</p>
<p>And since I’m using this for a large display font (not a critical work, just to set something in a PDF to stick onto an e-reader), the lack of craft will be noticeable.  It’s not critical for this work, which is why I’m not simply switching to a better font that I already have, but going forward, I&rsquo;d like to solicit ideas before I need them.</p>
