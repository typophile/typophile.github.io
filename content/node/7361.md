  second image has transparency turned on. <BR> <BR>Maybe its hard to see but it gets
  even more rough when you print it, particulary the DVD logo. <BR> <BR>Are my settings
  wrong or is this a bug/problem? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Michael'

  body: I don&#39;t have time to dig into it right now, but I believe either in the
    print dialogue box or in the preferences there are transparency resolution options.
    I&#39;m not sure if this is what&#39;s happening with your stuff.

  body: The display quality settings are high. This is even a problem when you print
    it and watch it on a paper.

  body: This is a flattening problem. One solution is to move the two objects to separate
    layers. Or if they must reside on the same layer, bring the text and vector images
    to the front.

  body: Yes it works when I move the objects to separate layers. Atleast in Indesign,
    I haven&#39;t tried to print it yet but I think it will work fine. Thanks!

  body: 'There&#39;s another way around this, and the &#34;discolored box&#34; bug,
    where a large discolored box appears when you use dropshadow or transparency functions
    on top of a spot-colored box: simply set all spot to process in the printer dialogue&#39;s
    ink setup section.'
