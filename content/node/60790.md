  I've been given Apple's Chalkboard typeface to research. So far I have come up with
  not a lot apart that apple commissioned its design and it was launched in 2003 packaged
  with Mac OS X Panther.\r\n\r\nI have hence turned to the guru's of Type to ask for
  some pointers. Does anybody know the following:-\r\n\r\nWho actually designed Chalkboard?\r\n\r\nIs
  there any special reason behind the typeface's name apart from the hand written
  black board writing?\r\n\r\nWhat is the taxonomy of this typeface, Sans, transitional
  or what what? Where can I find info on typeface taxonomy?\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have
  any suggestions of what typefaces would work in harmony with Chalkboard and which
  ones in your opinion will totally clash?\r\n\r\nIs there any history behind this
  typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTim"

    to hear that Aussie graphic design teachers haven't lost their sense of humor.
    \r\n\r\nAs you're unlikely to get much information on its design you might want
    to take a look at the relationship between it and other similar typefaces.\r\n\r\nCheers,

    Serif to write a pretty entertaining article. For example the chap who designed
    it is currently the minority owner of the Seattle Mariners baseball team. '

  body: "Tim, Chalkboard is an homage to the hugely successful Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of plagiarism is legal in North America, as there is apparently no \"point
    piracy\" involved (but you could do a comparison of physical parameters). Technically
    it may be illegal in Europe.\r\n\r\nNo self-respecting type foundry or designer
    would put their name to it, but Big Silicon can publish this font without damaging
    its reputation; Apple has no qualms about doing to Microsoft what Microsoft has
    done several times to others, most notoriously its copy of Palatino. \r\nAlso,
    there is no general outrage, because Comic Sans is a much despised face--so again,
    there is a double standard.\r\nThe fact that this is a free (bundled) font may
    also effect the optics, further lessening the stigma.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite
    Comic Sans and Chalkboard being \"infra dig\" with professional designers, Chalkboard
    has never acquired the cachet of Comic Sans, even amongst Mac users. The why of
    this may be worth pursuing; is it not as good a design, or does being a sequel
    to a well established face prejudice against it aesthetically? "
