body: "A client of mine uses TF Arrow as an identity font. They have a version purchased
  in 2000 that has no italics or small caps. Also, it is REALLY tightly spaced and
  dies at small sizes. Is Tracy faces still around? I am trying to contact them for
  EULA info about modification and to see if they have extended the family by now
  (or if they would let me do a set of small caps). I can't find them. Anybody know
  if they live? or if the name is spelled wrong?\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tfarrow_4705.png]"

    set of italics.  Didn't see small caps though.\r\n\r\n(Reasonable pricing and
    a nice EULA, too....)"
