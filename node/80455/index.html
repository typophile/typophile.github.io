  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This is my first post. I spent about 30 minutes looking through various posts and this is an interesting place. I am an independent author and taught myself the basics of typography to self publish and not appear too amateurish. I also do my own graphic design on my website, business cards, letter head, and anything for my business.</p>
<p>Previously I have purchased Adobe CS suite with a huge font pack through an educational discount, and I use Indesign, Photoshop, Word and Powerpoint for 99% of my work involving fonts.  If I use a special font in web design, I do it in photoshop and upload it as an image file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I had time/interest to really get deep into this subject. It seems like most here do this professionally and I already have multiple jobs.  I would, however, like to avoid looking like an amateur, as much as possible. Reading through The Elements of Typography has helped me format my writing better, and I am now very much aware of orphans/widows and kerning.</p>
<p>My reason for this post is to solicit advice on pruning down my font collection. Searching this forum and reading the wiki has shown me what a good basic font collection looks like, but I dont know enough about this subject to make good decisions based on that.</p>
<p>I have about 800 fonts installed on my Mac laptop, and it&rsquo;s virtually impossible for me to find browse through when thinking of a font to use for a mini project.  I think if I had closer to 100 to 200 fonts, it would be a lot easier.  More so, if I learned to break them down into different classifications.  I read a few post on sorting and the only thing I know is the difference between Serif and Sans Serif.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of &ldquo;free&rdquo; fonts that I downloaded off random sites. I believe they are legit, non-stolen, just user created fonts.  Some look good to me, but after reading some posts on here, I am learning that a lot of these are crap, and will look amateurish to use. Any recommendation on reading? The wiki and most forum posts are way over my head so I think I need to start with something more basic.</p>
<p>What should I do with my fonts?  I&rsquo;d be willing to spend a few hours reading/learning more about fonts if it will lead to a lifetime of useful basic knowledge. Is there a list of about 150 or so fonts that would make a reasonable setup for a non-power user?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Most of the &ldquo;top&rdquo; lists, especially those aggregated on the internet, are decidedly historical.
Classical and conservative perhaps, but an easy step to developing taste.</p>
<p>You could start by going through your library and classifying according to Bringhurst, and then pruning each category to those you best like the look of &ndash; favoring those which have &ldquo;expert&rdquo; features such as small caps and figure variants.</p>
