I've been trying to buy it online, with no luck, for a very long long time, and I already gave up trying to get it from a bookstore. I wish to buy it scanned from somebody, that's all.

Am I crazy trying so hard to get my hands on that book? Letters of Credit is good, but I'm a visual person and need something to look for answers quickly.

Thanks!</div>

I think you shouldn't try to get a scanned copy until you've exhausted all reasonable avenues, including contacting the author and publisher. But anyway bookfinder.com is showing multiple copies...  :-)

If the book is unavailable then, why sell it? And what is worse, they charged my card anyways.

		<div class="commentbody">Karen Chung's book is a very nice collection of comparisons, but honestly you can do the same thing if you have any font drawing software, like FontLab. Just open a bunch of typefaces you want to compare, and start copying and pasting them over one another. You can even do it in Illustrator, going to outlines. And to really study a question you have about how designers solve the design of E or e in different styles, you will want to do a lot more and different comparisons than Chung does. 

In response to Hrant, it would be great to have a newer 'book 1' on type design, including digital type issues, but meanwhile Tracy is it.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I bought the Cheng book from Amazon Japan about a year ago.  It seems to be widely available.  I doubt a.jp would ship to Russia, but I'm sure some Chinese online retailers would be able to get it.

Personally, I think it's a great book.  It's not simply comparisons, it contains a lot of brief but very useful notes about how letters are typically structured, character by character.  I imagine an experienced/professional designer would probably find most of its hints to be no-brainers, but for a beginner like me it's been invaluable.  

Lots of people recommend Walter Tracy's book, but that one really does seem to be un-purchasable (unless you're willing to pay several hundred dollars to a rare books dealer).</div>

While working on the italics of my Graphirus font I have encountered some "problems" that I'd like to check on a visual manner, but I haven't found any resources yet. I've been comparing some italic fonts and making some assumptions from that, but is a pain in the a** to do so and maybe my italics pool is not as big and varied as to get conclussions from it anyways.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I actually quite like Cheng's book for what it covers. I think it is an excellent choice for one of several books a beginning type designer could own. The book is strongest at a micro level analysis of individual glyphs and their relationships.

Significant omissions include the lack of italic coverage, and the fact that the Latin coverage is limited to western European (there’s an eszett and acute, but no ogonek or L-slash). I don't have a problem with stopping at Latin, but covering at least CE/Baltic/Turkish as part of that seems pretty standard these days.

For western readers, the book is easy to find. Amazon has it in stock, I have seen it in local bookstores, etc. Sorry that getting it in Russia is so hard!</div>

Oh. Now that is a relief. :o).

Well, Hrant, if I was to give away the book I bought, would that be OK? What about if I loaned it? 

I don't care much about legalities. They are in essence there to protect corporate interests. But I do care about a logical and a moral position and I do not see any problem giving a copy of a book to someone who is on a part of the globe where apparently no is  one is interested in selling that book. No money is lost to the publisher or the author or any part of the supply chain, because no real potential for a sale exists. 

If Mr. Graphirus chooses to distribute the book to all of Russia that would be his choice, for which he would be responsible, and, I am sure that, being a reasonable person with at least a passing understanding of the market for illicit English books about type in Russia, he wouldn't bother even thinking about for mor than half a second.

Italics are freaking awesome, as is the 14th century.

Gifting a book is awesome. Loaning a book is fine; it's what I call a "high-risk maneuver", but it's fine. The big difference between loaning a book and emailing a PDF of it is the vastly different level of sacrifice involved. Sacrifice is honorable.

I'm with you on legalities. You should see how I drive. Especially when I spot a lawyer jaywalking. I just feel better when I break the law out of principle, not convenience.

		<div class="commentbody">Fonts and Logos by Doyald Young is great. It's a much more important book for type design than Karen Cheng's book, though I like hers as well. 

Young shows by masterful subtle variations how to combine visual interest, cohesion and evenness of color. I don't know Steven Moye's book. So for me Tracy is book 1. Books two and three for me, in no particular order, are Doyald Young's Fonts and Logos and Noordzij's The Stroke. And for getting into the software Learn Font Lab Fast by Leslie Cabarga. But really the thing to study most is classic typefaces and contemporary ones you admire of whatever styles you're interested in. </div>
