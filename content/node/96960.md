body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is already a thread which describes
  what font designers do in the process of creating a font. Like whether they sketch
  or directly make the font in computer? What are their first words? Do they make
  the whole character set and then adjust spacing and kerning or go incrementally?\r\nIf
  there is no such thread can you list your procedure here.( From conception of the
  font idea to final shipment of the font)  \r\n\r\nthanks\r\nTypo"
