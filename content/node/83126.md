  and FontWhatIs have also had no luck matching. FontShop's ID and research team haven't
  gotten back to me yet, either... and I'm running out of avenues and alleyways to
  look in!\r\n\r\nSo, ladies and gents, any one know what this typeface is? I can't
  imagine that it was a custom typeface...\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\ndanse.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture-mch-logo_4030.png]"

  body: "Hey jazzhustler,\r\n\r\nA similar look and feel - nice. Unfortunately, it's
    on all their letterhead, and I'm trying to create a French equivalent logotype...
    I've also used a typeface as a placeholder - http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/astigmatic/good-eatin-aoe/regular/
    I think it has a similar playful feel, but it's too tall, and the terminals, r's,
    a's, and s' aren't the right shape.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have luck finding this
    typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\ndanse."

  body: How old is this design? Is it possible that it is an old photo-type face that
    isn't digitised? I only thought this when I came across [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/modern/|Filmotype
    Modern]] on MyFonts and remembered how little of the Fimotype library is digitised
    so far.

  body: "Hi Justin_Ch,\r\n\r\nGood question. McMaster Children's Hospital was founded
    in 1988, which is probably during the time when typefaces were converting to digital...
    though I do think it was digitized, as the digital file I have (with the outlined
    typeface) is very clean, with minimal vector-points, leading me to believe it
    was created / imported for the digital type workflow.\r\n\r\nBelow is the vector
    art, selected in Illustrator, imposed with the parent hospital's identity - Hamilton
    Health Sciences. (HHS's typeface is Lesmore Medium by Red Rooster.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mch_vector_art_4375.png]"

  body: "Another AOE font is Spruce, but the most obvious disconnect is the 'a'. I
    was hoping it had an alternate letter, but nope.\r\n\r\nRemember that it's simple
    to distort letterforms, so you may be looking at something that has been stretched/flattened.
    Another trick that kills IDers is to swap a letter or two from a similar font.
    We can look all day for a combination of letters only to find out that more than
    one font was used.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comment - and everything you're saying is
    true. And the capital \"C\" is particularly squished in this typeface.\r\n\r\nTaking
    Mike's comment into account, I think the letterform that will help identify this
    face is the lower case \"r\" - it seems to be pretty unique and I haven't come
    across one like it with other similar typefaces. Others' stems don't stand up
    enough, and the open counters almost always have a curvature to it and rise above
    the top of the stem, instead of being short, truncated, and flat. The \"M\" is
    also pretty unique, with a very upright posture, slightly wider shoulders, and
    having an \"empire waistline\" with the location of the vertex.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    else have luck finding this typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\ndanse.\r\n"
