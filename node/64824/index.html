  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>Last night I was looking to see if there was a version of Frutiger that one can license for web usages (e.g. using &ldquo;font-face&rdquo;). I came across this site and wanted to get some feedback on whether it&rsquo;s legit or not and would you use them in web design projects:</p>
<p>[[http://www.rubicon.ca/index.htm]]</p>
<p>I have to admit that I&rsquo;m relatively new to the field of typography so I thought I could get some feedback here. I&rsquo;m guessing just by the descriptions on his site that these probably are knockoffs that one wouldn&rsquo;t use in print as mistakes are much easier to see in print than they are on the web. Perhaps more importantly, I get the vibe that they might be illegal. Are they?</p>
<p>If they are legal do you think that one would be able to really notice the differences between these fonts and the originals on the web at about body sizes (say about 14-17px)?</p>
<p>Thanks,
Besim</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everyone for the comments so far. The more I look into the more skeptical I&rsquo;m becoming of Sanskrit&rsquo;s claims. I still have a few questions I think would help clear the confusion that newbies might have.</p>
<p>So are the copyright rules separate for the font design and the actual .ttf file itself?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically saying copyright has expired on these digital files that were released in 1982. This seems off as most copyright laws last 50-70 years after the author&rsquo;s death (including in Germany). I couldn&rsquo;t find any information that stated that software is exempt from this. If software is exempt from this, where does that leave font files which differ greatly from software in that a font doesn&rsquo;t become outdated like software does  (No one is really developing for the Apple Lisa anymore but Helvetica sure isn&rsquo;t going away).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many designers/developers out there who are not familiar with copyright laws regarding font files. I would imagine that searching for a legal version of famous fonts like Frutiger, Optima, etc would be a common thing and that others would also find the same site. This is the only site that I found that claims to have legal versions available to use for @font-face usage. If what he has is illegal then what can be done to stop it?</p>
<p>I would much rather prefer that a search would land someone to this thread where they can be lead to some answers that provides a clearer picture of what the case actually is than a one-sided argument that to the novice that makes it seem legitimate to use these files.</p>

Besim</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Digitising an old public domain work, i.e. converting it into &ldquo;a sequence of bits&rdquo;, does not resuscitate the dead copyright. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Project Gutenberg (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>) digitised, i.e. converted to ASCII files, innumerable public domain literary works, but this did not resuscitate the dead copyrights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you convert an old public domain shellac gramophone record or an old vinyl phonograph record into a digital compact disk, you do not resuscitate the dead copyright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you photograph an old public domain analogue Kodak photography using a digital camera, you do not resuscitate the dead copyright.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you digitize the public domain &ldquo;Stempel Garamond&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;Original Garamond&rdquo;) by converting it to a TTF font and rename it to &ldquo;Aldine 430&rdquo;</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/bitstream2.pdf">www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/bitstream2.pdf</a>, page 4 and page 12</p>
<p>you do not resuscitate a dead copyright nor a dead design right (which in the case of the 1925 &ldquo;Original Garamond&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stempel Garamond&rdquo; never existed).</p>
<p>For the USA copyright law, also consider the &ldquo;Sweat of the brow&rdquo; doctrine:</p>

So the only thing type foundries had were their trademarks - and some had been aggressively suing people who listed which knockoff fonts looked like which original fonts. (This apparently has been happening recently - books on typography were published in the phototypesetting era that had such lists, but now I hear of websites being sued.)</p>
<p>While the intellectual property of original type designers is certainly more important to protect than those of knock-off type designers, given that original type designs don&rsquo;t enjoy much protection, the claim that a .ttf file lacks normal copyright protection would threaten the intellectual property rights of the original designers of typefaces, not just those of knock-off font makers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tiger again. Hey, I hope you didn&rsquo;t actually buy the fonts from Monotype with my credit card so there&rsquo;s a paper trail leading back to us. I&rsquo;ve got deep pockets, I could end up in court like NBC! I hope you got them from a web site or p2p. I mean, couldn&rsquo;t you just take a font that ships with Windows out of the font folder and work with that? Even better, forget @font-face and just use the font to create images or use Flash. Fonts linked using @font-face usually look like crap, anyway. Or, even better, use a free font and <em>add</em> Monotype&rsquo;s name in! Maybe they&rsquo;ll issue a takedown notice and I can make a few bucks with a counter-suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>@uli</p>
<p>My understanding of the position taken by the vast majority of font creators is as follows. (And if anyone feels I&rsquo;ve got it wrong, please, please correct me. I&rsquo;m trying to present this neutrally and factually.)</p>
<p>When it became possible to record the visual features of a typeface as numbers within a computer file, the fact that the typeface could not be copyrighted, did not mean that the computer files which digitally describe them could not be copyrighted. These files are protectable as literary works.
As far as type designs that were clearly in the public domain or clearly the product of someone else, the same holds true. The original type design cannot be copyrighted but the digital file describing it can.
So, even though a font re-creates a typeface design that is clearly in the public domain, that fact is inapplicable in determining whether it&rsquo;s digital representation is, or is not, copyrightable as a literary work.
In regards to typefaces, the adoption of digital technology reset the clock so to speak - the previous 550 years of typeface design for print and the hand-done faces before that no longer count for anything in regard to whether a font can be copyrighted.
Once a typeface is digitized, the resulting files are copyrightable and will be so for the life of the creator plus 70 years. (I think that&rsquo;s the current term in the USA. Works done for hire have a longer lifespan.)
Anyway, that&rsquo;s the position as I understand it.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>rich</p>

<p>I asked three simple questions.</p>

<p>If you apply your own theory which you stated above,

<p>The theory I stated above is not my own. It&rsquo;s an attempt to summarize, as neutrally and impartially as possible, the theory I believe most font designers subscribe to as to why their font files are copyrightable in the face of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fact that typefaces are not copyrightable at all in the USA.</li>
<li>The fact that, in countries where typefaces can be copyrighted, many fonts are based on typefaces in the public domain. (As you point out quite clearly.)
I am assuming - in an attempt to explain the theory - that there must be a &ldquo;transforming moment&rdquo; where the digital description of the typeface becomes something that can be copyrighted.
It&rsquo;s just a question at what point in the process that transformation occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectually, I have my own thoughts of course, but those are private until I choose to share them. So please understand that your statement, &ldquo;apply your own theory&rdquo;, is a misstatement. It&rsquo;s not my theory.</p>
<p>That said, the answers which must be given based on the position I stated previously are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>Yes</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the theory says.
So as to not leave the elephant sitting alone in the room: Do I believe that would be the answer you would get from the average computer user?
No.
And that&rsquo;s the real problem, not who is technically legally correct. A &ldquo;law&rdquo; that fifty million people choose to disobey - no matter what the reason - isn&rsquo;t much good for anything.</p>

<p>rich</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t think font piracy was that widespread.</p>
<p>People who want lots of fonts can buy cheap font collections, they can download many free fonts, and one particular brand of word processor happens to come with a giant chunk of the Bitstream collection of fonts.</p>
<p>So, while there may be sites hosting pirated fonts, and there is a potential for fonts being installed on more machines than they&rsquo;re licensed for in offices that aren&rsquo;t paying attention to this, while font piracy probably is more widespread than software piracy is now, I would have thought that it was still on the same order of magnitude.</p>

<p>Actually Chris, for good or ill, case law is moving away from the reasoning in that one single lone ruling in Adobe v SSI. Which was, after all, in 1997. The image I find striking is that, in 1997, there probably was not a single laptop in the courtroom. Today there would probably be a dozen if not more. Don&rsquo;t underestimate changes in the Zeitgeist.
There are pirate sites out there, right? Why doesn&rsquo;t Adobe or Microsoft or Monotype or all together sue the pants off those responsible? Frankly, I believe it&rsquo;s partly because if it wound up in court with a serious adversary and unfavorable facts the plaintiffs might not be happy with the results.
1997 is twelve Internet years ago. (Them&rsquo;s like doggie years to you &lsquo;n&rsquo; me. But you&rsquo;re too young, I think, to remember <em>that</em> TV commercial. Only near-geezers remember Lorne Greene.)
Anyway, better off keeping things fuzzy and issuing veiled threats like:
&ldquo;good luck in court with all that!&rdquo;
(Just the truth as I see it, Chris, and I would do the same myself. And perhaps you didn&rsquo;t mean it that way, either. I just don&rsquo;t think that trying to create a chill effect helps anybody.)
But the bottom line is, once fonts become common components of web pages, good luck in the everyday world with this:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, even without copyright protection for the design of a font (in the US), digital fonts are widely recognized (in the US and many other countries) as being protected by copyright as computer software.

So, when font pirates talk about how what they’re doing is legal because fonts aren’t protected by copyright under US law, we know this simply isn’t true.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think any of that will end up being particularly relevant, that&rsquo;s all. Or any of our opinions, either. People are going to do what they are going to do.
And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what are you going to do?</p>
<p>BTW - Here&rsquo;s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->link<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a quick couple of paragraphs about me explaining to my wife about fonts as copyrighted software and what she can and cannot &ldquo;legally&rdquo; do. I don&rsquo;t think her reaction is untypical.</p>
