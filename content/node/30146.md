body: "What design considerations are primary in the design of the 'bar' glyph? Looking
  at some Sans designs:\r\n\r\nSometimes I see the glyph with a top height just at
  above the ascender. ( Arial, Andale Mono ). Sometimes it's a bit higher. ( Azkindenz,
  Ronnia ) or Quite a bit higher ( Fago, Consolas ). \r\n\r\nSometimes the base of
  it isn't lower than a descender, ( Fago, Ronnia) Sometimes it's exactly at the depth
  of the descender. ( Arial, Consolas, andale mono ) Sometimes it's much deeper. (
  Franklin Gothic )\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes it's taller & deeper at the same time. (
  Gil Sans, Myriad ) \r\n\r\nWhat kind of thinking informs such descisions? What situations
  can you tels to eyeball a solution? \r\n\r\n'a|3', \"right|wrong'? \r\n\r\nI would
  feel beter deciding about this if I had a better idea about how this glyph is used.\r\n\r\nWhat
  about if the design is a Monospace. How does that impact things?\r\n\r\nAt the moment
  it's seems utterly arbitrairy & opaque. Help!"

  body: "Thanks! Excellent answers.\r\n\r\nBTW Microsoft says : ( Just in case you
    would rather read it here than click)\r\n\r\n_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+\r\n\r\nVertical
    rules and bars\r\n\r\nVertical bar \r\nUnicode: U+007C\r\n\r\nBroken vertical
    bar \r\nUnicode: U+00A6\r\nHeight alignment : There is no general rule in current
    usage of these characters. Common height alignments are:\r\n\r\nVertically aligns
    with ascender and descender.\r\n\r\nVertically aligns with uppercase and the baseline.\r\n\r\nVertically
    aligns so the bar connects vertically when the document is set solid with no leading.
    For this character to connect when set with no leading the top would have to be
    equal to the highest character (often the 'Aring') and the bottom equal to the
    lowest character (often the 'Ccedilla'). These highest and lowest characters are
    used in TrueType for the WinAscent and WinDescent in the 'OS/2' table. They are
    also used to calculate the values in the 'VDMX' table. Both these tables in Microsoft
    Windows define the vertical cell height. See the TrueType Specification for more
    information about these tables.\r\nThe bottom line: What should I do? Modern usage
    of vertical rules on personal computers suggests there is no need for this character
    to be a connecting vertical rule character. Unicode characters U+2500..U+256C
    are line drawing characters and better suited for this task. Also most page layout
    programs provide horizontal and vertical rule capability.\r\n\r\nThe alignment
    for this character would be best if it is in the body height of the typeface and
    be approximately the height of the lowercase ascender and the depth of the lowercase
    descender.\r\n\r\nAdvance width rule : Placed on the en space of the typeface.\r\n\r\nSpacing
    : Horizontally centered between figure zeros."

  body: Intuitively I like it to be body height or bigger too - probably just because
    of that HTML use. But seeing all the variety in the design choices had given me
    pause. I think I will be going with my gut on this one.

  body: "<cite>I would feel beter deciding about this if I had a better idea about
    how this glyph is used.</cite>\r\n\r\nMore than anything else it's used in shell
    coding to direct the output of one command to another, known to nerds as \u201Cpiping.\u201D
    For example I might use a command to spew out a listing of every file in a directory,
    pipe the listing to another command that sorts into columns, and then pipe those
    columns into a command that strips out the ones I don't care to see. For people
    who use CLUI interfaces on a daily basis, it's essential.\r\n\r\nBut as far as
    most graphic design is concerned it's mostly used to separate words because it
    looks different from all the stuff people used to use for that purpose. For this
    reason I like to see it go really, really deep to make it stand out from l, 1,
    and so on. It also helps to make it a little wider or a little narrower than those
    characters, which makes it obviously different when they end up side by side. "

  body: "I always make it taller than the total body height so that it can be an unbroken
    vertical line. This works best with monospaced fonts and I first used it on old
    manual typewriters decades ago but you can still do stuff at the beginning and
    end of a line and with tabs if you really want too :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Why? Would Chris's model fit that kind of piping best? Why? Why not? Or does the
    design of the glyph matter on a fuctional level for the pipers? For instance,
    would be better from their point of if it touched. Or didn't?"

    body: They're usually using monospaced fonts then, so the crucial feature there
      is for it to be easily distinguished from 1, l, ! and i.
