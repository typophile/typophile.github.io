body: Ah, likely there is egg all over my wrinkled face. <BR> <BR>In a previous post,
  I said that Linotron 202 fonts were $400 each in the 1980s. I awoke this morning
  thinking, no, it was $200 each, we always bought two, the roman &amp; italic. Not
  that too many will care, but I&#39;ll look it up later &amp; post the correct price;
  in the meantime don&#39;t quote me. <BR> <BR>Sorry, sorry, <BR> <BR>Charles
