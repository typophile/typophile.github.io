  body: For what it&#39;s worth, Bison is the original name I think. The design is
    from 1935 by Julius Kirn for the Weber foundry &#40;Berthold later acquired the
    design, and perhaps the foundry?&#41;. Bitstream and URW, who were probably the
    first to digitize the design, were apparently allowed to distribute it if they
    used other names. Jaspert states that &#39;Blizzard cut by Trennert is identical&#39;
    to Bison, so that is apparently where URW got their name for it.
