  body: hej martin, <BR> <BR>not sure if you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for
    there, but try searching Dieter Steffmann&#39;s archive, plenty of old fonts there.

  body: that little lot is from the fence around the local catherdral, here in Newcastle
    upon Tyne. I have no idea how long the fence has been there, but when I took a
    shortcut a few weeks ago I cam across it and felt I had to go back and get some
    pictures. <BR> <BR>The best story about the catherdral from me, is that during
    the English / Scottish border wars, the Scottish had the city surrounded and started
    to bombard the city. So the English sent a message out to the Scottish army, that
    the Scottish prisoners had been put in the tower of the catherdral, so the catherdral
    survived the seige. <BR> <BR>Jim
