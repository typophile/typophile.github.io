body: "I'm putting together materials for an exhibition of Malevitch paintings and
  having trouble deciding on fonts. Malevitch exhibited in many early twentieth century
  group shows, and after the demise of the Donkey's Tale group, seems not to have
  associated with any other group in particular. I'm having trouble deciding what,
  if any, period fonts might be appropriate. Period grotesques don't work too well
  because of their association with Italian futurism, which Malevitch despised. Constructivist
  types seem inappropriate given the love/hate relationship of Malevitch and the Soviet
  state. Given how small a movement Russian cubo-futurism was, it seems likely that
  most people would not recognize the connections between any types that may have
  been connected to the movement, so I'm considering using contemporary typefaces
  and not even worrying about historical connections. \r\n\r\nAm I missing some great
  typographic connection to Malevitch, or should I just pick something new, or at
  least something neutral?"

    Grotesk</a> all the way. Both neutral and appropriate for the period and place.
    I wasn't aware that the (German, English or American) period grotesques had an
    overriding association with Italian futurism <em> per se</em>. Why do you say
    this?

    using grotesque types outside of low-end advertising before the 1920s were the
    italian futurists, and that grotesques only saw wider use after the developments
    in new typography at the Munich Meisterschule and the Bauhaus. \r\n\r\n<cite>google

    be a good start, but I haven't seen anything like that pop up in the research
    I've done so far, just images of his paintings."

    actually thought about it that way. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'll have time to try and track
    down some of the original books in the big library this week to see how the Germans
    handled it. But the more I think about it, the more it looks like I'll end up
    with AG, which is always a good thing :)\r\n\r\nWould it be too much to mix constructivist
    type for display use with AG for text stuff? Normally a sans doesn't go with a
    sans, but in this case I think the differences are pretty obvious."
