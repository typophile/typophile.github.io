body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nAfter a succesfull post about which g to choose, here's
  the k from expletus sans. The problem wit the k is that it doesn't look good with
  the gap at it's current spot. The bottom one is the original, but i think the the
  part of the top diagonal stroke closest to the stem (where it doesn't touch the
  bottom diagonal stroke yet) is a bit to small, making it look like a mistake. I
  hope one of the new options are an improvemen. Other suggestions are, off coarse,
  very welcome, but I couldn't find any.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance, Jasper de Waard\r\n\r\n"

  body: While the slight curve in the middle image is elegant, it looks like a mistake.
    My vote is for the bottom version.

  body: the middle image doesn't have a slight curve, must be an optical illusion.
    I think I prefer the middle version.

  body: Imo, the top version looks very cool, but I think the middle works best.
