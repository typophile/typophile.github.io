body: I&#39;ve read that Germans space combinations of &#34;ch&#34; and &#34;ck&#34;
  tighter &#40;than other languages&#41;. What is the best way to implement this?
  Is it preferable to design alternate glyphs with tighter spacing? or can one have
  OT kerning pairs that target German and accomplish the same result? Would one method
  be &#34;better&#34; than the other?

  body: I would go for full ligatures, both aesthetically and linguistically/historically.
    <BR>Just make them ample in width. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: can you expound a bit more, Hrant? i&#39;ve got to mine that deep, dark mind
    of yours! can you show any examples of exceptional c-ligs that I can look at?

    show up, then I&#39;ll do the best imitation I can. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'i acutally have another question: <BR>i&#39;m looking at the feature file
    for Adobe&#39;s Minion Pro and it has these ligatures in the dlig feature. I&#39;m
    wondering if that is the best place for these substitutions. Wouldn&#39;t it be
    better to have these in the liga feature?'

    samples at hand. <BR>Good luck.

  body: I guess the difference is that the liga feature is on by default, and the
    dlig feature is not.

  body: Ideally, these would be &#60;liga&#62; feature but only for the German language
    system tag. However, no apps are currently supporting language system tags. But
    I&#39;ve seen a prototype!

    ligatures? I cannot say for sure, but may have seen such ligatures in metal type

  body: 'Paul &amp; others,  <BR> <BR>in my opinion &#40;10 years of extensive reading
    experience in German and study at a German university, but not German native&#41;,
    setting tighter the &#34;ck&#34; and &#34;ch&#34; digraphs along as the other
    ones &#40;ss, st, sz etc.&#41; is an old habit that is no longer used nor practicable.
    Most importantly, the ligation, or pseudo-ligation of these combinations was always
    done with respect to linguistic rules. Only real digraphs were set tighter or
    ligated, while letter combinations that occured at stem boundaries in compound
    words were not.  <BR> <BR>Example: you may put an &#34;fl&#34; ligature in &#34;fliegen&#34;
    but not in &#34;auflegen&#34; because the latter is a compound of the &#34;auf&#34;
    prefix and the &#34;legen&#34; stem.  <BR> <BR>There is practically no way to
    implement it intelligently in the font -- the intelligence must be in the typesetting
    engine, and currently, I don&#39;t know any that can do it.  <BR> <BR>Since the
    &#34;c_h&#34; and &#34;c_k&#34; ligatures are of historic interest only, I recommend
    putting them in the &#34;hlig&#34; feature, and also in the &#34;dlig&#34; feature,
    but NOT in the &#34;liga&#34; feature.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam'

  body: 'Two notes of more general nature. <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41; <BR> <BR>Dan mentions
    Renner&#39;s &#34;Die Kunst der Typographie&#34;. Renner&#39;s writings on typography
    are still outstanding, and it is wonderful that &#34;Die Kunst&#34; is back in
    print. &#40;And unlike Tschichold, Renner is never dogmatic.&#41; <BR> <BR>But
    it would be a mistake to treat &#34;Die Kunst der Typographie&#34; as authoritative
    in questions of typographic details today. First edition of this book is of 1939
    &#40;the 2003 reprint is of a later, revised edition&#41;, and many &#34;rules&#34;
    in it trace back to &#34;Typographie als Kunst&#34; of 1922 &#40;Typography as
    Art&#41;. Which was a world different from ours, typographically. <BR> <BR>The
    open minded spirit of Renner&#39;s writings, however, is instructive. <BR> <BR>An
    aside. Couldn&#39;t we live well without certain local typographic habits?  <BR>So,
    in typesetting German, use ligatures wherever possible and ignore the rules of
    -- very few -- exceptions? <BR>Or, in typesetting Czech, forget about the very
    special contrast caron accent?  <BR>Maybe even find one form that would serve
    both as commaaccent and cedilla accent? <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; <BR> <BR>Extending
    Mr Twardoch&#39;s thought about using features for historic typesetting: <BR>
    <BR>&#40;a&#41;  Reserve &#34;hlig&#34; for historical ligatures like c_h &amp;
    c_k. <BR>&#40;b&#41;  Use &#34;hist&#34; for longs. &#40;&#34;Historical forms&#34;
    of M and Z as in Adobe Jenson are better considered as alternative forms dealt
    with in &#34;salt&#34; or &#34;ssXX&#34;.&#41; <BR>&#40;c&#41;  Substitution by
    longs ligatures -- like longs_i or longs_longs -- should be part of the &#34;liga&#34;
    feature. Reason is, IF you are using ligatures for f_i, f_f and others, THEN longs
    ligatures must be applied as well! To work correctly, &#34;liga&#34; must follow
    &#34;hist&#34;. <BR> <BR>This would require that applications allow to switch
    on/off &#34;hist&#34; and &#34;hlig&#34; features individually. <BR> <BR>&#40;In
    English the longs is used everywhere except at the end of a word, and longs ligatures
    are used whereever possible. In German, there are special rules, just as indicated
    with the f_f example in Mr Twardoch&#39;s post.&#41;'
