  variety of material. Is it worth it?

  body: "I think it will be difficult to find someone who has Dorian. DTL license
    holders are rare, and Dorian isn't often discussed (nor purchased, I assume).\r\n\r\n[[Elmo
    van Slingerland]] may be the best type designer name of all time.\r\n\r\nYou might
    also dig <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_quadraat_ot/\">FF
    Quadraat</a>, which has a similar Dutch pedigree but is perhaps less delicate."

  body: "Hi Thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nSo are you saying that designers rarely
    use this type or they simply do not purchase a licence? \r\n\r\nYeas I have seen
    the specimens, very good.\r\n\r\nAlso was looking at Documenta. I think they are
    lovely types."

  body: Considering the number of other quality fonts one could purchase for the price
    of a single DTL license I'd have to really really want/need one of their fonts
    to consider buying it. Yes, they are good, but the prices are absurd.

    to that their sadly unusable website only partially translated into English, and
    lack of external marketing. The typefaces are diamonds, it's the stuff surrounding
    them that's the rough."

    in the business I'm in they are addicted to sans\u2026\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Prokyon then Paul? Their PDF Specimens are great, agreed. I kinda like their
    website, you really have to be interested in the product and be willing to navigate
    it. A big plus for those purchasers in the Americas is that they seem to not care
    much for the North American market (just my thoughts\u2026) so you get some exclusivity
    in this market area. I like their fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you
    free"
