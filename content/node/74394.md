    it would benifit from contextual alternates, let me know if you are interested
    in such stuff."

  body: Very well done! I really like this! There's a certain warmth about it, very
    charming and whimsical! However, I have 3 small suggestions for further improvement.
    The capital G could be confused for a a more swashy C. The capital J could be
    a bit stronger, as it could be mistaken for a fancy I or a lazy L. The numeral
    1 could be mistaken for a 7. Other than that, it's an outstanding script!

  body: Interesting work and I would make some suggestions on caps. To me the I and
    the T are too close. I agree with Studio Becenti, the J could be mistaken for
    the L. Keep going.
