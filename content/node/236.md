  logo. <BR>The background: <a href="http://www.ontosoft.de" target="_blank">www.ontosoft.de</a>
  <BR>I did the site and the logo last year. The logo had to represent a lot of concepts
  for one sign, I believe. The stars are &#34;beginning&#34; and &#34;end&#34;, the
  swooshes are &#34;ontology&#34; and &#34;software&#34;. Finally this year, the guy
  is going global and I managed to persuade him, that the old logo is not really &#42;that&#42;
  nice, though it was my job to do it. :-/ The focus is IT and new technologies; the
  audience ranges from managers to state institutions to students; ages from 20 to
  60; different nationalities, different cultures. We&#39;ve already had a lot of
  variants discussed and tried out, but neither seems to work. He is still into swooshes,
  I am more into typo play. Here is what I have right now. The variant with O-matrix
  is just there to show you, what I&#39;ve tried and what was already declined. I
  thank you for your constructive critisism. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11168.gif"
  alt=""> <BR>Also, before you start - the variant 1 was not presented yet. Variant
  2 was presented yesterday and was marked as &#34;hmm... nice, I like it&#34;, the
  variants 3 and 4 are just my personal favourites, though the client hates both of
  them. <BR>I thank you.'

  body: Nice work, I like the fact that you tried several varying ideas.  Personal
    favorite would be wordmark no. 4, but I&#39;d like to see where it could go with
    color and maybe an accompanying symbol. The top right, no. 2, is ok but feels
    dated a bit and reminds me of an older airline logo, but I can&#39;t remember
    the name... this already is a bad thing <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  3&#39;s Good, if it was for a design related product
    or service, because it&#39;s a definite thinker, but I think it might be too much
    for the average management member, and probably for some students.  Good job though.  Definitely
    liking 4 more and more.

  body: 'thanks a lot, guys. See, the client wants to be traditional, to look older,
    than he is, but also to have a strong identity. People even say, that they like
    the old logo &#40;the one on the website&#41;, but I personally tend to hate it
    more and more. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> Anyway. I&#39;ve mailed him the following variants. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11176.gif"
    alt=""> <BR>Just received his reply: 1a and 2b. Damn! I thought he will never
    take that wording for real... He likes the &#34;bolt&#34; theme as well... Which
    airline was that, again? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    that was simple.  And 2b is just that. <BR> <BR>Solid!

    alt=""> <BR>I can still make some fine-tuning, so if you think proportions and
    position of the symbol are bad - tell me now.

  body: well, I think the 2nd to last was a bit more unique.  But hey, what can you
    do. <BR> <BR>I think proportions are good.  What type are you using for this?
    Also, looks like a different face down below, the T&#39;s look different?

  body: It&#39;s Avenir. It&#39;s the same type on every variant I&#39;ve posted here.
    Maybe just rendered a bit strangely. :-/ <BR>Yeah, I did like the earlier variant
    more, but &#34;hey, what can you do&#34;. exactly. I mean, I am struggling with
    this for, like, a month. Okay, not 8 hours a day every day, but still. I am fed
    up with trillion variants I had tried and billions the client has seen. Normally,
    I present between 3 and 5. At max. This time it was very different. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>Younger people &#40;till 30&#41; tend to like the
    earlier variant. Somewhat older people &#40;30 to 40&#41; tend to like this very
    variant. <BR>Proportions are still bothering me a bit. Maybe not really the proportions,
    but the alignment and/or distance between type and symbol...

  body: I actually was going to say something about the distance between mark and
    symbol. Seems a bit wide, but the main criteria there is to just look at its scalability.  And
    maybe, just maybe it;s a tad too big?

  body: 'Love it. The only issue is that the Ts seem to have a slight flare on their
    lower hook. That may be just an onscreen thing, but that&#39;s where all of my
    focus ends up. <BR> <BR>I really think #3 had a lot going for it. Perhaps yet
    another example of better design not winning due to lack of sales ability. &#40;That&#39;s
    not meant to be a knock towards anyone in here, I&#39;ve just learned over time
    that it doesn&#39;t really matter how good your designs are if you don&#39;t have
    a good sales-guy/gal on staff to sell it to the client!&#41;'
