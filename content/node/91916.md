body: "Hey all.\r\n\r\nI finally finished my new OT font and even tested it for errors
  and got rid of those. I haven't programmed the features yet. I'll add those soon.\r\n\r\nAnyway
  I want to start selling this font pretty soon, and I want to sell it as the single
  weight that it is right now, before I finish the other wights. It is just the regular
  weight. I am going to turn this one weight into an entire family over the next couple
  years, and I was wondering what I need to do to this first weight's family naming
  structure, in order to prepare it to snap flawlessly into place with the rest of
  it's family which will be coming out in the future. So that if a user has purchased
  the font and installed it on their system, and later they buy individual styles
  like italic, or whatever, or they buy the entire family of 5, which includes the
  font that they already have installed, what's the best way to set up the family
  naming structure and naming settings in FontLab to ensure that something weird doesn't
  happen to the user in that situation in the future?\r\n\r\nAre there any known family
  naming issues out there that anyone would like to share? I've heard that family
  naming can be one of the trickiest things about OT font creation, and I don't want
  to screw it up.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone.\r\n\r\nPS \r\nI have seen a Font\xADLab
  Stu\xADdio 5 Python Script from Cape Arcona type foundry for Font Fam\xADily Nam\xADing,
  that is supposed to \"change the font names of all opened fonts for the use as font
  fam\xADi\xADlies. The nam\xADing method will also split up the fam\xADily into single-font-families
  in the font menu in non-OT-savvy Win\xADdows applications.\" I can't really understand
  exactly what it does yet, but maybe this would be useful to some, or me. It sounds
  like it helps you properly set up font family-naming? Here is a link to it: http://www.cape-arcona.com/news/capearcona/opentype-production/

  body: "Oh I left out one last step to finalize family naming according to the book.
    In Studio 5, you are supposed to go to OpenType prefs and under Generating Opentype
    and TrueType export, you enable \"Use OpenType names as menu names on Macintosh\"
    option, (I found this was already that way) and then you select \"Append Opentype
    name record to the...\" (again I already had this). Finally under Opentype PS
    (otf.) enable \"Use Postscript Font Name as Full Name\" (I already had this too.).\r\n\r\nNow
    I'm getting ready to test to see if my family naming structure works by generating
    and installing these fonts. What's the best way to test to see if there's anything
    wrong with my family naming? "

  body: "Success!\r\n\r\nThe font family seems to have loaded into my system correctly.
    In FontBook, It shows the name of the font, and under that it shows regular, then
    italic, then bold, then bold italic, in a submenu shifted to the side a little,
    like with any other style-linked font.\r\n\r\nSuccess in Illustrator too. In the
    font menu, to the right side of the menu, after the name of my font, that familiar
    arrow is there, and when you hover over my font's name, a little popup window
    appears to the left, with a list of all of the styles (even though they are all
    just duplicates of the same weight. I just named them differently and style-linked
    them according to the instructions of the book.) This is so exciting.\r\n\r\nIs
    there anything else I can do to test out how solid my style linking and family
    naming is?"

    body: Those four 'basic' styles should also work with Microsoft products under
      Windows. What you will need to test is whether your family will appear properly
      in that environment when you add additional family members.

  body: "From reading \"Learn Fontlab Fast\", here is what I am going to do. I wanted
    to ask you guys if I should be doing something else to, but here's what I'm gonna
    do:\r\n\r\nI'm going to take my font, which is the regular weight, and I'm going
    to go Save As and rename it \"My Font-name Bold\", and then I'm going to change
    it's settings in the Font Info palette to Bold instead or Regular settings. From
    there I will work on that and turn that into my Bold weight font.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I have come to learn is that with OT fonts, you have to create \"mini-families\"
    of no more than four fonts each. Each mini-family must contain at least one \"regular\"
    font and may also have style-linked Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic fonts. If you
    have six font weights/styles total, the second mini-family would contain two fonts.
    This mini-family structure is not required by Mac, but Windows apps.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I fill in the \"Family Name\" field, I use only English upper and lowercase letters,
    numbers and spaces. Must be less than 32 characters long. All fonts within a family
    should share the same name i.e. \"Palatino\". I then set the weight and width
    settings by choosing the closest correct-sounding entries from the pulldown. I
    then pick the right italic and bold settings as the book describes. Then I hit
    the \"Build Style Name button\u2026 Each Style Name in a family must be unique\u2026
    Finally I hit the \"Build Names\" button.\r\n\r\nThen I save and close all fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    copy my four .vfb files into a new folder and open them in FontLab. Then I go
    FILE-Font Info-OpenType Specific Names. I click on the Build OpenType names button
    and repeat this step for all four fonts. \r\n\r\nThen I go back to the Names and
    Copyright main menu, and for each font, in the Family Name field, enter the name
    of my mini-family e.g. \"Palatino\" or \"Palatino Condensed.\" \r\n\r\nIn the
    Style Name, I enter one of the following values: \"Regular, Italic, Bold, or Bold
    Italic\" exactly as spelled. I click appropriate Bold or Italic boxes when it's
    Bold or Italic. \r\n\r\nI guess that's basically it?\r\n\r\nOkay I think I'll
    be okay now. Hopefully Leslie Carbaga isn't mad for basically plagiarizing his
    book. I just wanted to show you all what I do know and would like others to please
    share with me some advice even beyond this. I really want to get this perfect
    the first time I try it.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm going to do, is create duplicates of
    my Regular font, and even though they aren't really bold or bold italic or italic
    yet, I will name them so and use them as temporary placeholders. I will put them
    in the same folder, following the procedures above, naming them correctly. My
    theory is that it shouldn't matter if someone installs my regular font now and
    one of the others later if I set it up the style-linking on the 3 duplicates of
    the font correctly. And then when I finish the italic next year I'll follow the
    same naming procedures, and when they install it, the italic font should appear
    right next to or right under the regular weight in their app font menus, right?
    Why would it matter which fonts they install first, whether it's 5 minutes apart
    or 5 years apart, if I set up this style-linking correctly? Am I wrong?\r\n"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nregarding the script for correct Font Family Naming from Cape
    Arcona Type Foundry: well, it works and I can recommend it to you if you don\u2019t
    want to take care of the naming on your own. :-)\r\n\r\nWe developed it because
    we wanted to save some time and don\u2019t care about all that naming conventions
    and stuff every time. The fact, that it can process a whole family is also nice.
    We use it a lot here at Cape Arcona and are happy with it.\r\n\r\nWell, beside
    using a script to make things easier and faster it\u2019s always a good idea to
    set everything manually in Fontlab and see what comes out and how things work
    \u2013 what you already did! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas\r\nCape Arcona Type Foundry"
