    police custody' and make letterforms with our confiscated bootlaces... just like
    in the good old days.\r\n\r\n(Er, I hate to mention it, but what is typographic
    about Brighton is it was the birthplace of A.E.R. Gill.) That still doesn't mean
    I know why AtypI choose it, other than it's presumably cheap off-season.\r\n\r\n'Punch
    & Judy' might make a good theme. Or 'Brighton Rock'."
