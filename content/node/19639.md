  body: "Hi Jimsbee,\r\n\r\nTook a quick peek.....fun face.....I visualize it used
    in woodburning boutique shop signs or something like that.....it has that rustic
    feel.\r\n\r\nLetterform thoughts:\r\n\r\nDo you really want to make such an idiosyncratic
    statement with 'C' and 'G'? All the other letters are very stable and freestanding,
    but these lean backward.......there's plenty of character in these letterforms
    as is, or at least I think so!\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of Agfa Rotis in this respect....I
    have always been critical of that face because the lowercase 'e' and 'c' look
    so out-of-place with the rest of the characters. There isn't the same instability
    hinted at in any of the other letterforms.....\r\n\r\nIf you're sold on the 'C'
    and 'G', you might want then to revisit the other rounded letterforms like 'O'
    and 'Q' to see if they too should become less vertical in their slant.\r\n\r\nMore
    about the 'Q': The tail looks perhaps too \"tacked-on\" to me. It only intersects
    the main stroke at one point instead of overlapping a bit....the body of the 'Q'
    is identical to the 'O', and since both are so vertical but the tail of the 'Q'
    is naturally shifted to the right, it makes the 'Q' look a little backward-leaning
    to me as well...\r\n\r\nOh, and one more quick thing: I see that the top of the
    'S' responds to the raised bars of the 'A' and 'H', but the narrowness of the
    upper aperture still seems smallish compared to say the attitude of the 'G' aperture.
    That makes the 'S' appear to tilt away from the viewer in perspective to me....\r\n\r\nNice
    work - Cheers!"
