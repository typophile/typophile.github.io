  typeface examples (to purchase), and also if there is a translation tool that is
  also available.\r\n\r\nI have travelled to Thailand (more than once), and think
  the typefaces are very lyrical, and some, beautiful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nJ"

    commerical Thai type design is in pretty poor shape, and apart from some government
    funded open-source projects there''s not a whole lot going on.  '

    one could go and discuss this with various successful agencies in Bangkok, but
    beyond that....\r\n\r\nJ"

      in Thailand, so I assume they are being offered legally.

  body: "On Adobe's behalf I commissioned a four-member family of Thai fonts (\"Adobe
    Thai\") a few years back. It ships as a language pack for Acrobat 7.05 and later.
    I was very pleased with how they turned out - the design was done by Fiona Ross
    and production by Tiro Typeworks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Acrobat licensing
    precludes you from using these fonts with other applications for authoring purposes.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
