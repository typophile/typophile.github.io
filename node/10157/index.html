Ultimately, it makes things more difficult for me (a paying user) when rebuilding a hard disk upgrading a PC with a new hard disk. I've had experience with the windows photoshop activation and its awful. Once I had to call adobe's activation line and the automated process kept rejecting the very long number I keyed in.

But then it occurred to me that OpenType's table structure and capacity to handle new, arbitrary tables in the future without harming existing functionality means that we could do this in OpenType 2.0. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We just have to figure out how to put physical instantiation into a table. Also, the cost of arbitrary fabrication systems capable of building physical objects based on computer-based instructions needs to come down. But they only cost $20K today (according to a recent piece in The Economist), so if we apply price reduction at rates equivalent to Moore's Law (improbable, but just for fun)&hellip; mmm, in about 13.5 years arbitrary fabs will cost about $40 so every computer will have one. Then you could just have a new OpenType table that contains instructions for building stuff, and have it build the thing that goes and gets your drink from the fridge. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, if you're willing to wait until late 2018, no problemo! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Bill, in 300 words or less, which errors are those? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's a preview of an upcoming review: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Let's see what optical kerning does to one of Adobe's own most recent state-of-the-art fonts, Adobe Garamond OT Pro. Consider the simple word 'jumps' at 12 points. This word sets perfectly and doesn't require any kerning. It has been carefully optimized by Adobe's designer Robert Slimbach to have absolutely perfect spacing at this point size.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now let's specify Adobe's 'optical' kerning. InDesign subtracts 23 units of space between j and u, adds 14 units between u and m, subtracts 16 units between m and p, and -1 units between p and s. The result is atrocious. The u is now too close to j, and there is a noticeable river of space between u and m. A well-made font has been rendered useless. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's the same story no matter what font or setting you choose. Adobe's 'optical kerning' isn't a feature &ndash; it's a liability. Worse still, it's featured in Illustrator and Photoshop. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe has gambled that its target customers will not be able to tell the difference between a professional font rigorously spaced by its original designer, and a complete mess-up spaced by its guesstimator. I don't agree. My faith in designers is greater than that.&quot;</div>

InDesign's optical spacing wasn't meant to be used only with Adobe's fonts, or Carter's fonts, it was meant to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a lot of people, and most fonts most people use have imperfect spacing. Take Mrs Eaves for example, a font that many people love, to the point that they ignore the font's horrid spacing: InDesign renders Mrs Eaves actually usable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anybody free of a visceral, burning desire to strike down Adobe at every turn in the berserker rage of a jilted lover (think Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction) can see that InDesign's optical spacing is just another tool, that can be used or misused. It is better than not having it, and that's more than can be said of many things, certainly most fonts! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; My faith in designers is greater than that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Faith, shmaith. Most fonts are spaced badly (you of all people should realize and admit this), and InDesign's optical spacing makes them less bad, that's all. A good typographer simply knows when to use it and when not to. Think of it as anti-lock braking on a car: there are more people who need to avoid rear-ending the car in front of them than there are people who need to perform a controlled slide. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crocodile faith. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;I generally work with a font's built in kerning and then flip on the Optical Spacing for display work and fine tune from there. Often saves a lot of hassle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, Stephen, I suspect the reason you see a slight visual improvement is that the predominant action 'optical kerning' takes is tightening. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->May I suggest that you simply track negatively instead? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with 'optical kerning' is that it tightens disproportionately and incorrectly - and when it thinks it has to add space, the results are usually disastrous.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The advantage of using simple negative tracking is that you preserve the correct spatial relationships of the font. (Unless it is just a shareware cockup - in which case, what are you doing using it to start with?)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The profound disadvantage of 'optical kerning' is that it distorts the original spatial relationships of the font in an irrational and unpredictable manner.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It requires only the simplest analysis of any of its suggestions to see where it almost invariably goes wrong. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is really great about the feature, though, is that it makes it so easy to determine exactly where and how it has gone wrong. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My position is that it is simply indisputable that the traditional technique for dealing with display sizes - used since phototype - is the best: negative tracking. 'Optical kerning' is a gimmick gone wrong. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know that deeply respected font folk from URW have worked on this intensively, but I believe their work has been in vain, primarily because the program still does not look at actual stems. Analyzing white space has been tried by a hundred programs a hundred times, and just doesn't work. Never has, never will. EvB and JvR tried doing this in a much more sophisticated manner, and ultimately conceded failure. The only thing that is surprising here is the number of worthies that were taken in on this latest occasion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There remains the suspicion that 'optical kerning', though of dubious merit for professional fonts, can be of value for badly spaced shareware fonts. I can't agree. If the program cannot understand a well-spaced font, it cannot understand a badly-spaced font. It seems clear that whatever slight benefit might exist is just due to generalized tightening that could be achieved better with simple tracking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have yet to see a single documented test which establishes that 'optical kerning' actually understands what it is doing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But this isn't an issue which needs to be argued theoretically. Arguments for either side can easily be demonstrated by simply mentioning the settings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have shown that 'optical kerning' will hopelessly mangle the spacing of the word 'jumps' in Adobe Garamond Pro. Can you provide us with some examples in which you can consistently show that 'optical kerning' actually performs well? (Especially when tested against simple negative tracking?) My suspicion is that in at least 95% of cases, 'optical kerning' will make visibly deleterious decisions. And my position is that no program can even begin to know how to space or kern until it is aware of actual stem positions. This, clearly, Kernus/URW/optical kerning cannot accomplish and indeed it is too much to expect, in a WYSYWIG context.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If the type designer knows what they are doing&ndash;and I think Stephen alluded to this&ndash;there is no reason to use Optical Kerning. However, in display instances, usually only a handful of words, starting with Optical Kerning is not a bad thing as, most likely, the designer is going to be hand-tweaking the type anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For instance, House Industries cannot do bad kerning. I think it is genetically impossible for them. For giggles I assigned Optical Kerning to some of their type and it goes to crap, seriously awful stuff. This proves to me&ndash;and I doubt very much&ndash;that Adobe intended Opt Ker to be used all of the time. It is a helpful tool but, like any tool, when used incorrectly can only cause the windows to be put in upside down.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; the predominant action 'optical kerning' takes is tightening. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incorrect. The spacing is depending on point size, with smaller sizes generally getting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->loosened<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is of course what's required. I've actually graphed the algorithm's behavior, and it's &quot;bilinear&quot;: a straight line between 4 and 12 point, another (shallower) straight line between 12 and 72, and no [further] change below 4 and above 72. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, it's probable that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->overall<!-- raw HTML omitted --> InDesign's algorigthm tightens more than loosens, but I would think that's due to most fonts being spaced too loosely (it's easier that way, after all). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; May I suggest that you simply track negatively instead? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, because that ignores &quot;boundary conditions&quot;, like the right side of the &quot;r&quot;. Fooling with the tracking is a brute-force approach that's generally much worse than what InDesign would do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One problem with InDesign's algorithm though: if you apply tracking to text that has optical spacing enabled, the tracking is still applied &quot;blindly&quot;, leading to the boundary issues above; I think it would have been much better to take the opportunity to apply the tracking adjustment as a &quot;recommendation&quot; to the optical algorithm to change its parameters. But maybe there are performance issues (which is why I think the alogirthm is bilinear and not outright smooth). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Unless it is just a shareware cockup <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There's a difference between a font with good forms but lousy spacing, and a font that's good in both. There are very many fonts in the former category (probably because most people in type design are aesthetically competent but analytically lacking) and these are the ones that benefit most from InDesign. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Analyzing white space has been tried by a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; hundred programs a hundred times, and just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; doesn't work <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It hasn't been done to the point of matching a good human spacer, I agree, but it's really the only way you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->could<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get close to it!

Many people who have given up wouldn't have if we paid them enough.

It looks like what you have accomplished here is to use +10 tracking to negate the 'optical kern' between o and r and decrease the metric/optical kern between t and o. Then, both you and Kernus/Indy have chosen to open the tight space between r and t - in fact you have chosen to open it considerably further than Kernus/Indy would have chosen. That is clearly not what the designer(s) of the font would have chosen, but, regardless of its value as a personal choice in setting the word, what possible reason can Indy/Kernus have to offset the intended aesthetics of the font with so much additional white space as an automatic choice? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, I would like to see some evidence of perfected behaviour here. Setting display type with an auto kerner and then having to add +10 tracking &ndash; which is, let's face it, a drastic corrective &ndash; doesn't make the case. I'm not saying it can't be done, but I await evidence that Kernus/Indy is making rational choices with any consistency. Far be it from me to encourage you to waste more time on this, but can't you come up with something a little better?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, Adobe warmly recommends using optical kerning for text and makes no mention that the system should be preferred for display that I can find.</div>

Then, both you and Kernus/Indy have chosen to open the tight space between r and t - in fact you have chosen to open it considerably further than Kernus/Indy would have chosen. That is clearly not what the designer(s) of the font would have chosen, but, regardless of its value as a personal choice in setting the word, what possible reason can Indy/Kernus have to offset the intended aesthetics of the font with so much additional white space as an automatic choice? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, I would like to see some evidence of perfected behaviour here. Setting display type with an auto kerner and then having to add +10 tracking &ndash; which is, let's face it, a drastic corrective &ndash; doesn't make the case. I'm not saying it can't be done, but I await evidence that Kernus/Indy is making rational choices with any consistency. Far be it from me to encourage you to waste more time on this, but can't you come up with something a little better?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, Adobe warmly recommends using optical kerning for text and makes no mention that the system should be preferred for display that I can find.</div>

Determining the width of the sidebearings is part of spacing, and so is adjusting serif shapes to accomodate the way glyphs fit. Kerning is a last resort. So, with a radical departure from the traditional rendering of baskerville, Licko had a lot of decisions to make along the lines of: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;These two characters are a bit far apart; shall I solve the problem by (1) changing the sidebearings, (2) changing the serifs, or (3) applying kerning?&quot;  And of course, one small change in one character pair will have ramifications elsewhere.</div>

I have demonstrated that in any serif font, at 12 points, InDesign/Kernus will invariably subtract space from ju and add space to um. This is not acceptable behaviour.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the conclusive proof is that for any serif font (indeed, I think for any font at all, including ornaments) InDesign will always alter the most fundamental spacing pair of any font: nnn.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is not defensible behaviour on any grounds. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't believe that in the - what - five years? - so called experts have been yakking about this junk program, nobody has ever thought to make these most fundamental tests.

But I knew this was going to happen anyway, and I'll leave that task to someone more determined to waste bandwidth. For me, Enough! La commedia e finito!</div>
