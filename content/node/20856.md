body: "Sorry I don't have an image to show yet, but the machine attached to the scanner
  is archiving, and likely will be all day. So this will prove a good test of my ability
  to describe, and your ability to put these disparate clues together. And while I
  enjoy flipping through my books and catalogs to do the detective work, other work
  beckons at the moment. And I couldn't find the face on What the Font.\r\n\r\nThe
  serif font used in Cottage Living magazine has these qualities:\r\n\r\nOverall,
  a very similar feel to Centaur; the LC y terminates very much the same, but the
  horizontal stroke on the LC e is horizontal, not at an angle\r\n\r\nLC p: lower
  part of the bowl stroke follows through the down stroke for a unique letter. Not
  calligraphic, but not a serif, either. I don't know the technical term for that
  type of termination, if there is one.\r\n\r\nLC t looks more like that of Galliard
  than Centaur\r\n\r\nLC g looks more like that of ITC Garamond than that of Centaur\r\n\r\n*Is
  that enough to go on?"

  body: This is a challenge. From the tiny images on the web and your description,
    perhaps it's <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/more.html">Requiem</a>?
    See any Qs or Rs?

    a larger cover image.</a> Boy, that logo is awful. Does it say "cottage living"
    to you? To me it says "messed up Trebuchet".

  body: You nailed it, Stephen, thank you. It is indeed Requiem. I knew I'd seen the
    face. And I agree with you, that logo doesn't say "cottage living" at all.

  body: Yes and so artfully integrated into the logo. Sheesh. Wonder how much someone
    got paid for that.
