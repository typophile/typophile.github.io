  body: "I assume you\u2019re validating a TrueType font and that the error appears
    in the section for the PREP table?\r\n\r\nIn that case it appears something is
    wrong with the code for the TrueType hinting. Did you do the hinting in FontLab
    only, or also used other tools?\r\n\r\nBTW: There is a help section in Font Validator
    where every error code is explained a little more in detail. It\u2019s in the
    same directory as the application itself."

  body: AutoHinted TT in FontLab only. I've read the explanation of the error codes.
    I'm trying to find a way to correct it. All of that TT Table and Bit stuff gets
    a little dense to me.

  body: I'm sort of disappointed the the FontLab folks haven't comment on this. I
    mean if I get this cascade of errors from their auto-hinting, you'd think that
    would be of some concern.

    it is though. '

  body: "James, I'd be happy to take a look at your FontLab source and font, if that
    might help. I've never seen these errors in fonts I've generated from FontLab.
    Are you using the Windows or Mac version of FontLab?\r\n\r\nThe PREP table is
    editable in DTL OTMaster, although I've never attempted it."

  body: "Thanks for the offer John, I design on the Mac and generate all final fonts
    on the PC. \r\n\r\nBut this is all so very interesting. The vfb files that I'm
    using to generate the fonts that are giving me these odd error messages are fairly
    old, they go back to 2003 or so. I might have made them with FL 4.x (could they
    be as old as FL 3?) That is the version I started on.\r\n\r\nI created a new vfb,
    copied all of the font header information from the old data, copied all of the
    glyphs and appended them to the new file, copied the features and the classes,
    and generated a new font, and none of those rasterizing errors were present, when
    I ran the new font through Font Validator.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if they were really
    errors or some odd sloppy file housekeeping inherited from some old version of
    FL.\r\n\r\n"
