body: Looking to ID the font used by Flavia Greeting Cards in their logo.  Go to <a
  href="http://www.flavia.com" target="_blank">www.flavia.com</a> to view.  Script
  with spiral flourishes.  Does anyone know what this typeface is, or if there is
  anything similar available as a shareware/freeware font???  Thanks for your help.

  body: That is certainly hand drawn, Ken. Look at repeating characters, not only
    in <BR>the logo, but in the various other places on the site that script is used.
    Those <BR>repeating characters are always a bit, or much, different. <BR> <BR>For
    example, there are lots of &#39;a&#39;s and &#39;e&#39;s in the various words
    and they all <BR>vary. Look at the word Free on the &#34;About Flavia&#34; link
    and there&#39;s even a much <BR>different &#39;F&#39; than is used in the word
    Flavia. <BR> <BR>As far as similar fonts go, realize that there&#39;s no way to
    actually match a <BR>flowing, calligraphic, varying script like this, but give
    us a few minutes to think <BR>up suggestions for fonts with a similar &#34;feel&#34;
    &#40;if someone hasn&#39;t already done <BR>so by the time I post this&#41;. <BR><br>

  body: Ken, <BR>As Mike said the &#39;Flavia&#39; signature and some of the site
    lettering looks like it was hand-drawn. Since there are fonts with alternate characters
    and endings, it&#39;s theoretically possible that a font was used, but I would
    expect it to be a custom one. The curly spirals would be pretty memorable if this
    were a commercial font, I think. <BR> <BR>The lettering shown on that site for
    the wording of the greeting card, does look like a font &#40;identical letters
    look identical&#41;, but I didn&#39;t try to ID it as it wrote on the screen.  <BR>
    <BR>There are a couple of places to look for similar fonts in the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html"
    target="_blank">ScriptFont ID Guide</a>, such as Part 10, Part 4, or Part 7. You
    might find the font used for the &#39;animated&#39; cards that way.

  body: Thank you for all the suggestions and comments. <BR> <BR>I wasn&#39;t limiting
    myself to shareware/freeware fonts - just had hoped I could find something close
    in the shareware offering. <BR>Would gladly purchase, if I knew this was available
    commercially.  I have sent an inquiry to FLAVIA.com.  If I come up with anything,
    I&#39;ll let you know.  Let me know if anyone comes up anything close <BR>
