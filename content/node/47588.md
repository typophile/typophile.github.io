  ID Pop Quiz.</li>\r\n<li>Try to identify the glyph and the typeface. To win, you
  need to name at least:\r\n<ol><li>typeface</li>\r\n<li>weight</li>\r\n<li>character/glyph</li></ol></li>\r\n<li>Show
  off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it,
  when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your
  fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The winner produces a new challenge -- a portion
  of a glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including
  a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The person who posts a challenge can't
  win the next game.</li></ul>\r\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury
  and avenging angel of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is a little too difficult,
  maybe try the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/entry_level\">Entry Level Type ID Pop
  Quiz</a> or <a href=\"http://typophile.com/intermediate_level\">Intermediary Level
  Type ID Pop Quiz</a> first.\r\n\r\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>With

    Elena Albertoni.\r\n\r\n<em>Kigara was Elena\u2019s first attempt at designing
    a text typeface. The result is not exactly a conventional book face. \r\nStrongly
    influenced by handwriting, Kigara is best suited for short texts set at medium
    to large sizes. However, its open letter shapes and subtle serifs make it a very
    readable face in smaller sizes as well. Kigara will also make headlines as a modest,
    light-hearted display typeface. \r\nKigara is named after an African mushroom
    - hence the mushroom vignettes and African ornaments in the OpenType version and
    the \u2018B\u2019 set. Both the sets also include small caps, alternate figures,
    special ligatures and other expert glyphs.</em>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s your turn now!

    unicase.\r\n\r\nIt's the designer's first name that starts with an F. Last name
    starts with an R.\r\nAlso, the foundry has a language-specific character in their
    name, which is interesting because that character isn't used in the language that's
    spoken in the (European) country where they are based. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, this particular
    font was given away for free by one reseller in the past; though not any more.\r\n\r\nAnd
    there is still that other hint: This font was mentioned on Typophile on February
    2 \u2013 and in a forum you like to frequent. :-)\r\n\r\nI might post another
    glyph in a bit\u2026"

  body: "Hello Satyagraha!\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t designed by Christian Schwartz. Perhaps
    you were thinking of Farnham? It does seem to borrow Fleischman details in the
    terminals.\r\n\r\nThis genre of typeface is designed for worst case printing scenarios,
    however in this particular instance it\u2019s biased towards display work although
    you could use it very successfully at small sizes. \r\n\r\nIt was designed by
    one of the world\u2019s most important living designers. The designer set a portion
    of his book in this face.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    getting this one!\r\n\r\n:-) \r\n\r\nThe name of this gem is Ionic by Matthew
    Carter from Carter and Cone\u2014one of very few \u201Cspeculative\u201D typefaces
    Mr.Carter designs.\r\n\r\nThis is my most favorite Clarendon in the world. Other
    interpretations look blurred by comparision\u2014this one sparkles! It can work
    well at very small sizes, although Ionic\u2019s details, texture, and contrast
    make this typeface a pleasure to work with at display sizes.\r\n\r\nIonics (a
    sub-genre of Clarendon if I\u2019m not mistaken) are also the newspaper form of
    Clarendon\u2014very short ascenders and descenders.\r\n\r\nIonic is the Matthew
    Carter\u2019s book and in the Indie Fonts specimen book Volume One (red cover).\r\n\r\nI
    can attest it is in fact very well kerned.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CCIonic_6355.png]\r\n\r\nPlumbago
