  and then re-create it using Adobe software...all I can say is that it was intense!
  I didn't think it would be as difficult to go from hand work to the computer...which
  scares me a little when I think of what a task it will be to create a typeface!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p_letter_5738.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0449_6101.jpg]"

  body: Hi Reba! I really love what you did with the image. Taking it into the computer
    gave it a totally different feel. I can't see the details very well though, what
    does the type in the body forms say?
