  have to prepare a design concept for a contemporary magazine of my choice.\r\nI
  have chosen to produce a \"classy graffiti\" magazine. \r\n\r\nA 6 page spread is
  required showing research on two type faces, one historical (pre 1970), one contemporary
  (late 20th/early 21st century).\r\n\r\nResearch must include the designer, design
  development, foundries, distinguishing characteristics, uses, personalities.\r\n\r\nI
  have searched but am finding very little.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any fonts and
  where I can get the information for the above.\r\n\r\nThanks All.\r\n\r\nChristoph."
