    American magazines.

  body: I really like the voice and legibility of Chronicle, but I'm finding that
    it shows kerning much more readily than, say, Minion might. I think other faces
    may have a bit more flexibility in that regard. Not that it's a bad thing at all,
    just that it is something to bear in mind if you're planning to use it extensively
    or if your layout has narrow columns; fitting copy is going to depend more on
    editing the language of the text than fudging with kerning and leading.
