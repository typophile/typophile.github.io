  body: "It's amazing to me how much variation you can find in these four letters.
    I have looked at Garalde styles until I am cross-eyed. The closest I can suggest
    is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/\">Adobe Garamond
    Premier</a>. Your sample seems a bit softer, but perhaps that's an artifact of
    the resolution? If it is this font, it may have been vertically stretched a bit.
    What I kept looking at was the shape of the serifs and the counter of the Y (a
    sort of arrowhead shape)\r\n\r\nMy first feeling was that it was softened <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/\">Bitstream
    Arrus</a>, and that's maybe the best alternative I can suggest. Arrus seems sharper
    than this sample, but maybe the image affected this, or some extra stroke was
    used to soften the points. Arrus seemed close because the serif edges are slightly
    curved, as they seem to be in your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
