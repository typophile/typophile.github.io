body: 'I am working on this logo for a luxury airline, this mark is meant to appeal
  to business people, because every seat on this airline is first class.The lex and
  the air work as a whole. I&#39;ve added the tag line because the brand is unknown
  and comfort equates to luxury - I have narrowed down the selection to two styles...
  do you think either of them say luxury airline business? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-post.pl?action=posting_upload_form&what=show&img=63489"

  body: I think the logos you present here does not feel luxury. One of the reasons
    is because you&#39;ve tried to fix and trix almost every letter. Nothing in the
    layout takes a stand therefor it feels &#34;vulnerable&#34;. Don&#39;t be afraid
    of just being laid back with the text and work more with the composition. And
    pleas take a good look to the space between the letters... get the similar feeling
    between all letters.

  body: Joe is there any reason Airlines should be as important as Lexair? Take a
    look at making Lex one color and air another and make Airlines tiny. LexAir is
    stronger than Lexair Airlines. As for the type, your trying to do to much with
    it. This is business people and not designers your trying to appeal to. Keep it
    straight, use a nice type face like Clearface

  body: Hi Joe <BR> <BR>I like the angular nature of the first logo, and especially
    the X - A combination. But as Stefan points out, there is not enough continuity
    between letters. Also it has a slightly comic-book lettering look, probably not
    what you want for a logo which inspires trust. Also is there a reason the lettering
    is slanting backwards?

  body: Tom, the letters are slanted back like a reclineing chair, laid back and comfortable.
    Though I&#39;ve also looked the sraighten letters. Stefan The letter space is
    the should be the same for each letter except the x and the a so it shows they
    are connected. Alessandro, I don&#39;t this commic book lettering says luxury.
    I might consider clearface as a possible alternative. Thanks for the advice guy!
    Any other opinions would much appreciated.

  body: Joe I like the new direction but don&#39;t letterspace Airlines. make it the
    width of Lex or air in Lexair. Position it under either Lex or air. The new direction
    is much more business oriented, nice work

  body: I liked the first ones better than the Helvetica or Clearface ones. <BR> <BR>This
    is a tough design challenge. The fuselage demands  <BR>something short and wide
    and the tail demands something  <BR>narrow and tall. Tough to find the right balance.
    <BR> <BR>The staccato letterspacing in your first example would be tough  <BR>to
    balance with the similarly spaced windows running the length  <BR>of the plane.
    &#40;Not that it can&#39;t be done, but it takes caution.&#41; <BR> <BR>Clearface
    doesn&#39;t say luxury as well as it says &#34;maple syrup&#34; or  <BR>&#34;corduroy&#34;
    or maybe &#34;strawberries and cream.&#34; And steer clear of  <BR>Arial/Helvetica
    for this one. <BR> <BR>Luxury brands need luxurious type - extra large and hyper
    thin  <BR>or elegant and understated. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.aveda.com/"

  body: I personally do not equate vanilla to luxury. Dark chocolate, yes, vanilla,
    absolutely not.  <BR> <BR>Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Kate Spade, Celine, Pucci,
    Versace, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, Karl Lagerfeld, Tiffany, Alexander McQueen, Tristan
    Webber, Clements Rebeiro <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t jetBLUE all first class? Or was that
    some other airline?  <BR> <BR>I think the second option is too friendly. But that&#39;s
    me. I don&#39;t necessarily equate luxury with friendly. :^/

  body: Actually, I like the word Airlines letterspaced.  Letterspaced says airy akin
    to flight.  It is also good to change the speed of the line in contrast to Lexair
    which is a fast line.  Airlines letterspaced is a slow line.  I would choose a
    light sans for the word though, the serifs make it look too busy.  I agree with
    Joe Pemberton on the font selection. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Sheesh, none of these are getting me exited at all. Not to be cruel but unless
    you&#39;re willing to look at the Luxury Brand comment and examples your were
    given more seriously I think you should move away from a type foucused mark here.
    You&#39;re not getting it yet. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no reason not to try your
    hand at something more illustrative and potentially more explicit. Don&#39;t forget
    many logos have ideas embedded, so far these don&#39;t have any luxury ideas in
    them just flying ideas and that&#39;s already very common out there. This logo
    has a particular advantage. It hasn&#39;t been made yet. It hasn&#39;t filled
    Chapter 11, or lost luggage, or had to bump a passenger. Let the mark show that
    it&#39;s fresh and that luxury is something that is mysterious, especially in
    a time of fear and redundant securities and armed air marshalls. You have a lot
    of work to do here. Make the client earn this logo. <BR> <BR>Rock On.

  body: As I was looking at a few magazines tonight I realized that this thread was
    in the back of my mind as I flipped the pages.  <BR> <BR>It is impossible to put
    the weight of selling anything as luxury solely upon the typeface--not that this
    is what is being done here--because a product is luxury because of so much more
    than just one part of it. However, the right typeface can set the stage...in fact,
    it does set the stage if nothing else has been done thus far. <BR> <BR>Do you
    have any information other than what you&#39;ve shared that might shed more light?
    <BR> <BR>Lancome, for instance, uses an OCR font for the copy in combination with
    the serif logo &#40;and sans sub-logo&#41;. But the thing that REALLY sells it
    as luxury--pretending that I know nothing of their actual products--is the enhanced
    lips shot. After you notice that gorgeous image you then notice that it is Lancome
    and then you read the copy.  <BR> <BR>What does luxury mean to you? Upper East
    Side or Tribeca? Palm Springs or Las Vegas? Cashmere or good cotton? Satin or
    Egyptian cotton? Who the target audience? Entrepreneurs or Tycoons? Or by luxury?

  body: The right type selection does not have to say luxury, here, the color selection
    can say luxury. Studies have proven that the color blue is calming and creates
    a sense of ease&#40;or any dark shade of a color for that matter&#41;. An atmosphere
    that is comfortable is also luxurious. I think the type has to have a certain
    amount of sophistication and Clearface accomplishes this. The tracked out type
    on the bottom ads balence to the overall mark, without subtracting from the LexAir
    portion of the word mark. Since this is a new brand, it is important to use the
    name some how in the mark to help identify this new company, which a logo by it
    self or attached to this wordmark cannot bring attention to LexAir, because there
    is a millon airlines out there but there is only one LexAir. <BR>thanks everyone
    your comments are very helpful <BR>
