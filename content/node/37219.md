    was running around in Washington? Park playing soccer with the (relatively) little

    by the traffic, I have yet to meet anyone in person who cares the least little
    bit about fonts. Like I needed to feel more like a freak than my other interests
    make me.

  body: Portland is only a little ways away from Seattle, why not hook up with some
    of us up north? There's actually quite a group here, as some of us figured out
    at Typecon. And I guess if push comes to shove, we could always come down there.

    only participate a couple of times per year when I visit :) I will definitely
    move back someday, but it might be a few years down the road.\r\n\r\nI think I
    have told you this before, but Mike Kippenhan, a teacher of mine from PSU, was
    working in typography/type design at one time I believe. He is partially responsible
    for my turning to the dark side of type :) And there is Pete as well, who you
    have already mentioned, from Plazm.\r\n\r\n@Fontplayer: I used to live in your
    old 'hood! I was on Burnside and NW 22nd place for a spell, and then about 3 different
    apartments on St Clair, right on the SW side of Burnside (behind the Chevron there).\r\n\r\nI

    Whenever I go there, I get the \"Tiger's Blood\" flavored sno-cone, which is a
    mix of raspberry and coconut. Forest park is pretty cool too. You can be surrounded
    by dense forest only a few minutes from downtown. I'm not a \"zoo bomber\" but
    I have ridden the route from the Max station at the zoo into downtown. In, my
    case, I did it on a normal bicycle with decent brakes. My impression of type wonks
    in PDX is that often they're too busy actually doing stuff to lurk in online forums.
    \r\n\r\nI thought Pete's presentation at TypeCon was great, btw. We <em>should</em>
    have TypeCon in Portland. "

    that I switched to flute when I gave up the music business. \r\n\r\nIt took about
    3 days to produce a decent note, between seeing stars from too much oxygen. And
    then in about two months I was good enough that some people asked to join their
    band. Later I added electronic effects (and ended up making more money playing
    flute part-time than I did before as a 'pro': life can be strange)."

    more fun and interactive. Somehow, the idea of forming a band that sing songs
    about type and design seemed genuinely appealing\u2014much like what Burn Back
    did for advertising and Jonathan Coulton for sci-fi.\r\n\r\nSo, you know, any

    Printers</a> or <a href=\"http://www.texturaprinting.com/\">Textura</a>? They
    seem to do some cool print-related stuff in Portland. For Stumptown, I think a
    significant amount of their income is related to music packaging. \r\n\r\nHere's
    a Portland moment: Today I went downtown to visit the Powell's, the largest book
    store on Earth. As usual, I spent a few minutes looking through the rare books
    room. In particular, I asked to examine a 1591 printing of Aldus's <em>Institutiones
    grammaticae</em>. It's possible that it was printed by Aldus' grandson, I don't
    know very much about old books. I made a sincere effort to look like I was being
    very careful with it. When I was handing it back to the clerk I mentioned how
    amazing it is that books like that are for sale. He shrugged and explained that
    as a Buddhist, he didn't personally own very much stuff. \"I guess it's kind of
    ironic that I work with rare books.\" he said. \r\n\r\nI didn't buy the book,
    although it's an interesting idea. If it was easy to resell, it might be much
    easier to just buy books like that if I want to look at them. I know that libraries
    have rare books available for examination, but they seem to get nervous if you
    don't have an obvious reason for looking at stuff. And, obviously you can't check
    them out.  "

    call (if you don\u2019t mind, have time)? Speaking of lyrics, all I have now is
    various geeky one-liners and song titles, like:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Baby, kern me closer

    one sort of lyric, but am too embarrased to post it publicly.\r\n\r\n<strong>Carl</strong>:
    Not personally, but have heard about them/seen their stuff more than once. I know
    the good guys at Pinball Publishing somewhat better.\r\n\r\nI heard that there
    is an organization that held letterpress classes in Portland as well. I checked
    it out about a year ago but never got around to participate.\r\n\r\nHmm, I never
    know that Powell\u2019s had <em>Institutiones grammaticae</em>. Haven\u2019t been
    much in the Pearl room. I have to check it out sometime.\r\n\r\nAbout having the
    TypeCon in Portland: definitely! We have <em>more than enough</em> graphic designers
    that are curious about type. Seen them all over at the last Helvetica screening
    (including some familiar faces.) Did you have a chance to watch?\r\n\r\nAnd would
    you be interested in joining the type club, if this thing ever takes of?\r\n\r\n<strong>Zara</strong>:
    I tried emailing my only contact at PSU, Lis, but haven\u2019t got a word back.
    Know any direct way to contact Mr. Kippenhan? Maybe his email? The guys at P22
    might have it, but I\u2019m not sure."
