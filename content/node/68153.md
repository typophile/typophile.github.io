  of any Indesign Template or Website that i could a get a template then copy/paste
  a specific font and take to the laser printer to check how the font works? A fast
  test drive for fonts which include its family' variations for text.\r\n\r\nI guess
  is something like that\r\nhttp://www.levien.com/type/atf_1912/p0739_sm.jpg\r\n\r\nor
  that\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TitilliumText14L\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ChunkFive\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  guess i could do it by hand with each font but it will take me quite a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  help or ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSebastian\r\n"
