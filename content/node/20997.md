    like your idea - should be a typowiki - but the trick is then to get new posters
    to check it before posting their request...\r\n\r\nThere is this site for brands,
    but it doesn't list the fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.brandsoftheworld.com/"

    entry?

  body: "Hmm, the problem with this is that most/many of logos were custom-drawn or
    modified workhorse fonts (Helvetica etc.).\r\n\r\nFor example, brother can't be
    Chalet as Chalet was only recently released, I'm guessing it's custom drawn. \r\n\r\nThere
    is a <a href=\"http://users.ncrvnet.nl/mstol/56.htm\">good website</a> that manages
    to name the typefaces each company/brand uses in their collateral material.\r\n"

    I know that site [I'm a contributor as well], and it is a good source for some
    works.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you think it's better for the forum, this could be removed

    pretty limited list but very helpful.

  body: "No worries!\r\n\r\nHowever, I've found that website to be slightly inaccurate.
    For instance, it straightforwardly lists IKEA as using Futura and New Century
    Schoolbook which is not really correct as IKEA uses custom versions of both, but
    near enough I guess. ;^)\r\n\r\n"

    If we did have such a FAQ those could be topic areas within it, perhaps. We repeatedly
    get posts from people who obviously ignore our FAQs and instructions about thread
    naming, but maybe we can at least help ourselves by compiling these kinds of lists
    in a place we can all find easily.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It's interesting that their lists are in a 'Typowiki' too. The list being
    in German is not much of a factor understanding Company & font names, but the
    lists are rather narrow in their scope, and heavily weighted towards German firms.
    Broadening it to include a wider selection would be more useful. If there was
    a way we could contribute to it, we might share the resource somehow with them,
    which seems like a nice idea for two similar sites.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    just a list with companies and according typefaces. \r\n\r\nBut I admit it is
    too german-centered. But, well, this list wasn't shown here and some german Companies
    are known worldwide. :-D\r\n\r\nPS: FYI, the term \"Unternehmen\" means \"Company\",
    \"Schrift\" means \"Typeface\" and finally \"basiert auf\" means \"based upon\". "
