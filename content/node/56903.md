    of different possible original Spanishes and nothing comes up.  It also doesn't
    seem like something Borges would say anyways, though I could certainly see him
    having included it in a story as a line from a narrator or character.\r\n\r\nJust
    be careful, it's very (extremely) likely he didn't actually say it.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Thanks everybody! Dan, Will do. Matthew, you make a very good point. I will
    see if I can find out more about the quote. I do recall Borges lapsing into a
    very old fashioned way of thinking when it came to nationality eg that he was
    willing to generalize, albeit in a witty way. Also, I think holding position seriously
    in this sense was maybe outside of his interests*. But people are sloppy and it
    could well be that it is not his or that a character of his says it.\r\n\r\nI
    don't have my Library here in Reading, and the Uni is closed for a while now,
    so finding those references is not going to happen quickly.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    \"Borges: I think that the meanings are more or less irrelevant. What is important,
    or the two important facts I should say, are emotion, and then words arising from
    emotion. I don't think you can write in an emotionless way. If you attempt it,
    the result is artificial. I don't like that kind of writing. I think that if a
    poem is really great, you should think of it as having written itself despite
    the author. It should flow.\" http://www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm"

    I checked and there was an up-to-date version (with all the CE characters) in

  body: "<em>Ricardo, interesting. I\u2019ll need to go and look it up to see the
    context. I\u2019m only familiar with a handfull of his interviews.</em>\r\n\r\nHey,
    guifa, Eben has provided a link to an interesting-looking interview (above): \r\n\r\nhttp://www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, at one point Borges says of Federico Garc\xEDa Lorca, \"And then, it
    was a lucky think [sic]  for him to be executed. Best thing to happen for a poet.\"
    A somewhat poor translation, but that quote is pure evil, and pure Georgie. ;-D\r\n\r\nBut
    also check out his comparison of languages:\r\n\r\n\"I don't think languages are
    essentially synonymous. In Spanish it is very difficult to make things flow, because
    words are over-long. But in English, you have light words. For example, if you
    say <em>slowly, quickly</em>, in English, what you hear is the meaningful part
    of the word: <em>slow-ly, quick-ly</em>. You hear <em>slow</em> and <em>quick</em>.
    But in Spanish you say <em>lentamente, rapidamente</em>, and what you hear is
    the <em>-mente</em>. That is gratis, so to say. A friend of mine translated Shakespeare's
    sonnets into Spanish. I said that he needed two Spanish sonnets to a single English
    one, since English words are short and to the point, but Spanish words are over-long.
    And English also has a physical quality to it. Well, in English, you can say:
    <em>to explain away</em>. In Kipling's <em>Ballad of East and West</em>, an English
    officer is pursuing an Afgan horse thief. They're both on horseback. And Kipling
    writes: 'They have ridden the low moon out of the sky./ Their hooves drum up the
    dawn.' Now you can't <em>ride the low moon out of the sky</em> in Spanish, and
    you can't <em>drum up the dawn</em>. It can't be done. Even such simple sentences
    as <em>he fell down</em> or <em>he picked himself up</em>, you can't do in Spanish.
    You have to say <em>he got up the best he could</em> or some lame paraphrase.
    But in English you can do much with verbs and positions. You can write: <em>dream
    away your life; live up to; something you have to live down</em>. Those things
    are impossible in Spanish. They cannot be done. Then you have compound words.
    For example you have <em>wordsmith</em>. It would be in Spanish <em>un herrero
    de palabras</em>, rather stilted, rather uncouth. But it can be done in German
    you can make up words all the time, but not in English. You are not allowed the
    freedom that the Anglo-Saxons had. For example, you have <em>sigefolc</em>, or
    <em>victorious people</em>. Now in Old English, you don't think of these words
    as being artificial, but in Spanish it can't be done. But of course, you have
    what I think is beautiful in Spanish: the sounds are very clear. But in English
    you have lost your open vowels.\""
