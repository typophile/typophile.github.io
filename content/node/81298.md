  a Sans-serif and uploaded a picture in which the font was placed on a blue sky background,
  in the lower part of the image the roof a building is shown. The font's colour was
  white. \r\n\r\nI can't remember the name of the topic/author and it's a rather new
  post, but i can't find it. I discovered it on Wednesday 13th. \r\n\r\nHope you can
  help me out somehow\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nBirdyie"

  body: "No, it wasn't that post. Hmm... the image was rather small and didn't need
    to open a link, the image was directly posted. The font had changing characteristics
    (In German you say: \"Wechselzug\"/\"Fett-fein-Kontrast\"/\"Duktus\", I don't
    know the english word, I posted a picture that you know what I mean).\r\n\r\nThe
    font was written in majuscules only (I think), without serifs, every letter with
    a low width and large height.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.inhousemarketing.de/uploads/pics/bodoni_merkmale.jpg]]"
