  Tables/Food tables on my food packaging design...at the moment i have got\r\nhelvetica
  as place holder on my design...\r\n\r\nFrom what i have seen and read..the typeface
  for Nutrition Tables/Food tables its generally\r\nHelvetica,Franklin Gothic or trade
  gothic ( i think in the states they recommend to use in on the food label?)\r\n\r\nI
  like the look of FF Milo (ias it has a nice large xheight and looks\r\nawesome small
  print - first saw it on fontfeed) and Galaxie Polaris a new typeface designed by\r\nChester
  Jenkins.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a good alternative to helvetica that prints good
  very small and perhaps has a larger x-height?\r\nor you think i should just stick
  with helvetica for the Nutrition information?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time, appreciate
  it!"

    parameters:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/nleatxt.html#General/Formal%20&%20Print%20Size\r\n\r\nBut
    Helvetica and Franklin Gothic are specifically used in the government example,
    so everybody probably uses these so as to guarantee that the label won't be found
    in violation of the requirements.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/nutri18.gif\r\n\r\nI
    applaud your interest in making your label nicer, but just be careful that you
    don't end up causing your company a lot of headache with fines and reprinting
    costs.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "Awesome thanks for some of your guys Suggestions... I don't have to worry
    about a company as this is a student project however i am trying to get the finish
    product/package looking like industry (supermarket) level obviously.\r\n\r\nkentlew
    - cheers for the links, however in New Zealand hey don't really specify i recommend
    typeface for Nutrition information like that did on that site. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/consumers/food-labelling/understanding-food-labels/\r\n\r\nOverall
    i guess im a little subjective to use Helvetica as i feel it is overused and i
    tend not to use it in my work.\r\nHowever since its so familiar i think consumers
    will wonder whats different if i was to change it dramatically?\r\n\r\nthats why
    i guess many people do use helvetica as its a pretty safe typeface, and you can't
    go wrong with it.\r\n\r\nthe food labeling is for a children's snack...but the
    parents would no doubt be reading that information/buying the product.\r\n\r\nBut
    if anyone else has more alternatives, that would be much appreciated... i will
    have a go to see what the suggestions look like\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"
