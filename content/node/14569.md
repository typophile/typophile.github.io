  glyphs. Often characterized as [[text figures|oldstyle]], [[lining figures|lining]]
  and [[tabular figures|tabular]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Codex_Vigilanus_4373.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>The
  first appearance of any numerals in a manuscript in Europe:\r\nCodex Vigilanus,
  written by a Spanish monk in the year 978</em>\r\n \r\nThe first printed books did
  not make use of [[Arabic numerals]] at all. None of [[Gutenberg]]\u2019s printings
  contain any Arabic numerals. [[Ratdolt]] was one of the first to use printed Arabic
  numerals in his books \u2013 many of which were about mathematics and astronomy.
  His numerals left behind any traces of medieval forms and are immediately familiar
  to the modern eye. The zero is a perfect circle. [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]]\u2019s
  zero was a perfect circle, as well as the zeros in [[Claude Garamond|Garamond]]\u2019s
  typefaces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ratdold_4978.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Numerals
  with perfect circle zero by Erhard Ratdolt, 1482.</em>\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aldus_Griffo_4507.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Numerals
  with perfect circle zero by Aldus / Griffo, 1502.</em>\r\n \r\n[[Francois Guyot]]
  was one of the first type designer (or was he the first at all?) to cut both a roman
  and an italic related to each other, evidently with the idea that both may be used
  together. He used exactly the same numerals for both the roman and the italic typeface
  (as one can see in the Folger type specimen of c. 1565). His zero is a perfect circle.
  (BTW, perfect circle actually means perfect circle - the counter in one of Granjon\u2019s
  typefaces was drilled, as one can see in Fred Smeijers: \u2018Counterpunch\u2019,
  p 158.)\r\n\r\n[[Ameet Tavernier]] was the first punchcutter who designed inclined
  numerals for an italic typeface, but he did not dare to touch the perfect circle
  shape of the zero, so the zero is upright and not inclined.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tavernier_5876.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Numerals
  for an italic by Ameet Tavernier, 1554\r\nThe numerals are inclined, except perfect
  circle zero.</em>\r\n \r\nApproximately at the same time, [[Robert Granjon]] cut
  his first italic with inclined numerals, but he also slanted the zero, which therefore
  turned into an oval. It is very interesting to observe that Granjon, even if he
  abandoned the shape of the perfect circle, retained the other characteristic feature
  of the zero, its monolinear stroke thickness. He must have found it important to
  still keep the shape of the zero different, while trying to bring the design of
  the numerals closer to the design of the italic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Granjon_5345.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Numerals
  for an italic by Robert Granjon, c. 1554\r\nThe zero is also inclined, but still
  monolinear (without modulation in stroke thickness)</em>\r\n \r\nThe introduction
  of numerals of equal width (one of the two features commonly attributed to the so-called
  \u2018tabular figures\u2019 as opposed to the so-called \u2018old-style figures\u2019)
  preceded the new design of numerals of uniform height. Already in 1764, [[Pierre-Simon
  Fournier le jeune]] wrote in his Manuel typographique about numerals of equal width:\r\n\r\n\u2018The
  figures of the roman have no respective sets, but one uniform one. They are all
  cast to the thickness of an n-quadrate; that is to say that two of them put side
  by side make a square of the size of the body.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe first numerals of
  equal height were cut by [[Richard Austin]] for the founder [[John Bell]] in 1788.
  It was the zero that suffered most from this treatment, since it was both squeezed
  into a far too narrow horizontal space and stretched to capital height at the same
  time.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20616\">\"0\"</a>\r\n<a
