  some student work</a> from a class taught by Oded Ezer, involving translating Latin
  logos into Hebrew. (Has this been discussed here already?)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  I don't read Hebrew, but this Hebrew version of the New York Times logo just won't
  leave my mind.\r\nI've thought a lot about Hebrew Blackletter since reading some
  of Hrant Papazian's comments about it, and this is an interesting example, although
  I don't know enough to understand how good it is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oded_ezer_class_nyt_3990.gif]"

  body: "To put it lightly and not to hurt anyone involved, I would say this looks
    quite bad!\r\nNot only does it look very amateurish and awkward - feels very forced
    and completely out of place, it's mostly quite illegible in an unappealing way.\r\n\r\nIs
    this a serious practice or kind of tong-in-cheek joke? Cause your link doesn't
    work.\r\n\r\nI bet with a little more research into Hebrew calligraphy and (maybe)
    more skill this could make much more sense."

  body: I don't know Hebrew either, but this does not look like Hebrew at all. Generally,
    I find the idea of forcing a style of a specific script on another one very awkward
    and does harm more than good. Instead of translating the specific style, one needs
    to translate the feeling behind it, so for this example I'd choose some Hebrew
    style that give the impression of old, antiqued type (or whatever you think blackletter
    stands for).

  body: "I had thought that the miniscules of the Hebrew logo were a fairly good application
    of the style to the Hebrew character. But reproducing the Latin minuscule - majuscule
    structure in Hebrew is a mistake.\r\n\r\nThus, I would see a Hebrew blackletter
    as being in \"all-caps\", but with the characters much less ornate than the capitals
    of Latin blackletter, being much closer to the lower-case of the example given,
    but in a larger size."

  body: "Awkward or not, it is a funny exercise. Or: it could be. I remember examples
    of Cyrillic and Greek blackletter designs being discussed here.\r\nI have no Hebrew
    expertise, but I think the main mistake is in the distribution of stress in the
    letterforms. For Latin vertical stress is essential. For Hebrew horizontal stress
    is essential. This has been neglected. \u2013 I\u2019d like to see some Hebrew
    type master executing this!"
