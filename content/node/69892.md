  involved with a collaborative not for profit magazine project to be created by people
  who were stuck in a foreign land with too much time on their hands.\r\n\r\nThere
  will be photography and illustration but I post here in case anyone might be interested
  in submitting typographic material or accepting typographic assignments to help
  with features?\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, please send me a message letting me
  know where you were stuck, where you were trying to get to and what you're free
  to do. A link to some of your work would also be appreciated. We'll consider pretty
  much any styles.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for taking the time to read this. \r\n\r\nMatt"
