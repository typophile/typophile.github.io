  own BaldCondensed talked about using typefaces you personally dislike (or aren't
  particularly keen on) - forcing yourself to use them - consequently keeping your
  design work fresh... Does everyone else have their own method to keeping/maintaining
  a fresh approach to their design work? It hit home with me because I have become
  selective in my old age (28) which means that I've got a set of favourite typefaces
  I use, I'm set in my ways with grids, and I've just realised (I couldn't quite put
  my finger on it before) that I'm not striving to push myself further...\r\n\r\nThanks
  Yves, I'd stayed away from the fonts I didn't like - and people are going to give
  me stick for this - serif faces have pretty much fallen right out of my font palette!
  I'm going to try and stick a few in my next project and try and appreciate them
  a bit more!\r\n\r\nSi"

    you've had great bites on, and you find yourself reaching for them again and again.\r\nThat's
    not bad in and of itself, though. Certain typefaces just have a resonance with
    certain designers, and it's natural, just like having favorite musicians, painters,
    etc.\r\nBut the real FUN starts when you stumble upon something new or overlooked
    and see the beauty in it. To that, I'd say, try a new font. Experiment with a
    bold you've never had much use for before. It's fun, and helps you stretch. But
    in the end, understand the \"right\" type for a particular piece (which you can
    only determine with a broad exposure to faces) -- not using something just BECAUSE
    you don't like it or think it doesn't work."

    you approach a project as a unique problem requiring a solution, you can keep
    a fresher outlook. Bucky Fuller was great for throwing out preconceived answers
    in order to stay open for discovery."

  body: "I once used a face which I didn't like at the time (Copperplate) on purpose
    on an antiwar poster.  I did it because I was trying to show war as an ugly thing.
    \ I even deconstructed the font to push the negative side of it to me. As much
    battering as I did to Copperplate, changing the stems to look like spent brass,
    it held up quite well even when used small!  I ended up with a new-found respect
    for the face and no-longer dislike it.  (I might try to find it and post a link
    if anyone is interested.)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Thanks guys for your comments... I think Hrant's hit the nail on the head...
    \r\n\r\nI think my compromise would be a trip to London (I'm based in Derby, UK)
    so I can get out and see some design/general cool things to inspire me. I can't
    afford traveling around abroad because I'm broke!\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any
    London-based design exhibitions coming soon? London seems to be geared to fine
    art - the Design Museum's the only obvious choice. Anyone know places off the
    beaten track that are good to go and take in?\r\n\r\nTa very much!\r\n\r\nSi"

    (hopefully!) I seem to go through 'I can't design' patches every so often - I

    it to London yet, but am looking forward to in the next month or two. Unfortunately
