  insists on this script font Vivante DTC which I frankly don't like at all. I need
  your advice. Could You please suggest a nice script font or a serif font with nice
  italics which goes well with the illustration? Thank you very much for your suggestions.\r\n\r\n*

    Bold Italic retains some of the angularity of the current font and works with
    the Roman type below it and on the back label."
