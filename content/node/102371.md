  body: "Thanks, Craig! The {g} showcases the new style of descender that I built
    just prior to the release. The solid stroke of the descender is steeper and protrudes
    less to the left, and conversely the thin connecting stroke is now less steep,
    instead matching the 39\xB0 angle of the cuts of the vertical strokes.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I've slightly revamped my marketing material thanks to some comments on the TypeDrawers
    board, and put them up on Behance: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Gryffensee-a-geometric-blackletter-%28incl-Cyrillic%29/8236533
