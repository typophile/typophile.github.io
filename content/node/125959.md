  plaque. I can use any font I want. I want the sign to be clean and readable, but
  still have some sense of the era. Most of my research is turning up Victorian-stye
  typography, which doesn't fit with a midwestern Central Business District rehab.

    not, try Goudy Old Style, Centaur, Clarendon. "

  body: I haven't decided yet, but probably not. It's a larger plaque than strictly
    necessary, so it will include extra historical information and a black silhouette
    of the structure. It's still up in the air. Thanks for your suggestions. I'll
    take a look!

    body: "It's the Western Newspaper Union building. I understand it worked something
      like an AP service. They would create inserts or plates here and ship them to
      of independent presses across the country. \r\n\r\nFrom the registration documents:\r\n\r\n\"The
      Western Newspaper Union Building [preferred] at 304 W. 10th Street, Kansas City,
      Jackson County, Missouri is eligible for listing in the National Register of
      Historic Places under Criterion A for its local significance in the area of
      COMMUNICATION. In 1901 the building at 304 W. 10th Street was constructed for
      the A. N. Kellogg Auxiliary Newspaper Company to house their printing operation
      that sold pre-printed auxiliary newspapers to over fifty-five (55) small town
      newspaper and quarto publishers in a three state area...\r\n\r\nThe early development
      in the auxiliary or ready-print newspaper (also known as boiler-plated newspaper)
      industry in the United States began just prior to the Civil War c. 1860. Several
      small printing firms in the northern portion of United States began following
      the work of Cassell, a London based publisher (c. 1857), who supplied approximately
      150 newspapers with ready-printed sheets of national news and advertisement
      in England. The operation in England remained a small scale process compared
      to the American adaptation in which the process was expanded to become the largest
      systematized news gathering and distribution method in the world.\"\r\n\r\nIf
      you're interested just google \"Western Newspaper Union Kansas City\" and the
      PDF is in the first SERP.  It's too large to post here, else I would do it for
      you.  It's now being used for a technology services company, and for apartments
      on the second floor. There were no press plates, type samples, or anything of
      interest when we bought the place. I scoured every inch of this place. "

  body: "You stated you wanted the sign to be clean and readable with some sense of
    the era. I can well imagine an American Gothic in use there. I really like the
    revival of <a href=\"http://atftype.com/atf-alternate-gothic.php\">Alternate Gothic</a>
    but my first pick to try out (if it should be clean and more modern) would be
    Tal Leming\u2019s <a href=\"https://typesupply.com/fonts/balto\">Balto</a>.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for a newspaperish text flavour, try a Scotch. Something from
    the Century type family or a contemporary one like <a href=\"https://www.typography.com/fonts/chronicle-text/overview/\">Chronicle</a>
    could work.\r\n\r\nFor additional research on your own, flip through digitized
    books of American Type Founders of that era, like this <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/americanspecimen00amerrich#page/n0/mode/2up\">specimen
    from 1912</a>. (Oh, and if you need a display or headline typeface resembling
    the octagonal \u201CWestern Newspaper Union\u201D lettering from that photo you
    posted, give one of the narrower styles of <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sportsfonts/winner/\">Winner</a>
    by Christoph Koeberlin a try. There is also a sans-serif upcoming but I might
    prefer a serifed version.)"
