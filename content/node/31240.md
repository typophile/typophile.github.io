body: I've been working to add a number of new characters to my font.  In the file
  I'm attaching, I've got one page each from Homeric Greek (polytonic), Golden Age
  Spanish, Old Church Slavonic, Anglo-Saxon, Vietnamese, and Armenian.  How well does
  the font hold up in each one?  Is there anything that strikes anyone as odd in any
  of them?  The last page includes some random quotes from Wikipedia to show off how
  each script "feels" in the presence of the others.  Any suggestions?

  body: "And hrm, it appears font forge messed up a few Cyrillic letters again.  So
    a few of them like \u043B or \u0438 have some odd distortions.  Also hinting (at
    least on the Mac) seems to be a bit off, but zoomed in looks fine.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "So these are meant as complements to Berling? Okay. Let's see what I can
    say about them.\r\n\r\nI'll start with the Greek. The contrast is one thing that's
    getting you. You have thins that are way too thin (iota, mu, delta, psi, tau,
    epsilon, eta, finial sigma) and thicks that are too thin (phi). A lot of your
    letters look warped, like the mu, upsilon, delta, alpha. The kappa has overhang.
    The nu has a terminal with no relatives in any of your other letters; the gamma
    and the terminal of the bottom beta bowl are similarly alien. Also, I think you
    should have just one stress scheme in the font--the lambda and chi have old-style
    stress, but the rest of the alphabet is modern. One thing that's bugging me throughout
    the alphabet is the outstroke/instroke, the one with a little bit of thickness
    on the end (iota, tau, pi, eta, upsilon, and others).\r\n\r\nIn all the scripts,
    I'm seeing more thickness on the right side of the o than on the left. (omicron,
    o, Russian o).\r\n\r\nI can't really offer any critique on the Russian until I
    see a sample that isn't garbled.\r\n\r\nThe \xF0 should be designed of its own
    accord, not put together from an inverted 9.\r\n\r\nI can't really say anything
    about Vietnamese or Armenian, though I imagine Hrant might come by and say something
    about the latter."

  body: "Nice catch on it being based on Berling.  I've fallen in love with the font
    and been working on it since.\r\n\r\nWhat is a better source to use for the tails
    in Greek?  I was working with a slightly smaller O and chopping at the extrema
    on the right.  It's my first attempt at anything non-Roman so I figured I'd still
    screw up a lot, although most of the native Greeks (granted, not type face designers,
    but do programme localisation) that saw it didn't notice anything.  How would
    the chi and lambda look in a \"modern stress\"?  A much thinner top left to bottom
    right stroke?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the os are unchanged from the original Berling
    (they are just set as references to the Latin o).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/allpurposetemp_4176.PNG]\r\n\r\n1. Garamond
    Premier has classical stress. 2. Minion has modern stress. (Note which stroke
    is the thick one in each letter.) I don't know if these are the broadly accepted
    terms for the two kinds of stress, but they work okay for me.\r\n\r\nAs for a
    \"source\" for your tails, I can't recommend copy-pasting it from anything in
    particular; much better is designing it freehand. The \"a\" might be a good place
    to get inspiration, but definitely don't copy it. Design it to look good; that's
    all I can really say."

  body: "Okay I've uploaded two new files.  One of them is the test file without cyrillic
    distortion as well as another sample text in modern-day Bulgarian since the old
    Cyrillic doesn't quite look the same.  \r\n\r\nAs should be obvious in the glyphList
    file there are a number of characters still in the process of being made, I just
    took the output directly from FontForge's print entire font function.\r\n\r\nI
    think the tails look a lot nicer now, I realised I had them only about half as
    thick as they should be (basing the thinnest part of the tail on the thinnest
    part of the lowercase O).  I also gave it an ever so slight rounding off on the
    edge and that's made a big difference from my POV.  The eth has also been updated.

    why Bill Hill chose it for the original MS Reader. But its extreme vertical proportions
    are pretty much guaranteed to cause problems in other scripts, including Armenian.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I know I still owe you a proper review of your Armenian.\r\nEspecially since I
    admire the fact that you're working on it at all!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "What the hell, things are quiet on the home front - I'll just do it now.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I'm going just by your TypeSample2; your glyphList isn't coming up\r\nfor me,
    which means I'm almost certainly not seeing all your characters.\r\n\r\nThe main
    structural problem is where you're missing parts, like the rightward bars at the
    bottoms of za and liwn. A much less obvious but almost as important structural
    issue is the severe shortness of the descenders (coming from Berling); besides
    making the result less readable and less culturally authentic, this also results
    in some letters looking pretty horrible, like the sha, cha and jheh.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the following letters are malformed:\r\n- yiwn is way too wide.\r\n- ca is just
    mangled.\r\n- eh needs to be wider, with a stronger descending curl.\r\n- ja is
    a Latin pastiche.\r\n- What's that flick in the AYB?\r\n\r\nThere's issues, like
    the ho being too Latinized,\r\nbut those are on another level of refinement.\r\n\r\nSorry
    this took so long!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
