  body: The ZANG typeface came up here before, but I don't remember what it was called.
    It was from late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Pretty sure it's never
    been digitized, though.

  body: "Devroye has one mention (last line of quote):\r\n\r\nGlobe Gothic\r\n\r\n\xB6
    Globe Gothic is a refinement of Taylor Gothic, designed about 1897 by ATF at the
    suggestion of Charles H. Taylor of the Boston Globe, and used extensively by that
    paper. But Taylor Gothic has mostly the same lowercase as Quentell, though with
    hairlines heavied a bit. ATF's Central Type Foundry branch in St. Louis claims
    to have originated Quentell (q.v.) in 1895 or earlier. The conversion to Taylor
    Gothic was designed by Joseph W. Phinney, while the redesign as Globe Gothic in
    about 1900 is credited to Morris Benton. It is a serifless, thick-and-thin face,
    distinguished by the high crossbar on E, F, and H. The angular end on the stems
    of V, W, and most lowercase letters. Globe Gothic Condensed, Extra Condensed,
    and Extended were designed by Benton about 1900. Globe Gothic Bold and its italic
    are also credited to Benton, in 1907 and 1908 respectively. But Frederic W. Goudy,
    in the book on his typefaces, says, \"This type (Globe Gothic Bold), drawn at
    the suggestion of Joseph Phinney, followed in the main certain points which he
    wished brought out. It never had much vogue and is the least satisfactory (to
    me) of all my types.\" This is puzzling, as the bold departs somewhat from the
    style of the lighter weights, but is not at all characteristic of Goudy's work-nor
    of Benton's, for that matter. Studley of Inland Type Foundry was similar. Compare
    Ryerson Condensed, Radiant, Matthews, Pontiac, World Gothic. "
