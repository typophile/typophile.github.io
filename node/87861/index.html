I remember it was used a LOT on a children's TV show here in South Africa that I used to watch back when I was a kid in the 90s. So, can anybody here PLEASE help me out?

It's nice to see you have such faith in us that you think we should be able to ID anything, but saying "Come on, guys! No one know? Seriously?!" doesn't strike me as very polite, considering you are not our only 'customer'.

Did you try writing to the site owners where you saw this used?

Very clever, managing to tell me what you would have said if you WERE rude. 

The fact that your post went unanswered from Nov 29th to Dec 8th may tell you that this isn't an easy one to answer, so I felt that saying "Seriously?" was uncalled for. Usually people just say something like 'Any (other) ideas?" If that's your idea of talking down to you, I suggest you need to lighten up too. We try to answer all posts as soon as we can, and I've been here doing this for about 8 1/2 years. I looked at thousands of fonts on four different sites before giving you my answer..

.. so, you are welcome.  I hope we can all be friends here.

Au contraire. We all recognize sarcasm.

And you use the word sarcasm as if it were a good thing. 

AHD4:
1. A cutting, often ironic remark <em>intended to wound.</em>
2. A form of wit that is marked by the use of sarcastic language and is <em>intended to make its victim the butt of contempt or ridicule.</em>

There are a few regulars who often stoop to sarcasm, but most give of their time and expertise graciously.

If you want help, don't bite the hand that you want to feed you. Be snotty at your own risk, especially after constructive criticism.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Constructive criticism my big fat foot. He wanted rudeness, so I showed him how I am when I aim to be rude. HE was the one being snotty, I just amplified it. As I previously stated, I will not allow anyone to talk down to me. He has absolutely no right to. Just because he's been doing this for 8 1/2 years does NOT mean I should be forced into supplication before him -- or for anyone else for that matter. He made several ASSumptions about me and the situation, and they were not appreciated by me. If you wish to misinterpret my words or intentions, go right ahead . . . but don't make the mistake of telling me or putting it out there so I can find out about it. I have always been polite here and grateful for the help I have received here, but I refuse to be grateful for help that stems from someone who's clearly got their head up their own butt. And sarcasm can be a very, VERY good thing when a situation calls for it. =)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Frans,

you have to teach yourself that written communication through net, 
follows it's own rules. 
Misinterpretation occurs often, and YES you have to explain yourself politely every time it happens instead of biting the other.
...and no, sarcasm is proved to NEVER be a good thing, when it comes to a first contact through net.

I thought you had a problem of identifying a font, 
but it seems you have a problem of always saying the last word.
