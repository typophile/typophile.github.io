  body: "Isn't it super cool?! The content is all amazing... The website has the Flash
    look without using any flash. it's all Java so it even works on mobile devices...\r\n\r\nIf
    you view the profile of each individual artist there is usually a link to their
    personal portfolio on the web... check them out!\r\n\r\n"

    individual sites! My site stinks. MUST do better.

  body: "Glad to share! My site needs a serious update as well. I have noticed that
    a lot of designers are now managing there sites with Wordpress(Not using templates).
    It makes it much easier to manage content. \r\n\r\nHere are two portfolio sites
    that are powered by Wordpress\r\nhttp://savsec.com/\r\nhttp://www.hollisbc.com/\r\n\r\nThis
    is probably the route I will end up going in. "

    I found while doing research. They have a ton of samples with a lot of Diversity
    so I wouldn't be surprised if they are always looking for new talent...
