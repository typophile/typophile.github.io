  I have visions of the type being really spacious and simple but with maybe some
  small detail there to or twist to the logo to make it a bit fun and fresh. It could
  be just the suggestion of an already exsisting type face that is just beautiful
  that i might look at, anything and everything suggestion wise would be greatly received.\r\n\r\nI
  have never used a forum before, (i know i think i have been living under a rock
  for the past 10years) but i hope this is the kind of question or queiry you can
  put out there. \r\n\r\nThanks so much for your time and look forward to hopefully
  getting some ideas back...\r\n\r\nAll the best, \r\n\r\nAlice"

  body: Just to play devil's advocate, what if you made your "clean" logo very dirty?
    Or maybe make everything around it dirty? A treatment that says what it is often
    falls flat. (There's nothing wrong with it, but it has to be really brilliant
    to succeed.)
