    You might want to check out Perla instead.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/Perla\r\n"

    isn't from Muse, the band, is it? They're climbing the scale of new music I'm

  body: "nope, not from the band.  it was passed on to me from another designer -
    referencing a project i'm working on.  but she can't remember where she found
    it.  so unfortunately, it hasn't been modified...   It's a puzzle!\r\n\r\nI've
    checked out the ball terminals link - thanks!!"
