body: "Hi, I work for an architects firm regenerating the Royal Festival Hall on London's
  Southbank. This is an iconic modernist building, built for London\u2019s 1951 great
  exhibition:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/about-southbank-centre/transforming-southbank\r\n\r\nWe
  are currently renovating the 1950's auditorium and need to replace some of the row
  numbers. I'm assuming this is probably some classic font and would love to be true
  to it's origins. I only have a D so far but will post the rest later this week (once
  the builders have torn them from the floor! ... sorry... gently pried)\r\n\r\nany
  help very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nSam\r\n"

  body: Brilliant guys, thank you! here are 11 more letters. The G is similar to the
    regular linotype cut, but the weight is wrong, also the H has differences. any
    more ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11 more letters_5502.jpg]

  body: definitely a clarendon derivative... reminds me of the lettering used on tiles
    for street names in the hampstead area... the cut is rough (see A and C), so could
    have been hand formed... oh, and the H is upside down :-)

  body: "There is certainly a roughness to them. \r\n\r\nIn terms of fabrication,
    that's actually generated a lot of debate here. In section the discs have a sandwiched
    construction of white/brown/white we think that they're made of formica. Anyway
    that's how we plan on reproducing the missing ones.\r\n\r\nOne thought has occurred
    to me. On the myfonts site it says that Clarendon was produced in 1953. That's
    2 years after the Royal Festival Hall was opened! The architecture firm responsible
    for the interior of the RFH was German, as were the creators of Clarendon. Could
    this be an early proto version of the font? does anyone know the circumstances
    of the font's creation? "

  body: "ah I've just wikipedia'd it...\r\n\r\ncreated in England by Robert Besley
    for the Fann Street Foundry in 1845. Besley went as far as trying to patent the
    typeface, though this failed. The original matrices and punches remained at Stephenson
    Blake and latterly at the Type Museum, London. They were marketed by Stephenson
    Blake as Consort, though some additional weights (a bold and italics) were cut
    in 1950s\r\n\r\nIt was named after the Clarendon Press in Oxford. The typeface
    was reworked by the Monotype foundry in 1935. It was revised by Hermann Eidenbenz
    in 1953.\r\n\r\ncould still be a proto version of the bold cut"

  body: Tim is right about the way these were made. Now you have just to find some
    of the original equipment & someone to operate it. I have an aquaintance who used
    to do this type of work in the seventies and early eighties, but he has switched
    to restoring piano's.

  body: That's what we thought originally except the middle layer is brown not black,
    and the letter is flush with the surface. We think it's formica - multiple layers
    of white and kraft paper plasticized by laminating together in resin under huge
    heat and pressure. the top layers (maybe 20 sheets) would have the letter printed
    on them. this might become distorted under the huge pressures involved. we experimented
    with routed and laser etched plastics but couldn't find one durable enough to
    withstand being repeatedly trodden on. we could easily be wrong though.
