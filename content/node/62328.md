  your gentle but honest critiques, so I will try to be brief.\r\n\r\nThe attached
  image represents my latest attempt to design a business card for my wife, who is
  a real estate agent. I wanted her card to be direct and to the point (like she is),
  but also clean, polished, and professional in appearance. The logo on the reverse
  of the card is meant to be the letter \"C\" with (I hope) the image of a stylized
  house in the negative space adjacent. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I don't think it's that
  bad, certainly in comparison to other real estate business cards I've seen, but
  not bad is not the same thing as good.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think? Do I have something
  here, or should I throw it on the digital bonfire and start anew?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SuperNewBizCard4_3605.png]"

    easily. I'd go back to the drawing board on that. \r\n\r\nThe periods everywhere
    don't let the text flow well. A lot of new slogans and ads try to be simple. and
    brief. and to the point. but they end up reading rather stilted and jarring. Why
    not put commas after \"Real Estate\" in both instances. Then it would read as
    a complete sentence, make more sense, and flow better. To make it even simpler,
    you could make the first instance one complete sentence: \"Real Estate doesn't
    have to hurt.\"\r\n\r\nI don't like the band of color on either side. It's unnecessary,
    and especially for a card trying to exude simplicity, it would be better without
    it. \r\n\r\npenn"

    how many people feel as they contemplate a real-estate transaction. <em>I'm afraid

    What your wife promises is to relieve that fear for them. \r\n\r\nA minimalist
    design can betray a fear of looking silly. Good visual marketing says <em>Here's
    how I'll make things better for you</em>, not <em>See how sophisticated I am.</em>\r\n\r\nOne
    thing that <em>will</em> make your wife look silly is if the printer accidentally
    cuts off part of her phone number. Your printer will need need at least 1/8 inch
    margin between any type and the the edge of the card.\r\n\r\n<strong>A brief digression

    (fora?). As a (painfully) novice designer, it is incredibly valuable to have a
    tool such Typophile available.\r\n\r\nOk, so enough gratuitous sucking up.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a compilation of the most recent versions of my wife's business card. As you
    can see, the versions are numbered 1-6, #1 being the version favored by Mr. Dean.
    Of these six, which one shows the most promise- still #1, or another one? (I think
    I like #4 or #5, myself.)\r\n\r\nA bit more information about the requirements
    for the design of the business card: My wife works for a real estate brokerage
    called \"Red Door Realty\", but she doesn't want to use the firm's logo on her
    card (because that logo is a clip art abomination). I have tried to design a personal
    mark for my wife to be used instead of the Red Door logo, but I'm not sure that
    I'm happy with any that I've come up with. \r\n\r\nThe red used on the card is
    meant to refer to Red Door Realty, but also to red brick, and I also thought it
    seemed serious but, at the same time, eye-catching. \r\n\r\nAnyway, here it all
    is.\r\n\r\nThanks-[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MegaCard_5661.png]"

  body: "Additional tweaks (#1) \u2014 If you're going minimalist, it's the details
    that really make it snap.\r\n\r\n1. Lowercase t and f so they don't blend into
    the numbers so much.\r\n\r\n2. It's conventional to use a \"thin space\" (about
    the width of a lowercase i, maybe less, just a little smaller than a normal space)
    when separating groups of digits in a telephone number. The spacing after the
    t and f should be normal. I usually eye-ball it. \r\n\r\n3. Go full-on international:
    +1 864 908 7498 (+1 = your country code)\r\n\r\n4. Kern the numbers very carefully.\r\n\r\n5.
    What font are you using? I'd recommend one with small caps (SC) so you can use
    them for her degree. Using old style figures (OSF) for the tel/fax is a tough
    call. If you need to buy a font to do it, I wouldn't bother, but if you're willing
    to shell out a grand, go for [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/090204000.html|Futura
    Serie]]. Not only does it have a great range of weights, it is one of few sans
    with a complete set of SC and OSF. You could use it for all of the additional
    materials. Additionally, it has a very geometric look to it which I consider appropriate
    to the context. As her initials are CH, the C would great.\r\n\r\n6. I can't tell
    if you dropped the weight on the | between the numbers or not. I would.\r\n\r\n7.
    Try dropping the weight or size (-1 pt) of the . in a web/email.\r\n\r\n8. Why
    did you choose bottom right, flush right?\r\n\r\n9. Did you consciously choose
    to not include the web address? I didn't notice it at first as I simply gleaned
    it from the email address. I would leave it as is (and I'm going to steal that

  body: "+Mr. Eliason- Your point about the CH logo is well taken. I agree that having
    a logo on the card that does not refer to the name of the brokerage is confusing.
    As you say, I can save some of those logo ideas for another time. \r\n\r\nRegarding
    the color, well, I'm open to experimentation. I'll try to find a truer brick color.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mr.
    Dean- I have taken your advice about the @'s and have adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo
    address your second post: Yeah, the thing I'm learning about minimalism is that,
    for the design to be successful, every element must be considered with care. Which
    is why simple design is more challenging for me, and probably why it is so much
    more appealing\r\n\r\n1, 2, & 4. I changed t & f to lowercase, and reduced the
    space between clusters of numbers. I'm working on the kerning, which is a trial-and-error
    process for me.\r\n\r\n3. I'll experiment with adding the country prefix to the
    phone numbers, though I'm not sure that it's a necessary element right now.\r\n\r\n5.
    The font is Vegur, which I probably found by scouring the interwebs for free,
    legal, fairly well-designed fonts. I'll try to find a sans font with small caps
    and hanging numerals. As you have guessed, money is limited right now (example:
    the cards were designed in Inkscape on a 7-year-old machine running Linux), but,
    yeah, the typeface you mentioned is pretty great.\r\n\r\n6. I did drop the weight
    on the | on one version of the business card, but apparently not on the versions
    posted. But, yes, it does make a difference.\r\n\r\n7. I will give this a try.
    \r\n\r\n8. Hmm, this is an interesting question. I'm not entirely sure I have
    a real answer. I know that I really liked the idea of balancing the card between
    a nice, comfortable area of white space and tight, compact areas of information.
    I knew I wanted the contact info at the bottom, and I wanted the characters to
    be aligned on the right. Honestly, I think I just wanted to make a card that was
    simple, clean, and direct, and completely unlike most real estate business cards
    I'd seen. The fact that the card doesn't feature a photo of my wife is pretty
    unusual, for example.\r\n\r\n9. I thought it was redundant to list the web address
    on the card, and I also wanted to eliminate unnecessary information to make the
    contact area more compact. I'd be pleased if you stole the idea, especially since
    I probably stole it from someone else myself.\r\n\r\nI'll work some more and post
    my next revision if you folks are interesting in taking a look.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n\r\n"
