body: "While browsing old type catalogs on Google Books, I ran across a friendly,
  light Arts & Crafts face in the De Vinne catalog (ca. 1900, I looked at several
  iterations), although it appears to have originated with ATF. This face went by
  the name of Cushing, but as you can see, it bears little to no resemblance to the
  semi-condensed typeface that uses that name in the catalogs of Adobe, Berthold,
  EF, ITC, etc. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cushing_6271.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  latter-day Cushing is clearly a descendant of Cushing Old Style, as shown in the
  1894 Norwood Press catalog (won't bother you with that one). \r\n\r\nA more detailed
  showing of the Cushing I'm after is available on pp. 2-8 of the 1897 De Vinne catalog,
  \"Old Faces of Roman and Medieval Types Lately Added to the De Vinne Press\": \r\n[[http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=awFC5idamkQC&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&pg=GBS.PA7]]\r\n(Not
  sure if that link will work, but you can look it up)\r\n\r\nMy question is whether
  this font and its italic companion have been digitized, and if so, what is the modern
  face called?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Update:  I see from an 1898 ATF catalog that the version I'm interested in
    is called Cushing Monotone (as opposed to Cushing Old Style, which, ironically,
    is the modern version).  Still interested in whether there is a modern digitized
    version masquerading under some other name.\r\n"
