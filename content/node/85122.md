  body: "\"Chef\" ought to be the focal point of the logo, but currently it's overpowered
    by the decorative ornament, and its position at the end of the line puts it in
    the least prominent position. \r\n\r\nI'd suggest trying variations where \"chef\"
    is larger and on a line of it's own. Might try making \"the\" a lot less prominent,
    too.\r\n\r\nThe heart shape is clever, but I\"m not quite sure how it fits in
    with the concept of \"tutored\". "

  body: ' I will definitely take your suggestions and make chef larger. I was trying
    to go for an abstract mustache with the decorative ornament. Here''s a thought,
    do you think I could do without the decorative ornament? and just make chef the
    focal point of the mark? My reasoning for adding the heart is because good chefs
    like what they do but great chefs love what they do. Maybe I should add a tagline
    to communicate that? Part of the brief was that the name of the restaurant couldn''t
    be changed since the restaurant already has established equity in the name. '

  body: "> I was trying to go for an abstract mustache\r\n\r\nOkay, now I see it.\r\n\r\nBut
    is a fancy moustache something that people associate with student chefs, or with
    their tutors?  Maybe others would feel differently, but to me it just doesn't
    seem like the most appropriate graphic reference. \r\n\r\nMaybe something like
    a chef's hat might communicate the idea better. Chef's hats sometimes have the
    restaurant name printed on them, so maybe you could make a logo consisting of
    the hat with the name on it. Or maybe 2 overlapping chef's hats, one larger than
    the other, to give the idea of a teacher and a student chef. Not sure if these
    are good ideas or not, they're just some thoughts off the top of my head."

  body: Is the name a play on 'the pampered chef'?  I get the idea of the heart, but
    I don't know that it connects.  I think of restaurants in terms of my experience
    there, not the motivation of the staff.  The heart says to me that it is a romantic
    destination, great for Valentine's day.  What do you want people to expect before
    they come?  Who is the audience?  What is the best thing about eating there?  The
    answers to those questions should guide your brainstorming and ideation.

  body: "James I think you make a great point, the fancy mustache is associated with
    their tutors, that never crossed my mind but it makes sense, it's not an appropriate
    reference. All of your thoughts are good, I'll take them into consideration no
    doubt.\r\n\r\nLuma I don't believe it is, the name was chosen by students, (probably
    why it isn't the greatest thing to work with) but nonetheless it brings up some
    interesting challenges to try and overcome. The audience is guests with a sophisticated
    palate, so food enthusiasts who aren't amateurs if you will. The best thing about
    eating there besides the food is the price of the food for the quality of food
    one gets. I don't want Valentine's day so maybe I should probably just scrap the
    heart idea and keep the custom lettering. \r\n\r\nThanks for all of your constructive
    criticism, it definitely pointed me towards a more viable solution."

  body: "What about this?? The triangle is made of three strands which reinforce :
    the environment, and the type of food they serve. Which is echoed in the tagline.
    each strand would consist of a separate color.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttc_4083.jpg]"

  body: "While abstract logos can work sometimes, it might be better if the graphic
    related more directly to the subject. \r\n\r\nAnd keep in mind that clients sometimes
    change tag lines. If the tag line becomes 2 words or 4 words next year, your connection
    to the 3 strands is lost. I would hesitate to design a logo around the tag line.\r\n\r\nAlso
    the slant of \"tutored\" and \"chef\" are slightly different; I'd suggest that
    they both have the same angle. (Or if you want them to be different, make the
    difference more pronounced so it looks deliberate.)"

    etc.) with your latest version, but I see from your profile that you're a student.
    I'll give you the best advice I received while I was a student: A logo is complete
    when there's nothing left to take away, and the message is still clearly in tact.
    \r\n\r\nIn other words, adding more stuff <strong>very rarely</strong> helps.
    \r\n\r\nRefine your graphics to speak to your audience. What you've presented
    so far shows me that you're unclear on what you want to say to this audience.
    Remember -- you're using graphics to convey an invitation to dinner guests. Take
    some time to explore restaurant logos, and while you're looking, ask yourself
    what the logo is saying to you about the restaurant it represents. How is each
    logo achieving its message? Texture? Shape? Color? Simplicity? Style?\r\n\r\nThat's
    a much better place to develop your concept than trying to abstractly illustrate
    buzz words. Once your concept is refined, then start sketching. "
