  20&#34; contest. In reading the fine print for entries: &#34;You may enter a 35mm
  slide, or a Macintosh .eps file along with the hard copy of the logo. Be sure to
  include any logo fonts on the disk, so the logo can print properly.&#34; <BR> <BR>Do
  the rest of you read that as I do? I read it as: &#34;Send us all the fonts associated
  with your logo.&#34; Although, it could be they are specifically talking about a
  font that contains the logo. In any case, turning the fonts to outline in an eps
  file would eliminate the problem.'

    for 10 years.

    the line, &#34;change all of your type to outlines&#34;.

    they even want an eps. Why not a high quality GIF or JPEG, just thinking out-load.

  body: The .eps format works well with QuarkXPress &#40;and InDesign and PageMaker&#41;,
    which I expect they&#39;re using for production. GIFs and JPEGs do not provide
    the scaling flexibility that a vector format does. I would think a PDF file would
    be a smarter, and legal, workflow. <BR> <BR>My point had more to do with a rather
    large organization asking designers to violate their type licenses, and most probably
    will without thinking about it. We do love to see our names in lights <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: But Bill why would you ask for final art before picking a winner. They just
    need to have a mention that if you win you must provide camera ready artwork.
    Sounds like a classic cart before the horse. Maybe the rules are really old and
    haven&#39;t been updated in a long time.

  body: My guess is, that they do these award books on the cheap. It takes less time
    and effort to produce if all the entries come in with camera-ready artwork. That
    way, the only winners you need to contact are people who provided files that were
    not adequately pre-flighted.

    <BR>In your opinion, what percentage of  <BR>corporate identity logos are created
    in raster, and what  <BR>percentage in vector? <BR>

  body: '&#62;&#62;Why not a high quality GIF or JPEG <BR> <BR>OK, I don&#39;t want
    to spar either, and I agree that raster works better than vector in some cases,
    but I don&#39;t think there is such a thing as a high quality gif or jpeg. <BR>&#40;Well
    maybe that&#39;s an over-simplification, but you would need quite specific circumstances
    for either of these to provide as good quality as tif of png, and they could not
    provide better quality&#41;. <BR>The problems are that gif is an 8 bit format
    which means that you can only have 256 colours in your image. That can be OK for
    some logos, but in general, the kind of logo that would be OK as a gif would be
    better as a vector. <BR>The problem with jpgs is the compression thing - you have
    no control over the mess that the compression algorithm makes of your work. <BR>
    <BR>Where quality is the criteria, use tifs, unless you need alpha channel transparency,
    when you should use pngs. <BR> <BR>===== <BR>I&#39;ve just re-read all that, and
    it sounds dictatorial - that&#39;s not how it was intended. I&#39;m not claiming
    to be the world&#39;s leading authority on this, just offering my opinion.'
