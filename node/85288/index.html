  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone, I&rsquo;m posting a sample of a font I&rsquo;ve been working on for the last few month now. I&rsquo;m aiming to do a modern sans-serif with a bit more friendliness than the usual spurless fonts. My goal is to design a text version and a condensed version with light/regular/bold/black, with italics, so 16 fonts in total.</p>
<p>Even though this is still a bit early stage, I&rsquo;d be quite interested to know what you think about the general design of the font. I live in Perth, Australia, and there&rsquo;s not many font designers around as far as I know, so thanks to Typophile, I should be able to finally get some constructive feedbacks :)</p>
<p>I started this font design by looking at fonts like DAX or AKKO. I tried to keep the shapes very simple and not too rounded to stay modern, but at the same time, not too square to keep the friendliness in. It is quite a low contrast for a text font, but I think that the open shapes and a largish width should be balancing this.</p>
<p>In the attached sample (it&rsquo;s the bold by the way), some glyphs are grey because I only added them to give a general idea of what I want to do, but I&rsquo;m not happy enough to consider them as part of the family yet. I really struggle with few letter, mostly lowercase like the y, a, g, or x. The capitals are a more recent work and I think doesn&rsquo;t have as much character as I want it to have yet, except for some letters like the A, R and P that I&rsquo;m quite happy with for now.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your comments.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I recently did some extended test prints, and I think my bold is not bold enough. also, I might have make it a tiny bit too big because testing at 12pt was looking bigger than most fonts. So I&rsquo;m back to the drawing board to increase the weight of each glyph and I surely will edit the shape of some because I think I might have missed some nice opportunities with letters like v, w, x, y and z.
I&rsquo;ll also work on a new spacing, I feel like it needs to be a bit increased in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure to upload some of the updates. Any thought anyone?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m liking it! A few coments: The angle of the top of the stem of <em>r, n, m</em> makes it look abraded. The tail of <em>l</em> is too long for my liking. Both <em>S</em> and <em>s</em> look rotated counterclockwise. Straighten a bit the lower part of the stem of <em>a</em>. The diagonal upper stroke of <em>k</em> ends in an uncommon angle. Why hasn&rsquo;t the <em>z</em> any angled strokes?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, I really like this. Sort of looks like a cross between Aller and Officina.</p>
<p>Not too sure I&rsquo;m a fan of the tops of the M and N. Perhaps try a flat corner? Also the g looks to be leaning to the right because of the shape of the tail. I&rsquo;m not sure this would look good, but I think a tighter curve might help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everyone for commenting and for the kind words. In general, I agree with the idea that I have some problem with these angled stems and terminals. I still have to find a solid system to get the consistency right. What bothers me the most is that I tend to use the angled top a little bit too systematically, and I&rsquo;m testing to see if I like having some flat tops or different solutions to keep these angles. You can also see some example of my recent tests on this thread (sorry, it&rsquo;s in french but you&rsquo;ll get the idea with the images) : <a href="http://www.typographe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=13783#p13783">http://www.typographe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=13783#p13783</a></p>
<p>Nothing has proven to be completely successful so far, but I will post the results when I feel that I have found a good solution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start experimenting with some weights soon, and maybe that&rsquo;ll bring some answers.</p>
