  body: "However, if you are looking for something that might be similar, I could
    suggest Canada Type's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/apricot/\"
    target=\"new\">'Apricot'</a>, which is a vertical monoline script with many alternate
    characters and ligatures. (See the sample from the Script Font ID Guide at http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg12.html).
    If you thickened the strokes, I think you could make a rough approximation of
    your sample using a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    of a website.
