  body: "Can't find a match and really doubt there's one actually. Gatorade owns Propel
    and use [[http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081101164312AABRpUF|custom-made
    fonts]]. As the 2 logos look blatantly connected, we could easily imagine Propel
    is also a custom job. Previous logo version could give some track though.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PropelZeroLogo_5970.png]\r\nFor
    what it's worth, if I had to reproduce it, I'd probably start with one among [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica|Helvetica]]
    (Black Condensed or any of the Compressed)/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/inserat|Inserat]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/impact|Impact]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/smart-sans|Smart
    Sans]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/plakette|Plakette]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/folio|Folio]]
    Condensed Bold/[[http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/loft|Loft]], shear
    it and rework all counters \"\xE0-la-[[http://typophile.com/node/102242|Inverserif]]\".\r\nAnd
    if you only need this logo as vector, it is freely available to download [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/propel-fitness-water|here]]."
