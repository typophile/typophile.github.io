  body: You mean the sort Eric Gill wore? Apparently they obviate the need for underwear.

    the ink &#40;like a chef or cook&#39;s hat keeps their hair out of the food&#41;.
    Of course, any ol hat will do. And you would really have to be a bit of a pretentious
    dork to wear one.'

  body: Simon <BR> <BR>Well, you suckered me on that one. But I am not so certain
    that the hat Gill wore was a printer&#39;s hat so to speak. Sort of looks like
    one, but I just can&#39;t imagine Gill putting a piece of folded waste paper on
    his head. I&#39;ve always thought it was some odd &#34;foreign&#34; taste &#40;mid-eastern
    or something&#41; in a hat that he picked up along the way. Despite the no underwear
    bit and all the rest, just doesn&#39;t seem quite his class.

  body: these hats are brilliant! Just made one following the Briarpress instructions.
    I&#39;ll be teaching at a workshop next week, maybe I should force the students
    to make and wear these things. <BR>Really, should I?
