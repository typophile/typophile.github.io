body: I was invited to attend a lecture here in Pittsburgh, PA where Doyald Young
  is the guest speaker. I have read about a new book he has been working on and understand
  that it is in print. Anyone know where I can get a copy or does anyone have any
  more information.

  body: Doyald is on a tour, sponsored by Smart Papers, which published The Art of
    the Letter. <BR>The Art of the Letter is a condensed summary <BR>of Fonts &amp;
    Logos and Logotypes &amp; Letterforms. Doyald also sprinkled in some <BR>new material.
    <BR>Seeing him speak in person, here in LA, was <BR>a treat, and the Art of the
    Letter is a nice keepsake. <BR> <BR>So go see him!

  body: You&#39;ll get The Art of the Letter free as part of attending the lecture.  &#40;Since
    SmartPapers is publishing it as part of the tour, I don&#39;t believe you it&#39;s
    available for sale otherwise.&#41;  You&#39;ll also be able to purchase Doyald&#39;s
    other books at the lecture; or at least that was true here in Austin.

  body: I tried that already. In fact, when I saw the announcement oh so many months
    ago, I called instantly. They told me that I should talk to my local AIGA chapter.
    Sadly our local chapter isn&#39;t the most active. I wrote to both our PR and
    secretary with no reply. --- Anyone that does have better luck with contacting
    SmartPapers should let us know what you said. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: a response from Smart Papers. <BR> <BR>&#34;The piece is only being distributed
    at the Doyald Young event. The two <BR>go hand-in-hand. They are welcome to contact
    a SMART Sales Rep in their <BR>area and see if an event can be scheduled.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Tiffany, maybe if you went to Doyald&#39;s site and emailed him directly
    ... <BR>perhaps he&#39;d like to donate some samples to the TypeCon auction. At
    the very least, <BR>Smart Papers would be wise to look into <BR>TypeCon. <BR>
