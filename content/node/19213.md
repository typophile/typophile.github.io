    comes to mind is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-jellybaby/\">ITC
    Jellybaby</a>.The lower csae 'i' is the same height as the uppercase letters,
    so that works too. I'm still looking for a better match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    could also be used this way, though the stems are not quite as curved. Still looking...\r\n\r\n-
