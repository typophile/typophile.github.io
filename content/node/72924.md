  body: "Mark: Are you using Mac or Windows?\r\n\r\nPopular wisdom seems to suggest
    the Mac version is much less stable than the Windows version. I run FL for Windows
    for any serious work, even if it means doing it under a VM on Mac.\r\n\r\nT"

    under Windows Vista 64-bit).  :-)\r\n\r\nSeriously, I have a clean, perfect complete
    system installation in an image (created with TrueImage). About each two months
    I do a complete system reinstall using this image. It take about 15 minutes and
    keeps Windows under control. This may be the reason FontLab in running OK with
    me."

    with it long enough I have a feeling for avoiding that.\r\nSo I never drag a guide
    onto a glyph composed of composites, for instance."

    are from users of FL 4.6, now that was a bundle o' bugs."

    Mac as well 10.4.11.  FL5 has occasional freak-outs. SAVE OFTEN! FontLab is one
    of the rare apps that give me the spinning beach ball. The only worse ones are
    anything in the Microsoft suite. Otherwise, my Mac is as steady and solid as can
    be.\r\n\r\nand I never switch between kinds of classes via the pop-up. Also, if
    you get a bunch of random diagonal lines drawn courtesy of FontLab demons, undo
    twice and relaunch FontLab.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: The worst bug I ever experienced was in a version of Quark, where if you moved
    your cursor just a lit little bit off the top of a pull-down menu, you got the
    bomb. Remember the bomb? -- compared to which the spinning beach ball is a smarmy
    euphemism.

  body: I use Windows 7 and I still manage to crash thrice a week. I recently had
    to do a fresh OS install and it crashes at the same frequency. It depends what
    I'm working on. If I'm arrow key tapping points, it's unlikely to crash. If I'm
    messing with the mask layer, composites, paste special, classes or dragging and
    dropping glyphs, I'm more likely to crash it. The current version of FLS doesn't
    crash as predictably as older versions did. I used to have to do certain things
    to avoid crashes. But now it's different. I can do something to make it crash,
    load the same font, do exactly the same thing again and it won't crash.
