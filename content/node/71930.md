  it, the problem is next: when I write with it the height of one line is very very
  long, just to be sure you understand here are some pics of it [of course the problem
  is same in Illustrator] ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/problem1_5565.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/problem1selected_3665.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy
  is that happening?\r\n\r\nI work with FontLab 5.0.4 :)"

  body: "I don't know, I've tried setting much higher UPM size [it should be 2048],
    up to 3000 or 4000 but it doesn't work :/ But also I would like to ask if the
    UPM size sould be 2000 if my caps height is 2000 or it should be much higher and
    how much? As the 'tallest' character or?\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply"

  body: I think this topic was addressed here once, but I'm not sure where or how
    to find it. Where I work there are a few fonts that do this. They were fine while
    we were still using Freehand, but after switching to Illustrator things behaved
    differently.

  body: Don't you have a glyph much taller than others? It may be a regular glyph
    with a lost vector above or bellow it.

  body: Check your Ascender and Descender values and double check that you don't have
    any stray elements that might be auto generating such an extreme default auto
    leading value. I like working with UPM at 2000 and depending on the type, Caps
    height somewhere around 1200-1600 with Ascenders/Descenders and x height set accordingly.
