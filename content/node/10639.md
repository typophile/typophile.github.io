  recomendations from other typophiles...  <BR>But the thing is that I don&#39;t have
  a f&#42;ckin&#39; clue where to begin!! <BR> <BR>Can someone give some rookie-tutorials
  or just some hints to get me started ? <BR> <BR>I would really like to make my own

    or Fontscan. <BR>Clean up in Illustrator or Freehand. <BR>Copy and paste into
    Fontlab. <BR>Work on shapes some more. <BR>Space. <BR>Kern. <BR>Read the manual.

  body: O.K. lots of people are going to disagree with me now, but anyway....  <BR>  <BR>I
    think a fundamental understanding of writing is needed before one can begin to
    design typefaces. Writing, whether with a calligraphic pen or other tools help
    establishing a kinesthetic understanding, or, a feel for proportions and flow.
    Writing with a broad-edge pen will help you to appreciate the principles behind
    thick-thin transitions, which is essential for designing serifed text faces. A
    good writing manual would certainly help. Edward Johnston&#39;s <i>Writing and
    illuminating, and lettering</i> might be a good place to start, or Gerrit Noordzij&#39;s
    <i>Stoke of the pen</i>, or other good calligraphy books. After getting to grips
    with the principles of writing, lettering could follow. Lettering could be seen
    as a liberation from writing, to free oneself from the bounds of the writing instrument,
    but still retaining a strong tie with the fundamental principles of writing. Experimentations
    and explorations could then follow. <BR>  <BR>FontLab is a very sophisticated
    piece of software for making cutting-edge digital faces, but as a design tool
    it&#39;s a bit counter-intuitive. I prefer working out ideas on paper first, scan
    it and take it from there.  <BR>  <BR>Of course I haven&#39;t talked about spacing
    and kerning yet! I have no idea... I just do it by eye. But I think I did learn
    a lot about spacing from doing calligraphy &#40;again, I think it&#39;s a kinesthetic
    thing&#41; and rubbing down Letraset! Oh yeah, look at Walter Tracy&#39;s <i>Letters
    of Credit</i>. Also <i>Twentieth century type designers</i> by Sebastian Carter
    will give you a lot of insights about how different type designers work and give
    you lots of inspiration!  <BR>  <BR>Hope this helps. Gook luck!

    kind of typefaces are out there.. and then start creating something that fit with

  body: My recommendation is to start with a Serif rather than a Sans. To understand
    better the shapes and counters forms. Its not because they &#40;Sans&#41; lacking
    of contrast that they are more easy to design. You will learn more with Serif
    fonts.

  body: Keith, one day I will write a treatise as to exactly why chirography is not
    only unnecessary, but in fact <i>detrimental</i>. Liberate yourself now - don&#39;t
    wait for lettering - lettering in fact shares chirography&#39;s incapacity to
    elaborate on typographic <i>spacing</i>. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    some faces based on sketches in his doodle-book, <BR>and some were started and
    finished all on the computer. <BR>i think &#40;and consider the source here&#41;

  body: '<i>Adding to my first post I would like to state that the more finished your
    drawings are from the start are the easier your life will be when you import them
    to a digital format.</i> <BR> <BR>This depends on how you intend to &#39;import&#39;
    them to a digital format. I gave up on scanners several years ago, when I discovered
    that even quite expensive ones introduce distortions by compressing or expanding
    in one direction. These days, if I draw on paper at all, I only make rough drawings
    to get the shape down: then I prop the drawing beside my screen and use it as
    a visual guide to create the shape on the computer. It was only after I had been
    doing this for a couple of years that I read a comment by Hermann Zapf regarding
    the kind of drawings he prepared for a manual punchcutter, as contrasted with
    those prepared for industrial production. The drawings for industrial production
    needed to be very clean and precise, because the individual operating the pantograph,
    camera, Ikarus tablet or scanner &#40;depending on the era&#41; was neither qualified
    nor expected to <i>interpret</i> the design, only to reproduce it as exactly as
    possible. A good punchcutter, however, is an expert interpreter: able to take
    a designer&#39;s quite rough drawing and create a workable typeface from it, glyph
    by glyph, on the end of little pieces of steel. As a result, Zapf says his drawings
    for the brilliant punchcutter August Rosenberger, with whom he worked for many
    years, were much rougher than he needed to produce for mechanical production.
    I believe the same is true in digital type design, especially when one is making
    one&#39;s own outlines: it is not necessary to produce perfect drawings if one
    develops the ability to interpret rough drawings directly with the computer tools.'

  body: John, I design most of everything directly on screen generally without any
    sources on paper. <BR> <BR>But, my point is sometimes, some style can&#39;t be
    achieved directly on screen, you will lost too much time. I refer to &#34;Script&#34;
    forms who imitate writing and so on, generally all fancy lettering stuff. Just
    try to draw directly on screen something like Zapfino, ex Ponto, Sanvito, Caflish
    Script... <BR> <BR>The best, is to know perfectly the limitations of the tools
    you use &#40;because you know them&#41;, and use the most adapted to your whishes
    rather than trying to do something with a tool who make your life more complicate.
    <BR> <BR>To comeback to non experienced designers. Generally is more easy to separate

    a very good point. In fact it&#39;s a waste of time. For example, when you&#39;re
    drawing an italic, there&#39;s no use normalizing the angles on paper. <BR> <BR>On
    the other hand, certain types of designs &#40;like highly irregular ones&#41;
    might benefit from &#34;finished&#34; drawings. <BR> <BR>I use paper myself, but
    really only because drawing software isn&#39;t very good &#40;yet&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: All of the above seems true. There are good arguments for all these points.
    Everyone finds their own way that works best for them.  <BR> <BR>I think, as a
    beginner, drawing has more freedom and can help to identify clear objectives about
    what one may want out their design. Experienced designers might be able to draw
    directly on the computer because they know where points should land after having
    placed thousands of them. The beginner does not have this in their arsenal yet.
    So I still see scanning as a good way to start even if it is necessary to interpret
    these to accommodate for scanner distortion.  <BR> <BR>Is is necessary to draw
    every character perfectly before moving to the computer? No. But but defining
    clear characteristics of your design does seem important to me. After these characteristics,
    such as a serif for example, are discovered, defined, whatever it is easy to copy
    and paste these in the computer from glyph to glyph. But do not do this for everything.
    You don&#39;t want your &#34;m&#34; to be two &#34;n&#34;s stuck together. <BR>
    <BR>Henriko, however you start, start with the words &#34;hamburefonts&#34; or
    &#34;handgloves&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Start with lowercase then move to the uppercase.
