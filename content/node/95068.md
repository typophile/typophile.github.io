  a large variety of countries. I had planned to use Lubalin Graph Bold Condensed
  as a headline font in my game. As I understand it, this only supports Latin characters.
  Can anyone explain what my options are in this case? Is it possible/ feasible to
  make custom characters for the languages I require? (WGL would probably be enough
  for me). \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any advice."

    be worth contacting Monotype to see what is possible. They may already have an
    expanded character set for this font that they can add to the web font version."
