body: "I am adding polytonic Greek to a font family and have a question concerning
  alternate glyphs. After looking at numerous examples there doesn't appear to be
  a standard for the iota diacritic glyphs especially for small caps versions. Here
  is what I have designed so far \u2014 please ignore spacing, etc. as this is still
  a work in progress.  The base glyph is uni1F8A with/without hanging diacritics,
  then an alternate with a regular iota instead of the iota diacritic, then a small
  cap uni1F8A, then a cap/small cap of it, last a small cap with a reduced iota diacritic.
  My question is do I need all these and have I forgotten any variations such as cap/small
  cap hanging diacritic? I don't want to go overboard, but as long as I am doing it
  I feel everything necessary should be included.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_shot_4742.png]"

    from that, that the \u201Ccap with small cap\u201D (titlecase) version of these
    characters would also be unnecessary.\r\nSave yourself a lot of work, omit accented
    small caps!\r\nAFAIK, only Slimbach has created such.\r\nBut perhaps John Hudson
    has had a go at it.\r\nThis was discussed at Typophile, but at the moment it\u2019s
    impossible to \uFB01nd the thread, due to search engine problems."

  body: "Thanks for your input Nick. \r\nI guess I passed \"overboard\" a while back
    since the accented small caps are already designed in the various weights for
    'smcp' and 'c2sc', though not yet the italic. It wasn't that hard to create them
    and I did decide to do accented small caps after looking at Arno Pro. My biggest
    concern is writing the feature code correctly. I will have to think about taking
    them out since I'm so far along. I admit I do tend to overdo projects and then
    go for the easier solution. Hate to toss them out though.\r\n"

    uncial text transcription. With regard to the adscript iota, there is precedence
    in <a href="http://tiro.com/John/apollonius.gif">renaissance typography</a> for
    a form slightly shorter than the smallcap height (in the image, see the second
    word of the uncial text). '

    that a signi\uFB01cant market?\r\nGiven the number of free academic Greek fonts
    available, unless your typeface has a corporate backer, is there any reason to
    put so much work into it?"

  body: "Thanks for everyone's advice. Seriously needed and helpful.\r\n\r\nI think
    I will go ahead and keep the accented small caps for this font family since the
    upright ones are done anyway. I spent about a week writing/altering various scripts
    to make them so finishing the italic won't be that much more work. \r\n\r\nSince
    getting rich and famous from type design is never going to be an option I'm not
    concerned about the market. This may be the only font I do this for though. I'm
    spending a lot of time updating my existing fonts to otf (almost all production
    work). Feels like I'm living in the past and I'm dying to design some new things.\r\n\r\nThe
    biggest problem I have now is writing the feature code and in looking at other
    faces (most notably Hypatia Sans) not having accented small caps doesn't seem
    to make that much easier. In any case I will be back with more questions as this
    matures.\r\n\r\n"
