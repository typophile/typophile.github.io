  body: "I have this font under the name of 'Lender', as part of the Expresiv Ornate
    font collection from 1994. It was a font digitized by NovelFonts, who has since
    gone out of business, as far as I know. I have never identified what the original
    name of the typeface was. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Well, as Novelfonts have gone out of business they don't have an active presence
    on the internet, so I guess you can only find references to it in old NovelFonts
    stuff.
