body: "Hey people, \r\n\r\nIs there any reason (technicalities wise) not to make glyphs
  overlap (negative kerning/spacing) in a script-like situation (Italic SwashCap with
  a lowercase italic). I mean, I've seen prints where the overlapping part becomes
  white, but I'd think you need overlapping parts in a script font, so it should be
  possible right?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pictur6_4546.png]"

  body: 'this should not be a problem with apps that send an outline font to the OS''s
    rendering and get a bitmap back to send to the screen or to print. there, bitmaps
    are combined so no holes appear. if an app goes from font to outline, like illustrator
    allows, sometimes holes might appear. '

  body: This is a path direction thing, as far as I know. If two overlapping paths
    have paths in opposite directions, the overlap knocks out. But that's an old PostScript
    thing. I assume it affects TrueType paths also, but do not know for sure.

  body: "Here is what I get from the <a href=\"http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF\"><strong>Adobe
    Type 1 Font Format</strong></a> spec.\r\n\r\n<cite>If two filled subpaths in a
    character overlap, there may be no problem when the character is filled. However,
    a Type 1 font program can also be stroked along its outline when the user changes
    the PaintType entry in the font dictionary to 2. In this case, overlapping subpaths
    will be visible in the output; this yields undesirable visual results in outlined
    characters. Always construct the character paths with outlined output in mind.</cite>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overlapping_5993.png]\r\nI
    don't know who uses stroked characters but let me tell you that in mathematical
    typesetting, if pieces of a large mathematical symbol do not overlap, the result
    may look like crap on screen, which I find that quite annoying. And I wonder,
    is it is possible at all to make a script font that could be stroked?"

  body: What a confusing thread. Isn't there a difference between overlaps within
    the definitions of single glyphs (no good), and overlaps that happen on the font
    level between different glyphs? Isn't the latter necessarily what happens in connecting
    scripts? (Bear with me, I've never made one.)

    for overlapping paths in an individual glyph.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a problem
    if you want to visualize the outlines of the font, but any software that lets
    you do that must also provide you with an option to merge the separate forms into

    seems to be true for text editors, though I'd like to see it explicitly specified.
    On the other hand, Inkscape (and probably Adobe Illustrator) keeps track of the
    winding direction. Here, I installed and used in Inkscape a (postscript otf) font
    with a small o that winds opposite to the small \xF4. If I put the o on top of
    the \xF4, there is no problem,  they merge nicely and give the \xF4 on the left.
    If I copy them and appy path > combine on the copy, I get the \xF4 on the right
    hand side; the two glyphs o almost cancel.\r\n<p></p><img src=\"/files/ooo_5048.png\"><p></p>\r\n[Image
