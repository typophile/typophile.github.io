    I think this has other names, and I think we have talked about it before.\r\n\r\n-

    Roman</a> at Dafont. It may not be the best digitization. I bet Mike F. knows

  body: Thanks! I went online and read a previous thread on Typophile and got some
    leads and actually found the font on a very old CD Sampler. I couldn't have done
