  a repost:\r\n\r\n\"Born in S\xE8vres (France) in 1926, still active today, Jos\xE9
  Mendoza y Almeida is the \u2018godfather\u2019 of French type design. He gained
  international recognition from the most famous typefoundries who published his best
  known typefaces. During his long career, which has also involved graphic design
  and calligraphy jobs for publishing and advertising, he collaborated with important
  figures such as Maximilien Vox and Roger Excoffon. He also taught type design within
  the Imprimerie nationale, at its Atelier national de cr\xE9ation typographique.\r\n\r\nThis
  book, the first ever dedicated to his work, features an introduction by Jan Middendorp
  and several essays on Pascal, Photina, ITC Mendoza Roman and other less-known typefaces,
  written by Martin Majoor and S\xE9bastien Morlighem. Many unpublished documents
  are reproduced in the book for the first time.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ypsilonediteur.com/fiche.php?id=86"

  body: "Hey Martin - thanks for the heads up.\r\n\r\nIt's a delight to be able to
    read such a great book about such a great man - I've been lucky enough to spend
    some time with Jose at his Sevres home while preparing my upcoming book about
    Excoffon, and I'm happy that this tribute comes at the right time."
