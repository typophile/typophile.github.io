  body: "I would suggest researching what kind of things your audience likes; what
    kind of clothes do they wear (what design is on their t-shirt) what do the graphics
    look like on the cover of the cd's, etc. Does all this relate to the font you
    have chosen? Does it speak the same language?\r\nHope this helps"
