body: I don&#39;t know if this question has already been asked or not, but I was wondering
  if this was/is an actual font used for the movie rating system. If not something
  very close to it. Advanced thanks for your help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65602.jpg"

  body: It wouldn&#39;t be too hard. Given the MPAA&#39;s ridiculous litigious nature,
    however, I&#39;d prefer to follow rather than lead. My inner craving to really
    stick it to them will have to be satisfied in some other, perhaps more satisfying
    way <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
