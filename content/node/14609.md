  body: 'I agree with my time in Ad Agencies. One of the ones I worked for was marginal
    at best (mid sized), it made its money from pitching. Nationally they would be
    the third or even fourth agency chosen to pitch an account and would always loose
    the pitch either coming in second or third. At first I didn''t understand how
    they stayed in business but it occured to me they got a big fee to pitch for each
    account. We often spent 20K to 50K per pitch. The agency eventually partnered
    with another agency from Canada that looked at the business model and pullled
    out. After that agency went down faster that the Titanic. Another one bites the
    dust.  '

  body: Yup, and I think the only way to do it would be with two large cap "P" with
    small cap "IM" in between. Let's show them our fangs.
