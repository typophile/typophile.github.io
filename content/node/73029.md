body: "Hello,\r\nI am still thinking about creating an unique font, which automatically
  changes letter types as You write. Easy to say - when I write \"Praha\", I do not
  want to have the both letters \"a\" exactly the same, but a bit different, for example
  with some \"print errors\" You get while printing at the old huge machines...\r\n\r\nIs
  the some software way to create this on PC? Or do I have to do it manually?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any answer...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The standard method is to use a font which has such \"randomness\" built-in
    as an OpenType feature: Contextual Alternates.\r\nThis feature is active by default
    in those applications which support OpenType features, such as the Adobe Creative
    Suite and Quark XPress. \r\n\r\nYou can see this in action at MyFonts, for my
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/duffy-script/\">Duffy Script</a>
    font (click on \"Contextual Alternates\" in the \"Advanced typography\" menu).
    I made the font using FontLab, which enables feature programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the OpenType [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#rand|Randamize]]
    feature fits well for your purpose.\r\n\r\nI use it to re-implement a [[http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/punknova|randomized
    font]] that was first done in Metafont, essentially there are several alternates
    for each glyph, all mapped to a \"rand\" feature and the layout engine selects
    between them randomly (check a [[http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/punknova/documentation/sample.pdf|sample]]).
    However, AFAIK, support for this feature is almost non existent, and I know only
    one OpenType implementation that supports it."

  body: Apart from the lack of support for "rand", the biggest piss-off for "calt"
    pseudo-random effects is that layout applications disable them beyond a very narrow
    range of tracking, on the assumption that contextual substitutions are exclusively
    for cursive ligatures.

    gives the user no control. \r\n\r\nThe cutoff point can actually be specified
    in Quark. The Preferences > Character \u2014 Ligatures \u2014 Break Above: field
    will be respected for the OT {calt} feature, not just ligatures (OTL or not).
    So, set it to something like 40 and track to your heart\u2019s content. (And remember,
    40 Quark units = 200 InDesign units.)"

  body: "I've designed lots of fonts which offer alternate versions of the characters,
    usually limited to about 3 variations.  I've found that the best way to do it
    is to put the alternates in the positions accessed by using the standard key for
    that character in combination with alt or shift-alt on the Mac keyboard.\r\n\r\nThis
    isn't random, but it allows you to access multiple versions of the characters
    and in many ways it is better because you can control which version appears where,
    which is desirable when some variations of the character are quite different from
    the main style.\r\n\r\nDave"

    works if you are on a Mac with US keyboard, right? I mean, if you put an alternate
    w in the alt + w combination, you are using the slot (that should be) for \u2211
    . But if I press alt + w on my Spanish-ISO keyboard, I get \xE6. I get \u2211
    by pressing alt + x."
