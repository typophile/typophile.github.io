  me. I hazard to guess drawn by some in Europe because of the super ellipse and the
  structure of the U.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/someletters_3446.png]"

  body: "The plot thickens.\r\nCarolus is a Roger White font.\r\nThe provenance of
    his fonts is perhaps doubtful. See http://typophile.com/node/71453.\r\nI wonder
    what the source is for Carolus?\r\nIf you could use substitutes, Testament CT,
    Solemnis, FF Lukreza, and Simeon AS are somewhat similar.\r\nDon"

    himself based on a scan.\r\nSo, if this is the case, I wonder what he scanned?\r\nDon"

  body: 'Ha! Here''s one I recognise from home. :) You''re right, Donald, that the
    provenance is doubtful: Carolus was originally designed by Karl-Erik Forsberg,
    perhaps the greatest of Swedish type designers. More here: http://typophile.com/node/68425'

  body: "Great find Johan.\r\nExcellent discussion of the issues raised by Carolus.\r\nStockholm
    would work as a substitute for most purposes, but it's clear that a quality digitization
    of the original Carolus still does not exist.\r\nDon"

  body: I have Carolus through a bundle license I did a million years ago so at least
    I won't have to use a substitute.

  body: "http://typophile.com/node/68425 included a comment that a good character
    set of Carolus is in Lindgren's  ABC book. If anyone is interested in seeing it,
    check  \"ABC of Lettering and Printing Typefaces: A Complete Guide to the Letters
    and Typefaces Used for Typesetting and Printing\" by Erik Lindgren, [1964?]. I
    just bought a used copy at a very attractive price from Amazon.\r\nTempting to
    do a good quality digitization. Depends in part just how good the specimen is
    in Lindgren's book. \r\ndon "
