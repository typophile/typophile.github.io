  body: this is really rough, do you think if i fine tuned the four hundred type it
    could work? i think i will try using Linotype Zapfino and maybe like Scriptina
    in it&#39;s place tonight. i just really wanted to use some hand drawn type, although
    you&#39;re right, i was rushing and could have done it better.

  body: Ben, I actually like the script and the serif face individually, but not necessarily
    together. I&#39;m not sure why. Perhaps the &#39;WORDS&#39; has a character that&#39;s
    too strong to sit with the script. <BR> <BR>Regardless, I like the the logo, but
    agree with H

  body: Well figure C definitively improved but A and B seem the best for me. The
    engraved font in C has a lot of charm, which font is it? did you made it?

  body: the engraved looking font in C is called ermine, no, i did not make it. i
    also like A quite a bit.. but it feels sort of like a cop out, since it&#39;s
    just hoefler small caps on hoefler swash italic caps..

  body: I like variant C the best by far.  <BR> <BR>Variant A is fine, but a bit boring,
    even with the swashes. The B variant just looks like a black blob, and the D variant
    for some reason says &#34;1970s&#34; to me.

  body: 'I&#39;m not a fan of D, but you&#39;ve got to experiement with these things
    haven&#39;t you? <BR> <BR>A&#39;s nice, but perhaps a bit too nice. It&#39;d be
    useful to know what kind of non-fiction this publication is looking to publish.
    I guess they&#39;ll say &#39;anything and everything&#39; but they must have a
    direction in mind -- is the direction scientific? religious? serious and formal?
    loose and humorous? <BR> <BR>I actually really like B: it looks like the title
    of a 70s naturist photography book. Not that I own any 70s naturist photography
    books, but you &#40;hopefully don&#39;t&#41; know what I mean. <BR> <BR>Seriously,
    it looks like with a bit of work it could, well, work. A little spacing &#40;between
    w and o, and r and d&#41; and a slight resizing and loosening of the 400, and
    I think it could work. I won&#39;t promise anything though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>C is the most coherant concept, though I actually
    prefer your handwritten &#40;I presume&#41; in your first post. If you tidied
    the sript up a little on that one &#40;the R&#39;s and the tail on the f promarily&#41;
    I think it could be a really nice idea.  <BR> <BR>The regularity of the script
    in C is a little mundane compared to the example in your opening post. I&#39;ll
    add my name to the list of admirers of that engraved face though -- it&#39;s lovely.

  body: 'A: I&#39;m not a fan of this. I&#39;ve never like swash caps in one word
    without any sort of custom ligatures to unify them. It always struck me as a bunch
    of beauty contestants in a row, rather than an integrated team. <BR> <BR>B: I
    really like the type, but the visual cues draw cultural and historical associations
    that don&#39;t feel relevant or wanted for your purpose. <BR> <BR>C: I think this
    is the most appropriate, though I prefer the less formal feel of the original
    script. I think this one is worth further efforts and variations. I like the contrast
    of the informal against the formal, but with all hand-written forms &#40;Ermine
    doesn&#39;t strike me as an engraved face, or am I wrong?&#41;. <BR> <BR>D: This
    one doesn&#39;t feel bad to me, but it doesn&#39;t feel right to me either. It
    strikes me more as a title that&#39;s logo-ish, rather than a logo that speaks
    to writing.'

  body: 'I join the chorus singing for the first concept:  the &#39;WORDS&#39; looks
    great. And I like the nearly matching stroke-thickness between the thin parts
    of the WORD-letters and the stroke-thickness in your handwriting. That&#39;s why
    I&#39;d vote for version nr. 1. <BR> <BR>But the main reason why I prefer the
    first example is that I think that the different sizes of the two words provide
    more energy than the two similar sized words in the examples presented in your
    pdf. So I would start by reworking the &#39;Fourhundred&#39; a bit. <BR> <BR>Another
    idea concerning the Fourhundred/400: have you already tried to draw something
    like that swinging f-bow with the 4? That could be nice because of their formal
    similarity.'

  body: I liked your original concept of combining a hand-drawn font with a more formal
    set font. And I believe you can continue that concept as you experiment with a
    more urban feel. Perhaps a grafiti style of hand-drawn lettering or a broken typewriter
    look might give the client the edgier/urban look she wants. Then again these could
    be obvious/trite suggestions. Surban girl from Connecticut might not be the best
    source for edgy/urban ideas. Keep posting I&#39;ve enjoyed seeing your process.

    more urban outfittery, more hip, some color into the mix.. although it must reproduce
    well in 1 color, as it will be letterpress printed, and i&#39;m not really grooving
    on printing a bunch of colors inclose register just for the logo.. <BR> <BR><img
