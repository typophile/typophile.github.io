  body: Both the R and the Risom are custom lettering, as were most logos from the
    1950s. Are you looking to recreate the logo or are you just looking for something
    similar?

  body: I'm looking to recreate the logo to look exact. I guess I can redraw it in
    illustrator and trace, but thought someone here would know. Thanks for the reply.

  body: Jens is still alive. <a href="http://midcenturymodernist.com/2010/furniture-objects/designers-makers/risom-reborn/">I
    interviewed him last year.</a> You could ask him or his representatives at Rocket
    for the original drawings, assuming you're doing something for the company.
