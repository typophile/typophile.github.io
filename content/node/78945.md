  smaller uppercase letters because of so many capitalized words. I imagine that Bodoni
  was designed for Italian. We also know international fonts.\r\nDoes anybody has
  a clue, hint or information about some serious literature about this problem.\r\nI
  am interested in visual characteristics of all official European languages.\r\nThanks
  for any suggestion or help."

  body: "Thanks.\r\nI find the texts quite interesting, specially the first one.\r\nDiacritics
    are quite a great problem. The x height has to be smaller to allocate enough space
    for all the carons \u2026 Specially the problem in Turkish and Ungarian. \r\nBut
    what about the visual character of a text - its visual structure as a whole. "

  body: "I know that I saw at least one book on typography that showed samples of
    text in German, Italian, French, and English in typefaces said to be especially
    suited to each one, and then in an \"international\" typeface that suited them
    all well.\r\n\r\nSadly, while I'm sure I still have it, I can't put my hands on
    it right away at the moment. I think it had a white dustjacket, and a nice illustration
    of all the characters in the font used for the Gutenberg Bible, and was large
    in size. (Pages were roughly 8 1/2\" by 11\" size, but not exactly - the width
    of a page in proportion to its height was greater than for that size of page.)"

    French and English (I think). The idea was to show that that look and feels was
    the same even in 3 diferent languages.\r\nIn the Adrian frutiger complete works
    book has lots of information about univers construction.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "<em>Das Detail in der Typografie</em> by Jost Hochuli compares German text
    in two notations.\r\n\r\nThere were some attempts in mid-war Poland and Czechoslovakia,
    to replace diagonals with curved strokes, but they were rather utopian. I think
    that Minion works great with Polish language, byt I cannot precise my opinion;
    Minion has lots of details running in all directions, so the main diagonals, responsible
    for the irregularity - disappear."
