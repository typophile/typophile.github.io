<ol>
<li>What what choices were made, and why?</li>
<li>Kerning characters can only go so far. What glyph alterations can improve spacing/color?</li>
<li>What are the common differences between type designed for text and display type of the same family?</li>

<p>Here are the results from my first breakdown:
When set to default in ITC Franklin Gothic Demi Cond., “Bank of America” has many holes. It looks like small type trying to be big. The comparison (font in red, logo in black) reveals a bolder weight to the logo, a wider apex to the A, extended ear of the r, raised dot of the i, extended ascender of the k, and an altered e.</p>
<p>Concluded reasoning:
Generally, thickening the letterstroke connections helps when the logo is used at small scale. The widening of the A had to happen since the weights are heavier. Same with the r. The redesign of the e helps visually distance it from the r without physically moving it, thereby evening the spacing of the mer. The raised dot of the i eliminates the line formed by the negative space in the font. Not sure why the k was heightened. In the end, the logo is far more robust, confident, and than just setting the type in Franklin Gothic.</p>

<p>Nick, thanks- I should know better than to blindly pick from what was available on my computer.</p>
<p>Dan, while I am aware that spacing must be different for specific types of projects, my goal is to learn how to improve type in general. Of course, there is no universal solution, and my resources on the project&rsquo;s background is limited. I can only work with what I have, and from that I hope to gain at least some understanding on the technicalities.</p>

<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got to start somehwere, and you did.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the MOMA typeface redesign? It was done recently, by Matthew Carter, and is a reworking of Franklin Gothic, with variants for text and display if I recall correctly, which speaks to Dan&rsquo;s point about context.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You hit on some great observations here koleslaw. Yes in fact you are right&hellip;type designed for smaller sizes has less contrast between thick and thin. Large display type can have high contrast, be tightly spaced and still be quite legible but at smaller point sizes the spacing and letter weight have to be adjusted to compensate for the small size. But the goal is that when comparing the two at <em>different</em> sizes, they will <em>appear</em> to be identical. Like an optical illusion. This probably also has something to do (I would guess) with why the &ldquo;k&rdquo; is higher on the one. It reminds me of how the ancient Greeks used to carve the columns on their temples so that the sides actually bowed outwards slighty. This made the sides appear perfectly straight&hellip;a truly straight column would look concave. (or so they say).</div>
