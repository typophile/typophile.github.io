body: "Being a novice typophile, I've been trying to read what I can about history,
  designs, and utility of typefaces. Recently been introduced to the Times, Times
  NR, and Starling intrigue. Older posts here in 2006-2009 suggest that a few designers
  would meet with Mike Parker at a convention... but no one seemed to post results,
  if any, of the meetings.\r\n\r\nSo, I was curious about 3 issues:\r\n\r\n1. What
  has the type industry understood to be the more accurate history relating to Times:
  the conventional story or MP's version ?\r\n\r\n2. How has the typeface Starling
  (Font Bureau) performed in technical production, and is the typeface selling well?\r\n\r\n3.
  For years, I've had some negative view of Times somehow implanted in me as being
  a technically flawed typeface... but in the 1994 C. Bigelow interview, it seems
  that both Monotype and Linotype had spent years fine-tuning almost everything about
  the typeface. Just playing around with Times last night, with a different mindset,
  allowed me to see that it is interesting in its own (early 20th century, and yet
  forward thinking) way. Is Times just misunderstood, or do professionals truly find
  flaws with it?\r\n\r\nCheers."

    it's intended to do quite well I think.

    of Mike''s examination of the Lanston archives, which were then owned by Gerald
    Giampa and housed in Vancouver. I spent time with Mike and Gerald at Lanston,
    and heard Mike''s initial ideas on the subject first hand. The article that he
    wrote for the journal of the American Printing Historical Society is well worth
    reading: its a good piece of research, whatever one thinks of the conclusions.
    With regard to the conclusions, I''m resigned to the fact that there is unlikely
    ever to be incontrovertible evidence either way. Mike''s account could be true,
    or it could be a splendidly elaborate hoax -- not necessarily on Mike''s part,
    I should add.'

  body: "Maybe 20 years ago I was perusing the stacks and came across a book set in
    Times -- it was machine-set metal, but I don't remember if from Linotype, Monotype,
    or some other foundry; set in a size a bit larger than normally encountered, and
    with long descenders. I remember it as being not quite as condensed, but that
    may be untrue -- can be hard to tell with the slightly larger sizes in metal.
    I believe it was a work of essays -- in any case, a work of literature. I remember
    it as being quite beautiful. Like an idiot, I didn't write down the title. \r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\nI set a lot of Times in the early 1980s. You're quite right, it is a good
    typeface. We still have an early Type 1 PostScript Times font from the early 1990s
    that I think superior to most offerings today. I cannot remember the foundry (publisher).
    We probably got it from Adobe, as that's where we got most of our cross-licensed
    fonts -- but with Times, maybe not.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while I contemplate
    going over it, adding both OT features and some more work on the glyphs themselves,
    but am always brought up short because modern text designers will just not specify
    it."

    of it, for whatever reason, are not as appealing to me. Maybe they could be flawed,
    although I expected them to be identical except for leading... but that isn't
    really true, hence Times Ten.

    true. There are others both larger and privately owned.\r\n\r\nA, Jasonc, \"I'm
    a little unclear on what downscaling a jpg shows about the effort...\"\r\n\r\nIt
    gets bigger if you click on it don't it? It's not about hinting, as I would be
    the last to crit the hinting of Times Roman. It's about the times families, and
    their technical execution, as asked in the original post.\r\n\r\nI have not doubt
    that Monotype and Linotype made the various Times families, and by now, individual
    styles of those families are more related to that, than to anything anyone else
    might have designed in the past.\r\n\r\nTimes regular, which is very close in
    all versions of Times, is the main issue of originality. Here, Mike, I and others
    were intrigued by two facts. The first is that SM never said, \"I designed Times\".
    The second is that type designers and devlopers have historically come from, gold
    smithing, gun smithing, architecture, mathematics, ship building and piracy. If
    Gutenberg, Caslon, Goodhue, Knuth, Karow and Blackbeard could do it, why not Burgess,
    or as the paper needed to evolve into action why not Parker. \r\n\r\nThe resulting
    Starling, forgetting the whole Burgess vs Morison thing, is an elegant seaworthy
    series for all sizes, with excellent flight capabilities to the web and dymaxionistic
    lines regardless of output device and it's doing well.\r\n"

    one ventures into actually using any of the Times variants in professional settings?\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'm reminded of another recent post where Nick Shinn was making the observation
    that his \"Scotch Modern\" was perhaps a transition from the Moderns/didones to
    post-modern transitional types. As a novice, I had somehow thought that Times
    was essentially the milestone marker into the (later) Transitionals... but I might
    see Nick's point about Scotch Modern...\r\n\r\nObviously, Times did play a vital
    role in the evolution of type... but is it now essentially dead? Are the children
    of Times consistently seeing their genes in the eyes of Old Style types, and purposefully
    looking the other way when Times is mentioned?\r\n\r\nJust a few poetic questions...

    font, about the only time I see Times these days is in older documents on line
    and in the pages of the Times Literary Supplement, a publication that as a result
    looks decidedly oldfashioned.\r\n\r\nJames Mosley observed some years ago that,
    although nominally a newspaper face, some of the best uses of Times -- in the
    Monotype metal version -- was in book typesetting. But it's been quite a while
    since I last saw a book set in Times.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Starling types,
    the really remarkable -- and somewhat unnerving thing -- is the italics. The romans
    are a sensible adaptation of the historical design, better coordinated across
    the weight range than any version of Times, but the italics are something entirely
    new. I say they're unnerving because we're so used to the old Times italics being
    paired with those roman forms."
