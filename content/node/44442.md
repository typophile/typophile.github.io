  had originally planned on using animals whose names happened not to have descenders,
  so I had to change the design a bit when <strong>g</strong>eese suddenly became
  funny at my school. I sort of like the descender, but I feel like I need to fill
  some of the space to its right.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20080419-geese_puppies-grey50-different_red-lores-white-proof_3485.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20080419-geese_puppies-grey50-different_red-lores_3926.png]"

  body: "The thing that strikes me most about your design is not the line spacing
    but the hierachy; 'geese' which i am assuming is the important bit plays second
    fiddle to the 'I \"club\"'.  The descending sizes as you go down the page are
    also slightly reminiscent of an eye test poster which is a little odd.\r\nWith
    the spacing of the last line have you considered not having the 'for \"diamond\"
    \"diamond\"' below the main body of the line as to my eyes it throws the whole
    thing off balance.\r\nHope this helps.\r\n"

    like having the top line smaller. I had tried making the bottom lines one before
    and hadn't liked it, but I like it now. This may be partly because there is clearer
    contrast between the two parts of the sentence now that the first two lines are
    the same size. Here's a version with two lines at the bottom in case anyone wants
    to compare.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20080420-geese_puppies-twolines_3793.png]\r\nI
    used a slightly darker color for the second part of the sentence in the version
    where the second part of the sentence is one line because I was copying it from
    another version that had a slightly darker color. Now that I've tried it, I actually
    like it slightly darker; are there any guidelines about whether or how much to
    make small text darker?"
