  body: "It would help if you had given some idea as to the date of the book i.e.
    1910s, 1920s, 1950s, 1990s etc. This might be a font for which a digital version
    has not been made. It would also help if you had posted a larger scale image with
    some \"earmark\" letters such as g, Q, K, R, A, M.\r\nThe posted image is, however,
    sufficient to make a suggestion or two. \r\nI note its low contrast and, using
    my imaginary microscope, I believe I might be seeing large rounded serifs dished
    at the midpoint.  This type of font is sometimes described as being in an English
    vernacular style. \r\nSo as a digital substitute I could perhaps recommend <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/plantagenet/\">Plantagenet</a> by  Ross
    Mills of Trio Typeworks. The lowercase a is two story rather than single, but
    the flavor of Plantagenet is the same as your sample.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PlantagenetInUse_4234.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "The single story lowercase a is sometimes found in digital fonts used in
    children's books, school use, and language teaching. The ones I spotted -- such
    as Bembo Schoolbook and Plantin Schoolbook -- do not match your sample. \r\nDon"

  Thanks!
