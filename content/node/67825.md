  some more reference material. Specifically, I'm looking for examples of Tony DiSpigna's
  work and his Spencerian Scripts such as this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/herb_lubalin_063.jpg]\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone point me to a website or PDF that I can study multiple examples of his work?"
