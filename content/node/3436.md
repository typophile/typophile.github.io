  body: Hello, Lacey. Welcome to Typophile. <BR> <BR>This is fun and quirky. I think
    the best way to get a feel for any font is to see it in action. Can you set a
    paragraph for us? I think the top of the _s_ needs to go over to the right a bit
    further.

    <BR>That is how I read it anyway. Hehe!

  body: this typeface is based on female proportions... all of the characters are
    narrow at the top and wider at the bottom to emulate the fact that women have
    narrower shoulders and wider hips than men <BR>I wanted to eliminate descenders
    to keep the forms bulbous.

  body: this typeface will also have a series of &#34;snap-on serifs&#34; that will
    show changes in American women&#39;s history.  the base font &#40;women&#41; stays
    the same, while as history &#40;the snap on serifs&#41; continue to add more and
    more facets to women.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27830.jpg"

  body: 'I think this is an interesting idea - I&#39;m personally very interested
    in seeing how anthropomorphism can be incorporated into type. But there&#39;s
    one key thing I think you&#39;re missing: for it to work it has to be very very
    subtle. As a designer it&#39;s hard to restrain one&#39;s abilities to implement
    an idea as strongly as possible - but controlling what people <i>won&#39;t</i>
    see is fundamental. I would suggest starting by taking an &#34;elemental&#34;
    font &#40;I like to use Lucida&#41; and seeing how you can bend it to convey something
    - not convey literally, but more implicitly. <BR> <BR>The other thing is that
    the thinner your strokes the more you&#39;re limiting the smallest size the font
    can actually be used at. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s not easy making a descender-less
    font - look at Hobo for some inspiration. &#40;Any others, guys? And gals?  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The &#34;snap-on&#34; stuff is cool. It seems to go way beyong
    anything like it I&#39;ve seen &#40;including Carter&#39;s Walker&#41;, by letting
    you add things like stroke contrast - pretty ingenious. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Lacey, have you considered each variation having different proportions? This
    would reflect the fact that all women are proportioned differently. <BR> <BR>I

  body: Would anyone in the class that&#39;s making all these &#34;high-concept&#34;
    fonts like to tell me what program they&#39;re using that implements these &#34;snap-on
    serifs&#34; that aren&#39;t necessarily serifs? How do they work? I&#39;ve never
    heard of such a thing before.

  body: 'The preeminent &#34;snap-on&#34; font is Matthew Carter&#39;s custom design
    for the Walker Art Center: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/walker.gif"

    that case the snap-ons are indeed serifs, but they don&#39;t have to be. Basically
    you could make any sort of add-ons &#40;with shapes assigned to keystrokes&#41;,
    and as long as you maintain the advance-widths of the base glyphs you can overlay
    them nicely. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
