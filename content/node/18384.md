body: "I am creating a PDF specimen which I would like to open in full screen mode
  when people download the file.\r\nDespite specifying this in Acrobat, when the file
  icon is double-clicked, it still opens in the OS X \"Preview\" application, with
  menu palettes. That's because the OS X default for viewing PDFs is Preview, damnit
  (I also detest the default that \"opens\" PDFs accessed online in Safari).\r\n\r\nI
  have tried specifying Acrobat as the opening application, by using the \"get info\"
  dialog, but it only permits one Acrobat version to be specified, not Acrobat in
  general.\r\n\r\nIs there a way around this?"

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nYou might try to delete the preference file for Preview. Under
    your home directory, visit the library folder/preferences and delete the com.apple.preview.plist
    file. Empty your trash and try and double click on that PDF. Sometimes the poor
    Mac OS is a little selfish when it comes to giving up ownership. Hope it works
    and if I can think of anything else, I'll gladly repost. Best,\r\nDaphne"

    it working that way for anyone who downloads the file.

  body: "I wouldn't expect to be able to control how Mac (or any) users view a PDF
    file. I assume that any feature like this would be strictly opt-in, but I don't
    think there's any way to force a full-screen mode. \r\nOn the Mac, there's just
    a lot of software diversity, both with whatever browser the person has, and the
    way they chose to view PDFs. "

  body: If I recall correctly, the first 3 versions of OS X supported the "open in
    full screen" feature that could be built into an Acrobat file, because double-clicked
    Acrobat files were opened in Acrobat (makes sense, eh?!) But with "Tiger", Preview,
    which does not support that feature, has pre-empted Acrobat.

  body: 'Preview opens much faster than Acrobat, and has a small memory footprint,
    so I leave it open at all times. I also have it associated with most simple image
    types, jpg, tif, png, etc. This is handy for people who don''t have P''shop running
    at all times, since it can perform minor image edits as well. '

  body: 'The problem with Preview is directly related to what Nick wants: full-screen
    reading/viewing. I use Preview when I want quick look-sees, but I use Acrobat
    for full-screen portfolio viewing and (not necessarily full-screen) proof approval.
    Preview also does not respect the more advanced transparency features.'

    in the document settings (acrobat). When it saves the file then it makes a true
    adobe pdf, rather than osx adding an extension (and assocaited program) :D\r\n\r\nThis
    works here with acrobat 7\r\n\r\nMatt"
