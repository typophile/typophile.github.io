body: Anyone know of a typeface designed by David Carson?  I know he was a founder
  of GarageFonts and Beach Culture and Ray Gun and so on.  But everywhere I look it
  says he&#39;s a type designer &#40;and the paper I&#39;m writing requires an example&#41;
  but nowhere I look mentions the name of a single typeface!!!! HELP!

    of flair and quality. I think Carson once called Miles \"the ideal type designer\"
    or something on that order.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
