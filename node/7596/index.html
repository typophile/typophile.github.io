  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello. This is my first stab at font building. It is not an original design, but my attempt at recreating the fonts found in the <i>Oeuvres de Descartes</i> series published by J. Vrin in the 1970s. It was pointed out to me by someone named Claude on a fonts newsgroup that the Titling capitals were derived from the work of Louis Perrin (The Lyons Capitals). If any one has any additional information on these fonts or any critique of how to improve the design, I would really appreciate it! Some of the glyphs (like the italic `k') I could not find in the book, and I am not quite sure how to make it fit with the other letters. Also, I know that the Italic caps are butt ugly, because I haven't been much interested in improving them (they rarely come up in use for me). But I'd still appreciate suggestions on them. You people seem to know a lot about good typography! <BR> <BR><!--attachment: EPerrinPro-53155.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*69.7*PDF+Sample+Specimen*EPerrinPro%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">PDF Sample Specimen<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/EPerrinPro-53155.pdf" target="_blank"><b>EPerrinPro.pdf</b></a> (69.7 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

Dunno. <BR> <BR>* Which Audin notes was actually a copy of the Augustaux in the UC but not the lc. So if the titling and body face in that book were part of the same font, the likelihood that it is a Baudoire (but how did they print it in the 1970s - was it a facsimile of a much older work?)

		<div class="commentbody"><a href="http://www.eventide.ca/typography" target="_blank">Access to Scans</a> <BR> <BR>Hrant and Jean, thanks so much for the input! I have put together a page of scans as well as a link to the PDF that is a bit updated (I noticed a few details that needed to be changed). It is interesting that you describe these kinds of fonts as being a bit wunky, which is what initially inspired me to make them. I like escpecially the narrow top on the e and c, as well as the backward slope of the b, the lovely g, etc. But especially I love the Capital R. <BR> <BR>The first time I saw the titling font was on the cover of <i>Pensees Diverses sur la Comete.</i> I noticed the spine while browsing through the philosophy books at school. I just absolutely loved these letters, especially the capital R. The cover of this book is what first got me interested in typography last winter! <BR> <BR>In the same section I found the series on Descartes, which is quite an important resource for Descartes scholars. The editions definitely look like they were produced photographically to me and contains many different fonts. One of the problems in identifying the fonts is that there are so many different ones used in the series.  <BR> <BR>I chose to work from Tome Six, since this is the cleanest copy we have. I based the font off the largest of the type, which is about 14pt. The original's italic has a noticeably lower x-height than the regular; I kept it lower but not as much as in the original.  <BR> <BR>The font in the introduction and in the footnotes is different than the main body text, but I did not reference this in the design (in fact the small fonts seem to resemble very much JFP's <i>Bertrand</i>). Also, the small caps do not seem to be based on the capitals, but are possibly from another typeface. I decided to retain their flavour anyway. The original numerals are very ugly, and I tried to make them prettier (this is where I made the most change). <BR> <BR>Interestingly, the italics used at different sizes all seem to be the same design, but drawn slightly differently. For example, the smaller ones are curvier, while the stems on the full size are straighter. <BR> <BR>I hope that we can achieve a correct identification so that it can be named properly and I can learn more of the history of the designs. I would like to look at those books that you recommended, Hrant, but they are typography books are not available here in Winnipeg. Hopefully I will be able to buy some books at some point, but they are generally prohibitively expensive (I am a philosophy student). If you can post any scans from your books I would really appreciate it!</div>

I guess Floch (who printed the book) made his own? <BR> <BR>Googling `ovink beaudoire' turns up nothing useful. Can you suggest to me where I can get access to this book? Is it purchase-able?

<cite>Audin</cite> was the one who <cite>knew</cite> stuff.  But I&rsquo;m glad I could help.</p>
<p>The Ovink thing is a 3-part article titled &ldquo;Nineteenth-century reactions against the didone type model&rdquo;, published in the Dutch journal Quærendo - a really useful series. The Beaudoire bit is in part 2. I don&rsquo;t seem to have kept an exact reference for that, but fishing through some old emails I can see that part <cite>three</cite> is in V2 #2 (1972). If you have trouble finding it, try to find an index to Quærendo (I know they published indeces, plus it might be online), or look through the complete Ovink bibliography in Quaerendo Volume 14 #1 (1984), pp 8-17. If you <cite>still</cite> can&rsquo;t find it, let me know.</p>
<p>So are you trying to find a good name for the font? It&rsquo;s tricky, because Beaudoire&rsquo;s work* was apparently derivative to some extent. But I wouldn&rsquo;t call it Perrin [any more]. The only thing I can think of is &ldquo;Théophile&rdquo;. Or maybe something related to mid/late-19th century France.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least that design; there&rsquo;s actually a font in Audin &lsquo;28 by Beaudoire that&rsquo;s a quite charming upright cursive - even though Audin himself calls it &ldquo;bien laide&rdquo; (quite ugly).</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW, check <cite>this</cite> out:
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/familytree.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/familytree.html">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/familytree.html</a></a>
But looking through my stuff, that &ldquo;g&rdquo; -and the lc in general- makes it look closer to the &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo; of Miller &amp; Richard of Edinburgh (an &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; take on the Elzevir) than the French stuff. And tellingly, the same guy who made Romana made ATF De Vinne!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I used to live off of Inter-Library Loans!  :-) Then I sort of ran out of things to request. Well, not really, stuff still pops up once in a while. <BR> <BR>It suddenly hit me that I have a copy of Ovink's obituary (he was da man), which contains a comprehensive bibliography of his writings*. So the Elzevir stuff is in Volume 1, #4, pp 282-301 (1971). <BR> <BR>* And actually looking through Part 3 of the series I now see a reference to part two with a full citation. <BR> <BR>The numerals: <BR>I don't know if it's better to go with the Perrin style or the Beaudoire/Marquet style. Or maybe something else entirely, even your own design. But even if (or maybe <i>especially</i> if) you go with the Perrin style, don't be too shy about fixing things. When I look at what you had in your most-recent iteration, it strikes me that the proportional divergences are quaint and probably in character, but the &quot;8&quot; simply is too ugly because of its huge top. <BR> <BR>BTW, I got some more goodies for you: <BR>While I was looking for something else I ran into the single most important publication about Perrin that I know of: Audin's book on the 1923 Perrin exhibition in Lyon. It's quite rare - it seems only 61 copies were printed. There's a very extensive text (120 pages), a complete catalog of works, and some great facsimiles (as well as actual prints -like pressmarks- from Perrin's own engravings). The paper is very yellowed though. There are two things in there that will probably interesting you most: <BR> <BR>1) A facsimile of Perrin's famous specimen sheet, showing two sizes that are basically Marquet's designs: the 11 and the second 14. Here are scans: <BR>(488Kb) <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_11Marquet.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_11Marquet.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_11Marquet.gif</a></a> <BR>(567Kb) <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_14Marquet.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_14Marquet.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_14Marquet.gif</a></a> <BR>The second scan is a collage from two sections of the sheet. <BR>If you want more details about the specimen let me know. <BR> <BR>2) This is cool. A character set of floriated caps, from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;V&quot;. Here's the &quot;R&quot;: <BR>(87Kb) <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_florR.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_florR.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Perrin_florR.gif</a></a> <BR>BTW, that's a RIP-killer right there&hellip; <BR> <BR>Concerning the Marquet fonts, I guess it's safe to conclude that Perrin spliced in his own caps and numerals - although I can't be 100% sure. And Beaudoire seems to have partly parroted this mix-and-match deal for some reason. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Add it at the extrema of the curve. <BR> <BR>The tails on p and q look good in the alphabet presentation, but are too long when you look at them in lines of text. <BR> <BR>I think this looks great. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the critiques. Right now I am on a holiday and so I cannot work on the design. But I will definitely make a list of the suggestions and try their implementation when I get home. <BR> <BR>Foremost will be the spacing and kerning of the characters. I have been meaning to redo this entirely, since I figured how to achieve better spacing with less kerning while making the italic; but this will be a big task for the number of glyphs in the roman (regular, sc, titling, accents&hellip;). I didn't notice before how wide the spacing on the <code>t&amp;#39; is, so any more comments about spacing woulr be great. It is hard to tell what is off after I have become so used to the spacing. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Looking at the </code>Q', I can see what you mean about the tail being too frail. Sometimes I was unsure about whether to follow the perrin, beaudoire or version from Les Oevres de Descartes most closely. But I from now on I will try to just balance out the family over all. <BR> <BR>Jon: The lc <code>s&amp;#39;, c e and a are based on the ones in Oevres de Descartes, which are somewhat different than all the others. I think that they look much better anyway, especially the s which matches more nicely to the uc </code>S.' But having ball terminals does match better with the italic; which do you think looks better in the roman?  <BR> <BR>Re: the asterisk, I wish that I could take credit for this, but it is exactly the one in Oevres de Descartes. It is one of my favorite glyphs from there since it is different from most. But thanks about the dagger and the BP glyph. Those are ones I actually did make. <BR> <BR>My descenders on <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> from the italic are actually a bit shorter than from the orinigal ones. I know that they do not blend perfectly with the roman for this reason, but in the original the two were never set on the same line. When I did make them shorter, I felt that a lost of their distinct character was lost. When I get back I will try making it with shorter descenders on those glyphs and you guys can tell me what you think. <BR> <BR>Hrant: I do not know exactly what you mean about the top of the t being out of character. Can you elaborate? Do you mean that the sloped part should be more curvy than it is now?</div>

Just know the issues (like proper distribution of Cartesian* area usage, glyph easthetics, etc.) and take the design decision that makes most sense to you. Just one thing: besides the quite large depth, there's the issue of the descenders being different lengths.

		<div class="commentbody">I think it's just harder to comment on a revival. For example, I think the italics do have a nice structure; they're not 'calligraphic', but on the other hand I think it looks odd (especially when compared to the roman). Maybe because of the weight distribution. <BR> <BR>The figures look very quirky to me, and they're also set too tight (look for '1993' or '1980' in your last sample, for example). <BR> <BR>My point is, these are characteristics that you're bringing from the original typeface, so you'll eventually have to choose between being faithful to the original and adapting it even though it may require you to remove some of its quirks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Forrest,  <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for the insights. I actually kind of like the steep angle on the r, but I will take a look at it and try to improve it. The square brackets are indeed too thin. I have not edited them in a long time and since I made them the rest of the font has become darker and more consistent. So I did revise these to still be thin, but now more in proportion to the rest.  <BR> <BR>Also, good points about the italic. I've been hating the lc k for some time now, but wasn't sure what to do with it. I recently came across a book that was set in Fournier, and seeing how similar it is Marquet in many ways, I decided to adopt a similar style. There was no lc k in the original, so finding this was helpful. I also modified the uc K to be more similar to the R and Q as well. Regarding the y, you are quite right. I would say that overall the spacing on the italic is not very good because I just haven't had the time to do enough work on it. I find that the cursive was easier to draw but more difficult to space! <BR> <BR>After much thought, I also decided to revise the ascenders and descenders to be a bit more conservative. I am still a bit uncomfortable with the ascenders of the longs glyphs, so I will change them to be shaped more like the r. <BR> <BR>I'm also working on expanding the titling set to include a lc that is sort of a blend of the Beaudoire lc and one by Perrin that matches his Titling figures more closely. I will post that in the Display section when more is done. It looks very French!</div>

I have spent countless hours on the titling caps trying to achieve maximum hotness and I really don't think that I can change any of them for the better at this point without disrupting the orignal character.  But I can see that the part you mention declines more swiftly than its P counterpart. I will revisit this letter as I continue to work the display set. I am more sure now that I will want keep these as a separate font altogether rather than put them in the main font as a Titling alternate. <BR> <BR>I am also continually bothered by the italic even after having fixed the k, descenders, etc. That is primarily why I haven't posted any more updates. Lately I have been working on rewriting the opentype code to make it more elegant and to allow for more comprehensive kerning classes on the roman. Once it is figured out how to do this properly, I will apply the same methods to the Italic. And if anybody can tell me how to fix the ugly w, please let me know! <BR> <BR>BTW, Thomas, if you read this, thanks again for posting those OpenType feature files on the Adobe site.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the w and the v are both fine. I had to search through your Hume paper (what did your professor think of the over-the-top typography, by the way?) to find the italic w in a setting, but there it made perfect sense. I think in general this face could stand to be letterspaced a little more loosely, and if so, you could widen the italics a little and lower the contrast. I think my objections to the y would diminish with a little outward curvature in the descender coupled with a thicker stroke. <BR> <BR>I think the italics would be easier to space if the overall letter spacing were looser, too. One of the things I've been learning lately is that we (contemporary users and designers of type) like to bunch our letters up much more tightly than in the past; if this is a revival typeface (which it still kind of is), maybe you should try revival spacing as well.</div>
