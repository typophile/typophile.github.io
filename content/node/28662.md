body: "And now for the second part of my current Type ID problem :-)\r\n\r\nThis handwritten
  script was for \"The Kings: Unstoppable\" album/CD. I'm trying to determine if a
  font was used for this. I have searched hundreds of handwriting fonts, tried Identifont,
  What The Font?, and again looked through quite a few font sites- again, not much
  luck.\r\n\r\nThe CD was released in 1993. The member of the band I spoke with wasn't
  sure if fonts were used or not. Unfortunately it's the highest res version I have
  at this point.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n-Mike\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unstoppable_6602.jpg]"
