  Steve Matteson. The Bertham Pro family includes 4 fonts: the original roman weight
  designed by Frederic W. Goudy\u2019s Bertham and three new styles (bold, italic
  and openface) created by Steve Matteson.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bertham_3912.png]\r\nThe
  Bertham Pro fonts include a variety of OpenType features including swash capitals,
  small capitals and old style figures. Bertham Pro has a distinctive quality that
