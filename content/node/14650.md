  body: "Sorry, but I doubt you'll get much cooperation when looking for free fonts
    here. The only thing I recommend is checking out some of the free fonts distributed
    by foundries and/or the designers that make them (versus a site whose content
    may be pirated or poorly rendered rip-offs). Here are a couple foundries/distrib.
    that are worth looking into*:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.macrhino.com\">Mac Rhino</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/features/free.cfm\">FontShop</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/free.html\">Storm
    Type</a>\r\n\r\n*Please be aware that when using these free fonts, that they are
    still under protection of copyright and license agreements. Each font may have
    a unique set of restrictions (almost always for non-commercial use), so please
    read them carefully.\r\n\r\n(I also realize that my definition of cool might not
    be the type of <cite>cool</cite> you are referring to. :) )\r\n\r\n"

    body: Thank you very much for the advice and the sites. I knew about the agreements
      and copyright situtations which is why I search for royalty free fonts as well
      (which can be really irritating at times...lol)

    create fonts.\r\nYou might want to do a little search around the board, there
    are many great threads about 'getting started'.\r\n\r\nBest of luck."
