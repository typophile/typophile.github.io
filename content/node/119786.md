  Bangla MN Bold, Gurmukhi MN Bold, Kannada MN Bold, Malayalam MN Bold, Oriya MN Bold,
  Sinhala MN Bold \u2014 you get the idea. All these fonts share the same characters
  from ASCII 0 to 128 or so. Then they contain different characters depending on the
  name.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what the original font for all these typefaces is.
  It's not quite Optima, but not quite anything else I know either. What's the nearest
  typeface to this style?"

    these non-Western typefaces turn out to be common serif faces with those serifs
    chopped off.\r\n\r\nI believe we are looking at a version of Times New Roman Bold
    or Extra Bold\u2014minus its serifs.\r\n\r\nA sans serif that comes close is Intrinseca:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/intrinseca/"

  body: Thanks. It's possible, but I'm struggling to imagine a serif-less Times New
    Roman Bold looking close enough to these characters, because all the thin strokes
    would need to be thickened as well. Still, perhaps that's what was done...

  body: Don't know either the origin font of this specific Latin counterpart. Those
    who mimic this style are mainly illegal chopped-off serifs Times or bad attempts
    to create a "Times Sans Serif" ('Times Sans Serif', 'Balham', 'TimesNoRoman'...).
    The only fair sans-serif rework I know is Jason Vandenberg's [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bodoni+sans|Bodoni
    Sans]] but it's obviously not based of Times New Roman.
