  body: "I agree, nice classic font choices. I also like to use fonts (serif and sans
    serif) that have similar weights and form, a common choice of mine is Avenir (sans
    serif for text) and Rockwell (titles), Esta and DinMittleshrift is another.\r\nIt
    makes the overall flow of the text homogeneous."
