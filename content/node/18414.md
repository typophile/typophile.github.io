  body: "Oddly enough, about a year ago, I was doing some informal researching into
    \"Pirate\" looking typefaces and scripts for a children's poster mock-up.  David
    Nalle's site does have several candidates besides Captain Kidd (he has a <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/kidd/index.html\"
    target=\"new\">great web page</a> on the inspiration and development of the face).\r\n\r\nYou
    can also find many \"historic\" styled faces available at  <a href=\"http://www.waldenfont.com\"
    target=\"new\">The Walden Font Co.</a>. By mixing a titling face and \"handwritten\"
    lines here and there, you can emulate an \"old treasure map\" look. Look at their
    \"Divers Handes\" collection for scripts.\r\n\r\nFYI- you might contact them direct
    since they seem to be working on a new \"Nautical Themes\" collection. Maybe you
    can be one of the first users and be truly unique with your project.\r\n\r\nDid
    you see Type Oasis <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/pirates/index.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Pirate & Fonts</a> yet?"

    I was just thinking \"could Terra Nova be a pirate font?\", and i came to the
    conclusion: it could. I just don't know yet whether it's applicable already in
    professional use, but I'll put an update there the next minutes, so you can have
    a look at it.\r\nPossible problems: No bold, no italic, maybe too filigree, and
    never been used in productive systems yet.\r\nPossible pros: made from a map of
    america from 1561 (spaniard), has titling capitals, lots of special characters
    (astrological, astronomical, roman numbers, ligatures, etc.).\r\nIf you want to
    use it, I could produce a version with merged contours and send it to you for
    a try.\r\n\r\nSebilar\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw: Has MVB Sirenne been proposed already?\r\nhttp://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/sirenne/pk_sirenne_text.htm"
