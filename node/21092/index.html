<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I just realized our wedding invites went out with a typo. As a self-proclaimed grammar-tyrant and editing stickler, is it acceptable to kill myself? I can't believed this happened.</div>

<div class=commentbody>lol. Sorry to laugh but i once worked at a print shop on wedding with expensive stock that we had to drill holes for and assemble. There was a typo so she brought them back and we reprinted/ re-drilled/ re-essembled. Then she realized the area code was wrong so we reprinted/ re-drilled/ re-essembled... except we used the pdf with the old typo in it. So we reprinted/ re-drilled/ re-essembled. In otherwords, I've felt your pain, not that it will help u much :P</div>

<div class=commentbody>What kind of a typo--misspelling, misinformation, grammar or puncuation? Most people will tolerate puncuation errors, Example:
I grew up in Poughkeepsie, home of Vassar College and every fall, they would put up a huge banner:
WELCOME
CLASS OF 19XX
And every fall, my father would call them and ask: Where's the comma? And point out that they were an Ivy League school and should know what a parenthetical phrase is. Try getting a birthday cake for this man (we would keep extra tubes of icing so we could add the comma).
I think you better reprint. :)

<div class=commentbody>Mmm. My first year editing the cegep "Arts Journal", I was also doing a lot of the layout preparation which involved re-typing some of the stuff that had been submitted on paper. Oh, and proofreading, too. We were only 4 people, so everyone did everything.
Anyway, I also included one of my own poems in it.
After printing, and distributing copies, and getting up at the podium to read at our launch, I noticed right there in the first line of my poem, a massive typo. The kind that's worse because it becomes another word that you didn't mean at all. I forget what it was now, but realized my mistake and knew I had done it as I was reading to the audience.
At least it was in my poem and not someone else's.
