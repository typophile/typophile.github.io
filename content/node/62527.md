  | Allumi PTF]] is a different font. Different from anything I have has designed
  in the past. Allumi PTF is a sleek typeface designed with technology in mind.\r\n\LIt\u2019s
  a perfect font family for any communication concerning design, robotics, or functionality.
  Pushed to its extreme limits, the Allumi PTF shapes are neither perfectly round
  or geometrically square. It\u2019s a human design with a high tech touch. Allumi
  PTF can be described as the Eurostyle (designed by Aldo Novarese in 1962) of the
  new century, mixed with Frutiger. Allumi is a serious typeface because of the unique
  design and sturdy form. The pure shapes can create a global presence today with
  an eye on the world of tomorrow.\r\n\LEach series features a full glyph set which
  covers most latin languages and includes all aspects of typographic needs such small
  caps, various set of figures & so on. In addition, with the use of some alternate
  glyphs, the overall aspect of text setting can change. Last but not least, more
  than 70 dingbats are included and adapted for the 9 series.\r\n\r\n<em>Jean Fran\xE7ois

    Obviously this was considered in the process (at least to an extent, with the
    reference of Eurostyle), but the high-tech vibe I pick up on is really that of
    a technology of the past \u2014 an industrial, tactile tech more than a digital,
    bleep-bleep tech. But nonetheless it seems to work in this age too, and because
    of that fusion I love it. Can\u2019t wait to see it in action!"
