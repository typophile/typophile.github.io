  body: "Hello from Trek in Waterloo, Wisconsin. I have some additional info that
    you may find interesting:\r\n\r\nThe wordmark in the decals above appeared on
    the very first Trek steel bicycle frames that were hand-built in Waterloo in 1976.
    Over the next several years this type treatment could be found on the top tube
    and seat tube decals, some seat stay cap wraparounds and the head tube badge (without
    the shadow). This of course predates the digitization of <em>Premier Shaded</em>
    by Eisner+Flake. However, <em>Premier Shaded</em> was originally designed by British
    typographer Colin Brignall for <a href=\"http://www.letraset.com/design/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=307&cat=Premier+Shaded\">Letraset</a>
    transfer sheets in 1969 or 1970 (depending on who you ask).\r\n\r\nThe comparison
    below shows that while the Trek wordmark was inspired greatly by <em>Premier Shaded</em>,
    it was in fact customized type meant to soften some of the art deco qualities
    found in its muse:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trek_5987.png]"
