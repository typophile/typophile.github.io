  font when it becomes available in September. \r\n\r\nHowever, we need to create
  some mock-ups within the next week. Can you suggest a font we can purchase that
  has a similar flavor? I have e-mailed Ale to get his suggestions. \r\n\r\nHere is
  a sample that Ale posted on his flickr page http://www.flickr.com/photos/17849178@N00/3116204649/sizes/o/\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Semilla_4582.jpg]"

    look over their website at http://www.sudtipos.com/home to see what else is available
    that might be close enough for your mock-up.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    somewhat similar in weight and feel (of course, I know this is a very subjective
    judgement).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Kristen, isn't Ale willing to help you out with a pre-release? A beta version
    or something?
