    looking at the \"h\" you can tell they started with a Real Font and mutilated
    it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Agree, don't think it's font too, obviously edited. \r\nFor what it's forth,
    if you need to reproduce it, I would suggest to focus on the /e which I decided
    to consider as the only letter untouched. You could start, for instance, with
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/|Proxima Nova]] (which
    has avery similar, if not matching, /e), keeping the /ihcove and recreating all
    the rest with a /o."

  body: Hi, I'm a designer at Brightcove. The type is fully custom and was done by
    the identity designer who created the logo. Gotham was his starting point for
    that, as it is our corporate typeface. You can see the influence in the t, c and
    e letterforms in particular.

  body: "Would you like a type designer to fix it up a bit? For example make the \"b\"
    and \"g\" look as nice as the \"h\". Also, the straight-to-curve transitions are
    suffering from a classic problem called the \"bone effect\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
