body: 'I see Tamye Riggs has posted the availabilty of the FontAid fleurons font at:
  &#60;<a href="http://typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?72/72.html" target="_blank">http://typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?72/72.html</a>&#62;
  <BR>The font is only $20 and is sent as a donation to relief efforts for Tsunami
  victims.  There is also a place to contribute more if you like.   <BR>The font itself
  is a gem. I am sure everyone will have their favorites but my 5 favorites were designed
  by: Ko Sliggers, Lukasz Dziedzic, Magda Frankowska, Stefan Hattenbach, and Will
  Price. <BR>I won&#39;t post any GIFs but anyone who buys the font will be able to
  see my favs and find many of their own &#40;that was a sales pitch&#41;. If you
  buy the font, then you get to post your thoughts on how your favs are at least as
  good as the 5 above--and you would have contributed to the Tsunami victims. <BR>Thanks
  to Jim Richardson, SOTA, and everyone else involved in puting this [project together.

  body: I was really impressed with the variety of fleurons - and was pleased to see
    my own, the lower case &#34;x&#34; image made up of repeating palm trees, included.  I&#39;m
    looking forward to seeing the Building Letters publication of the images in color
    as well. <BR> <BR>- Jeff
