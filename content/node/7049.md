    type surrounding the australian date is plain old helvetica. Lay the whole thing
    out. Print and photocopy several times. Light contrast, then dark. Scan back in.
    Voila! Any sans will do. Tip: you can even rotate the photocopy slightly while
    the light is passing by to give that rolled stamp look.'

  body: I would avoid italicizing the text, as you&#39;ll rarely see that style of
    type used on passport stamps. You also might want to look at roughening up the
    edges of the text a bit more to simulate the rubber stamp look. Yves posted <a
    href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10551.html">this tutorial</a>
    a while back. It may give you some ideas.

  body: Just caught that Rubber Stamp Tutorial that Yves posted, great stuff... any
    ideas for &#34;cut up&#34; effects?  They&#39;re everywhere nowadays on &#34;vintage&#34;
    shirts... but I just don&#39;t know how it&#39;s done.  Any more help Yves?  If
    you need a sample I can post one up.  Maybe this should go in its own forum?

  body: Lissenup, as I told in my &#34;tutorial&#34;, this is a ten year old trick.  <BR>Which
    version of Photoshop would that have been? 2? 3? <BR>I&#39;m sure the multitude
    of available filters and effects in the  <BR>current version can get you there
    a lot easier and faster. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
