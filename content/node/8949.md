  long period of time. <BR>No one seems to know what any of them are, and I&#39;m
  having no luck in finding the names of them. <BR>I appreciate any help. Thanks!

  body: I have also looked for Number 4, but that looks like a home-made script font
    &#40;amateur&#41;. All bets are off about finding any of those. I went through
    the Script Guide section that has styles like that &#40;Part 9, Everyday Handwriting&#41;
    and no luck there. This sort of font could easily be one-of-a-kind.

    Sure fooled me! :-D <BR>Thanks for all of the help! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Well, 4 should be a font, the lowercase a&#39;s are all alike.  But, the real
    problem is finding the right one.  Take a look over at <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=603&amp;page=1&amp;nb_ppp_old=10&amp;text=light+as+an+angel+feather&amp;nb_ppp=10&amp;classt=alpha"

  body: '#4 is indeed a font, after all! Not at dafont, though. I just checked through
    the whole section &#40;suggested by Ryan&#41;, and came up with nothing. Then
    I remembered fontgarden&#39;s gallery &#40;found at fontgarden.com&#41;...since
    there are tons of script handwriting fonts there, I thought I should at least
    find something similar. And voila! Not similar, but exact: Cindywrite. <BR>Thought
    I would share, in case anyone else was wondering <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>Well, that&#39;s two down...and I wonder if #2 is
    actually a font, too. I do really hope the first one is a font, that&#39;s the
    main one I&#39;m hunting :-D'

  body: 'Just wanted to be clear that what I said about Number 4 was that it was an
    &#39;amateur font&#39;. I didn&#39;t mean to create the impression that it wasn&#39;t
    a font.  <BR> <BR>The problem with identifying fonts like that is that you have
    to be lucky to find them in most cases, unless they are VERY popular, or very
    distinctive. I appreciate knowing about the Fontgarden site, because I now know
    a good place to refer people who have a quest like the one you were on. <BR> <BR>There
    are too many of those home-made fonts to possibly catalog them all, so I think
    you were lucky to have spotted that one in their collection. <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    sharing what you found. <BR> <BR>As for your #1 font. Have you looked at some
    of the scrapbooking sites? I have seen some fancied-up fonts like that at Letteringdelights.com,
    but be warned that you have to wait a while for the catalog  pages to download.'

  body: The more I look at it, Number 2 may be a &#34;grunge&#34; font made by appying
    filters to Verdana in some way. I notice that the patterns in the E&#39;s and
    R&#39;s match. It doesn&#39;t necessarilly mean it <b>is</b> a font, but it&#39;s
    possible.

  body: Mike- Right, my mistake :-D After you said if it was a font, it was an amateur
    font, I assumed that if it was a font, it was one that somebody had made of their
    own handwriting &#40;aka a personal font and not distributed&#41;. Your welcome
    for the link, and hopefully it can help others in the future. There are some pretty
    neat script/handwriting fonts there. Thanks for the scrapbooking link, I will
    check that out <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Patricia- Thanks, I hadn&#39;t even noticed. Turns out to be
    someone that actually referred me here :-D <BR> <BR>Mark- With my luck, it probably
    is just some clever letter manipulating, but hopefully it is a font -crosses fingers-.
    <BR> <BR>Ryan- Thank you, I&#39;ll have a look <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
