  a western film that is set in an arabic country. I'm thinking of going down two
  paths of either choosing a sans serif face that has a real international feel to
  it, perhaps something condensed and then using arabic characters as textural elements
  throughout the sequence or trying to source a latin face that is arabic influenced.
  This could either be achieved my manually adding details to an existing face but
  I think the sheer volume of type rules this one out which leaves me to find that
  elusive face.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I have come across that is even remotely close
  is T26 regallo \r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/fontsearch.php?q=regallo&ss=2 \r\n\r\nThis
  could only work as a main title and it isn't quite what I had in mind.\r\n\r\nI
  came across the work of Tarek Atrissi, an Arabic Graphic Designer. He has designed
  some great arabic faces. I've attached a couple of screenshots of Arabic faces he
  has developed. Can anyone suggest a latin face that achieves the feel that either
  of these do and ideally introduces some of the accenting and detailing used in arabic
  typography.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/al-ghad_5554.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/artrissi_4656.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help on this one."

  body: "Yes, an enviable project!\r\n\r\nA variant/hybrid of your ideas would be
    to use a Latin face -I'd say one that's actually not international and narrow
    but calligraphic and wide- and judiciously add the floating marks characteristic
    of Arabic, especially the more elaborate ones like the shadda (also called the
    tashdeed) the hamza the sekoon and the dammtayn. And if you could sneak in some
    kasheedas (the lengthenings of the horizontal bars within words) that would be
    great - although you'd need a script (and of a certain horizontal rigidity) to
    pull that off. Maybe Linoscript? Hmmm, that certainly has a French-colonial mien
    that might be an interesting spin here. But you said the movie is a western.\r\n\r\nRegallo
    seems too nuts and not Arabic enough. If you enter \"Arabic\" into MyFonts's search
    you'll find many designs along those lines that would be better - although many
    of them are a bit too cartoony for my own tastes. Simran is a nice one - although
    maybe more Devanagari than Arabic.\r\n\r\nPoppl has designed an all-caps face
    called Saladin -with an Arabic Kufi feel- that might work: http://typophile.com/node/28272
    _\r\nHere's its digital revival: http://www.canadatype.com/showfont.php?id=99\r\n\r\nAs
    for Tarek's work, it is indeed distinguished, and seems in some cases inspired
    by existing Latin fonts, but you might still have a tough time finding a match
    close enough to intermix seamlessly. Go ahead and ask Tarek directly though! He's
    very approachable. Maybe some custom font modification is on your horizon.\r\n\r\nOh,
    or you could use this -pardon my language- goddam amazing piece of work:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/4383

    rather than \"western\". Eg Table Manners.\r\nGratuitous accents would only make
    it look metal.\r\n\r\nHow about a very heavy (slab) serif italic, with a scriptish
    flair, like Korinna Kursiv Heavy or Usherwood Black Italic?\r\n\r\nFor a script
    font, the classic Legend(e)?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/legende/"

    Western as in \"For a Few Camels More\" or as in not Eastern? \r\n\r\nLove the

    a bit quick from the readability point of view. In any case, that girl deserves

    has a super eastern look to a western eye, but looking at your suggestions I could
    be way off brief - or it may be a little bit \"done before\" for you.\r\n\r\nIs
    there a working title to play with?"
