  body: 'Thank you! I live in Sweden and when the 3 company was introduced they used
    the Verona typeface in very clean ads. Just big black text on a white background.
    I don''t know if this was the same in other countries. It was probably the most
    distinctive advertising campaign I''ve seen with only sleek typography as the
    main idea. Now they have "polluted" their graphical image with a lot of colours
    and crowded ads. '
