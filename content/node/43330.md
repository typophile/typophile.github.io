  or picture) and are symbols, logos, line drawings, fleurons, etc.\r\n\r\nI don't
  know if there is a name for a font:\r\n(a) that has picture elements in it, i.e.,
  letters that include hearts, flowers, flames, stars, etc.\r\n(b) that uses symbols
  to form letters, e.g., Toolbox, Critter, Cutout, etc.\r\n\r\nIf there is a term
  for either or both of these kinds of fonts, please enlighten me. (I'm looking for
  something beyond, \"Yeah, bad fonts!)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    guess you will have to go on a hunt :) - Try the freefonts sites, just google

  body: "I've been calling these \"picture element fonts\" because I didn't know what
    they were called. When someone asked me about them, I felt embarrassed because
    I didn't know what the \"correct\" name was, assuming there was a label for these
    kinds of fonts. \r\n\r\nI Googled \"novelty fonts\" and came up with this site
    http://ingrimayne.com/fonts2/_noveltya.html that referred to \"fonts in which
    the letters are made from things, from paper clips to bugs to tools\" as letterbat
    fonts, which I had heard of a long time ago but didn't remember.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Nick that there is a distinction between letters that are made of things,
    like tools, and fonts that are embellished with vines, hearts, stars, etc.  I'm
    not sure I like rebus fonts; that reminds me of the game (show) \"Win, Lose, or
    Draw,\" or Pictionary.\r\n\r\nSo far, I like Novelty, Picture fonts, and Pi letters,
    letterbats, embellished fonts, decorated fonts. I even found dinglets and dingfonts
    in a Google search! \r\n\r\nThis probably doesn't interest the pros who set type
    or do layouts for magazines, advertisements, newspapers, brochures, etc. But every
    once in a while it's nice to use fun fonts. Even though  Judith Sutcliffe's Hibiscus
    is not very much liked by professional types, I once saw it used in a travel advertisement.
    And I'm sure more than one restaurant has used a font embellished with chili peppers.
    And yes, some of these fonts shouldn't ever see the light of day again (e.g.,
    fonts made out of spermatozoon, poop, etc). Whether we like or hate all or some
    or none of them, why shouldn't there be a taxonomy of even these fonts?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    we should have a contest!\r\n\r\n\u2022 Fonts with each letter made of a different
    element (different tools, musical istruments, animals)\r\n\u2022 Fonts with each
    letter made of a common element (nails, logs, barbed wire, typewriter keys, paper
    clips, bamboo, people in different poses)\r\n\u2022 Fonts with letters embelished
    with picture elements (hearts, flowers, stars, eyeballs, bees, bugs, vines)\r\n\u2022
    Fonts with letters inside a picture element (animals, soldiers, trains, blocks,
    baloons, pumpkins, footprints, leaves) \r\n\r\nEven if this doesn't go any further,
    I thank those of you who uderstood my question --  and contributed ideas, comments,
    suggestions, and answers."

  body: "I think all font designers are familiar with suggestions from non-designers
    such as: why don't you make a font with letters made of puppies, hot dogs, naked
    people etc. Of all the terms I've heard, \"theme fonts\" seems to the most obvious
    and many font sites categorize them that way. I don't see how splitting into abstract
    sub-genres would increase clarity. Functionally, Ch's categories all function
    the same way. In a railway theme font: railway cars with letters on them, letters
    made of tracks, or letters that look like railway cars all perform the same basic
    function. Choosing one over another is just a matter of taste\r\n\r\nConcrete
    subgenres are self-evident. Flower theme fonts, footprint theme fonts, feces theme
    fonts etc."

    is traditional, but makes about as much sense as \"miscellaneous\" or \"other\"
    or \"bizarre\" or \"unusual\". It just says the fonts look... different. \"Theme\"
    goes more to the intention of the designer. \r\n\r\nI've also seen decorated fonts
    (basically normal letters with other stuff added) called \"florid\" or \"floriated\",
    although that seems to imply only flower-like additions."
