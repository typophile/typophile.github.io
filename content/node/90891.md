body: "Sorry to post something as trivial as this, but I have been racking my brain
  and searching google for 1.5 hrs and I'm not coming up with anything.\r\n\r\nIm
  trying to remember a website that showcased fonts. I can describe it like this:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  I think it is a personal blog, so it will be www.Name-Of-Person.com/finefonts\r\n\r\n\u2022
  I think the name of that section of his site is something like \"fine fonts\" or
  something with alliteration. At least I think it was 2 words. Maybe \"Nice Type\"
  or something like that.\r\n\r\n\u2022 each \"post\" of his \"blog\" featured one
  font only and there was a giant character in that typeface somewhere in the background.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  each \"post\" used a different color combination, vary nice combinations if I remember.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  I can't be sure, but I think all the fonts featured were free ones\r\n\r\n\u2022
  the pages linked out to the foundries or the respective download pages.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sorry I can't offer more, but I'm hoping someone in this community can point me
  in the right direction. Thanks!"

    wink didn't give that away?? You were correct though, the site name <em>does</em>
    alliterate.\r\n\r\nAnd it's a very nice site too, thanks (nevertheless) for pointing
    it out."

    on you. I just have this thing when people are overly pedantic and unhelpful.\r\n\r\n(My
    assumption is that this person is trying to self aggrandize by pointing out meaningless
    flaws.)\r\n\r\nI need to work on that."
