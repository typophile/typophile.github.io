body: Can anyone shed some light on when the Scangraphic phototype library was digitized?
  Any history on the foundry would also be appreciated. Thanks.

  body: "I've read that statement, which is similar to the one on their website. It
    seems to imply that their typefaces were developed for phototypesetting (non-digital)
    beginning in 1980. Is this a correct interpretation?\r\n\r\nFurther, were there
    any digital SG fonts prior to 2004 or was this the first time the SG fonts were
    digitized?"

  body: 1992 ... That's interesting. Thanks for the information, guys. I wonder if
    there's a list of their entire catalog from 1992 somewhere. Perhaps someone from
    Elsner+Flake should know. Thanks again.

    body: "There were Scangraphic specimen books around in the early 1990s. Somewhere
      I have a set, one with black covers, the other with white. I don\u2019t remember
      for sure what the difference was, but perhaps one was for the proprietary library,
      the other for desktop (Type 1) offerings. (Or maybe film and digital.)\r\n\r\nLater,
      the company exhibited for a year or two at either Seybold or MacWorld, and gave
      away a smaller book of one-line showings of fonts available in PostScript Type
      1. (All this is from memory; can\u2019t find the books right now.)\r\n\r\nFontHaus
      used to sell Scangraphic fonts; I have Zapf Renaissance and Today Sans from
      that period.\r\n\r\n-- Kathleen"

  body: "Scangraphic fonts were digitized on Ikaurs equipment in close collaboration
    with URW in the 1980s. Scangraphic is based in Hamburg, just like Elsner+Flake
    and URW++, and the activities of the companies are somehow interconnected. Veronika
    Elsner, now co-head of Elsner+Flake, was the first type designer who worked at
    URW (she was hired by Peter Karow in 1975 or so). Jelle Bosma (now Monotype Imaging)
    worked at Scangraphic when the company digitized their type collection. The Scangraphic
    fonts were converted to Type 1 about 1992 and used to be sold via some channels
    mentioned above. Since Scangraphic literally abandoned the font business, last
    year Elsner+Flake has taken over their font collection. They added Euro characters
    to all the fonts, remastered them, re-issued in Type 1 format and additionally
    published in OpenType PS format. \r\n\r\nAdam"
