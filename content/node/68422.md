body: "Last year, when the first Taschen book \"A Visual History of Typefaces and
  Graphic Styles, Vol. 1\" popped up on an Amazon ad, I bought it immediately. After
  coveting it in close proximity, pouring over beautiful pages, I knew I was smitten.
  Shortly thereafter, the second volume appeared for preorder and I could not resist
  temptation. Yesterday, volume 2 arrived and did not dissapoint.\r\n\r\nI opened
  the book and that wonderful smell that says \"Book\" tickled my nasal passages.
  I felt like I had just sat down at the rare book section of the New York Public
  Library in Manhattan. It doesn't smell like book as in \"Barnes & Noble store at
  the Mall\", it smells like loved and cared for printing and typography with lucious
  plates of books gone by.\r\n\r\nIf you are the typical person who visits Typophile,
  you will surely love these two volumes as visual, verbal, and olfactory treasure
  troves.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.amazon.com/Type-Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic/dp/3836511010/ref=pd_sim_b_1\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic-1901-1938/dp/3836515148/ref=pd_rhf_p_img_2\r\n\r\n"

    the new edition, and covet it too. Nice to know that if I buy them (I don't have
    the first volume yet) they won't stink up my place!\r\n\r\nThanks for the recommendation.\r\n"
