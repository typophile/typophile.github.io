  body: "Dear typophiles\r\n\r\nThanks for all your suggestions. An the name of the
    baby is:\r\n\r\n<em>Sintesi. Sans meets serif. </em>\r\n\r\nYou would like to
    express tradition by using a contemporary font? Sintesi might be exactly what
    you are looking for. \r\n\r\n\r\nSintesi stands for synthesis \u2013 the unification
    of serif and sans-serif into a contemporary font, which surprises with different
    facets depending on its application. \r\n\r\nIn copy size Sintesi performs like
    a sans-serif. It is a compact and well readable font that fulfils all requirements
    of modern digital media. \r\n\r\nIn larger sizes, Sintesi unfolds its traditional
    character. Now, its strong contrast and the perceptible feather-ductus stand out
    clearly, as we appreciate it in a historical old style face. \r\n\r\nSintesi is
    completed by a suitable italic. Its cursive character has more to do with writing-speed
    than to its moderate inclination. Therefore Sintesi may be well-suited for many
    other purposes, not only for emphasising purposes.\r\n \r\nThe whole font family
    consists of 20 styles and offers a wide range of Western and Eastern European
    special characters, typographical ligatures, uppercase, oldstyle and fraction
    figures.\r\n\r\nStart combining antiquity with modernity!\r\nDownload a free trial
    version of Sintesi with a reduced character set: www.sintesi.ch \u2013 check it
    out!\r\n"
