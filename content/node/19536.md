  if alternate characters or stylistic sets are supported (aside from the Glyph palette)
  for OT fonts? It seems not, but maybe I'm missing something."

    it. it seems Quark is just planning to catch up to the OT support available in
    InDesign CS1"

  body: Bummer. A lot of people who have licensed Proxima Nova have told me they did
    so because of the alternate characters. I've been telling Quark users that I expect
    support for alternate characters in Quark 7. Grr.

    body: it is a bummer because I see quark going out.  I loved quark for a long
      time and turned my shoulder to InDesign.  Now that I have actually used Indesign,
      I will never go back.  Far more user friendly in my opinion and does everything
      quark does and more.  How can they compete? Opinions?

  body: The only bummer is that people still use Quark (esp. with that new heinous
    logo).
