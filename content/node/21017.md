  Ben Kiel while on a tour of the type-savy land of the Dutch. The glyph reminds me
  of the Renaissance born symbol for addition; representing the first letter of the
  word pi\xFA or plus. Alternatively, it could be a fancy way of depicting a new paragraph.
  Any thoughts?"

    how it's called or what is meant to represent, tho :( . Can anyone enlighten us

    ... sorry.\r\n\r\nIt took a bit of searching but I found the image my mind was
    relating to Ben's picture. The symbol for addition (attached image) is really
    different. oops. I don't know what I was thinking ... and yes it would be a p-shape;
    at the hour I was thinking of this, I neglected to reverse the original. Thanks
    for the moment of clarity. \r\n\r\nMiguel, do you think it's a '\xBF' \u2026?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/symbols_4647.png]"

    not at all. I believe that glyph was put in INVERTED QUESTION MARK (U+00BF) on
    1530 Garamond Archaics due to the lack of a better place. In fact, there's not
    really a proper place as I think Unicode does not have code points for a lot of
    the glyphs present in that font.\r\n\r\n> <em>Yes, this would be a glyph ID I

    there's not really a proper forum for glyph ID either :^D"

    body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm new here, but may be a little bit of help.\r\n\r\nThe
      glyph is an abbreviation of the latin suffix -que (meaning and). In old fonts
      the may be up to 3 or more different forms of this abbreviation. This kind of
      abbreviation was used in prints till the end of the 16. century (maybe a bit
      longer).\r\n\r\nWolfgang"

    on the left is another abbreviation with a p. perhaps it's for <em>per</em>?

      and Italian abbreviations of the middle ages by Adriano Capelli. It covers about14000
      forms. Although this book is about manuscript abbreviations it covers all the
      forms used in print \u2013 as those are derived from the manuscript ones.\r\n\r\nhttp://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibProduction/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/cappelli.html
