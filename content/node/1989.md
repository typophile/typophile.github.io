  long it took from Gutenberg invented the &#40;first commercially successful moveable
  type&#41; printing press until various useable features were introduced.  I used
  to have references that covered this, but I can&#39;t find it anywhere. <BR> <BR>when
  was variable witdh spacing introduced &#40;rather than cutting types in varying
  widhts as Gutenberg did&#41;? <BR> <BR>when was paragrpah indent and newline introduced
  &#40;rather than separating paragraphs by paragraph marks&#41;? <BR> <BR>any other
  noticable inventions that should be mentioned? <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR>                       '

    think the answer to this has been found. But the question has always been posed
    in the reverse: When did the early printers stop casting type in varying widths
    &#40;as a means of adjusting spacing&#41;? From what I remember about it, the
    non-affiliated foundry, and the beginning of standardization, occurs very early
    in the 1600s. That, in itself, would have ensured the necessity for variable width
    spacing. Not sure if Harry Carter discusses this in his _A View of Early Typography_,
    but this might be a good source to reference in answering some of your questions.
