    V is pointy, rather than squared off...\r\n\r\nIt may be something that the artist
    hand renders?\r\n"

  body: I remember speaking with someone in Michael's studio a couple of years ago.
    I seem to recall the he renders it by hand.

  body: "I could have sworn that Michael made his (custom designed) typeface commercially
    available at one point. I have this vague and unconfirmed memory of seeing it
    in a little box (back in the days of floppy disks) on a shelf at store called
    Builder's Booksource in Berkeley. I've never seen it or any reference to it since,
    and now wonder if I imagined the whole thing.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know?\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    Eagle seems to be the closest match."
