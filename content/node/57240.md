  kottke.org some time ago. Peter Saville has various fonts used for his New Order
  album sleeves up for download on his site. \r\nI can't imagine these are anything
  more than slight tweaks to existing faces. There's no EULA or anything, and I can't
  find much more info about it.\r\nJust curious, i guess...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd stay away from those fonts if I were you. Saville wasn't really much
    of a font guy anyway. Most of what is on that page is incorrect or poorly wrought.\r\n\r\nIn
    the case of the Closer font, it is both. That's not the font. And in fact, that's
    not even the proper name of that font that has been modified. They didn't even
    bother changing the copyright.\r\n\r\nI'm still in the process of digitizing the
    Closer font, see [[http://typophile.com/node/41650|this thread]]."

  body: "Thanks Dan. Just found [[http://typophile.com/node/4549|this]] older thread
    with Brett Wickens discussing some of his work on Crouwel's New Alphabet. From
    what I gather that site must be some sort of fan site.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nJust got
    a chance to catch up on reading your Closer thread. It looks great! How's progress
    going?"

  body: "I haven't messed with it much. It works sufficient for me, but I'd like to
    clean it up significantly before I offer it out. I'd also like to complete the
    character set, do some spacing, etc.\r\n\r\nI'll have to finish it off sometime
    though. Maybe I'll start working on it again."
