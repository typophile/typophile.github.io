body: "Does anyone use Tahoma, particularly for html text?\r\n\r\nI know it's a slender
  cousin of Verdana.  What I don't know is why it does not have italics, or at least
  obliques. I almost prefer its tighter spacing and a narrower footprint than Verdana,
  although it may be too tight for on-screen use.  Not sure if it translates well
  in the PC version either -- is it fully hinted?\r\n\r\nI was hoping anyone (sii?)
  could explain why Microsoft and/or Mr. Carter appear to have left it unfinished."

  body: "One more thing...\r\n\r\nPart of my reason for bringing this up is the popularity
    of TrebuchetMS, especially with the blogging set.  I'm just not a fan of its perkiness
    and would love an alternative with a similar width.  Tahoma seems like the only
    other web-friendly alternative."

  body: "Tahoma was created as a user interface font. \r\n\r\nIt was designed with
    button text, icon labels and small passages of text in mind (error messages and
    dialogs) and targeted a small range of type sizes rendered bi-level (not for antialiased
    rendering or the not-yet invented ClearType). It was hinted to the same level
    as Verdana. The character set is much larger than Verdana and includes Hebrew,
    Thai, Arabic, extended Latin and extended Cyrillic\r\n\r\nWhen we first saw it
    being used for continuous text on web pages we did cringe but it's use is so prevalent
    now that I guess everyone has got used to it. Also I think the regular renders
    pretty well under ClearType (not true for the bold) which helps. \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si\r\n"

    body: True, Verdana is better - hence it being a "Web font" and not a UI font.

    Are these working fine under new Flash?

  body: "Tahoma was first made and was suppose to be used to replace MS Sans in the
    UI of Windows but wasn't used because of the need to exactly match all the widths
    of the existing UI font. Then it was decided to use a more expanded font. So Matthew
    made one a bit more normally spaced and it was made for the Web and not the UI.
    \r\n\r\nI made the embedded bitmaps for Tahoma and then instructed Tom Rickner
    a bit what to do to match the widths and shape of the embedded bitmaps. \r\n\r\nThen
    after that I was told to make another web font so I made Trebuchet. And I was
    very conscience not to copy the shapes Matthew made (or such as the ascender height
    (added one pixel) lowercase 'l' (added the hook) the UK 'M' had to add the flares
    since his was straight and a different LC 'e' and 'g' and basically made different
    bitmaps at a very low resolution at 9..13 pixels per EM the target screen resolutions.
    \r\n\r\nSo they are all about the same and I had a hand in the developement and
    hinting of Tahoma, Verdana and Trebuchet but really only get credit for Trebuchet...
    Oh well got paid in the end anyway.\r\n\r\n"

    then :op ... its not just tighter than verdana but kindof ugly as well when used

    tahoma is great for navigation or areas where you have \"no space\" to work with,
    times when verdana would seems unbelievably wide."
