  body: 'WGL4 is a Microsoft character set specification. It&#39;s not an encoding,
    and it&#39;s not specific to OpenType. It is however specific to Unicode &#40;a
    Type 1 font with WGL4 character set would be possible, but pretty useless&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Essentially, WGL4 includes the following Windows codepages: <BR>- Western
    &#40;WinANSI&#41; <BR>- Eastern Europe <BR>- Turkish <BR>- Baltic <BR>- Greek
    <BR>- Cyrillic <BR> <BR>It also includes some additional extended Latin characters
    not present in the Latin codepages above, and a whole section of IBM linedraw
    characters. <BR> <BR>So to build a WGL4 font, you can use the MS spec you cite,
    build it in either TTF or OTF &#40;OpenType CFF&#41; format, and mark the font
    as supporting those 4 codepages &#40;plus whatever additional DOS or Mac codepages
    are appropriate&#41;. <BR> <BR>T'

  body: WGL4 should be seen as a kind of transitional character subset, somewhere
    between the fixed sets of 8-bit codepages and free ranging in Unicode. It represents
    Microsofts attempt, at a particular time, to define an internal character set
    that would reliably support a specific set of languages &#40;official, major and
    other well-documented European languages in the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts&#41;,
    which could be specified as a procurement set by different groups within MS and
    which would be reliably covered in MS core fonts. <BR> <BR>WGL4 is now a bit out
    of date, and I&#39;m cautious about recommending it as a base for new font development.
    It is missing four Cyrillic characters that were added to Unicode at the request
    of the Macedonian government after WGL4 was defined; it contains at least a couple
    of obsolete characters that are no longer in use &#40;e.g. the Greenlandic <i>kra</i>
    which has not been part of the Greenlandic alphabet since the 1970s&#41;. The
    obsolete characters are not a big problem, since it does not harm to include them
    and historical documents containing them might need to be encoded, but the missing
    characters are a problem. <BR> <BR>Also note that there is a core set of WGL4
    which consists of specific codepage support, as noted by Thomas above, and it
    may be possible to talk your customer into supporting this without needing to
    add all the IBM linedraw characters which fill out the larger WGL4 set.

    <BR>I figured as much as it was an extended set. Strangely enough the customer
    specified that the just wanted the standrad set AND WGL4  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have
    to get back to them on that ;&#41; <BR> <BR>/peter <BR>&#60;/font&#62;'
