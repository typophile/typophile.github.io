		<div class="commentbody">Don't be such Modernists, guys. Lynn's question is&hellip; <i>real</i>. It doesn't have a answer like &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot; but there's a fuzzy reality there, and if we think objectively and pragmatically, we can help. She's probably looking for trends, not The Answer. <BR> <BR>Look at the fonts in tipoGrafica #60. As a group, they're turn-of-the-century (I mean this last one) South American. Look at the stuff in FontFont: as a group, they're very European. Look at Emigre: they're highly Californian. <BR> <BR>It's somewhat hard to imagine FF Signa for example being designed outside of Northern Europe. Yes, it's not impossible, but the <i>trend</i> is there. Otherwise we wouldn't have differences in culture around the globe. And it would be hard to imagine some of Martinez Meave's fonts being designed outside even <i>Mexico</i>, not even the broader Latin America. And then look at Franklin Gothic, then look at Univers. <BR> <BR>Don't be afraid of tangible -if hazy- variance. To paraphrase Jerome Peignot: let's celebrate our differences. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I usually feel awkward when these discussions appear because they tend to go all stereotypical when it comes to what a country 'is' and what it represents.

		<div class="commentbody">Fredrik, it certainly is &quot;dangerous&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>On the other hand&hellip;</i> <BR>If a typeface is widely exposed, during a long time (like Johnstons London Underground) you might feel it becomes part of a city, or a country. <BR>Bliss, yes I do feel it's english typographic roots, but I also feel it's a bit swedish beacuse it's frequently used by the biggest mobile operator in the country (maybe Scandinavia as well, it's Telia). <BR> <BR>When i see FF Signa I see something danish, actually.  <BR>Because of danish type tradition, from Knud V Engelhardt to DSB (Danish State Railways) corporate identity and typeface, designed by danish design agency Kontrapunkt. And the DSB type is displayed everywhere you travel (in Denmark).  <BR>So there's a style associated with Denmark, but I wonder, how close is a country's <i>visual</i> identity to it's soul? If countries have souls, that is. Or a whole bunch together like Europe for that matter.  <BR>I'm sceptical&hellip;  <BR> <BR>I'll end this post as I noticed Alessandro did on another thread with a verse from a song.  <BR>From <i>Cold Swedish Winter</i> by Jens Lekman: <BR> <BR><i>When people think of Sweden i think they get the wrong idea, <BR>Like Cliff Richard who thought it was just porn and gonorrhea; <BR>and Lou Reed said in the film</i> Blue in the face <BR><i>that compared to New York City Sweden was a scary place. <BR>They seemed to have a point after meeting with this girl&hellip; <BR>maybe not Cliff Richard, but Lou had surely met her.</i> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mea culpa. I can't keep up with you youngsters and the zillion computer faces you refer to. When I was setting type on Berthold equipment, I thought that their Concorde was a very classy face with a European flavor. Any of the Gill family say the London Tube stations and markings. Akzidenz Grotesk and Microgramma are other sans serifs. Clarendon and C. Bold were very common in Switzerland, though it's American in style. Hope this helps. <BR>PG <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/" target="_blank"><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/">http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/</a></a></div>
