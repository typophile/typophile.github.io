body: "Hy everybody\r\n\r\nI am a design student, looking for some help for my next
  project. We have to do a book as an \"hommage to typography\" and it ocurred me
  that I wanna do a collectable piece, honouring the most beautiful designs of each
  letter. In other words, let me explain it like that: We all know, that Spiekermanns
  \"Meta\" has an especially fascinating lower case \"g\". I'm looking for the missing
  pieces of the alphabet. Which font, in your opinion, has the most beautiful sans
  serif lower case \"o\", for example? Or the most beautiful sans serif upper case
  \"A\"? I would be glad for your help and some inspirations. I'm looking exclusively
  for sans serif font, though the idea is to make a serie out of the books (most beautiful
  sans serif characters, most beautiful serif caracters, ect.) and it doesn't matter
  if lower- or upper case.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nSandra."

  body: "Maybe /A/ from a very bold weight of Univers? Though it might only seem beautiful
    for being clever, and only seem clever in conjunction with the other characters,
    as intended. This might be a problem with your concept because seeing the characters
    in context is very important.\r\n\r\nWhat about /A/ from Bell Centennial? Beautiful
    under the microscope, like an insect.\r\n\r\nBeauty\u2026 difficult to define.
    Fascinating, like Meta's g, perhaps easier to find, but then you might end up
    with an alphabet of quirky characters only.\r\n\r\nI am fascinated by sans serif
    /a/, it very easily looks jilted, pregnant, distended or over-biting."

  body: Thank you very much for your helpful suggestions! I loved especially Bell
    Centennial. It's beautiful! I think I am actually looking for these "weird" and
    special caracters as Meta's "g", 'cause I wanna honour outraging type-treatment
    and each character will get his own page, so no interactions and crazy combiantions.
    It will be like a postcard-collection (could be) kind of. So please go ahead with
    your ideas!

    However the beauty of individual glyphs is certainly a strong motivator in type
    design, even if one ends up taming (or outright dumping) an overly-attractive
    shape.\r\n\r\nBTW, that expression is much older than Feliciano. And a much better
    way to say it is: \"A typeface is a beautiful collection of letters, not a collection
    of beautiful letter.\"\r\n\r\nAnd of beauty itself: that's not even the main point
    to begin with!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    aesthetic, whether that is elegant, friendly, scary, beautiful, comical, rustic
