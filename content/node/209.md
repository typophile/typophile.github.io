  body: 'I have a very nice copy of this particular specimen book. The Italian foundry
    specimen books are always wonderful to page through. Lots of faces there are relatively
    unknown in the Anglo-American sphere. <BR> <BR>One of the faces, Fregio Serie
    900 was a grid construct. Very cool. Various pieces of the shapes of letterforms
    could be put together to form the actual letterform. Sort of like Sumner Stone&#39;s
    Means/Ends, but, as a metal face, I&#39;d bet a lot more fun to put together. '

  body: If I may ask, Gerald, what would be a reasonable price for this book? It looks
    wonderful, and I&#39;d like to pick up a copy for myself. I&#39;ve got a birthday
    coming up... ;&#41;

  body: Marc <BR> <BR>These are kind of hard to find. Abe.com is a good general source
    op books but book dealers who specialize in this area are more apt to have them.
    Oak Knoll &#40;US&#41;, Veatches &#40;US&#41;, Francis Wakeman &#40;UK&#41;, Minotaurus
    &#40;Netherlands&#41;, etc. <BR> <BR>Prices for this probably run anywhere from
    $75 to $250 &#40;I&#39;m taking an educated guess&#41; dependent upon condition
    and dealer knowledge. <BR> <BR>Some of the earlier Nebiolo &#40;1930s?&#41; are
    really something. Fat little suckers just packed with goodies. <BR> <BR>Hoping
    you have a happy birthday. <BR> <BR>

  body: Just a further note one this. <BR> <BR>For those of you with interest in metal
    type, several of the Nebiolo offerings &#40;as well as faces from other European
    foundries, including Zapf&#39;s Virtuoso!!!&#41; are still being cast at <BR>
    <BR><a href="http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/" target="_blank">http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/</a>
    <BR> <BR>including the Juliet mentioned by Berry. The specimen sheet, showing
    the face from 12pt to 60pt, is a great example of optical sizing. Incredible.

  body: I would be curious, no I am curious, for more information about this book.
    For instance, where did you get your copy? What other typefaces does it list?
    How much of a &#34;gift&#34; was it? Even if you send me a private message, it
    would be lovely. Thank you.
