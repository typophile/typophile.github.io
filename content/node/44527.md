  body: That's funny - I think they took Kabel and created their own inline as you
    suggested. But Neuland would have worked just as well and already has the inline.

  body: Darrel - it isn't actually Neuland, that's what's weird. The S doesn't match,
    among other things. Maybe they couldn't afford to buy Neuland so they faked it
    up using Kabel Ultra.
