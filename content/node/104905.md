    [[http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat|Montserrat]].\r\n\"Bite Me\"
    and \"LES PARISIENNES DE KIRAZ\" are also interesting but haven't found any match
    yet... Have you more information? Origin, more samples, website, book name...
    I've found many versions of Caslon-ish Italic swashes but unfortunately none is
    matching."
