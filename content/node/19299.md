    books with Bembo. I'd like to think they were well printed. Never had a problem
    with the face except for those related to its metal configuration. It was weak
    as a metal face in that thin crossbars such as those in the lowercase e would
    wear out quickly. But then again, Monotype was never meant to be edition printed
    so why complain.\r\n\r\nUnattractive or uncomfortable? What are you kidding? Ever
    see Mrs Eaves?\r\n\r\n"

  body: I only pick Bembo because it's an obvious touchstone. But can everyone really
    like any one type? I expect it could only be so with a type too old to be unfashionable,
    but if it can happen at all then there's a consistency, in that subset of typographic
    judgement that constitutes bibliophile taste, which I don't think exists in any
    other art or craft.

    it's easy to read which I think is more to the point. And it has a lovely italic.\r\n\r\nI
    try not to be doctrinaire about fonts because they can be so wrong or so right
    depending on their use. Not that there aren't fonts I will NEVER use (Bookman!
    anything ITC!). But I do try to keep an open mind. \r\n\r\nI for one am sick to
    death of all the new grotesks, DIN and it's ilk. And publishers like Phaidon who
    use unreadable fonts for running text thinking it's edgy and cool. "

    printing of the 1930s to 1960s, especially academic books. I''ve never been very
    impressed with Bembo in private press and limited edition printing (even when
    printed by Mardersteig), where the larger sizes are usually used. Bembo is a great
    commercial bookface, but is somehow too common for the special treatment of fancy
    papers and bindings. But give me a copy of any OUP scholarly work set in Bembo
    and its the typographic equivalent of comfort food: not spectacular, but very
    palatable and pleasing.'

  body: Interesting, John - I think I agree. Do you have a favourite for the best
    papers? I was astonished to realise that the extraordinarily beautiful book I
    was looking at a few days ago was printed in 13 point letterpress Erhardt, a type
    I never thought capable of such results, but which is apparently transformed on
    ideal stock.

    is elegant and unobtrusive and has the complete expert set. I tend to avoid Palatino
    because it still to me smacks of the era when there were so few fonts available
