  body: The angle of the A is off and the serifs have slightly different shape.. Its
    NOT a result of the terrible skewing.. the serifs are longer and narrower.. but
    very similar. Someone could have slanted each letter independantly but the overthickness
    does'nt match up even when you account for the skewing etc..

  body: 'I think you''re way overthinking it. Especially given the size of your sample.
    There is a wide variety of Bodoni''s and while I think Bold Italic is the closest,
    why don''t you root through them yourself and see? Maybe you''ll find one that
    is closer. I doubt it. '

  body: "Guys,\r\n\r\nDoesn't the name Claim Management Inc. reflect something about
    the company's font savviness?\r\n\r\nSo, really, it can be just any Bodoni that
    was high on faux-slant, faux-bold, and the possibily of not pressing SHIFT upon
    skewing :)\r\n\r\nI think Patty might be closer to the answer here, though."
