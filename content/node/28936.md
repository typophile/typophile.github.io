  \ I have an inkling it's a custom, and if so I would like to know some other fonts
  close to it (and even if it's not a custom).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWill"

    Forever type family for British Airways HighLife magazine that I did about 5 years
    ago through Fontworks UK.\r\n\r\nSo in answer to your question 'Forever' is close
    to it.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "'Forever Two' is the Treacyfaces font with this style of 'g'. The customization
    seems to be essentially the elimination of the stems, and reshaping the counters
    on letters like the 'a', 'b', 'd', 'g', 'm', 'n', 'p' and 'r'.\r\n\r\n - Mike

    first thought was FF Dax (which has similar \u2018b\u2019, \u2018p\u2019, \u2018d\u2019),
    but that's not it, either."
