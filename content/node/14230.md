body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Souvenir</strong>\r\n\r\nThe original
  Souvenir was drawn by [[Morris Fuller Benton]] and released by [[ATF]] in 1914.
  It appears, in a single weight only, in the famed 1923 ATF catalog. It has a distinctive
  \"warm and fuzzy\" look, and is probably one of the softest typefaces ever to have
  wide popularity. \r\n\r\nThe most common version today is the 1970 interpretation,
  drawn by [[Edward Benguiat|Ed Benguiat]] for International Typeface Corporation.
  When [[ITC]] was formed, Souvenir was one of their first releases for phototype.
  With its large x-height, soft round curves, and clean design, ITC Souvenir Light
  closely follows Benton's original, which anticipated their design philosophy nearly
  sixty years earlier. Ed Benguiat changed a few details and expanded the concept
  to a family of four weights in both roman and italic. ITC Souvenir became hugely
  popular, and many people associate it with the design aesthetic of the '70s and
  of early ITC types in particular. \r\n\r\nSouvenir was strongly influenced by Schelter-Antiqua
  and Tauchnitz-Antiqua (1906) from J.G. Schelter & Giesecke, a leading German typefoundry
  in Leipzig. They have many distinctive features, such as the open-bottom lowercase
  'g', the narrowed top aperture of the uppercase 'U', and the convex diagonals of
  the A that mark them as the source for Souvenir. \r\n\r\nSchelter & Giesecke had
  launched Schelter-Antiqua as their own original in-house design with very elaborate
  and beautiful specimens, an essay on its features, and a warning that they had protected
  it under German law (gesetzlich gesch\xFCtzt). It was intended as a very serious
  contender in the legibility stakes and the Schelter & Giesecke specimen contains
  a fascinating 4-page article on it. There is much emphasis on the care put into
  avoiding over-fine hairlines and achieving good spacing. Having invested so much
  work in a complete series (condenseds and semi-bolds and so on) no wonder S&G got
  legal protection for the face, in Germany at least. In fact there were several imitations,
  and one of them (not very close, but not that distant either) from an Austrian foundry
  was called 'Souverain'--probably not coincidentally similar in name to Souvenir.\r\n\r\nBenton
  had produced at the same time his entry in the legibility stakes, namely Clearface.
  Perhaps for this reason, he took ideas from Schelter-Antiqua, which was a Jugendstil-influenced
  hybrid of fraktur and roman. Benton went in another direction, giving it a 'cuddly'
  look, different from the German types. Its origins as a 'legibility' face, as well
  as Benton's and then Benguiat's skills, may account for why among 'soft' designs
  it gained wide acceptance. ATF Souvenir had nearly sunk without trace -- until the
  1960s, when the desire for typographic novelty unearthed it from obscurity and put
  it back into typographic consciousness. \r\n\r\nMac McGrew\u2019s \u2018[[American
  Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century]]\u2019 adds that its working title at
  ATF was \u2018Round Roman\u2019, and that the phototype version by Benguiat became
  so popular that \u2018Matrotype\u2019 in England cut metal faces based on it--thus
  becoming one of the few cases of phototype being cut in metal.\r\n\r\nTypophile
