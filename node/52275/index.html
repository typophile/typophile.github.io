  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello fellow typophiles,

I am currently preparing a book in french and english, due to be released in Europe and America around september 2009 at Atelier Perrousseaux publishing (the french publisher of Adrian Frutiger books), about 'forgotten typefaces': alphabets which have been drawn, possibly cast and used 500, 100 or 30 years ago but, for numerous reasons, didn't make it (yet) to the digital age and are not available on any computer. 

The increasing rarity or lack of documentation about these might bring them to complete extinction, so I thought it would be a great idea to document these letters and their authors, and to provide good quality, high resolution prints of them for the courageous designers who would have the good idea to digitize them, or simply for the pleasure to see these letters again and again. 

I already have quite a big amount of documentation, but I am very much looking for help: if you have any document (visual and/or text) about a 'forgotten typeface', I'd be very happy to consider it. Be sure that any help will be thoroughly aknowledged in the book.

Thank you in advance,
dr

ps: In the framework of this project, I am looking for some high resolution scans from the "book of oz" which I (unfortunetaly) still don't own. If some good (and lucky) soul wants to help...</div>

I have been working for the last three years on a Filmotype book of which a manuscript is undergoing further editing but I have many photos and historical information about this company as well as Lettering Inc, another photo type company originally from the 1920s. . . Very few of the photo lettering companies libraries made it into the digital age which is what inspired my initial historical preservation efforts to revive them . . .

Mark Simonson would also be good for you to approach since he has worked with and revived faces of many extinct foundries including Phil Martin's original offshoot creations . . .

Bojev: I have had the book of oz only once in my hands, and I remember that there is inside some pages with alphabets from oz cooper, apart from the famous ones I think some of them never made it to digital: these are the ones I'm interested in. Any scan would be great, but if there is a lot, maybe you can at least take some quick snapshots with a digital camera in low res and send me... then if I need some of them in high res, i can tell you which ones. Anyway, thanks in advance.

Diner: I would be happy to see your material regarding Filmotype and Lettering Inc, though if there is already a book in the making, I dont want to make the same work... And about Mark Simonson, I would be glad to get in touch with him, but again I am interested in typefaces which have not yet been revived.

Thanks again, keep posting,

The Cooper sans design featured in the Book of Oz has been digitized a couple of times, but IMO both redesigners took too many liberties with Cooper's original. So it could fairly be said that this design of his has never yet "made it into digital".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You might consider including display cuts of more common typefaces, many of which have never been digitized. The typical faces offered by the big foundries, such as Linotype and Monotype, are based on the text sizes, since that's what their pre-digital equipment was made to set. Before the digital era, most hand-set cold type (Typositor, rub-down sheets, etc.) for display sizes was based on large sizes of foundry metal type. There are significant differences between the text cuts and display cuts of metal faces, and we've lost a big part of typographic legacy in the one-size-fits-all digital era.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How about original versions of Futura and Gill Sans?
Although Futura has some good digital versions, I recall I have a Gill Sans specimen from Monotype which showed all the variants, and they were wonderful.
Something like what Mark did with Metallophile for Spartan would be great for Gill Sans, but I guess in many ways it should be Monotype duty…

Among typefaces I admire there's Behrens Antiqua (1902). The only existing digital version is from Dan X. Solo; I bought it, and while it's fairly good, it loses almost all the feeling of the original, which of course changed considerably from weight to weight.

		<div class="commentbody">If you're going to look at Cooper's work, then you should also consider the lesser known designs by his contemporaries Goudy and Dwiggins. There are probably dozens of Goudy faces that are undigitized. After all, he claimed to have designed more than 100 typefaces, some of which didn't even make it into much metal distribution (including many which may not warrant revival). Jim Rimmer would probably be an excellent resource for information about Goudy's oeuvre.

Works by Dwiggins (my area of some expertise) that might fit your criteria would include:

Charter (although Sibylle Hagman's Odile is a nice homage)
Hingham (Christian Schwartz had started something loosely based this newsface experiment; I don't recall how loose.)
Arcadia
Stuyvesant (I've been working on an interpretation/homage off and on)
Falcon
Tippecanoe
Experimental 276D

Of these, Falcon is the only one that was ever commercially produced (posthumously). Charter, Arcadia, Stuyvesant, and Tippecanoe made it into at least one commercial publication, but were not produced. Experimental 267D made it into one rare piece of ephemera that I know of. Not all of these necessarily warrant revival either. And I'm not considering other experiments that didn't reach a certain level of fruition.

I have a fair amount of documentation on many of the above list. If you're interested in pursuing any of these for your book, let me know. Your brief is pretty wide open, so I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for. I'm not so interested in contributing to a swipe book, but historical documentation is right up my alley.

It's in his <em>Goudy's Type Design,</em> so what's the point of putting Goudy faces in a new swipe book?--unless you are going to show them in real use. If you're interested in some scans of Companion from <em>Woman's Home Companion</em>, let me know.</div>

Oh my, that's a lot of answers - thanks, first. I will answer precisely to everyone today but it will take a little time. Right now, I just wanted to let you know that my book will not be a swipe: I am working closely with my publisher, Yves Perrousseaux, a well-known typophile, holding conferences in Lure every summer since 1969, close friend to Adrian Frutiger (as mentionned above, he published 4 of his books in France), currently writing the second volume to his monumental typography encyclopedia (volume one being translated in english right now). My own first book contains contributions by Erik Spiekermann, Ale Paul, Bas Jacobs and Xavier Dupre and was approved by Zuzana Licko and Peter Bil'ak; I am not preparing something else than a fully documented homage to some typefaces with hopefully great visuals and interesting texts. So, don't worry.

From there, I will probably need some of your documentation, it surely fills some gaps I have in mine. Regarding Goudy's, I'm not sure how many of his undigitized works deserve to be in the book?

Nick: You're right, if it is easily available in a book that will be in the sources list, there's no point to mention it again in mine, that was always a "rule" I had in mind. Again, my book is not a "swipe" book, please write it down somewhere.

David -- It would be more efficient for me to address any specific needs or desires you have, rather than a scatter shot of my library and research materials. If you tell me which you're including and wish to have more/better images or information about, I can tell you what I have. In addition to samples, I have some correspondence and documentation on most of what I listed.

From now on though, I think I will not be interested in Falcon, but I would love to have smt info and visuals about Arcadia and also about these 2 examples you produced in a previous discussion (http://typophile.com/node/41687), experimental 223 and this newspaper type...

David, I'm using the term "swipe" in a light-hearted manner, as per my local design book store:
www.swipe.com

You're not swiping, but are creating a book that other designers can "get inspiration" from.
Really, any design book with a lot of pictures falls into that category, but those with images that invite scanning, particularly so.

<em>it takes time and courage for a designer to spend a huge amount of time digitizing another artist’s design in order to revive it, to dedicate one’s skills to the art of someone else so that the typographic creation and the creator himself doesn’t fall into oblivion.</em>

Bullshit. Sure, it takes time and effort to do a good job of digitizing an old face, but you're pouring it on a bit thick with the rescuing from oblivion malarkey. By providing high resolution images, you will be making it easy for hacks to do a quick and dirty job autotracing from second-hand material. Where's the nobility in that?

Here's an idea: perhaps it is actually more daring to design a typeface of one's own.

I don't think I read "snapshot" clearly. Sorry if I came off too brusque. I'll put together some things to post later.

BTW, the most readily accessible compendium of WAD's types is the second volume of <cite>Postscripts on Dwiggins</cite> published by the Typophiles (the original group, not this here forum). It includes showings and information on all that I cited (except Experimental 267D, which is probably the most obscure of his "completed" experiments). Don't know how easy it would be for you to find a copy where you are.

I'll get some images up later.

BTW, the Exp 223 (from that other thread) is the same thing as Hingham (listed above). The other sample I posted in that other thread was just a drawing; no developed typeface ever came of it, so there's nothing to document in your book. (At least, I don't think you want to open the Pandora's box of experimental drawings and ideas for type that never became type.)

Here's one example. The top face is a sample of 72 pt. Bodoni foundry type (ATF) and the bottom face is the Linotype PostScript version scaled to match the size:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni001_5370.jpg]

As you can see, the display cut (top) is more elegant and refined. Generally speaking, display cuts are less bold, narrower, spaced tighter, and have finer details. In some cases, the x-height will be lower as well.</div>

The foundry specimen books abound in examples like this. You can take just about any ATF face that's been digitized and make the same case regarding the limitations of today's one-size incarnations. ATF Garamond (Linotype Garamond No. 3) comes immediately to mind.

You could also take your particular example further back to Bodoni's <cite>Manuale Tipografico</cite> and find several more cases. I guess the question is Where does David want to draw the line?

		<div class="commentbody"><cite> Piccic: I thought about that, but in all honesty, the original Futura is already available in many books, not to mention the web... I will though investigate the Gill Sans alternates (I think I saw some at the St Bride library). </cite>
Yes, David, but I don't think there is a consistent version of Futura conveying its essence.
Personally, I don't like Futura so much, but there is too much that got lost in early digitizations (for Gill, that's infinitely multiplied). It all depends on where the focus of the book will be…


I do not agree with Nick when he says, after David's comment:
<cite> it takes time and courage for a designer to spend a huge amount of time digitizing another artist’s design in order to revive it, to dedicate one’s skills to the art of someone else so that the typographic creation and the creator himself doesn’t fall into oblivion. </cite>
<strong> Bullshit. Sure, it takes time and effort to do a good job of digitizing an old face, but you’re pouring it on a bit thick with the rescuing from oblivion malarkey. By providing high resolution images, you will be making it easy for hacks to do a quick and dirty job autotracing from second-hand material. Where’s the nobility in that?
Here’s an idea: perhaps it is actually more daring to design a typeface of one’s own. </strong>

"Bullshit" un corno. It takes <cite>a lot </cite> of courage to take on one's shoulders the task of *properly* digitize a typeface, in order to get into its timeline spirit, the designer, to catch its essence and rework it for the present.
It may take a lot more courage than designing one's own typeface, since it requires one's own "ego" to be left apart in order to devote themselves to the work of another person.
At least, so it's always been for me. I've never been able to complete any re-production of lead types because it always seemed more attractive to work on original designs.

Surely Nick is right when he says this makes life easier for superficial people hacking existing work, but it all depends on how David will plan and project his book.
Unfortunately such things have always been, but if we keep worrying about this we'll be concentrating merely on potentially negative behaviors, not good ones…</div>

In Scotch Modern I worked from original impressions of metal type, drawing the glyphs by eye, with no scanning or tracing.
I didn't change the design of any of the letters. My intention was to make "facsimile" fonts, although in a different medium (digital-offset, rather than metal letterpress).

From my perspective David's book would be useful if it encouraged redesigners to seek out the raw material which he has drawn their attention to, rather than just scan and autotrace from his reproductions.</div>

But I don't think David meant the book as a source for "scanning and autotracing". It seems more about important steps under the dust in the course of history, I hope. Although it seems not easy…

I don't like the term "revival" because to me it implies a sort of superfluous addition to an original.
While this may be fine, the example of Odile is fitting. I think Sybille Hagman reworked the original forms of Dwiggins enough to make the whole typeface her own.
For the same reason I think Dwiggins Charter deserves a good digital version. It's radically different from Odile, I would never use them for the same purpose.</div>

Fine. Let’s give him and the people who read the book the benefit of the doubt. I would like to think genuine artists out number hacks/swipes considerably. Hopefully this book won’t get placed in the Dover section of your Swipe bookstore ;-)

BTW... you’ve done a nice job with Scotch Roman. Sax covers similar material, but it does not have your nice italics.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello everyone,

First of all, about the book: I of course do not intend even one second to create a book only for hackers to scan/trace the outlines and put it on the Internet. I will state very clearly in the text that the purpose, in the case of a designer wanting to revive the designs, is to give enough visual material for them work hard in order to give the digital recreation the level of excellency it deserves. Now, I sure hope it will be the case, but I don't really have the power or control over all of the people who are going to buy the book. If some of them are going to make a quick scan, that's a pity, but it shouldn't, in my point of view, stop me from making the book. I am aware that the comparison is not the best one, but it would be like not releasing any DVD anymore because some hackers will turn them into Divx and share them with the world for free in a lower resolution. Just as I read above, negative thinking only brings negativity. All I want is to put some light on great designs and great designers which are now known and available only to the happy few who have the old and costly specimen books in their shelves to the wide audience, free for them to do what they want with it as long as, and again it will be stated very clearly in the book, they respect the ethics and eventually copyrights of the material shown.

Some may still think I'm a bad guy, I feel sorry for them, I hope one day they will understand how candidly good are my intentions, and how hopefully good will be the outcome of this book.

		<div class="commentbody">David, there's to say that if you wish to properly address the idea of a conscious digital version, a good deal of samples for each typeface should be there. This, besides the difficulty in gathering it, reduces considerably the possible number of typefaces included, but it also forces the readers to a degree of awareness making it almost impossible to consider "autotracing". When you provide two or three lead samples of optical sizes, it would be difficult for a hacker to proceed: first he will have to see why there were optical versions in the first place… Of course, he still can go on and produce his dreadful toy-face, but he will have something to reflect upon…

So, I think you have two options:
1) Provide just a basic showing in order to present more typefaces: this way, with an adequate presentation, the designers intrigued by the value of the originals, will be invited to start a serious search of original printed samples.
2) Have less typefaces presented, but presented with a great deal of samples, to allow a serious digital version. I think this proves difficult, as it took me years to gather extensive printed samples of Nebiolo typefaces (lead type used to wear out, so the best thing are the original specimens…)

An example: [[http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=620608798&searchurl=bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26kn%3Dbehrens%2Bantiqua%26sortby%3D2%26sts%3Dt%26x%3D78%26y%3D12%26yrh%3D1960|Behrens Antiqua]]'s original specimen from 1908, on Abebooks.
Of course, the price it's quite a madness, I hope cheaper copies can be found…
I paid most of the Nebiolo specimens I bought a price between 15 and 30 Euros. Of course there are sellers which offer them at ten times these prices, but it's the rarity of this material which makes  its acquisition problematic.</div>

David, I have never questioned your motives, so please, spare me your pity.
Perhaps you will find this discussion of typographic swipe books in the digital era useful in developing your project; whether or not you follow Claudio's thoughtful suggestions.

Any foundry type specimen may be considered as swipe material; Johnston, in <em>Alphabets to Order</em> theorizes that one reason for using "quousque tandem abutere..." as specimen text was the limited alphabetic showing it offered copyists.

No doubt "swipe" is too loaded a word--a rejoinder to your somewhat inflated view of what you're doing, that is hopefully no longer required--so in future I'll refer to the genre as "source book", after the dust jacket blurb of <em>Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering</em> (Omega, 1985) by Jan Tschichold, no less:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tschi_6050.jpg]
.
During the 1950s and 1960s, many source books were published, such as <em>Art Directors' Book of Type Faces</em> by J.I. Biegelsen (Arco, 1963)--which enabled the letters to be photostatted (to piece together headlines), used as models for lettering artists, or to be traced by art directors for making marker-rendered comps:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Egmont_3895.jpg]

Both the above are thoughtfully provided at around A4/8.5" x 11" size, for ease of copying.

Recently, <em>Alphabets and Other Signs</em> and its sequel are good examples of "quality" source books.</div>

For example, I will include the fonts designed by Jean Alessandrini in the seventies, very beautiful and poetic, which have never been digitized so far and are quite impossible to see and use; and for this, I actually called Alessandrini 3 weeks ago, and he's delighted to give me any help I need (he fortunately kept all his original drawings, documents...). I think this is the best way to make this book. Now, all I hope is to be able to find good documents about the fonts I plan to expose: visuals, of course, but also information on the author and the foundry.

I hope it's a little bit more clear now,

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm… I think we may choose Paganini, by Raffaello Bertieri and Alessandro Butti, which was released starting in 1926. Although I do not have a specific original specimen about it, with Antonio we keep collecting material about the history of Nebiolo, Italian typography of 1900 in general, and Raffaello Bertieri and his work.
Do you mind if I ask Antonio prior to this? We are doing this research together and right now he's here in Modena for the Christmas holidays.</div>

Richard Beatty Designs released a "Cancellaresca Bastarda" many many years ago as Romulus Bastarda. Ten fonts total. 

Somewhat of an alternative to David's quest might be, which digital fonts have been forgotten (and even lost) either because of format changes, market disinterest, or the current politics of the profession.

		<div class="commentbody">I had recalled, from discussions here, a couple of "forgotten" types which don't meet the criterion of this thread, since there were digital versions of them: Emerson, already mentioned, is one; and Barbou another.

I'm in favor of having high-resolution reproductions of the faces in the book, simply because otherwise they may be difficult and expensive to find. Even people carefully redrawing the face, not just those quickly scanning a version, would find a high-resolution scan helpful.

<em>But</em>, since (as I do agree) the needs of those doing the faces properly <strong>are</strong> more important than those of those just doing poor-quality scanned versions, I would like to give this recommendation: don't just include a high-resolution image of the typefaces derived from a specimen at a large point size; if specimens at smaller point sizes, especially typical text sizes (8, 9, 10 points) are available, include those! <em>That</em> is what will <em>really</em> be needed by someone wanting to do any of these older typefaces justice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello everyone,

This rather old thread came back up, so I thought I'd drop a line.

My initial project was to tricky to handle, so it turned into making a big book about Roger Excoffon, which I did. It was released in may 2011, and is available in a bilingual edition, french and english (translation provided by Hrant Papazian). You may check it here: http://www.adverbum.fr/roger-excoffon-rault-david-atelier-perrousseaux_ouvrage-perrousseaux_4itkob6k386b.html

I actually gave a lecture at the Rencontres de Lure last august; maybe some of you were there. I just released (as a collection director) a monography of François Boltana, written by Frank Adebiaye and Suzanne Cardinal, and I am currently working on a monography of Jean Alessandrini, a forgotten and talented typographer. It is due for 2012.

I didn't totally gave up my project for this book, but it's not my priority anymore. I just wanted to thank again all the people who gave me ideas and informations in this thread.
