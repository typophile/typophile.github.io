body: "I came across this site while looking for some obscure Latex reference for
  a term paper. The design of the site and the knowledgeable comments really piqued
  my curiosity.\r\nI do have a design background, but life took me away from pursing
  it as a career (I am currently a network engineer).  So after a 5 year hiatus, I
  am trying to bring design and typography back into my everyday life.  I will probably
  do a lot of lurking, but if anyone has a computer melt-down on them, I would be
  happy to lend a hand."
