    copies of this font have you licensed, and what does a license to these nice fonts
    cost. Also what inspired you to do the strange signature lower case &#34;g&#34;s
    in the majority of you work, I find these lc &#34;g&#34;s disproportionate, unattractive

    is part of fairchild publishing which also publishes Details. So the connection
    is clear. But I have to talk to them, because we never agreed on the usage in
    w-mag. The g is just the character I really like. I always try to do something
    different. The g i used in June is maybe in 2 different fonts as well, but there
    are a varienty of oher forms used in my fonts. I dont want to get stuck in to
    much of a style. <BR>There are only two licences of June yet. One was limited
    down to just on print of an art cataloque in Denmark and the other is for Details.

    in terms of finish, I think it&#39;s a bit wide, especially in the head. I also

    is daring enough to use it as a news face!&#41;, but I saw a more serious problem
    in &#34;W&#34;: the text was way too dark, much darker than the headline settings

    was first designed in sans, one of the samples shown in the forum is teh sans
    bold version&#41;. But there it is quite usfull to have a big x-hight. I was not
    to keen to have a typeface for very long copy, but in the cataloque I was talking
    about earlier it was used in 8p and even 6p and it worked quite well. I have a
    very traditional typografic backround and I heard about all those legebility stuff
    over and over again. At the end you never really know why it workes or not. A
    big part is to get used to an alphabet. Sometimes, when I design a typeface I
    lose the overall picture of it, because I&#39;m to much into the details. Later
    it is very strange to see a printed sample. '

  body: ' &#62; there is a demand of new especilly sans typefaces <BR> <BR>Since trends
    in type design are much faster on the display side than the text side, that makes
    sense. But I still don&#39;t like it. Serif faces have such a complex beauty,
    like with June in fact. Not to mention their greater readability. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    it was used in 8p and even 6p and it worked quite well. <BR> <BR>This makes perfect
    sense, and it alludes to what I wrote about newspaper typography. Below the immersive
    reading range &#40;about 9-11 point&#41; reading becomes more &#34;choppy&#34;,
    and legibility is more important than readability. But in the optimal range, boumas
    &#40;word shapes&#41; are more important, and a smaller x-height helps. <BR> <BR>As
    for the area above the narrow range, it depends on the design. Generally you want
    a large x-height, especially if it&#39;s a Modernist design, but sometimes a Garamond
    with a small x-height set large conveys a great elegance. <BR> <BR>&#62; At the
    end you never really know why it workes or not. A big part is to get used to an
    alphabet. <BR> <BR>Familiarity is very important. But it&#39;s also used by many
    people as an escape from thinking about the beast that is readability. It&#39;s
    clear that some fonts are inherently more readable than others, but the reasons
    are very dark, and this makes most people afraid. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, familiarity
    itself is not understood. How quickly is it gained, and in what ways? It&#39;s
    very significant that the people who keep saying &#34;legibility is unimportant,
    it&#39;s just what you read most&#34; also don&#39;t bother unraveling familiarity
    itself!  :-/ <BR> <BR>The truth is out there, but we will never know it completely.
    However, this does not relieve us &#40;especially not text font designers&#41;
    of the responsability of understanding the &#34;scientific&#34; aspects of the
    craft. For example: there&#39;s a very good &#42;physical&#42; reason that newspaper
    fonts need bigger x-heights than book faces. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    and there are far enough beautyfull textfaces arround. You dont get paid for bookfaces
    and sad but true, nobody wants to read long text nowadays. Hardy a book-publisher
    asks you to design a typeface. I dont take my typographic statements to serious,
    although I have studied Latin typefaces quite intensive. Every face I do has got
    some irony in it. Typography in the last 4 centuries has been full of stupid tendencies
    and very many typographers have been totaly anal. I dont want to be like that
