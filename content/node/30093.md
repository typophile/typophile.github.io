  video clips from <cite>Helvetica</cite> on the website:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.helveticafilm.com/clips.html\">www.helveticafilm.com/clips.html</a>
  \r\n\r\nIt's tough to get the feel of the full documentary in a few minutes, but
  hopefully these will give you a taste. We've put up a snippet of our interview with
  Wim Crouwel, a nice piece of footage from the streets of Berlin that segues into
  part of Erik Spiekermann's profile, a few minutes with Experimental Jetset, and
  a clip featuring Neville Brody and Rick Poynor. Hope you enjoy them. \r\n\r\nThe
  full list of participants in the film now includes Matthew Carter, Massimo Vignelli,
  Wim Crouwel, Hermann Zapf, Erik Spiekermann, Neville Brody, Stefan Sagmeister, Michael
  Bierut, David Carson, Paula Scher, Jonathan Hoefler, Tobias Frere-Jones, Experimental
  Jetset, Michael C. Place, Norm, Pierre Miedinger, Alfred Hoffmann, Mike Parker,
  Bruno Steinert, Otmar Hoefer, Rick Poynor, Lars M\xFCller, and more.\r\n\r\nWe'll
  have a few more clips, a proper trailer, and news on our 2007 world premiere and
  screening dates soon. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Gary"

    waiting for the full thing to come to Dublin\u2026 then I\u2019ll have something
    to say about it.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to it.\r\n\r\n;^)\r\n\r\n"

    Interesting to hear about how the modernists used it, thought of the meaning of
    the typeface (which has obviously now changed).\r\nI guess it will be able to
    be ordered online? (for the out of towners)"

    about Helvetica. Hopefully it will appear at the DC film festival next year, or
    at least get some showings at the National Gallery or Art and/or The Corcoran.

    out?\r\nWe have this huge screen in one of our buildings and it would be great
    to show this to all 3 years of the graphic design departement.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    can't wait to watch the full film!!!\r\n\r\ndav2."
