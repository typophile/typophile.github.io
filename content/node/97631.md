  font converter (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/font-converter.html)\u2026\r\nBut
  for some reason it seems to skip some glyphs. Can't manage to get the euro sign
  for example.\r\n\r\nTried with FontForge as well, no success at all.\r\nWhat are
  you guys using? At best not fontsquirrel\u2026 ?\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems our favorite
  tools are lacking quite important functions.\r\nNot really happy about relying on
  some command line found through browsing the internet."

    Font Squirrel's convertor did not work for you?"

  body: Font Squirrel is using FontForge internally, and I think that is the best
    you can find. Inkscape can build SVG fonts IIRC, but it will not convert existing
    ones.

  body: "If Fontsquirrel is using FontForge, then I'm curious about how it is doing
    that.\r\nI tried converting a font with it, and it produced a file that would
    not work in safari.\r\nDo you have an idea of the command line to convert from
    a ttf file?\r\n\r\nKarl> I think fontsquirrel is fine for tests and for people
    converting their fonts, but as a professional type designer, I don't think it
    is the best idea to rely on an online tool which produces a result without giving
    me any control and understanding on what is happening. \r\nOn top of that, I wanted
    to try it today because nothing was working, and it is down because of a storm
    (?!)."

  body: "@Officer McClane, why do you need SVG as opposed to WOFF? Also, which version
    of Safari are you working with as I think SVG is only supported in later versions.\r\n\r\nI
    think that FontForge is currently the only publicly available editor that supports
    the output of SVG fonts but I do not understand all of the complexities of that
    application."

  body: "I don\u2019t use SVG fonts myself (it is a very limited font format when
    it comes to fonts for complex scripts. which is what I generally work on), but
    FontForge can be scripted and called from regular Python scripts (unlike FontLab
    which I\u2019m told you have to run the scripts inside its GUI), which is almost
    certainly how Font Squirrel is calling it. There is also a \u201Cnative\u201D
    FontForge scripting language that I often use for quick stuff, so to convert any
    font format that FontForge can read to SVG from command line, I\u2019d use something
    like this <code>fontforge -lang=ff -c 'Open($1); Generate($1:r+\".svg\")' fontname.ttf</code>,
    which should create a <code>fontname.svg</code> file in the current directory."
