  body: No? I only noticed it a couple of moths ago. But then again I don't watch
    the releases of the majors too closely. I'm more interested in new goodness from
    indie land.

  body: Naw, the Bald man is never that far off. You must've been thinking of Monotype's
    latest Bembo release of just a few months ago.

  body: Isn't this Plantin Schoolbook. It's the old Monophoto Plantin with school
    characters which was issued I think back in the 1980s.

  body: Yep. Good catch. Bembo Schoolbook is similar but Plantin Schoolbook is right.

  body: Incidentally, <a href="http://typographi.com/000490.php"><em>Wallpaper</em>
    used Plantin Schoolbook</a> to good effect a few years back. I wonder if that's
    where <em>Surface</em> got the idea.
