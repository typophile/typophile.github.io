body: What is this classic typeface used on the cover of the Sex Pistols album? I
  thought this was going to be an easy identification, but it has proved a bit harder
  than I expected. Some close matches have been Concorde and Century.

    Bold Condensed</a> feels close. But, I don't know that this would've been type
    so much as some sort of rub-down lettering.

  body: "Miss Tiffany, I don't think that E&F CBC is really too close, but Keith,
    Jamie Reid designed all the Pistols stuff and he did a lot of it with Letterpress
    work too. I think more than font matching in this instance, what you need is the
    ability to transform the idea to your situation and that is why it worked for
    Mr. Reid. Jamie Reid allegedly wrote most of the Lyrics for them too! \r\nMy goodness
    30 years and I am no longer who I was then, thank God(:!\r\nThe best song they
    ever did was \"Satalite\", which did not make it on that album, but I had the
    bootleg for years!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you free"
