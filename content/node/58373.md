  body: Knockout 90 looks really close, but there appear to be some differences with
    the C and S in particular. The single left quote too is a bit different, but that
    could have been hand tweaked to match a logo or something.

  body: Yeah, its a tricky one. i can see knockout is really close, but the terminals
    on the 's' and 'c' arent the same... this font reminds me of the c and s that
    you'd get in a bureau font, but i cant find a match from those either. hm....
