  body: I think out of all the online foundries I've seen, Fred Smeijers' <a href="http://www.ourtype.be/">our
    type</a> does the 'try before you buy' thing best. Just a personal opinion.

  body: Nearly every major vendor has an online type sampler now. Some are easier
    to use than others, and some, like OurType, sport some nice extra features, but
    the differences are minor. It's in the search, presentation, shopping cart, and
    expertise that the font sellers part.

    just about any needs.
