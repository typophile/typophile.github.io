body: "I'm actually a little afraid to ask this question because there's so much riding
  on it, but I've been planning [read: counting] on using scripts to automate the
  process of creating classes for metrics and kerning.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason is
  that I find the process painfully gruntwork-ish and would like to automate it for
  all future font projects, and second, because I've had bad experiences with FontLab
  thus far and on more than one occasion, have seen my metrics classes magically vanish
  without explanation and would like the ability to rebuild all classes the next time
  this happens.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, between the Unofficial FontLab Python API and
  the admittedly shallow official documentation, I can't find any real mention of
  metrics or kerning classes.\r\n\r\nSo, dare I ask? Is there any way to create/modify
  classes from a Python script in FontLab, or is the workflow I'm building doomed?"
