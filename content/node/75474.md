  body: "Thanks for the replies so far.\r\n\r\nI don't really consider DIN a geometric.
    I might be wrong.\r\n\r\nMuseo and Neutraface both seem a little quirky -- looking
    for something a little more cold and generic. I'll keep looking, other suggestions
    are welcome too.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    or [[http://typophile.com/node/52741|Houschka]]. I guess the x-height rules out
    the former, but it's worth a mention.

    a side note, I rediscover Museo about every two weeks. My latest rediscovery was
    here...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.polaroid.com/en/stream\r\n\r\nI'm sorry... but can we
    have a round of applause for Jos?\r\n\r\n[applause]\r\n\r\n@Chris... Graphik is
    sick. Not imaginative, but really tasteful and strong.\r\n\r\nI have also been
    looking for a nice, cold \"geometric\" sans for awhile now. "
