  that the sample, which by the way is from 1979, is of such a reduced size.&#41;  <BR>

  <BR>The caps, obviously not as Shelley Andante&#39;s though, had me going for a
  better match, which brought me first to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/embassy/"
  target="_blank"> Embassy</a>, and later to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atflorentine-script-ii/"
  target="_blank"> Florentine Script II</a>... &#40;The &#34;s&#34; has me going for
  Florentine Script II over Embassy...&#41; Still, I&#39;d very much appreciate the
  opinion of you, thank you so much.

  body: Thank you, Grant, for the tip. Yes, I had actually tried before also with
    Sackers English Script. Yet, taking a closer look at the &#34;H&#34;, think I&#39;d
    still go rather for Florentine Script II...
