body: "Hey guys. I'm working on some OpenType funnies for a project where I replace
  letter combinations with ligatures that contain visual \"dirt\", or are actually
  misspellings, or interfere with the text around it. This is easy: in the liga feature
  I sub the combos. But here's the thing. The combinations happen every single time,
  so a pattern still surfaces. If I can loop through a list of three or four variations
  for a few of the more common ones, it won't be so obvious and people will bang their
  head to the wall in irritation a lot more effectively.\r\n\r\nI've tried wrapping
  my mind around the \"Phinney\" OpenType randomisation bit, but if that's the method,
  could someone give me a pointer as to how to <em>get</em> that? I sure as hell don't
  right now."

    at TypeTrust about this. He developed an OpenType pseudo-randomizer based on the
    LIGA features for my Black Monday typeface, so he might be able to cook up something
    that will scramble the hell out of your ligatures.
