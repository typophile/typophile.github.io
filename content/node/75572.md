body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI am trying to do a graphic project capturing the spirit of
  kitsch/pop culture between 1989-1993. I am looking for popular fonts from this era,
  especially the one in the attached image. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone here know the name
  of the squarish font with horizontal serifs that appears inside the number 1 in
  this image? I used to see it everywhere in the 90's but don't know the name. \r\n\r\nIf
  you know or could recommend anything equally awesome, I'd love to hear it. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBen"

    influential at that time. It could be hand drawn on squared paper or a simple
    bitmap program.
