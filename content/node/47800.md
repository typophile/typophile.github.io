body: "I've been seeing this in a few places recently. Used for the \"Summer\" in
  the Royal Academy of Arts Summer Exhibition poster & on the catalogue. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SummerShow08Poster_4082.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SummerShow08_6640.jpg]\r\nAlso
  the recent UK editions of the Swedish Martin Beck novels.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beck_6235.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  thought it would be easy but WhatTheFont seems to ignore the R & is giving me Impacts
  & Compactas, & Identifont doesn't let me describe that distinctive R properly."
