  seen some of his work in gallery exhibitions that his calligraphy is amazing. Unfortunately
  the only thing I can find relating to his name is a book about dutch engravings.\r\n\r\n"

    knowledge and book collection here someone might know more.

  body: I was reading about a Dutch library that was digitizing it's holdings. They
    may have some of his stuff. Have you done any Library searching? Google is great
    but it doesn't have everything. Also, somebody may come along in a while and have
    some info. What about  searching for 17th c. Dutch calligraphy? It's wise with
    an obscure topic to use several approaches.

    done some more digging through digitized libraries and books to no greater avail,
    though I did find some other wonderful calligraphy. "

    I contacted a Dutch historical archive, where jaap found the book above. A copy

    Other than that the other book I found on WorldCat, I''d need to go to Boston
    for and I haven''t been there in 10 or 11 years. So that one might have to wait
    a bit longer. '

    1450-1700\u201D after all. It isn't that useful. Although it does show that he
    wasn't just engraving letters. His talents were more broad to be sure! I say it's
    not that useful because it doesn't show much in the way of letters & the ones
    it does show are very very small. \r\n\r\nWhat it might be useful for is noting
    other references that talk about him. For Instance \"Quaerendo IV 1974\" , \"
    \ Quaerendo V 1975\", and Woordenboek van Noord Nederlandsche graveurs 1938. Maybe
    they can be of use.\r\n"
