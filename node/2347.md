  body: I agree with Karl&#39;s guess, but if you are looking for something similar
    Juke Box fonts &#34;Boxer Script&#34; might work. The fonts are sold at Veer.com<img

  body: Thanks Mike. Here&#39;s a direct link to <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000010">Boxer
    Script</a>, but you might want to look at <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=JBT0000019">Fenway
    Park</a> as well. It doesn&#39;t have as harsh of a baseline join as Boxer Script
    does.

  body: You&#39;re right Grant. I looked at both, but got too preoccupied with letterforms
    to notice the joins in my small samples in the Script Guide.
