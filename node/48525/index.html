<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>What can be done to this to make it a
typographic logo truly worthy of a
national type society?

The red-orange color is meant to evoke the "red center" of Australia with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru>---->the rock Uluru<----</a> being our national icon.
It's probably very fortunate that the profile of the rock happens to resemble the profile of the Sydney Opera House as well as the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I also designed a typeface known as <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/arboghast/2467911416/in/set-72157604893392854/>The Angel of the Odd (ultrabold version below Jellybrush in this sample)</a> a number of years ago. It has an extreme shape in it which happens to look a lot like the Opera House. Should we consider using the Angel for ATC? Or would that amount to grandstanding and proprietizing the ATC with my own personal typo motif too strongly?
About this current logo attempt: Should the letter outlines be tighter? Give them a high-tension effect?
Oh the ink traps on the t! Well, you see, Evert Bloemsma invented that. I love it because look, <em>look at that</em>, look at the tiny 150 x 150 pixel and 100 x 100 pixel small versions. Those traps are only about 12 units wide on 1000 unit per em characters. But they keep working even at tiny reproduction sizes. I love that effect because it proves how powerful the design principles Evert was working on really are. A triumph for Dutch type design.
What else?
What else would you do to it?
Anything else?
That's all I could come up with in three hours.
[Edit: I just removed "ghosts that sell memories" from the thread title. Had to get your attention somehow ;^)]

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>James, I like it. That in-your-face trapping will be a great conversation-starter, and alludes nicely to the fact that type design is a craft. Minor: you might make the top-left trap a little bit smaller since the original angle is larger than the other three.
The only thing that jumps at me is that the "a" has a nice wonkiness, but the "t" and especially the "c" are a bit too tame in comparison.
One other thing: "australian type club" isn't properly centered under "atc".
> Evert Bloemsma invented that.
Evert was a singularly inventive designer*, but I don't think we can give him credit for inventing trapping, even in the special case I suspect you mean: showing off trapping.
* Legato is the most significant font in centuries.

<div class=commentbody>The cream color looks faded compared to the orange and black. I would just use white and be done with it. Or you could try using a gray instead of black. Not sure.
I'd also consider making the box a bit bigger on the left. It almost looks like a mistake.
I'd stick with this typeface. A little less of a time stamp on it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello James,
I really like the colours.
Hrant said <cite>the “t” and especially the “c” are a bit too tame in comparison.</cite>
I second that.
The whole thing is not centered within the square, but also not decidedly right-aligned. I’d either center it, or make the square bigger, to the left.
The t with ink traps – is that the Crux australis? ;-) Like it.
A minor thing: the ‘ra’ combination in Australian looks unfortunate and could be fixed in a logo.
The <a href=http://www.typographischegesellschaft.at/tga_logo.html>TGA logo</a> (Typographic Society of Austria) comes to my mind: it has also three lowercase letters. They comment on it as follows:
<cite>t — Thesis (state of the art in the founding year of tga)
g — Garamond (historic, timeless)
a — Herbert Bayer (Austria’s only noteworthy contribution to the history of type design)
The metal type impression is anachronistic detail and reminiscence.
</cite>
Quite interesting, no?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant --- I suppose I should call them "white spots". They're ink traps yes, and Evert can no more be credited with having invented such things than anyone else. But he was inventive in the way he deployed them on things like lower t's and other kinds of cruciform joints by using exaggerated or high-concept traps to replicate the functions of serifs but in reverse, functioning as whitespots.
I'll send you a sample of the kind of thing I've been working on for Linda Cunningham. Itemulates the gaps in the bowls of Vincent Connare's Magpie with exaggerated taper on bowl joints.
Legzto, yes, I think you are accurate in characterizing it as Legato is the single-most significant font in centuries.

<div class=commentbody>Florian---the ra is ruff and I need to tidy that area up.
<em>The t with ink traps – is that the Crux australis? ;-) Like it.</em>
I actually call that a "cruciform" joint. If you examine the 100 x 100 bitmap at 3x zoom --- amazing how those things translate to aliased pixels at tiny size.
The tga logo I hadn't seen before. Thanks for that. Um, the forms I built for this were Thesis-influenced, yes. De Goot is kind-of unavoidable, so influential on so many of us.
Garamond, yes, there is an element Garamond-like bending in the hood of the a and the cursiveness in the t and c.
Bayer I'm not greatly influenced by, altho I do love what I was able to do to Bayer Universal / Bauhaus and get away with it : ^ ) Benguiat is probably more influential on the sentinel design canon. I've used the principle of the quarter round in a few faces now. The original was Midnight Kernboy. The thesis / signature version is known as the Angel, and Amity is the commercial version, a "soft" angel.
There are cross-cultural design connections everywhere and I gues a lot of those things are put there specially for us to find.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like it. Although I would consider widening the margin between the wordmark and the left and top border. I like your idea of positioning it in the bottom right corner though. As for the colours: I think you'd either want to make the cream colour a bit darker, or the black a bit lighter, or maybe add a speck of brown to it. I'd also take a look at the r<>a in Australian and at the c<>l<>u in club. Nevertheless, I think you did an awesome job!

<div class=commentbody>If the t in "australian" is going to have the traps, should other letters, too (e.g. the y in "type")? For consistency you might want to have either
- traps only in the big letters (that is, the big t)
- traps only in the big letters and the initials (that is, the t in type but not in australian)
- traps everywhere they make sense (any stroke intersection? any acute stroke intersection? not sure what the "rule" would be)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes folks the kerning of the tagline is very ruff :^) Hee, moo, etcetera. I neglected to explain too that the whole typeface I'm using for this is quite ruff 'n ready. It's a quickie bold made using a fotnlab's bold filter. I only put traps on the t to begin with. The type needs refinement.
Yes, the proportional ratio of the mark to the left margin is a problem. Its bite has been deemed uncertain.
Darrel---I've experimented with the tagline benath the box and felt it reduced the simplicity. The advantage of doing that way, the tagline ends up larger and the logo will reproduce even smaller. Another thing I experimented with was a tagline going the whole width of the box but still inside it, and letterspaced. Letterspacing the tagline I thought could be a way of evoking the vast opens spaces and distances between population centers characteristic of Oz. Unfortunately the letterspaced versions look like crap at small sizes and I don't even want to post them.
Another reference for the cruciform t---the Southern Cross constellation. That's handy.

<div class=commentbody>The cream white. Oh <em>that</em>.
The anuerysm I had last year left me permanently sight-impaired. I still have a very light blothcy moire pattern overlaid in my feild of vision, and this means looking at high contrast images is not so easy. My eyes and my brain get tired having to compensate for the distortion. One way of alleviating the malady is to work on cream and light gray paper. My paper color wound up being the white here. I think it's a good choice because it helps suggest yellow without actually using yellow.

<div class=commentbody>Nice James.
The stroke thickness of the "a" could maybe be adjusted to to either appear deliberately bolder than the "tc" or made slightly lighter to counter the optical illusion that the light coloured shape is thicker than the black ones appear to be the same weight.
I like the slightly off-white off white colour & I like the rhythm & sort of progression the tails of the "atc". I could maybe be played with a bit?
I agree with others that there could be more space at top and left. (But just a smidgen)

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Graham---I'm flexible about it, now and in the future. If you have ideas for this now is the time to put them forward. I'm trying to finalize this as an initial logo design, but of course other people may have ideas in future years which will be up for consideration.
I think we may end up using numerous different ATC logos for different purposes, and the design of each can be an integral part of club-goings-on. For example, if we decide to devote one year to calligraphic lettering then we'll need a caligraphic version of the ATC logo for that year. Another year it might be a celebration of the renaissance Italian roots of book roman type, and whoever is most enthusiatic can design an exaggerated Jenson-esque ATC logo for that year. And so on.
Paul---yes ATC is full steam ahead as of now. We're not just playing. You have to give it time to gain momentum and be patient while we organize and acquire the resources needed to incorporate. Once it's incorporated we will have access to serious funding and the fun can really begin.
Russell---yep, the <strong>a</strong> does appear optically larger than the dark type. See latest version, in which the big white <strong>a</strong> has lost some height to compensate.
<em>. . .I could maybe be played with a bit?</em>
You're welcome to play with it and make new iterations. Start with the newest large bitmap below. You want vector files? Erm, I can let you have it as EPS, I suppose.
===================================================
The body text in this sample uses a dark bown ink. The new logo comps have the same dark brown color for the t - c.

<div class=commentbody>I would put the tagline under the block and tighten the "atc". The idea of including traps is clever, but I don't think it aesthetically works. It looks like a mistake to those who are not type-oriented and even then, it is only the "t" that has that treatment. I would keep it all clean. If not, then make the box more organic to fit the "t".

<div class=commentbody>(much laughter) I was hoping some Aussies would make a few joke suggestions like that :^) Thanks guys.
Three motifs we can rule out categorically: coat of arms, kangaroos, outline of Australian sland slab. It's interesting how the kangaroo works for Quantas. "It helps that" the Quantas 'roo is stylized and usually seen on the tail fin of jumbos.
The square logo --- looks like we're going for the self-contained one.
Milton&#8212;I'm still experimenting with the spacing. "atc" and the tagline in first version looked a bit loose. Now I've gone too tight. For a color application I think dark type on an orange square will work fine. We can try a straight inverse treatment with light type on orange too, to see how that looks.
@Tiffany: <em>...and I wouldn’t align the box with the formal name either.</em>
Can you expand on what you're getting at there for me? Thanks.
====================================================
The font I'm making for this will very likely be posted in the sans serif critique forum, and when it's finished I'm thinking of releasing it as a free font to help promote ATC and solicit users of the font for cash donations to help fund ATC.

<div class=commentbody>@Tom: <em>I would put the tagline under the block and tighten the “atc”. The idea of including traps is clever, but I don’t think it aesthetically works. It looks like a mistake to those who are not type-oriented and even then, it is only the “t” that has that treatment. I would keep it all clean. If not, then make the box more organic to fit the “t”.</em>
I tested this on a dozen people at work today who aren't type-oriented, and none of them saw the traps as a mistake. Half of them didn't even notice the traps are there.
I think consistency in design is vastly overrated, or at least overvalued by designers. Typographic design and typeface design are unlike buildings and automobiles in the sense that a typeface is a team of individual players that combine the strengths and weaknesses of each character. Logo design tends to overlook or neglect this vital aspect of typeface design. I'd like to keep some inconsistency in this logo as a reference to the philosophical side of type design.
Why does every element have to have the same treatment (why do we all have to think this way)? Integration of form and finish is one thing. Humanism is something else.
There are practical reasons for not putting the same style of traps on the a and c. They won't go on the c because there's nowhere to put them on the c without having it look unnatural. I could suggest or emulate them with kinks on the inner profile, but somehow anticipate that will look contrived. In the second iteration the traps on the a were exaggerated, but they can be even more exaggerated and still look natural so I'll try that.
My rationale for why the t can have such pronounced traps has to do with its structure. Of the three letters present, only the t has a four way cruciform joint. Each letter is individual and has its own requirements.

<div class=commentbody>One thing about this logo I'm not satisfied with&#8212;it's boring and isn't memorable. I'm glad people here like it, but it has to communicate to people outside the typosphere, so I'm thinking of scrapping this design and doing something with an animal or a tree or some other natural motif.
Feel free to suggest motifs that might work. I want something suitable for a typographic treatment.

<div class=commentbody>why is it trying to communicate with no typosherians?
it is bland ... agreed. and that was my initial reaction ... but it has an almost no pomp timeless "government body" feel to it. Which is how I imagine the logo will get most of it's placement ... i.e, as a sponsor or supporter of an event, publication etc.
I'd be happy to throw a couple of ideas up - that was probably the wrong phrasing to use ... as was typing what I thought and actually leaving the original. Yes ... it's Friday!

<div class=commentbody>There's a difference between bland and subtle, with the latter being "subvisible", until one learns to see it. And subtlety is a cornerstone of type design. James just has to have the right amount of it.

<div class=commentbody><em> A triumph for Dutch type design.</em>
That's great and all, and I love the crazy inkwells, but if you are working to communicate the AUSTRALIAN type club, then any Dutch-ness would seem to have little relevance. Just sayin'.
I can't say I've seen too many different type club logos. Society for Typographic Arts in Chicago uses a simply monogram in a box. I think the type changes with application, which makes it more intereting. The Type Directors Club seal has always said "typography" to me because of the unique relationship of the drawn letters. Simply typing out "TDC" or "ATC" or any monogram doesn't really say much about the organization beyond "we've got a keyboard and we're not afraid to use it".</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some kind of mark with the letters ATC beneath it or to one side, like the NAB logo.

<div class=commentbody>James, I think that illustration style would work very well, but the symbol you choose should be something about type - probably a letter, maybe the "t". Maybe make the "t" larger and "umbrella" the "a" and "c"?

<div class=commentbody>That has possibilities. Thanks Hrant. I made two more dummies
just to explore a few other directions. What about the tiki / tribal
treatment but a letter or letters rather than an abstract face?

I have to be very careful to not use any kind of genuine aboriginal artwork or imagery as the Arboriginal people are very sensitive about that stuff.
Now, if we can conjure up a petroglyph in typo form.

<div class=commentbody>My immediate reaction is that you might end up with an image that is too ‘cod’-Aboriginal.
Actually the vegemite/toast joke concept made me wonder, if you just had the counter of an A (with the trap) as the vegemite, and had it with no other type within the box it would make a striking, while subtle, mark – a typographic mark with no immediate reference to type, gah! probably overthinking it.

<div class=commentbody>Hey James,
I think the Indigenous angle would be a mistake, especially given that the club in question is based on a history of written language linked with European/Western culture, the very cultures that committed many atrocities against said Indigenous peoples.
Agree with Hrant, the T could be used to umbrella the other characters, but it might be starting to get laboured at that point.
Hope you feel "up" soon mate. Remember though, Aussies don't get the Blues, we get the Sh1ts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One thing we are definitely not doing is cultural symbols. The recently posted pics are passing thoughts, attempts, brainstorming, thinking out loud.
So erase from your mind the primative drawing style of that wiggly guy and replace it with, say, a Dada drawing style, or a polished typographic outline style in the European typo-tradition.

<div class=commentbody>@jonsel: <em>That’s great and all, and I love the crazy inkwells, but if you are working to communicate the AUSTRALIAN type club, then any Dutch-ness would seem to have little relevance. Just sayin’.</em>
As Hrant said, trapping is not Dutch.
Initially I said: <em>Those traps are only about 12 units wide on 1000 unit per em characters. But they keep working even at tiny reproduction sizes. I love that effect because it proves how powerful the design principles Evert was working on really are. A triumph for Dutch type design.</em>
It was misleading of me to say "A triumph for Dutch type design" at the end. Sorry, my goof. To put it another way, I love the effect I'm getting with the Bloemsma-inspired traps on the <strong>t</strong>. Evert's methodology inspires me to design type in my own way, using my own instincts, and I hope this can be a triumph for Australian type design.

<div class=commentbody><em>As Hrant said, trapping is not Dutch.</em>
Yes, yes, I know. I latched on to your "triumph of Dutch type design" comment, which struck me as an odd thing to be basing an Australian organization's logo on. Seems we both erred there.
To the rest of you boomerangs, I don't believe I suggested kangaroos, wallabies or any other hopping marsupial, did I?
Maybe the inkwell concept can work, but perhaps you've got to blow it out like Amplitude. I can see the point of having a typographic logo that typographers will understand but may be somewhat esoteric to others, but it has to still have some visual distinction to it.
Good luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>What a curious little icon.
Is this still a goer?
The orange looks more PMS than red centre
Where is the air - we live in a BIG space, not a semi detached in Archway
And the typeface is... ghastly. This comes with way too much baggage be considered in any way representative, neutral or thoughtful.
At the end of the day there has to be some skill evident, some craft and preferably a glimmer of beauty.
You have chosen a super doozy mate. I have a lot of sympathy, it is a difficult brief.
I would give myself some very serious strictures on this one. Stay away from indigenous imagery for Bruce’s sake.
Failing that, just use Arcturus’ logo... it is a beauty.
