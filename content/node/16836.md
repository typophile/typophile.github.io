  one that has been chosen is by my opinion a very bad choice. I would like to have
  them ranked by other designers to help me in determining if I'm right or not...thanks
  in advance

  body: Everything you've posted so far is forced. Why do you need a logo? Why not
    just use type tastefully and describe your business. I'm asking you to review
    your business plan. Are you retail or a concern that deals with corporations?
    Ask hard questions about your business before deciding you need a new logo/idenity.
    The looks you have posted look like design for design sake. They are not focused
    on a sound marketing plan.

    understatement! My boss and there boss wants it...I've fought the fight and lost.
    I just want help ranking what they are considering. To be able to make the best
    pick or at least something to build on from what we have to choose from. I'm saying
    if you had to put them in order first to last, how would you?"

  body: "Well... If <a href=\"http://www.dccusa.com/images/hdr-logo.gif\">this is
    your current logo</a>, I can see why they might feel inclined to redesign. That
    mark is a little dated (seems \"early Internet start-up\" to me... must be the
    swoosh).\r\n\r\nI <em>do</em> tend to agree with Dan that these options seem somewhat
    forced and/or arbitrary. However, I understand you're at a point where you can
    only go forward. So here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\nI like the concept behind <strong>C</strong>
    and <strong>D</strong> -- the chain of communication. However, it took me a while
    to figure that out... it's not immediately obvious in either one.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    in the marks which use 'DCC', but don't include the text for \"Corporation\" I
    get confused by what the second 'C' is for.\r\n\r\nI don't really understand the
    meaning of the marks in <strong>A</strong>, <strong>E</strong> and <strong>F</strong>.
    \r\n\r\n<strong>B</strong> frankly has a 1980s feel to me. It also bugs me that
    the text is trying to be justified, but isn't (due to the italics?).\r\n\r\nThe
    condensed typefaces in several of them could be problematic at small sizes/on
    the Web. \r\n\r\nJust some random thoughts... sorry, it's not really a \"ranking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a little rough. Agree that without the corporation text I'm left confused about
    the second C. I like the type in A. It would stand up to a fax, and that's something."

  body: A good rule of thumb is, don't ever show a design you wouldn't want your client
    to pick.. But we've all been there. The best way to talk someone out of a "bad"
    design that they've latched onto is to give them a better alternative, and a well
    thought out explanation, after that, it's out of your hands. I think if you could
    tell us which one they've picked, and which one you prefer, it might be a bit
    easier to critique...

    be taken lightly and SHOULDN'T be based SOLEY on the logo. Because once they have

  body: "Wow! I just found this site today...great stuff!\r\n\r\nI had sent the same
    graphic to several design buddies to get some outside feedback. I heard exactly
    what I wanted to from them but my boss just thought the opinions were biased.\r\n\r\nNow
    a little background on my situation... I was ask on a Wednesday afternoon to create
    a new logo by Friday.\r\n\r\nMy boss had gone to a trade show and someone told
    him that\r\n\r\n\"oh, your Dialogic... I didn't know who DCC was. I've heard of
    your product but know the company as dialogic.\"\r\n\r\nThat prompted the whole
    new identity issues...\r\n\r\nNow that was several weeks ago and there's a long
    story go along with how we got to where we are today. I was given the new requirements...\"let's
    emphasize DIALOGIC and minimize the DCC.\r\n\r\nI took on the challenge anyway,
    expressing my concerns knowing that the time frame was ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI submitted
    some very rough ideas by Friday as ask...but my boss didn't have time to review.
    (Put off until Monday) I show up Monday morning and my boss and the VP of Marketing
    pull me in the conference room to tell me they have outsourced the job to someone
    who specializes in branding. Hey, I'm cool with that (didn't like the circumstances
    but the heat was off me). Hey fresh ideas... a group that specializes in this
    area (I'm kinda the Jack-of-all-trades, design, web, flash, multimedia...ok at
    all but not great at any).\r\n\r\nA week and a half later...the new ideas are
    presented. Initially they didn't like anything...they went back and forth for
    another week to make suggested changes by my bosses. (I'm not involved in the
    process at all at this point)\r\n\r\nSeveral days after that I was pulled back
    into the project...I was told to try to come up with something, we we're at a
    dead end. So here I go again...this is where the \"forcing is an understatement\"
    comes in. So at this point you can imagine my frustration... I'm reaching for
    anything and everything. That would explain the real lack of meaning to my designs.\r\n\r\nI
    am impressed that several of you could see the fact that they were \"forced\".\r\n\r\nNow
    here's the deal with the logo comps I provided...they have decided to go with
    \"D\" as the new logo. I'm not particularly attached to any but think several
    have some potential with refinement. I'm having a very difficult time accepting
    this choice. They are set on this chain thing...linking and all that. Although
    there is a concept behind it, I don't think the logo works. Am I just too attached
    to the project or can somebody back me up on this design?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks guys!"

    heard of your product but know the company as dialogic.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    reason your boss wanted to rebrand was because the name \"Dialogic\" is known
    but no one associates DCC with company.\r\nThey might like the chain concept,
    but it still doesn't utilize the strength of the company's brand, which apparently
    is the name and not the logo.\r\n\r\nIf their name is their best asset, they should
    capitalize on it, and not subordinate it by placing it under a confusing image/monogram.\r\n\r\nIf
    one calls by phone and is greeted by \"Hello, Dialogic...\" and not \"Hello, DCC...\"
    then that is also part of the branding strategy.\r\nUse the name and forget creating
    a \"mark\" as the focus of the logo.\r\nDan Weaver made a similar suggestion above
    and I agree.\r\n\r\nThe BEST thing your company can do is to strengthen the NAME
    brand and forget any graphic/icon on the logo."

  body: After reading the background, I'm not sure why you're still making "DCC" logos
    when the stated problem is that you will only be recognized as Dialogic. It's
    a shame that you probably can't dissuade your employer from the chain idea, but
    see if you can apply it tastefully to a full wordmark "DIALOGIC".

  body: "I agree with most comments, the logo concepts shown are somewhat forced,
    but still a step up from the dish of DCC identity currently in use. What your
    firm needs is branding with \r\nthe implementation of narrative design (narrative
    design is essentially story telling). Tell a story of how the company was founded,
    what drives it, who drives it, how it's services are improving customers lives,
    profits, etc..the visual elements will fall in place once this is established.
    Hire a consultant to get you through this phase if required. It may well be a
    wordmark that will ends up being the visual identity that becomes the final solution,
    but the proper solution should not be guess work. \r\n\r\nAll implementation aside
    here is my critique on a purely aesthetic basis-\r\nA. feels a bit CSA retro,
    it is legible and may well imply a connection of some sort by the honeycomb hex
    shaped grid connecting the DCC. I like this. \r\nB. simply sucks, unbalanced,
    heavy handed, poor proportions, dated-delete asap\r\nC. hard to read, at first
    I was seeing slanted \"s\" shapes, concept is not bad, just requires a \r\nsome
    more work.\r\nD. looks like a lot of mid 90's electronica music labels, concept
    is nice with the links between the letters which works best with the D-C but not
    quite as well with the second C-C link\r\nE. again the honeycomb/ hex concept.
    would recommend a very neutral typeface for dialogic communications, and decrease
    space between logo and type as well as make type slightly smaller\r\nF.most people
    will see the DC as an X and wonder what the second C is. it is cool looking but
    will not work.\r\n\r\nthere is an obviously fascination with horizontal flipping
    of C glyphs. this sometimes works but I think traditional options should be further
    explored. "

  body: Another problem with a ABC type of mark is how much support will go behind
    the mark. International Business Machines spent millions to get consumers to recognize
    IBM and it was justified because consumers (even corporate ones) didn't associate
    their main product (computers) with machines. My feeling is if it isn't broke
    don't fix it. If its slightly flawed tweek it. My guess is you need just a tweek
    and to make a major overhaul without a major expense (signage, redoing the website,
    stationary and ads to introduce the mark) is probably way beyond any budget conciderations.
    I would suggest a study about how much it would cost to change your idenity and
    a budget and a time period to implement it. I think upon review your company will
    think twice about what someone comments at a trade fair.

  body: argh! i'll chime in my two cents. firstly dan makes some perfect points i
    reckon! you're in a dang-frustrating position! marketing and the like saying one
    thing but doing another. a pretty logo or icon isn't going to  help if it isn't
    implemented correctly in the bigger scheme of things. personally, if i had to
    pick i like the C option. but i'd drop the last   so it's just DC and focus on
    a wordmark for dialogic. it's a helluva catchier than dialogic communications
    corporation or DCC. that sounds so eighties and is such a mouthful. maybe i've
    seen that DC looking logo before?

  body: "I want to echo the sentiments of those who have said that you should ditch
    the whole DCC concept. The only reason people go to acronyms is in the case of
    confusing or misleading long names. If Dialogic (which sounds a heck of alot better
    and more tech-advanced than DCC) is not a specific trademark threat - I would
    stick with that in a heartbeat. If you must have a mark (and believe me I know
    some clients are funny about that - they want a \"mark\") then freeing yourself
    from the millstone of DCC hung around your neck is a plus. Any mark would need
    to be super clean and simple - although I think a nice word mark would do fine.
    I do agree also that the design must flow organizally from a sound idea of a marketing
    plan and a brand. Also please get the word corporation out of your logo. It only
    belongs on tax forms and legal documents.\r\n\r\nI also have to mention that it
    is rather unfair to ask you to do this in a matter of days - enough time must
    be given to ruminate on what the mark has to convey. If not you end up ust decorating
    the word.\r\n\r\nOne final thought that we have all learned the hard way. The
    best place to kill a logo you don't like is on your desktop. Only take in the
    ones you can stand behind 100% save the others (if you must) as a backup. I have
    found one trick that helps (although some may say it is a little heavy handed).
    When I work on marks for a new client I may take a few marks with me on single
    boards, but the only one I flesh out (ie throw on a stationery set, use in a fake
    ad, put on a shirt - whatever) is the one I think is the absolute strongest -
    the others are not shown unless I fear I may be losing them. What I find is that
    when a company sees it fully realized before them they feel they are purchasing
    a brand. If you do then show the single logos, most people will not be able to
    imagine how it would work with the brand and they will usually say \"these are
    ok - but I like THIS (indicating the total brand) its kind of like adding marbles
    to a bowl of veggie soup in a way, but in another way it just shows your level
    of confidence in which logo is best suited for the job.\r\n\r\nAgain - that may
    seem a bit tricksy for some, but it has kept me from having to brand ugly. I have
    also MANY times been in the position where the real client is the wife. Just wait
    till you have to design a logo to match the office's interior decor. Happens ALL
    the time in dentistry and similar professional clients. \r\n"
