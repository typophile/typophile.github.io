  body: Any idea? Is this custom perhaps?

  body: Custom, but not particulary well done, The designer must have started with
    an existing font, &#40;over&#41;slanted it and added flourishes.  <BR>Look at
    the way the flourish on the D is attached -- it looks like a cut up O, clumsily
    glued on. The A is really bad; far too heavy in relation to the rest.  <BR>Thus
    must have been a well paid job and it makes one wonder about the ethical side
    of doing these kind of jobs...

  body: Thank you, gentlemen. Im doing a flyer for a theatre that is doing this show
    and was wondering if this font was available for purchase, they want the same
    look.

  body: If you need to do a flyer, you could do a reference or &#34;hommage&#34;  <BR>by
    using a similarly flavoured design, for example something  <BR>by <a href="http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=walcott&amp;producttype=TYP"
    target="_blank"> Jason Walcott</a> from Jukebox Type, like <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0001003"
    target="_blank"> Cabernet Italic Swash</a>  <BR>or <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0001000"
    target="_blank"> Cavetto Italic Alternate</a>. That&#39;s always better than &#34;copying&#34;
    the  <BR>original IMHO.

  body: The imperfection of this logo may well have been intentional if they were
    trying to make it look &#34;old fashioned.&#34; The general style has many similarities
    to the late-nineteenth-century &#34;antique&#34; style. Some examples are Bookman,
    Century Old Style, Bruce Old Style, Tiffany, etc.
