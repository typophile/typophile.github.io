body: When creating a bitmap image (halftone screen - round) I have a problem getting
  the circles perfectly round no matter which resolution I start with and which frequency
  I use. I want to use them pretty big for a museum wall decor but they just look
  rough no matter which settings I use. Any ideas???

    can help you out.

  body: "With a bitmap, the circles aren't going to come out looking perfectly round
    unless your output resolution is really high.\r\n\r\nDoes the output absolutely
    have to be a bitmap, or will grayscale do? Because you could just create the bitmap
    at, say, ten times the target resolution, convert it to grayscale, and then resize
    the image down to 10%. You should end up with nice anti-aliased circles."
