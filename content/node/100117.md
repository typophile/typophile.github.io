  get some help.  I tried doing a search but have had no luck in finding these fonts.
  \ \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone knows of what both of these fonts are?  Both
  the cursive and typeface.  Or anything similar. \r\n\r\nSorry for the terrible pictures.
  \ It looks better zoomed out lol. \r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!
  \ \r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\n-Kristina \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo
