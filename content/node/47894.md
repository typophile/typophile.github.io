    feedback, and always interested in constructive criticism.  Asvetic, do you have
    any kerning suggestions?  We're web specialists, and from what I can tell you
    guys are typography and font specialists, so we would love any helpful feedback
    \ you may have!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGordon"

  body: "Looking at \"Sanford Book\" on a free download site I have to say Florian
    is right. Whatever the designer, Jennifer Dickert, chose to call it, it sure looks
    like she customized Americana in Fontographer and gave it a new name. The resemblances
    are for more convincing than the minor changes that make it no longer identical
    to its model. What the heck, Phil Martin did it (probably with permission) with
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/scenario/|Scenario]] for URW, so why should
    I complain? [It's my understanding that URW,  like Bitstream, was allowed to keep
    renamed digitizations of fonts that they converted from pre-digital formats for
    the original foundries.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sanford Book, huh? It\u2019s Americana, adulterated.\r\n\r\nThis is what
    the causer says:\r\n<cite> It started out as a blend of 2 fonts which I further
    manipulated and refined.</cite> \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jenniferdickert.com/fonts/sanford.shtml\">Jennifer
    Dickert</a>\r\n\r\nThis is a good example for what is typical of a lot of (not
    all) free fonts:\r\nTheir creators too often take the easy way and start with
    someone else\u2019s outlines. That\u2019s not only lazy, it\u2019s uninspired.
    If you don\u2019t have an idea of your own, don\u2019t start designing type. Running
    [[Richard Isbell]]\u2019s Americana and some other poor typeface through a blend
    filter is not \u2018an idea\u2019.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the fonts technically
    are inferior. With amateur fonts, there\u2019s no quality control, as you would
    have with commercial foundry fonts.\r\nJust have a look at these characters (these
    are only the most obvious glitches):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sanford_5719.png]\r\n\r\nManipulated?
    \u2014 Yes. Refined?\u2014 No. Type design and font production is a time-consuming
    and ambitious task. One needs a lot of knowledge \u2013 not only in terms of software.
    And did I say <em>free font?</em>. Heck, she even asks $10 for it.\r\n\r\nEnd
    of rant.\r\nGordon, I have to admit that it looks quite nice on your website.
    If it works for you&nbsp;\u2026 For what JD did: it doesn\u2019t necessarily have
    to be against the law (I don\u2019t know), I just find it quite unethical. \r\nBottom
    line: There\u2019s a reason why type costs money.\r\nF"

  body: "<cite>Asvetic, do you have any kerning suggestions?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's not
    huge, very minor tweaking.\r\n\r\nBei - tighter\r\n\r\nwi - loosen\r\n\r\nicked
    - tighter\r\n\r\nyou can even tighten the space between Being and Wicked slightly.
    I say this because Being is floating out there alone and Wicked is anchored down
    by the Fire and the tag line. In fact, I might use the distance between the bottom
    of Wicked and the top of the tag and use it to a basis for the space between Being
    Wicked and the Fire. Balance and consistency. \r\n\r\nI really like that fire!
