body: "I want to make a tidy guide/checklist for Peace Walker, and for that I'm looking
  for the font that it uses in the headers, like \"Mother Base\", etc. I've tried
  several typeface identification engines, but none worked. However this font looks
  too distinct to be completely custom-made. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  I couldn't find any HD screens online, so I had to go and shoot the TV with a camera,
  sorry for the quality.\r\nI can find and photograph other letters and symbols, if
  they're needed."

    but the other glyphs don't match...

    very loosely similar... Feels "freebie" to me. I can only suggest you to have
    a look to some sections at DaFont. This will be long but might work: [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno

  body: Thanks, I've looked through these categories, found a couple fonts that are
    really similar (Aero Matics, Beer), but no exact match. Especially for that distinct
    "S". Thank you anyway, I only need several words so I think I"ll splice them from
    what I already have.
