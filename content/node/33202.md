    a little spacing by line is just a little more to think about. Creating a die
    for a single paragraph is also possible, but would be incredibly expensive."

    yea, get a polymer plate made. That shouldn't be THAT expensive (couple hundred

      letterpressing.

  body: "A photopolymer plate is a thin, hard plastic plate mounted on a thin metal
    backing where the stuff to be printed is raised. A special machine makes the plates,
    from regular old film output (or even directly/digitally I assume). It can cost
    as little as 50 cents per square inch. But you do need a thick metal back to raise
    the plate to type-high, and those aren't very cheap (although many letterpress
    outfits will have some handy). I printed my business cards this way:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/21340\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Polymer plates also come with adhesive backing which sticks to a base plate,
    so you'd make your digital file, send the PDF to a platemaker (like, for example,
    Boxcar), buy a base plate (Hrant's right, they ain't cheap), then stick the polymer
    plate to the base and start printing. Anything you can do on a computer you can
    do with a polymer plate (with varying levels of result; however, polymer doesn't
    do transitions well, so I'd steer clear of photogrpahs or vectors with gradients,
    etc.).

  body: "And for plates with no adhesive on the back you have two choices: spray-on
    adhesive (3M makes a good one apparently), or a high-magnetism Bunting base, which
    is <cite>really</cite> expensive. BTW the degree to which you need any adhesive
    at all (the point is to prevent drift down the press every time you roll) depends
    on: how small your plate is; and how important (vertical) registration is. For
    larger pieces in one color and loose margins you're generally OK sans I think.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    fonts cast really large - they came out nice. The only problem with the wood backing
    and the magnesium face is they're pretty susceptible to warping and oxidization
    respectively. But often you just use these things once, plus it's cheap enough
    to have replacements made as needed.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>\"but would be incredibly expensive.\"</em>\r\n\r\nPhotopolymer plates
    are not too expensive, luckily.\r\nI guess if you want to make very large, like
    poster size, plates it can be. But I made a polymer plate of about A4 size the
    other day, and it only cost me about.. I don't know, about \u20AC5,- or less ($6.50
    or something) plus a couple of euro's for the film. \r\nThose were the kind with
    no adhesive or anything, but with a metal back. So it can be mounted and made
    type-high with a magnet on the press."

    program (um, in this day and age, maybe I should say in any Adobe program\u2014actually
    anything PostScript) can be reproduced via the letterpress process. So it doesn't
    matter if you have altered the tracking. Your file would be made, initially, into
    a film negative, which is then processed as a photopolymer plate. When mounted
    type high on a base, it can be printed letterpress.\r\n\r\nPrices have not changed
    significantly from the 1990s but do vary slightly from processor to processor.
    I'm a processor so take that as you may. Of course, you do need a press to print
    this stuff. And, as mentioned, a base.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bieler Press\r\nhttp://BielerPress.blogspot.com"
