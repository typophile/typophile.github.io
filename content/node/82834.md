  nothing in certain areas of certain characters. I don\u2019t have an example handy
  right this instant, but I can probably come up with some if no one knows what I\u2019m
  talking about.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, can someone explain why this is?"

  body: "I think it's just a result of writing with a brush. As you lift the brush,
    particularly when changing direction, the stroke width thins and can break entirely.
    So writing a glyph like \u304D (ki), the last stroke can either be continuous,
    or thin/break at the bottom of the first segment, and you'll see variations of
    that in fonts.\r\n"
