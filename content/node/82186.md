  body: "I think this has been customized quite a bit, but the closest resemblance
    I could find was Bitstream's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-735/\">Modern
    735</a>. The serifs on yours are more bracketed and the K has only a half top
    serif, but the 'g' does have one of the most similar 'ears' I could find to your
    sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
