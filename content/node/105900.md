  But there's a couple things I'm wanting to do.\r\n\r\nWe do a lot of engraving on
  a router where I work. And this is mainly just me being curious. Is there a way
  in FontLab or anything other building tool, to design a single line typeface, so
  that it keeps the same stroke width through different point sizes?\r\n\r\nFor example,
  at 72pt, the typeface will appear thin, but when dropped down the say 6-8pt, the
  typeface will appear heavier. What I would like to do be able to do is start designing
  a font family for different size engraving bits, as well as Regular, Condensed,
  Expanded variants."

    by interpolating between the extremes. You could base the fonts on skeletal paths,
    applying different amounts of stroke value (Contour > Paths > Make Parallel Path
    in FontLab) according to target size.\r\n\r\nThe more dif\uFB01cult method would
    involve metafont technology, although it is potentially the most elegant solution."
