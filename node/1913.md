body: This logo is for a company called Sleep Solutions. They do testing for sleep
  apnea. I am happy with the icon for the most part, but the type is what I am exploring.
  I used Optima on this because it is soft. I would appreciate any comments regarding
  the logo. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19696.gif"

  body: the icon is nice Tom! <BR> <BR>But the Optima seems &#34;just kinda placed
    down there&#34;; there&#39;s no integration. <BR> <BR>Personally, Optima reminds
    me of Real <BR>Estate or Banking...but that&#39;s just me. <BR> <BR>I do think
    you can find something more integrated than Optima. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Tom -- I agree with BJ about the nostril. I don&#39;t think it is necessary.
    Also, I think that the nose should either fall short of the box or be cropped
    by the box, but not rest on the edge of the box. And maybe the hair shouldn&#39;t
    be quite to perfect, meaning a little more modulation?

    be a little more &#34;frame-like&#34;? This might help Optima seem more appropriate
    with its own stroke variation.

    is best. I don&#39;t like my logos to be extremely long or tall &#40;unless it
    is appropriate&#41;. I also like the icon being the most important thing, and
    any other way I have tried the text becomes the focal point. In cases where I
    have to fit the logo in a rectangular area I will make the icon smaller but keep
    it in the same place. I also have tried smallcaps and all lower. Smallcaps comes
    on too strong. all lower doesn&#39;t seperate the words enough &#40;I&#39;ll be
    lucky to get my client to go without the period and spaces&#41;. I have attached
    a version all lower. If you all think it works I will try and talk them into it.

  body: Mike&#39;s idea doesn&#39;t look bad, but I think the frame width/weight should
    equal that of the bold type, or vice-a-versa. Maybe even try connecting the letter
    extensions &#40;i.e. &#34;p&#34; decender, etc.&#41; to the frame

  body: 'Taking Mike&#39;s idea up, you could make the line dividing illustration
    and text follow the text height &#40;all the same weight&#41; and be a wave looking
    like a pillow the girl is resting on. The outside box could be a different weight
    from the divider.  <BR> <BR>Being not a designer gives me this perspective: I
    think you designers looking at this stuff all day get jaded on a good type design
    much sooner and stay that way much longer than the public who is going to look
    at your work. This is something I think to take into account, eg. when considering
    Optima, which I think suits this design very well. '

  body: If they&#39;re stacked, maybe you should use the same font for both words.
    Perhaps the Solutions &#40;luckily, with no decenders&#41; could be cropped into
    the frame at the bottom

  body: I&#39;m not real familiar with type design, but I do know a bit more about
    design in general.  One of the biggest problems I have with this design is the
    tangent formed by the bottom curve of the nose and the frame.  It&#39;s the most
    awkward point of an otherwise effective illustration.   <BR> <BR>The horizontal
    solution seems solid, balance-wise, except that all of the movement in the illustration
    is pointing out of the frame to the upper right.

  body: The problem with the half moon being used in the type is that powerade and
    many other companies use the concept. I like the horizontal design but I agree
    with Scott. The vertical seems to work better. I will work with putting the text
    in a box and work with the font selection. I think adding any boundaries to the
    text takes away from the illustration. &#40;I just got moved in and unpacked so
    I haven&#39;t been able to work on the logo&#41;.

  body: er..yep, i know, its a rough version trying to explain what I mean to the
    guy! As much as I enjoy posting on this forum to try and help people develop their
    ideas, I&#39;ve not got the time to spend hours getting it all just right. I think
    what I posted was enough to get over the point I was trying to make...sorry if
    I&#39;ve offended you or something. <BR>
