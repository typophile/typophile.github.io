  of the font. It's from the Jane By Design Logo...\r\n\r\nCould anyone help me identify
  this font? I usually post stuff on WhatTheFont and usually they respond but nobody
  did then I came across this forum. What font could it be? The y and the b and d
  are so weirdly shaped, I have't seen it in any other fonts. Somebody help?"
