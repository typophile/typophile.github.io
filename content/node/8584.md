body: I&#39;ve got a strange problem trying to use OTF&#40;CFF&#41; fonts made in
  Fontlab 4.0; Everything looks good, all works but I can&#39;t apply &#34;bold&#34;
  or &#34;italic&#34; styles using hotkeys, only from font menu. <BR>When I generated
  these fonts i used the Font Family Naming recommendations of Adam Twardoch &#40;<a

  but the problem remains.  <BR>Thank you

  body: Vitaly,  <BR> <BR>please tell us which operating system you are using and
    which applications you are testing on. Even better, contact FontLab support&#42;
    and provide us with the sample files. It&#39;s not really possible to answer hypothetically.  <BR>

  body: I use Windows XP pro, FontLab 4.04. OTF was generated from type 1 and tested
    on InDesign 3.0 under Windows XP and MacOS-X 10.3.7 Now I&#39;ll generate these
    OTF once again to post it as attachments. <BR>But it seems strange that this problem
    never appeared before, because it apperaed with any settings and from any source
    fonts i used; and i thought that may be this feature &#40;idesign hotkey support&#41;
    simply requires some option that is not evident <BR> <BR>Vitaly

  body: Vitaly,  <BR> <BR>1. Do the hotkeys work in other OpenType fonts?  <BR> <BR>2.
    Have you set &#34;Font is bold&#34; and &#34;Font is italic&#34; in Font Info
    of the appropriate fonts?  <BR> <BR>3. Generally, I would recommend upgrading
    to FontLab 4.6 &#40;or perhaps waiting until FontLab Studio 5.0 comes out and
    upgrading then&#41;. Since FontLab 4.04, quite a few things were fixed in FontLab&#39;s
    OpenType support.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.

  body: These hotkeys works with Adobe OpenType fonts that comes with InDesign. I&#39;ve
    opened these fonts in FontLab looking for a differences with my fonts, but except
    Features in OpenType panel and some copyright and encodings info found nothing.  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;Font is bold&#34; and &#34;font is italic&#34; are set correctly. <BR>

  body: After some tests i found that this problem appears only when opening existing
    type 1 fonts. Creating a new font gives a good result. So it has no practical
    interest for me, but may be important for those font developer who convert his
    old type 1 fonts to open-type. <BR> <BR>Thank you. <BR> <BR>PS. Moderator, please
    remove my previous post with the attachment. <BR> <BR>Vitaly

  body: And I also promise to pay closer attention. We shouldn&#39;t be uploading
    fonts to the server at all. If this needs to happen, perhaps the proper channel
    would be to e-mail someone directly with the files.
