  body: "Great suggestion (as usual) by Kevin with Sisco, probably the best ready-to-go
    option. But I don't think it's the one. Mainly because of /R (over-)extended leg
    and even if it means customization, I'd rather think it's [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika|Klavika]].
    Some details are off (but easily customized) like crossbar-less /G and /Y fork
    position. Klavika is actually used all over their identity from graphics to print
    materials and packaging. They also use [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Titillium|Titilium]]
    for their [[http://www.thegrayl.com|online identity]], also similar to Klavika.
    \r\nA better look to their logo (from this [[http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52a101f6e4b0ddb9096493f1/t/545ad15fe4b042d9849e64be/1415237983158/20141103_GRAYL_CUP_MANUAL_v1r6.pdf|PDF]])\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5125.png]"
