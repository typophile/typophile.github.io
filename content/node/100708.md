  one notable thing is that both Roman and Italic in all four weights (plus two stencil
  styles) are what I call uniwidth, meaning a given glyph is the same set-width across
  the board. I'm a fan of that sort of thing, but I thought that beyond a narrow range
  of color it backfires (based on my work on Patria, where I made the Regular and
  Demi uniwidth, but resorted to what I call \"fixed-offset\"* for the Light and Bold**).
  Any opinions from users or observers welcome.\r\n\r\n* Which is where two fonts
  become uniwidth when a certain tracking value is applied.\r\n\r\n** Which is even
  pretty light for a Bold.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Sans</a>, by the by. Consistent width across four weights.\r\nWhich is not possible
    within the Cyrillic script due to some different italic forms, but possible in
    Latin and Greek."

  body: "Pablo, J\xFCrgen, I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know about those being
    uniwidth! Thank you.\r\n\r\nLinotype has a nice history of \"normalization\" (e.g.
    Compatil) and Kobayashi is a major talent so I'm sure they did a good job with
    those. However Axia's weight range (from Light to Black) is a good deal bigger
    than those (as well as Asap's and Mantika's), which is why I wonder how well it
    works. In my experience the <em>widths</em> of the \"outlying\" weights have to
    strain too much to accommodate being uniwidth; the Light becomes too wide, and
    the Black too narrow. But maybe I'm missing something.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>you
    mean like Linotype</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you mean the 18-unit (or later 54-unit)
    system, not that either; what I mean is that the \"a\" for example is the same
    set width in any weight/style. Or maybe you meant Linotype's \"duplexing\", where
    the Italic glyphs matched the set widths of the Roman ones; that's closer, but
    nothing to do with <em>weight</em> throwing a wrench in it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Memphis Medium duplexed with its Italic, or you could get Memphis Medium duplexed
