  on the sugar daddy/ sugar babies candy but have had no luck. If someone can please
  let me know what font they think it is I'd be very thankful. Here's a link to a
  pic of the font http://tootsie.com/img/sdSbLogo.gif (I've also added it as an attachment).\r\n\r\nThanks
  again"

  body: Hmm... I looked around for as many modified fonts of Futura that I could find
    and none were really close. Thanks for the post though.

  body: It's probably not a font. A lot of candy packaging has lettering that is drawn
    by hand. You might like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mvb_fonts/mvb_grenadine_two/?sample_text=SUGAR%20DADDY&sample_size=36">MVB
