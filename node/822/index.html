  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I recently came across a &#34;Lots-o-Fonts For a Pittance&#34; CD that I&#39;d actually never seen before. Curious what was on it, I forked over the few bucks and discovered that it was full of Brendel Informatik fonts. <BR> <BR>I know what this company is about and, sure enough, I recognized lots of commercial clones as well as ripoffs of a few of the early shareware font folks. Plenty of just plain junk as well. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, there are about 14 fonts/families on the CD that caught my eye but which I don&#39;t recognize. I&#39;d like to occasionally post one for your ID perusal so as to learn of the original font where possible. <BR> <BR>The first is called Albany &#40;occasionally, the name comes into play in the form of a weak pun on the original font&#39;s name. Macbeth gets the name Hamlet on the CD for instance &#41;. The last line in my sample image uses a very similar font on the CD called Sirius. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13763.gif" alt=""> <BR>I know it looks like one mighty crappy font, but I can&#39;t help but wonder what a well done original might look like. I really like some of the basic letterforms. <BR> <BR>Earlier this year, Manfred Klein offered a creation of his called <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein03/index.htm" target=_top>HerdeckeSans</a> &#40;look toward the bottom under Text Fonts&#41; that surely had the same inspiration. Trying to research that name Herdecke online got me nowhere. <BR> <BR>Any ideas? <BR><br> <BR><br></div>

		<div class="commentbody">According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is creating their version of "Andromeda" and being cloned as A775 Deco, which feature the same uppercase and lowercase character sets as the design of FontBank's Andorra plus more symbols/punctuation and international characters were added, which join numbers and some symbols/punctuation.   The font itself is finally appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0" (for home users) and "infiniType 4" (for designers), which were both being released around May 27, 2014.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments Mike. Apparently BuyFonts.com has a license to distribute the FontBank fonts. They have a copy of the FontBank license agreement, I believe, on their site attributing these fonts and their copyrights to FontBank. Mine not to ask why, it&#39;s just nice to know somewhere they can be found. I still get a lot of ID requests that were fonts they had in their collection.  I wish I could also find someone distributing NovelFonts. That was another set distributed by Tiger Direct in the mid-90&#39;s in the Expresiv Ornate collection. Anyone know if they are still out there?</div>

Would <BR>be very helpful. <BR> <BR>But the fact that it&#39;s not distributed anymore is a blessing <BR>to all those who designed the original fonts that were  <BR>swiped and sold by those knockoffers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I provided the link as confirmation from the source that &#42;most&#42; of the Expresiv Fonts CDs &#40;via Tiger&#41; are, as he says, no longer available. <BR> <BR>I see now what you mean about the Ornate/NovelFonts. <BR> <BR>BTW, I mentioned the urgency I sometimes feel to hunt up the original font for a knockoff. Just last year you helped me via e-mail to ID <a href="http://www.casadyg.com/" target=_top>Casady &amp; Greene&#39;s</a> Gazelle as the original for a clone I had and liked very much.
