  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm looking for any and every suggestion Typophiles might have for resources on using and creating [[typographic ornaments]], both how-tos and examples. I mean both senses of "typographic ornamentation":

 -- the ornaments that come as glyphs in fonts (and so ideas on how to arrange them in layout programs like InD), and

 -- the use of typographic glyphs (ornaments and otherwise) as ornamentation or illustration, as in for example the <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/books/typotheque_posters">Jigsaw specimen poster</a> that Typotheque released.

Again, any and every idea, personal favorites especially, would be welcome. Thanks!</div>

I don't know of any book per se, but certainly a cruise through the work of Bruce Rogers would give you lots of inspiration. 

Another person who used ornaments with great skill is Fred Anthoensen, the scholarly printer who worked in Maine for most of the twentieth century. He did lots of work for the Peabody Museum of Salem, Massachusetts Historical Society, etc. Here's just one example of his work.

Hey, folks, what do I do here? I wanted to include a picture with my post. After I wrote my little paragraphs, I clicked on "insert image," browsed to the location I wanted, added the jpeg picture, and watched the byte counter go up to 253. Pushed "post comment" but when I visited the real deal, no picture. What am I doing wrong?

Hank, exactly (one of) the right idea(s). De Does's Kaba stuff is a great example of the typographic ornamentation in which I'm interested, though it's a real b***h getting hold of his stuff when you aren't plugged into the type/design world professionally.</div>

I think there is a list of books that Dwiggins designed--this includes emmbossed ornaments on the covers. I bet Tiffany can give you the reference if there is. Then you can go into the University library and really have some fun looking at these. If you've got a scanner handy post some of them for a treat for the rest of us!</div>

Dorothy Abbe's (she was his assistant in his last years) book called "Stencilled Ornament and Illustration" (Boston Public Library, 1980) is also chockablock full of great things, although in this case it's his own delicious, home-made decorations rather than traditional metal flowers.

Most of you will know the Caravan ornaments that he did for Linotype, as well.

And yes, you are so right about the spine ornaments! Here's just a few of his books gathered together, all letterforms done by hand.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shelfbacksfoil600_4532.jpg]</div>

The following comes from <em> A Suite of Fleurons </em> by John Ryder, Phoenix House, London 1956. 

It's a small (privately published?) index of eleven historically significant ornaments with 'how-to' examples often placed on the facing page. I dunno where you might find a copy outside of the antiquarian booktrade or the university library interloans service. I picked up my copy for $10 – but then, I <em>am</em> Mr lucky-in-the-bookstore (!) 

This material would be (as Tiffany says) the shiznit on a Flash-driven website... you could have the arabesques dancing all over the place.

This question/topic is going to cost me; I've been able to track some of the books mentioned here in our library's system, and I found the ornamentation samples on Lanston's site, but de Does's <em>Kaba-Ornament</em> is nowhere to be found--so I wound up buying a copy from Nijhof and Lee's in Amsterdam, on the strength of the small bits reproduced in Mathieu Lommen's book. I'd be happy to return Bruce's posting favors when it arrives.

Why couldn't I have asked a question about something nice and cheap?</div>

This is about 4.5 x 2 inches (11 x 5 cm). This took me several hours of work. Unlike straight comp, you are always having to think in two dimenions at once, measure but also depth. And this is an easy one because everything is square (unlike the sailing ship, which is almost unimaginably complicated). [img:sites/default/files/old-images/metal_ornaments_4284.jpg]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, in my mind they are different. In normal composition, you have your stick set for a certain measure, and everything you throw in is the same height. You finish your line, add whatever horizontal spacing material you need for it come out full to the measure, then add whatever lead(s) you need, and begin the next line. You are thinking horizontally as you add those last bits of spacing material, so that the line is nice and tight to the measure. 

In the case of ornaments, which may be coming from several different cases and be different point sizes, as you expand your line horizontally, all the inidvidual sorts must *also* attain the same vertical dimension. This is needed so that when the form is all locked up, you have as much squeeze pressure on the material vertically as you do horizontally.

That's what I meant. (Maybe I wasn't being clear, but for me it's a more challenging situation, more brain focus needed at all times.) </div>

<a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000085">Eason's</a> ornament system is especially useful. They are monospaced and divided up for easy layering (multi color use etc). Monospacing ensures perfect registration and you only have to adjust leading in ID to create wallpapers. I'm sure this has some limiting factors too, but I've found it useful. Stephen Coles did a great job with Eason's ornaments in Sota's Interrobang booklet.

When i've used other ornaments, I typically lay them out in illustrator, and import it as an EPS.

		<div class="commentbody">Ben, the question had occurred to me. I mean, I've been reading and posting here for a couple years and I haven't even gotten round to creating a cool avatar for myself. :)

But around the holidays I get some more free time, and I got jealous this year of my sculptor/painter wife who can share her vocation (hence more of herself) with me and our families and friends when she gives presents. Funny thing: my friends and family never want copies of papers I'm working on or lectures I give in my political theory courses.

So, I thought it would be nice to find something among my avocations I could share--type--and ornamentation was what occurred to me first. I may not know nearly enough to do anything for people this holiday season, but I at least can carve out some time to start thinking about what I'd like ultimately to be able to do, and learning the skills I'd need to do it.

And I'm sure that you and others would correct me if I'm wrong, but the people who do ornamentation (as anything) really well, like Bruce and Gerald and Randy and Nick and others, don't <em>find</em> the time, they <em>make</em> it. I'll count myself lucky if I can ever do a tiny fraction of what the folks on these boards can do.</div>

(Edit: There is also, to refer to your original question, Oliver Simon's 'Introduction to Typography', published in the 1940s and 50s by Penguin/Pelican in the UK and probably distributed by someone else in the US. This should be cheaper and easier to find than the other source I mentioned. A relevant page is below.)

I am about to make more time to devote to typography by retiring from my day job. As of June 1st, I will have unbound my shackles (and reduced my income).  
I don't plan to sail like my friend Gerald Giampa--unlessyou count the winds blowing through bezier curves :-)
Jim, if you see Gerald, send him my regards!
