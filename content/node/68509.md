body: "\"What is the quickest way to replace paragraph styles in a large number of
  InDesign documents?\"\r\n\r\ni've designed a large typeface family for a large client.
  they've had the beta version for a while, and already used it extensively.\r\n\r\nwe
  just installed the final version, which has its new final name, and partially renamed
  weight names too.  opening their many files now, they get \"missing fonts\" alerts.\r\n\r\nsince
  it is their first custom font, they are understandably surprised, and frustrated
  that they might have to re-spec so many docs one by one.  isn't there any way this
  process could be reduced / simplified / expedited, via macros, scripts, actions
  or such?\r\n\r\nthe team uses mostly mac OSX, but the rest of the corporation mainly
  windows XP (seems the only common platform for all international offices).  their
  main softwares are InDesign, Keynote, PowerPoint.\r\n\r\nthanks much for any help!"

  body: "Hi Joachim,\r\nhow you\u2019re doing?\r\n\r\nYes, there might be a solution
    to your problem, at least as far as the InDesign documents are concerned:\r\nHans
    Haesler offers some terrific javascripts. You want his \u2018SchriftenTausch\u2019.
    The scripts can be downloaded free of charge from <a href=\"http://www.fachhefte.ch/java_scripts/\">www.fachhefte.ch</a>:
    choose your platform (OSX or Windows; D is the German version, F is French), and
    then your InDesign version. You\u2019ll find SchriftenTausch.sit and SchriftenTauschDatei.sit.
    The files come with a Read-Me file that has instructions in German \u2013 I guess
    that\u2019s just fine for you.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFlorian"

  body: "In InDesign, the Book feature solves this.\r\n\r\nFirstly, make a backup
    of all files (as they will be changed).\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>. Edit the paragraph
    styles in one of the documents.\r\n<strong>02</strong>. Create a book (File >
    New > Book). The Book panel will appear.\r\n<strong>03</strong>. Include all files
    you need to change in this book (plus sign).\r\n<strong>04</strong>. Set the changed
    document as origin of styles (icon at left).\r\n<strong>05</strong>. Use the synchronize
    command from panel menu.\r\n\r\nSync will apply the same styles for all documents
    in the Book. The styles applied are those from the origin document. You can change
    sync option from the panel menu.\r\n\r\nBe aware that Book would change page numeration
    of files you include in it. You can disable this option from the panel menu. You
    can also change page numeration back with a double-click in the page numbers shown
    in Book panel.\r\n"

  body: "Are the final fonts absolutely identical to the betas except for the names?
    \r\n\r\nIf not, it would be a good idea to review each document after the change
    to make sure that there weren't any unintended consequences. For example, in InDesign
    the tiniest change to kerning, etc. might cause a line break somewhere to change,
    which might make a whole paragraph reflow, which might make a page break change,
    and suddenly one or more pages look screwy or have a text overflow."

  body: "The procedure Igor (Freiberger) suggests is the way to go <strong>if</strong>
    all documents are set up properly and use styles with consistent naming. I assume
    this is hardly the case (\u2018large client\u2019). The script catches any font
    specification, even if it was applied manually, without styles."
