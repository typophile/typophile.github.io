  The work is still in a very early stage as you will see. Personally I think it&#39;s
  perfect and I&#39;m ready to go on with rendering. I need you, experienced type
  designers, to assure me and give me pass before I continue. I am worried about the
  dimensions &#40;too wide/too thin&#41; of some letters &#40;M, T, W and 4&#41;.
  Some letters, which include round parts, are missing. <BR> <BR>This is how the font
  is initially supposed to look like:  <BR><a href="http://www.stud.ntnu.no/~kovalev/bilder/Bilde-1.jpg"

  body: This reminds me of a similar font &#40; it had a folded structure too&#41;
    we saw here a while ago but I see you have worked out a method for making the
    folds automatic instead of intuitively. I readlly like the early images. The structural
    honesty is nice. When we go to the all black version I think some of the charm
    is lost. I think that you may be adhering to your rules a little to closely for
    some of the characters. The T &amp; X for instance. Why not use two pieces of
    ribbon rather than one? The A on the other hand uses the idea of continuous ribbon
    &amp; the quirks &#40;charcater&#41; you get to great effect. <BR> <BR>In you
    post you say that letters with round parts are missing but the images you link
    to have rounded parts. I am confused. <BR> <BR>Regarding the P &amp; B &amp; C
    - &#40; <a href="http://www.stud.ntnu.no/~kovalev/bilder/Bilde-2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.stud.ntnu.no/~kovalev/bilder/Bilde-2.jpg</a>
    &#41;  I like them. You could go more angular &amp; reduce the number of folds
    too. <BR> <BR>What about decorative endings at the terminal end of the ribbon?
    What about an overflay font or two that could fill in the ribbon, maybe with altrenating
    color? <BR> <BR>Anyway, I like it &amp; I hope you finnish it. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: All the characters use a kind of flattened ribbon. What if some of it was
    allowed the ribbon to drape or curve or twist? That would give you some additional
    forms to work with. Intuitively it seems like a few curves, or drapes could add
    balance to the face and give you a more complex/richer rhythm. I don&#39;t think
    the face aught to be more frou-frou or lacy. Maybe just less tight. I really like
    what you have done.

  body: 'Hello, Eben. <BR>You&#39;re right, I myself like the early thin version better,
    so I&#39;ll stick to it then. Thanks for the replies, btw, new ideas are rushing
    over me... Decorative endings have been pursuing me from the very beginning, but
    I havent been able to find a way to implement those endings in the way I wanted
