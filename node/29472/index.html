<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
This logo is for a farm in Puerto Rico. They are looking to market themselves as an agro-tourism destination and they will sell coffee and tangerines using the brand. They want a an upscale/quality feel, not a traditional agricultural look.
What do you think?
Thanks,
Edgardo

<div class=commentbody>In my opinion a nice Serif would give this a much more elegant, upscale and quality feel. Specially with that background pattern. Or perhaps some humanist sans. Something that has a bit more stroke variation.
What does the circle represent? I see a sun. What's the concept?
The colors seem to match agricultural-feel.
Hope this helps.

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, the colors represent agriculture. What I ment by agricultural-feel was to avoid traditional elements like obvious leaves, rivers, mountains, trees, crops, etc.
The main concept is the environment of the Hacienda. The "levels" you feel when you go there, the soil, the mountains around and the sky. The circle put it all together and represents the products. Using the star to represent the sun also segments the circle which produces pieces similar to what you find when you cut an orange/tangerines or other tropical fruit.
Thanks for the feedback.

<div class=commentbody>Great direction.
I support what Kco suggested about using type with some visible "stroke variation", or perhaps making some subtle alterations to the existing type to accomplish the effect. As for the background pattern, it seems a little too linear or digital. Maybe along with humanizing the logotype, you can humanize the pattern a bit. I guess it depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
Aloha!</div>

I interpreted the logo as intended before reading your description.
It was immediately obvious to me that it was ground, mountains and sky all brought together by the circle.
Great colour palette too.

<div class=commentbody>Hi guys,
Thanks to all for your replies. I have a question... a concern really. I worry that changing the font might make the product feel too upscale/luxury related and might affect retail sales with a higher cost perception. What do you think?
Thanks again,
E.</div>

<div class=commentbody>First, i like it as it is, logo and font. Maybe a bit neutral.
>I worry that changing the font might make the product feel too upscale/luxury related
I think the guys ment, that you can give it some more human touch with a serif/slab. Your use of the chosen font, which is an extended weight and all written in caps, goes in the upscale etc. direction already. I would try a slab, to check out how far i could go, for example with a slab-serif. Standards like PMN Caecilia, Scala Serif, to see how it works together.
What you could try otherwise, following "the more human" direction, but stay "clean":
I like the combination Avenir, Scala Serif a lot. Avenir has this slightly constructed feel and still being friendly. And Scala Serif for text. Both works good together, has nice contrast.
Just my 2cents</div>

<div class=commentbody>really nice.
I think the shapes (mainly the sun shape) could be tweaked to be a bit 'stronger'. but I really like it. and the colour choices too.
Not completely sold on the text - as others have mentioned - but then I'm not entirely sure what it says either.<br>

<div class=commentbody>i love the colours used and saw they represented soil, trees or grass and the sky. immediately madew me think of farming. i'm liking it. i love the one on the left because of the colour pallete you have used. it gives it some deeper meaning where as the one on right cant be interpreted by me as soil, grass and sky but if it was really really well established like for decades and decades, then it's ok coz it's well known then but i think you should go for the one on left. i think you should leave the font san serif coz if it was serif, it would look too luxurious and upper class etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It doesnt have to be a Serif typeface. I see the shape of the icon mos as an organic shape even though it's geometrically placed. Your typeface seem soo straight, geometric and every stroke is the same width. Look at the top of your "A" and its very squared wich your logo isn't.
just my opinion,
Kco</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think I've ever recommended it before, nor have I used it for logotype before; but, Optima seems like it may be a perfect match here. Its letterforms seem to have some resemblance to the shapes within the graphic.

<div class=commentbody>I agree with your concern. It's a very good logo, but at present it looks very corporate, like a massive global oil/drug/agro conglomerate whose executives sat down in a city boardroom and said "can the boys in marketing do something to make the consumer perceive us as more 'green'?"</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was thinking Optima as well (and I'm not likely to recommend that either).
If you're really set on a sans, Optima might be a good solution or maybe something that's a little less "hard" at the edges? Trying to set the type smaller might actually work with your font.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd be inclined to put a little more space between the logo and the name as well, and maybe look at the proportions. There isn't a lot of synergy between them (what my old boss called "sing").
Overall though, quite nice indeed. Its heart is in the right place.</div>
