    this: for clean look,  Typewriter from Font-Bureau; for more "typed look", Underwood

  body: "Good find, Bob.\r\nThe font <a href=\"http://www.myfont.de/fonts/infos/6416-Underwood-Champion.html\">Underwood
    Champion</a> also has the letters that match the sample. \r\nI believe that we
    can infer that the clean font in the sample was also based on an Underwood Champion
    typewriter or another typewriter using the same key faces or element.\r\nThe font
    \"Underwood Champion\" was created by Vic Fieger in 2008 and is being distributed
    through a German website. So <em>possibly</em> the clean typewriter style in the
    sample was created by a German designer not selling through MyFonts. But then
    again, it is <em>also</em> being distributed through various non-German sites.\r\nDon"

    Typewriter and if you want to duplicate that font you need to buy one on e-bay
    or as below. \r\n\r\nAnother source for the Vic Fieger font is http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Underwood-Champion\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderwood
    Champion Portable of 1938\r\nYour Price: $625.00\r\nFor a machine of this size,
    the Champion certainly had a lot of punch! These were introduced in the late 1930s
    among a full line Underwood's portables, but Champion was the top of the Underwood
    Typemaster portable line. The numerous Underwood Typemaster features, that once
    only available in an office-sized machine features, were standard here, including
    the Champion keyboard, sealed-action frame, dual-touch tuning and an inbuilt tabulator.
    In the 1940s, Champions were chosen by the U.S. Army for their ease of use, excellent
    durability and proven reliability in all sorts of conditions. The early version
    came in three glossy colors: black, maroon and green. Charcoal gray crackle paint
    and improved plastic key tops was common in later versions. (A carrying case with
    typing stand was also offered at the time as an optional accessory for both Universal
    and Champion models.)\r\n\r\nhttp://mytypewriter.com/underwoodchampionportableof1938.aspx"

  body: "An alternative is to find the <em>original</em> not a carbon copy of a US
    Army report of the era typed on a fairly new well maintained typewriter. By well
    maintained I mean a neatness obsessed clerk took the effort to clean the typefaces
    with a brush so that they shined. No way to tell except by looking at results.
    Prospects of finding a good specimen range from good to impossible. Might even
    be something with excellent scan resolution at archive.org.\r\nBut this is more
    typical of what I found so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1945-07-07excerpt_4879.jpg]\r\nGiven
    your review of the significance of this particular machine, it would certainly
    be a worthwhile project to do a clean font based on it.\r\nDon"

  body: 'Since P22 says: "This font is primarily based on the typewriter used for
    a typographic conference document from 1966 in Mainz Germany. The model and age
    of the typewriter used is not known.", we can assume that Underwood Champion models
    had a long period of use. Lurker''s sample has the number 1993 in the first line,
    "moved to Site 19 1993", and if that is a date it would be really close to the
    end of the typewriter period, and even then mostly the IBM Selectric was what
    had persisted. I was working in museums then and we kept a manual typewriter around
    to fill out shipping forms - I do not think it was a Underwood Champion. '

  body: "I learned to type on a Royal portable in high school. A great cost saver
    when I went to university and saved the expense of 25\xA2 a page for essays &
    term papers. Later, in the era when professionals had secretaries who churned
    out dictated stuff on IBM Selectrics, I managed to get my hands on a big old Underwood
    or Remington and typed out private notes. If you are careful not to make mistakes,
    keep the typefaces from getting clogged, change the ribbon regularly, and the
    machine has not been abused, the output looks pretty good. It does <em>not</em>
    jump all over the place like the ersatz typewriter fonts. So, I tend to agree
    that in view of the reference to 1993, Lurker's sample could indeed have been
    a typed sheet and not a digital font.\r\nDon"
