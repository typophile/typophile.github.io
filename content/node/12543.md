  I thought I would get some feedback on the proper use of small caps.\r\n\r\n<strong>So,
  when is it, and when is not, appropriate to use small caps? Should they always be
  used with acronyms in body copy? And should \"small caps\" be written with or without
  the dash?</strong>"

  body: I understand using small caps in place of all caps for acronyms, however,
    it is extremely ... ok, maybe not extremely ... annoying at the beginning of sentences.
    So, that said, if someone is going to use small caps for acronyms please have
    your copy-writer re-write the sentence to put the acronym elsewhere in the sentence.
    Other than that small caps aren't so bad in place of all caps. Hmm. Ok, well it
    the text has a lot of acronyms either small caps or caps will stand out... my
    2 bits.

  body: It seems odd to make a copywriter rewrite every sentence starting with an
    acronym. Writers at NASA would have to write nearly everything in passive voice.

  body: "Christian, I was being a little sarcastic and unrealistic, I realize this,
    but I still think small cap acronyms at the beginning of sentences looks worse
    that all cap acronyms. The reality is, of course, that it is most likely unavoidable.
    But a girl can still have her opinion.\r\n\r\nOn second thought, however, if one
    is lucky enough to have a copywriter involved from the word go, why not have the
    watch for that and do their best to avoid it as many times as possible?"

  body: "I think it depends on both the context and content. The context contains
    the particular typeface and style and the \"company culture\". The content may
    dictate as well.  If one book is just riddled with acronyms, you might want to
    tone them down with mall caps.  If another book or article wants to place greater
    emphasis then keep them all caps.  I don't think the number of letters should
    dictate small caps though.  Consistant usage is important. What if I had a string
    of acronyms, would I only small cap the longer ones? Think of a sporting event
    where colleges played eachother and the local paper said, \"UCLA beat UC by 20
    points but UNLV was trounced by OU 100 to 10.\" \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "We recently grappled with this in our publications. They are, in some sections
    more than others, rife with acronyms like JMSB, CA, CMA, CIAC etc... as well as
    with degrees (BA, BComm). I would have liked to make them all small caps, but
    so far the university's style in all other publications is BA, PhD, BComm and
    so on, so it wouldn't fly. \r\n\r\nWe ended up doing small caps for all non-degree
    acronyms except \"IT\" which would have been confusing in certain sentences. It's
    consistent in an inconsistent way ;) But certainly (in my opinion) better than
    JMSB appearing 10 times all caps in one column. Only one occasion did the acronym
    begin a sentence. I believe I all capped it because no other acronyms followed
    and I (unfortunately) have no lee-way for those kind of edits.\r\n\r\nK.\r\n"

  body: "Hrant has a good point.\r\nI should add that if the type has a small x-height,
    this allows a largish small cap, quite distinct in size from both lc and caps
    -- and that is often the kind of face that has alternate small caps.\r\nSo it
    can be problematic for many publications that require large x-height faces for
    copy-cramming purposes.\r\nYou also have a situation where the capitals are themselves
    quite small, much shorter than ascender height. For instance, types like H&FJ's
    Mercury offer a solution -- where an all-cap setting is not particularly obtrusive.\r\nHowever,
    I have come to the opinion that I should produce amply sized small caps in all
    my faces, even those with smallish capitals to begin with.\r\n\r\nAnother factor
    is tracking. Traditionally, small caps had very spacious sidebearings, for a reason.
    But that doesn't seem to be the case for most digital fonts. "

    address the sad reality that virtually nobody bothers with smallcaps. It might
    even make sense to provide an adjunct set of <cite>large</cite> caps, for use
    by those who are savvy enough to notice!  :-/\r\n\r\n> small caps had very spacious
    sidebearings, for a reason.\r\n\r\nBut I think the main/good reason -that all-caps
    looks best when loose- is still valid in the digital world - beside the fact that
    you don't need to file down sidebearings on tight caps any more!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It is my practice to set acronyms with small caps, unless they are spelled
    with full stops between them, as e.g. the initials of a name, as in Alexander
    A.M. Stols. Small caps would be confusing, but caps would be obtrusive. In that
    case I use caps, but slightly vertically scaled, at e.g. 95%. This however is
    not an entirely satisfying solution because of the distorted weight (i.e. no true
    optical scaling). The ideal were typefaces that offered caps, small caps and something
    in-between, but properly designed to fit the overall weight of the face.
