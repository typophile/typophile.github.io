  body: I wish there were counters inset within the appropriate letters... At least
    D & O. Maybe 9 as well...

    look like if it was a high contrast font.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about a kind of
    abstractly outlined Broadway (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/broadway/),
    but I'm not sure that's what you're thinking about.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for
    your feedback."

  body: "Nice concept. I'm think of a magazine page where a headline and a summary
    is set with this font so that the whole page is full of it. could be very interesting\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious what a 'C' will look like. \r\nAnd what about giving variations of connections
    - for example to have a connection of the E to the right not only from the bottom
    but also from the top ...\r\n\r\nAnd what about ornamental characters which can
    be used as a border or just to fill space?"

  body: "@FixB : Yeah I think it could be great to have some variations to make different
    connections between letters, and I also tought a bit about making ornements. It
    could be funny and push the puzzle & labyrinth effects further.\r\n\r\nBTW, It
    could be very interesting to have vertical ligatures with OpenType, even if I'm
    not aware of such thing.\r\n\r\n@brockfrench : Thank you for your drawing! I understand
    your idea and I also thought about making it this way, but I soon left this idea
    because my goal is to make characters with connecting lines only.\r\n\r\nI think
    adding inset forms this way would make them look heavier and focus too much the
    reader on.\r\n\r\nAlso, I admit I didn't really followed my rule for the punctuation,
    but I think it's better like this to let the whole thing breath a little.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help.\r\n"

  body: "Fun! I'd say wire up the ampersand. While the V is fine, you may want to
    see if a V more in the style of your Y would be better.\r\n\r\nSome users will
    probably want a plain intersection to use instead of a space. Since an alternate
    space glyph may be hard to implement, you could probably make it the plus sign.\r\n\r\nThe
    exclamation point will be a challenge... I imagine a straightforward solution
    would have inadequate impact. Maybe the glyph could be like three exclamation
    points."

  body: "Thank you for your help Cerulean, sorry for the late answer, but I thought
    I'd be better with an update of the font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KKpreview_4164.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    agree with all your points, I was also thinking about a Y-like V and of course,
    I wired the ampersand. I'm still a bit lost with my exclamation point, for the
    moment I've just an \u2014 easy \u2014 cutted line, so it's less impacting than
    !!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nAlso, I've got a minor bug when I export my font, on Illustrator
    when I write an apostrophe i've got a 'quoteright', but on TextEdit it's working
    well. Anybody has an idea about it ?\r\n\r\nPS : The diacritics overlap negative
    is just a bug."

  body: "Hi Bernard, it's definetely a good step further. I'm still waiting for the
    different connections. And I think your diacritics should be rethought. They are
    a little too small. And your \xA3 seems a bit strange, probably it needs a second
    horizontal like \u20AC.\r\n"

  body: "I would recommend connecting the C to the right from the top terminal, not
    the bottom terminal, to avoid possible confusion with a G. Also, the opening of
    C is very small, so the other terminal should probably stop where the \u20AC does.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some places where more of a sense of connectedness could be achieved by trimming
    off part of a glyph to make an intersection into a bend. The bottom of @, for
    instance, could stop at the middle, making it a continuation of the connector.
    Maybe the same for 9. The top of & could be open for a similar connection on top
    (and I think your first & had better proportions and angles, especially if you
    take this suggestion).\r\n\r\nFlxB, \u20A4 is a symbol distinct from \xA3; while
    both can be used for pounds sterling, one stroke is more common for pounds and
    two strokes is used for lira."

  body: cerulean, thank you for this information but since the euro is official currency
    the symbol for lira could be neglected?!?! Or do you think there has to be distinguished
    between these two?!?!
