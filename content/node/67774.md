  United Church of Christ's [[http://www.ucc.org/beliefs/statement-of-faith.html#DOX|Statement
  of Faith]] and am having trouble deciding on which font to use. \r\n\r\nI am presently
  leaning toward Scala Sans Light. To my (amateur) eye it's fresh, non-authoritarian,
  and has a sense play - all things I would like to convey.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have
  any other suggestions?"

  body: "Scala Sans does seem to be a good choice given your intent, although it seems
    to me to be a bit too plain. Clearly, you don't want, say, Wedding Text, since
    that would produce the opposite of the effect you are pursuing.\r\n\r\nMurray
    Hill and Park Avenue aren't right either; but I would be inclined to suggest some
    sort of light, playful face that still makes a nod to the past by being calligraphic.
    But I can't find what I'm thinking of, although Tiffany, Bauhaus, or Korinna might
    (or might not) work for you."

  body: "Thanks so much for all the suggestions!\r\n\r\n@ quadibloc - Bauhaus felt
    very close but a bit funky/techy and not as spirited as I was hoping for - good
    food for thought though.\r\n\r\n@ John Hudson - Socianist Sans would be an apt
    choice considering the denomination has a strong unitarian strain running through
    it. What do you think of Pelagian Pro?\r\n\r\n@ cuttlefish - Beorcana is absolutely
    lovely and, dare I say, near perfect for this project. \r\n\r\n@ Northbay - Caslon
    No540 is great but I think I'm going to go the sans serif route. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again. I will let you all know what I decide. \r\n\r\n"

  body: I think these are all in the Beorcana vein, but does anyone have any thoughts
    on Chianti, Goudy Sans, or Sebastian?

  body: "Now that I'm at home and can look at some specimen books, I see that it was
    Park Avenue, which is not suitable, that I was thinking of. But now I've found
    something that may be like what you're looking for... Studio. However, I see that
    there are now several completely different faces with that name, and the one I'm
    thinking of is the one from Mecanorama.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/list?2+Studio+2+6K9+16+CDW+0+DXT+0+47H+0+MU6+0+MU7+0+MU8+0+376+0+8KE+0\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/studio/\r\n\r\nAdams,
    from Canada Type, is close as well:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/adams/\r\n\r\nBilled
    as \"a revival of Dolf Overbeck's Studio typeface\", I suppose that's not surprising.\r\n\r\nHaving
    the point to start from, I found a different face that might also be what you're
    looking for, or at least what I thought you were looking for:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roundy/\r\n\r\nRoundy,
    from Linotype.\r\n\r\nOr Galahad, from Adobe.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/galahad/"

    Augustinian Roman. Glad you got the joke though.\r\n\r\nSubversively, I'm going
    to suggest <a href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/trinite.html\">Trinit\xE9</a>."
