  body: "<em>Just for my own understanding</em>\r\n\r\nThere are two different ways
    of describing figures (as represented by Quark XPress and InDesign), and I've
    mixed them up in that chart, which isn't correct.\r\n\r\nThe icons are supposed
    to represent the four figure qualities: \r\nProportional, Tabular, Old-style,
    and Lining, \r\n\r\nrather than the four instances:\r\nOldstyle Proportional \r\nOldstyle
    Tabular \r\nLining Proportional \r\nLining Tabular \r\n\r\nSo to indicate the
    four instances, I should have done this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figs_5801.png]"
