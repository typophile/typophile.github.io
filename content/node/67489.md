body: "I am proud to finally announce the release of Otari. It can be purchased at
  <a href=\"http://www.tktype.com\">TK Type</a> or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tk-type/otari/\">myfonts</a>.
  A version of the bold weight, with a limited character set, is also available for
  free on either site.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtari is vibrant and contemporary, but serious and
  built to last.\r\n\r\nIts character shines in display type, but doesn\u2019t interfere
  at text sizes. Otari aims to capture the essence of Wellington, New Zealand in a
  single typeface. The contrast of a colorful art scene and the conservative colonial
  British aesthetic, which is still evident in the capital city, laid the groundwork
  for this design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otari1_5110.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otari3_4765.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otari2_6380.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n<a

    forget \"friendly but authoritative\" :-)\r\n\r\nThe semiserif-italic pothook
    fusion in the roman is a cool idea, nicely done."

  body: Thanks everyone for your kind words. Bendy, I tried to send you a message
    through typophile, but am not sure it went through. Please email me at design(at)traviskochel.com,
    or let me know how I can get ahold of you. I just wanted to send a token of my
    appreciation for your critique on the early stages.
