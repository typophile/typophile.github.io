  Day in Type</a>. \r\n\r\nThis Day in Type is a collaborative venue for typography
  that uses the day's date as its subject. Guests may submit artwork for a future
  date in hopes that it will be selected for publication.\r\n\r\nIt's in preLaunch
  right now, but you may submit art to it for June 1st onward at any time. And please
  email me at horton[at]thisdayintype{d}com if you find any bugs or turkeys. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder,
  This Day in Type\r\nthisdayintype.com"

    it also has a web based BBS. I sent in a graphic for the gallery. What do you
    guys think? \r\n\r\nHorton, how do you see your site vis a vis Typophile?"

    body: "Interesting question. Typophile is much more \"referential\" and \"insider\"
      than I intend for This Day in Type. I want to create a venue for great typography
      \ in action in a way that the general web public can appreciate. Its about type
      expression.\r\n\r\nThe BBS on the site is really there to discuss the artwork
      for This Day in Type itself. It does allow for some overlap in type discussion,
      but I am skirting outright war :). \r\n\r\nTypophile is the dairy commission;
      This Day in Type is a farm real estate agent. (One of my crazier metaphors.)\r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder,

  body: Horton, do you have plans for providing the images as a (RSS) feed? You know,
    I'm sure there are people out there that would be keen to have his/her desktop
    background image change everyday, and the pictures submitted to [[This Day in
    Type]] could be used as a source for that.

    body: "Thanks for the interest. There is already an RSS feed available at the
      bottom of all pages. Yay! For those of you using Macs or iGoogle, I am going
      to release widgets (or gadgets) that also automatically display the day's date.
      I know Vista and others also have this capability, but I don't have access to
      them at this point.\r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder, <a href=\"http://www.thisdayintype.com\"
