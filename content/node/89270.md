body: "I hereby announce the release of some new Andron fonts.\r\n\r\nThe popular
  Andron-2-English font is now completed by an Italic and a Bold version:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANDRON_G2_ENG_2_5971.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  Andron-2-Deutsch sort is now grown to a family of its own by three new and rather
  peculiar fonts. There is a new Italic and a new Scriptive, and Andron-2-Deutsch-Laendlich
  explores the possibility of a different approach to Capitals. This variation has
  been inspired by the base glyphs of \xA3, \u20AC and $ which dwell in each font
  but hardly count for a model usually.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AND-2-DEU-LAENDL_5449.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANDRON_G2_DEU_2_6235.gif]\r\n\r\nMoreover,
  the new Italic and Scriptive fonts of Andron 2 contain a splendid set of fancy classic
  ornaments:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANDRON_G2_ENG_orn_4545.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  ornament selection is also available separately, as \u201CAndron Ornamente\u201D.\r\n\r\nA
  scriptive version has also been added to the Andron-1-Latin family.\r\n\r\nAll new
  Andron Fonts are available now at [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/SIAS/|MyFonts]].\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    lately if something like this has been done."

  body: Very nice work! I think the unicase /a/ is also very cool. It works better
    than I would've anticipated.
