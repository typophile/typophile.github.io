  but the 'S' and especially the 'G' look pretty different.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gmi_reg_6339.jpg]\r\n\r\nDINCondensed
  comes pretty close too but the stem and the shape of the G doesn't look correct
  to me.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else have an idea?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nKind
  regards,\r\nC."

    you sure that all samples are using the same font?"

  body: "fvilanakis,\r\n\r\nthanks for your input. Actually, I have just realised
    that the 'E' is different. I am only assuming that the fonts are the same. Atleast
    the first part 'D-AG' looks pretty much the same.\r\n\r\nKnockout #31 is a good
    start and I haven't come across that font yet. But the shape of the spur on the
    'Q' and 'G' are not correct in my eyes. Is there a font which atleast has got
    a similiar 'G' spur?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nC."
