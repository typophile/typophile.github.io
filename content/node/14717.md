  you''ve just had your 12th cup of coffee and nothing is going right. Stop. Push
  yourself away from the computer get your field glasses and head to Central Park.
  Go to the Ramble and look for the Fall Warbler Migration. From about the beginning
  of August to mid October the Warblers will be coming through Manhattan with the
  peak in mid to late September. '

    Morrocan Mint. I have a friend who told me that there are phytochemicals in tea
    that counteract caffine. All I know is I don''t have nervious hands and I don''t
    have highs and crashes in my blood sugar anymore. '
