  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was looking at Gunnlaugur Breim's rather amazing site again today and I found this:

http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.08.bad.shapes.htm

It's all about really troublesome letter combinations for both setting & design of fonts. The combinations he deals with include CT, HJ, & rv.

Looking at the word 'October' in caps I am noticing that some fonts solve the problem with comparitively a closed C. These include: Bell Gothic & Univers. When I look at other type designers I notice the C&T are kerned quite heavily & closer than I would have imagined before I looked: examples are Scala, Fago, Georgia, Legato & Kepler. In fact, that seems to be the usual method for fonts with a cap C that is more open in shape. The only other varient I have found so far is similar to the closed gothic C : Courier, Times, Big Caslon and Zaphino all use substantial serifs which pair with the down serifs on the T to even up the Notan. 

I am collecting examples like this now for a Notan related project. So my questions are: 
<ul>
<li>What do you think of Breim's examples of 'Bad Shapes'?

<li>Do you have combinations any to add? Maybe a list of Semi-bad shapes? 

<li>How do you solve for Breim's Bad shapes? Are you happy with the solution?

<li>Would you consider using an alternate form of a 1st, 2nd or both letters to solve the problem instead? (Using Opentype scripting to detect the combination & swap in a varient glyph/s?) Why or why not?

<li>Calligraphers & Stone Carvers have a lot more leaway to deal with these 'Bad Shapes' than we traditionally have as type designers. Would you be interested in a collection of examples that shows how they handle them?

</ul>

		<div class="commentbody">Type design criteria are multi-variant, so solving a problem of fit in one place may create a problem of fit elsewhere. Hrant's example optimizes the r_a combo, but until one knows how this particular r combines with other glyphs that follow it, or how this particular a combines with other preceding glyphs, it is only a partial solution. However, as this is one of the problem spots, it is a good place to start.

Contextual alternates can be useful, but they don't have to be drastic. Here's a "ligature" that I'm considering. (Left: basic, right: contextual alternate)

		<div class="commentbody">1) Of course the adequacy of a pair's spacing depends on what's around it*, but when you bring a given pair closer in color to the mean, it's inherently a good thing** because more often than not it will help. Furthermore, since both the left of the "r" and the right of the "a" are very "solid", it's pretty much ensured that you will not end up with an unusually large gap on either side. BTW, a telling question: do you space the left side of your "k" different than that of the "h"?
2) The "a" there has a "soft" top-left (in fact, top) not because of the "r" - that's its normal form - it's because I think such an "a" contributes more to readability.

* Try to space "LAWYERING" and you'll get it real fast!  :-)

** Although it's still always important to remember that there's such a thing as too much even color.

		<div class="commentbody">Or try this text:
The adequacy of the spacing of a pair depends on what other glyphs it is likely to be adjacent to. By the same token, the adequacy of the spacing of one side of a glyph depends on what the other side is doing. The most prominent example is the "r": when you know that the right side is always going to be a little loose (because otherwise it means its black body is dysfunctionally narrow and/or the beak crashes into bunches of things) then you make the left side slightly loose as well, to -gently- propagate the (un)even color. More subtly, the inevitable looseness on the right of a "k" (relative to the "h") means that it benefits from a slightly looser left. Mind you, we're talking about a distinction of ems you can count on the fingers of one hand; ignoring this refinement (what I call "intraglyph color propagation" - please don't shoot me) will make nothing stand out too much, since there are bigger (unavoidable) spacing imbalances "built-in" to any (conventional) font (and to some extent, alphabet). But like a somewhat long right foot-serif on an "r", it helps just that little bit.

On top of fixing the spacing it would also make for better boumas.

Also, if you kern things like Ya really tight, are you also going to kern space_Y, becasue if you do you will get stuff like f_space_Y where the f bumps into the Y. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">RE: Protocol. It does seem likley that different people will find different techniques work better for them than for others. David Berlow is quotes as saying he works from a-z. Not what the type design experts suggest... but I love his work. 

<cite> And by distributing a little bit of gapiness throughout a face, an excess of grey combos is mitigated. </cite> 

This is wonderful. Do you think that the gappiness adds flavor to the font? Do you think it creates an eveness of fault? Or do you think it's a feature that adds to the font's readability? Or are all of these thing oversimplifications? 

What occured to me as I read this is that theoretically ( practicality being something else again ) you might be able to use contextual adjustment to make changes that alleviate the need for adding this gappiness. That is, asuuming that the gappiness was minor sort of 'fault'. But maybe that's the wrong sort of idea. 

If the Gappiness was introducing contrasts or thinking of Peter, a useful 'cue' into a glyph/bouma, you might be able to create or admit more variety of contrasts into the face by using contextual adjustment to permit this greater dynamic range without letting it break the continuity of the face. The r & g might be examples where their excess' could be caught by more contexual adjustment rather than tempered.

The Wh example you gave seems like an instance of the 1st type. The Egypt example seems like an instance of the 2nd type too me.

I am not sure there is a right way of doing any of this.

But what do you think?</div>

Of course, and they do, but at the same time, if the proportions of the type, when set, create an harmonic effect, that makes reading smooth and pleasurable, like chocolate. I don't think that these principles are mutually exclusive, but both required.

Food provides nutrition = words provide meaning
Food tastes nice = type has a pleasing appearance, golden section and all that stuff
Food goes down easy = type reads easy

Comfort is a big factor in extended reading, or else you'd never finish a page.

The biggest. I just don't think harmony has anything to do with it, and I also
don't think there's anything smooth about it (not perceptually/mechanically).
And to me the difference is <cite>entirely</cite> based on whether it's conscious or not, so you
can't get anywhere meaningful without that context.

<cite>I just don’t think harmony has anything to do with it</cite> 

Hrant: Nothing at all? What word would you use to describe the repeating shapes with variations? Or for that matter - what's wrong with rhythm? I often wonder if there is something in this distiction or if it's just hand waving & semantic choices that are different - that it's word choice rather than substance that is the point of disagrement. Not that word choice is irrelevant, but it can ditract from the meat of issue at times. I say this because I find it hard to imagine that some degree of harmony isn't needed to balance distictiveness of individual glyphs. And that is what I think I see in type faces of all kinds now.

Or maybe you do want to reduce 'harmony' and replace it with bristle! What do you think?

<cite> I tend to think this is exactly the sort of thing that makes a face too gray.
Let the letters contribute their individualistic notan “skew” to boumas. </cite>

I can imagine a result where greyness is acheived -or- one in which more color & distictiveness is added. Wouldn't you need to look at an example to know which one was happening?

BTW - I found some more 'bad shape" combinations to ask about. I was thinking that rather than make blanket statements it might be useful to chew on some specific pairs & triples. To look at what is happening in them & then to comment - maybe each pair should be it's own thread. What do you think? If I plan to compare the difficulty of the combination with frequency data so we can talk about the more relevant combos 1st. I haven't done it yet. it could be that the most used pairs & the most difficult pairs are not an overlapping set. Or it could be the difficulty is more design specific than I realize.</div>

Pattern. It's just not romantic enough for some people I guess. They need to be hearing music <cite>all the time.</cite> Take a break dude. Like I've noticed I drive better when the radio is off.

Ask them to fix the archives.

Bristle? Good name for a font.

Indeed, but it's not a formal visual harmony, not the naive stuff Modernism teaches us. It's the Heraclitian harmony, the deeper one. The one that says the glyphs in a font need to come together "virtually" to promote readability = form good boumas.

The words people use are charged. They have strong <cite>non-literal</cite> associations, and this motivates their use to some extent. For example when some people use "rhythm" in discussions of type design, when you put them on the spot they'll improvise a revised meaning for the term and won't admit that they started using rhythm in the first place because they actually want there to be a flow, even if they know -or are made to realize- that there can't be.

I think there can be exceptions, but my point was that introducing <cite>gappiness</cite> (something qualitatively more than "looseness" in my mind) promotes gray to the point of reducing readability.

Heraclitus: ἁρμονίη ἀφανὴς φανερῆς κρείττων. "The hidden harmony is better than the obvious one." I don't think complete works by him have survived however.

Glyphs coming together: many type designers note that a font is a beautiful collection of letters, not a collection of beautiful letters. And how could a <cite>collection</cite> be "beautiful", except non-formally, non-obviously?

As for boumas, please see my article in Typo#13.
