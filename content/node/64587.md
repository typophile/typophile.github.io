body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been designing a font for the 3D environment, where
  each letterform is able to stand alone, up right in the 3D; even the lowercase letters,
  numbers, question marks etc.\r\n\r\nIt's largely inspired by engineering and building
  rather than traditional font concepts \r\n(i.e. Readability, onscreen adaptability
  etc.) BUT I have not used massive slab serifs or made overly angular/sharp corners.
  \r\n\r\nI'd love to know what you guys think of it. As I'm more of a typographer
  than a type designer. . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test-1_4226.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test-2_6728.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/test-3_5405.jpg]\r\n\r\nany
  feedback / help would be great. . . cheers."

    is already a typeface named Balance!

  body: "I'm not a type pro, but the question mark looks off to me, especially the
    negative space. Like a Picasso nose/face.\r\n\r\nTotally different too, but I
    had thought of this Cube font: [[http://fontfabric.com/?p=111|LINK]]"

    BUT I think this font is ready for the metaphorical shelf. . . at least for now.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again. cian."
