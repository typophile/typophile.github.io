body: "Hello Everybody,\r\n\r\nFor the past few days I've been working on a new typeface
  called Sensa (http://typophile.com/node/77453#comment-444957\r\nIn the first test
  prints the stems on d h p q h l b, etc (basically all stems that touch the ascender/descender)
  appeared much to thick. It seemed that the smaller the size got, the thicker they
  looked. Logically I made them thinner and they look fine to me at text size now.
  I thought it was problem solved until Nick Job noticed that those stems looked a
  little thin. They look fine to my eye (also on display size), but perhaps my eyes
  have got used to the thin stems. So I would like to know if anybody else has ever
  encountered this problem (if it's there in the first place) and how to deal with
  it. I suggest you print the pdf because it might not render the way it should on
  screen. \r\n\r\nMerry Christmas,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A lot depends on the device and paper. Putting ink on paper can have unpredictable
    results. How things look coming off laser or ink-jet printers -- even the so-called
    \"high end\" digital presses -- is different than how they look coming off an
    offset press. As far as that goes, type will look a bit different on different
    papers, or from different offset press setups.\r\n\r\nI would keep the stem thickness
    the same for ink on paper.\r\n\r\nFrom some of the discussions on Typophile, something
    similar can happen with pixels on screens."

  body: I can't imagine my printer decides to make all long vertical strokes a tad
    thicker. Off coarse every other paper or printer gives a different result, but
    the change will be either consistent, or not consistent at all. Making long vertcial
    strokes thicker is not consistent, nor inconsistent. What happens on screen is
    a different matter. I'll focus on print for now.

    you ever thought of rounding errors? I've found I can't finalize kerning with
    a 1200 dpi laser printout. Have to wait until the book is printed offset. Even
    with determining the proper distance between say, the stem of the \"i\" an the
    stem of the \"f\" in the f_i ligature is difficult using the laser printer. Pick
    the distance that looks best on the greatest number of occurrences, then wait
    for the book for any final correction.\r\n\r\nBTW, you can taper the long stems
    in the middle for a little thinner look."
