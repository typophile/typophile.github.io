  date on the book, I believe it must have been printed in the begining of the 20th
  century.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\nYago[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C_5715.jpg]"

  body: "Yago, you have asked a number of questions about old type, but the samples
    you have shown are often just a few letters. Do you have the ability to provide
    more images? If you have access to these books, but not a scanner, perhaps you
    can use the Serif Font ID Guide to identify them yourself. It comes up in Google
    search (usually I would put a link, but I'm using an iPad and making links is
    not easy).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
