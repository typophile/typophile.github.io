body: "Hello, \r\nexcepted for script and italic use, I\u2019m asking myself why not
  putting something like\r\n<code>sub f' [b h k thorn] by f.short;</code>\r\ndirectly
  into a <em>Liga</em> feature if I want it to be active by default of course.\r\nOr
  to put it into <em>Dlig</em> for \r\n<code>sub f' [ b h k thorn] by f.dlig;</code>\r\nassuming
  f.dlig has a different letterform than /f/ and /f.short/\r\nIf I should put it into
  <em>Calt</em> instead, what would be the reason to it?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nJan"
