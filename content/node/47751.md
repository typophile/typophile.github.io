  \ I lost my fonts in a hard disk crash and I can't find it anywhere.  \r\n\r\nIf
  it's not been pulled for some type of copyright or propriety issue, I would love
  to have it back.  My email is typophile@lob.ws.  \r\n\r\nIt's the font used for
  \"The Women of Rodgers & Hammerstein\" in this graphic:\r\n\r\nhttp://lob.ws/nlad-public/NLAD.html\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n-Stuart"
