body: The non-italicized font is Janson Text, but oddly, text in italics seems to
  be another font? The f, for one, is quite different. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID

  body: Is this a book or magazine? How new is it? What a strange form for the w.
    That is a beginning line character being used within the text.

  body: Looks just like Linotype (metal) Janson to me. There was also a "recut" version
    that was slightly less eccentric.

  body: 'Clarification: Some of the Linotype italics had very odd proportions due
    to the duplex nature of their fonts--the roman and italic had the exact same metrics.
    The "recut" versions were separate from the duplexed versions, allowing the correct
    proportions to be used in the italics.'

  body: This is from a book published in 1962. What is meant by a "duplex nature"
    to the font? What was the impetus for creating the metal versions? How do others
    feel about the look of it as opposed to the standard italic?

  body: Linotype machines had a "magazine" which contained matrices (moulds) for two
    fonts at a time, but both fonts had to share the same character widths. Basically,
    there were two styles of a character on each matrix, and of course each matrix
    has only a single width. This was called "duplexing". It was convenient because
    you could use two styles in the same line of type (roman + italic, or roman +
    bold), but sharing metrics meant that compromises had to be made in the design
    of the fonts. For example, for serif typefaces, the italics are traditionally
    narrower than the roman. When they duplexed a serif roman and italic, it was usually
    the italic that suffered most since it was probably not going to be used as much
    as the roman. Linotype also issued "true cut" italics for situations when the
    italic was going to be used alone, when the compromised metrics were unnecessary.

  body: "The standard duplexed italic version of Janson is problematic for me so I'm
    after the metal or true cut versions (or are these the same?). I've searched these
    a few times on Linotype's site but fail to come up with them. Where are these

  body: "It appears that the Linotype digital version of Janson does use the \"true
    cut\" italics. I'm not sure if the duplex version has ever been digitized. Still,
    Linotype's version isn't the only one available. There are lots to choose from:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/janson/fonts/\r\n\r\nNote
    that some versions are called \"Kis\" (after the name of the punchcutter who cut
    the original) due to trademark reasons."

  body: To my eye, these other versions actually don't appear quite the same, seeming
    to lack the width of the example above and the f is certainly different. I would
    love to find this face...it would be very useful in recreating the text.

  body: "If I recall properly, the metal type was created at Stempel during the 1950s,
    under the supervision of Hermann Zapf. Stempel would have later adopted the design
    for Linotype matrices, which are duplexed. But when Stempel made the phototype
    version (if there was one\u2026) or the digital version now distributed by Linotype,
    their basis would have been the metal version, not the metal one. They would not
    have gone back to these intermediary, duplexed Linotype matrix designs.\r\n\r\nThe
    Linotype\u2014duplexed\u2014version would have represented a design compromise
    intended just for typesetting with the old Linotype machine. The \"proper\" design
    would have been the hand set version, which would not have been duplexed (i.e.,
    no weird f). There is no need, when there is a good hand setting model, to also
    convert the Linotype version to photo/digital/etc. I understand what you mean
    when you say that a digital version of the Linotype matrix version would help
    you reset the text, but really, the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. Everything
    is going to be slightly different in the present digital version\u2026 i.e., the
    letterspacing is most likely different now, so you wouldn't be able to easily
    maintain the same line wrap anyway! Just reset the document and use a similar
    point size, leading, page size, margins, etc. That is enough, I think.\r\n\r\nDon't
    worry about this thing with the wonky italic\u2026 the Linotype machine version
    that you are looking at is a work around, not the \"proper\" version. The current
    digital version is closer to the \"proper\" design. Using that is better ;-)"

  body: I very much see the difference in this text which makes extensive use of this
    wonky italic. This is, I should mention, work for a family member of Richard Neutra.
    The text is Neutra's, and if he had any oversight at all in its layout, then it's
    best to recreate it exactly as he intended. Posted here is the actual page and
    the recreation with standard Linotype versions. Comments welcome.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID2_3470.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID3_4405.jpg]

  body: "I don't know\u2026 back in the early 1960s, you had a lot less typeface choice.
    I doubt that Neutra <em>decided</em> that this book should be set on a Linotype
    machine, and then printed from that type. Most likely, he and the publisher selected
    this option because it was the cheapest and/or most convenient option. Hand-setting
    the whole book would have most likely been too costly. I doubt that a whole lot
    of books were still being handset in the US in the early 1960s.\r\n\r\nOnce the
    decision to use a Linotype machine was made, then Neutra and the publishers would
    have only been able to use whatever fonts that particular shop had in stock. Janson
    Text would have been one of the newest (and best) options at the time.\r\n\r\nYou
    aren't going to find an exact match of the design you want, because no one has
    made a digital version like that (with good reason, I think). But you can use
    the digital font that you have to better approximate the feeling of Linotype Machine-set
    text. Try these two steps: Turn off all Kerning in the document. So you'll be
    using NO kerning pairs (the Linotype Machine did not support them). Then, you
    could letterspace all Italic text passages a bit. This won't give you the wider
    letterforms you want, but it will open up and widen the text, and that will give
    a very close impression. Typography isn't really about individual letterforms
    anyway. It is about how they all come together\u2026 what the pattern is. You
    can approximate one books pattern with similar, but not exact tools. I would not
    see this as being detrimental to Neutra's legacy at all."

  body: "I agree with Dan. There\u2019s no way to look exactly the same, except scanning
    and reproducing. Even in the remote case that you could get (or design) a revival
    of this italic, technology printing is different now, so you can\u2019t get the
    same feeling. \r\n\r\nIf you compare, let\u2019s say, Adobe Garamond with an original
    sixteenth-century Garamond, differences are notable. But Adobe Garamond still
    a very accurate revival. \r\n\r\nSpacing is wider in the original, too, for italic
    AND roman. If you follow this in your digital font, it may generate a very loose
    aspect.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry about it, it seems that it\u2019s the closest
    you can get \u2014unless you can do it in a Linotype machine. I\u2019d be more
    worried about false small caps and errata (INTSTRUCTIVE).\r\n\r\nBut if you really
    want to look exactly the same, don\u2019t forget Perpetua on the headline. ;-)"
