  I'm wondering what font I should set it in. Also other fonts that would compliment
  well as a header font. Thanks!\r\n-Jesse"

  body: Oh my, anything could do. Perhaps ask John Downer, perhaps the only type designer
    who is also an avid water polo player. He'd be thrilled you mailed him.

  body: "anything :~/ I think that's my problem with type. It seems so daunting to
    me that I can't really narrow type down from everything. So many choices...\r\n\r\nBut,
    I would love to email Mr. Downer. Is he a member here?"

  body: Can be daunting, yes. Since the subject matter doesn't help us much on this
    one, start with some simple descriptive words, feelings. What is the attitude
    of the publication? Who is the audience? Modern, tough, aggressive, bold?

  body: "hmm, I would say agressive and Modern sound good. It is just a personal book
    for myself but I would still like it to look nice of course. There are illustrations
    but i need to re-illustrate them. The paragraphs can be short or complex depending
    on the drill.\r\n\r\nWhat other questions should I be thinking about like the
    ones you have already asked?"

  body: "Some more questions that need thinking about in conjunction with type choice\r\n\r\nWhat
    size is the book? (do you have a measure or a grid designed?)\r\n\r\nHow is it
    being printed? (in colour, b&w, laser, lithography; encapsulated to waterproof
    it)\r\n\r\nShould the audience be able to read it in a group? (and in this case
    perhaps be in a pool and showed the book from the edge)\r\n\r\nIs it important
    to have the whole drill on one page?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks timd! \r\n\r\nFor now I am just printing out the book on my nice hp
    7310. But Once i finish it I will probably want it printed at a shop and either
    on water proof paper or encapsulated (i've never heard of this before unless you
    just mean like laminated?). Now that I think about it the shop can probably print
    at a variety of sizes, any suggestions on what sizes I should consider?\r\n\r\nRight
    now I am thinking of doing it spiral bound with tabs for the different sections.
    Does anyone know of a website that specializes in this with short run jobs?\r\n\r\nThe
    only audience will be me and the other coaches. So the kids won't need to see
    it. The drill explinations are fairly short so I don't carry them over to the
    next page.\r\n\r\nSolipsism: i am assuming that is a sarcastic answer?"

    specimen book</a>, could be an idea.\r\n\r\ni printed a page of it on my inkjet
    and of course an intensive showering spoiled most of the ink away, but maybe with
    laser it will be different. get some samples from a paperstore that has it and
    just try. either way, its a great paper that will easily withstand wet and steamy
    enviroments. a lovely paper."

  body: "Well, I imagine that a US equivalent of A4 (210x297mm) used landscape, with
    binding on the long edge will be the most useful, you will be best to choose a
    standard size so that folders, wire bindings or envelopes will fit easily and
    so your printer will run them without need for trimming. \r\nEncapsulating is
    covering both sides and extending to protect the edges, laminating is protecting
    one side, but these terms are interchangeable in most circumstances.\r\nI guess
    this is leading to a sans at quite a large size (14-18pt) with generous leading,
    the choice is still daunting, maybe try a whole selection of typefaces with a
    page of live text, print them out and whittle them down to what you feel works
    best or that you find most attractive. Helvetica may take a bashing these days
    but it can work.\r\nTim"

  body: "Not sure of the <em>normal</em> hierarchy, but my first thoughts when faced
    with a project are how is it being produced (size, printing, stock, finishing),
    who is the audience (age range etc.), what is the content (images, illustrations,
    tables etc.) and what is the point of the piece (information, advertisement, promotional
    etc.). Other questions spiral from this. I don't really put one point as more
    important than the other.\r\nTim"

  body: "Keeping the questions that timd poses foremost in your brain, decide on one
    element (whether that be a color, a typeface, a style of illustration, etc.).
    It's sort of an arbitrary decision, but you need a starting place. All other decisions
    and all other elements need to bear some relationship to this first element.\r\n\r\nAs
    you apply more elements, you might decide that your first (arbitrary) element
    needs to be changed or modified. \r\n"
