    around for that in a long time so I don't know if that is still the case.\r\n\r\nEvery
    anecdote I hear about Godaddy hosting is a nightmare, but I don't have personal
    experience."

    the cheapest host around, but the quality of service is fantastic. The servers
    are rock solid and secure, they have a good web interface for SQL stuff, and the
    tech support is great if you need help."

    look into Media Temple, DreamHost, and Tilted.

    and have been doing so since a few years and I am pretty happy with them. (I never
    really had any problems and their packages are cheap as well. And forget about
    GoDaddy. I had a domain there about 9 or more years ago, moved it somewhere else
    soon after and still get their newsletters, even when I opted out several times
    since then.)

    customers... I use [[http://krystal.co.uk|Krystal]] in the UK for my VPS and dedicated
    box - they are a great set of guys, and their shared hosting is excellent value
    - and they DONT oversell each server, so performance is great. Plus, you get to
    talk to human beings, and support is top notch. No I don't have shares in their
    company! Plug finished!\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "I would like to also recommend DreamHost.  I have been with them since 2004.
    \ You can host an unlimited number of domains and they provide more than enough
    disk space and bandwith. And you can have multiple user accounts so you can offer
    webhosting to your friends and family and make up the cost.  The one or two times
    that I needed customer service, I got almost instantaneous help by email.  They
    did have a huge PR problem a year ago, when their billing software (with some
    help from its human operator) accidentally charged all their clients for a year's
    worth of hosting.  But I had enough good history with them that I was willing
    to \"cut them some slack\" and trust that they would refund the charge, which
    they did.  The only cost to me was that I had to endure their endless apologies
    and appeals for forgiveness. \r\n\r\nI also recommend DomainDiscover for domain
    registration.  I have been with them for about 10 years I think.  The current
    price is around $10/year for .com, .net, and .org.  If they aren't the cheapest
    on the market, I don't care.  They are cheap enough and their service is good.\r\n\r\nBrian"
