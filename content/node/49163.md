  [[http://typophagy.blogspot.com|Typophagy]] created by myself and [[http://www.loligovulgaris.com|F\xE1bio
  Martins]].\r\nThe above mentioned has the objective of uncovering some essays, thoughts,
  and what-nots about not only typography but also design in general. \r\n\r\nIt is
  definitely yet an up-and-coming project, but it counts on critique, opinions and
  appreciation to go forward. \r\nI post this here because it shares a mutual interest
  and focus with this community \u2013 which in my opinion has exactly the right people
  to appreciate it. \r\n\r\nI know I am not properly what you would call an active
  participant in typophile, but that is due mainly to the lack of time and production,
  as well as involvement in other matters; so this comes as a manner to show the love
  drawn towards the crafts here discussed and practiced \u2013 all of those which
  such visible fullness of heart.\r\n\r\nThank you all already,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9 Reis"

    name. Considering the 'ph' is read as an 'f' sound. Some people might categorize
    anything 'phagy' as a negative word, even though it's not a word at all. The implications
    of what it sounds like are pretty detrimental.\r\n\r\nIs that too crass?  "

    intended to play with that. it's nevertheless always more about the content \u2013
    which is for English-Speaking Typophiles, in response to AzizMostafa \u2013 rather
    than the title (which expresses the devouring / absorption of all we can, relating
    to this matter).\r\n\r\nand, thank you all for the critique already."

    mocking this community at all, or anything of the likes. In any case, i still
    highlight that that reflects the spirit of the blog \u2013 it is meant to play
    with that. Designers used to play with concepts and ideas, last time I checked.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not trying at all to play deffensive on this \u2013 don't take me wrong: I embrace
    your critique, I just think it evades the whole purpose picking with the blog
    title instead of checking for content \u2013 but, if I'm not mistaken the greek
    suffix <cite>phagos</cite>, stands for voracious/voraciousness; as much as the
    <cite>philos</cite> one stands for friend / being friendly (exactly). \r\nAll
    the more one would assume that especially this community would be less impenetrable.\r\n\r\nI
    truly want to thank you all for your opinions and statements \u2013 which help
    in not only the blog's, but in my own personal growth \u2013, that are crucial
    for avoiding future mistakes."

    would like to assume that those that would take an interest would realize that

    it's true. I didn't know of the origins of the proper <i>phagy</i>. However, I
    would put money down that the majority of people would assume what I had. Which
    really is a reflection of the sad state of current intelligence.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    this entire assumption could be turned around and Typophagy could help enlighten
    those that don't understand.\r\n\r\nI, for one, have already been enlightened
    through this thread. So, in the future, I won't make this association again. "

    like that; and for once, I could understand where the misreading came from. Because
    of the original sounding of the word I couldn't see it could be misinterpeted
    for the worse. the feedback \u2013 and being foreign as well \u2013 wasn't properly
    elucidating for me to understand that.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>However, this entire assumption

    to make that up in this thread \u2013 but nevertheless something to be posted
    on the blog. Even so, it is more about the content than the title. "

  body: "Andre, maybe you could have a brief explanation of the coined word somewhere
    on your blog... Or maybe change your slogan to something like \"Devouring all
    things typographic\". I have the feeling that it is rare to encounter \"-phage\"
    or \"-phagy\" in English. At least for us non-scientists. :-)\r\n\r\n(I once ran
    into the term \"coprophage\" in the title of an \"X-Files\" episode, but was already
    familiar with the Spanish equivalent... Same goes for terms like \"phagocyte\".
    Maybe they are more common in Romance languages, in spite of the Greek origin.)\r\n\r\n
