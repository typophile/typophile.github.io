		<div class="commentbody">I have to point out that this sort of thing is a little like going on-line and saying &#34;I have a fever, my throat is sore, and I have small rashes on my skin. What would you guys recommend that I take for it?&#34; Beware any diagnosis over the internet. <BR> <BR>Obviously, there&#39;s a lot more to choosing a book face than just what looks interesting. And without a lot more details about the book brief &#40;&#39;modern and high-tech&#39; are very vague terms and could mean a lot of different things to different people, including your client, these suggestions are only stabs in the dark. <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, let me offer my two cents&#39; worth: <BR> <BR>Scala has turned out to be a decent face in books. It&#39;s spareness gives a character that many would characterize as contemporary. As Hrant points out, the downside is that it is a bit heavily exposed right now -- but that&#39;s not really a primary consideration in book text. I have found it tricky to pair a good display with it because of it&#39;s idiosyncracies. And although I&#39;ve considered it for a couple jobs before, I&#39;ve yet to actually decide to use it. <BR> <BR>Stone and Minion are both solid workhorses. I&#39;ve used both with success. &#40;I just finished a book with Stone&#41;. But I suspect neither is unique enough to give the character that your client seems to be requesting. <BR> <BR>Apollo is a good text face, although I find setting it requires a little more care in handling. Utopia and Kepler both set well right out of the box. Although all three are more unique, uncommon choices, I don&#39;t think any of these are going to give the character you want. I think they&#39;re all a little too soft and classical in feeling for what you&#39;re describing. Apollo feels very oldstyle and usually gives a delicate text. Utopia yields a fairly dark setting and seems a bit too squarish for what I think you might be after -- it seems better suited to manuals and textbooks than trade books. Kepler is a nice readable Didone, being a more jovial take on the class, but I don&#39;t think it is sharp enough to convey &#34;modern, high-tech&#34; &#40;whatever that actually means&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t worked with Avance or the other FF faces mentioned, so I can&#39;t speak from direct experience. I think Avance might make a nice text, but it does seem a little congenial for your title. I don&#39;t think I could advise either Olsen or Zine as book faces. Olsen is very monotone and the x-height seems too large for extended text; I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a fine &#39;jobbing&#39; face. Zine looks interesting, but I only see a Display cut, which is too narrow for book text in my opinion. &#40;I hope Sch</div>

		<div class="commentbody">admitting it&#39;s a bit more classical, why not   <BR>consider <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=FF011178X1P2&amp;start=1">Seria</a> in place of Scala. it was   <BR>designed specifically to correct aspects of  <BR>Scala that were less effective in extended  <BR>text settings. Hrant will likely take issue with  <BR>its nearly upright italic, but I understand a  <BR>more slanted version is in the works  <BR>&#40;besides, it works just fine as it is, IMO&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I realize that this suggestion probably comes too late to help you on this project, but give some consideration to Mendoza Roman as well. Use Linotype&#39;s version -- it&#39;s more complete, and includes small caps and old-style figures.  <BR>  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-mendoza-roman/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-mendoza-roman/</a>  <BR>  <BR>It&#39;s an elegant font that has a nice, clean look.  <BR>  <BR>And it&#39;s French, which is sort of like Canadian. ;&#41; &#40;And yes, I love French Fries and French Toast, thank you very much, U.S. Congress notwithstanding. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#41; <BR> <BR>David</div>
