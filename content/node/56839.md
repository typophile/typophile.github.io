body: "Hello,\r\nwe are helping out with he local pride festival and have been asked
  to design some promotional posters.The very rough idea that has been OK'd by the
  committee is attached. \r\nWhat I am looking for are some suggestions for the typeface
  as I'm feeling a bit stumped with it. \r\n\r\nOriginally I was thinking of using
  a similar typeface to that of a fax or weather report that ships get but I can find
  any references for it yet.\r\nAny suggestions please\r\ncheers\r\nMartin\r\n\r\nPS
  the poster is just very rough work filled with the limited info we have atm, it
  will undoubtedly go through many revisions at the hand of the committee."

    on the suggestion pile for the next presentation with he committee.\r\nMartin\r\n\r\nedit:
    just seen the price of Sauna, its way too steep for the budget, which is a shame
    as it would be perfect, really wish they did a smaller package."

    to use:-)\r\n\r\nNick its pretty hard to economise on a budget of \xA30, and it
    has to be full colour. \r\nI think I will have to put a case to the partners to
    buy Suana for the studio as it's a loverly font:-)\r\n\r\nMartin"
