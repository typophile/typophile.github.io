  the same hight below the baseline as the underscore glyph?\r\n\r\nAnd what about
  the underline thickness? Equal to the underscore?\r\n\r\nthx!"

  body: "I have no idea what the accepted practise is, but it really bugs me when
    a URL uses an underscore and is then underlined as a link and you can't see the
    underscore any more. But that is probably an HTML thing rather than a wider typographical
    problem.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are people here who can be more useful than me
    (I'd quite like to know myself).\r\n\r\nEd."

  body: "accepted parctice is to match underline and underscore.\r\nbut Ed's point
    is a good one. I guess that since you don't have spaces in urls, then you must
    assume that there's an underscore there."

  body: For those poor souls who work in Word or whatever, aligned underlines and
    underscores make for neater-appearing forms...for what that's worth.

  body: "Here's my approach: The underscore glyph is designed to work when it replaces
    a space in word_strings_like_this. The underscore's thickness can matches the
    horizonal stroke in glyphs like \"f\" and \"t\". (You want it to look good, so
    don't match a really fat font with a really fat underscore if it's goofy.)\r\nThe
    underline should similarly work and look good. I make all underline settings in
    a font family the same, quite thin (30 units), and position them approximately
    in the middle of the descender depth. Since underline is either off or on, you
    want to make sure it looks good running through a word like \"jugpoppy\" with
    its many flavours of descenders.\r\nMes deux sous."

  body: "Here I go picking up a very old thread, but it would be interesting to hear
    more opinions on this. I have looked at a whole lot of fonts. It seems that there
    are three different approaches here, well actually more, but if we divide them
    in three approaches, they could look like this:\r\n\r\n1. Underline = underscore
    = same positions and width in the whole family. Light, bold, regular \u2013 they
    have the same underscore/line value. \r\n\r\n2. Underline = underscore = same
    positions and width, but they both change together, depending on weight. Is it
    light, bold or regular; then the underscore and underline also shows it. It \"follows\"
    the other characters, so to speak.\r\n\r\n3. All the others: These ones don\u2019t
    really follow any logic. Underline have one position and one weight and is placed
    below the underscore \u2013 or in the middle of underscore \u2013 or alignes on
    the top of the unnderscore. The underscore could change in weight, but not the
    underline \u2013 it always stays the same.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the ultimate solution
    to this? I think I prefer alternative two, but maybe there is some crucial information
    about this today?"

  body: 'An underscore is a distinct character with special meanings in various scripting/programming/markup
    languages, not the least of which is HTML (principally in frame and window targeting,
    in that instance). In those situations (i.e.: writing code), at least, it would
    be prudent to have an underscore character that can be easily recognized as such
    even when underlined, and not be mistaken for an underlined space.'

  body: As far as I know, no, underlining is not used when programming code. However,
    I could conceive of it being used in textbooks teaching programming, and there
    an underlined underscore might come into play.
