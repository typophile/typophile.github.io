  body: Caslon 337 and 540 have lots of Swash Italics, but this is definitely hand-slaughtered.
    Looks very much like mid-seventies.

  body: I think it was a custom tweak of Bookman -- for a long time, the "New York"
    part was used as the logo for New York magazine.  At least, this was certainly
    the general consensus when I lived in "da city" in the early 80's.  Patty ought
    to have the definitive word....
