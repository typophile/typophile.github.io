  am using Class kerning put I kern OAO and then use the macro to copy those values
  to AC, AG, AQ etc.\r\n\r\nIt speeds the process up and ensures I don't miss pairs\r\n\r\n#Upper/UpperKern---------------\r\n#\r\nfrom
  robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\nkerning = f.kerning\r\n#\r\nif
  kerning[('A','O')]:\r\n\tAO = kerning[('A','O')]\r\n\tkerning[('A','C')] = kerning[('A','G')]
  = kerning[('A','Q')] = kerning[('A','OE')] = AO\r\n\r\nif kerning[('O','A')]:\r\n\tOA
  = kerning[('O','A')]\r\n\tkerning[('D','A')] = kerning[('Q','A')] = OA\r\n\r\n\u2026
  \u2026\r\n\r\nProblem with this macro is it doesn't work with MM fonts. The value
  from one master is copied to the other.\r\n\r\nThe value for 'AO' could be different
  across masters but the macro copies the same value to both masters.\r\n\r\nThe Fontlab
  API KerningPair class says it's MM compatible but doesn't give any examples of how
  to use it.\r\n\r\nhttp://e-font.de/flpydoc/\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how I could
  use FL's API to copy the value of kerning pairs to other pairs.\r\n"
