  body: It looks like one of the <a href="http://www.bestflashanimationsite.com/pixel-fonts/">Pixel
    Fonts created to provide legibility</a> at very small screen sizes in Flash. Of
    course it also looks like just about every screen font when set with an X height
    of 5px and no antialiasing.

    but none of the usual suspects quite match. Verdana is fairly close at 9px.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks guys, it's definitely Geneva. Is there any way to bitmap it? I'm still
    a bit of a newcomer when it comes to typography, do I need some sort of program?

  body: "Well, it depends, what OS are you running? Using Geneva as a bitmap font
    is difficult, if not impossible, in Mac OS X, as it scales type using the PostScript
    outlines by default, and won't allow you to use the bitmap font suitcase without
    its Postscript outline. If you have an older Mac running Mac OS 9.x or lower,
    you can just turn off Adobe's ATM and scale the font to an appropriately large
    size and it'll be plenty blocky. You don't even need Photoshop: you can just use
    SimpleEdit and take a screen shot of the text once you have it entered the way
    you want. Indirect, but it'll work.\r\n\r\nActually, that's a good question: <em>does</em>
    anyone know how to do this with Postscript fonts in Mac OS X? If nobody does,
    benski, and you don't have Classic installed or an older version of Mac OS, you
    might need to get one of the new-school TrueType bitmap fonts, which are specially
    designed to look blocky."

  body: I think the Geneva that ships with OS X is a TrueType font hinted to match
    the old bitmaps at smaller sizes. Turn of anti-aliasing at those sizes and see
    if it matches.
