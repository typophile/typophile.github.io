  advice the Font of this particular image. \r\nas the auto search on the myfont and

  two different type of Fonts in the picture as I believe the other one is simply
  Times new roman; Kindly correct me if i am wrong. \r\n\r\nthanking you in anticipation.

    I know some sites offer it freely and I'm almost positive it was at DaFont so
    I guess it is free for personal use only. So, if you plan to use it commercially,
    I guess you'd have to buy a licence."
