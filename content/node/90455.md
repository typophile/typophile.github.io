  part of their series and now needs some extended characters that aren't available.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  when I try to open the Jensen MM font I'm getting a message saying that it contains
  \"intermediate masters\" that aren't supported by FontLab Studio. We have Fontographer
  5 but that doesn't open them either.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a way of generating
  multiple master instances that I can open in Studio?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen"
