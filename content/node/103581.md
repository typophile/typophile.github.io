  recognize, but all my greek forum attempts failed.\r\nI would like to know if anyone
  can recognize this font.\r\nIt looks like a greek helvetica but all the greek helveticas
  I have found do not have this kind of gamma (\u03B3).\r\nUsually it looks like a
  y but this font has a more rounded lower part.\r\nThank you very much.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spanos_3541.jpg]"

    Greek Linotype Helveticas. 'closing sigma', 'pi' and 'nu' are also different here,
    plus the small tonos mark."

    why I think it is not customised."

  body: There are more similarities to Akzidenz Grotesk Pro Medium, which the design
    of the figure 9 suggests. But 'pi' and 'gamma' still look different.

    and No... Even if I'm clearly not a specialist of Greek fonts. My first thought
    was \"this is not Helvetica, /9 is off. looks more like Akzidenz Grotesk\". But
    after checking the [[http://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/akzidenz-grotesk/proplus/#charset|Berthold
    Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro+ Greek character set]], /\u03B3 was still off (and many more
    actually such as /\u025B). So really don't know what it could be... May be asking
    to specialists like [[http://www.cannibal.gr|Cannibal Fonts]] would worth a shot..."
