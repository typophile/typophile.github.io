  Web Frontoage / banner I do like the Times New Roman Cyrillic despite its common
  use. But a great deal of the other ones look like imitations of the classical instead
  of the real thing.\r\n\r\nAnd also a neoclassical font for the manin body of a website
  text, to make it slick and modern but grounded in the past as well.\r\n\r\nAll ideas
  welcome"

  body: Well with the main body of a website text, you don't have much choice besides
    Times New Roman, Georgia, Verdana, etc. Unless you were to typeset the copy and
    put it as an image (which is not recommended for the primary content of a website.)

  body: "I assume you need the font for the Russian language or Cyrillic. As far as
    web type that has Cyrillic support Times is best choice. I don't think Georgia
    has Cyrillic natively ( you can buy an OpenType version from Ascender that has
    Matthew Carter oft under under-appreciated Greeks and Cyrilics for Georgia). This
    would probably require you embed some how with flash and in that case you can
    use something even more prettier- like Baskerville... it one the best neoclassic
    faces that has Cyrillic support. Its fabulous for text and display.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    allows embedding in all their font products so you don't have to worry about extra
    licensing issues if you go with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/C/C_cyrillic.html\r\n\r\nHope
    I helped,\r\n\r\nMikey"
