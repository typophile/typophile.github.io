  get customer artwork to redraw for our process, and more often than not, we end
  up having to trace fonts.  This gets tedious and time-consuming especially with
  scripts.  \r\n\r\nOur product sees a lot of use in weddings and we end up tracing
  this font a lot.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bergling_5655.jpeg]"

    traced so far.  I had named the file Bergling Script months ago because I had
    done some research before, but couldnt find any font files today. \r\n\r\nBut
    I hope someone can still find a match to my screenshot..."

  body: "I have had many requests to ID these vertical monogram fonts, which I suspected
    existed in the form of engraving plates used by stationers so that they could
    offer something NOT available in digital form. Some of these clients insisted
    that they have seen this lettering in many formats, so they seem convinced there
    is a digital font, but I have not found this exact style anywhere. Perhaps someone
    has designed a digital version that they sell only to stationers, but I find that
    idea hard to accept.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.haroldsfonts.com/frontpage.html\">Harold
    Lohner's Vine Monograms</a> is the most similar font I am aware of.\r\n\r\n- Mike
