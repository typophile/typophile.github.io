  a few good books but I'm not so sure about what pens to get. Can anybody suggest
  a good quality pen? My intended goal with learning this is to write nice letters
  (as in mail, not glyphs).\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help.\r\n\r\n-Glen"

    level?\r\nIf so, you could start with a fountain pen and maybe one of the basic
    calligraphy books like Jacki Svarin's 33 alphabets.\r\n\r\nfountain pens:\r\nhttp://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/7\r\n\r\nIf
    you are thinking of being a bit more disciplined and perhaps taking it the next
    step, take a class and use real dip nibs such as Brause or Mitchell nibs. John
    Neal Books sells all that stuff. They could recommend a good beginning set of
    tools for you."

  body: "If your aim is to simply develop a nice handwriting for everyday use, then
    a fountain/cartridge pen with a 1.5 or 2 millimetre wide flat nib will be best.
    My favourite is a Parker model to which Jean Fan\xE7ois Porchez introduced me
    over a decade ago, and remarkably I've managed not to lose it in all that time.
    Unfortunately, this model is no longer made, but you can find it on eBay sometimes.\r\n\r\nAvoid
    Osmiroid pens, since the nibs are not well made and tend to gunk up. That said,
    they are the only company they made a pointed split nib fountain pen, for which
    I'm very grateful; on the whole, though, they are too much trouble for an everyday
    pen."

    a holder for the nibs, such as a Caran d'Ache brand. For \"letter\" writing, you
    are going to want a fairly small nib, perhaps a .75 mm - 2 mm size.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf

    want to try a pen holder:\r\n1. don\u2019t put the pen into the inkpot but rather
    put some ink with a small brush onto the nib. this helps avoiding ink blobs.\r\n2.
    pimp your pen with som cotton wool on the downside of the nib, so that the pen
    can hold more ink at once and instead of one or two words you can write a whole
    line without refilling.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pencotton_5397.jpg]\r\nthe
    cotton can be fixed with some wire or a rubber band (rather loose than tight)"

  body: "I have practised and taught calligraphy, on and off, for some years and at
    the beginning of any course of instruction I always asked if any of the students
    were left-handed. As I asked this, my fingers were usually crossed behind my back,
    hoping that no one said yes.\r\n\r\nIt's not impossible for left handers but it
    is extremely difficult, usually made worse by the common practice that left handers
    adopt of turning the paper so that they are writing almost vertically, so's to
    avoid the hand smudging and obscuring the writing. I have seen one really extreme
    example where the paper was turned until very nearly upside down.\r\n\r\nMy dread
    of having left handers in a class was because it usually requires much, much more
    patience and discipline on the part of the student to achieve rewarding results
    and as I am next to useless with my left hand it is difficult for me to 'feel'
    the problems it creates for the student and to advise accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere
    are left-oblique nibs which can help a little but, in truth (in my experience
    anyway), it is only a little."

  body: Roundhand, split nib styles of writing can be easier for lefties. Some of
    these are actually written, by righties, used special nibs that actually mimic
    the alignment of nib to line that would be natural for a lefty. It will likely
    require a change of practice for the lefty, though, if he or she is used to turning
    the page or crooking the arm.

  body: "Hrant: <em>One big thing I wonder about is: what about leftward scripts like
    Arabic or Hebrew? Do their calligraphy teachers secretly hope for lefties in the
    class?</em>\r\n\r\nI doubt it, because although the connecting horizontal strokes
    might benefit from being written by a lefty -- the pen can be pulled rather than
    pushed -- the verticals would either need to be pushed instead or would have flipped
    terminals. Remember, when writing with a broad nib you not only get distinctive
    stroke modulation you also get distinctive stroke terminals, in terms of both
    their weight and angle.\r\n\r\nNow, if a lefty were to hold the pen in the mirror
    of how a Devanagari scribe would, i.e. with a strong rotation past the vertical,
    and modify the normal ductus of the letters accordingly, he or she might produce
    the classical styles quite well."

    want to know what pen is the best all-around pen, no one really has the answer
    for that. Buy one or a couple and see what you like. I like vintage nibs that
    can be purchased from <a href=\"http://www.pendemonium.com/\">Pendemonium</a>
    or eBay. Which one depends on what I'm doing, but the nibs are usually cheap,
    so buy a bunch and try them out.\r\n\r\nI used to think I could find the \"perfect\"
    pen, and the \"perfect\" ink, and was always dissatisfied. Finally I just bought
    a bunch of both and figured out what I like, and what works better for one thing
    or another."
