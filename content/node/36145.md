  body: "I'm not 100%, but this might have been done freehanded. The S and C have
    some really wobbly looking curves and the B is constructed rather weirdly (usually
    the top portion is slightly smaller than the bottom.) \r\n\r\nThe K is the answer,
    find a font with that K and you'll probably have what you're looking for."

    to create.

    the font may have been hand minipulated, however its all over this bands website.
    It is set in almost the whol alphabet."

  body: "It might be a custom job specifically for the Black Keys. It's also the font
    used on their new album <a href=\"http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/B000GPIPD8.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V60563569_.jpg\">\"Magic
    Potion\"</a>.\r\n\r\nI just found the website's designer. I sent him a message,
    hopefully he'll be able to respond with a definite answer. (his site: http://takes.us/)"

  body: "Well, I didn't get much help from the web designer,\r\n\r\n\"I believe it
    is called Stillness. Pat's brother, Mike, designed the album cover and chose the
    face so I am not sure where he got it from. But check out Adobe and Veer - might
    be from one of those.\"\r\n\r\nI can't find anything called Stillness.\r\n\r\nThe
    original cover art was done by Mike Carney who happens to be the drummer's brother.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome, but I didn't actually find the font. Unless someone actually
    knows a font called Stillness. I've checked around and there doesn't seem to be
    a font called Stillness, or even one close to that name.\r\n\r\nIt's still a mystery."

  body: "Well the best I can do is make a recommendation for next best solutions:\r\n\r\nCheck
    www.t26.com more specifically fonts designed by Identikal (like Distilla). I think
    you'll find a font or 2 that are close. Also, http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/burin-sans/
    is nice and light and though the K, S and E are off it's still pretty close."
