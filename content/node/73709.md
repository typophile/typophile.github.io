  the 50s. I\u2019m not asking for an ID since this is obviously custom made. But
  maybe someone knows something about this kind of wonky style or of similar looking
  typefaces. Any input is appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/boucherie_4255.jpg]"

  body: "If ever there were an argument for the use of hand-rendering over typesetting,
    that would be it. It's lovely - you must be terribly jealous! It actually reminds
    me of med 20th century American design; in fact, the \"B\" recalls the \"R\" from
    the Reese's logo, the second \"e\" resembles the Coca-Cola ribbon, and the looseness
    reminds me of 40s \"speedway\" type similar to Leslie Cabarga's Streamline.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as similar stuff goes, I'm certainly no expert on scripts, but Schizotype's
    release of last year, Astroboy, has an idiosyncratic, loopy air about it. Whether
    it's of any use to you, Jan, is another question!\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/astroboy/\r\n\r\n-NJ"
