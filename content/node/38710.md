body: "I've got a confession to make. A few days ago, I used Papyrus. I think it was
  the first time, and I've felt an inner turmoil ever since.\r\n\r\nPlease allow me
  to present the context. My kids needed to set a quick Halloween poem to give to
  a friend. I had all of 3 minutes to produce this thing, so I scanned through my
  font menu, and after trying a few other defaults that didn't feel spooky enough,
  I settled on Papyrus. Who was going to know? Problem was, the client (Isaac and
  Naomi, ages 6 and 4) loved it. \r\n\r\nAs a parent, I let my children down. Hopefully
  this won't be the pivotal experience that leads them down a pathway of Hobo and
  Comic Sans for the rest of their days. As a member (note convenient omission of
  \"founder\" here) of Typophile, I've let all of you down and disappointed myself
  as well.\r\n\r\nIs there redemption for a font sin? Will it be possible to regain
  my inner peace? Is there some sort of penance I could do, perhaps buy an H&FJ font
  family or something?\r\n\r\nI humbly await your judgement.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I feel your pain! I nearly cried when after spending weeks with constant changes
    on a newsletter, the client started insisting I set it all in Comic Sans *shudder*
    Luckily we talked them out of it :)
