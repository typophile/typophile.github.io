    doesn't meet the stem might be interesting.

    quite pleasant. I'd open up some of the counters more...on the P, R, lower counter
    of S, the eye of the e, the leftward opening on the 2, and see how that looks.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, 5 isn't working with the dip on the crossbar. P and R could be a bit wider.
    Would it destroy the harmony of the characters if the C and c were to have more
    curvy bottom halves? I like the squareness but perhaps there's not enough interplay
    of different shapes?\r\n\r\nJust some suggestions, see what you think... :)"

  body: "Hello sasapetrova,\r\n\r\nLong time no see\u2026 whatever happened with Semele?
    Have you given it up or what? By chance I roamed in the Critique/Display forum
    and found your Lambo Sans  Serif and some quite controversial and interesting
    comments, hahahahahaha\u2026 Although \u2018farquart\u2019 is a bit overdoing
    it in an outspoken way, while \u2018Bendy\u2019, \u2018speter\u2019 and \u2018cerulean\u2019
    were positively helpful. I think altogether it is not such a bad idea to see an
    artwork from the \u2018devil\u2019s advocate point of view. Therefore although
    \u2018farquart\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to have posted anything for critique and
    all the comments he has posted occasionally are mostly rather caustic and pointed,
    you should take seriously his point of view and improve as much as you can Lambo\u2019s
    design concept in order to make it better and more original.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind
    though that if you go to www.identifont.com and looks for similarities between
    typefaces, for example Eurostile (Lambo does bear a resemblance to Eurostile by
    the way) you will find quite a number of typefaces that are Eurostilistic.\r\n\r\nAll
    in all, I believe that you should take all the comments posted so far and especially
    \u2018farquart\u2019s\u2019 \r\n\r\nIn order not to add to your possible confusion
    about what to do to improve Lambo, I will post some suggestions and critique at
    a later time.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Farquart, I think it would be more constructive to explain what you don't
    like about this font, or give examples of fonts that are similar so the designer
    can make deliberate choices how to make it different or even perhaps better. The
    original question was how to make this more original or interesting.\r\n\r\nIf
    you think it's a waste of time you don't have to comment. I think it's great to
    see a whole mix of different styles on this Crit forum, from people who've only
    just got interested in type to professional type designers. The point is that
    we all want to learn from each other.\r\n\r\nNatasa, I can see from the pdf that
    you are technically capable of doing more with this. I think there are similar
    styles out there but the fact that you think it needs more 'originality' shows
    you could choose many directions to take. I'd see this as more a starting point
    than a finishing point, which means there actually is more potential! Have a play
    with different elements. I'm thinking the pattern of straight stems could be broken
    a bit. How would it look with the hmn curving inwards on the right leg? Also,
    what would happen if you bumped out the sidebearings lots?"

  body: "Great to see you back Natasha, whatever happened to Semele? I keep wondering
    about it. Reading all the comments and suggestions posted so far about Lambo,
    I realize that you must be quite mixed-up, so I thought that I might add a few
    thoughts of my own.\r\n\r\nI agree with all that was written so far especially
    with the harsh views of farquart who obviously would never make a career in the
    diplomatic corps... I have never seen any typeface designed by him in Typophile
    but that shouldn\u2019t exclude him form airing his, I believe quite honestly
    thought about, critiques so adamantly with his characteristic (I have read all
    his blog entries posted so far) touch of malice... I don\u2019t know really, he
    may be just a font freak and yet despite that, what he points out: typeface originality
    and concept, is absolutely important and totally valid.\r\n\r\nSo, I ask you \u201CWhat
    is your concept for Lambo?\u201D And please do reply, as  I believe that your
    original idea was not just another Eurostile-BankGothic-ish remake, (and yet Lambo
    does look like that) because in that case we should really take farquart very
    seriously. At this point, state clearly the Lambo concept please.\r\nI will send
    you asap some of my own suggestions.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I normally don't spend much time in the critique section. I know speter so
    I'm usually drawn to threads he comments on. To be honest I downloaded the PDF
    with the intent of marking it up with comments to help you, but I unfortunately
    have to agree with the disagreeable farquart and say the design is quite a mess.
    \r\n\r\nFirst of all squarish sans have run their course. The weight is too light
    for small sizes and too heavy to be a display lightline. \r\n\r\nThe proportions
    are very unappealing, both the lowercase and uppercase s is unbalanced. The transitions
    from the diagonal strokes to those rounded details of the A, V, W are very poorly
    drawn. \r\n\r\nThat lowercase e has got to go, it draws too much attention to
    itself. The lowercase round forms are too narrow against the square ones, but
    the Uppercase round forms are too wide against the square forms. \r\n\r\nThe r
    is too wide those details on the lowercase h, m and n that flatten the stroke
    as it emerges from the stem are completely out of character and should be rethought.
    Those completely flat terminals on the bottom of the c e and s are not helping
    at all.\r\n\r\nThe uppercase R is completely out of character with that art nouveau
    diagonal stroke. The tail of the Q is too wimpy.\r\n\r\nThat five has got to go,
    as do all the numbers. If you have to included a tabular set of figures you should
    rethink your approach since all of your figures are unbalanced. The zero looks
    too narrow as well.\r\n\r\nJust a few thoughts. Seriously, my advice  would be
    to take whatever you have learned in bringing the design to this point, and start
    over with a more carefully thought out design.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the spacing in your
    text sample too tight and the word space too loose.\r\n\r\nHey but what do I know.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "So James, like you say squarish sans have run their course, maybe yes maybe
    not, I still see quite a number of squarish sans appearing in most digital libraries
    and no one complains about it. Nevertheless, according to you which are the types
    of sans serif typefaces that have not run their course? Kindly be as specific
    as can be.\r\nStarting with the design of a light weight and then going on to
    design the heavier or even lighter weights is not such an atypical phase of typeface
    production. \r\n\r\nWhat the infamous farquart said laconically and later on quite
    nastily (even if he seems to be right), was furthered by you in a very analytical
    way but at the same time dismissing totally any merit that the typeface would
    have attained if all of us here contributed positively our ideas and suggestions
    about how this typeface could be corrected, fine tuned and redesigned to get to
    be more wholesome. \r\n\r\nThe proportions are very unappealing is an overstatement
    because you don\u2019t support your view in any way. Of course both the lowercase
    and uppercase s is unbalanced, but this is something that could fixed quite easily.
    No big deal. The transitions from the diagonal strokes to those rounded details
    of the A, V, W are indeed very poorly drawn plus M and N and also v, w, and y
    should be a little more fine tuned.\r\n\r\nHere, we are supposed to be either
    typeface design experts or font freaks and all shades in between, a typical down
    to earth graphic designer might appreciate and use a typeface (even this one at
    its present state of development) quite differently than us.\r\nThat lowercase
    e has could stay as it and maybe fine tuned some more and then its design concept
    could be used in some other characters, in that case it wont draw too much attention
    to itself and instead it could become the basis of a unique style. \r\nYes, the
    lowercase round forms are too narrow against the square ones (although everything
    is squared and rounded at the same time) and the uppercase round forms are too
    wide against the square forms. This is something that can be fixed. \r\nI believe
    that sasapetrova was designing up to now serif typefaces like the Semele that
    she had posted in the Critique-Serif forum\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/48721\r\n\r\nand
    which was quite nice according to most of the people who saw it there. Lambo is
    her first attempt in designing a sans serif display typeface and naturally she
    is off the mark in quite a number of points.\r\nSure, the r is should be more
    narrow. On the other hand, the assumption that the details on the lowercase h,
    m, n and u that flatten the stroke as it emerges from the stem are completely
    out of character and should be rethought seems to be a slightly valid point of
    view but not necessarily if this concept is also applied to all other structurally
    related letter forms. Personally, I find those completely flat terminals on the
    bottom of the c e and s quite welcome to my aesthetics provided that they conform
    harmonically with the overall design concept of the typeface.\r\n\r\nNaturally,
    it is quite obvious that the spacing in the text sample is indeed too tight and
    the word space too loose, something which is quite easily fixed.\r\n\r\nYou say:
    \u201Cthat five has got to go, as do all the numbers\u201D, there is another way
    of dealing with this: 4 and 0 must become wider, 5 must become narrower and number
    2 at the top is not designed well at all and should be fixed. That should do it.
    \r\n\r\nTheoretically, I do agree in general terms with your advice that sasapetrova
    takes whatever she has learned in bringing the design to this point, and to start
    over with a more carefully thought out design. But it would be better if she learns
    finer sans serif design aesthetics from her numerous oversights by fixing them
    all one after the other.\r\n\r\n"
