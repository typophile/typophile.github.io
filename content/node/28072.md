  indicates :)  They're wrong 99.9 percent of the time ... unlike the experts here
  who nail every request.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to get 'WhatTheFont' to read any of
  Sabrina's letters.\r\n\r\nYour help will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest wishes, Linda"

  body: "Yeah, the WKSD is Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\nWhatthefont has NO idea what to do with
    script. It also bugs me that a lowercase i reads as two characters. However I've
    had a better success rate than you have. Identifont is the one that is truly useless.\r\n\r\nSabrina
    looks like Palace Script.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=palace+script&q=Go"

  body: "The 'r' doesn't match Shelley - I tried that.\r\n\r\nI've had a few successes
    with Identifont but more often than not it gives me a blackletter when I specifically
    said it's a sans. What that site is missing, IMHO, is a first step that allows
    you to categorize the font - i.e. serif, sans, script, calligraphic, display.
    It is improved in that now you can enter the letter selection you have available
    rather than having to click 'Not Sure' on all the Q and J questions."
