    the others for when you may need them for whatever reason. It's probably better

  body: "<a>From [[http://www.linotype.com/1537/Times-family.html|Linotype's web site]]:</a>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In
    1931, The Times of London commissioned a new text type design from Stanley Morison
    and the Monotype Corporation, after Morison had written an article criticizing
    The Times for being badly printed and typographically behind the times. The new
    design was supervised by Stanley Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist
    from the advertising department of The Times. Morison used an older typeface,
    Plantin, as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy
    of space (always important concerns for newspapers). As the old type used by the
    newspaper had been called Times Old Roman,\" Morison's revision became \"Times
    New Roman.\" The Times of London debuted the new typeface in October 1932, and
    after one year the design was released for commercial sale. The Linotype version,
    called simply \"Times,\" was optimized for line-casting technology, though the
    differences in the basic design are subtle. The typeface was very successful for
    the Times of London, which used a higher grade of newsprint than most newspapers.
    The better, whiter paper enhanced the new typeface's high degree of contrast and
    sharp serifs, and created a sparkling, modern look. In 1972, Walter Tracy designed
    Times Europa for The Times of London. This was a sturdier version, and it was
    needed to hold up to the newest demands of newspaper printing: faster presses
    and cheaper paper. In the United States, the Times font family has enjoyed popularity
    as a magazine and book type since the 1940s. Times continues to be very popular
    around the world because of its versatility and readability. And because it is
    a standard font on most computers and digital printers, it has become universally
    familiar as the office workhorse. Times\u2122, Times\u2122 Europa, and Times New
    Roman\u2122 are sure bets for proposals, annual reports, office correspondence,
    magazines, and newspapers.\r\n\r\nLinotype offers many versions of this font:\r\n<strong>Times\u2122</strong>
    is the universal version of Times, used formerly as the matrices for the Linotype
    hot metal line-casting machines. The basic four weights of roman, italic, bold
    and bold italic are standard fonts on most printers. There are also small caps,
    Old style Figures, phonetic characters, and Central European characters.\r\n<strong>Times\u2122
    Ten</strong> is the version specially designed for smaller text (12 point and
    below); its characters are wider and the hairlines are a little stronger. Times
    Ten has many weights for Latin typography, as well as several weights for Central
    European, Cyrillic, and Greek typesetting.\r\n<strong>Times\u2122 Eighteen</strong>
    is the headline version, ideal for point sizes of 18 and larger. The characters
    are subtly condensed and the hairlines are finer.\r\n<strong>Times\u2122 Europa</strong>
    is the Walter Tracy re-design of 1972, its sturdier characters and open counterspaces
    maintain readability in rougher printing conditions.\r\n<strong>Times New Roman\u2122</strong>
    is the historic font version first drawn by Victor Lardent and Stanley Morison
    for the Monotype hot metal caster.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou have not specified
    the origin for the versions you have, which would be key to identifying whether
    they are commercial retail versions or OEM operating system versions."

  body: "One difference - I'm not saying it's significant - that lets people quickly
    identify whether a font is based on Linotype Times Roman or Monotype Times (New)
    Roman - is the shape of the lowercase z in italics. The Monotype version has a
    simple sloped z; the Linotype version has a swash on the bottom stroke.\r\n\r\nAny
    other differences (Linotype vs. Monotype, as opposed to Times versus Times Ten)
    are generally too subtle for the layperson and not particularly significant. Times
    Ten, on the other hand, is based on the 10 point size of Times, and so genuinely
    addresses a common flaw in digital adaptations of metal type - they're used to
    set text, but they're based on large sizes of the metal face, not text sizes,
    because they're easier to trace from.\r\n\r\nThe history is that Monotype invented
    Times Roman; Linotype licensed it, and copied it just about as closely as they
    could, and then Monotype had to use a slightly different name in the U.S. to avoid
    a trademark conflict.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, I almost forgot - and Linotype machines
    had a very serious limitation, in that the regular and italic forms (and usually
    the bold as well) of a face had to have the same widths for every letter. This
    meant, for <em>many</em> Linotype typefaces, that the italic was wider than it
    should be."

    Apparently larger metal types of TNR were digitized rather than the appropriate
    10pt. Tracing is the process of digitizing metal letters or sketches.

    draw it, the bold face was an afterthought, and someone <em>else</em> drew that
    - and thus, even then, at the time of the original hot metal introduction of Times
    Roman by Monotype (the one called Times New Roman in the U.S. for trademark reasons)
    the mismatch between the bold and the normal typeface was highly criticized.\r\n\r\nTimes

    Burgess was the real designer of Times Roman was a joke.\r\n\r\nIf so, I don't
    think that Monotype is laughing.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is the case. I think
    that Burgess did design a face, and it did look a lot like Times Roman, and so
    Mike Parker acted in good faith.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think he was still <em>wrong</em>.\r\n\r\nBasically,
    I think the original face by Burgess derived from De Vinne, while Times Roman
    derived from Plantin, and the similarity between them was coincidental (to the
    extent that it exceeded the similarity to be expected from having Caslon and Dutch
    types among their models and influences).\r\n\r\n@riccard0:\r\nActually, this
    doesn't have anything much to do with the difference between \"typeface\" and
    \"font\" in the usual sense, but rather with the difference between \"typeface\"
    and something else, which is sometimes taken as another meaning of the word \"font\".\r\n\r\nThat
    is, the thing we want people to use the word \"font\" for is one of the following:\r\n-
    a package of lead type slugs for printing in a given typeface, perhaps containing
    20 a's and proportional numbers of the rest of the letters in the alphabet;\r\n-
    a file with the extension .ttf or .otf used to allow a computer to print in a
    given typeface;\r\n- an element for a Selectric composer, the brass matrices to
    fill a Monotype matrix-case, or the round or square negative to put in a photocomposition
    machine.\r\n\r\nThe alternate meaning of font, for which we really need a <em>third</em>
    word, is a specific weight, size, and drawing of a given typeface. It's the \"sometimes
    subtle difference between <em>typeface</em> and\" <em>that</em> which Times Roman
    in this discussion would help to explain.\r\n\r\nAnd it doesn't help that this
    third thing is much closer to being like a typeface (as it is an abstract way
    of shaping letters too, just a more specific one) than it is to be a font. So
    as long as you call the third thing a font, you end up increasing confusion rather
    than decreasing it."
