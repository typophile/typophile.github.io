  body: "Dane Cook has some funny bits, but overall the guy is overrated as a comedian.
    I think he's only popular for his good looks and jock a-hole / wannabe rock-star
    persona. And the \"Tourgasm\" series on HBO really isn't very funny at all; it's
    just another boring \"reality TV\" show. Comics like Jim Gaffigan and Louis C.K.
    have much better material and seem far more talented.\r\n\r\nAs for the type on
    the poster, I'm not sure if it's custom type or what. It seems a bit derivative
    of Metallica's pointy logo."

  body: "I really like Dane. Maybe it's b/c we both hail from New England and his
    hint of an accent appeals to me. Anyway, some of his bits seriously kill me. Look
    for \"Cool Ade Man\". So funny.\r\n\r\nGaffigan is great too, I heard a bit he
    did a long time ago about the Sea Cow that was positively side splitting.\r\n\r\nAnycrap.
    My love for Dane aside. The graphics for Tourgasm are, IMHO, truly awful. \r\n\r\nSaw
    Dane's name and I had to chime in. \r\n\r\nBL"
