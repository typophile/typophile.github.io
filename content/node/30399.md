  body: "looks a lot like <a href=http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=97&dw=1241>Labelo
    Rom</a> but more compressed - \"squooshed,\" if you will. \r\n\r\ni bet the fat
    type is just outlined with a progressively thicker stroke."

  body: Yeah, it's probably just a typeface outlined and fattened up. Here's a photo
    of the typeface before it's been changed.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2260_4483.JPG]

  body: "hey Biff,\r\n\r\nare you still looking for this? it's very similar to <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/carbon/\">Carbon</a> as well, and both
    Carbon and Lamelo were designed by a Thai type designer Anuthin Wongsunkakon from
    <a href=\"http://behaviourgroup.com/\">Behaviour Group</a>. \r\n\r\nmaybe you
    could try contacting them?\r\n\r\ni'm curious now.\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n\r\n"

    this font is that Elektrosmog used in 'Swiss Design 2003' ?\r\n\r\nNote the 'g's\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3711_5622.JPG]"
