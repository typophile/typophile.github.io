  ~1930.\r\nI've already asked the people in Rome about this font, but they have no
  idea what it is.\r\nDoes anyone here recognize it?\r\n\r\nThanks for Your help\r\nJoerg

  body: The two closest things I have been able to find are Elzevir and French Old
    Style, both from Monotype, both right for the age of the sample. Q is not right
    in FOS (but it is in Elzevir), and J is not right in Elzevir. This could be an
    Italian cut related to these two typefaces?
