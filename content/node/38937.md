  of resources and I plan on visiting it daily. I have a question about a typeface
  that hopefully someone will be able to answer for me.\r\n\r\nI have always liked
  rounded fonts, however have been unable to find some nice free ones. Unfortunatley
  I don't have endless funds just yet to buy a lot of fonts, so does anyone have any
  advice for me to find some free licensed rounded style fonts?\r\n\r\nSecond question
  is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/dailypoetics/134930823/in/set-72057594104389710/\r\n\r\nWhat
  is the font featured in the \"modi\" logo in the above photo?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nJames"

    But don't come complaining afterwards that they only have a limited character
    set, poor spacing and don't perform very well. There <em>is</em> a reason why
    almost all proper fonts need to be paid for. Maybe read these, and come back next
    week for the issue of spacing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161\">An
