body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project which needs italics with a little
  more oomph to them, and I'm looking for something in the transitional or modern
  forms. My point of departure in this search is the new Didot Christian Schwartz
  and Paul Barnes completed for Vanity Fair. <a href=\"https://commercialtype.com/news/updates/vf_didot_for_vanity_fair\">According
  to their own blog on the commission</a>, the drawings they built their didone from
  revive a specific letterer's cuts: Mol\xE9 Le Jeune. \r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily
  convinced that Didot, specifically, is what I'm looking for (and the Vanity Fair
  revival is also really peculiar and modernized, in ways I'm not so interested in).
  But the excessive sloping\u2014the \"speed\" of these italics\u2014is very much
  what I need. And I like this \"voice\" of rational, modern forms (and of the 'more'
  rational forms from the transitionals like Baskervilles and Bookmans\u2014the Zapf
  International would probably fit this bill, but I'm not wild on its digitization,
  and the itals are still not anywhere as far forward as the VF Didot). \r\n\r\nAre
  there any suggestions out there about commercial releases you know of that fit this
  basic Modern/Transitional categorization, which seem perhaps more \"eager\" in their
  forward lean, than a typical italic in the genres? I looked at a few things, from
  Hoefler&Co's Surveyor to James Montalbano's Consul (both of which I love, but I'm
  not sure are quite leaning forward as much as I wish they would), but I'm not convinced
  yet that I've found anything really compelling. I am sure, however, that my knowledge
  of foundries is limiting me greatly and hoping a crowdsourcing here might prove
  useful to me and others looking for such. \r\n\r\nHelp much appreciated & many thanks
  in advance."
