  to find out what font the \"2 peas\" part is. I know it has been around for at least
  45 years. My dad has a clay sculpture he made with this exact font pressed into
  it. The star is part of the font and the other numbers are swirly too. This is the
  only sample I could find. I think it is also a popular font for things in art museum
  gift shops."
