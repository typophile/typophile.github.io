body: "I've been eyeing this typeface for a while now but haven't been able to pin
  down exactly what it is. Anyone have any ideas? It's very  similar to Lubalin, Clarendon,
  Rockwell and Serifa but not quite. Is it Ink Gothic or Joshua Darden's \"Untitled\"
  typeface? I can't figure it out. I'd appreciate any help. Thanks.\r\n\r\nClick [[http://www.amctv.com|here]]
  to see this typeface in use for all their headlines. They also use an italicized
  version in their on-screen graphics."
