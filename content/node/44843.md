  where we have to design a poster that encapsulates the nature and personality of
  the typeface. I've chosen Frederic Goudy's Hadriano. I'm looking for a photograph
  of the original stone tablet he took a rubbing from in the Louve for inspiration.
  Does anyone have any idea where I could find this? Better yet, a photo of the tablet
  in question? It would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\nSarah"
