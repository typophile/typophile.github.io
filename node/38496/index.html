  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all!

I'm thinking in read some books about typography.
I already buy the "The Elements of Typographic Style".
But in a search I found this 2 books that look very complet. But since you guys are "the pros", I dn't want to spend my few euros in weak books...
So, are this books about type good?

Grid Systems: Principles of Organizing Type by Kimberly Elam
Exploring Typography by Tova Rabinowitz

Or better books?
I want to (start?) develop my learnings the wonderfull world of typography

		<div class="commentbody">Elam’s book on grid systems is excellent, but not worth much on it’s own as it explores how objects function within grids without really explaining the geometry that goes into really building good grids in the first place. The Rabinowitz book is a textbook in a traditional sense. It is a long survey of typography covering everything from font history to page layout to font design. All of the text is very dumbed-down, but I find that to be the strong point of the book, because it has none of the excesses and pretense that clutter up most of the books in this category, particularly those easily purchased in the United States. The downside is that, being a mass-market textbook, the design is just plain ugly and a segue of some sort is randomly assorted into every chapter. It also wastes a tremendous amount of space on specimens of the same common typefaces that get shown in one typography book after another. 

The two books would actually make a pretty good pair. </div>

It is my one exception (do you always have to have one exception?) to my general rule of never buying a book whose title includes any of the following words:
<ol><li>complete</li>
<li>ultimate</li>

<li>idiot's</li>
<li>moron</li>

		<div class="commentbody">Logo Font & Lettering Bible: A Comprehensive Guide to
the Design, Construction and Usage of Alphabets and Symbols

by Leslie Cabarga
 

I just got this book in on Friday, and have read over half of it so far, and find it a great resource, probably on a par with Bringhurst. It is not as much logo as lettering, and font design is included in the latter. </div>
