How many hours does it take to design a standard font? On average?

Let's say caps and lower case and numerals, standard punctuation and accents - the same as you would get in a 256 postscript font. Spaced kerned and basic hinting. Format can be OpenType but not with all the crazy ligatures, alt. characters and obscure accents.

Did erik spiekermann once quote 120 hours?

There are too many variables involved to give a meaningful ballpark estimate. I've seen posts in this forum stating that upwards of eight hundred hours were involved with the creation of one font. On the other hand, I have managed to knock out a few with complete Latin 1252 and CE 1250 character sets in less than twelve hours each, including hand-kerning each and every possible letter combination. It all depends: Tata Nano or Maybach?</div>

That is correct. 

So when discussing the time required to get from the beginning to abandonment, I think the variables are the designer(s), the tool(s), the specification, the design characteristics, client temperature and the distance of all but the last variable to food, water and relief of various kinds.

Yes, unlike a poem -or other artwork- which is basically self-expression. So we could equate the user with Society, which gives us a better option that "abandoned": something like "sent off into the world", as one does with his child - and I think this is how Sumner Stone has described the act of releasing a font. This is especially fitting since even after release some users will contact the designer for some form of help with the font!  :-)

		<div class="commentbody">“A font is never finished, only published.” - I wholly agree, and I really like Hrants notion. But it is also totally terrible to go back to your fonts (children) born some two or three years back: you want to change just about everything.

I made a font with full MacOS Roman character set in 3 hours and 4 minutes in Font Marathon. That was in ATypI Helsinki 2005. End result was pretty much crap, but it is a working OpenType sans serif. I believe that is the world record.

Usually, If I have a decent idea, sans serif takes a day, and serif takes two with kerning. If I get doubts on the way, it obviously takes longer. After that it slows down: small caps, alternatives, italics. And then the weights, if it  turns out to be a family or a super family.</div>

When you work in iterations every design challenge can be solved in every time frame. The different results are distinguished by different level of perfection. I can write a complete alphabet in under one minute. If you give me one hour to draw the same alphabet it will still be a complete alphabet but more time has gone into the design of every individual glyph. I think that in an ideal situation you should be able to stop at every point in time and always have a completed job. The question is what degree of perfection is actually required by the purpose for which you are drawing the font. When do you stop refining and start with the next project? I say, release early and often. But then again, I always fail keeping to these maxims.

I don't believe that Julian is correct in his definition of the work entailed as "design":

<em>...caps and lower case and numerals, standard punctuation and accents - the same as you would get in a 256 postscript font. Spaced kerned and basic hinting. Format can be OpenType but not with all the crazy ligatures, alt. characters and obscure accents.</em>

Once <strong>Hamburgefonts</strong> is completed, the font is designed, and the rest is execution/manufacture.
This much we know from a thread earlier this year, which revealed the collaborative nature of much font-making.

I think not only drawing the complete glyph set and font metrics are part of the design process, but even the thought that goes into deciding about OTF features is also relevant. Probably actual coding may be considered "production" but the word "manufacture" seems a wrong choice. To me, manufacture is the physical building of some durable goods where the pieces are duplicated and then reconfigured into an exact copy of the "designed" product. With fonts, to me, this means just testing, correcting, duplicating files, and uploading.</div>

Let's keep the algorithms at bay for as long as we can.

It is the global automations, applied to every glyph in a font, which are most problematic.
Of course, it is possible to tweak individual glyphs once they have been algorithmically modified.
But over-reliance on automations depreciates the taste and skill required to make such manual adjustments well.</div>

But, type designers were annoyed how long it took to make these typefaces, so God gave man tools and technology.

Now, the world is bursting with too many fonts.

So, God created the OpenType format and allowed extended character sets and a lot more stuff in a font.

Where then do you draw the line between design and execution?
</cite>

Maybe design is execution... and vice versa.

You can have a clear idea of your typographic design (be it in your mind or in paper) but one you star drawing your glyphs and the font begins to come to like, you start noticing all those little details that makes the difference.
You  start noticing that some glyphs will need to be wider, some other narrower, and you start redefining the relations of the drawing of the glyphs and the spacing, the side-bearings, maybe you refine some terminals, some angles, the strokes weights, and all that stuff.

So, in the same way that the letter-forms relate to the spacing, and the spacing relate to kerning... I will say that design is also related to execution, and the line is not clearly defined.

Also, I believe that good execution is a little harder to achieve, since it requires a lot of technical knowledge, and ultimately will depend on practice and expertise on the tools used. While design can come natural to some people, while other will also achieve it by learning and practice.

As an example, the people at CheapProFonts are doing something like that.
Working with free fonts authors that provide some good designs but laking the execution skills, and improving on the execution side: by tweaking the design to improve it, refining contours, adding diatrics, OT features, and all the tech aspects.

I'm sure that in time they will figure out a way to automate type design, and we will all be out of a job.

A machine will just be turning out variations until eternity.

Automation is just a tool, use it wisely.

I still believe that we should be involved with the entire job of type design.

The aesthetic as well as the technical aspects.

Yes, I too get frustrated with the endless tweaks and modifications necessary in good type design.

And I get bored, usually about halfway, and I would easily like to give the technical aspect and other stuff to others to do.

And just spend time thinking up new ideas and such. Who wouldn't?

But, if we relocate that work to others, who will control the final product.

I think it's important to be involved in the entire process. No shortcuts.

No matter how long it takes!

		<div class="commentbody">@Pablo: <em>I will say that design is also related to execution, and the line is not clearly defined.</em>

The refinements you describe are "crafting" and are part of execution.

There is a certain amount of authorship in crafting and font production in general, but it is not design.

Of course, there can be feedback from crafting that necessitates design changes.

"Design" has a broad variety of meanings (rather like those other typographic bugbears "modern" and "style"), but I do think there should be some terminological distinction between inventing a typeface and producing it.

If not, we have the bizarre situation where someone who produces a digital revival of a face can be credited as the co-designer. Conveniently, the original designer may no longer be around to question the appropriation.

Here's what happened to me: I never contested the digital rights to my first sans, Shinn Sans, which were acquired and digitized by Steve Jackaman (Red Rooster), and he credited himself as co-designer. I had originally created three weights of Roman. Steve interpolated two more, and made slanted italics. He also did a considerable amount of adaptation of my original pen-and-ink artwork, which had all kinds of ticks and ink traps (it had been drawn for Diatronic photocomposition), as well as creating the metrics and kerning. However, I requested that he change the attribution, and he was gracious enough to do so, and is now credited with "digitally engineered". That was my suggestion at the time (2002) although today I would probably prefer "digitally crafted".

It's a very fancy "wedding-type" script font.

I find script typefaces very challenging to do.

Not really my forte, but I have always aspired to try my hand at one.

This one has many alternates, beginnings and ending variations.

A work of love and agony. I go back to it every once in a while.

Like "Michelangelo" said to "Pope Julius II", the Sistine Chapel fresco will be done when I am done.

My sentiments exactly. Patience is a virtue.

Princeton University defines <strong>iteration</strong> as a single execution of a set of instructions that are to be repeated. If one defines the "set" of instructions as "sweep", the process is iterative. In any case, quibbling over semantics does nothing to improve your approach to design.</div>
