body: I have been customizing my resume and happened upon the wonderful world of specialized
  fonts. What are your thoughts on using Whitney in the body of a resume? I plan on
  using Mercury in the headings. H&FJ recommend mixing the two and I am thinking about
  doing the same for my resume. Thank you in advance for your thoughts.
