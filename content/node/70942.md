body: "I am working on a monogram style logo for a musician, and would like some comments
  to help me refine the lockup.  The musician plays trumpet and also some other instruments,
  and is classically trained.  He performs and teaches in classical and jazz improvisation
  styles.  I wanted the mark to capture the elegance and sophistication of the music,
  and also fit in with something like a University setting.  I am happy with the concept
  but the typography seems to be where I am having the most questions, but feel free
  to comment on any of it.  Here is where I am with it so far:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimJames3_5144.png]"

  body: Clever idea. I think the left part of T should be closer to symmetrical with
    the right in weight and shape.

  body: I would begin with visually equalizing the height of Timothy and James. (A
    side effect would be, that you could give James a bit more letter spacing, although
    I am not sure, if more letter spacing is needed in case of that logo.) And then
    I would think about, if two typefaces are necessary.

  body: "Thanks for the comments!  I did have the T symmetrical, but I started to
    look for something in the negative space on the left.  Maybe that's just me.  I
    will play around with making it more similar but slightly different.  I thought
    maybe the note is not obvious enough, and having the odd T helps you see the note.
    \ But then again, I kind of like how the note is not obvious at first, but easily
    seen after looking.  I wonder how obvious it needs to be and how quickly others
    see it.  Or did others miss it entirely?\r\n\r\nI am wondering if Bodoni would
    work for everything or if anyone has any other suggestions.  I kind of wanted
    to bring is a juxtaposition or slight contrast between the type faces to suggest
    more variety to the music (from classical orchestra to pub jazz), and bring in
    a slight institutional (University) feel with the sans-serif, but maybe thats
    not working.  I thought it would play off of the different letter shapes in the
    mark too.  I was trying to match the weight of the heavy lines in the sans and
    serif fonts, but matching letter height is a good idea.  I wanted to slightly
    emphasize the last name since that is often the defining identity in this profession
    (think <em>prof. _____ </em>or <em>composed by ____ </em>).  But I do think matching
    the letter height is a good direction.  I will also play around with a single
    font to see if I can find something that works a little better.  Maybe I was too
    worried about the space between the lines of text with a lowercase last name.
    \ \r\n\r\nThanks again for all the help!  It really gives me a lot to think about.\r\n\r\np.s.
    how do you embed the image instead of just link or attach?"

  body: "The thin cuts don\u2019t work there, because they are slayed by the bold
    ones. And in example A JAMES looks still slightly higher than Timothy. From the
    three examples C looks the best, but I would try a heavier weight. And while the
    sans serif, that you used, did not necessarily need a bit more spacing, the serif
    does, if you set the word in capital letters only. In case of C I don\u2019t feel
    uncomfortable with the different point sizes. In example A James is already spaced
    too wide. (When I wrote about the letter spacing, I did not mean, that it is needed,
    but should be tried only.)"

    the italic thing (skew the whole thing), and I am not convinced.  It could be

    think non-designers think that way. There needs to be some sort of refinement,

  body: "@frode frank: The note head could come level a bit more I suppose.  It was
    important to maintain authenticity in the note shape because the audience and
    client are sensitive to what often comes off as cartoonish or caricatures of music
    symbols in a lot of music related graphics.  But there is some room for rotating
    it a bit.  It does impact the curve of the J but perhaps that could be a benefit.
    \ I will try it, thanks.\r\n\r\nI can see collaborating with another designer
    as an alternative to online feedback, thats a good option.  I agree that there
    is a danger of design by committee via message board.  But I feel this thread
    has been productive, and I am happy with how the mark has progressed as a result
    of some of the feedback I have received.  That's reason enough for me!\r\n\r\n@evanbrog:
    I think I see what you mean.  I will play around with that.  The J in the original
    font is very narrow with a tiny hook, and so I modified it as well as some of
    the other letters (A and T especially).  I was trying for a J a bit like Frutiger
    black but with a taper to match the weight variation of the other letters.  But
    I can see trying some other options, thanks for the visual!"

    is the central concept of this design.  I would be hard pressed to claim that
