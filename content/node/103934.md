body: "I found this image via an online photo archive belonging to an artist here
  in the NL. I'm no typographer but it looks like a slightly wider version of Arial
  Rounded MT, no? Particular attention towards P, L, C, M, E, and S... very rounded,
  even 'techno/space-like'. After exhausting the powers of online type queries I am
  hoping that someone here can help identify this particular face. One thing the artist
  mentioned was that it was highly possible it was a free font and dated around 2008.
  \r\n\r\nI know the text itself might be small but I think it's possible to make
  out the differences of the type.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, Typophiles! : ) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_6028.jpg]"
