  body: ' I still have to give it a second read, but I was very impressed. I am unfamiliar
    with some of the historical contexts to which you referred, but I felt that the
    topic was well handled. like I said, one more read and I may be able to offer
    some more useful comments. <BR> <BR>I can say that the translation to english
    was a bit garbled in places. the disturbance to my comprehension was only minor,
    but nonetheless present. '
