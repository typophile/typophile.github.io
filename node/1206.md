  body: It&#39;s on the tip of my tongue, too. We had this one before, and I can&#39;t
    remember for the life of me which it is, though I&#39;m pretty sure someone ID&#39;d
    it, and I recall being surprised that it wasn&#39;t a free font. Dang, isn&#39;t
    Yves at work yet?

  body: Hi guys, we&#39;re currently being busted by the BSA  <BR>who come looking
    for pirated software, so I&#39;ll be  <BR>unavailable for most of the day. No
    one is allowed  <BR>to come near his/her gear, and only this ole&#39;  <BR>crummy
    computer has been cleared up till now. It  <BR>seems your night nurse is off duty
    unfortunately.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: It&#39;s a friggin&#39; nightmare, I tell ya. Every hour more  <BR>that this
    lasts we&#39;re losing money. The clients are  <BR>waiting for their designs and
    corrected files, the  <BR>printers are waiting for their films... They only sent  <BR>in
    one single expert, and he has to check every  <BR>one of the 25&#43; computers
    himself, so we&#39;re in it for  <BR>the long haul. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/angry.gif"
