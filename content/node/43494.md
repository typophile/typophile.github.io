  over Firefox. I found Jungle in my Font Book and disabled it, but this one eludes
  me. It's not showing up in my Web Collection which is kind of weird.\r\n\r\nIdeas?"

    your font cache(s) might help. FontExplorer X can do this, it\u2019s free. Or
    Font Finagler (shareware)."

    vibe. I still haven't found that font in my font book, but FontExplorer X clearing
    the cache did the trick. \r\n\r\nThanks for the tip."
