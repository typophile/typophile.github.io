  body: i was expecting something past five minutes. <BR>i guess i should know better
    by now. it&#39;s an <BR>interesting look, but might be better used if it <BR>traded
    places with avant garde. the ad is <BR>so small i could barely read the copy.
    <BR>but that&#39;s just me. <BR> <BR>thanks bj, and thanks yves for the link.
