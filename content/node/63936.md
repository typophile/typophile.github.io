body: I am addicted to neo sans and tech today haha. Here is another concept created
  today let me know what you guys think. I used the L to make a path in the symbol.
  I really feel like the path is too rounded at the bottom left and making that less
  rounded will help the shape work. Let me know what you guys think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leadmesh3_6590.png]

    an arrow.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leadmesh4_4878.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/leadmesh5_5863.png]

  body: 'Yup. But even without it there''s nothing "leading" or "meshy" about the
    second set of marks. The first set is somewhat better as it implies following,
    but the L in the arrow is lost to the presence of a turn in the road, which implies
    sudden change of direction, which in turn carries a bunch of negative connotations. '

  body: I dont think connotations are too bad as the arrow is heading upwards.  However
    i do agree with Epsilicon that the first set is better; perhaps if you removed
    the perspective on the arrow the 'L' would be more obvious
