  body: I have that book, having picked it up on a whim when I was in London recently.
    It&#39;s real cute! It makes me want to buy and use the Shire Types pretty bad!

  body: Quite apart from the nice showings of Jeremy&#39;s types, the book is worth
    getting for Catherine Dixon&#39;s essay on the history of type specimens. I like
    very much the idea of using a type specimen book as a vehicle for such an essay,
    rather than just a marketing piece. Inspiring.

    anyone know?

  body: The link is to Tankard&#39;s site, which does not have information that I
    can see, including in the newsletter that mentions the printing of the specimen
    book.

  body: I&#39;ve also been pulling my hair out trying to get a copy. I sent an e-mail
    to Tankard&#39;s site a  little while back requesting information on where/how
    to purchase the book, but never received a response.

  body: Just got a group e-mail from Tankard saying he had been away and hadn&#39;t
    anticipated the review and the interest it stirred.  <BR> <BR>The book will be
    included with all online/direct sales and otherwise will be 7.95 pounds sterling.  <BR>
    <BR>He will e-mail a PDF orderform to those interested.
