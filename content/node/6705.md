body: Anyone know what font was used to make this logo? Also, does anyone have any
  insights as to what the red and blue bar might represent? I am doing an analysis
  on the logo for a school project and just can&#39;t seem to get anywhere with it.
  Thanks a lot! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49114.gif"
