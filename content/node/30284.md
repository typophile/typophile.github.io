  me directly</a>.\r\n\r\nAnyone else tested this page on their profile?"

  body: i believe that this has been disabled as many users were receiving spam that
    was coming though typophile. let me see if i can find the official statement...

  body: There is no indication that it is disabled on each user's contact page. It
    allows anyone to enter a message and hit "send e-mail" as if something was actually
    sent. I shudder to think how many messages I've missed over the last 2 years --
    or how many have missed mine.

  body: Yeah, not sure that's related as I wasn't using a typophile.com address in
    my profile.

    morning. Sometimes, a huge \"ACCESS DENIED\" sign would appear when I tried to
    go into a forum.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "Just received an email message that was sent on Dec. 29! Perhaps a fix is
    in?\r\n\r\nBram - That is a separate issue and from what I can tell only a temporary
    hiccup.\r\n\r\nAlso, just to clarify, the Typophile Instant Messenger (at the
    bottom of every page) works fine. It's the Contact page, accessible from any user's
    profile page, that I'm referring to."

  body: "This is somewhat off-topic, but I thought I could pop up here and make a
    small request: \r\n\r\nI keep getting an <strong>Access Denied</strong> message
    when I use my plain ol' bookmarked browser link to go to the main \"forums\" page
    of the site. I am able to go to the index page of typophile.com, and from there
    I can select one of the featured threads (which is how I got here), and my name
    is showing up in the \"new comment\" area which means I must be logged in, but
    then if I go up to the top of the page and choose \"forums\" I get the same message.\r\n\r\nI'm
    running OS10.3.9 and Firefox. Can anyone suggest to me what I should do to remedy
    this? (I'm assuming it's on my side and not the server side.) And please if anyone
    has a suggestion please email to me at bruce@brucekennettstudio.com . . . since
    I can't get to the regular menu of forums!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBruce\r\n\r\n(I
    feel as if I'm writing a message in a bottle and hurling it out into the surf!)"

    well.\r\n\r\nIf it was a hiccup in the system, I guess the best suggestion is
    to wait for a little bit."

  body: Well, it's not Firefox. I just launched Safari, and had to log in anew from
    that browser, and although I at first had the menu of forums available, once I
    went to this thread I was unable to go up to the top to select forums. I guess
    I'll just quit and listen to some music, and maybe tomorrow something will be
    different.
