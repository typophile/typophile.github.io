  href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/70983\">Reinventing the Book</a>\", I\u2019m still
  mighty curious about Amazon's font selection for its Monday-launched e-book device,
  Kindle. I mean, for starters, out of all typeface in the world, why <a href=\"http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/18/amazon-kindle-ebook.html\">Caecilia</a>?\r\n\r\n<p>However,
  I think that Amazon might have gotten it right this time, because the device was:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Birthed
  with a culturally-centered principles, and</li>\r\n<li>Built by sociologists and
  ethnographers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs quoted from the article:\r\n<blockquote>...he
  [Jeff Bezos] ticks off a number of attributes that a book-reading device...must
  have. First, it must project an aura of bookishness; it should be less of a whizzy
  gizmo than an austere vessel of culture.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this with
  <a href=\"http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/\">Sony Reader's</a>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Feature
  and benefit-centered principle, and</li>\r\n<li>Clunky reading interface that attempted
  to mirror exactly the appearance of a physical book or a PDF file (that looked like
  it was designed by a programmer instead of a sociologist). Look, dudes, with every
  new medium must come a new presentation model that is specifically suited to that
  medium, even if the contents themselves are old and dusty.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs quoted
  from their website copy:\r\n<blockquote>The Sony\xAE Reader provides a new way to
  experience reading. It boasts an impressive display, utilizing breakthrough technology
  that\u2019s almost paper-like. In addition, the text can be magnified for sight-impaired
  readers. Daylight readable, high contrast, high resolution, near 180\xBA viewing
  angle.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think that if any revolution is to take place, it has
  to take the human spirit into account. From what I\u2019ve read so far, Amazon seemed
  to do just that; but it remains to be seen whether those words were true to principle
  or just extremely empathic/clever PR.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?\r\n\r\nNote: this article
  is a repost of <a href=\"http://linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/though-i-generally-shy-away-from-any-article-that-involve-phrases-like-\u201Creinventing-the-book\u201D/\">what
  I\u2019ve written in my blog</a>, because I think that the content is relevant to
  our community."

    is one of my favorite typefaces, and very readable, so I applaud their choice,
    but it doesn't look very good in the photos of Kindle that I've seen. I hope it's
    better in person.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the type on Kindle is that paragraphs
    are full-justified and the layouts are not designed, just plain text."

  body: Unfortunately you're right, Ricardo. Seems that all these talks about staying
    true to the spirit of the physical book might only be true conceptually and not
    practically. Their intent and principle may be noble, but their design and implementation,
    not so much.

    reading on the bus/by the fire, I think you'll see paper for a LONG time to come,
    but there are definitely areas where not wasting trees and having a large access
    to a lot of texts will be useful.\r\n\r\nThat said, the whole DRM aspect of Amazon's
    product is absurd.\r\n\r\nWhich is incredibly ironic given that they've done such
    a great job with their DRM-free MP3 service."

    have to disagree, but not entirely. When I want quick, up-to-date documentation
    I don\u2019t want to mess around with an ebook, I want something like the Adobe
    help system. Sifting through a PDF or ebook is better than paper, but having it
    all cross-linked and organized hierarchically in a help app is much more efficient."

    are both useful, but both different.\r\n\r\nGranted, both should be able to co-exist
    on an eBook reader."

  body: "With all these talks, then, why would you ever want to read on an ebook device
    over a regular book? I\u2019m mighty curious, because our community is pretty
    steeped in tradition.\r\n\r\nFor me, it\u2019s a question of habit. I\u2019m used
    to reading one storybook at one time before finishing it and moving on to another
    book. Had I have a habit of reading, say, 3 novels at a time, or doing a comparative
    study of some sorts, then I might use Kindle to save some space on my bag. That\u2019s
    the only reason for using that I can think of.\r\n\r\nAgain, the question of the
    day is \u201Cwhy would you ever want to read on an ebook device over a regular
    book?\u201D I\u2019d love to know all of your opinions.\r\n\r\nI also think that
    if a multifunction device like Kindle is to succeed, it\u2019s got to offer something
    more than just <em>convenience.</em> <a href=\"http://linkenfuego.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/i-have-now-just-realized-that-the-web-development-software-coda-is-equal-to-iphone-in-spirit/\">After
    the iPod, everything also has to be <em>elegant.</em></a> And I\u2019m not just
    talking about it in the physical sense, but also in the user interaction and mental
    sense.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=BKUKQ7QqOHw\">Watching its
    instructional video</a> almost made me wish for an iPhone-like interface. Everyone
    in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39250\">lazyeye88\u2019s post</a> would
    agree, no ;^) ?"

    type with no hyphenation. I mean, is programming hyphenation THAT hard? As you
    can see in the Kindle demo video, the no-hyphenation result is some very gappy
    text.
