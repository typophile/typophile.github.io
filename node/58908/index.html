  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Not really (not yet) a typography critique request, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;only&rdquo; about the font selection/pairing: Am I crazy, or do these two really look quite happy (or at least interesting, and definitely not bad) together?</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitman-fedra-1_3862.jpg]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitman-fedra-2_4169.gif]
To my eye, they seem to click – in an interesting and not quite friction-less way. Maybe beyond the surface differences of their curves, they share some &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; character traits that make them work together – a certain tautness/springiness maybe, which of course is much more overt in Fedra (which is fine, since it&rsquo;s playing the display part here)?
But does that make any sense, or am I over-brainalyzing things? 
My eyes say it&rsquo;s good, they think, but I&rsquo;m not sure.
.
In any case, of the faces FB recommends as being &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; with Whitman, I only have a couple weights of ITC Franklin, and that looks a bit lazy/plump next to Whitman (&amp; nothing against Franklin, I&rsquo;m using it in a different book currently where it works great).
.
In any case, Kent, if I haven&rsquo;t said it before, congratulations, and thanks – Whitman is truly a thing of beauty, and already a joy to work with! :-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d think the example in this thread (if it does work) disproves this (maybe depending on your definition of &ldquo;structural characteristics&rdquo;).
It seems like a classic approach to pair faces that share a similar historical lineage, stress angle, construction principle, overall proportions, stuff like that. Seen from that angle, I actually don&rsquo;t think that Whitman and Fedra are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> much alike; but for some reason (and I can only really hint at some similar &ldquo;attitude&rdquo;, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> maybe if you think of them as humans) they still seem to relate to each other here. 
It drives me nuts, but I really can&rsquo;t pinpoint <!-- raw HTML omitted -->why<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – I think I&rsquo;ve reached the point where the way I can talk about what I&rsquo;m doing gets all touchy-feely-mystical. :-\</p>
<p>In any case, I agree with Stephen: There are so many variables that can provide the &ldquo;link&rdquo; between two typefaces, as long as the &ldquo;tone&rdquo; is right. Of course there are still pairings that don&rsquo;t work well. Many. Actually, this outlook makes it harder to combine fonts, if anything, because it&rsquo;s less about following a given recipe. (And having fewer &ldquo;hard rules&rdquo;, as safety nets, makes it harder to trust one&rsquo;s eyes – which is probably also why I posted this here.)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Anyway, yes, I felt I wanted to give Whitman some extra leading, to give its extenders some room to well, extend. :-) It feels like a generous face and I don&rsquo;t want to squeeze it onto the page. And also because the measure might end up being a bit long. 
But all that hasn&rsquo;t really been carefully figured out yet – please see this thing above as a raw sketch of sorts.</p>

<p>BTW, Ben: I hate to say this (because I <em>heart</em> Fedra too) but there really is a bit of unexpected bumpiness in the spacing. At least if you use the small caps, prepare to do some manual kerning. It&rsquo;s not bad – it&rsquo;s just not extremely, utterly perfect. ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting, what makes you say «unexpected»? They are rather cursive in structure, yes – minus things like the «g»; and they retain angularity/rigidity in detail, which keeps them from being overly soft. Actually Whitman overall has some slightly «oldstyle»/bookish details that I find quite charming, like a slanting hyphen! But it&rsquo;s not affected – it&rsquo;s genuine, and I enjoy how it brings together these details with an overall fresh and clean feel.
BTW, for the record, the large type in the headings is Whitman Display.</p>
<p>Fedra&rsquo;s spacing: Dunno – like I said, I don&rsquo;t want to make it sound worse than it is.</p>
