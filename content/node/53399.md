  body: 'Something with a vertical stress, like Century. I''ve also paired Century
    Old Style as a text face with Futura headings, and I think think it worked pretty

  body: 'Century Old Style would be good, but you should also look at more contemporary
    interpretations of the Scotch type style such as Nick Shinn''s impressive [[http://shinntype.com/|Scotch
    Modern]]. Alternatively, you could consider a Baskerville or Walbaum from either
    Berthold or Storm. '
