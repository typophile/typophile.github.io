body: "Apologies if you are all already aware of this; I wasn't until a friend alerted
  me to it today, which is why I thought I'd post it here & now. \r\n\r\nIf you feel
  you can spare a donation (of any size) for a cause dear to most typophiles' hearts,
  please visit the link below.\r\n\r\nSt Bride Library - The real story\r\nIt has
  been apparent for some time that St Bride Library's facilities in Bride Lane are
  in need of major improvement. Since the library returned to the control of the governors
  of St Bride Foundation on 1 April 2004, plans have been developed to radically improve
  the accommodation and the services offered, and those plans have now received planning
  consent.\r\nRecently there has been some publicity suggesting that the library might
  have to close ('\xA37m funds needed to save library' - BBC News 6.1.07), but the
  \xA37m sought is not simply 'To save the library' but is the cost of this major
  refurbishment of the building, including:\r\n. Building of new exhibition and reading
  rooms within the present lightwell void with a four-fold increase in the number
  of books on open access to readers.\r\n. Refurbishment of the existing reading room
  as a special collections area and return of the Blades Library to its pristine Victorian
  state as the heart of the collection.\r\n. Creation of a working demonstration area
  for the artefact collection with glass-screened viewing zone, coupled with refurbishment
  of the raked Victorian classroom adjacent to the demonstration area.\r\n. Installation
  of a passenger lift serving most levels of the building, augmented by stair lifts,
  and rationalization of the numerous floor levels to improve access for all.\r\n.
  Provision of a dedicated book lift between stacks and reading room.\r\n. Creation
  of a BS5454:2000 compliant archive storage area.\r\n. Provision of a substantial
  ground-floor cafe / bar area and an additional meeting room.\r\n. Improvements to
  the theatre area to provide a multi-use theatrical and conference facility.\r\n.
  Imposing new entrance from Bride Lane.\r\nAfter the improvements, the St Bride Foundation's
  total business model is a healthy one and the future bright; without them the library
  is expensive to run and cannot continue indefinitely.\r\nSo, the question 'Is the
  St Bride Library in danger of closing?' is not straightforward. Firstly, it is intended
  that the Library will close for the period of the building works in any event; the
  real question is 'Will it reopen afterwards?'. Exciting plans have been prepared
  to radically improve an old and quirky building, and those plans have been granted
  planning permission, with final approval given only last month. The money to carry
  out the works is now needed: application has been made to the Heritage Lottery Fund
  for half the sum required and there is a fundraising strategy in place for the remainder.\r\nFundraising
  is beginning to show results, but the pace needs to quicken so that the project
  can be assured of success. The building works are anticipated to begin in mid-2008.
  However the project still needs a considerable amount of money to be secured in
  the next few months, so that it can be assured of success. \r\n\r\nThose wishing
  to assist should contact the library at their <a href=\"http://www.stbridefoundation.org/supportus/friendsofstbride.html\">support
