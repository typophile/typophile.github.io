body: "Here's a question for you Illustrator Pros. Is there an extension/plugin that
  adds web/screen resize views to the current view sizes. \r\n\r\nIn case you're not
  following: Down in the bottom left there's a pop-up menu with resize percentages
  ...100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%... I'm curious if there's a resize that works in
  web layout sizes like 800x600 or 1024x768 where it resizes your image to that percentage
  so that I don't have to change my actual screen resolution to those sizes to get
  the idea. \r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how to search for such a feature or if it
  even exists (might be worthwhile to submit as a possible new feature for the upcoming
  releases.) \r\n\r\nAny ideas would be great. \r\n\r\n* Appreciate if you didn't
  question my choice of using Illustrator to make web graphics, I prefer to start
  there then finish up in Photoshop. Thanks*"

    I completely recommend it. I am <em>not</em> a web designer, but have designed
    for the web and found it extremely useful. '

    on top with a mask.

  body: "Miss Tiffany, I really appreciate your suggestions, actually some of those
    tools seem really cool, but it's still not quite what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nI'm
    clearly not expressing my needs right. \r\n\r\nCurrently when I work in Illustator
    my monitor is set for 1280x1024 but most of the sites I do use a relative resolution
    of 800x600. When I work on them I have to switch my monitor resolution because
    I tend to make thing too large when I leave it at my original resolution. I hate
    loosing all that real estate in the larger resolution when I switch to the smaller
    resolution, so I was wondering if there was a quick Zoom/View feature that would
    allow me to keep my larger 1280X1024 resolution and only \"zoom in\" when I want
    to check to make sure I'm not making things too large. The work around I have
    now is thru my Video Card where I have to manually change the entire screen resolution
    (which usually takes a few seconds everytime, plus I don't know how good that
    is for the video card to constantly switch back and forth between resolutions
    so frequently. \r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense.  I just want to have a nice little
    button or drop-down menu in Illustator that just Zooms my image to simulate a
    different resolution from what I'm working in. \r\n\r\nThink Developer Tools extension
    for Firefox where you can resize the browser to different resolutions without
    actually changed the screen resolution. "

    a new window (Window > New) for working at detail, switching to the zoomed in
    view when you need to preview?\r\n\r\nYou could also save the zoomed in view (View
    > New View).\r\n\r\n \r\n"

    you could do that in Illustrator (I clearly had no clue.)
