    better typeface with a similar \u2018G', check out [[Univers]].\r\nF\r\n\r\nP.S.
    No, the right place would have been the Type ID Board: http://typophile.com/typeid\r\nAnd:
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2\" title=\"Frequently Asked
    Question \u2013 What do I enter in the \u201CTitle\u201D line?\">Please use a
    descriptive title next time! Thank you.</a>"

  body: I am not asking for font!!!!! I am asking for "black & white simple solid
    version of this type of eagle". I think Type ID Board is the to know the font
    name. I posted it here in design forum as it related with logo.
