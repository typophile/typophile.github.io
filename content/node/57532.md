  body: My ideas about beauty in type have shifted towards doing a job well. Whereas
    the superficial prettiness of a specific glyph, especially if it gets in the way
    of utility has taken more & more of a back seat. There are plenty of type designs
    where you have both.

    Type is \u2013for the strange people like us\u2013 one of them.\r\nI am thinking
    to design a new font and right now I want to think before start what I have to
    do and what not. I mean: in my last project I started to design but with no parameters
    or goals clearly defined. And this is not a good start point because you really
    don't have how to compare if you are right or wrong in the process.\r\nIn typophile
    I learned a lot of things, and ask you a \xABtop five\xBB font ranking will be
    good to know another designs and oppinions about what are the cool and lovely
    things on type.\r\n\r\nJuan"

  body: "Mr Shinn:\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\nThat is a beautiful page. There's really
    nothing like letterpress. \r\n\r\nI love reading old E.B. White books. Most of
    them are set in either letterpress Electra or Fairfield. Whenever I read them
    I feel as if I'm part of an earlier, simpler time - on White's salt water farm
    in Maine during the late 30s or early 40s, maybe in early summer. I doubt that
    the same material set in today's laser-optimized, ultra-sharp fonts could achieve
    the same effect, respectfully. \r\n\r\nNo one could construct a sentence quite
    like E.B. White. Now combine that with a wholesome, warm, dark letterpress font
    on faintly musty, creamy paper, and what you've got is a kind of sensory and intellectual
    nirvana.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Mr Shinn, what type is being used on that page?"

    \"reading times\", the way they used to read, were totally different than what
    they are nowadays.\r\n\r\nReading and calligraphy were considered religious acts.
    Every reader would take long hours in churchs and libraries reading, with the
    big \"In folio\" books, which were tied to the seat with a chain.\r\n\r\nThe aim
    of those calligraphers of medieval times, and of the PreRafaelist ideology followers
    (SXIX and part of SXX)\r\nwas to generate a very dark black block on every page.\r\nAlthough
    they were more used than we are, to read those pages, I bet they knew that if
    they looked at the page from a meter of distance the blackness would make the
    page illegible. \r\n\r\nI think the blackletter style is full of positive points,
    like the mystic spirit it has, but the risk of not achieving the communication
    it pretends is big.\r\n\r\n\r\nLi\xE1n Types.-"
