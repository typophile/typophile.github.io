  that shows the various sexual positions? I've seen one free one on Dafont.com but
  it's not very good and I need something I can officially license.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance..\r\nScott"

    explicitly sexual, but it is nude. Not a font though. '

  body: There used to be a display font called Body but, like the one Carl linked
    to, it just used the human figure to create the letterforms, didn't exactly show
    sexual positions - unless you counted the N which showed (inadvertently?) a guy
    giving a handjob to another guy. I looked for it digitally awhile back but couldn't
    find it.

    those programs like Poser to create my own. Yes, I feel like a perv.\r\n"
