body: "Much of Cerulea's long development took place here on Typophile. You may remember
  critique threads such as these from <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/2083\">2003</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/13064\">2005</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/56237\">2009</a>,
  and may wonder what came of any of that advice. So it bears mentioning that while
  Typophile was gone, <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cerulean-stimuli/cerulea/\">the
  Cerulea family</a>, now 14 fonts with more than 800 glyphs each, was finished and
  released. If you missed the release, I am even running the same 30% off sale this
  month!\r\n\r\nWhile the \"Release\" forum is broken, I am assuming \"News\" is acceptable.
  The proper establishment of Cerulean Stimuli as a type foundry may count as news,
  at least; it took nearly a year of hazing with MyFonts, after all. There's more,
  too: Earlier this year I put out <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cerulean-stimuli/walklike/\">Walklike</a>,
  a faux-Ancient-Egyptian-hieroglyphs comic hand."
