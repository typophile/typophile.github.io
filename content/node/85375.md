  the answers I found here!!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got a question on fonts with (pseudo)
  randomization.\r\n\r\nWell, I\u2019m working on a font with 4 variants for each
  character and the calt feature\r\nworks quite good, but after a line-break the loop
  starts again.\r\n\r\nThat means you won\u2019t realize repetitions in one line of
  text,\r\nbut if the first line and the second line start with the same letter/word,\r\nthey
  appear exactly the same, which draws (unwanted) attention.\r\n\r\nCan anybody tell
  me if it is possible to let a character loop run over line-breaks?\r\nMaybe there
  is a simple answer or a thread i couldn\u2019t find?"
