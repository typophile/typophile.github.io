  for my Raffia presentation at ATypI_Vancouver. It looks like metal--see the top
  right hand corner. Does anyone know who made it / what foundry, etc. I'd like to
  see more of the letters in the font, because the way the flourishes interweave at
  bottom left is distinctive for this sort of letter, and anticipates the pattern
  in the flourishes in Raffia.\r\n\r\nhttp://www3.sympatico.ca/penneson/ALKMAAR_S.pdf"

  body: Thanks Tiffany. I am familiar with Nicolette Grey's books on lettering, but
    I haven't come across this particular specimen or others in the font there. This
    kind of letterform originated with the practice of drawing large versal with the
    same broadpen as used for writing text or notes in musical scores. Typographic
    versions of such versals are not unusual, but the raffia-like flourishes embodied
    in the bottom left and top tight corner of the specimen I showed are. Mostly the
    flourishes are of the type shown in the top left corner.

  body: Have you tried the Moorstation? I don't recall the name of the person who
    runs it and I'm not sure it is 100% above board (would be nice to know).

  body: "Tiffany & Lauri,\r\n\r\nI had a look at http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/typoasis1.htm.
    Lots of historical stuff there. So far I haven't seen my \"Alkmaar A\" (my name
    for it--the sample book I saw it in was published in Alkmaar). Most of the comparable
    material I looked at was downloadable for free (.ttf) and pulling the files into
    my old fontographer software showed hundreds of control points per glyph."

  body: "Yeah, those Moorstation-fonts are made 'quick and dirty' \u2014 presumably
    by scanning artwork and tracing these autostyle.\r\n\r\nRe your original question,
    I HAVE seen this letter(style) somewhere. In my mind it's somehow connected with
    Albrecht D\xFCrer, which would place it in the 16-hundreds. And I have a feeling
    that it has been republished in a Dover book, somewhere in the 70's (eg 30+ years
    ago).\r\n\r\nBut this is all conjecture (and proof that the mind really withers
    with aging, haha)."
