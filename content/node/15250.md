body: "Hi Typos,\r\n\r\nI'd like to explore the possibility of some lowercase forms
  in what is essential an mostly uppercase logo. A few of the letters might lend themselves
  better to lowercase forms. I'm terrible with Illustrator's beziers. Is there an
  easy way to increase a lowercase form's size to match an uppercase's x-height and
  stroke width in Illustrator or FontLab?\r\n\r\n -t\r\n\r\n"

  body: One thing you can do--and this generally will work better with a sans serif--is
    to use the lowercase from a lighter weight. If you're lucky, the strokes will
    be a nearer match.

    value to make the lowercase forms thinner.'

  body: "Thanks Mark,\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do it in FontLab via Interpolation?\r\n\r\nWas
    reading here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/SmallCaps%20How-To\r\n\r\nand here:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19011.html?1067708589\r\n\r\nabout
    interpolation. While this is kind of the opposite of making a small-cap from an
    uppercase, I thought the theory might be reversed engineered some how.\r\n\r\n

  body: Sure, just use negative values for the "Bold" transformation. (Tools > Transform...
    > Effects > Bold )
