body: "So this is my first post as a user of typophile.com and I'm excited about it.
  \ I'm an aspiring graphic design student in Ames, IA at Iowa State University.  Sort
  of accidentally falling into all of this, I've happened to go to a fantastic school
  with an award winning design program.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm taking an introduction
  to typography course and doing some research, came across typophile and a number
  of other typography blogs and forums and am now developing an undiscovered passion
  for typographic design.  \r\n\r\nMostly I'm looking forward to the learning experience
  of being a part of this site and interacting with people who are experienced in
  typography.  I'm hoping to use this as a great way to improve my design work and
  involve myself in the process of creating and identifying type. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
  totally ready to get started. "

    after the fact discovered how lucky I was to study design here. '
