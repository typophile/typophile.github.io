  body: "Nathan, the font that you posted to first is Linotype's Zapfino. \r\n\r\nBut
    the link is to a site that should not be offering it for free download! In fact,
    the site is full of fonts that should definitely not be there. Therefore, I have
    removed the link from your post.\r\n\r\nEdit: Or maybe the font is a cheap knock-off.
    But their posting this would be a no no as well."

  body: "My issue is that I'm working on a job for a client, who is clueless about
    font licensing and such. I am not sure how the original font was procured.\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to confidently be able to tell the client to purchase the real deal, (if
    they do not have it already), in order to be able to rip a PDF for them.\r\n\r\nI
    do not want to advise the client to purchase the font, if Linotype's original
    Zapfino produces similar PostScript errors. If I were a betting man, I would guess
    it wouldn't - legitimately purchased fonts would/should not have such licensing
    restrictions.\r\n\r\nBut these 2 fonts are apparently the same, as per original
    opinion?\r\n\r\nYes, the simple solution is to purchase the font. However, I must
    justify such actions for the beancounters, and ensure my course of action will
    actually be succesful.\r\n\r\n(Question: Not being a font author, does the Macromedia
    Fontographer? footprint suggest someone has modified the original Linotype Zapfino,
    and in the process caused this error.)\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help"

    can tell you that it is not the same file as the PC TT version of Zapfino One
    that is downloadable (i.e., licensable) from the Linotype website.\r\n\r\nIt would
    be best if you or your client license the font. Linotype offers customer service
    to its customers if problems ever arise. Free font sites who offer poor-functioning
    files from their URLs do not."

    their vendor ID - \"lino\" to the fonts they produce - the fact that the font
    is being attributed to Macromedia would suggest someone has been monkeying with
    the font, or used FOG to convert a Type 1 version to TTF.\r\n"

    Apart from the obvious issue of helping them improve their search rankings, and
    making their warez more accessible, within a few weeks the lawyers will have them
    shut down anyway. Who needs a dead link? "
