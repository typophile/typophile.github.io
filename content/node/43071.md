body: "While googling in search of info about Baskerville typeface I came across this
  page with lots of scans from John Baskerville books. I did a quick search in typophile
  and it seems that the link it hasn't been posted before:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.riversevenpress.co.uk/bask.html\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, this River Seven Press produces books \"by using letterpress printing\"...
  they also link http://www.britishletterpress.co.uk/.\r\n\r\nRegarding Neo-classical
  typefaces, I'd love to share some thoughts about Walbaum and Bulmer, two very nice
  fonts that doesn't seem to get the attention they deserve."

    obliged by his client to forgo his usual neoclassical austerity and work in retro
    ecclesseastical mode.\r\n\r\nIt's strange that his normal style would have been
    considered too pagan, when one considers some of the neo-classical churches being
    built at the time, resembling temples from Ancient Greece."

  body: "That's a fairly common feature in books intended either to be read aloud
    or to be followed while someone is reading/reciting aloud. The word at the bottom
    of the page is a cue for the first word on the next page, the idea being that
    you don't miss anything while you are turning the page.\r\n\r\nA similar feature
    is found in most copies of the Qur'an, and provided an opportunity for scribes
    to demonstrate their skill in writing the same word in two different ways using
    dissimilation of letterforms."
