  with the \"base glyph\"? Like in many fonts, the \xC5 is A and \xB0 joined together
  (Interstate for example). Are joined accents as a design feature considered as a
  generally bad idea? Why so?"

  body: "well, it's considered \"bad idea\", cause  joing the accents to the letter
    might suggest a special glyph/character on it's own. Many headline faces had the
    accents tightly close to the letters but still not jointed (if i'm not mistaken).\r\n\r\nIn
    the case of the uppercase A with a ring (\xC5) - it IS actually a character on
    it's own, so is considered acceptable to be jointed."

  body: "I\u2019ve heard several scandinavian actually complaining about joined A-ring.\r\nAlso,
    past acute and breve, if you start joining circumflexes, macrons and umlauts,
    you\u2019re likely to end up with something ugly and/or unrecognisable."

  body: "Hmm. I'm scandinavian myself and A-ring doesn't bother me. Maybe in text
    fonts i could see that as a problem. How about joined accents in display fonts?
    Anyone?\r\n\r\nI see no fundamental problem with joined accents as long as one
    can recognize the intended letter. I'm just curious if anyone has succeeded at
    that. "

    is something that can be developed further in my future projects.

    to make it as a diagonal flick, rather than a vertical mark.\r\nAt least, that's
    my theory.\r\nHungarian is another language with no grave accents, but all the
    \"tick\" accents are acutely slanted."

    vertical mark, even if they intend to.
