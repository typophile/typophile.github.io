body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI don't post very often, but have a great deal of respect
  for the many knowledgeable and insightful members here. I hope some of you can provide
  good suggestions and feedback for this project of mine.\r\n\r\nI have a logo which
  features Chalet for the type, and I'm trying to find a Serif for headings (and possibly
  body) to properly compliment it. I guess I'm just trying to achieve a proper balanced
  look, since the logo type is so distinctive.\r\n\r\nAny advice/suggestions are much
  appreciated, as well as any criticisms on the logo itself.  The logo is very much
  a work in progress, and I attempted some small modifications to the type (for the
  lowercase u and a).\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfontspecimens|Chalet
  Fonts]]\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:  I'm thinking a slab serif of some variety.
  Any thoughts? I saw http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/ suggested
  in another thread."

  body: "Hi Trevor,\r\n\r\nI'd probably suggest using something a little understated
    compared to Chalet. Have you seen MVB Verdigris? (But, I guess I might see Caecelia
    being used too.) \r\n\r\nAs for you logo. I don't mind the change to the lowercase
    u, but the serif on the lowercase a isn't smooth enough. In addition the u serif
    seems more rounded while the a is more attached."

  body: "Hey Trevor,\r\n\r\nI agree with Miss T. There's a lot going on the mark already,
    so choose something simple. In fact I'd be inclined to stick Chalet, but one of
    the less ornate cuts.\r\n\r\nWith the logo itself, I'd probably lose the gradient
    fade in the separating line, you don't need it. And yep, the little hair flip
    on the a needs a little smoothing."

  body: "Thanks for the input. It's hard to find good constructive criticism these
    days :)\r\n\r\nI hadn't heard of Verdigris, and it looks like another contender.
    \ I've done a few quick tests with Caecelia, and it seems to go quite well with
    the logo type. It's my current favourite. \r\n\r\nA lot of my content will be
    web-based, so that's definitely a concern when choosing fonts. I'm happy to use
    SIFR for headings and very brief paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at implementing
    those logo improvements.\r\n\r\nAttached is one of the Caecilia tests:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test2_4005.jpg]"

  body: I think Caecelia works. However isn't Caecelia a Linotype font? Their EULA
    doesn't allow for web embedding. What about Adobe's <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1718">Chapparal</a>?

  body: "Caecilia is Lino, yeah.   I wasn't aware SIFR would violate their EULA. This
    is their section on embedding:\r\n\r\n<cite>1.5 Embedding of the Font Software
    into electronic documents or Internet pages is only permitted under the absolute
    assurance that the recipient cannot use the Font Software to edit or create a
    new document (read-only). It must be ensured that the Font Software cannot be
    fully or partially extracted from said documents.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere's so many
    flash-based websites that feature commercial fonts. I would've assumed SIFR is
    no different, unless of course all those flash sites have broken the EULA too
    :)\r\n\r\nIt turns out I have Chapparal (does it comes with the Adobe apps?).
    It looks good, but not as nice as Caecilia. The bold weight is also way too heavy.
    \r\n\r\nI'm consulting Mr. Google for some clarification on the licensing thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    \ I was just comparing Caecilia and Chapparal a bit more. Caecilia is definitely
    the winner. Even if I don't use it here, I'll keep it in mind for other projects.
    It's quite impressive.\r\n\r\nDo you think [[http://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens_2.html?sku=GF060016X1P2&start=1|Freight
    Micro (book)]] would be an option?  In a world without Typophile, that's probably
    what I would've ended up choosing.  It's so expensive."

  body: Freight Micro could be a nice choice. Since you seem to be interested in humanist
    slab serifs, take a look at the ones I posted in <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/38605>this
    thread</a>. Silica is my personal favorite out of them, although the lack of an
    italic may make it a no-go. TheSerif is probably the closest you can get to Caecilia
    without being Caecilia.

    \ I'm assuming that's a correct/current EULA. Personally I wouldn't hesitate to
    use any fonts I own in flash files. If a foundry wants to get fussy and send me
    a letter, I'll happily switch to another font/foundry. I asked a few designers
    and they agreed that flash is flash, regardless of whether it's a spinning logo
    or SIFR ;) Obviously, I'll still take every reasonable precaution to ensure people
    can't rip the fonts or characters.  \r\n\r\nAuricfuzz: Thanks for that. I like
    Silica too, but it doesn't seem to mesh as well with Chalet. TheSerif looked nice,
    very similar to Caecilia.\r\n\r\nLex: To some extent I agree, but I believe the
    concept is different enough that it should be fine. A large selection of my clients
    helped choose the logo from several options. I'm still working on ways to build
    a brighter/happier looking site around it. I don't want everything appearing too
    dark and dreary.\r\n\r\nA quick experiment with colour:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test2_6631.jpg]"
