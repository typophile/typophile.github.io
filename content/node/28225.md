  sets British typography apart from the others; like the Dutch et cetera?

  body: I'd say that British typography tends to be more varied and has bit more character
    than alot of central European and Scandy design and a little more restraint than
    work that comes out of the US.

  body: "Hi there, I am an English graphic designer working in Sweden. Just thought
    I would put in my 10 pence worth. \r\n\r\nMijlee is correct when he says that
    British typography can be a little more varied. I think that this has something
    to do with the fact that British desigh is very idea based. Each project is approached
    in a different way, some may call for illustrations, some may call for typographic
    solotions and so on.\r\n\r\nWorking in Sweden at the moment I find that Scandinavian
    design is very trend led. You tend to find a lot of similar work coming out different
    companies at certain points in time. The Scandinavians are very trend led in general,
    especially when it comes to Fashion and Architecture, this can also be said of
    graphic design. For instance, over the last year I have seen a tremendous amount
    of illustrative design come out of sweden, next year it could be something completely
    different but I asure you that many companies within Sweden will be doing similar
    things. \r\n\r\nThen you have the Dutch and Swiss, both very different in the
    way they approach design, the Swiss, very precise and formal and very beautiful
    indeed. The dutch, very playful but they share the Swiss characteristics of form
    and function. \r\n\r\nAnd then the Americans, a little less restrained and a little
    more open. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of it has to do with the markets that you are
    working in. I have a friend in New York working, and he sometimes finds it hard
    to introduce his British style into the industry. The clients are either not ready
    for it or they just dont understand. But this happens everywhere, all around the
    world, and I think if you cross reference each countryies styles they will all
    overlap in some form or another. \r\n\r\nBut its very important within ones own
    climat to keep an underlying connection to their traditions. It make them who
    they are, but then there is also a need to break out of the box and adapt to other
    forms. \r\n\r\nI still keep a very close connection to the ways I was taught at
    University in England, but I understand that I am working in Scandinavia and that
    calls for maybe a more simple way of working. The markets here can be quite small
    and so sometimes you have to play it safe, whilst still try to make a mark, it
    can be quite challenging sometimes. \r\n\r\nThats just my opinion, hope it sheds
    some light. I am sure you will get many more good opinions on this topic, we all
    approach things in different ways, if we didnt then it would be a pretty boring
    world. \r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As a Swede who's worked in London (although that was a while ago, 98-99),
    I can agree with what Matt's saying, but I think it's mostly because Sweden's
    such a small country. \r\n\r\nAnd also I think some of the fads are more client-driven
    than designer-driven. \r\n\r\nPlus, most designers here have gone to the same
    few schools, and share a way of approaching things (but would never admit it).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, every time I go to London I marvel at the sheer creativity and talent you
    see in graphic design everywhere."
