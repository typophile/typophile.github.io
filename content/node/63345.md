body: "My new side project.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mode-pic_4193.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
  was the result of another type experiment. I wondered how it would look if I took
  the underlying architecture of [[http://www.typophile.com/node/55891|Mint]] and
  made a rounded, extended version. The forms are boxy and the junctures follow the
  same rules as Mint.\r\n\r\nI wanted to reconcile 'flared' with 'monoline', so most
  of the stroke contrast from Mint has gone, leaving the quite interesting blobbiness
  in the counters and on the terminals. \r\n\r\nI haven't yet really thought about
  spacing or kerning so I haven't put a sample of running text. And of course with
  my lack of skill at numerals, those haven't appeared yet.\r\n\r\nI think this might
  work mainly for titling and/or small bits of text like addresses. I plan to try
  a bolder weight which may be more suitable for words in sentences. "

    happening on the y, but don't see the same treatment on the t for example.

  body: "Hum, yeah, I guess I do take a fractal approach to things, life is like that
    for me. One thing branches off another, everything has a cause and effect...this
    side project could quite easily spawn a whole lot of new avenues for me. It could
    be hard coming up with four-letter M-names though ;)\r\n\r\nI think turning all
    the angles into curves would make this really predictable. The interest for me
    is in following the rules I had for Mint, but adding in the rules about contrast,
    width and terminal shape. The capital K was the inspiration for this, it came
    to me when waking up one morning before getting out of bed (funny first thought
    I know!) and I think it works beautifully. The sharpness on its juncture stops
    it clogging too much, allowing three interesting counterspaces. But who knows,
    there could be another branch of this family where there are no sharp counters
    anywhere.\r\n\r\nAt some point one needs to stop branching sideways and start
    finishing endings."

    to be interesting but avoiding distracting spottiness; I imagine the solutions
    will come from visual judgements about specific letterforms rather than consistent
    rule application. \r\n\r\nOf course the acute angles will be tough, and your M
    and N do come off as spotty. Is there something you can do to pull apart those
    vertices (a kind of IVI treatment)? - but then how do you round the top, right?
    (That treatment of the top of M is something I'm still perplexed by for my Emi.)\r\n\r\nLove
    the J, O, D, K, r. That D hits it just right. The X intersection isn't lining
    up for me.\r\n\r\nI think the armature of a wide monoline sans (like an extended
    light Univers) is a *great* one to hang this treatment on. The effect is a bit
    like hand-drawn type (where the blobbiness at the stroke ends come from a pen
    starting or stopping). Very appealing."

    pulling apart the vertices means squaring off the top or giving a round top a
    weirdly large radius. My other concern is that the contrast of M and N is much
    higher than D or O, so I'll need to decide which way to harmonise it. \r\n\r\nI
    suppose an indirect inspiration here would be Bryant, which I'm using all the
    time at work these days. \r\n\r\nI like the inky, printy feel of the blobby terminals
    too. "

    think M and N vertices are working pretty well, but the middle vertex of W looks
    blobby. (and high?)\r\nI don't like heavy g yet, and I also am bothered by the
    tiny aperture of heavy e. If I can be frank, the heavy weight of this is nowhere
    near as interesting as the regular to me. I think once the strokes move from being
    lines to being shapes, the terminal-and-taper treatment is less unconventional.
    That's not to discourage you from developing it, of course."

    I hadn't noticed the W but you're right that needs the same attention. \r\n\r\nYes,
    the mouth of e is quite tight and not very good especially at small sizes. Sounds
    like I need to do something like with the a. The lc g is a problem. Need to work
    some magic there. Hm.\r\n\r\nDo you think the heavy needs the stroke contrast
    lowered then, to make it more monoline? That will be really hard as the counters
    get in the way vertically more than horizontally."

    Or maybe the almost-but-not-quite parallel top and bottom of that bottom counter
    is what makes it seem not quite right\r\n\r\n<em>Do you think the heavy needs

    keep going for at least enough letters to make sentences.\r\n\r\nYes, some of
    the letters need a bit more thought. I only had the concept on the bus yesterday
    and so the forms are still not quite there. The g and y especially aren't quite

    u, o and n are quite wide but then perhaps the other glyphs need widening instead.
    Not sure yet.\r\n\r\nThe b and d are intentionally different and p and q will
    follow the same pattern. As with the original font, Mint, I wanted to create tension
