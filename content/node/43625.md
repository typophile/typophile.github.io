  on what this is? \r\n\r\nI thought it would be a quick ID but I've spent a good
  part of the afternoon searching without any luck at all. Thanks for the help."

  body: 'That''s great. I passed over Akzidenz Grotesque initially because of some
    slight differences: the lowercase c has a slightly protruding jaw, the e is not
    as closed, the r is narrower. It does seem to be Basic Commercial, but boy are
    they similar.'

  body: Yup, we usually don't like derivative designs that much, but to say that the
    current Berthold owner has a dodgy reputation would be a severe understatement.

    this very design for ages. It just had to be renamed to Basic Commercial.

    the Adobe/Linotype AG share the <a href=\"http://www.bertholdtypes.com/info/FAQ.html#6\">exact
    same outlines</a>.\r\n\r\nI want my credit!"

    And I identified an AG sample as BC before and got the credit, so I say you should

    (Berthold/Adobe). About wanting the credit, I was just kidding.

  body: "I wasn\u2019t sure if they are exactly the same point for point but I know
    BC is look-a-like of Akzidenz... all the credit goes to Jan of course! I just
    suggested Akzidenz because it has more features and weights etc which might be
    a better choice for Don.\r\n\r\nDidn\u2019t Bruno Steinhart make an admission
    about Basic Commercial? I forget all the details.\r\n\r\nJan that last link pointed
    to something else: there is Berthold Quality versions and Adobe Berthold versions,
    which are less complete but that has nothing to do with basic commercial- at least
    I think.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: Look up "Harvey Hunt" and make up your own opinion. ;^) It hasn't got anything
    to do with outlines but with how you treat other type designers and even the type
    designers whose designs you resell.
