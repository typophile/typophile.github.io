  time I went straight into the computer to start building the letters without having
  skated out what I was going to do first and now I am second guessing myself. Maybe
  it's just the lack of sleep that is keeping me from liking this but I can't figure
  out at this moment what it is that bothers me about it.\r\n\r\nNot going to get
  into the politics of why it has to be done in this rushed manner if it is going
  to get done at all. I will only disclose that I am trying to covertly insert as
  much quality as I can into the redesign of the magazine despite begin straightjacketed
  in what I am permitted to do. \r\n\r\nThe letters are still in separate pieces so
  the serifs joining the ligatures are off as there not done yet. Concerned about
  the width of the serifs on the \"F\" and \"E\". Not sure on the tail of both \"R's\".
  Also contemplating making the \"A\" a bit wider.\r\n\r\nPlease don't pull any punches
  in the critique and be very specific.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WIP_masthead_sample_6566.jpg]"

    a little bit of weight to the crossbar? I would have taken another look at the
    transition to serif in the left diagonal. Its top serif is a little tame, no?\r\nS:
    The spine appears slightly bumpy in the top/right side curve. \r\nR: Where the
    leg and bowl of the R meets, there is a dark spot. The bowl is not as \u201Cdetermined\u201D
    as similar curves in S.\r\nO: I think I would have tried to make the internal
    white less pointy in the top and bottom.\r\nU: Needs some work on the transition
    from straight to curve on the right side of the left stem.\r\nF: I would reconsider
    the width. Narrower, IMO.\r\n\r\n(I suspect I\u2019m not qualified to give a proper
    critique, but I would love to see if someone else also notices the things I do.)"

  body: Well, the one obvious thing is that the apex of the A falls far too short.
    It should overshoot at least as high as the serifs go. The plunge of the N, on
    the other hand, is rather extreme, and might better be truncated like the other
    N's.

  body: "I too noticed the |A| looking a bit short compared to the surrounding letters.
    Also the different treatment of |N|, while understandable, is especially striking
    because of the proximity of the three.\r\nWhat bothers me a little is the \u201CConnoisseur\u201D
    part. I can\u2019t pinpoint it, but it gives me the impression of being a bit
    cramped, or too dark, or too close to \u201CFine Art\u201D, or uneven, or a combination
    of the above.\r\n"

    of what was listed I found to be spot on and even the suggested tweaks that I
    don't quite agree with helped me spot areas were further refinement can occur.\r\n\r\nIn
    particular, the comments on the top serif of the \"A\" being a little tame and
    short made me laugh as I was caught red handed. That was a last second adjustment
    I made when I realized that the original apex I was planing on creating could
    of been noticed by a non typophile and I could of very well received a directive
    of \"Don't use any font with a weird \"A\" for the masthead.\" Of course, this
    is 100% made from scratch but that is an incomprehensibly alien notion to the
    powers that be. Covertly inserting quality, is the only strategy that stands a
    chance.\r\n\r\nThanks once more and keep it coming if there is more that can be

  body: "A Google search for the existing magazine indicates that the mast never covers
    the artwork or other graphics, and I'm assuming that will be the case going forward
    as well. \r\n\r\nEven so, does the magazine depend on newsstand sales, or is it
    solely based on subscriptions? What I'm getting at is that from a distance, those
    ultra-thin strokes tend to disappear, which compromises both aesthetics and readability.\r\n\r\nIf
    the design of the cover ever does change to accommodate full-bleed imagery, those
    thin strokes will really cause problems \u2014 from most any distance."

    spent the weekend recutting each letter.\r\n\r\nThylacine, you are correct that
    the logo will still be seen on top of white and never over any artwork. The magazine
    is 9 inches wide so the mast is quite large and newsstand read is therefore not
    compromised. \r\n\r\nIt may interest you to know that in the U.S., even though
    magazines are sold on newsstands, after a few years in business the paid subscriptions
    becomes the largest portion of paid circulation. I have worked on magazines from
    a few different countries so I know that in those other countries newsstands sales
    tend to outperform paid circulation.\r\n\r\nPlease don't pull any punches in the
    critique and be very specific.\r\n\r\nThanks once more."

    not quite recapture the grace of the big R.

  body: All improvements. I agree on the need to better harmonise the two |R| legs
    (I for one, prefer the less "clawy" joining of the smaller |R|, but its stroke
    is indeed too heavy).

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WIP_masthead_sample_100_3982.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the input. I did indeed decide to reconsider the thickness of the smaller
    R's tail and also made the transition slightly more graceful. Funny that the cut
    of the R's tails which I consider to be the most, if not the only, original aspect
    of the mark is what is drawing such attention and opposing opinions. It is funny
    that I cannot recollect having seen a junction to tail transition cut exactly
    like this before even though the cuts at the top of an R's tail is an ideal that
    has been around for a very long time.  Now I am curious if anyone, has in the
    past, spotted an R who's tail has the same \"clawy\" cut as the one I devised. "

  body: "For the capital R, I would try to expand the right leg slightly towards the
    baseline. Or rather, make it slightly narrower towards the bowl. I suspect this
    optical correction is mostly due to the inherent \u201Cgravity\u201D of letterforms.
    I\u2019m not yet entirely satisfied with the transition from straight to curve
    in your serifs. Have a closer look at the transitions in the diagonals, and also
    both sides of the stem in R. I would keep the lower right \u201Ccut\u201D in N
    in the smaller size. The same goes for R\u2019s junction\_\u2013 more equal in
    both sizes. Consider being even more flamboyant in the apex of A. It should relate
    to R and N."

  body: "I suppose the final product is long out the door, but I had a few observations:\r\n\r\nThe
    new masthead is going to be considerably taller than the old one, changing the
    balance of the entire cover. Assuming that was approved as acceptable before design
    started.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the same stem width between the two lines of text
    creates an awkward juxtaposition. The top line looks elegant and airy while the
    bottom one ends up looking almost thuggishly short. It creates a visual incongruity
    beyond that which is difficult to put a finger on. A certain dissonance.\r\n\r\nThe
    double \"s\" in connoisseur has a visual density that attracts attention to itself.
    I feel like they should be a bit wider to open them up.\r\n\r\nThe unique treatments
    of the upper line \"n\" and the \"r\"s looks a little weird because they call
    attention to themselves. Everything else looks classical and so they end up looking
    like gratuitous flourishes.\r\n\r\nDon't like the differing treatment of the \"n\"s.
    It's discordant. "
