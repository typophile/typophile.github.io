body: "I have problem with automatic contextual replacement in InDesign f.e. with
  such code\r\n\r\nsub space b' by b.alt;\r\n\r\nit works only after usual or non-breaking
  space, but when after a 'emdash' is inserted thin space \u2014 the replacement not
  works automatically, then I must insert alternate manually via 'glyphs palette'.
  What can I do to resolve this problem? Or it's impossible?"

  body: you could write more code with the necessary lookups or switch your b and
    b.alt

    alternates does not look as good decision because I already have about five alternatives

  body: "I think you better go by the reverse logic. Identify the beginning of a word
    not by presence of space but by absence of letters:\r\n\r\n@anyLetter = [a b c
    ...];\r\nignore sub @anyLetter b';\r\nsub b' b.alt;\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier
    to deal with different spaces, punctuation marks, numbers, currency symbols, math
    symbols, etc.\r\nIn case you do <em>not</em> want to see the b-to-b.alt replacement
    if, for example, a period precedes the word, then simply include period in the
    @anyLetter class."
