  comment on Seravek? Much like Clearview ADA it seems a good choice. \r\nCompare

    What about <A HREF="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008">Gotham</A>
    or <A HREF="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=myriad&x=0&y=0">Myriad</A> or <A

  body: "Hi Chris,\r\nI've looked at Myriad (Pro) and Frutiger--both are very decent
    faces and will be assessed at the 'audience testing stage'. \r\nGotham is nice,
    with a generous set-width and x-height; however, it has the appearance of having
    shorter ascenders and descenders. \r\n\r\nSeravek displays good character differentiation
    between p & q, b & d, and between capital i and lowercase L; furthermore, it displays
    generous set-width and a generous x-height. Also, Seravek's lowercase alphabet
    possess characteristics that are would be familiar, and perhaps more legible,
    for people with learning disabilities--such as the curved tail on the lowercase
    L. \r\n\r\nWhich characteristics are you unhappy with? It is quirky, and for that
    reason I'm unsure about its suitability to my current project. \r\nBut it may
    just be that Seravek's quirky characteristics are born from a need for an 'Inclusive'
    typeface. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n"

  body: "I think trying to make a typeface fix or compensate for learning disabilities
    is misguided and a red herring. I apologize if this sounds harsh. It is an admirable
    impulse to wish to help those with disabilities, but unfortunately there are so
    many variables affecting the success of printed communication, it's a waste of
    time to fixate on typefaces for too long. \r\n\r\nRead Regular has so many other
    flaws that it is sub-functional as a typeface. It's really a shame that it comes
    recommended especially for such a purpose. For example, while there is some differentiation
    between certain ambiguous shapes, other, normally unambiguous shapes have been
    made more similar; very common vowels a and o now look the same, especially since
    the drawing of the typeface is so inexpert; where strokes join in 'a' could be
    carefully modeled to make the tail more explicit, and yet it's monoline, like
    Comic Sans, its execrable predecessor. Rather than a recognizable, distinct angular
    y shape, a curved y, like a u with a tail, is provided instead. For a specialized
    typeface intended for a special-needs audience, would you hire a complete novice
    at type design? That's who designed Read Regular. Some of the design precepts
    of Read Regular are simply wrong. \r\n\r\nTypefaces perform differently depending
    on how they are used. Typeface legibility can be destroyed by bad spacing or inappropriate
    setting. Their performance depends on their application. Are the subjects expected
    to improve their reading abilities over time? Then consider techniques for teaching
    reading: larger sizes, open spacing, short texts, simple vocabulary. Do the subjects
    have visual limitations? Reduce the challenges to reading by maximizing contrast,
    setting type in large sizes, improving the reading environment with lighting and
    seating, and finally, choosing well-spaced and well-designed faces to begin with.
    Choose typefaces with clear differentiation between shapes, open counters and
    apertures, and expert spacing, like Meta, Absara, Freight, Versa, Beorcana, Eva,
    Amira, Productus, Chaparral, or Whitman. Bad typefaces, because of their inherent
    ambiguity, tight spacing, and monotonous construction, would be Helvetica, Arial,
    Interstate, Bodoni, or Courier. \r\n\r\nFinally, you don't specify what the learning
    disabilities are. Dyslexia, low vision, and other learning disabilities are not
    equivalent, and not necessarily addressed with the same techniques."

  body: "Hi Carl,\r\nSorry for the delay in replying. \r\nI wasn't offended at all;
    I didn't think you were harsh\u2013-It's nice to have your comments.\r\nUnfortunately,
    I cannot be very precise about which learning difficulties the guide is for, because
    the service group supports a multitude of different disabilities, making the whole
    task very difficult indeed. However, dyslexia, and low vision would most certainly
    be two entirely different disabilities that would need to be considered for the
    project.\r\n\r\nI looked at the typefaces you recommend--a mix of seriffed and
    sans seriffed typefaces. So, are you against a monoline stroke for use in inclusive
    design? I wasn't quite sure? I've always had it in my mind, and from the mountains
    of reading that I've completed, that a relatively geometric sans serif are most
    suitable for learning difficulties (again, apologies for the broad term). \r\n\r\nThe
    guide will be far from text heavy, relying on symbols and singular lines of text.
    Therefore, I thought that something like New Johnston (London Transport's typeface)
    would be the paradigm. It has large apertures; a generous set-width and x-height;
    some differentiation eg, the connective at the bottom of the lowercase L--preventing
    confusion with capital i (Il); and it is works well in large and small sizes.
    What are your views?\r\n\r\nI think something like Meta could be suitable for
    this particular kind of Information design, but it has a rather narrow set-width,
    which, from what I've read, makes it less suitable than others--namely Avenir.
    \r\nHowever, I would like to solve a few of the problems of character differentiation
    and Avenir just doesn't do that--although it's a great typeface.  \r\n"
