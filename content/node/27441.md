  but for reflective art not transparencies.\r\n\r\nMy scanner (Agfa Snapscan) is
  lovely, but it only goes up to 1200 dpi.\r\nI want to image printed type at microscopic
  resolution.\r\n\r\nI had the same problem with the Octavo version of Bodoni's Manuale.
  Need. More. Res.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a scanner solution, rather than a camera
  or microscope solution.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n"

  body: OK, but if a CoolScan does 4000 dpi at 35mm size for under $1000, is there
    nothing remotely like that for reflective art?

  body: "Nick:\r\n\r\nYou don't want to buy one. You just want a scan done on one.
    Most large printing houses or pre-press specialists should have a drum scanner
    available. In your city, Grafikom (was Quebecor MIL) has a good reputation. I'm
    sure there are others.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that they'll need to wrap your printed
    type around the drum. So bound books are out. Unless you want to involve that
    camera you mentioned.\r\n\r\nDrum scanners provide great resolution. But the technology
    is becoming dated. Some printers are now tending towards high-end large-format
    flatbeds. They might offer the resolution you require. Check with your friendly
    neighbourhood printing house.\r\n"

    to 3600 non interpolated. The 35mm scans are not up to par, but the 4x5 are medium
    quality. What really makes it work is the SilverFast software.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_6533.html\r\n\r\nThis
    new scanner has good resolution, but also has a wet mount option. Comes with SilverFast,
    and has the ICE dust and scratch removal.\r\n\r\nI would buy it if I was in the
    market."

  body: "In the past, I have achieved excellent results with the <a href=\"http://www.seyboldreports.com/SRPS/subs/2811/html/scanner2.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Heidelberg QuickStep</a> (search for \"Quickstep\" on the page
    to get the lowdown). Its optical resolution is 2400 dpi, but it can interpolate
    up to 9600 dpi (4800 is as high as I have scanned -- 35mm slides -- but the results
    were excellent).\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that it sold new for around 20,000 US
    dollars. The good news (maybe) is that the printing company I work for has TWO
    of them sitting around doing nothing (the result of three mergers in the past
    two years, and the fact that almost all of the files we receive these days are
    digital), and my boss might be amenable to parting with one of them at an attractive
    price; I can ask him on Monday, if you're interested (you can tell me your best-price
    offer at himself-at-nicksfonts dot com, and I'll see what I can do)."

  body: "I use an Epson Perfection 4490 PHOTO flatbed scanner at work. It claims 4800ppi
    X 9600ppi optical resolution. It's pretty fast too, but attaches only via USB
    2.0. My home desktop scanner is an older Epson Perfection 2450 model, but that
    model featured USB 2.0 and Firewire connections.\r\n\r\nAnyone have really old,
    yet expensive, scanners gathering dust? Back in 1998 I spent $1300 on a SCSI-based
    Linotype Hell Saphir scanner. Its transparancy adapter covered the full scanning
    bed unlike many newer scanners (including those Epsons I mentioned). The accompanying
    software was very good too. It's just too bad the thing only went to 1200ppi on
    optical resolution."

    Creo was bought out by Kodak. You may want to check out these scanners, I'm sure
    they all cost a bundle though... <A HREF="http://graphics.kodak.com/global/product/scanners/professional_scanners/default.htm">Kodak
