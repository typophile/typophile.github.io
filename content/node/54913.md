body: I'm looking for a thick, substantial titling serif, similar to H&FJ's <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100022">Saracen</a>,
  but with a classic bracketed serif. Any suggestions?

  body: Zocalo is attractive, but I particularly like how Saracen is thick on all
    strokes, though there is some contrast. I also like the fairly conventional lettershapes,
    which Zocalo does have, while Traktorekta doesn't so much.

  body: "Hmm. Might be tough to find something heavy for display, but with modest
    contrast and classical serif structure. \r\n\r\nSubstantial, titling, and bracketed
    serifs usually leads to high contrast. Conversely, substantial and low contrast
    usually leads to slab or wedge serifs.\r\n\r\nWhat about something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/iowan-old-style/black-osf-bt/|Iowan
    Old Style Black]]?\r\n\r\n"

  body: That's great, Kentlew! I may very well use Iowan, assuming no one's got a
    better suggestion.
