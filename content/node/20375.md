body: "Dear All,\r\n\r\nI am an architect with a strong interest in all things type
  related and I am in the process of getting a sign made for my house/apartment here
  in Japan and for when we return to Australia. The sign will be made of laser cut
  steel plate (similar to the sign by Peter Verheul in the attached image http://www.farhill.nl/02_lettering/applettering.html).\r\n\r\nI
  would like to use a calligraphic such as FF Quadraat (please forgive my poor grasp
  of the lexicon!) as I love their letterforms and especially those of the italics
  (and I have an existing license of the family).\r\n\r\nThe final sign may simply
  have our family name (Dunlop as you can probably guess!) or we may include an additional
  line above of 'Grant & Yoko' in a smaller point size. The obvious problem is with
  the counters in some of the characters (D, O, P, a, o, p) especially and the process
  of laser cutting them. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be two obvious approaches to solving
  this problem:\r\n\r\n1. Find an alternative 'stencil' type font which possesses
  the same calligraphic feel of FF Quadraat (or Fedra Serif for example) which would
  be suitable for a stencil type use.\r\n\r\n2. Modify the problematic characters
  of an existing font to make it suitable for stenciling.\r\n\r\nA third less obvious
  solution is to design a character/font from scrarch which fits the purpose. This
  could be possible but I may then never end up with a sign! \r\n\r\nI have taken
  a look at some of the other 'stencil' threads (Wallflower:) http://typophile.com/node/4933
  & http://typophile.com/node/15078 here and they have provided some inspiration to
  tackle the third option. Peter Verheul's letters and signs are also an inspiration
  and a spur.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if anybody could provide some advice for
  the first two options: any fonts which fit the first options and what the correct
  process would be for obtaining permission to alter those problem characters to make
  them suitable for the purpose.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your responses.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGrant
  Dunlop\r\n"

  body: There's nothing to prohibit you from customizing a type for this purpose.
    You just can't resell, or redistribute it. Most foundries allow you to preview
    type, you could preview your desired text and do a rough edit in photoshop (removing
    bits of letters) to see if it would work. Once you've landed on the type you like
    you can either edit yourself, or hire a typographer to edit the characters for
    you. There are plenty of capable folks on this site. Best of luck.

  body: "One piece of advice: the letters in a font (or a logotype) have to belong
    together. When you introduce cuts in letters like \"D\" and \"o\" out of necessity,
    consider also adding cuts in letters that don't absolutely need them, out of style.
    And this can affect where you put the cuts in the letters that necessarily need
    them. For example, in \"Dunlop\" it might look best to disjoin the stem and the
    arch in \"u\" and \"n\"... and as a result of that probably disjoin the \"p\"
    at the top instead of at the bottom... and as a result of <cite>that</cite> you
    might cut the \"o\" at the bottom, to have a low-high-low-high cut pattern in
    the whole.\r\n\r\nBTW, taking a cue from Eben:\r\nIf you need somebody to carefully
    do all this slicing\r\nfor you, I'm available: hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      clearing that up. I intend to just stick with modifying Quadraat for the time
      being.\r\n\r\nI am quite partial to Fountain/Peter Bruhn's 'Eric Sans' face
      and which seems to lend itself to this purpose. I am not sure how well it would
      take to the modifications which are needed - it may destroy the elegant simplicity
      of the letterforms. I may contact Peter Bruhn to get his opinion on modifying
      Eric Sans for this use.\r\n\r\nEben & Hrant - thanks for the offer but I think
      that I will try to do this myself as it seems to be something which is not beyond
      my current skills (perhaps wishful thinking!).\r\n\r\nIt also provides a nice
      little introduction to letterforms and my ultimate aim of producing my own font
      at some time. Dreams of joining Frank Lloyd Wright, Neutra and Enric Miralles
      among the architects who have designed their own fonts (I wish I could also
      achive the same architecturally!).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGrant"

    will become more confusable as letters, but it just looks a little imbalanced
    this way. 2) The \"D\" looks unhappy; I guess try cutting it elswhere.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    looking at the \"simulations\", it struck me that, because of the \"environmental\"
    strain placed on decipherability, you might want to make the \"el\" taller, to
    give it the character (hence decipherability) it lacks even in the best of circumstances.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I agree with Hrant. The l does get lost. Making it taller seems smart. I
    wonder if spacing the letters a little wider would help as well since there is
    more time to read the image and the size is large. The face you are changing was
    designed to be used/read at much smaller sizes and the spacing was set for that
    purpose. Since you are changing many of the assumed variables that went into the
    design you may want to modify the face even further. For cues as to what changes
    to consider look at faces that have a display & a text version & compare them.
    Tiffany's point about the p is right on. You may have to exagerate the connection.
    Connecting at the bottom looks more successful to me.\r\n\r\nIf you do get frustated
    feel free to ask one of us typophiles for professional help. \r\n\r\nAlso check
    this out: It's not cut out ina stenciled manner but it looks quite fine because
    it is smart about materials, contrasts and the effect of weathering:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arthurquentinsign_3707.jpg]\r\n\r\nMaking

  body: "Dear Miss Tiffany, Hrant & Eben,\r\n\r\nThank you for your replies and suggestions.\r\n\r\nI
    have modified the letterforms a little bit more but I am now worried that the
    changes are taking them a long way from the original letterforms - to something
    which is not what I expected (wanted). I guess this shouldn't be such a suprise
    considering I am taking Quadraat outside its normal area of use. My main concern
    is that the changes are working against the nature of Quadraat. I would like to
    see if there are perhaps more natural ways of breaking up the letterforms which
    are in keeping with the pen strokes which the font seems to be modelled on.\r\n\r\nI
    would be grateful if any one can point me in the direction of any references to
    study the stroke order or construction of Quadraat and similar 'calligraphic'
    fonts? Understanding the strokes and construction will hopefully help me in placing
    the breaks themselves and how they could be designed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGrant"

    writing\r\npublished 2005\r\nTranslated by Peter Enneson\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/titles/stroke/index.html\r\n\r\nIt's
    a lovley object in addition to being very interesting & theory rich. I think that
    just the bit about the process that created blackletter/fraktur/bastarda is worth
    the price of the book. \r\n\r\n> Understanding the strokes and construction will
    hopefully help me in placing\r\n> the breaks themselves and how they could be
    designed.\r\n\r\nEither way, you won't get a recipe for cutting your letters.
    Just information about stroke stuctures in conventional calligraphy. I think it's
    a smart place to start looking. \r\n\r\nTalking about cuts: if you go that route
    -  they are also going to have to have to support word & letter recognition, and
    avoid uneven color in the word form. That's why Hrant was talking about modification
    of more that the 'problem' letters too. The problem with cuts is that unless they
    are made in a clever way they jump out at you in a distracting way.\r\n\r\nRather
    than thinking in terms of 'cuts' you could think instead of a modified stroke
    - one that creates a gap. You could write out the forms yourself allowing for
    the breaks. Or look for a way to simulate this in the forms of Quadraat. Again,
    you would want to apply this approach for an even looking visual effect.\r\n\r\nOr
    you could Drill out the forms of the letters in circles of various sizes, so that
    the letter appears to be 'made' from holes like random-ish bubbles of different
    sizes filling up the target letter form.\r\n\r\nI guess that my suggestion for
    two contrasting metals isn't distracting you - huh? \r\n\r\n;-)\r\n\r\nYou could
    also do something po-mo like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minitorontocontruction_3713.jpg]\r\n\r\nAfter

    a difference between text fonts and display fonts, and Quadraat is [mostly] the
    former - while your application is entirely the latter.\r\n2) As you say, Quadraat
    is a \"calligraphic\" (better termed chirographic) design, and I personally think
    that works against a signage/stencil application.\r\n\r\nI know you like Quadraat,

    stuff was best suited to display faces - not text faces. Or are you just against
    Quadraat/Chirography in *all* cases?\r\n\r\nOf course you are right Quadraat is
    a face intented for text purposes. I am not sure that the chirographic quality
    of the face enters into the issue for Grant except in his handeling of the breaks
    or cuts.\r\n\r\nThat Quadraat is a text face doesn't preclude a modified version
    rendered suitable for display size. It is true that a pro would be better suited
    to the task that Grant is going to be - but maybe it doesn't have to happen tomorrow
    and Grant can learn how. I would suggest increasing the contrasts between thicks
    & thins for a start, spacing the letters a bit further apart maybe and maybe making
    the letters slightly wider too.\r\n\r\nGrant, why did you pick Quadraat anyway?
    I really like it myself. It has a rough hewn & vigorous quality. It feels very
    intentional rather than whimsical or processed.\r\n\r\nBut Hrant is right. It
    isn't the easiest place to start from. On the other hand getting a certain 'feeling'
    into a face that doesn't have it is even harder."

    example you posted. To most passersby, unless the sign is right at face level,
    near the viewer (which signs never are, to people driving past looking for your
    house), a gray metal sign on a grayish background with reflections and shadows
    is going to be "ambiguous" at best. I would concentrate on finding an appropriate
    material to contrast with the background, and find a way to make the sign that
    doesn''t require connecting links to hold the counters in place. It could be a
    piece of flashed glass (thin colored layer on clear) sandblasted so the colors
    contrast, and it could be lit from behind. for that matter, since you''re an architect,
    I don''t know why you aren''t considering just having the letters themselves cut
    out and mounted on steel pins as is done on buildings. Then, you can choose any
    typeface that is clear and strong. Is that too obvious? It''s simpler... '
