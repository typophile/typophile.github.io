		<div class="commentbody">Just  out of curiosity, may I ask you what the 2 words mean? I've been in Croatia many times and one of the words sounds familiar.
I like it when the 2 words join in more than one point (so the first is not my favourite) so that it looks like an image rather than 2 separate words (if it makes sense) but I leave it to the experts! oh, I also like the fact that it's not very conventional for a metal band. I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Sandro. I guess this is much easier for native Croatian speakers to get their heads around. Please take what I say in the spirit of objective critique only:

Personally I have a problem with the loop of the 'g' doubling for the bowl of the 'e' on the lower line. In order to read the 'g' the 'e' has to become something else - so the arrangement compromises the readability of the second line anyway.

Why a lowercase 'd' to start the logo and an uppercase 'S' halfway through it? Does Croatian capitalise proper nouns?

Why the extended stroke of the finishing 't'? It doesn't balance the 'S'. The negative shape below the second line is awkward (it would be anyway with this letter combination, but...)

The dotless 'i' and 'j' in the second line appear to be dotless only because their baseline is with the 'e' (not enough vertical space). And the 'e' is only that high because you want it to be part of the 'g' above... this is maybe not a strong enough reason for compromising the 'i' and 'j' by removing their dots. 

Are they a 'classical' band? Why use a 'classical' type style? 

What aspect of the idea of 'another world' is being incorporated into the arrangement? Where is the design actually crossing boundaries?

Contrary to what Lore says above, I think it <em>should</em> look like a rock band, in a conventional sense. There are many other ways to start exploring this name visually, so I advise you to return to the drawing board.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's very pleasing aesthetically, and I agree with Lore, it's good that you're doing a metal logo that doesn't fall into the usual cliches, but I'm not sure that this is strong enough to attract attention on posters, CD covers, and t-shirts. If I was working on this I'd print it out on 11x17 in a couple colors, stick it up on a brick wall, and use that to decide if it's really strong enough to do the job.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Uf where to start. Thank you all. Ben especially.
jpad thanks for comments ( I like it aesthetically too :D :).

Lore thanks again for your comments ( I'll do some more work, thank for your kindly comments).


They wanted it something more classical and yes they are more rock then metal band (they have only one metal song).

They wanted old classical look.

<strong>Do you have other type styles in mind </strong>, and I also think that there are more problems with e and g, but everyone were able to read that so dunno, maybe it is wrong by the rules but they read it succesfully :D.

And I just want it for T to be <em>different</em> adding that "upper" extended stroke. I wanted capital S to balance with T. I failed...

And at the end, I respect critiques so no problem Ben you helped me ( I had same thoughts, e and g and rest), btw any other another world ideas :D.

I did something so check it out.(new logo applied on cd cover). Btw Ravens are element of logo:).

And do you have any good suggestions for typewriter fonts styles?

		<div class="commentbody">Sandro it's better than the first ones – I can actually read it, although that plant stem going into the second word compromises the 'i' and the 'j' of 'Svijet', and because it's essentially an arbitrary element, why leave it (the plant stem) there?

Ravens huh? Are they ghost ravens? Is that why they're outlined in white?

Clichés exist for a reason... including the cliché of so-called design educator suggesting that the essential communication issue in the composition is not being addressed, and that the design should be redrawn experimentally <em>by hand</em> starting with a choice of coherent ideas as a basis. (So I think Kevin's right about where you're starting from – but then I do this sort of thing in my day job).</div>

i don't know how many variations you have tried, however, it looks like you've tried maybe 10 and are just stuck. don't get caught up in the typeface selection.

like everyone's said, try sketching a bunch of versions. sure, the computer is easier to manipulate but without a strong concept, your execution will fail.

there are lots of great typefaces out there. one of my new favorite foundries is www.typetrust.com you can find some great typefaces there that might fit what you are looking for. 

i would scratch your initial concepts due to the awkwardness and legibility issues. i am not opposed to the manipulation of the type, but if you're going to do it, have purpose behind it and make it appear logical, even though it's not. that's the beauty of ligatures.

best of luck.</div>
