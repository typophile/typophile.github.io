  \ Would love to use pragma ND but that is a bit pricey.  I own scala already and
  my client seemed to like that one.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Have you used
  this font for a book/catalogue before?  Any other recomendations (looking into Fedra
  Sans as well).\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think type should be chosen based on the subject matter. For example, Comic
    Sans wouldn't be appropriate for an architecture book. What is the style of the
    art? Can we see samples?

    feels different from the Serif. The sculptor's work seems like it would relate
    well. "
