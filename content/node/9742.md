  are many of these Anti-Drug ads so I imagine that it is actually a font and not
  hand-drawn.'

  body: 'I seem to recall that we may have had this question once before, but I hunted
    anyway. I searched all of <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 11</a> and <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script12Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 12</a> of the Script Font ID Guide. I found a number of very
    similar styles, but didn&#39;t see an exact match in over 500 samples. <BR> <BR>Now
    it&#39;s time for my &#39;standard&#39; reply about such questions:  basically,
    it is so simple and cheap to make a font like this, that any agency that wants
    a unique look, just needs a pen, a scanner or fax machine and a computer. For
    $9 you can send a sample of your printing and have a font made.   <BR> <BR>This
    means that looking to identically match fonts like this is generally a waste of
    time. You are better off to look through samples at any of the sites that have
    hand-printed fonts &#40;mine are samples only - no font downloads - you look up
    the source in my Reference List and get them from the supplier&#41;, and find
    something similar to the one you are trying to match.'
