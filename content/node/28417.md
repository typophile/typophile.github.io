  pays for a custom design, what are the type of licenses available in most cases?\r\n\r\nFor
  instance, I'm aware of:\r\n_ exclusive usage forever\r\n_ exclusive for X years\r\n_
  ...\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me on this issue?\r\n\r\nThx!"

    And the reason I think this seems to make sense is that the novelty of a new magazine
    or newspaper design or re-design is what counts most, and after that time the
    novelty is deemed to have expired. But of course not every custom job is tied
    to fashion, and in some cases perpetual exclusivity can make more sense.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing to consider is redistribution rights: the client of a custom font can purchase
    the rights to merely use it (and even only within a certain sphere, let's say
    its US operations) or it can purchase the rights to give it away or sell it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in some of these cases?"

  body: "Do you mean a totally non-exclusive license, such that the designer can immediately
    start selling the font via retail or even sell it as a custom font to another
    party? That seems like it would be rare - except maybe if the font's main purpose
    is to solve a particular technical issue, like maybe rendering on a certain low-res
    device.\r\n\r\nI suspect that in the case of a serious brand the client will want
    perpetual exclusivity, and probably even outright ownership: they would pay to
    have a font made for them, and then the designer is out of the picture... unless
    they need more Unicode coverage or better hinting or...  :-) In fact one thing
    the designer could do in such cases is stipulate that any future modification/extension
    has to be done by him (although it's hard to imagine an astute client accepting
    such a clause).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The type of license varies with each commission. It depends on the clients
    needs, and their budget. Custom work that is non-exclusive is priced lower than
    exclusive work. 2 to 3 year exclusive work is less costly they longer periods.
    Some clients prefer to pay a yearly fee to maintain their exclusivity.\r\n\r\nAs
    to price, discussing price in a forum such as this can bring the participants
    into some legal hot water, Price fixing, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    to get an idea on how much these things cost, why not begin by pricing enterprise
    licensing from various foundries. How much do they charge per font for a worldwide
    license? We all have those prices. Then, if you are going to spend that much money
    for a worldwide license for a font that already exists, and is in use by many,
    how much is a custom design going to be worth? At least as much as the enterprise
    solution, no? Most likely a little more.\r\n\r\nJames"

    commission type to actually save money?\r\nLike UPS did I belive (although that's

  body: Save money? I think it would be more like getting a solution and a license
    that fits their needs. Say Foundry X charges $10,000 per font for a worldwide
    license. Compay Z wants to license 4 fonts for a enterprise solution. Do they
    pay $40,000 for a four font family that exists and is being used by others, or
    do they pay a silmilar figure (maybe a little higher, maybe a little lower) for
    a custom solution?

  body: "James: what I was getting at is that if Company Z is big enough (in terms
    of number/geographic-range of computers needing the new font) the cost of a custom
    font even with perpetual exclusivity might be less than the cost of a worldwide
    license of a given existing font. And the fact that a \"cheap\" custom font tends
    to be inferior (except in its exclusivity) to high-quality existing fonts seems
    sadly lost on many clients.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think the length of exclusivity depends very much on the type of organisation
    you are doing the work for. Some, say publishers, may need only 2 years. Others,
    like global corporate entities may need much longer ones as implementation throughout
    the organisation alone can take a year or two. That, and given the fact that a
    rebrand is unlikely within 8 to 10 years means that they need longer exclusivity.\r\nAccordingly,
    you set your pricing.\r\n\r\nFor most corporates, the lure of a custom font is
    not about design (although it is part of the idea) but that it has logistic advantages.
    They are able to distribute these fonts from their brand site to all their suppliers
    without having to worry about extra licensing. This is probably one of the major
    factors why companies go for it. Ease of use!\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag
