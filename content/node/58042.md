body: "<strong>About the Company:</strong>\r\n\r\nSimplicious is improving the usability
  of software-applications and websites. Their goal is to design efficient and effective
  software to improve the user experience.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to keep it simple on
  the one hand and to keep a certain beauty in mind on the other hand.\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>Simplicious:</strong>
  Simply good, simply delectable, simply delicious. Like salt, use it sparingly to
  add a twinge of spice and sophistication to any conversation.</cite> (Urban Dictonary)\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Concept
  behind the logo:</strong>\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole logo the type gets a transformation
  from univers 55 to sabon roman. Univers with it's straight lines and the exceptional
  legibility represents the \"simple\"-factor. Sabon which looks like it has been
  designed with a wide-nib ink pen represents the \"delicious\"-factor.\r\n\r\nIn
  addition to make these two fonts work together, the x-height of the sabon has been
  adjusted. Only the first and the last \"s\" are set in their original typeface.
  All the rest has been done in FontLab Studio to create this illusion of morphing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  am really looking forward to reading your suggestions on it. (font-selection? typeface?
  kerning? appearance of the characters themeselves? ...)\r\nI would also appreciate
  your opinions on the company-name itself in connection with the branch. Is it a
  good idea to concentrate on typography to give it this touch of seriousness or might
  most of the people don't recognize the typographic effect and only be confused caused
  by the inconsistence of the logo?"

  body: "I think it's a good concept! In my opinion you could go much further to emphasize
    the \"morph.\" I'd like to see this with a swash or two; maybe try dividing the
    word more - \"Simpl\" and \"icious.\" Or even some italics or calligraphy for
    the \"icious\" side. Do it up, why not!\r\n\r\n/2 cents"

  body: "The morph from individual letter to individual letter is quite subtle causing
    some slightly awkward letterforms.\r\n\r\nWhat if the transition was a little
    more variegated...perhaps each syllable gets a transformation instead of each
    letter (or even each word part simp|licious).\r\n\r\nBut...I like what you have.
    Not sure if my suggestion would be an improvement or not...but maybes something
    to try for comparison. "

  body: I like the idea of splitting the word like that. It would be much more abrupt
    than the slow transition, but I think it will make the concept easier to grasp.
    Maybe even do a literal split like aluminum has in his comment. I keep seeing
    a swash coming from the bottom of the "c" and going forward; I'd mock something
    up if I had a minute, maybe later on today, don't wanna step on anyone's creative
    toes either.

  body: "Thank you very much for your critiques.\r\n\r\n<strong>to aluminum:</strong>
    I agree on your opinion about awkward letterforms. This subtle way of \"morphing\"
    the letters creates some diffusions, especially the \"plici\"-part has it's weaknesses.
    The reason why I decided to \"morph\" from letter to letter was that I wanted
    the finished logo to represent the word \"simplicious\" as a unit and not as two
    seperated parts. Do you think an abrupt change of the typeface after (or at) the
    \"l\" -- maybe by creating an unique \"l\" which keeps the two parts together
    -- and leaving the rest of the characters in their original typeface would work?\r\n\r\n<strong>to
    Coe:</strong> I absolutely second you. An abrupt change of the typeface would
    definitely make it easier to grasp the concept. I am really looking forward to
    seeing a mockup ... especially because of the swash you've mentioned."

    a better execution would help, but I think the concept is there. Maybe the c-swash
    works, maybe it doesn't (looking at it, I still think it could), but perhaps it'll
    give you an idea for a different one! Also, with such a change in style the bar
    probably isn't necessary.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Simplicious-swash_5069.jpg]"

  body: I would disagree with the direction of the abrupt typeface change. Based on
    your brief, this doesn't reinforce the name nor the concept of the company. I
    believe the concept can be done in it's original form, but maybe the typefaces
    are not the right fit for this particular process. I'd explore sticking to two
    of the same type of typefaces, instead of going from a sans-serif to a serif.
    You might want to play with the idea of taking one serif, and then create a metamorphosis
    into a more exaggerated serif typeface. I think that might help with the reduction
    of awkward letterforms.

    I still kind of like your idea with the swash and so I also tried to mock something
    up. But actually I am not sure about it either. In my opinion the bar causes a
    too strong separation of the two parts but anyway, thank you a lot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplicious_swash_6327.jpg]\r\n\r\n<strong>to
    imavery:</strong> Thank you for your constructive feedback. What would you think
    of starting the word in a modern serif and transform it into some kind of latin
    serif? Might that do the trick? Maybe end the word in a script typeface?"

  body: "Yeah, perhaps put the whole swash thing on the backburner...I'm looking at
    both our mock-ups and I think we're both getting too much of a negative space
    between the \"c\" and the \"i.\" I like the idea of a more exaggerated face. There
    have been some really awesome calligraphic open type fonts recently that feature
    lots of alternative glyphs and look just beautiful. Check this link \r\n\r\nhttp://new.typographica.org/2009/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2008/\r\n\r\nto
    see a couple of em. Also, some of the other fonts have really awesome italics
    that might be closer to what you're looking for. Again, these are just examples
    to get the ideas flowing."

  body: "Thank you a lot for your feedback and proposals.\r\n\r\nI agree on <strong>awkward
    letterforms</strong> as well as on <strong>too subtle to grasp</strong> and so
    I decided to think about the whole concept again. I once wrote that I like the
    morph because it represents the word \"simplicious\" as a whole without seperating
    the two parts of it too much. But after some kind of an \"internal monologue\"
    I realized that the word \"simplicious\" will alwyas be presented as a whole because
    of the fact it's the word that's written down and so <strong>the \"morph\" is
    too unspectacular</strong> too make an obvious distinction of the two parts.\r\n\r\nThat's
    about the time where all your feedback (also from other forums) came in and offered
    me some kind of playground to experiment with the concept.\r\n\r\nThe latest version
    again consists of <strong>Univers</strong> for the \"simple\"-part but this time
    I choose the <strong>65</strong> typeface. For the \"delicious\"-part I've tried
    some very different typefaces. I ended up with <strong>Bauer Bodoni</strong> which
    I'm very comfortable with. The italic typeface has such a <strong>nice rounding</strong>
    which -- in my opinion -- transports the content very well. This combination of
    a bold typeface and a regular italic one creates a nice distinction concerning
    the <strong>grey value </strong> which I really like a lot.\r\n\r\nAll in all
    the new version is more \"logo\" than the first one. It still works at very small
    sizes which was the major problem of the first version because of it's subtlety
    which was gone as soon as it was smaller. It only looked awkward because of the
    customized letters and their quality of execution which was far away from the
    quality of the original letterforms of Univers and Sabon.\r\n\r\nI hope you can
    give me such a <strong>constructive feedback</strong> on the new version as you
    have given me on the old one. I am really looking forward to your professional
    critiques.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uni-baubod_logo_5205.png]\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>p.s.</strong>
    I hope I got the kerning right. I'm not too sure about the \"ci\"\r\nand the \"ou\"
    but maybe you can help me with this.</cite>"

  body: I'm liking how this is looking! I think the change to Univers 65 was a smart
    move. Regarding the kerning, I think maybe the "ci" and "ou" might look sort of
    wide because the other letters are connected. If there is a subtle way to connect
    that "c" to the "i" and the "o" to the "u," perhaps that would help.

    make it look like the one of the following \"i\". But nevertheless I would have
    to reduce the distance which would make them a little too tight.\r\n\r\nAnnoyingly
    my laptop has just stoped working after the post and I'm a very infrequent \"safer\"
    which means that I have to rekern it. Nevertheless I will give it a try. Thank
    you a lot."
