body: "I am working on this logo, and I am having a bit of a hard time.  I looked
  at fonts for inspiration, and Alleghieri had some interesting swashes, that inspired
  the box look.  I used that font for the first three, but it looks too amateurish
  and dirty to me, especially for a photographer (since one would hope to convey crisp
  clean imagery).\r\n\r\nI still liked the idea of the \"L\" and \"k\" making a box,
  so I modified Bernhard Fashion.  I started to really like where it was going at
  that point.  This is a chronologically numbered grid of where I am currently at,
  with the last one being my final attempt thus far.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury,
  the client likes the first three, which I now can't stand.\r\n\r\nUgh.  Any helpful
  comments appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LS_Logo_5070.jpg]"

    below #'s 7,8,9. Any way you can go after a more photographic crop gesture with
    those? Maybe running the info side or bottom.  As they are I am seeing matting.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "I like it better. Maybe the L looks a bit like a T. Possibly do not cross
    them.\r\n\r\nNow, can you resolve the disparity in weight for me, no I am not
    the mean old art director, see if the same weight for the type works and reverse
    the colors. Or just pump the weight of ST DIOS.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?\r\n\r\nMichael"

    thier not supposed to do.\r\n\r\nSee if you can make that frame in a simpler way
    without distorting the letters\r\n\r\nfind fonts that naturally lend themselves
    to making that shape"

    the weight of the \"ST DIOS\".  I have tried two different placements for the
    orange crop mark, so let me know if you like either or neither.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo12-13_4295.jpg]"

  body: After you decide upon the final appearance of the logo, FontWorld (www.fontworld.com)
    has a service to convert the logo in a keystroke font, so the customer can simply
    type a keystroke to get the logo. This is called a "Font Logo". Prices are reasonable.
    Many well established companies use Font Logos. They sub-contract this service
    as well, so this can be another service that you can offer.

  body: sorry. i like number 2, with the kodak yellow box placement of number 3. the
    alluded dimensional boxes of 6-9 (and the subsequent uploads) don't say anything
    photographic to me, and seem a little forced.

  body: "-The first three are too sloppy. The font isn't right. The studios in number
    three I especially don't like. \r\n\r\n-I like the look of 7, 8 & 9. The box adds
    dimension and substance. The font you're currently using is very thin and cannot
    stand strongly alone. I don't like the join on the \"y\". It makes the font look
    too haphazard.\r\n\r\n-Forming the \"U\" in studios with the bottom of the \"k\"
    forces the type to do a little too much with itself (if you know what I mean).\r\n\r\n-I'm
    not sure putting the horizontal line of the \"L\" below everything (at least with
    the current font and setup) is working. It really just makes everything a little
    hard to read. It makes me focus more on the \"uck\" (which is probably not a good
    thing). \r\n\r\n-Have you thought about using a more substantial font? \r\n\r\n-I
    did a quick version in Helvetica that'll maybe give you more ideas about where
    to take this. I think you need to simplify and clean up what you're trying to
    do.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/luckey_02_4023.png]"

    that's not appropriate for this client, but they have a nice feel.\r\n\r\nYour
    second round works too, though there is the challenge that the 'L' become a bit
    lost."

    choose from those proposals you\xB4ve made but a logo is a problem of identity.
    The brand itself represents Luckey Studios, so this is some kint of restaurant
    or bakery?. \r\n\r\nSL"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo12-13_4295_6041.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou almost
    have it... the second one. Go back to the original k and soften up the \"frame\".
    Love it.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is a film/production studio, you'll want to loosen
    the lines creating the \"frame\" and let them appear as if you're creating a frame
    with your thumbs and forefingers. You know, like when a director/photographer
    walks into a space, and to get an idea of how to shoot it, they create a simple
    frame with their hands. Now I'm not suggesting you draw hands, just kind of hint
    to the curvature of the fingers on the inside of that makeshift frame then apply
    it to your current stiff frame. Subtle, but nuanced. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I have had an absolutely unruly week at work, and havent had a chance to
    go back to this.  However, there are some suggestions here that I really think
    work.  \r\n\r\nFirst, to elaborate, this logo is for a food and still-life photographer.
    \ Most of the people that he works with already know him through the absolutely
    horrible logo I made for him when I was a freshman in college (eek!)  so, this
    redesign is a pro-bono one to more or less clear my name.  Everyone has skeletons...\r\n\r\nSo,
    that said, it really isnt necissary for this logo to be incredibly static, and
    it could even benefit from some personality.  And for the record, the \"k decender
    as u\" was the client's idea, one that I did not agree with but attempted to make
    work.  However, after looking at it more, I am going to have to stand my ground.\r\n\r\nAsvetic,
    I really like your suggestions, and I will be reworking this over the weekend.
    \ I'll be sure to post updates!"
