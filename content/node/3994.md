  body: okay, I dont want to sound like a cheap bastard, but is there somehwhere that
    offers this font for free? I need to use this font ONCE for a one time only thing
    and then probably wont use it again... non-commercial

  body: I understand your dilemma, Corey. Unfortunately this is like  <BR>saying &#34;could
    I have Photoshop for free? I am not a designer and <BR>I&#39;ll only use it this
    once.&#34; In many ways, the production of fonts  <BR>depends on revenue to keep
    it alive.

    critique of Koch and of Kabel. He does think the Kabel e is not good - which is
    not in the title you cite.
