  body: "|pazinatto| appears to be Century Gothic:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic/\r\n\r\n|med|
    is not the same font. It appears to be a customize setting of Moiser (someone
    lopped off the stem of the |m|, or substituted an upside-down |w|):\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/moiser.font?text=med\r\n\r\nThe
    commercial license link for Moiser appears to be broken; Avant Garde Gothic would
    be a decent substitute (with the same editing to the |m|):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/"

  body: "Yes, nivara, I\u2019m aware of that. I gave you the closest match I could
    find, which based on your updated sample is still Moiser.\r\n\r\nMoiser is a 90%
    match, uploading your graphic into search engines such as Whatfontis and FindMyFont.
    Nothing else came as close.\r\n\r\nThe only vaguely similar, commercially available
    typeface I found was Arsinoe. While it\u2019s close to the overall form of your
    sample, it misses on several details (roundness of the |e| and |a| and the shape
    of the |r|):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pburgiel/arsinoe/\r\n\r\nIf you can
    provide more details about the source of your sample (date produced, country,
    whether it appeared in print or on the web), someone may be able to be more accurate. "

    sample is not unadulterated type.
