  normal  space with figurespace, especially as not all softwares can access it.\r\nBut
  I didn't find any mention of it here.\r\nAnyone do it already, or are there any
  good reasons to avoid it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nJan"

  body: That would make things like a column of phone numbers very gappy, as the figurespace
    is considerably wider than the space.

  body: "Yes it is. But for phone numbers you could also use a thinspace. \r\nThe
    problem is Apps like Photoshop can't access figurespace. Illustrator can but you
    have to open the glyphs window. It doesn't seem to handy.\r\nOn the other way,
    if an user forgets to deactivates tnum and keep writing, spaces will be huge..\r\nBut
    if we create a tnum version of monetary symbols, why not spaces too."

  body: "Font Bureau is in the habit of putting substitutions for additional tabular
    sorts, like figurespace and certain tabular punctuation, in a separate stylistic
    set so it can be \u2018added on\u2019 to {tnum} in situations that require. (And
    they\u2019ve settled on a standard of {ss20} across their fonts.)\r\n\r\nOf course,
    this doesn\u2019t make the figurespace any more accessible in Photoshop or Illustrator
    (which sounds like the original motive behind this thread) since these apps don\u2019t
    support ssets."

    to ssxx features in their Opentype panels (at least to v.cs4 which I use actually)
