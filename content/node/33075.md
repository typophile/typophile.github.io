  books in which the typography goes crazy.\r\nFor example. You have a normal written
  book an all of sudden the linespacing becomes double, triple or even more. You have
  just one word in a line or the typesize increases from 12pt to 300pt and so on.
  And maybe as suddenly as the typographic craziness began it  disappears again and
  the book goes on as if it were a totally normal novel. \r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\nWould
  be awesome.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nVit"

    typography (but also the writing and story). It's called <a href=\"http://www.onlyrevolutions.com\">Only
    Revolutions</a>.\r\nSome images <a href=\"http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/books/promos/a-plus/sam.large.gif\">here</a>

    But you need to hold the book to truely see all it's tricks. Really worth it,
    if only for the typography.\r\n\r\n"
