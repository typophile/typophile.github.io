  use Font Reserve, and strive to manage my &#40;assuredly too large&#41; font collection
  by running fonts through Font Doctor before adding them. Yet often the fonts go
  bad and I get &#34;Internal Runtime Error&#34; messages. I&#39;m trying to reload
  from the original font CDs, yet still this happens. Once good, obedient fonts are
  now seemingly useless. In the past couple of months I&#39;ve spent literally dozens
  of hours trying to solve this. I find Font Reserve to be slow and inefficient to
  work with. Fellow Mac/Pantherites: what are you using for Font Mangement Utility?
  Any tips on how to get this all to run more smoothly?'

  body: 'After fighting with Font Reserve for a few months, our publishing company
    switched to a manual font management system. <BR> <BR>Because our main apps are
    all from Adobe &#40;InD, PS, AI&#41;, we activate fonts by putting them in the
    Library : Application Support : Adobe : Fonts folder. <BR> <BR>We created an alias
    of this folder, named &#34;Active Fonts,&#34; and put it on the desktop to make
    adding and deleting fonts more convenient. Since OSX recognizes fonts within subfolders,
    we group all of the fonts required for a project into a single folder, and then
    add or remove it from the Active Fonts alias.  <BR> <BR>Using the Library : Application
    Support : Adobe : Fonts folder ensures that the fonts are available in our design
    apps, while not choking programs like Word and Entourage that don&#39;t like dealing
    with large numbers of open fonts. <BR> <BR>&#40;Another step that made life easier
    was eliminating the use of Multiple Master fonts, and replacing them with their
    OpenType equivalents.&#41;'

  body: I tried the solution listed above &#40;creating an alias of the Adobe:Fonts
    folder&#41;. I copied in a folder of 4 open type fonts, and then opened InDesign
    CS, but it couldn&#39;t see them. I then rebooted the machine, but it still couldn&#39;t
    see them. I opened them with Apple&#39;s FontBook, and they worked. I could see
    the fonts in the Library:Application Support:Adobe:Fonts folder. Is there a step
    I missed?
