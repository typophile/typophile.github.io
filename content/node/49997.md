  \xA7 glyphs .\r\n\r\nAre they cap height tall or descender tall?\r\n\r\nShould they
  be the same height as each other (disregarding any overshoot)?\r\n\r\nShould they
  both descend below the baseline or is that a bit old school?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any thoughts or can I basically do what I want?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNick.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    my ignorance if they don't belong in either."

  body: "In my experience, paragraph and section marks occur most commonly in conjunction
    with figures (in legal and scholarly references). As such, I design them to correspond
    to figure proportions and alignments. \r\n\r\nThe other common use for the paragraph
    mark is as a paragraph signifier in the middle of a solid block of text (or sometimes
    decoratively at the beginning). As such, it is usually followed by a capital letter.
    I generally design the paragraph mark to top align with cap height. But the bottom
    may descend.\r\n\r\nYou might look at these marks in other fonts that you admire
    to see how those who have come before have handled them.\r\n\r\n-- K."
