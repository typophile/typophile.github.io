    Square Sans Pro</a> by Parachute.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] It does seem to be customized
    somewhat, but I'm nearly positive that's the base font. [/EDIT]"

  body: "Wow, I don't really know what I was thinking. Yesterday, I would have sworn
    that PF Square was a near perfect match, but you're right Florian, it's totally
    different. There are only a few similarities.\r\n\r\nThose extra serifs on the
    M and N aren't a huge deal, that could easily be a customization, but the r, c,
    h and e really aren't that similar at all. That's a total fault on my part.. Back
    to the drawing board so to speak."

  body: There is some similarity to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_milo_ot_text/|FF
    Milo]] by Mike Abbink; especially in the w and S, but the g and the a are different.
    And the ends of all strokes seem rounded. But there is a kinship in the skeleton.
