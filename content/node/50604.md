  body: "I'm doing great! Back in Offenbach, for the moment at least\u2026\r\n\r\nThe
    Karstadt logo sure looks like Interstate to me\u2026\_here is a comparison image:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/karstadt-logo-maybe_4892.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    K and the S do look a little tweaked\u2026 especially the S!\r\n\r\nThey definitely
    use Interstate in some of their advertising and graphics (see http://www.fontblog.de/neue-karstadt-schrift-albertina
    \u2013 in German; the picture is in Albertina, but Interstate is mentioned in
    the text)"

  body: "I don't really see Interstate in the logo - the proportions are quite different,
    not just on the K and the S.\r\nIt almost looks like a mishmash of different sources,
    with the special K, s and low R. \r\nYou may want to take a look at Gotham Ultra
    and then start tweaking.\r\n\r\nCertainly a long way from the Karstadt I knew
    with back in Duesseldorf."
