  as my final year project at art school. This is the first of the project, a display
  face intended for posters, and other applications at 72pt and up. The form / style
  all comes from the initial inspiration with was a glyph for the birth sign Scorpio
  from a 1960s Astrology mag that caught my eye, also attached.\r\n\r\nEven though
  the character set is far from complete, I thought it better to get some input and
  advice sooner rather than later, as this is all a little new to me! Any help in
  already existing typefaces to research, or just general criticism of the letters
  so far would be really helpful and appreciated! \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSam\r\n\r\n"

    point:\r\n\r\nThe lowercase o looks too fat. The stroke needs thinned to look
    optically correct with other letters.\r\n\r\n "

  body: I suppose it's not really a Grotesk at all, perhaps just Zodiac will do (and
    be more correct).

    it could be wider also.\r\n/v/ - Might be too much like u\r\n/z/ - strokes look
    thin"

  body: "I like the overall idea and you got it working quite well, so far.\r\n\r\nYour
    q and g should be based on a turned around b, not d! Your K is slightly narrow.
    Some parts look a bit forced, like the l, t, e, f, etc. Try to keep all angled
    parts at the same angle. I don't know if it works, but you should at least try
    it. You could make some more space in the e, by making the cross-bar angled as
    well. Next time show off the font with some pangrams (http://dailypangram.tumblr.com/
    \r\nThey show how the different letters interact. Goodluck!\r\n\r\nJasper"

  body: "Very nice!  Since this is a display face, it might make sense to emphasize
    the unusual characteristics in as many letters as possidble.  The \"angled crossbar\"
    does not appear in every character it could---the N, S, and s appear to me to
    be obvious candidates.  Making the U have a tail similar to u would also allow
    the angled crossbar.\r\n"
