  body: "Well if you can't post an image, just say so.  It doesn't take any effort
    to explain that when you're posting at the time.  If you can't be bothered to
    do at least that, I can only assume it's just plain laziness.\r\n\r\nMy point
    stays the same despite your sarcactic remarks - people help each other out on
    these forums, and it's common courtesy everywhere (not just this forum) to show
    at least some appreciation for the people that take time out to look into questions
    in this forum.  The fact that I checked your post in the first place was to see
    if I could help, so in fact I was, as you say -'...spending your energy on these
    things...' - in order to initially help out.\r\n\r\nYour barbed remarks only show
    that you don't really appreciate the help offered you.  Miss Tiffany obviously
    doesn't let this kind of thing get to her, and I too usually let it go, but then
    I never claim to be perfect, just appreciative of the help given - check any of
    my posts.\r\n\r\nJH"
