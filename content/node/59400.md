  comparison between Google and traditional companies like Nickelodeon and Target
  (about halfway down the article) is good, I think.\r\n\r\nI have the feeling that,
  in the past, it used to be commonplace for large corporation to patronize the arts.
  By patronize, I mean pay artist, of course. Or, if not for big corporations, at
  least big, rich industrialists. But Google has more cash than all of these past
  institutions put together. They don't want to patronize the arts, but rather speak
  patronizingly to artists\u2026"

    have made tons while as many illustrators are still struggling to get the next
    jobs!\r\n\r\nI can identify with that because I used to do illustrations. In my
    country clients prefer stock photos than illustrations.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of similar
    with DRM. The big boys like Apple and Microsoft are applying DRM when they are
    already making billions. The font designers are the one who actually need DRM.
    People wrongly associate font design business (since it is kind of IT related)
    with these huge IT companies and they think that font designers are also making
    millions. \r\n\r\nWhen they protest against DRM, fonts designers become victims.\r\n\r\n"

    I can't be so forgiving. They are one of the richest companies in the world, but
    it is OK for them to act like corporate a$$holes, because they make OpenSource
    products. It is a double standard."

    if people wanted to contribute visual designs to an open source software project.\r\n\r\nThe
    article didn't mention that and somewhat lessons the comparisons they were using
    to Nickelodeon and Target. \r\n\r\nBut yea, it would have been nice (and smart,
    IMHO) to have actually commissioned artists."

    is totally OK, right? I mean it isn't like we should expect Google to make googles
    of more millions from this project? \r\n\r\nGoogle is saying, \"dear artists,
    you should work for free, so that our new cash cow can look even cooler on the
    market, and bring us even more eyeballs that we already get. We value the work
    we do, which is why we charge advertising fees to our clients, and why we pay
    our employees. But let's be honest, what you do isn't valuable, so just give us
    your stuff for free. I mean, it is open source, so you should be honored to be
    able to be so open about your work schedule and help us make more revenue!\""

    money, just the chance to get your work on telly. Ho hum'

    and there's a bit of a jump there. \r\n\r\nShould Google have commissioned artists
    instead of asking for free work? Yes.\r\n\r\nWas the comparison to Nickelodeon
