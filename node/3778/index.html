		<div class="commentbody">Nigel, you wrote that Linotype no longer delivers the Akzidenz Grotesk. That's right. But nowadays Linotype delivers 4 weights and 4 italics of the Basic Commercial typeface. If you look at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.linotype.com">www.linotype.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> you will be able to read the following sentence: &quot;Basic Commercial font is based on the design for Akzidenz Grotesk, which appeared with Berthold in 1900, designed by type setters whose names have not been recorded, but whose skill cannot be overlooked. This typeface has been popular among groups and movements so diverse as the Bauhaus, Dadaism, and the masters of Swiss typography. It served as an influence for a variety of newer, more anonymous grotesque fonts as well as Helvetica. Basic Commerical font is a clear and objective font whose forms exhibit almost nothing unusual, but which remains both lively and legible&quot;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basic Commercial is available in OpenType with the better hinting, But also in PS and TT for non-InDesign users.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->BasicCommercialBold<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->14056BasicCommBold.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (16.0 k)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;I think Agfa Monotype, Berthold, and Linotype are doing things the right way. Controlling their product&lt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've kept quiet for a long time, but now i have to clear up a few facts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Berthold Types in chicago is not the legal successor to H. Berthold AG <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Berthold Types has registered most of H. Berthold's trademarks and thus has every right to defend them <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original designers whose fonts are being sold today; thus effectively stealing from designers like Hans Reichel, who designed Barmeno but doesn't receive license payments for his design. Nor was he allowed to re-issue his own face as New Barmeno. So he had to call it Sari and redraw it extensively, just to be able to publish a typeface he licensed to H. Berthold AG, not Berthold Types (see 1).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Berthold Types sues everybody who only gets into the vicinity of one of their trademarks or even imagined marks, for example &quot;super&quot; or even &quot;grotesk&quot;. In these cases they just lost, finally. It is absurd to want to claim a trademark for a generic term like Grotesk, just because it occurs in one of their trademarks (Akzidenz Grotesk). Defending this not only cost countless hours but also tens of thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. They have been sueing dozens of people with frivolous cases. Failing to answer brings about a judgement in their favour; answering cost more money than all these small designers and foundries have. They win not by being right, but by default. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. They are bullies; it is not about trademarks but about deleting the competition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. I could cite many more (and worse) cases which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars (and i am not exaggerating), but this will probably already make me the target of the next attack. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8. This list doesn't discuss legal matters for their own sake. This list is not called legaphile; it is run by and for people who care for and live by typography.</div>
