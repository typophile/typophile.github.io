  body: "Regarding the arguments of the article defending the copy, type designers
    have been copying the work of those preceding them since the beginning of type.
    The article points out that many well known fonts are clearly derivatives of other
    fonts. There are no laws prohibiting that. One of the most used (and best done)
    fonts is Gotham. Tobias Frere-Jones copied the work of others from architectural
    signs to create that font. He didn\u2019t just sit down and sketch those shapes
    up from scratch. No one does. Everything with type is inspired by all of the type
    that\u2019s been done before. This is all talking about copying the shapes (which
    are fair game) and the discussion is not about copying the digital algorithms,
    or the font software files (which is illegal).\r\n\r\nIt seems in the article
    that Stephen Coles questioned the ethics in copying those shapes nearly verbatim.
    The ethics are questionable in virtually recreating an exact copy of the shapes,
    but since the digital outlines are clearly not the same (and in fact better) there
    is nothing illegal about the copy, which is why daFonts is able to share the font.\r\n\r\nI
    find Devroye\u2019s arguments to be solid. Maybe Stephen Coles, or others directly
    involved with the article, will speak up and expand on this."

    it, and produced an interpretation of the style, transposed from one medium to
    another. Duh.\r\n\r\nMost of my types are drawn from scratch.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nLittle
    Days is a total knock-off.\r\nIt's not exonerated by the existence of other, \"accepted\"
    knock-offs, as Luc argues.\r\n\r\nThe acceptable \"tolerance level\" varies with
    the genre of type.\r\nA subtle difference, globally applied in a face, can add
    new meaning and functionality in a much-populated, generic category.\r\nHowever,
    Little Days brings nothing new to the table in mimicking a face with a quite distinctive
    personality, despite some cosmetic camouflage.\r\n\r\nI will say that the tolerance
    level in the industry varies: certain large and powerful companies can get away
    with a lot more, without damaging their reputation, as can free-font plagiarists
    (not much reputation to be damaged), but the vast majority of foundries are straight
    shooters.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think it's a question of whether there is some benchmark
    level beyond which dubious behaviour will not be tolerated by \"the industry\"
    (even assuming unanimity were possible), but of what kind of companies a foundry
    wants to do business with (distributors are important!) and what kind of image
    it wants to have in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Please allow me to restate that Tobias Frere-Jones assimilated and transposed

    scratch entails deriving shapes from previous exposure. I'm not disputing your

  body: "@BlueStreak\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that you're trying to mix two things
    that can't be mixed: objective questions of what the law protects and subjective
    questions of what is \"original,\" \"fair game,\" \"plagiarism,\" etc. As applied
    to type design, these words have no intrinsic meaning.\r\n\r\nClearly it's true
    that the type industry thrives on reuse of ideas. Most of this reuse is legal;
    some is not. But every type designer has a different idea of the line that separates
    reasonable reuse from bad sportsmanship.\r\n\r\nComplicating the problem is that
    when type designers explain their ideas of reasonable reuse, sometimes they don't
    apply those ideas in a principled or consistent way. That has more to do with
    the fallibility of human reasoning than the difficulty of the question. \r\n\r\nIf
    I had to define my test for reasonable reuse it would probably be:\r\n\r\n1) Is
    the newer digital font necessarily derived from a specific older digital font?\r\n\r\n2)
    Does the newer font address a functional or market need that the older font does
    not, other than making the older font available for free?\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific
    examples:\r\n\r\nLittle Days & Memimas. 1) Little Days is necessarily derived
    from Memimas. 2) Little Days adds nothing to the world that Memimas hasn't already
    done, except to be available for free. Therefore, it may be legal, but it's not
    \u2014\_to me \u2014\_a reasonable reuse.\r\n\r\nGotham. 1) Gotham is derived
    from NYC signage. But not a specific font. So it's reasonable reuse. Some folks
    say they see a lot of similarity between Gotham and Proxima Nova. Maybe so. Often,
    good font ideas will emerge simultaneously without reference to each other. But
    Gotham has its own source material.\r\n\r\nI have a font called Alix. 1) It's
    based heavily on old IBM selectric fonts, specifically Prestige and Light Italic.
    While there are digital versions of these fonts, Alix is not based on those. So
    it's reasonable reuse. But it would also pass criterion 2): In terms of design,
    the current digital versions of Prestige are seriously inaccurate. Also, very
    few monospaced fonts have true italic styles, including the current Prestiges.
    So it adds functional value to what's already out there.\r\n"

    think about reasonable reuse of font ideas. You could fairly take the position
    that what the law does not prohibit, is permitted, and that in a free market,
    other considerations are irrelevant. \r\n\r\nThe answer is that type design is
    a very small world compared to most industries, even most design industries. Everyone
    involved professionally with type is in some sense an advocate for the whole industry.
    Most thoughtful type designers notice that in the long term, they have more to
    gain from good sportsmanship than from a slash-and-burn approach. One of the ways
    you earn respect for your own work is by showing that you respect others' work.\r\n\r\n"

    of a new generation. I think what\u2019s important about Gotham in this discussion
    isn\u2019t just Tobias Frere-Jones's masterful execution of the typeface, but
    of the font as well. \r\n\r\nThe topic here is perhaps specifically the font execution
    and not the appropriation of typefaces. I think Gotham is relevant to this discussion
    due to the masterful execution of the font, not the typeface. I think that Frere-Jone\u2019s
    contribution is perhaps more the masterful execution of the digital form of the
    type rather than the face of the type, (the proportions of the Gotham face are
    exceptional as well of course, but that\u2019s not the point). Considering the
    execution of the font as a significant reinterpretation leads back to the original
    issue; obviously the Little Days typeface is too similar Memimas to not have been
    directly derivative, but is the execution of the font a more masterful execution?
    I\u2019ve never seen digital forms of either font, but shouldn\u2019t that be
    a significant consideration?  If the Little Days font is superior to the Memimas
    font, wouldn\u2019t that make it worthy of being considered an original work?
    And I don\u2019t buy the prejudice that just because a font is on daFonts that
    it\u2019s inherently inferior to a font on the for sale market.\r\n\r\nPart of
    my problem in this discussion is the prejudice that lesser foundries are given.
    A subjective line of ethics is drawn by those in the type industry. It seems to
    me that Adobe, Bitstream, Linotype, Monotype and other \u201Crespected\u201D foundries
    get far less scrutiny of appropriating existing type than some of the lesser foundries.
    I\u2019m not at all talking about Gotham and H&FJ in this category as much as
    the examples listed in Devroye\u2019s article.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve entered a new
    era of not just type designers, but font designers as well. Most of the time they
    are one and the same, but that is not a given. At times, maybe like this topic,
    they have to be considered independently. And maybe someone like West Wind Fonts
    will get the same subjective consideration that a Hoefler & Frere-Jones receives.
    Once again, I think the Devroye\u2019s article makes a solid point."

    artwork is a \"derivative work\" of another artwork which <strong>is not</strong>
    in public domain, you must have a written agreement of its author.\r\nTo be in
    Public domain, a work must be \r\n1. released with a PD licence;\r\n2. 70 years

    to be taken by others, modified (even if improved) and resold? I don't think so.

    a copyright law that applies to works of art (but not fonts in the U.S. unfortunately)
    that states that if an artist doesn't change the work quite a bit it's copying.
    If I take a print of the Mona Lisa and paint a mustache on her, that's copying
    (and since it's a painting it's illegal for me to call it my own original work
    - this kind of thing is legal when done to fonts in America unfortunately). However
    if I paint lots of stuff all around her and cover a lot of the background and
    paint the mustache, I can probably prove to a jury that it's an original creation
    owned by me.\r\n\r\nSo if it REALLY looks like another font, it's copying, and
    though it may be legal in the U.S., I find it unethical.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the
    original font is rough looking in places and messed up in some places and you
    trace it but clean it up and make it look much better, maybe you should sell it
    under a different name, (if it's a marked improvement) as long as you admit what
    you've done and what font you traced if anyone asks you if you designed it. Because
    you didn't really design it, you copied and traced it. But then again maybe not

    Ethical, I guess so, but only on account of the fact that he wasn't mass producing
    and selling prints of these. From what I'm reading here I think he only made one
    copy and hung it up in museums/exhibitions. So that's the main difference between

    really weird that I gave that Mona Lisa mustache example off the top of my head.

    into all that Dada stuff; it's not my cup of tea, and this is an example of why
    it's not my cup of tea. Painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa and calling it art
    is preposterous in my opinion. It requires no talent whatsoever. And I would argue
    that if anyone likes it, what they really like about it is the Mona Lisa, and
    not the mustache. Kind of like when people tell me they like that song where puff

    \u2014 Just to be precise, with regard to your terminology, let me point out that
    *copyright* is a strictly legal precept. As such, it is subject to various laws,
    statutes, and jurisdictions, and it has evolved over time.\r\n\r\nThe legal concept
    of copyright did not exist in the 1500s. Modern copyright laws do not (and I don\u2019t
    believe ever have) actually pertain to a painting created in the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nDuchamp\u2019s
    <em>L.H.O.O.Q.</em> \u2014 despite whatever else one may wish to think about it
    \u2014 is not actually \u201Ca textbook copyright violation.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow,
    perhaps you meant to assert that Duchamp\u2019s action was an obvious example
    of *plagiarism.*\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll let you and Patrick (apetickler) debate that

    Duchamp did not actually copy the Mona Lisa. He purchased a readily available

    it, added the saucy caption, and hung it in a gallery.\r\n\r\nThis really is a
    bad example. But if you want textbook examples, then I recommend you find a textbook
    on copyright law. <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com\">Nolo Press</a> publishes some

    a more informed decision, one would have to research the specific copyright laws
    in France in the early 1900s. \r\n\r\nBut this Duchamp example is a red herring
    I think we should drop it now. It\u2019s just a distraction from the primary point

    everybody. Plus, there are few \"bright lines\", legally. Most works contain copyrightable
