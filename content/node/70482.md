body: Does anybody know if "Cyclone" font is available to freelance designers, quite
  costly to purchase considering the exchange rate between the dollar and rand here
  in Cape Town South Africa. Would appreciate any assistance to this regard!!!

  body: If I understand your inquiry correctly, you are asking if there is some way
    to get the Cyclone family without paying for it? Or am I misunderstanding?

    are doubtless ways you can get it illegally, but short of that, I don't know of
    anything. It's a retail, commercial font. You can always try contacting the vendor
    (Hoefler & Frere-Jones, contact info above) and see if they can do anything for
    you. Of course, a large portion of their clientele is freelance designers, so
    I don't immediately see why they would discount it for you.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
