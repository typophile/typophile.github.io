  body: I think Saul Bass wasn't participating in a much larger design/aesthetic trend
    as clearly as Mucha and Cassandre were, so there may not be an analogous label.
    For example, I can't think of buildings, or pieces of furniture, that match Bass's
    approach. (I don't just think it's the passage of less time that makes it more
    difficult to answer the question.)

    followed the modern period, i.e., from the 1950s until recently. The term implies
    a shift away from the formal rigors of the modernists, toward the less formally
    and emotionally stringent Pop artists, and other art movements which followed.
    By this definition, Saul Bass is decidedly postmodern.'

    the way that Great Man history works.\r\n\r\nBass was a modernist, working in
    the \"mid-century modern\" era.\r\nThe hand lettering he favored, contrasted against
    gridular layouts, can be compared to the texture of natural materials such as
    marble and wood in the architecture of Mies and Gropius.\r\nHis cartesian affair
    is clearly evident in the title sequence of NXNW.\r\nFilm is a grid, imposed on
    time, formalized like comic-book panels in story-boards.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how
    representative of their time type designers are, especially if their careers are
    long."

  body: "In art and industrial design, the Modern Age essentially celebrated the triumph
    of Industrial Capitalism; however, this triumph meant that the working man had
    become subservient to the machine, and not the reverse, as one would expect from
    a \"mechanical bride.\"  The rise of Trade Unionism during the 1930s was a direct
    response to this reversal of master-and-servant roles. Postmodernism got its name
    from the poet Charles Olson in 1949, but its genesis was in Hiroshima and Nagasaki:
    Everyman's very existence became suddenly very contingent upon terrible outside
    forces over which he exercised any real control (enter Camus, <em>et al.</em>).
    Thus, the postmodern outlook is, in a very real sense, atomized and post-apocalyptic.
    Saul Bass's work can be fairly characterized, stylistically, as post-apocalyptic
    graffiti; in other words, as utterly postmodern.\r\n"

    argument for Bass as a postmodernist. My understanding has always been that he
    is classified as a modernist from the New York School. But I was always very aware
    of how different American mid-century modernist graphic designed looked from its
    European counterpart. Compare Josef M\xFCller-Brockmann and Siegfried Odermatt's
    work to Alvin Lustig and Saul Bass's. Very different; still modern, just more
    American\u2014 a little more pragmatic, informal, and spontaneous. \r\n\r\nAfter
    seeing all the examples posted, I would say that Saul Bass's work looks much more
    like it embodies the end of american modernism rather than defining the start
    of postmodernism. Which I would say doesn't begin until the 1960's with Glaser,
    Chwast, Ruffins, and Sorel.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose that could continue the debate...\r\n\r\n"
