    just digitize it! Great design!"

    be made?\r\n\r\nThe \"o\" and the \"e\" for example, don't really fit in with
    the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks!"

  body: "Strengths:\r\n- somewhat gothic charm - reminds me of Edward Gorey\r\n- variation
    of treatment of bottoms of letters gives baseline energy\r\n- approximate consistency
    of diagonal lines ties letters together\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- unseriffed stroke
    of u looks odd to me.\r\n- the ornamentation (on b, g, f) isn't consistent in
    style and scale.\r\n- e and o don't fit (but you already knew that!). Try something
    narrower.\r\n- the s should be thickest in the middle\r\n- the jpg is too large!
    :-)"
