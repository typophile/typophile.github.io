  body: "Thanks fvilanakis. But, please let's not end the discussion at La Macchina,
    because that is actually a free-font based around their other logo. I think the
    main reason why I'm having trouble is because La Macchina comes up in every search\u2014like
    Loki Cola.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a professional project, so I'm looking for something
    more polished. Even if it's not quite the same\u2014something with a similar vibe
    that is more refined would be spectacular."

    target='_blank'>FF Tartine Script Black</a>.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I think that
    Ralph Unger's attribution of Alessandro Butti as the designer of Fluidum is correct
    and Monotype's attribution of Aldo Novarese incorrect."

  body: "Hi Mike, by coincidence I was researching the provenance of Fluidium a few
    days ago and came to the same conclusion. Note for example that Jaspert, in his
    _Type Encyclopedia [1970]_ states it is designed by A. Butti.\r\nDon"
