    Roman font, the Caledonia Arts &amp; Crafts font, plus several others. <BR> <BR>These
    new fonts also debut a redesign of our page which I think you&#39;ll find very

  body: 'I have recently added quite a lot of small booklets &#40;pdf-format&#41;
    at the Omnibus site, showing how my typefaces look in &#34;print&#34;. I have
    used fairy tales in different languages for the ones available &#40;in English,
    Esperanto and Swedish&#41;, and more will be added: in German, Italian &#40;Boccaccio&#39;s
    Decameron, one short story per booklet&#41;, French and Spanish, but it will take
    some time. <BR> <BR>Besides showing different typefaces, they can be good reading.
    The booklets can be downloaded at <A HREF="http://www.omnibus.se" TARGET="_top">www.omnibus.se</A>.'
