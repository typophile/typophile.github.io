  old point & shoot Samsung still does the job, but is starting to look very bulky
  and outdated.  \r\n\r\nSo i'm looking to get something new, i've got around \xA3250
  to spend, and want another point & shoot (I can't afford an SLR & would miss the
  convenience) but I want something with a little extra quality which really makes
  it stand out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at the new Panasonic Lumix
  DMC-TZ3EB-K http://www.panasonic.co.uk/high-zoom/dmc-tz3eb-k/index.htm which has
  a great 28mm lense and lots of features, but what would you spend your money on?
  thanks."

    use and they are great. Small - strong - and feature rich.

    moving. I also specifically chose a camera with the 28mm wide angle range; not
    all cameras have that. Olympus cameras have good color reproduction, which for
    me was an important factor. Some camera review websites have downloadable sample
    photos, which I would encourage you to download and take to your developer and
    then compare the prints rather than going mental over pixels on the screen. '

  body: "dpreview is great.\r\n\r\nI have had 4 digicams. First was a 3 MP Olympus
    which I just loved but it was bulky. Then I got a 4 MP Canon Elph which I didn't
    like because you couldn't set it so the flash was on off. It busted after 2 years.
    I currently have two. One is a Canon S80 which is a fantastic camera (and no longer
    available) but not that tiny. I brought it to the beach once however and a grain
    of sand lodged in the mech. The sand worked itself out (thank god) but as a result
    I ordered from eBay a used Panasonic/Leica 5 MP to toss around. It's a sweet little
    camera but no viewfinder and a grainy display (improved in the newer Panasonics).
    The pics are fine, but the display looks like they just enlarged a 2\" to 2.5\"
    without increasing the resolution.\r\n\r\nMy father has that 7MP Sony and it is
    a ridiculous camera - 4 clicks to delete a photo!\r\n\r\nProblem is, no camera
    yet has all the features I want in the right package. Anti-shake is very good,
    they all have big screens and at least 3x zoom. I think the lens is key, which
    is why I'd stick with Canon, Panasonic (Leica lens) or Sony (Zeiss). I don't think
    Nikons have anti-shake yet, and I think the Canon Elphs are much better now than
    they were when I had mine a few years ago. Touchscreen menus seems like a bad
    idea to me because of fingerprints on the display, but some people find the controls
    too small.\r\n\r\nOne of my beefs is that a lot of them don't have an optical
    viewfinder anymore. I still use that in bright light.\r\n\r\nSo... my advice is
    to isolate the two or three features most important to you - size, viewfinder,
    manual capabilities, aspect ratio, etc. Narrow down your search to a few, and
    then go mess around with them in a camera store. Definitely figure out how to
    delete a photo before you buy because you'll want to be able to do that easily.
    Also see how to switch modes. And the ability to view your pix without having
    to actually turn on the camera (and extend the lens) is nice. My Canon S80 has
    a separate button for that, it's not on the mode dial, I like that.\r\n\r\nAnother
    beef with the Elph I had was that the on/off button was right next to the shutter
    and I can't tell you how often I shut the camera off instead of taking a pic.
    Dunno if they've fixed that on the current Elphs."

    discontinued) a year ago and love it. Nice interface with my Mac, reasonably intuitive
    software, and the Basic manual will have you up and shooting within 15 minutes.
    \r\n\r\nThe only negative I can think of off-hand is that it doesn't take pictures
    in RAW format, but JPG.\r\n\r\n(edit: and one of the reasons I bought it was because
    it does have a real viewfinder.  I think only Canon still has them for point-and-shoots,
    but not on the ELPHs)"

    cameras and it is pretty much a free-flowing river. I went to a concert Sat. (Revent\xF3n

    the music's too loud, you're too old.\" and I got that confirmation Sat. Even
    with earplugs, it was deafening. I could feel my clothes rattling on my body as
    I got a full body massage by the bass and drums.\r\n\r\nBtw, another nice thing
    about that Lumix is the 28-280 equivelant. \r\n\r\nCanon's Powershot S3 IS has
    a 12X zoom but it starts at 35. To make up for this you can use their pictbridge
    software and combine a number of aligned photos. The camera helps you align them
    when using that mode. (This camera is big enough that you can't stick it in a
    pocket)"

    try the Sony''s which carry Zeiss optics or once again any of the low end Canons.
