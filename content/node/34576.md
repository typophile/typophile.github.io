  plans on server upgrades?"

  body: "Who is the administrator of this? AFAIK Typophile is taking donations, So
    I guess they could pay for better either server, either line or both. Depends
    what's causing the problem.\r\n\r\nAdministrators? Anybody here?\r\n\r\nIn the
    end it may be on the user experience wether someone likes a site or not. It may
    be so distracting (especially when getting timeouts) to users that they may just
    surf somewhere else.\r\n\r\nI like this site A LOT and I don't want it to reject
    members from participating because it's slow."

  body: "Indeed, we are experiencing some server issues, and we are looking into coming
    up with a solution. We also have thousands of users on the site at any given moment,
    unfortunately causing a bit of a lag, especially during high traffic hours (early
    morning and late afternoon, PST).\r\n\r\nWe will make an official announcement
    today, but Typophile will be coming offline tomorrow afternoon to implement some
    much needed system upgrades. \r\n"

  body: "We've had poor server performance as part of our \"free\" sponsored mediaTemple
    hosting service. Unfortunately, we've banged our collective head on the ceiling
    of server performance and storage space virtually since the beginning of our partnership
    arrangement. Requests to improve this have not yielded us an acceptable response,
    so we're in process of moving over to a paid hosting package to give us better
    server muscle and lots of server space for some cool new features we'd like to
    roll out.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Wednesday's maintenance upgrade will focus on
    Typophile's codebase, not on server platform, so this problem may persist for
    another few weeks. We find it incredibly frustrating too (remember, we're users
    too!) so please bear with us."
