  body: "Many thanks for your response.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one finds a 'snippet'
    of a word that looks interesting and needs help to identify the typeface, full
    words are not always available. I certainly didn't crop the image to 'obfuscate'
    the word. I assumed the point of this area of the forum was for the more learned
    members to try to use their knowledge to identify the typeface no matter how few
    the characters.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help I am given on here, but certainly
    don't appreciate your snooty response, I feel it is unnecessary, but thanks for
    your help all the same.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I feel compelled to support Nick. I disagree that his response was 'snooty',
    because I agree with his comment that we don't need to see just what the poster
    thinks are the 'interesting' letters \u2014 the more letters you can show us the
    better our chances of identifying the font. What we're trying to do here isn't
    a parlor trick to see how few letters it takes to make an ID.\r\n\r\nI looked
    at your sample too, and thought the 'a' resembled a display Caslon style. Sometimes
    there are swash letters, or alternative glyphs, such as that 'r', but seeing more
    letters would have been helpful, if you had them.\r\n\r\nWe all try to be helpful
    here, and some of us devote a lot of our time trying to answer many posts a day.
    We appreciate whatever posters can do to make it easier for us.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Many thanks for your response Mike.\r\n\r\nI completely understand and agree
    with what you say, it's just I didn't have a better crop, that was my point, and
    to be addressed like I was, where someone assumes I am trying to make things harder
    was un-called for I think. If I had a whole word I would have posted it. I certainly
    don't want to make things difficult for anyone!\r\n\r\nI appreciate anyone's help
    whenever I post, and am aware of the dedication to identifying typefaces and have
    always been not only grateful, but very impressed by peoples knowledge.\r\n\r\nAll
    the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n "
