  to illustrator from freehand MX but i'll get there - in at the deep end\r\n\r\ni
  consider myself a branding / logo expert - this is what i do best...\r\n\r\nmy customer
  imports high end large format printers and supplies for signwriting and billboards.\r\n\r\ni
  have thrown together 2 A4 pages to show the job progression... \r\n\r\nfirst page
  is overview of my initial presentation to the client... included for the younger
  designers here to see the \"concepts\"... there were equal number of concepts not
  presented to the client. as you can see i was hung up in the \"bubble jet\" dot
  concept for a while... then i moved on to \"slicker\" concepts...\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7148/6838521963_1bb318b3b3.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\ncustomer
  saw the white one reversed out of black and said it was good but needed further
  refinement... \r\n\r\nfeedback included\r\n-maybe it needed more blue\r\n-stencil
  font was ok to boss but 2ic hated it!\r\n-make more of a feature out of the EP cross
  bar thingy\r\n\r\nso here i am looking for external feedback...\r\n\r\nsome of the
  more experienced designers will pick up on what i have done with letter spacing,
  width etc...\r\n\r\n[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7154/6838520973_5e8b9fd66c.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nenjoy

  body: I am digging the dot-matrix style stuff, with the word print it just feels
    right. I especially like where you are going with the first group, second logo
    down from the top.

  body: I was drawn to the last group - Black with blue E-P gradient.  Nice clean,
    precise look.

  body: "Your refinements are going the wrong way. It's looking gimmicky\u2014like
    an beginner's attempt at geometric lettering\u2014especially characters 'E' and
    'B'.\r\n\r\nWhy highlight the connection between the 'E' and 'P'?"

  body: 'As an identity, it is almost impossible to evaluate without knowing more
    about the brief.  Who is the audience?  What are the kewords, messages, feelings,
    etc that need to be communicated?  It sounds like the feedback you got was about
    visual impact and not about concept and message.  Both are important, so don''t
    get sucked into just trying to make the name pretty.  The dot matrix concept says
    something more specific than the others, but to me it suggests an outdated and
    low resolution printing process.  You said ''high end'' so it seems that is a
    miss.  What ''high end'' means in this context could be ''hi tech'' or ''high
    fashion'' depending on the details of the audience and company, and each would
    yield very different results in the target message.  '
