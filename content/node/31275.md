  ARNOLD ~ Remembrances from four friends\r\n\r\nThursday, February 8, 2007\r\n\r\nMARIO
  GARCIA ~\r\n\r\nThe first book in the Bible of newspaper design\r\n\r\nLong before
  the term design was ever associated with newspapers, there was Ed Arnold.\r\n\r\nLong
  before there were Macs, or QuarkXPress, or SND, there was Ed Arnold.\r\n\r\nIn the
  book of newspaper design, Ed Arnold is the Genesis \u2013 the prologue to a rich
  story of how our craft developed. And the trailblazer \u2013 a lone, but resounding,
  and articulate, voice. I can't think of anyone else who could sit with a non-believing
  publisher and editor and convince them that packaging the news attractively was
  the key to getting readers to pay attention.\r\n\r\nHe set the stage for the rest
  of us in the same grand manner in which he did everything: a little bit of theater
  (no, make that a lot of theater), in which Ed, forever the star of whatever show
  he participated in, recited such  words as \"italics, picas, leading or Bodoni Bold\"
  in a sort of staccato rhythm while he paced the room, one finger up in the air,
  professorial, authoritative, the audience captivated, all eyes on his friendly face.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the Ed Arnold I remember, the one I discovered as a freshman in college, when
  I read \"Functional Newspaper Design\" \u2013 a book I confess I read in one night,
  as if it had been a Hemingway novel.  I remember that the next morning I was up
  early doing pencil sketches following his best axioms: \"Don't neglect the bottom
  right hand corner of the page,\" or \"Contrast is the key: Too much bold or too
  much light gets boring on the page.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did I know then that one day
  I would be the one to take his place (not that anyone ever could) at Syracuse University's
  S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications when he retired in 1977. Those were
  giant shoes to fill and I know that the same man who had inspired me as a college
  student continued to guide me as a young college professor.\r\n\r\nWe often met
  in the years that followed, and every time I learned something from Ed, like the
  time that we both coincided at an American Press Institute seminar, and I was experiencing
  trouble with a slide projector that would not work properly: \"Mario, it is better
  not to use audio visual aids,\" he said from the back of a room,  \"I decided years
  ago that it is best to just talk, hold your newspaper pages up in the air, and you
  play it safe.\"\r\n\r\nNot that he always played it safe himself: The Ed Arnold
  who designed newspapers around the globe was adventurous even in his travel preferences
  (Ed was in his 80s when I ran into him and he told me that he was working on a project
  in Ecuador, and traveling there on a cargo ship!).\r\n\r\nHe who had cut his teeth
  and worked most of his career with hot type, adapted quickly to the era of cold
  type, and wrote about it in one of his preeminent texts, \"Ink on Paper 2\" (1972).\r\n\r\nImagine
  what it took to move editors who loved vertical placement of text to consider  a
  more horizontal architecture on their pages, but Ed convinced them to do that in
  the late 1960s. Not to mention that just when  we thought \"dog legs\" (those twists
  and turns of type around unrelated stories) would be on newspaper pages forever,
  Ed designs The Christian Science Monitor following modular layout, and the world
  takes notice.\r\n\r\nWith modular layout, newspapers began to look more organized
  and less cluttered. With The National Observer, Ed not only brought modules starting
  from the first prototype, but introduced white space (gasp!) between unrelated stories.\r\n\r\nNever
  one to imitate magazines' design in his work, Ed nonetheless had an appreciation
  for the clean organizational elements that made magazines stand out and easier to
  read than the newspapers of his era, and he managed to create page architectures
  that, while maintaining  pure newspaper layout standards, also introduced the beginning
  of what I would call \"design\" into newspapers.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, Ed Arnold
  made our work easier. \r\n\r\nEvery week I remember something that Ed Arnold taught
  me.  Perhaps the most important thing he transmitted to me, and to thousands of
  his students, was the passion that he felt for our profession. It never left him.\r\n\r\nIn
  our last meeting, in Washington, he told me that he was doing a project a year,
  and he described his work to me in detail, with the same excitement that was there
  when I first had met him 32 years before.\r\n\r\nLong after his death, Ed Arnold
  will continue to influence what we do.\r\n\r\nNewspaper design has lost its first
  and only true guru.\r\n\r\n~ Mario Garcia is universally recognized as one of the
  news design industry's major voices. He is the founder and president of Garcia Media,
  and has more than 30 years of design experience, having redesigned more than 450
  newspapers worldwide \u2013 including The Wall Street Journal, Die Zeit (Germany),
  El Mercurio (Chile), El Tiempo (Bogota, Columbia), and The Philadelphia Inquirer."
