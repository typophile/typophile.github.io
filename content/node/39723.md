  body: "I just finished page design and layout on a book a month or two back in which
    I used Bembo for the main body text. The book is called <em>See Poverty ... Be
    the Difference.</em> It\u2019s a new printing of almost exactly the same book;
    and because there\u2019s no substantial change, they decided not to call it \u201C2nd
    edition\u201D. It should be heading to the printer any day now. It\u2019s to be
    published by the organization Communication Across Barriers, out of Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe
    original book, which may or may not still be available, is a spiral-bound affair
    that <em>does not</em> use Bembo; so you\u2019re not interested in that version.
    But the new is to be perfect-bound and, I said, should\u2014hopefully\u2014be
    going to press momentarily. The hold-up is a problem with some art throughout
    the book, which their printer tells them is \u201Ctoo dark.\u201D So they\u2019re
    having the artist who created all this art for the first book, and which they
    reused for the second, look into it."

    Adobe, complete with an Expert set, that I\u2019d had for years. I used it at
    11 point, on a 20% leading of 13.2 points. I like it\u2019s richness, particularly
    the Old style characteristic of a minimal contrast between thick and thin strokes,"

    Book,]] a new Bembo version by Robin Nicholas; it is based on a smaller metal
    master, so the x-height is smaller, but everything has been beefed up, so it's
    simultaneously more elegant and evocative of metal, and robust and clear. Very
    nice for offset."

  body: Yeah. I was wondering if anyone was using that or something else. Like I said,
    I just think it is too squat and spindly to work unless at a larger point size.
