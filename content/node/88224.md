  a font I found. I have attached an image and was wondering  if anyone could help
  by suggesting similar fonts, or even links to a full specimen. I haven't had much
  luck myself, but any knowledge of the font/foundry outside of my google searching
  would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThankyou!"

    if Phalanx never had an italic -and you plan on making one- this\r\nis a great

    don't hold the same appeal for me as my original find. Perhaps I'll try use another
    font as a basis and keep the thickened terminals. Thank you very much for the
    posts though, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nHrant: Sorry if this is a silly question,
    I'm still quite new to this. What do you mean by \"usable slanted-Roman faces\"?
    Which Roman faces are unusable? Is there an article/page you could point me towards?"

  body: "The typical Italic is closer to calligraphic forms than its associated Roman.\r\nMost
    people think this is a good thing, but to me it's just a legacy hold-over\r\nfrom
    less sophisticated times and makes no sense because an Italic is supposed\r\nto
    assist the Roman convey the text, not raise its voice in song!  :-)\r\n\r\nSo
    there's something called a slanted-Roman, which means an Italic that's\r\nquite
    close to the Roman in character, but slanted (although not mechanically).\r\nAround
    the turn of the century (the previous one :-) some French and German\r\nfoundries
    made amazing slanted-Roman fonts, but the world wars bombed them\r\ninto history.
    It's high time to bring them back. I try to do this in my own work,\r\nand some
    others have done this sort of thing too.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/59269\r\n\r\nTypophile
    is infested with my opinions on this :-) so you might take the time\r\nto do a
    search (just prefix your search with \"site:typophile.com\" on Google,\r\ndon't
    bother with the Typophile search box). Also, I gave a talk about this\r\nat TypeCon-LA
    in 2010, but I don't have it in a distributable form (yet).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, am I missing something in the online Ernestine specimens? I don't
    see a slanted-roman italic. The italic has a few serifs in placed where they don't
    occur in a cursive construction, but the letter shapes are mostly conventional
    italic, not roman. Actually, base on your previous comments regarding italic slant,
    I would have thought you might be critical of how upright the Ernestine italic
    is.\r\n\r\nI like it, by the way, and the Armenian too."

  body: "Sorry to be taking over this thread.\r\nJohn, I'm glad you like it. And surprised
    about your assessment of the Italic! When you speak of \xABconventional Italic\xBB
    letter shapes I assume you must be looking at things like the a and g? Which even
    in slanted-Roman italics are sometimes \xABswitched over\xBB to alternate structures,
    simply because the Roman ones tend not to work very well slanted (and, I guess,
    as an alternate means of differentiation). But if you look at the whole thing
    in terms of construction, they're interrupted (? not continuous) strokes, the
    curves are quite rigid, and rather than pen-reminiscent instrokes and outstrokes
    this one has flat serifs (ok, half ones) in the placement typical of a Roman;
    all characteristics that to me make it more of a slanted-Roman than a classic
    cursive-infused Italic. I'm curious to learn about alternate perspectives on this,
    also since I'm very much still learning to sort out concepts and terminology.\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    this thread might be a better place to continue the discussion; on p.2 there are
    some investigations into what makes italic lettershapes more or less cursive:
