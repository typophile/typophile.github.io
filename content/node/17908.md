  papers 6: a landmark publication\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth number of Typography papers
  is now published. This copiously illustrated book reconstructs the classical letter
  in the Italian renaissance and publishes some notable firsts.\r\n\r\nThese include
  the first full showing (and at same size) of the Newberry alphabet, a constructed
  manuscript alphabet of 29 capital letters made in Italy in the late fifteenth century
  and now in the Newberry Library, Chicago.\r\n\r\nAlso published for the first time
  is a posthumous essay by Nicolete Gray (d. 1997) introducing the Newberry alphabet
  and putting it in the context of a series of \u2018antique\u2019 alphabets constructed
  between 1464 and 1525.\r\n\r\nIn 1959 Giovanni Mardersteig, scholar-printer and
  founder of the Officina Bodoni in Verona, published a pioneering essay on Leon Batista
  Alberti\u2019s role in reviving the ancient Roman capitals. This much-cited work
  at last appears in English here in Typography papers, with its original illustrations,
  in James Mosley\u2019s translation.\r\n\r\nJames Mosley\u2019s incisive summary
  of the work of Giovan Francesco Cresci resumes work begun in the early 1960s with
  the publication of his seminal essay \u2018Trajan revived\u2019. Here Cresci\u2019s
  constitutional foundation of the baroque letter in Rome is illustrated, and \u2013
  another first \u2013 is complemented by pictorial comparisons of the great inscriptional
  alphabets published in Rome in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nPaul
  Stiff\u2019s survey of fifteenth-century Florentine inscriptional design starts
  with the epitaph to \u2018the great and ingenious\u2019 Brunelleschi, first architect
  of the renaissance, in the city\u2019s cathedral. His survey is illustrated by 90
  unpublished pictures from Reading\u2019s Lettering Collection, built up over the
  last 40 years.\r\n\r\n160 pages, many b/w pictures, paperback (sewn sections)\r\nISBN:

    printing exactly the right number of copies for future use. :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
