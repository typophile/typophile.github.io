  is a little tricky with no examples to follow. (If you're interested, you can read
  a little about the fictional history of the script and find a sample manuscript
  <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/lower_geldorian/672.html\">here</a>).\r\n\r\nI
  didn't know about OpenType when I designed this font, so the alternate letter forms
  are all just placed in different positions to be typed by the user.  I'd like to
  design an OpenType font to make the replacement automatic. Anyway, it's been a little
  while since I actually made this font, but I just recently found Typophile and thought
  I'd ask for opinions.<!--break-->  I'll explain the sample PDF (and GIF) so nobody
  will be confused.  It's contents are, from top to bottom:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Font Name
  (S\xEBftos Parathenia, in the S\xEBftos script)</li>\r\n<li>Three lines containing
  all the letters, with alternates</li>\r\n<li>Two lines with groups of similar letters</li>\r\n<li>A
  sample sentence</li>\r\n<li>Four columns containing a poem</li>\r\n<li>And finally,
  figures 0-9 at the very bottom</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    do it, but I've attached a GIF to my original post so you can get an idea of what
    it looks like (if a very vague one).  Should I try to remove and reattach the

    really not supposed to be that wide."

  body: "Thanks.  I did use some real scripts as examples in that I wanted this font
    to have the feel of uncial, with some black-letter qualities.\r\n\r\nEvery people
    using a particular script will develop guidelines describing what constitutes
    a well-formed letter, especially in relation to calligraphic styles like this.
    \ But, since this is an artificial script with no real history, I have to invent
    that myself.  And of course, It would hardly be authentic to emulate any one script
    entirely.\r\n\r\nWhat further complicates it is that even this style is a bit
    non-standard in the fictional world where it lives, but needs to still be readable
    by others while imparting it's character onto the area where it's used.\r\n\r\nMy
    main reason for posting here is that I think there are several forms that need
    adjustment, though they're hard to see in the GIF, unfortunately."

  body: "You seem to have three discernibly different weights here to reconcile. The
    round letters are heavier than everything else, and the fishhooks and descending
    mirror S are lighter. The latter is going to need some serifs or curls or something;
    look how solid that letter is in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nI understand why the letters
    with ascenders don't have a full x-height, but I think the \"n\" should grow to
    reach the x-height, because the \"nc\" ligatures look like they were made from
    two different sizes, like a 12pt fused to a 14pt."

  body: "The weight bothered me, too.  Some of the characters, like the mirrored S,
    were just never cleaned up because I wasn't sure about the way the shape came
    out.  I'll probably fix that by curling the ends and improving the stroke contrast.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also a bit worried about the letters resembling S turned on it's side.  Do these
    seem too wide?"

    Why not take some queues from other expression forms? Do you imaginary people

    interested to know how you have been thinking.\r\n\r\nWith what sorts or tools

  body: "Thanks for all your feedback!  I wrote up a great long message before and
    apparently pressed the wrong button, so I apologize if this is a bit short, or
    repeated, or anything else. I'll take everything in order.\r\n\r\nCerulean:  While
    they appear to be ligatures, and are in fact based on earlier ligatures, they're
    really distinct letters in this version of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nDan: I'll try
    to make sure I get them in the right place from now on, and thanks for the feature.
    That n-c ligature bothered me, too.  If you look closely, you can see that I already
    adjusted the n part it a bit, but I guess it still needs to go higher. I haven't
    had much time to work, though, so I don't have any new samples yet.\r\n\r\nMiss
    Tiffany: This font is pretty light for text sizes. I wonder how it would look
    in print. Anyway, I imagined the script being written with a broad pen, so it
    should probably be darker anyway.  It was for the same reason that I made it so
    sharp. But that was before I tried displaying it on my slightly fuzzy television
    (my computer was already connected anyway), and it looked absolutely beautiful!
    So I'll have to try that and see how it looks.  As for referring to letters, I
    considered posting all their \"native\" names, but I didn't want to confuse everybody.
    A reference to the closest Latin letter, or another descriptive term will suffice.\r\n\r\nDan:
    It was inspired a bit by Greek and Latin. I did an earlier font, which came out
    terrible (partially due to the software I used). That font (<a href=\"http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/9822005/\">here</a>)
    is much more like Latin, but with this one I'd like to create a design that would
    be more natural to the people writing it. They live in a fictional world, thoughThey
    would generally use pens (perhaps metal or read, probably not quill), though brushes
    could also used in some areas.  For another interpretation, see my mediocre calligraphy,
    with ample ligatures, alternate forms, and embellished names (also the source
    of my icon):\r\n<a href=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/afil.gif\">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/afil.gif</a>\r\nWhen
    I designed the script I was thinking of Insular miniscules (more like in the manuscript),
    but I just went in completely different directions with both fonts.  I'll have
    to try lettering this style more on paper to see if I can come up with any other
    ideas.\r\n\r\nPaul: I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke or not, but I
    like it! I will definitely try some things in that direction.  As it happens,
    the fictional people in question had earlier encounters with a race of giants
    whose writing is based more heavily on Tibetan, so that would make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for all the feedback.  I have many more ideas now to work with, so I'll
    start trying some things as soon as I get reunited with my calligraphy pen (been
    moving...)."

      not all\u2014see the last two in the following sample) of those letters without

      you can see, there's still the problem of inconsistent weights. However that
      got past me, I'll never know, but I guess fixing it is the next step. Since
      I have the work already started, I'd like to split this font into two weights.
      Then it's on to OpenType features. Here's to having a plan!"
