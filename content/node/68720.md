body: "I've been working on this font for about 5 months, and I figure it's about
  time to get some fresh eyes on it. It's designed to work at both text and display
  sizes -- my goal is for it to be bold and interesting at large sizes but be extremely
  legible at small sizes while taking up the least amount of room.\r\n\r\nI currently
  have seven different weights, though I am also planning on doing a set of obliques
  (I will probably do true italic characters as alternates, or vice-versa) as well
  as small caps/fractions/old-style figures/other OpenType features.\r\n\r\nLet me
  know what you think!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roster_3421.jpg]"

  body: "Nice work!  I particularly like the smooth curves and the ink traps.\r\n\r\nOne
    small thing that I noticed: the outside curve on the bottom of the upper bowl
    of the /g/ has a bump, particularly in the roman and medium weights.  The /g/
    in the heavier weights has some sharp turns just to the left of that place on
    the joining stem."

  body: Thanks to you both! I think I can see what you mean regarding the /g/ -- I'll
    smooth those out in the next version. I'll post something tomorrow or Friday with
    a new /g/ and any more tweaks.

  body: Any more thoughts on Roster? I have not updated the /g/ yet but if there are
    any other criticisms I'd like to address those too while I'm updating.

  body: "Pretty solid work. Maybe a little too DIN-esque.\r\n\r\n& seems a little
    unbalanced and thin on the crossbar.\r\nNumerals look big. 2 is a little too open
    in the lower right. 6 and 9 a little too closed."

  body: "Thanks riccard0! Interesting about the similarity to DIN...I was actually
    worried about it looking too much like Trade Gothic, but I will look into keeping
    it distinct from both. I really don't want to be known as the guy that makes rip-off
    fonts! After drawing both Roster and Normandie I noticed lots of similarities
    with other fonts, which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing but I do want to
    make them distinct with their own stand-out characteristics.\r\n\r\nI see what
    you mean about the numerals -- do you recommend making them narrower? Or smaller
    all-together? They line up with the caps height and while I know most fonts have
    slightly smaller numerals I figured it worked in this case.\r\n\r\nI'll keep going
    on these and hopefully have a new sample up in a week or so. I didn't have as
    much time to work on these this week as I would have liked."

    just a bit narrower could be better.\r\nBut, as you say, it depends on the intended
    use. I would advise you to compose some mock up of possible usage, print it out
    and see how it works."

  body: "The section marks seem to lean right, and the loop around @ needs some smoothing
    and perfecting. Are the quotation marks a touch light?\u2014not sure about that.\r\n\r\nI
    think /r/ may be too wide. /2/ certainly needs narrowing.\r\n\r\nI wonder if a
    curved bottom to /l/ like you have needs a little overshoot\u2014I've never thought
    of that before."
