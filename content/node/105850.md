body: "Hi, \r\nI was wondering if it is possible to create one new character in Font
  studio and save it the same way a newly created character would be saved in Private
  Character Editor. I mean, i dont want the newly created character assigned to any
  current letter, so the only way to use it would be to copy and paste it. \r\n\r\nMore
  detailed info on what i want to do:\r\nI want to create a few characters that each
  represents a word, like my own Chinese language based on English. But the problem
  when i try to do this in Font Studio is that i have to assign the it to a current
  character. So if i create a Chinese character for A and one for B etc. Than when
  i create that font and install it and use it, whenever i type A that Chinese character
  i design appear, but if i copy that Chinese character i designed and past it into
  notepad for example, than the letter A is displayed. But i want it still to display
  the Chinese Character. \r\n\r\nIf i on the other hand create a character in Private
  Character Editor and copy it, it will stay constant always. I want to do the same
  thing in Font Studio because the characters created in Font Studio look so much
  better.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if anyone could help me with this. "

    this would be possible as long as your font is installed at the system level on
    the relevant computer and is set to be the default font (where that is possible)
    in the applications you are using. As soon as you change to a different font the
    correct character for that code point will be displayed, so the behaviour you
    are hoping to see is dependent on how you set up the computer(s) on which the
    font is installed.\r\n\r\nIn general this is very bad practice for designing fonts
    and as soon as you introduce the font to different environments over which you
    have little or no control you will start to see unexpected and unpredictable results.
    If the character you are creating adheres to a Unicode code point then it should
    be assigned to that code point in order to display consistently, regardless of
    which application you are using. If you are creating Chinese characters then you
    will find fewer fonts (depending on the computer) that support it but it will
    be universally (and correctly) recognised."

  body: As far as I can tell, Private Character Editor maps its characters to code
    points in the Private Use Area. You could set up Fontlab Studio look and behave
    a bit more like PCE by toggling "Unicode ranges" mode in the Font window, then
    choosing "E000 Private Use Area" from the dropdown. (You can also assign Unicode
    values manually in the Glyph Properties box.) I don't know enough about PCE and
    its TTE files, Font Links, etc. to know if generating an ordinary font with PUA-encoded
    glyphs would yield the result you're after, but at least your custom characters
    would not be sharing Unicode values with existing characters.

  body: "Thanks very much for the replays. I will look in to toggling the \"Unicode
    ranges\". \r\n\r\nI my idea is not really to create Chinese characters or that
    the characters i am creating should be easily used by another system. I am trying
    to create one character that represents a whole word and than use AutoHotkey to
    display the character when i type that word. For ex. i type Performance  and it
    automatically change the set of letters in Performance to '\uE003', i know u cannot
    see this symbol bc i created it in PCE on my computer. But the dynamics of the
    symbol is the same, and as you can see, using this symbol instead of Performance
    saves a lot of space. \r\n\r\nThe problem with PCE is that i cannot back up the
    characters i make. But if i create the characters in FS and create a font from
    them than i could easily back up the project. The inconvenience is that i am creating
    a character on a place a normal letter is. So if i copy the newly created symbol
    to the AutoHotkey script, it will not show the symbol i created but the letter
    in its place. So. when writing in Word i would have to change the font to the
    one i created, only on that specific letter i want to be shown as a symbol. And
    doing this will make the easiness of it all pointless. \r\n\r\nBy the way, If
    anyone knows how to back up the characters created in PCE, please share this with
    me.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's been a while since I've had to deal with characters made with the Private
    Character Editor, but it was painful.  This software used to be known as EUDCEDIT,
    where eudc stands for \"end user defined characters,\" so you might try googling
    by that name.  Michael Kaplan has a [[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2010/01/22/9951970.aspx|2010
    blog post]] that lists the two files EUDCEDIT creates when used under WinXP, eudc.tte
    and eudc.euf, and mentions the difficulty of restoring the latter.  My recollection
    is that the practical way to \"liberate\" the bitmaps was by screen-grabs.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'd be really wary of relying on a word-processor's customized input routine tied
    to a custom version of a standard font that retains the orignal's name.  And while
    creating one's own Chinese input system might be fun, for serious use I'd rather
    learn one that has evolved through decades of use.  I like \u5009\u9821 (<em>cangjie</em>),
    though I gather \u4E94\u7B14 (<em>wubi</em>) is similar.  Having spent the time
    to learn <em>cangjie</em>, I can toggle that IME on with a key combination, press
    a few keys to get my character, and then toggle back to continue typing with regular
    keyboard input.  MS Word will automatically find a font for my character, even
    if it is a rare form up in Unicode's CJK Extension B (note that accessing Extension
    B  requires adjusting the IME's default settings).  And if I want to share my
    thoughts with others I don't have to print them out: anyone else can read my file
    with their system's standard software.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\nDavid"
