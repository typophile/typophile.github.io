body: "Hi everybody!\r\n\r\nSo... I'm currently developing a video game for this women's
  tackle football league, and wanted a font that had that blocky, authoritative look
  that you see on all the tv networks' NFL coverage... but I wanted something a little
  warm, too. (For lack of a better word, more <em>feminine</em>.)\r\n\r\nI couldn't
  find something, so last Saturday I started work on this.\r\n\r\nThe game is due
  out in four months, so I'm a bit pressed for time... I was wondering if anybody
  had comments. I think it looks a little too cartoony; it's supposed to look kind
  of elegant and sexy, yet blocky. Not sure what's going wrong there.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    might be better off going with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stainless">Stainless</a>
    or a customization thereof.

  body: "Hi Stephen! Great to hear from you.\r\n\r\nStainless looks really nice, especially
    the extended versions. I forgot to mention, yeah, I'm totally open to ditching
    my thing and going with something that's already out there, if I can embed it
    in a flash file.\r\n\r\n(Of course, my needs for a font are pretty limited right
    now; It will never be shown as big as my sample, I'd just use it for panel titles
    and menus and such, and it will never appear in print.)\r\n\r\nBut like most things
    I saw, Stainless is... a bit too sterile, I think? Severe? Having trouble articulating
    what I want here. Sort of something that's really classy like Aviano Sans, but
    with that sportsy, blocky look. Oh, and still casual somehow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm
    being too picky.\r\n\r\nI'd actually happily go with Aviano, but I can't possibly
    afford the embedding license, sadly."

  body: "Well, I kept looking for fonts... still didn't find anything I was completely
    happy with. So I thought I'd try cleaning this up a little.\r\n\r\nI've made the
    character widths a little more consistent, and fixed a few of the more awkward
    characters like s and k.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/springball2_3437.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    still needs work obviously, but I'm actually pretty happy so far. I think next
    I'll increase the weight overall a little, and make the stress on the ovals a
    bit more contrasty.\r\n\r\n(On a side note, I'd actually love the challenge of
    banging something out on a tight deadline, so for that reason alone, I'd like
    to continue working on this. I'll happily babble at the air here; it helps me
    think...)"

    everything heavier, tried to even out the color (is that the right word?) some
    more, and went out of my way to make things a little less symmetrical. I think
    that last one has helped a bit, though I'm still not thrilled with the r, b or
    k. Not sure what to do with those."

    latest. Been cleaning up the small caps more, trying to even out the widths of
    everything. And I've got a few large caps.\r\n\r\nThere are a few numbers too,
    but they're terribly rough right now.\r\n\r\nTo my eyes this is looking pretty
    good, but if that statement leaves any of you scratching your heads, I'd love
    to know. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The S looks haphazard in its distribution of curves and corners; it sort of
    brings the flavor of a weak autotrace to the whole face. Try for an S with more
    symmetry in it.

  body: "Ok, you asked more than once, so here's my two bits: you have a sound idea,
    but the execution doesn't look professional. The ideas are not consistently carried
    through--eg the tapered and bent verticals on the MN aren't followed elsewhere,
    and even the M and N are different treatments. The weight of the horizontals seem
    too heavy and clunky. Compare [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Armada/inuse|Armada]]
    by Tobias Frere-Jones for a balanced and polished execution of a related idea.
    Finally, the a lot of the curves are wonky, and the tail of the Q looks way out
    of place. \r\n "

  body: "Thanks for the detailed tips... I can really see what you mean about the
    inconsistencies and symmetry now.\r\n\r\nWilliam -- as for wonky curves, could
    you be more specific? I actually like the A, U, V, W and Y very much, but any
    of the round stuff is starting to look a bit strange now that you mention it.
    But I can't quite see what's wrong there. I'm thinking I should have the horizontals
    get a little thinner in the middle to match some of those verticals. I'd actually
    done that very early on, and abandoned it for some reason..."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4234.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's the
    latest.\r\n\r\nTotally re-did the S. The first one was supposed to be sort of
    stylishly asymmetric. Guess that wasn't working. So this is a little dull, perhaps,
    but at least seems like a better place to be working from.\r\n\r\nI changed the
    horizontal curves on the O, Q, U, C and G so they get a little thinner in the
    middle. I think that's helped a lot; thanks for mentioning that. Also made the
    C more balanced top-top-bottom. Again, it was supposed to add a little character
    having it top heavy, and I don't think it worked.\r\n\r\nAlso worked a little
    on the M and N. Still not thrilled with those; I'll have to have a closer look
    at them.\r\n\r\nI looked closely at Armada, and I think it's been helpful... I'm
    finding the curves on things like the lowercase p really interesting."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4759.jpg]\r\n\r\nI think I'm
    starting to get a better feel for this. But if I'm on the wrong track, could somebody
    please let me know?\r\n\r\nSo I'm trying to make this look more professional,
    more balanced. I thought I'd start by looking at the whitespace; people at TypeCon
    are always talking about that. But I've never really looked at it much.\r\n\r\nI
    started with a redesigned R, that I'm fairly happy with (though it appears to
    be falling forward or something now).\r\n\r\nMy normal instinct for the P then,
    would be to just remove the diagonal stroke on the R. But, without that there,
    the bottom of the bowl of the P doesn't feel balanced anymore; the diagonal was
    taking up some of that whitespace there. So I made the bowl a smidge taller.\r\n\r\nHaving
    done that, the bowl felt a smidge too big, compared to the R.. so I made it thinner,
    trying to make the whitespace in the bowls similar in area, if not in shape.\r\n\r\nWith
    that sort of logic in mind, I've increased the width of the E to make those counters
    match the R, and made the F a little thinner than the E, and moved the center
    bar down a tiny bit.\r\n\r\nOn to the horizontal bars on the A, E, B and F. I've
    made those thinner; if the height of the horizontal bar on the top or bottom of
    the E is a particular percentance of the cap height, I figured the height of the
    center bar should be the around same percentage of the height between the top
    of the bottom bar and the bottom of the top bar... so that visually, they look
    the same. Just a guess, but I think that's helped.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm babbling.
    There's also a more conservative Q now, and I fixed up the S so it looks a little
    more balanced.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Way better; you're starting to get your 'type eyes' :)\r\n\r\nThe key to
    making it better is to study a lot of other stuff in depth. \r\n\r\nYou can start
    with similar stuff. Armada is good, because it's Tobias Frere-Jones, who is one
    of the best, even though this is relatively early in his career. [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Clicker|Clicker]]--done
    for TV guide on the basis of the old TV screen shape--is another to look at. Also
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/eurostile/|Eurostile]].\r\n\r\nYou probably
    would find useful Karen Cheng's book Designing Type, which has a lot of comparisons
    between the widths and proportions of the caps. \r\n\r\nThe idea of something
    wide, a bit squarish rounds, and somewhat Albertus serifs is fresh, I think. But
    you need both more consistency and better proportions to make this sing. On proportions
    see Cheng's book. There are no hard and fast rules, but still that will educate
    your eye. On consistency, I think for example the S needs to be more 'cornered'
    to look consistent with the rest of the face. check Armada, Clicker and Eurostile.
    Now the S looks like it can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up :) The
    D also needs to relate to the O, and currently looks like its having a severe
    identify crisis. "

    studying Michelangelo, Beata, Eurostile and Microgramma pretty closely for this.
    That's been really helpful.\r\n\r\nHere are some disconnected notes...\r\n\r\n-Been
    working on the diagonals a bit. I think they're a bit more consistent now, though
    I'm still not happy with the K.\r\n-Made the tops of the B, R and P a little curved
    to counteract that leaning effect.\r\n-Staightened up the D.\r\n-Made the U thinner,
    but I think I overdid it.\r\n-Made the S a little more angular. I think I need
    to go farther with that.\r\n-Made lots of changes to the overshoots and width
    of various things, to get things looking more consistent. I'm trying to be less
    rigid about the numbers and just eyeball it."
