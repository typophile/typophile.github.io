  a design job another person started. He used KARTIKA font, which appears to have
  only one wheight it comes in?? \r\n\r\nIt seems to be a malaysian Font??? We're
  using it here for \"German/English\" text though.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm playing with
  the idea of replacing it. \r\nIs there e.g. any font it was modelled on? Is it a
  sceen font? (Font family?)\r\n\r\nHelvetica might do the job for example.\r\n\r\nThanks
  and cheers,\r\nzylvia"

  body: Kartika is a Malayalam (not Malaysian) font that ships with Windows. The Latin
    subset portion of the font is pretty similar in style to Helvetica and Arial,
    although the lowercase a leans more towards Univers.

  body: "Kartika intends to be a Malayalam font, but is n't as the shapes are very
    unlike any accepted letterforms in Malayalam. I am not sure if it works better
    as a Malaysian font! It is one of those Indic fonts which has been slapped on
    us by Microsoft typography as default, but works more as an insult to the language
    and script. When we Malayalis see it being used increasingly on blogs and sites,
    being the default Malayalam typeface, we shudder in disgust and self-pity. \r\n\r\nFortunately
    its Roman portion is better, being a mix of Akzidenz Grotesk, Helvetica, Univers,
    Arial, Verdana etc. Using any of these is however a better idea that support this
    unwanted remix of dubious origins."

  body: The latin portion of the Windows Indic UI fonts are lifted from "Microsoft
    Sans Serif" which is the outline verison of the "MS Sans" Windows 3.0 era bitmap
    font, which was originally named "Helv". Helv was based on bitmaps licensed from
    Bitstream but hand modified by a former Microsoft engineer who is now the minority
    owner of the Seattle Mariners baseball club. Hope this helps. Any other questions?

  body: I should add that these Indic UI fonts didn't originally contain Latin coverage,
    the space would have been defined as part of the original character set.
