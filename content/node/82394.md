  generating the font and using it in InDesign CS3, Windows for testing. Everything
  has been going well until yesterday when InDesign started locking up while trying
  to output a PDF with the font. InDesign also cannot display the font in its glyph
  pallet. Again, it locks up.\r\n\r\nI have Roman, Italic, Bold and BoldItalic fonts.
  Roman and Italic have the problem, Bold and BoldItalic do NOT! Compared to other
  professional fonts there is little by way of features and classes and I've tried
  deleting all the classes and features and copying them from one of the fonts that
  works.\r\n\r\nI've narrowed the problem down the small caps, I think. When I set
  a single line of type in InDesign it will PDF. Turn the small caps on for even a
  single character and InDesign locks up trying to export a PDF. I'm suspecting the
  glyph pallet won't display because it also would have to access the small caps.\r\n\r\nI
  know there is little to on here as far as problem solving info, but I'm hoping someone
  as seen this issue with InDesign and can give me something else at which to look.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen\r\n"

    had a bunch of versions of the font most likely, and it's possible the cache is
    confused about something important.\r\n\r\nFailing that... darned if I know. I'd
    be willing to take a look at the font and see if there is an obvious issue of
    some sort.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks very much David. I discovered those files on my own a year or so ago,
    didn't realize they were considered the font cache. Just knew they were very annoying
    while testing fonts. :o)\r\n\r\nI tried deleting them but to no avail, still locking
    up InD. I'm going to try a different machine when I get to work in the morning.\r\n\r\nOn
    thing I did confirm since my last post is that it definitely seems to have something
    to do with the small cap feature / classes. If I simply remove the small cap feature
    (leaving the classes) it works. I don't get my small cap glyphs but InD does create
    a PDF.\r\n\r\nIf I can't figure out whassup tomorrow the rotary oscillator is
    going to start becoming covered in defecation so I may take T up on his offer
    and have him take a look.\r\n\r\nThanks again to all. I'll be sure to post if
    I find the problem.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKen"

    the font and had renamed some glyphs. Earlier on in the development of the font
    I THOUGHT I saw InDesign have some trouble at one point after having renamed a
    glyph but I couldn't see how that could be.\r\n\r\nJust more food for thought.\r\n\r\nKen"

    theory. Tried to use the font on a machine that had never before run CS3 to no
    avail. Same issues.\r\n\r\nOn another forum I received a reply that someone saw
    strangeness in InDesign, though not specifically what I'm seeing, that he found
    was related to an error in the OTF language processing in CS3, fixed in CS4. So
    I'm now looking at the language stuff, though I don't see anything right off.\r\n\r\nOy.\r\n"

  body: "OK, fixed the problem but haven\u2019t solved the mystery.\r\n\r\nThe font
    has a rather large liga feature designed to be used for keyboarding of multiple
    Greek accents. One of the last things I did was to re-encode a glyph from the
    private use area to the Unicode standard. Trouble was, I didn\u2019t update the
    liga feature with the new glyph\u2019s name, so InD couldn\u2019t resolve the
    liga substitution to a glyph that wasn\u2019t there.\r\n\r\nCuriously, CS5 was
    able to resolve, probably more like ignore the issue.\r\n\r\nWhat was so perplexing
    is that I kept comparing the features and classes of fonts in the family that
    worked, and those that didn\u2019t and they were identical. So, the mystery still
    remains as to why two of the fonts worked and two didn\u2019t even though they
    all had the same liga feature with the error in it. And also why it would PDF
    from InD without small caps in the file, but not with small caps.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
    set the bummed out FontLab files aside, maybe if I see something along the way
    I\u2019ll go back and try and solve the last mystery.\r\n\r\nThanks again for
    everyone\u2019s help!\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nKen\r\n"
