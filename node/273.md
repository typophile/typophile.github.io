body: I&#39;m going in for an interview at P22 to possibly get an internship. I was
  wondering if you guys think I should include these two unfinished fonts in my portfolio.
  Also feel free to critique them as well. Thanks. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11347.gif"

  body: Hi, <BR>When I interview people, I see nothing wrong with unfinished work
    in a portfolio. If nothing else it shows that you&#39;re active. Refer to it as
    work in progress though, as &#39;unfinished&#39; could give the wrong impression
    that you started the work, but couldn&#39;t be arsed to finish it. <BR> <BR>BTW
    I don&#39;t know the people at P22, but when I&#39;ve dealt with them, they seem
    laid back enough not to be anal about things like this. <BR> <BR>As for the fonts,
    I like the first one a lot - maybe the lc a looks a little out of place.

  body: Thanks Steve.  <BR>Yeah I guess presentation is everything when your in an
    interview so calling it unfinished wouldn&#39;t be so smart. Now that i&#39;ve
    had some time to think about it i&#39;m probably not going to put the second one
    in. I haven&#39;t really worked on it that long and it&#39;s a little too generic.  <BR>Also,
    I can see what you mean about the lc a. If i ended up changing it should i also
    change the e?

  body: '&#62;&#62;If i ended up changing it should i also change the e? <BR> <BR>Maybe,
    I think both the &#39;a&#39; and the &#39;e&#39; &#40;and maybe even the &#39;g&#39;&#41;
    suggest a slight pause and change of direction in the penstroke, which seems out
    of place in this font <BR>I like the bowls of the lc &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;
    &amp; &#39;d&#39; more <BR> <BR>Also the lc &#39;a&#39; may benefit from a tail
    - does it look a bit too futuristic for the rest of the font? <BR>'

  body: Well, I got the internship &#40;which looks like it&#39;s going to be great&#41;,
    so now maybe I&#39;ll have time to work on this again.  <BR> <BR>I also found
    out that Rich Kegler sometimes posts here so... Rich if your reading this AVERT
    YOUR EYES! <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;Also the lc &#39;a&#39; may benefit from a tail  <BR>
    <BR>I see what you mean, compared to the &#34;e&#34; it looks a little off balance.
    I&#39;m going to work on this tomorrow and friday so i&#39;ll do some revisions
    and post them. Thanks again.
