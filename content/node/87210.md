  body: "simply use the \"save for web\" function at 50x50px. Don't just use \"save
    as... jpg\" as this will add all sort of superfluousness (meta data etc).\r\n\r\n

  body: I can get the image to size. Now the website just doesn't seem to be taking
    kindly to my uploads. I save the 60x60 jpg for web and the file comes out to be
    3kb. I upload it to my profile and press save. The site refreshes and it still
    says that there are no images uploaded...
