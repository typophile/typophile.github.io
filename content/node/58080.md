body: Every so often I find I can't seem to control the editing layers palette. I
  keep "auto select layers"unchecked so that I don't accidentally grab a metrics line.
  Today even though I had this unchecked it would still allow my cursor to select
  metrics. I expanded the panel and hit the lock on horizontal metrics and that stopped
  auto selecting. Then I tried the same with vertical metrics, but it still allows
  auto selecting even when locked. Is there a fix for this or am I dealing with a
  bug in the program?

    was moving. In actuality the alignment zones (not currently set properly) were
    visible and it was that I mistakenly moved. Still\u2026 it seems as though the
    auto select button doesn't work properly."

    are dealing with unusually executed/maintained layers architecture. \r\nThe Outline
    layer does not behave correctly, not e.g. responding to a user's desire for it's
    disappearance.\r\nThe Background layer editing is controlled from a menu pick
    in the tools window. \r\nThe Glyph metrics are not easily locked and unlocked,
    causing sometimes disaster-like unwanted movement of the origin line, something
    I've have never ever wanted to move, But in order to have the right side bearing
    free to move at any time...\r\nAnd this all happens in an environment where the
    cmmd key is so over-dedicated, one seldom has the proper tool at the end of the
    cursor without extra effort, and without the right cursor the arrow keys and mouse
    do not react properly when working on any layer. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    James. \r\n\r\nI ended up using a combination of the expanded layers menu and
    above menus. It was helpful in some ways because I had never made so that it required
    a key command to select the background before. That makes my work much easier
    not having to double click it back off all the time. I'm so used to using a wacom
    tablet which is way over-sensitive for FontLab.\r\n\r\nStephen"
