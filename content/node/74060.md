  body: "If you\u2019re doing something that is supposed to feel randomized/varied
    (as in handwriting), the correct feature would be contextual alternates. If not,
    consider stylistic sets or stylistic alternates (maybe doubled in titling alternates
    depending on the intended application support). "

  body: "Thanks, Frank. But, look, I create the follow codelines:\r\n\r\nfeature ss01
    { # Sylistic Set 1\r\n # Latin\r\n    sub A by A_ss01;\r\n    sub & by &_ss01;\r\n}
    ss01;\r\n\r\nand, when compiled, I get the follow message:\r\n\r\n[FATAL] <Penabico>
    invalid token (text was \"&\") [C:/Users/Paulo W/Documents/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea
    2410]\r\n\r\nSo, dont work - or I am making another mistake. I prefer Stylistic
    Sets, because the user can choice the better character for your layout. Using
    Stylistic Alternates I think I will nmot have resources to show all the \"ampersand\"
    variations whic I create."

  body: 'You could also have more than one feature containing the ampersands, by using
    the Ornaments feature as well: that way, all the ampersands will be visible together
    in the glyph palette.'

  body: "I would use the \"stylistic alternates\" ('salt') feature.\r\n\r\nAs a side
    note, your glyph naming is incorrect, unless you're doing ligatures. You should
    use a period where you currently have an underscore.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Thanks, Phinney, by the side note. But, unfortunately, it's too late. I did
    make the programation on over 1000 gliphs ! I still learning open type procedures
    and features. And the language (I speak portuguese, self-taught) sometimes is
    a problem. I will take in mind this in the next font.
