  results I get are much less than usual, and when I restrict my search to typophile.com,
  I get results from weird subdomains such as mail.www.typophile.com, dev.typophile.com,
  rainbowsnot.typophile.com or www.sports3.blog.typophile.com\r\n\r\nWhat's up?"

    and it\u2019s getting worse with time."

    (http://duckduckgo.com) for that matter.\r\nBut that wouldn't really solve the
    problem, would it?"

  body: "<blockquote>what\u2019s the biggie</blockquote>\r\nIn the short run the inability
    to access and refer to the treasure trove of knowledge of past threads.\r\nIn
    the medium run the drastic reduction of visitors and new non-spammers, non-type-id-board
    users (thus of Typophile\u2019s appeal to possible advertisers).\r\nIn the long
    run, the irrelevance of Typophile."

    Bing should\u2019ve updated its indexes, because now it cannot find anything too."

    I hope this gets corrected soon,

  body: "So the weird urls are because there is an open wildcard dns entry on typophile.com
    (http://ma.tt/2003/10/wildcard-dns-and-sub-domains/ if you geek out on internet
    routing and dns, not jut type ;). What is worrisome is that they don't have a
    canonical url setup so if google indexes any other weird domains then they will
    be seen as duplicate content which will tank rankings.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be
    difficult to fix. If a site admin sees this feel free to get in touch."
