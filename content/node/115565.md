  body: "Can't recognize this one and can't get my hand on the previous discussion
    for 'LIQUIGAS' (but actually is not important as I perfectly remember it was not
    identified)... Can't also state if it's totally hand-done or customization of
    a commercial font (from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile|Eurostile]]??!!
    Like manually rounding by adding an outline stroke, reworking /Q tail and slanting
    it).\r\nSome alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/fono|Fono]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic|Dharma Gothic]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pagan-sharp/malleable-grotesque|Malleable
    Grotesque]], <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque|Geogrotesque]]</strong>
    (my best pick, design far better than the original to me), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/from-the-stars|From
    The Stars]] (mainly reworking /L corner and /Q tail), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/geom-graphic|Geom
    Graphic]] (nice one but width and /S off), <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/signal/center|Center]]</strong>
    (very good one as well), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/rbno2-1|RBNo2.1]]
