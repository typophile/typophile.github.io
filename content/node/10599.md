  usually avoid these things. I know people who love them, who go out specifically
  to visit them, who will drive all over town every Saturday looking for &#39;treasures&#39;,
  who make note of dates and times posted on lamp posts, etc. And I&#39;m sure that
  their diligence means that they do, indeed, find wonderful things at little cost,
  perhaps often. As I say, I generally avoid them because I&#39;m mainly interested
  in books and I hate digging through boxes of dross hoping to find something desirable
  or rare or valuable or even readable. I&#39;d rather wait for such a book to make
  its way up the bibliophilic food chain -- scout &#62; general bookseller &#62; specialist
  bookseller --, partly because I&#39;m lazy and dislike spending hours digging through
  charity shop bins, stacks of old <i>National Geographic</i> magazines, etc. looking
  for something worth buying, and partly because having worked in the trade I know
  that I would be cutting in on some scout&#39;s territory. <BR> <BR>Last Saturday,
  though, the sun was bright, the weather warm, and the first weekend of the yard
  sale season brought out dozens of sellers along the sidewalks of Vancouver&#39;s
  West End. I was walking out to pick up my dry cleaning, and something about a particular
  yard sale -- its size, the quantity of stuff on offer, perhaps -- drew my attention,
  and I surprised myself by taking a detour to visit it. And look what I found: <BR>
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70949.jpg" alt="Sheila
  Waters print"> <BR> <BR>A signed limited edition print of calligraphy by Sheila
  Waters. It needs reframing, but I&#39;m quite chuffed, even if it did cost more
  than I would have considered a bargain. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not inspired to change
  my yard sale-avoiding ways, but I am left wondering what typographic, calligraphic
  or other lettering treasures my typophile comrades might have turned up at such
  events?'

  body: 'Wow, what a wonderful discovery! <BR> <BR>Last summer in San Francisco, I
    came across a typographic treat at a sidewalk/garage sale on Haight street. Nothing
    to be treasured, but a pretty good collection of books from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s
    on lettering for reproduction and calligraphy. I also came across a well kept
    copy of About Face. These and many others only cost me a dollar per book. <i>I
    promise, they followed me home! They wanted a nice place to live!</i> <BR> <BR>I
    nearly forgot '

  body: For my birthday a couple of years ago, two of my good friends bought me a
    cast iron corn-pone &#40;or cookie&#41; pan. But instead of the standard hillbilly
    corn-pone recesses, it has the alphabet made of animals and what-not. Must have
    cost them about 25 cents at Swap-O-Rama on South Ashland in Chicago. I don&#39;t
    have it in the office or I&#39;d post a photo. Makes hella good cornbread, incidentally.
