  I was standing 3 feet away from it, I couldn't read it. When I stepped back a bit,
  I glimpsed this little fellow:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_6660.JPG]\r\n\r\nThe
  letterspacing is hugemungously wide, too the point that I couldn't read it on the
  fence I was walking by. (Interesting name, considering the topic though...)\r\n\r\nIs
  there any kind of rule, other than the Mach 1 Eyeball, for how wide is too wide?
  I mean, seriously, an EM space is too much.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    really want to be able to read it. For someone driving by, at a distance, this
    wouldn't appear near as wide as it did to you. \r\n\r\n(edit: I said \"aren't\",
    but I meant \"are\".)"

    small anyways, wouldn't it?

  body: "I'm thinking it is like watching a TV that is set up for HD, but the television
    show itself doesn't fit the ratio so you stretch it to fit. But, then you watch
    the TV from an angle, say from the kitchen, and the perspective is corrected.
    Someone driving past won't ever see it from straight on so the spacing won't be
    as wide.\r\n\r\nAnyway, at face value the spacing is too wide. Another example
    of something being designed without be tested in the environment or at final sizes.
    IMHO"

    you to slow down your reading speed, so you pay attention and then think about
    it later, they've succeeded.\r\n\r\n... It does looks like proportionally distorted
    letters!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nBy God, Chris, if you're right I'll NEVER buy a condo
    from those people!.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    this was designed, based on the angle of view from the road from a stop sign or
    something. From a sharp angle extended characters and wide letterspacing will
    look more natural."
