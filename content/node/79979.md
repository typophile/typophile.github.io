  anyone provide me with some info on this? Once i've finished my font, where do i
  go from there? How does one go about making money on a font? Lastly, are there any
  recommended applications to use aside from illustrator?\r\n\r\nAny help would be
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-nick"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\nCreating a type face is a question of just doing it - in my case
    anyway, I'm an amateur myself. I used to design type in Illustrator too, but found
    that creating it in FontLab Studio makes it a lot easier. Things like spacing
    and kerning can be instantly created, viewed and modified where as in Illustrator
    you can only draw. Making money on a font is not easy I gather. You'll put many
    an hour into the design, so if you're thinking you can get paid for that time
    you spend on it, you can forget it ;-) Exceptions aside of course. You might consider
    puttting your font up for sale at sites like myfonts.com.\r\nBut, first of all,
    we would really like to see your design so we might help you make the best of
    it!\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nFor applications, I would recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/Fonts-Encodings-Yannis-Haralambous/dp/0596102429/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1300021768&sr=8-1|Fonts
    & Encodings]]. It covers most of the major applications, including a number of
    free ones (good for when you are just starting up). It includes all of the gory
    details, which are difficult to get elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are some [[http://typophile.com/node/28627|debates]]
    about the best books to use, but I liked [[http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1300022221&sr=1-1|Karen
    Cheng]].\r\n\r\nFinally, you may want to check out [[http://www.typeradio.org/loudblog/index.php?loc=news|Type
    Radio]]. It will give you a good feel of the life of a type designer. I think
    the most telling interview so far was with [[http://www.typeradio.org/loudblog/index.php?cat=Buivenga,Jos|Jos
    Buivenga]], the number one seller on MyFonts. Even he has a difficult time supporting
    himself exclusively on type design.\r\n\r\nYou should listen to Jean - post your
    designs here and have some fun. The last thing you want to do right now is worry
    about the money!\r\n\r\n-Neil "

  body: "Hey Jean and Neil,\r\n\r\nthanks for the helpful information. I'll check
    out FontLab Studio and Fonts & Encodings. I figured there were apps out there
    to deal exclusively with type. Your book recommendation and Type Radio look like
    invaluable resources.\r\n\r\nI knew i wouldn't see cash from this right away (assuming
    my fonts are good enough), but if theres a chance to make a small amount of money
    doing something i enjoy then thats fine with me. \r\n\r\nI'll show you guys my
    designs when they're ready. I stand to gain a lot from your critiques.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!\r\n\r\n-nick"
