  to these three characters because I actually liked them (unlike the other 23).\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for critique on their design, as well as any ideas on a direction to take
  with this font... I don't really want to copy any other fonts, but if anyone knows
  of any fonts similar to these letters I've drawn, I would like to be able to look
  to them for reference once I get stuck on certain letters (like I certainly will).\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: E seems a bit too bottom heavy. Looking at rather thin strokes of the F it
    looks it's lighter than the other two.

  body: "the G is the only reason I'm still working on this :)\r\n\r\nI really like
    the bottom of the E, so I tried to fatten up the bottom of the F to match, but
    then my G looks even smaller and I have to fatten the bottom right serif (terminology,
    y'all!) and it just wonks the whole thing up.\r\n\r\n@D. Wiewauters: I can see
    where you get that; in fact, the 'A' that I drew with these letters is the same
    kind of humped-top 'A' as Los Feliz has"

  body: "The G seems a bit narrow to me compared to the E and F. They all appear to
    be meant to be fairly compressed, but the round forms always look smaller than
    their squarish counterparts, which is why they are generally made a little bigger;
    to compensate for that illusion. The G needs a bit of overshoot, both horizontally
    and vertically. That should also give you some breathing room to thicken up the
    serif a bit too.\r\n\r\nI like the design in general, though. It looks like it
    would go good with ice cream."
