  am looking for either of the italicized fonts in these posters most importantly,
  but if any one know either of the non-italicized fonts that would also be brilliant
  :)  Thank you in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/I Gave a Man_4455.png]"

  body: "I GAVE A MAN!  The scripts we have suggested so far lack the tone of the
    anguished and explosive cry for help of this lettering. Note the sharp corners.
    \ As a substitute I would use BiffBamBoom by Comicraft http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/biff-bam-boom/
    The lettering is very successful because it expresses the vigor shown in BiffBamBoom
    within the frame work of a less staccato treatment of the tops and bottoms of
    letters. A good project for a font maker.\r\nSomewha similar idea with Piekos
