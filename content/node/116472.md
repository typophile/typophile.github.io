  and join the conversations, for my first post I was wanting to get some feedback.
  I am currently working on some basic branding for myself and was wanting to know
  what you thought of the mark I made for myself. Could I get general impressions
  and what you think is wrong with it? Thanks so much!\r\n\r\nHere is my Old logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AN_Logo_5381.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
  is my new one:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2014-05-12 at

  body: "Andrew, how would this logo be used? And would your name appear below it
    as it does above?\r\n\r\nAs hrant said, those closely space lines won't reproduce
    well in all situations (like small sizes), but since you're a visual communications
    major I presume you'd make adjustments as necessary.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, my concept behind it is that I both a designer and front-end developer
    in one, so I combined my initials into one form. Not sure that its the strongest
    concept though. I might just go back to my sketchbook.\r\n\r\nJames, It would
    be used just how it is shown above. Mostly on my portfolio site and business cards.
    I just wanted a basic logo, instead of typesetting my whole name like allot of
    people have been doing. \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback by the way, it means allot.
    :)"

  body: "I think a pairing of letters actually offers great opportunities for expressing
    the dualism you mention. Think about how each side could be visually expressed
    (and which letter would be better at representing which aspect). Consider both
    uppercase and lowercase forms \u2013 and not necessarily the same for both*. Somehow
    fusing the two letters is generally nice, but not indispensable.\r\n\r\n* In fact
    a lc-UC sequence of itself sort of subtly conveys \"developer\".\r\n\r\nBTW what's
    that font you're using to set your name. And are you married to it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: hrant-I love all the feedback you just gave me! Thank you so much! I'm currently
    using Lato just because thats what I have on my portfolio site I am developing.
    So no, I am not married to it at all. When I get some extra cash I plan on buying
    typeface rights and changing it anyways. Do you have any suggestions? I'll play
    with the letterforms a bit more and see what I get. Thanks again!

  body: "> I might just go back to my sketchbook.\r\n\r\nDesigning a logo for yourself
    is difficult. I've known good designers who have been revising their own logos
    for years and still aren't satisfied. That's one reason many design firms end
    up just setting their name in type and leave it at that (Pentagram.com in an example).\r\n\r\nWe
    can offer advice, but ultimately you need to pick one that reflects your own style
    and personality."

  body: "If you think the designer/developer duality is a distinguishing and marketable
    thing about you, apply it to the font too!\r\n\r\nFree fonts save money, but since
    they're so easy to acquire they're not good for standing out. Also they generally
    don't render too well on all kinds of displays.\r\n\r\nSo try to find a recent
    commercial typeface that evokes your two aspects. Possibly something from this
    compilation:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2013/\r\nWhat
    about Program?\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/program/\r\nWhat's
    interesting about Program here BTW is that it actually contains a duality itself!
    The Regular and Narrow styles have a different character.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
