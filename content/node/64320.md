  body: "I know you did not ask these things Michael, but I thought I might share
    some of the problems we have been having with snow leopard in our office. \r\n\r\n1.
    Does not support our color inkjet printer. The patch epson offers kinda works
    but not really. It actually has caused our HP Laserjet to start fussing as well.
    \r\n\r\n2. Our font management software, Suitcase, has gone haywire. \r\n\r\n3.
    Some of our smaller applications like Stopwatch (for timesheets) needed to be
    updated and fixed, which actually deleted all our timesheets.\r\n\r\nAnyways just
    some food for thought before you upgrade. I did some research but somehow missed
    that these things would cause a problem. We have had no issues with actual font
    files themselves. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "FWIW, I can second no [special] problems with FontLab 5.0.4 on OS 10.6.2.\r\n\r\nJust
    one thing: If you get that new \"Magic Mouse\" (which I think is quite cool),
    \r\nI recommend switching off \"scroll with momentum\" whenever using FontLab,
    which doesn't seem able to do the \"momentum\" and just scrolls around in the
    glyph windows like crazed. :-)"

    font management in general, and OS manufacturers who are willing to support old
    software, it is difficult to beat the rock-solid combination of Windows 7 and
    gazillion-year-old ATM Deluxe for NT. Both work quite nicely together. You can
    even build your own MM instances -- which will be usable in ANY program running
    under Windows. Snow Leopard's inexplicable replacement of Mac-style Creator-based
    program opening with Windows-style extension-based program opening will also be
    a nightmare for anyone who has used a Mac prior to late 2009. It's difficult to
    understand what Apple is doing and why, as regards the OS."
