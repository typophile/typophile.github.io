  a search and couldn't find anything.\r\nI wonder what font is used on this infamous
  sign K. WEST, i.e. the one that can see on the David Bowie album 'The Rise and Fall
  of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars'\r\nAnybody know what this can be or
  if not, what could I use as an alternative. I want to make a T-shirt-screenprint\r\n\r\nby
  the way,  there is someone that has the original sign:\r\nhttp://www.5years.com/kwestsign.htm"
