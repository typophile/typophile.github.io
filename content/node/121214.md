  which I sell on my website for only $10 (personal or commercial use). A very large
  corporation has contacted me with interest in licensing the font from me. I sell
  primarily to individual users so I'm at a loss for how to structure the pricing.
  \r\n\r\nMy EULA specifies that there must be a separate license purchased for each
  individual user but that wouldn't work for such a large company. They said they
  own several fonts from larger foundries and they license it to them for a flat fee
  based on their usage.\r\n\r\nI know it's a personal decision but I don't want to
  grossly over or undercharge. Is there an average industry standard or at least a
  ballpark that is fair? Thanks in advance for any insight."

    somewhere between $9000 and $20,000 per font or more. Questions to ask: Desktop
    only? Web fonts\" Applications? Commercial embedding? The more answers yes to
    these questions the higher the license fee. \r\n\r\nGood luck noob."

  body: Thanks so much for your help. I just requested a list of their intended uses
    so hopefully I can narrow it down a bit from there. I can't believe the price
    tag on corporate licenses... wow. Fingers crossed they decide to accept!
