body: I'm trying to make a very specific type ID on a very notable identity. The identity
  was done on a Compugraphic Editwriter 7500. Is there a list somewhere of the fonts
  that came stock?  I'm mostly interested in something like a Bodoni Poster Compressed.

    anything \"stock\" came with the machine. That was before the days of the 35 Basic
    Postscript fonts and whatever fonts you bought when you placed an order for the
    machine would be what you started with.\r\n\r\nI think your best bet would be
    to scan the type in question and place it here: [[http://www.typophile.com/typeid
    | TypeID]]"

    body: "I know that the machine was a phototypesetter. I just assumed that that
      CG were offering the machine with a complimentary grab-bag of filmstrips or
      something.\r\n\r\nI might try the ID board. I can't find any evidence of any
      kind of Compugraphics condensed Bodoni. If anybody has a 70s-80s Compugraphics
      catalog that I could nerd-out on, I'd be much obliged.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Compugraphic fonts that are still around have a Cg prefix to the name. They
    are now part of the Agfa library with name like CgCloister, CgOmega etc.

  body: Cg Poster Bodoni was the only version they had - no compressed or condensed
    version mentioned anywhere. Could have been compressed photographically in doing
    the art. Lots of versions of Compressed Poster Bodoni are around today like from
    Adobe etc.

  body: "1977 \u2022 The Compugraphic EditWriter 7500 is introduced and becomes an
    instant succes. This phototypesetter combines a keyboard and photo unit in one
    piece of equipment, enabling one job to be typeset while the operator simultaneously
    keyboards another. Separate units such as the Mini-Disk Terminal (MDT) and Mini-Disk
    Reader (MDR) allow off-line text entry and phototypesetting using 8\u2033 floppy
    disks. The output  is imaged onto photo paper which is up to 8 inches wide. TYPE
    CAN BE SET IN SIZES FROM 6 TO 72 POINTS, USING A SYSTEM OF SWAPPABLE FONT DISKS
    AND VARIOUS FIXED LENSES MOUNTED ON AN INTERNAL TURRET.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.prepressure.com/prepress/history/events-1970-1979"

  body: "I was involved in the purchase of several EditWriters back then. Bob, that
    citation you quote mentions \u201Cfont disks\u201D but the EditWriter used font
    strips, which were strips of film negative, about 18 inches by 4 inches, with
    metal clips on the ends, that fit around a metal drum inside the machine. Each
    strip held four fonts, usually a single family with four styles. You could fit
    two strips in the machine at once, for a total of eight fonts. There were also
    ROM cartridges (called a \u201Cwidth card\u201D for each font strip containing
    spacing and kerning information that needed to be inserted into the machine. \r\n\r\nWhen
    you ordered a machine, if I recall correctly, you got two font strips as part
    of the deal. They could be anything from the CG library, but the default was Helios
    II (CG\u2019s Helvetica look-alike) and English Times (CG's Times Roman look-alike).
    Beyond that, it cost $380 for each font strip ($45 extra for each ITC font to
    pay for the royalties). If you bought several at once, there was a price break.\r\n\r\nCompugraphic
    didn't use the CG prefix until the 1981 when they released exact copies of \u201Ctypefaces
    most frequently specified in the graphics industry\u201D in a series they called
    the \u201CTypographers Edition.\u201D These included CG Century, CG Century Old
    Style, CG Century Schoolbook, CG Frontiera (Frutiger), CG Goudy Old Style, CG
    Melliza (Melior), CG Omega (Optima), CG Palacio (Palatino), CG Plantin, CG Times,
    CG Trade (Trade Gothic), CG Triumvirate (Helvetica), and CG Trump Mediaeval. \r\n\r\nI
    have a CG catalog from 1977 that has a bunch of Bodoni styles, but no condensed.
    They did release <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59473\">ITC Condensed</a>
    (a.k.a. ITC Fat Face Condensed) in 1981, which was a very condensed fat face style,
    and also Manchester Condensed (a.k.a. Madison Condensed), another Bodoni-like
    modern face."

    body: "Thanks Mr. Simonson! I suspected that CompuGraphics might have supplied
      a few strips with their machines. I didn't realize that those ROM cartridges
      carried spacing and kerning information, that's wild! I can see how that would
      have saved typesetters a lot of time in those days. I'm glad that the information
      you provided is now on the net. Recently, I had hit a pretty stern dead-end
      on any detailed typeface information about this machine.\r\n\r\nThe typeface
      I'm looking for is in the Bodoni Poster Compressed/Onyx/Arsis neighborhood.
      I'm finally starting to embrace the typographic community's aggravation with
      aliases and knockoffs. They make for too many needles in too many haystacks.\r\n\r\n"

    body: I'm looking for the CG Omega font that has a bar in the G and a W that joins
      the lines in a T below the terminal.  I get the feeling the font strip was different
      from the online versions we see today.  Do you still have that book?

  body: "I don\u2019t recall why they used ROM cartridges. Competing machines from
    AM/Varityper didn\u2019t need them. The film fonts were on spinning discs that
    somehow had the spacing info encoded (some kind of tick marks or whatever). I
    used both at various times. \r\n\r\nA useless but possibly interesting footnote:
    What sold me on the Compugraphic machines was the fact that they used discrete
    lenses for each point size. The AM machines used a zoom lens. This was great in
    that it allowed many more type sizes, but it also was less reliable. The sharpness
    of the type depended on whether you went <i>up</i> to a point size from a smaller
    size or <i>down</i> to a point size from a larger size. So, depending on which
    way you were going, you might need to insert an extra size change beyond the size
    you wanted to make sure the type was in focus.\r\n\r\nPeople have no idea how
    much simpler certain things are than they used to be."

  body: "It could have been they used ROM cartridges because putting tick marks on
    the negative was patented.\r\n\r\nOr, it could have been that tick marks on the
    negative would work for spacing information... but if you also wanted to do <strong>kerning</strong>
    you needed too much information for that, and so the ROM cartridges contributed
    to typographic quality by allowing automatic kerning, as opposed to manual kerning.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I see that Circuitous Root is planning to scan a Compugraphic type catalogue;
    I hope they do manage that soon."
