  (very cheap)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of it? I'm looking forward to using this typeface
  in web/screen work, maybe in display sizes.\r\n\r\nDoes it remind you of some other
  typeface? At first I ran into this font on the web and thought it was another copy
  of something else. It turns out to be a standalone typeface.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's
  a quick specimen (attached). I like what I'm seeing thus far."
