    Discussion</strong> forum, where we discuss topics related to type that do not
    fit in one of the other forums. On the home page, the General Discussion forum
    bears the description\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>General Discussions</strong>\r\nAll
    topics are welcome\u2014<strong><em>except font ID requests</em></strong>.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n(emphasis
    added, as it seems to be overlooked so often)\r\n\r\nand so for font ID requests,
    please <a href=\"http://typophile.com/typeid\">post in the Font ID forum</a>."
