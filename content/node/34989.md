body: "Greeting Friends!\r\n\r\nIt is our distinct pleasure to announce the return
  of the first Filmotype typefaces to return to the graphic designers palette since
  their heyday in the 1950s as photo lettered alphabets.\r\n\r\nThe first two releases
  are Filmotype Glenlake and Filmotype MacBeth\r\n\r\nFilmotype Glenlake - Initially
  designed and released in 1955, this Gothic Sans Serif having disappeared from graphic
  design history reappeared in 1994's Ed Wood in it's starring role as the opening
  credits of Woods famous film \"Glen or Glenda\" ironically.\r\n\r\nIt is joined
  by Filmotype MacBeth - This Free Style typeface owes its origins to Lettering Inc
  where its original author penned a similar style prior to creating a unique version
  of the typeface for Filmotype in the early 1950s.\r\n\r\nBoth typefaces were remastered
  and expanded with exacting precision and include a full international character
  compliment, automatic fractionals, ordinals, and a complete suite of alternate characters
  in dynamic OpenType format.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy these timeless gems of typographic
  design and will find them as exciting as we have.\r\n\r\nYou can purchase, preview
  and discover more about these faces online exclusivly at Font Bros!\r\n\r\nSee 'em

  body: Stuart, congratulations. I don't know much about Filmotype -- are you planning
    to whet our appetites with a peek at what else is in the vault, awaiting digitization?
