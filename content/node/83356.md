  URL, they show TWO different versions of the lower case letter \"r\".\r\nThe SPECIMEN
  shows BOTH versions (See Pork Pie vs Caerphilly), while the CHARACTER SET show the
  \"Caerphilly\" version. Is there a way to access this alternate letter \"r\", or
  is this just a mistake?  Thank you.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FILM-LASA-CS_3519.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FILM-LASA-SP_6499.gif]"

    look at glyphs 83 and 393 at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lasalle/regular/characters.html|here]],
    the font contains an alternate 'r'.\r\n\r\n\r\nSB"
