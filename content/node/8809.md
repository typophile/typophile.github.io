    <BR>I am still looking, but the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide, Part 7</a> could be a good place to look,
    as Daniel suggested.

  body: See Artemisia and especially Monte Carlo Script at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg7.html"
    target="_blank"> this page </a> in the Guide. <BR> <BR>Monte Carlo is a Nick Curtis
    revival, and I think it&#39;s freeware.
