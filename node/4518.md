  body: Whoa &#39;billygene&#39;! The poster acknowledged it was hand drawn and just
    wanted to know if anything else was close. Your rude tone isn&#39;t necessary
    or appreciated. We try to help folks here, not pounce on them for honest questions.
    <BR> <BR>An italic like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-berkeley-old-style/itc-berkeley-oldstyle-book-italic/testdrive.html?s=North%2BSea&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Berkeley Old Style</a> is a bit neater, but has some of the same
    feel, perhaps. You might also find some hand-drawn fonts that could come close
    enough. Check Part 6, Part 8 or  Part 11 of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide</a> for possibilties.

  body: Thanks for the help Mike. I was looking for something with a bit of whimsy
    and Berkeley might work if I tweak it.
