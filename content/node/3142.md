  body: Ok, thanks. But I&#39;m looking for something that looks more like this. This
    one isn&#39;t very nice though, but you get the idea. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/26576.jpg"

    think it was ID&#39;d by Mark Simonson.

  body: Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right there Stephen. Thing is, I want it to make
    the viewer think of the old stereotype of Sweden and porn. But maybe there isn&#39;t
    any specific faces that will do that. The faces on the books doesn&#39;t really
    do what I want to accomplish.

    do.
