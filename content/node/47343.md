  morning while scouring the net for some inspiration for logo/font design.  I am
  completely new to typography so please bear with me!  I manage a new and up coming
  film director and what I am looking for is some help with a design and some ideas
  of what fonts we could use for his logo.    \r\n\r\nWe have decided to go for a
  logo is the style of art deco as it is a style that seems quite synonymous with
  the film industry.  However we are open to other ideas that might suit a logo for
  this purpose. We are looking for something that encompasses clean and simple, but
  classic  with an edge if that is possible!  I  have approached a couple of companies
  and so far the results have not been too good.  I have either had designs that are
  \ bland and boring- or ones that look like they have been nabbed from an old clip
  art album.  First impressions are important and so we need this to be good- hence
  why I am out scouring for some ideas so that we get what we want!.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you for reading. I look forward to your ideas!\r\n\r\nNeha\r\n\r\n"

    soliciting spec work, it's no surprise that the results have been unsatisfactory.
    \ You get what you pay for.\r\n\r\nYou should find a few local design firms whose
    portfolios you like.  Ask them to bid on your project and for your sake, be more
    specific in your brief.  The description \"clean and simple, modern/contemporary
    style, but classic with an edge\" is internally inconsistent and frankly impossible
    to work with.  You shouldn't necessarily go for the lowest bidder.  Finally, work
    with them and trust them.\r\n\r\nI wish you luck."

  body: "Yeah Neha, Red is correct. Spec work is frowned on in this industry and considered
    to be [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work|unethical.]]\r\n\r\nA
    logo is not a font (but sometimes can be with altered letter-spacing etc). So
    looking for a font for a logo will not make the logo - the designer makes the
    logo. A similar analogy would be to assume that by buying an excellent 35mm motion
    camera you can make a great movie...\r\n\r\nYou get the idea.\r\n\r\nA resource
    like [[www.dandad.org|D&AD]] in the UK should be able to help find a designer."
