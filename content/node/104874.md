    for instance with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-mono|PF DIN
    Mono]] Medium and customize it by adding mainly some triangle shapes to angles.
    /W would remain a bit off though."

    version of a 1950s Swiss typeface - for any text positioned alongside the logo,
    while any images can be positioned underneath."
