  body: The combination Ctrl+Alt on Windows is equivalent to AltGr. You need a keyboard
    driver that maps this combination, though. A lot of Windows keyboards, especially
    non Latin, use Ctrl+Alt (and Ctrl+Alt+Shift) for rare characters in a given writing
    system. You have to be careful when creating such keyboard layouts though, because
    you can run into interference from Office hotkey combinations.
