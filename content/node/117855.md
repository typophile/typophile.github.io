  body: Thanks for the suggestions kthomps5... I was actually hoping for a cleaned-up
    version of this, not so rough and hand-drawn. It's for a branding project. Any
    other ideas?

    issue is finding something with a curved foot on the R, that little upflip on
    the right terminal of the horizontal stroke on the 4, and the 9s with the curled
    up bottom stroke. Some of the above only have two out of those three.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Engravers|Engravers]]. With
    some little adjustments (mainly /R leg and /4), you could get pretty much there.
    [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/luxuryfonts|Luxury]] Diamond is also interesting.\r\nIf
    you're particularly after such a /R leg but open-minded for a different overall
    design, you might be interested by [[http://typophile.com/node/99936|De Vinne]]
    and especially in this case one of its reinterpretation [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/romana|Romana]].
