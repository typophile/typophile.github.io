  ago, I noticed that the banner on <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/\">this</a>
  page on the Apple website is missing a fi ligature in the word \"find.\" Myriad
  Pro definitely has the fi ligature, but it is not used. \r\n\r\nMy friend says that
  ligatures are not necessary in large font sizes, such as in billboards. I thought
  otherwise. The ligature definitely looks a lot smoother than doing without it. \r\n\r\nI
  don't remember any mention in school of not needing ligatures in billboards. \r\n\r\nSomeone
  suggested that perhaps the use of ligatures in large type has to do with whether
  it is serif or sans serif fonts are used. I can see how in a serif fonts the f and
  the i have more of a tendency to overlap, but I'm not exactly sure. \r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on all of this?"

    realm. And they do make sense there. But I also think they have a big role to
    play in immersive text setting too, and this hasn't really been explored.\r\n\r\nSo
    in answer to your specific question I myself would say that an \"fi\" ligature
    is a good idea much more often than not, especially on a billboard. But it has
    to be well-made, and many of them are not, because: it's a rarer character so
    it gets less attention; and it can be hard to get the internal spacing just right.
    If it's not well-made it'll do more damage than an \"f\"+\"i\". You could also
    use an \"f\" + \"dotless-i\" sometimes with good effect.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Think about viewing a billboard. Its not like you are 2 feet from it. Its
    likely you are some distance from it and it appears about the size of display
    type in a publication. As Chris says if it doesn't look right it isn't.

  body: "&#8658; <em>If it looks bad, it probably is.</em>\r\n\r\nTo my knowlege,
    the original and primary purpose of a ligature was to improve spacing between
    two or more problematic combination of characters. Historically, they were particularly
    useful in book setting where eveness of text color was important and because inter-character
    spacing was more difficult to adjust with metal type. It seems, in general, that
    serif designs tend to require ligatures more than sans serif.\r\n\r\nSo as Chris
    mentioned, your eyes tell it. The only \"rule\" you should follow is to use a
    particular ligature if it IMPROVES or \"evens out\" the visual spacing between
    characters and not merely because the ligature exists.\r\n\r\nZoom into the <a
    href=\"http://museum.antwerpen.be/plantin_moretus/images/groot_18.jpg\" target=\"new\"><em>Graduale
    Romanum</em></a> printed by Jan I Moretus in 1599. You can see a multitude of
    ligatures in use, the common ones (fi, ct, long s+t) and historic ones such as
    double long 's', long s+a,  long s+c, long s+i. "
