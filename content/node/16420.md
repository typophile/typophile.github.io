  i'd ask you for advice...\r\n\r\nI am doing this school prject,\r\nwhere designing
  a corporate identity program \r\nfor a fitness center and fitness program,... \r\nwhich
  it's name unfortunatly I can not tell... : (\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short,
  my logo is mostly done i am happy with it,\r\nand the name for the logo-type, after
  strong thought, is set in Avant Garde lowercase...( i personally dislike its \"s\")
  \r\nbut because I lack of any other good fresh examples, for a geometric sans serif,
  and of using futura... I'm not sure. ; /\r\n\r\n- Other geometric sans serifs?\r\n\r\nEven
  If I consider leaving the logotype set in lowercase avant garde, or other geometric
  sans,\r\nI still need to find a good strong corporate font that would work well
  for most usage,\r\nthis is probably stationary at body copy sizes, display and even
  big headlines.\r\nI feel it has to be a dynamic, versatile, fresh and hype, \r\n(I
  know someone is going to blame me for this last word), \r\nmore femenine oriented
  than for example HTF Knockout which i was considering,...\r\n\r\nHope this does
  not sound like nonsense\r\nAny suggestions are very welcomed as I belive\r\nthis
  can help me learn more and help my project.\r\nI will certanly be glad to lisecence
  for my personal use the chosen font...\r\n(most likely in OpenType format)\r\n\r\nThanks.
  once more.\r\n\r\nGiovanni\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's not the typeface you choose, but what you do with it.\r\nFor instance,
    the Apple OS comes with a lot of fonts (Hiragino Gothic etc.) that are primarily
    non-Latin; however, many of them have Latin characters also. Usually a bit naff
    (as opposed to hype), but in \"beating them into shape\", as it were, i.e. making
    them work in a typographic setting by adjusting tracking, leading, kerning, etc.,
    who knows what interesting developments may emerge?"

    certain doubts I'm still making my ming in between Gotham and Auto.\r\nAuto seems
    more tasty but i think gotham seems more versatile for all uses,...\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    thanks ; )\r\n\r\nGio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you need something much less... portly than AGG. Something contemporary,
    and somewhat rigid. Gotham for example is too round, as well as a bit old-fashioned.
    Auto is better (especially like a dark weight of its first Italic). But ask Stephen,
    and he'll totally drown you in somewhat-rigid-humanist-sans font choices!  :-)\r\n\r\n>
    It\u2019s not the typeface you choose, but what you do with it.\r\n\r\n?\r\nDo
    you say this to your own prospective customers?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
