<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone know anything at all about various U.S. license plates and the faces used on them (does anyone care as much as I do)? I've noticed three basic categories for plates, which I classify thusly: <br> <br>1)Non-designed... these appear to have been fashioned strictly with the limitations of production-machinery in mind, it would seem that almost no thought went into psychological issues (legibility, etc.)--I'll let this class be represented by the state of Ohio (but it seems Class 1 is actually the style used by most states). <br> <br>2)Semi-designed... at least SOME thought beyond mechanical constraints went into the design of these plates (the attempt to make the forms more human has resulted in these plates being significantly more legible than Class 1 at great distances)--represented by West Virginia*. <br> <br>3)Fully-designed... I've seen only one state so far that fits this category--Virginia. These plates are amazing, their face is both seriffed AND modulated (and legibility at great distance is excellent). <br> <br>Which brings me to my point... I contacted the Ohio BMV about the plates' type designer, and the response was that the 3M Corporation did the work. I don't believe, however, that my question was fully understood. I think 3M may have devised the production (printing) method, but not the actual typeface design. <br> <br>And my question to all of you... I also contacted the Virginia BMV about their plates, but an official quickly wrote back that he didn't know who designed the face--do any of you know who designed Virginia's license plate typeface? I'm dying to know. <br> <br> <br> <br>*In an especially ironic twist, Ohioans and West Virginians are perpetually feuding over who's the classiest and most metropolitan of the two, Ohio usually wins, I think (is it because I live in Ohio?), because we have cities like Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. West Virginia's license plates are designed better than Ohio's, they just look better too--and this is funny because Ohio would never want to be second to West Virginia in anything (I don't feel this way--not an Ohio native).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you just need to be more persistent, and maybe act more important and officious. <br> <br>BTW, what do the Virginia plates look like? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>A car with Virginia plates is parked down the street as we speak, I wish I could go take a photograph for posting, but I'm sure the owner wouldn't be thrilled if he saw me in the act. <br> <br>Virginia plates themselves are fairly nondescript (white plate, navy blue lettering), which actually helps to showcase the typeface (and, in my opinion at least, increases general legibility). I think this whole structure was carefully planned, the state of Virginia seems to know what they're doing. <br> <br>On your advice, I'll persist for an answer.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Scott, this does not answer your question, but at least it's on topic: <a href=http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001785.html target=_blank>A License Plate for every Taste</a>, at Speak Up. <br> <br>And there is a good article about license plates in the <a href=http://www.dgusa.com/PUBS/STEP/step.aspx target=_blank>latest issue of STEP Magazine</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here are some shots of those plates: <br>Ohio... <a href=http://www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_OHXX.html target=_blank>www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_OHXX.html</a> <br>West Virginia... <a href=http://www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_WVXX.html target=_blank>www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_WVXX.html</a> <br>Virginia... <a href=http://www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_VAXX.html target=_blank>www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_VAXX.html</a> <br> <br>In this case, I think it's good. You'd think that seriffed forms would not be the best choice for an object that requires easy recognition and travels at high speeds (or moves at all), but just a few days ago I had the rare opportunity to observe three cars on the highway just outside of Cleveland--one from Ohio, one from West Virginia, and yes, one from Virginia. I realized that some cosmic force was allowing me the chance to test legibility among the three classes I just listed above; so I slowed my speed and watched... <br> <br>-At about 25 feet legibility was comparable in all three classes. <br>-At around 35 feet Ohio was seriously losing ground. <br>-At about 45 feet Ohio was entirely out, West Virginia was OK, and Virginia was clear as a bell. <br>-Past 80 feet Virginia was at least discernible, while Ohio and West Virginia were difficult to distinguish their state of origin. <br> <br>I'm not sure that too much research has been done in this field, doesn't seem that way.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am a graphic designer and I SOOOO wish we could go back to the old 2-color embossed plates. But you can't blame the designers, things like that have to be dumbed down for the tasteless committees that make these decisions. <br> <br>At least they aren't as ugly as our new money!!!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br>Yes, hat is the actual font. I went to the Virginia DMV page (motor vehicles) and selected their vanity plate link. It alows you to type in whatever will fit on any VA plate and will create the plate on-the-fly for you. There are actually many, many more plates to choose from. <br>&lt;<a href=https://www.dmv.state.va.us/dmvnet/online.asp target=_blank>https://www.dmv.state.va.us/dmvnet/online.asp</a>></div>

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps an interesting note on this discussion--and maybe an impetus for the particular font chosen for the plates--Virginia was the first state to actively and very eagerly encourage residents to personalize their plates (cheap too).</div>
