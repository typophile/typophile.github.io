  body: "It's hand-lettered. Tom Tryon's novel \"The Other\" was published in 1971.
    \ The jacket design is credited to Paul Bacon, who drew his own lettering.  [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/heroes-victore]]\r\n\r\nThis
    lettering  was also used on the movie poster.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big clue for me is
    the difference between the two h's (different ascender heights, different curves
    in the arch). \r\n\r\n"
