  \r\n\r\nAny ideas of a good body font to use? Something clean, modern, forward-looking
  and extremely readable. Thanks for your suggestions!"

  body: "Two strikes against Iowan here: you said \"progressive\", something to me
    a Jenson can't be; chances are his point size isn't low enough to justify the
    large x-height (although I guess it could be).\r\n\r\nI would look to the new
    child prodigy on the block: Turnip.\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/turnip/\r\nAlthough
    I'm not sure it harmonizes with Proxima Nova.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I would second Mr. Ellerton's suggestion for Iowan oldstyle pro, not only
    because he has a lot of experience and good taste, but because proxima nova has
    a lot of personality and Iowan OS is quiet and elegantly unobtrusive. I would
    be careful about two typefaces with too much personality competing. A font without
    too narrow a vintage would be desirable, especially for prolonged reading.

  body: "I think Proxima Nova would've been seen as having a lot of personality a
    decade or two ago - these days I think it's relatively sedate (which can be a
    good thing as you imply). I guess we need to get a better grasp of what \"progressive\"
    means here, and how much risk is desirable. To me every typesetting job is an
    opportunity to contribute something to cultural progress... sometimes covertly.
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nBTW a good match to Proxima Nova might be Archer (although I'm personally
    not a big fan of its Italic) or some other serif font where the \"a\" has a bouncy
    bowl.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Interesting discussion regarding the subject matter of the text in relation
    to the font.\r\nHere's some more background: the book is basically an extended
    case against the status quo in regards to certain religious beliefs. Since it's
    making a book-length argument, the typography needs to be clear and not distracting.
    The last thing I'd want is for someone to open it up and think \"wow--that's an
    odd font\" or even just be left with the feeling that something seems \"off\"
    in with text as compared with other books. I'm not looking to make a huge statement
    with the typography...the meaning of the text is doing it well enough. But I would
    like something that steps beyond the usual choices, that seems fresh and new and
    maybe even inspiring. And a nod to the past is fine as well. Just because a religious
    tradition is being questioned doesn't mean that all connections with the past
    must be severed. "

  body: "<blockquote>against the status quo</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the
    typography needs to harmonize with this - including the text font. But that doesn't
    mean it needs to scream \"look at me\" - in fact it almost never should. The thing
    is, text fonts work \"under the radar\" to make us <em>feel</em> things (as opposed
    to merely see things). Turnip for example certainly does look idiosyncratic when
    set/viewed large; but at text sizes that effect recedes and is replaced with a
    -judiciously- unconventional <em>texture</em> - that's the magic of text fonts.
    Does it recede enough? I don't know. That depends on a number of things, not least
    the point size.\r\n\r\nTo me the worst thing you can do is give up and just revert
    to something the Pope would use. (I mean the next one. :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Perhaps [[http://vllg.com/A2-Type/Antwerp#panel=usage-poster|Antwerp]] is
    a viable alternative for body copy? If you're still open to explore hints of history...
    it feels quite nice and familiar.

  body: "There was a mention of Archer a few responses back, and while Archer is certainly
    a good match for Proxima Nova, it has the penchant off coming off too quaint or
    overly-friendly if not used in it's proper context. I would tend to look at a
    few contemporary geometric slabs that are constructed for better readability than
    their historical counterparts. <strong>Sanchez</strong> by Latinotype: [[http://www.latinotype.com/#/gallery-sanchez]]
    is a slab I have experimented with that pairs fairly well with Proxima Nova, has
    a warmer personality than a traditional slab, and provides decent readability.
    \r\n\r\nIf you do go decide to try this pairing, I would also suggest you use
    the alternate lowercase \"a\" in Sanchez (accessible via OpenType) to match Proxima
    Nova's double story lowercase \"a\" since by default Sanchez uses a single story.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    look into contemporary slabs, including those that lean towards Humanist characteristics
    if you want a font that is a bit more distinguished from Proxima Nova without
    straying too far from it's common underlying structure."
