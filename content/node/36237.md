  body: "Right on Angel!  The little bead in the top of the 'o' is a signature of
    that one. When Mark was in Seattle for TypeCon we saw that one used to describe
    the Soups of the Day at the sandwich shop a couple of block from the conference
    hotel.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Yes indeed, I bought it a while ago and I have seen it used in lots of places
    too. Perhaps Mark's most popular font?

  body: It is indeed. Another great story is the one he tells about getting a piece
    of direct mail advertising that looked very convincingly like it was handwritten
    -- were it not using <em>his own handwriting</em> (Felt Tip Roman).
