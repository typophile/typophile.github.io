  the \"Season One\" and \"Season Two\" banners from the recent and upcoming Transformers
  Animated DVD sets.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Season Text_5182.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  anyone able to ID this font for me with so little?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. :D"

    just add the triangle 'spurs'. That was easier said than done. I searched the
    freebies at Dafont first, and then MyFonts, but I didn't see the right baseline
    font at either. \r\n\r\nPlan B would be to note that this is almost nothing but
    straight lines, and therefore would be pretty easy to draw.\r\n\r\nIt's probably
    a font that has been customized, but the techno look is so ubiquitous that it
    could be anywhere. I only hit two sites.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
