  a diary page for the mag I work for and at the moment we've got some awful piece
  of free rubbish that offends my eye. Can anyone recommend a half-decent, professional
  looking 'handwriting' font please?\r\n\r\nIt just needs to be something fairly informal
  and legible.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, \r\n\r\nG"
