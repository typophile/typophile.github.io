    you really want to support Typophile, I am sure they won't say no. Did you check
    out the <a href="http://typophile.com/membership">membership</a> area?

    special priviliges, no access to the Membership area, no nothing ; ).\r\nI guess
    \u2018our\u2019 guys were to busy redesigning the site, but I can't figure out
    why they don't respond to my emails\u2026"

    we can hook you up. Email typophile[at]punchcut[dot]com for details.\r\n\r\nTim,
    Bert, \r\n\r\nIf you paid in May, it's because you accessed the old site via an
    old link (since the membership forms haven't been up since May) and perhaps paid
    through PayPal. We're in the process of implementing a shopping cart and so the
    form is not currently publicly available. In the mean time, please send an email
    to typophile[at]punchcut[dot]com and we'll get you hooked up with a shirt and
    the Uppercase access.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience."
