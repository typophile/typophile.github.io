  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">After some 7 years of continuous use of Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows (yes, I'm a Windows user), today I switched to Mozilla Firefox. There will be no return.  <BR> <BR>I own a notebook with a high-res LCD screen (effective resolution: 133 ppi). I had to do a lot of tweaking to Microsoft Windows so the type doesn't appear too small on my screen. Reading numerous blogs has always been a challenge because of the pixel-sized, anti-accessible page design of these sites.  <BR> <BR>But this is over now, since I finally understood how many different options Mozilla Firefox holds in store for a power surfer.  <BR> <BR>The by far most important accessibility option is hidden under Tools / Options / General / Fonts &amp; Colors / Minimum Font Size. This simple setting (that needs to be set separately for each encoding) makes Firefox automatically enlarge all type that is smaller than the defined threshold. After I have set the regular font sizes to 18 and the minimum size to 15, no badly designed website, not even Typographica ;) , will hurt my eyes.  <BR> <BR>After I installed two Firefox extensions (ColorZilla and Web Developer from <a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/" target="_blank"><a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/">https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/</a></a> ), I also received two separate options for powerful page zooming. Unfortunately, strange rendering problems occur when I try to zoom in using ColorZilla and zoom out using Web Developer, so the solution isn't perfect.  <BR> <BR>Also, the simple and brilliant zoom combo box in Opera is still unprecedented. So when I run into a web page that is all done in bitmap graphics and the type is simply too small, I open it in Opera and set the zoom to 200%, or sometimes 150%. I still don't understand why web browser manufacturers didn't implement this simple feature on standard basis &ndash; after all, wordprocessors such as Microsoft Word have had it for ages.  <BR> <BR>But in general, I find Opera somewhat dodgy. I never could get into its strange screen setup, while Firefox captured me from the day I installed the final release. I already managed to grab some more extensions from <a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/" target="_blank"><a href="https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/">https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/</a></a> and installed all possible developer menus ad and popup blockers, as well as a very handy tool that enhances Google search results with web page thumbnails from Alexa.  <BR> <BR>Then I packed some essential RSS feeds into Firefox's &quot;live bookmarks&quot;. Since Firefox isn't quite a full-blown RSS reader (I'm still really getting used to RSS), I experimented with a few offline browsers such as SharpReader. In the end, I decided that I like FeedDemon most: <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/">http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/</a></a>  <BR> <BR>This little application is written by Nick Bradbury who in the past had written Allaire HomeSite and TopStyle &ndash; two beautifully designed, well-engineered web design applications (HomeSite was later taken over by Macromedia). The &quot;newspaper view&quot; of RSS feeds in FeedDemon is just so cute: <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/screenshots/screen.asp?img=2" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/screenshots/screen.asp?img=2">http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/screenshots/screen.asp?img=2</a></a>  <BR> <BR>The application still has its pitfalls, but I think it has great potential. Its user interface is well designed, and there is nothing I hate more than ugly computer applications. (If you want to see one, take a look at <a href="http://www.ghisler.com/picture.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ghisler.com/picture.htm">http://www.ghisler.com/picture.htm</a></a> &ndash; it's an application I often use but truly revile its UI design).  <BR> <BR>So, today, my reading experience on-screen has improved dramatically. ClearType definitely remains OFF on my machine. What I'm really missing now is a well-done superhinted monospaced font that renders in two-pixel stems in the common screen sizes in the regular cut, and in three or four-pixel stems in the bold. Lucida Console is very good, but doesn't have a bold! Andale Mono is very well-hinted and has an extensive character set, but also doesn't have a bold, and is simply way too thin (renders one-pixel stems in fairly large ppem sizes).  <BR> <BR>I'm looking forward to seeing Luc(as)' de Groot's Consolas as part of the Microsoft ClearType font collection, but I gather it will not be superhinted for black-and-white, but only fasthinted for ClearType. And, as I mentioned, ClearType remains OFF on my machine <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>For the time being, I made a custom font family by glueing together Lucida Console with Arial Monospaced Bold. I had to tweak their font metrics so they go along well, but of course, instead of doing this sort of hacking, I'd much prefer if somebody simply made a good, usable, monospaced screen font. Or maybe I'm missing something?  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think I'll try Firefox soon. <BR> <BR>&gt; This simple setting (that needs to be set <BR>&gt; separately for each encoding) makes Firefox <BR>&gt; automatically enlarge all type that is smaller <BR>&gt; than the defined threshold. <BR> <BR>Does it propagate the font size increase to the other/larger sizes, or does it just truncate up the bottom end? If it's the latter, that can disrupt proper information hierarchy through size (although that's admittedly not as bad as illegibility). <BR> <BR>&gt; ClearType definitely remains OFF on my machine. <BR> <BR>It's interesting to hear that from such a &quot;progressive&quot; user. But I trust your judgment. <BR> <BR>&gt; What I'm really missing now is a well-done <BR>&gt; superhinted monospaced font that renders in <BR>&gt; two-pixel stems in the common screen sizes <BR>&gt; in the regular cut, and in three or four-pixel <BR>&gt; stems in the bold. <BR> <BR>Would you settle for a pixelfont? You'd have to switch fonts with size however. How does Mana-16 look on your screen? It's not monospaced though. <BR> <BR>BTW, don't the existing MS core fonts render with 2-pixel stems at your &quot;ideal&quot; size of 18? Oh, they do, but they become anti-aliased&hellip; What if you fooled with GASP tables to switch off anti-aliasing? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On my 100dpi Powerbook I use a monospace font for almost all my writing: programming, e-mails, diary, conference write-ups and MyFonts newsletters. In programming I've always liked to have similar lines lining up exactly: array[i] should align perfectly with array[j] and array[k]. The visual tidiness is a reminder of their semantic similarity. In other types of writing, I like to notice stray spaces, lowercase l's, and periods as I type. This is made more difficult if the speed at which the cursor moves is not proportional to the typing speed. To a writer, the w is just as important as the i. When proof-reading too, I find errors easier to spot in monospace: I suppose the seductive wordshapes put me off. <BR> <BR>I use black-on-white Monaco 10 (1-pixel stems) for e-mail, where I spend a lot of time, white-on-black Bitstream Vera Bold 13 (2 pixels) for programming, and white-on-black Monaco 11 (1 pixel) for my Unix terminal. I should probably change the last one since the bold is synthesized and only legible in context (amazing how an m can be read easily even if it's a solid rectangle). <BR> <BR>What a shame that writing and typography have merged in today's applications, and that the perfection attained by WordPerfect 5.1 for writers will not return any time soon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sergej,  <BR> <BR>in my programming work, I often work in a column mode, where I can make rectangular selections in the text editor.  <BR> <BR>Example: when editing feature definition files, after having pasted some glyph names from Microsoft Excel, I want to be quickly able to type &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;by&quot; in the appropriate positions. Or, for example, type &quot;.ss02&quot; at the end of some glyph names that are aligned in a column. See:  <BR><a href="http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/dlig.png" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/dlig.png">http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/dlig.png</a></a> <BR> <BR>Programming often involves putting repeating or similar sequences in different arrangements. Your  eye needs to jump up and down often, when comparing, for example, two different function definitions. Just like the baseline gives an unified horizontal text structure in a normal reading process, monospace metrics provide a vertical visual aid. It's much easier to notice if a line is &quot;off by one&quot; or that you have mistyped some variable name if your text is aligned in monospace blocks.  <BR> <BR>As mentioned before, currently, for most of my monospace stuff I stick to Lucida Console which has the nice property of having quite short ascender and descender. This actually doesn't disturb me at all &ndash; I can read it very easily despite minimal interline spacing. Kudos to Bigelow &amp; Holmes!  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam</div>

Of course not! The numbers are set with a different typeface, not Lucida Console. What you see is Lucida Console regular, and it doesn't have a bold. I would love to have a corresponding Bold that renders 3-pixel stems.  <BR> <BR>&gt; 2) Don't you think it's a little bit wide? <BR> <BR>No, I actually quite like it. In programming, many lines are rather short. A narrow font would make the source code occupy some 1/2 of the screen, while the other half would remain empty.  <BR> <BR>&gt; 3) How do you feel about semi-serifs  <BR>&gt; in a coding font? <BR> <BR>Mmm&hellip; What do you mean? Well, Andale Mono is fine, if you ask me, but should be bolder.  <BR> <BR>Vincent,  <BR> <BR>I hate Courier.

		<div class="commentbody">So Vincent, I guess the colorful fur doesn't bother you? <BR> <BR>Adam, very useful feedback - thank you. <BR> <BR>The semi-serif thing is coming from the need to make some letters fill the width while others are wide enough (or too wide, like the &quot;m&quot;). As far as I can tell virtually all mono fonts have this to some extent, usually on the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;el&quot;. The thing is, when you have too few of them, they make the font less harmonious. That and the need to fill the space make me think that more serifs (often just half-serifs) can help. <BR> <BR>Here's a fake code setting I'd love to hear comments on: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/54374.gif" alt="Coda14R"> <BR> <BR>It's 14 pixels tall (lc). I think it would be the Regular weight, and would get both lighter and darker companions. I can make a 12, but I don't think I should go below that. If I made a 16 (one pixel shorter than the font in Adam's screen grab) I would probably need to increase the width from 9 to 11, or 12. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Rather, results seem to be consistent with rendering to a bitmap with 3x the horizontal resolution, then filtering the result to bring it to an RGB subpixeled image with the worst of the color fringing suppressed. <BR> <BR>If that's the case, then near-horizontal strokes will more closely resemble old-style monochrome TT rendering than Mac OSX-style grayscale. <BR> <BR>I'm not saying they really are going to a bitmap; from what I know of previous generations of the technology, it's most likely that they are going to an intermediate grayscale bitmap (with 3x the horizontal rez as mentioned above), then doing massive contrast enhancement along with the color-fringing filtering. If you read the CT patents, you'll find quite a bit of nonlinear filtering machinery that should be capable of these operations. <BR> <BR>The remaining trick, of course, is to tune everything, and supply the hints in the font files, so that it all looks good. I think MS and its stable of font designers have done that, thanks to their ability to invest massive amounts of time, energy, and money.</div>

This version of ClearType applies font smoothing in the x-direction only, which means that shallow horizontal curves will still be visibly 'stepped'. This is often noticeable in S/s and in some forms of the letter a (e.g. Helvetica). In the Windows XP and earlier versions of ClearType, this was true of all sizes, which is why display-size type actually looks worse in CT than with traditional anti-aliasing, which smooths in both directions. The new version of ClearType, which will ship with Longhorn, applies greyscale anti-aliasing in the y-direction at sizes detemined by the designer in a new gasp table (see page 14 of <i>Now read this</i>). The CT test app I have which  can use sub-pixel positioning does not yet use the y-direction anti-aliasing, so I can't show this very well in text samples. <BR> <BR>Below is a cascade of ppem sizes for the Consolas S, the top line with the current CT rendering and the bottom with the new y-direction antialiasing activated.

		<div class="commentbody">hrant: If the softness of focus is consciously apparent, the resolution of your display is simply too small. It's going to take a while for displays with adequate resolution to penetrate the market. I believe the release of Longhorn will catalyze this due to its planned good support of hi-res displays. When this happens, all advanced font rendering technologies (FontFocus, Cleartype, and the MacOS with RGB subpixelling all count) will deliver sufficiently good results that additional hand tuning is unlikely to be worth it. <BR> <BR>John: what's the best way for me to get a copy of &quot;now read this&quot;?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Cool comparison! Thanks. <BR> <BR>So you're saying that your bottom sample <i>does</i> use y-direction a-a, but cannot yet do that in conjunction with subpixel <i>positioning</i>, right? (This is getting complicated&hellip;) <BR> <BR>Speaking of cascading :-) here are two resultant questions: <BR>1) Do you know why they're only turning on the y-direction now and not since the beginning? <BR>2) To get basically vertical, non-subpixel [rendering] of a-a in a non-y-enabled engine, why not render a 3x2 grid per pixel (instead of a 3x1), and then: do your CT magic in the x direction; but sample it down to grays (in the &quot;normal&quot; a-a way) in the y direction? Performance? Wait a second: I think I might have just described what y-enabling basically is! And maybe if it is a performance issue they were waiting for computers to get fast enough&hellip; <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; the resolution of your display is simply too small. <BR> <BR>1) Yes, but it's also typical of users. <BR>2) For some reason those smaller-size samples you once posted didn't suffer from this. Also: CT doesn't suffer from it, neither does the (more-blurry) MacOS rendering, and in fact I think neither the full-fuzz stuff (like Photoshop). That's why I was saying there seem to be &quot;flavors&quot; of blur; maybe it's due to some parts of your rendering being very crisp and others very blurry? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

They also hadn't figured out how best to apply it. Beat Stamm's first trials turned on the y-direction smoothing at all sizes but made it progressive. But eventually they decided that this should be design-specific, so should be controlled via an update to the gasp table. The latter has not been published yet. <BR> <BR> <BR>Raph, I've afraid I also have problems with your FontFocus example, and my resolution is high (146 ppi). I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, but the symptom is a kind of sparkle. Take a look at the crossbar of the e in the word 'ampersand' for example, there is a loss of both focus and contrast. <BR> <BR>If you sent me your mailing address (to tiro[at]tiro.com) I will pass it along to Geraldine Wade at MS, who can send you a copy of <i>Now read this.</i> There will also be copies in London at Typotechnica in February, for those who didn't get them at ATypI.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Take a look at the crossbar of the e in the word 'ampersand' for example, there is a loss of both focus and contrast.</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, this is because the FontFocus technique really works in the x direction. The issue with the crossbar of the 'e' is that it always perfectly preserves the vertical proportions of the original glyph. Hinting-based techniques will increase or decrease the counter size to get better grid alignment. <BR> <BR>Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing seems to me a judgement call. Obviously, if the overriding goal is maximal contrast, then you want hinting. On the other hand, hinting loses things such as consistency between sizes. Note that the space between the two monocles of the 'g' is considerably larger in the nominal 11pt Consolia than either the nominal 12 or nominal 9. <BR> <BR>hrant: Yes, 100 dpi is universal on desktops, and resolutions higher than 130 dpi or so are rare even on laptops. Over the long term, I think it's inevitable that mainstream displays will reach 200 dpi. It all depends on whether you're trying to solve immediate problems or design for the future; I tend to do more of the latter in my own work, but there's a lot to be said for making users happy now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Adam, are you familiar with the 'developer syndrome'? This is something that was noted by Microsoft in their studies of acceptability of ClearType. Only five percent of people involved in the studies objected to ClearType and reported it as unacceptably fuzzy (even when tuned), but this percentage was higher among a group identified as 'developers', i.e. of programmers and other software developers. The phenomenon is not explained, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact that such people have been looking at text on screen for longer and in greater volume than the typical member of the population at large. So it may be that developers have become deeply accustomed to particular kinds of screen text display, and find anything divergent to be difficult to handle. <BR> <BR>And, of course, you may have particularly acute sensitivity to colour fringing. <BR> <BR>I also find ClearType much less pleasant on 96 ppi screens, but still prefer it to the jaggy letters of b/w rendering.</div>

Only a short while ago MS was justifying turning off a-a (in text sizes) because users were overwhelmingly against it. Although improved algorithms and resolutions can shift things around, it's really hard to imagine such a huge flip-flop. And wasn't Simon saying that that number is actually coming from some highly informal process? Or maybe he was talking about something else. Where's that thread? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, Si's comments about an informal process were in reference to CT tuning preferences. The 5% figure arises out of some of the studies Kevin Larson has been involved with, I believe. My own inclination is to ignore the actual figure, since I don't know how large the sample was (obviously large enough to be classified into separate groupings, e.g. 'developers'), but acknowledge that it is a small percentage, even if one applies typical plus/minus accuracy adjustments. <BR> <BR>MS turned off antialiasing for text sizes in non-CT rendering because it reduced contrast (degraded the notan, if you like). ClearType font smoothing maintains the contrast even at text sizes, so I don't think it is surprising that these two font smoothing technologies would be differently received.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John,  <BR> <BR>yes I chatted with some of the MS guys about the &quot;developer syndrome&quot;. I must say that in some places, I find ClearType acceptable, or even pleasant. For example, in MS Word's reading mode, especially using serif type on white background. But well-hinted pure black-and-white sanserif bitmaps e.g. Verdana, Nina, Lucida Console are unsurpassed for programming, user interface elements and the such. I think CT in my menus is useless, but in the main body of Word it's fine. In other words, I think CT is OK everywhere where it's supposed to simulate printing, but there is also place for distinct screen typography that is more like signage than print. I don't dislike CT on some portions of the screen, but every time I turn on CT system-wide, I'm dreaded.  <BR> <BR>And of course, I've been reading type on screen for the last 19 years (which is 2/3 of my life). So yes, I do have a very strong picture of what screen text should look like. I have a sense that ClearType is NOT very good for long-time reading because it may subconsciously strain the eye. Every time the eye sees something that the brain thinks is off-focus, the eye tries to focus on it. IMO, ClearType may cause this effect. I'm not sure if Microsoft tested how ClearType works in long-time reading.  <BR> <BR>Sergej, I think it is possible that the optics of my glasses may have something to do with it. But Iit's not the particular pair of glasses I wear, I checked different pairs with the same effect. Since I don't really know the world without glasses (started wearing them at the age of 3), I can't really tell if this is the &quot;problem&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's a reference to decisions made in the development of the six new 'western' (Latin, Cyrillic and Greek) types for Longhorn: the MS ClearType Font Collection. So this isn't a 'standard ClearType x-height and linespacing', it is an x-height and linespacing that is common to this particular set of ClearType-specific fonts, which we wanted to work together in such a way that a user could combine them on the same line and not have the linespacing change or the x-height vary too much. Actually, the x-height does vary a bit, but this is more noticeable in print than at text sizes on screen: Constantia has a smaller x-height than the other designs, and Consolas has a slightly taller x-height. Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Corbel have harmonised x-heights. <BR> <BR>I agree that the wording in <i>Now read this</i> is not ideal, because it suggests that these design decisions are somehow standard to ClearType, rather than standard to the ClearType Font Collection.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding screen resolution (or density, to use Adam's distinction), I suspect that the majority of displays, especially for home users, will eventually level out around 133 ppi. Such densities are becoming more common on laptops, and as prices come down they will sell themselves simply because they look so much better in the shops. I share Laurence's skepticism regarding 200 ppi screens, lovely though they are: the demand outside of specialist markets (e.g. medical) is very limited. <BR> <BR>I think that ClearType text on screen will actually be a significant factor in establishing a common screen density higher than 120 ppi. The 'sweet spot' for ClearType rendering is somewhere between 120 ppi and 135 ppi, depending on the individual monitor gamma. At that density, I think most people will have little trouble with fuzz, and you start getting decent serif rendering (i.e. serifs that are not the same weight as the main stems, which turns every typeface into an Egyptian at text sizes). <BR> <BR>One thing that might create substantial demand for higher density monitors is if studies eventually show net benefits in productivity, i.e. faster and more accurate reading times, for subpixel rendering on such displays. Solid data on this could prompt large corporations to invest in such screens. This seems to me more likely than a significant growth in the user of high-resolution monitors by home users.</div>

These screens will reach the general public, simply as a result of competition and the manufacturers seeking broader financing for their technological development. Look at personal computers these days: for an average Office users, 2.5 GHz processors are far too powerful, so new areas of entertainment are created by marketing experts (such as home video editing) and super-multimedia computers are sold to general public so the people get the chance to throw away their old hardware &ndash; which mostly actually works fine. Look at software manufacturers such as Adobe or Microsoft, releasing new versions of their software every year, or two tops. Adobe keeps developing Photoshop although 95% of the the application actually is good enough for 95% of the users. And Acrobat 7 is waiting to hit the stores although many users hardly switched to Acrobat 6 from previous versions&hellip;  <BR> <BR>In a continuous strive for incoming cash, companies need to put out products that offer evident advantages to users, so the users are willing to give up their old products even though they're still functioning.  <BR> <BR>The superiority of a 200 dpi screen is evident: the quality of text is much better, and my guess is that the world is moving towards on-screen reading more and more. Printing and paper is expensive and unecological.  <BR> <BR>The only substantial ship-stopper is that a lot of screen design is bitmap-oriented nowadays. With heavily diverging screen dentisites, it gets more compilcated to design websites, but then again, since high-bandwidth net connections are gaining popularity, it is possible that soon, websites will be designed in high resolution and will be automatically subsampled for low-res screens.  <BR> <BR>Adam</div>

That's where that 5% for <BR>&gt; example is coming from.  <BR> <BR>To clarify: <BR>I don't think a person working at MS is necessarily dishonest*. In fact the few MS type people I have met seem genuinely good; but they only work there. What I was trying to say is that MS (like any other corporation) hires people who are likely to help out their sales. Any opinion about anything is out there, and companies who value money more than &quot;truth&quot;** make it a point to harness what suits them. For example when MS heard Stam give a talk at RIDT about his hinting work in college, they realized it's just what they &quot;needed&quot; and brought him on board. Now that hinting can't generate sales anymore it's been depracated. <BR> <BR>* Hey, I do work for <i>DISNEY</i>&hellip; <BR> <BR>** And the ones that prioritize culture over money do poorly in Capitlastism. <BR> <BR>I have a lot of respect for MS Typography, but that's due to the individuals who are there vying for quality and <i>in spite</i> of the nefarious &quot;parent&quot; trying to drive things its way. As always, it's a tug of war, or an &quot;amour violent&quot;, between individuals and society. <BR> <BR>The same applies at places like Adobe btw. I think Thomas and David are great people who care about type, but in effect they're wrestling with an entity that's driven by shareholders, people who don't give a hoot about anything more than buying that yacht as soon as possible. Well, at least they certainly don't care about type. <BR> <BR>We have to apply this context to understand where specific things (like CT) are really coming from. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Please let me know what you think of it, and whether you'd prefer seeing it paired to a 1-pixel or a 3-pixel cut. <BR> <BR>* I could add a pixel to the x-height (making the font a 15) to equalize the size, but not everybody has Adam's and John's ppi! In fact I'll probably need to make a smaller cut as well - maybe a 13 with 1-pixel stems (and a width of 8 instead of 11).

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comparison Hrant! Mana-13 is very nice indeed. Coda looks interesting as well. <BR> <BR>I look forward to seeing Mana-11 Mono. I'd be willing to make a donation to speed its development if you are willing to target it toward programming (maybe under a different name?). There are some specific things that I would like in a programming font. I'll ramble off some&hellip; <BR> <BR>I like the open bottom of the g. /, |, and \ should extend as high and low as possible. &quot;1lI&quot;, &quot;ji&quot;, &quot;,.;:&quot;, &quot;({[&quot;, &quot;$Ss&quot;, &quot;0Oo&quot;, etc all need to be very unique so they are not easily confused. * should be centered. &lt;and&gt; need to be quite pronounced. The bottom of _ should be aligned with the bottom of the alpha characters. $ should be quite tall (it is used as a variable prefix in some languages like PHP: $foobar). The bold version of the font must be the same character width as the regular. Most TT fonts I try in my editor lose their usefulness as monospaced because the bold is wider than regular. I guess I need a seperate version of the font in bold? Vera Mono comes this way and is one of the few that work. The font should make efficient use of its space, especially in the vertical direction.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Lauri, Nate. <BR>Lauri, don't you think it's too wide for email? <BR>Note that only the lc is actually done*, the rest is only hurriedly modified from Mana glyphs for now. <BR> <BR>* Using the term loosely.  :-) <BR> <BR>I made Coda at 14 first for two reasons: <BR>- It's better to distill the &quot;character&quot; of a bitmap family downwards rather than upwards. <BR>- Adam. :-) Which is why I'm wondering if it's too big for most other programmers. <BR> <BR>Nate, thanks for the offer. I can certainly finish a Coda-11 first, especially if many others think 14 is too big. In terms of weight(s) it would be like Mana-13 above, with the Bold setting at the same width. I'll have to figure out whether it's better to have some bold glyphs be ugly, or have the whole thing wide (like the 14). <BR> <BR>Your list sounds great. Please send it to me in private along with how much you think you should pay: <BR>hrant_thatsymbol_inverselogic_dot_corn <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>The big question is: <BR>Do the serifs intrude more than they help the spacing?

There's an effective upper limit, but it's higher than 133. <BR> <BR>I used to think 1024x768 was plenty, then I  switched to a laptop with a 1400x1024 display.  I recently had to use an older laptop for a few days and the smaller screen was driving me crazy&ndash;both in terms of less ppi and less real estate. <BR> <BR>This also reminds me of my first experience with a serial terminal.  1200 baud was <i>blazing</i> fast; I literally couldn't keep up with it, the end-all and be-all of text display as it were.  Then I switched it to 4800 baud&hellip; wow.  When I switched back to 1200 a few months later, there was no way I could use it&ndash;waaaaay too slow. <BR> <BR>Another thing to consider is the severe restrictions on TV resolution due to bandwidth limitations; only so much bandwidth per station, even on cable.  Given that full-video-over-Internet will be commonplace in the next 2-5 years (sufficient to-the-home bandwidth is finally here) we'll start seeing increasing demands for better quality video.  This will drive demand for higher-res video cameras as well as displays, and consumers will want high-res cameras for playback on their HDTVs. <BR> <BR>Framerate will go the same way, but increasing it  is less noticeable so we'll eventually top out at 100hz.  Resolution will increase before framerate. <BR> <BR>Higher-res still cameras will become popular not because people necessarily want to do bigger pictures, but because they'll offer increased zoom and editing capabilities.  At some point a highres CCD will be cheaper than a quality zoom lens&hellip; there are some interesting technical challenges to overcome and I don't think 6+ megapixel CCDs will be out anytime soon, but it will happen. <BR> <BR>The one thing I do know is, every time I've heard someone say &quot;XXX is more than sufficient&quot;, even if they're correct they still turn out to be wrong <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>
