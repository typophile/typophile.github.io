  body: It looks like the UC &#39;G&#39; has simply been tilted, so that&#39;d  <BR>make
    it a Futura-like font, probably <a href="http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/" target="_blank">
    The Foundry</a>&#39;s version  <BR>of Paul Renner&#39;s original design. Let me

  body: 'Hmmm... their site says: <BR> <BR><i>All the fonts are available in PostScript
    Type 1 for the  <BR>Macintosh fully compatible with Adobe Type Manager,  <BR>and
    in PostScript and TrueType for the PC.</i> <BR> <BR>but there is no inkling of
    a clue where you can purchase  <BR>licenses for their fonts. Talk about bad communication.
    <BR>Does anybody know through which channel you can buy  <BR>Foudrytypes?'
