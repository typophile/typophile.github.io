body: "i am working to find a substitute font for <a href=\"http://www.swankglossy.com/\">swankglossy</a>
  fashion magazine. The font that i want to substitute is Bodoni.\r\n\r\nThe font
  is similar to Didot,and most fashion magazine use this font such as ELLE, VOGUE,
  BAZAAR, etc. I`m trying to find something new, fresh, elegant yet still has a sense
  of fashion in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any thoughtful feedback
  you are willing to share. Please ask any questions you need answered in order to
  respond.\r\n\r\n"

    Jakarta =).saya sudah add Fb mu.Btw web lo bagus. \r\n \r\n@ Ian Party : Yes,i
    like SangBlue, it looks nice, i`ll take it under consideration.  \r\n\r\n@ frode:
    I`ve already looked at Didot Elder.Its a good font but i dislike the arrow on
    the \"S\". Swankglossy`s readers are mostly female age 20 - 30, but some Men do
    read them. Btw thanks for the input. PS: Yes your font looks elegant. =)\r\n\r\n@
    Poms : Dhanke, i really like the wide variation of History, i think its the best
    candidate for now.\r\n\r\n"
