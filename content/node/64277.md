body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nMy brother generated this PNG from \"a font site\" on the
  internet, most likely commercial. I'm stumped. My first guess was something from
  Nick Curtis, but I can't find anything of his that matches. Thanks in advance for
  the help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kit2logopng_5056.png]\r\n\r\n

  body: "Apparently not the first time someone has digitized this design. Steve Jackaman
    claims he saw an Adrian Williams typeface like this. If so, Adrian must have found
    inspiration in Alf Becker's book. See Red Rooster's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/saint-louis-rr/|Saint
    Louis]]. I notice the 'a' is a different style, but otherwise the resemblance
    is startling.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
