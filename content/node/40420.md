  about software for making layout of some mathematical equation?

  body: I am afraid the No.1 choice for setting mathematics is still LaTeX in some
    of its reincarnations. Check, e.g., www.miktex.org. Not too friendly for a newcomer,
    but irreplacable for practitioners who need to set formulas on a regular basis.
    As a computer scientist I can report that more than 50% of researchers I have
    ever met (worldwide) use some form of LaTeX. The second largest user group seems
    to use - oops - MS Word with Equation Editor or some software based on that (or
    extending it). If you want to see an example of REALLY BAD output, give MS Word/Equation
    Editor a try.

    editor. You could check out the new Word 2007 math handling and Cambria Math font."

  body: That's true. Thanks for pointing this out. My experience with MS Word / Equation
    Editor is restricted to all versions till (including) Word XP, then I lost hope
    MS would ever care about maths seriously. Nevertheless, assuming the 2007 Word
    version + Cambria Math improves significantly on the visual output quality as
    you say, LaTeX still needs to be considered. It offers completely different workflow
    with its own pluses and minuses, where the pluses may prove crucial in many types
    of uses. And its quality is proven by time.

    of Word 2008 for the Mac? Will the Equation Editor match Word 2007? Will Cambria
    be bundled? Or is all this still under NDAs?"
