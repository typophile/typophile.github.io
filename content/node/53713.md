    did notice that the 9 feels like it's rotated to the left a few degrees.

    9 is slightly unbalanced (worse when Novena means Ninth!!!).\r\nHere it goes my
    correction. Hope it looks better than the previous version.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Novena_nine_6547.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/novena_89_3999.jpg]"

  body: "To me the \"9\" still feels like it's tipping over.\r\n\r\nAnd the curvy
    serifs on top of VWXY and M, I don't get those. It looks like something heavy
    fell on these letters ;-). Why are the serifs curved on these letters and not
    on any others? \r\n\r\nBut, remember I'm just a beginner in this, so this might
    well be some sort of smart principle I'm just not getting.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just
    realized you may have changed the curvy serifs in your newest version, in which
    case I take that back.\r\nIt'd probably help to have a PDF; the lettershapes are
    kind of hard to make out in this size."

  body: "Thank you, Altaira: you don't need to apologize by no means. I use to read
    your comments and I think they are very shrewd.\r\nI completely redesigned the
    9 and the 6 in this new version, and I guess they look much better than before.\r\nActually,
    all serifs are curvy, but in the A, K, M, N, U, V, W, X and Y I tried a variation
    (dismissed now in uppercases, still in progress for lowercases) by pushing the
    inner vertex up or down accordingly. As you say, it doesn't work well.\r\nSo,
    take a look at this rearranged model (in addition, I'll put a PDF for inspection
    [[http://typophile.com/blog/32203|in my Typophile blog]]).\r\nThanks again, sharp
    buddy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Novena_Typophile_6118.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Marcelo,\r\nI looked at your latest pdf. I'm certainly a beginner as well
    so feel free to ignore everything I write :)\r\nThe overall effect is very nice,
    with the shapes and colour pretty consistent and harmonious.\r\nThere are a few
    things that don't quite look right to my eye. The c looks a bit as if it were
    modelled on the e, and I think the bottom half could curve in more, as it looks
    a bit flat. I like e. I'd make the ear of the g heavier (longer and fatter), and
    perhaps lose some weight off the inside of the upper curve to balance the colour.
    j looks a little incomplete somehow. I think the diagonal leg of the k could be
    lighter. r,s and t are especially good. Maybe try stronger serifs on the z? \r\nAs
    for capitals, the stem of D looks a bit thin compared with the bowl. E and F and
    nice, but I think the lower bar of E could be too far out. The tail of the J is
    very heavy and will look weird if next to a C for example. M could be a bit too
    narrow. Tail on Q is too light I think. S and T look to be different weights.
    \r\nI like your numerals. I suspect 1 will need much heavier serifs and its head
    may need to be wider. 3 and 5 need to harmonise a bit more. 4 looks light. 6 and
    9 may be a bit too wide. 9 needs more space. It also still looks rotated!\r\nYour
    punctuation is pleasant. I think \xA3 may be out of place and need a base like
    your E. \u20AC could be narrower.\r\nI hope that's useful, I'm only making suggestions
    so see what you think and try them out if you like.\r\n"

    weight.</li>\r\n<li>Look at the new 1. I guess it appears more healthy.</li>\r\n<li>I
    put hands on 3 and 5. It was a hard task, but I think they're improved.</li>\r\n<li>My

    it retains its text-setting qualities. If I were to criticise anything, I'd say
    the arm serifs of E and F are a little light. I'd also consider doing something
    to tame the ascender serifs a little, but I guess that's a question of taste.

    might also want to extend the 'r''s bottom serif on the right even more.\r\n\r\nBecause

  body: "Some additional ideas:\r\n\r\n- make B's lower bowl bigger in relation to
    the top bowl.\r\n\r\n- Where bowls come off stems in the caps (BDPR), consider
    using the same \"cupping\" you do for the stem-only serifs. This Goudy sample
    is an exaggerated version of what I'm talking about:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_6375.gif]\r\n\r\nSee
    how the bowl at the top swoops up before it circles down? Without that, your serifs
    (which are rather long) on the left sides of those letters look bent outwards.
    \r\n\r\n- K's leg doesn't look as stable as it should.\r\n\r\n- take another look
    at the humps of m, n, and u. Something's off on the drawing there - I think they
    thicken too fast coming out of the stem? I think that contributes to the topheavy
    sense of m and n that I was addressing before by suggesting heavier bottom serifs.\r\n\r\n-
    your cedilla has an italic slant to it - I'd make it more upright.\r\n\r\nSeek
    opinions from others on these ideas, too - I'm not an expert."
