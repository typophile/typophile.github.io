body: "Hey there! I\xB4m in a conflict with the selection of the typeface for a project
  that I need to do. The project is to design a light bulb pack. We already have the
  design of the pack me and my colleague. I can attach you some samples that I did
  but I\xB4m not totally convinced though of the result. The style is a bit minimalistic
  I could say.\r\nFeel free to make any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,Orestis"

  body: Very nice. I imagine you've submitted now, but it might be good to put the
    specification numbers (lumens, watts etc.) into lining figures as this is normal
    on technical specifications for headings. Also, I would reset the shadow effect
    for "MM" so that the 'shadows' aren't separated from the letters that are supposed
    to be casting them.
