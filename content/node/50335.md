body: "<strong> Fresh from Veer: </strong>\r\n\r\nMontague Script\u2014 A New Brush
  Lettering Font from Stephen Rapp\r\n\r\nMontague Script takes its name from a small
  hilltown of western Massachusetts rich in culture and history. I lived in this beloved
  community for a number of years and it\u2019s where I first began my study of calligraphy
  and lettering.\r\n\r\nWhile most brush scripts take their cue from mid-twentieth
  century samples, Montague Script is a fresh, contemporary alternative. It comes
  directly from lettering written with a #3 sable brush on smooth vellum and is digitized
  with the same sensibility a lettering artist writes with. Montague reflects a dynamic
  interplay between form and rhythm not usually associated with type. Words suggest
  a baseline, yet are not bound by it. Letters vary in size, connect smoothly, yet
  break that connection purposefully as the scribe does intuitively. Beginnings, endings,
  alternates and ligatures come in as needed while you type. Many more alternates
  are available in the glyph palette of most current graphic software. Exuberant swash
  versions of upper and lowercase letters, as well as ligatures can be accessed through
  both the type and glyph palettes.\r\n\r\nMontague Script is a natural for advertising,
  point of purchase displays, packaging and logo design, cards, journals and much
  more. You will be delighted at how well it can dress up a project and how easily
  it sets.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000367#specimen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UMT0000367_P3_4158.jpg]"

    to get all those glyphs to work together smoothly. If you sign into Veer you can
    test it out on a basic level anyway.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    followed by an r - it all looks so fluid apart from that.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
