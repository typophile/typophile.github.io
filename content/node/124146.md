  OTF.\r\n\r\nI've added just the onum feature but InDesign CS6 has activated both
  the \"Proportional Oldtyle\" menu as well as the \"Tabular Oldstyle\" menu.\r\n\r\nIs
  that something InD just does or is there something I've done wrong?\r\n\r\nFeature
  is pretty simple, I've created an onum1 and onum2 class, the feature is simply:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
  onum {\r\n # Latin (default)\r\n  \tsub @onum1 by @onum2;\r\n\tscript grek;\r\n
  \ \tsub @onum1 by @onum2;\r\n} onum;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\nKen\r\n"
