body: 'Hello, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently tracking down a problem I&#39;ve had using
  different versions of Adobe&#39;s ITC Franklin Gothic and was wondering if others
  have had the same problem. <BR> <BR>The current issue: an outside vendor sent us
  a job using Franklin Gothic Book which they had purchased from Adobe. Their particular
  font was created Aug 18, 1995 and modified Feb 5, 1997. <BR> <BR>Our version of
  the font purchased from Adobe does not have a book version. It has a screen font
  named &#34;Franklin Gothic&#34;, created and modified on Jan. 16, 1997. <BR> <BR>These
  different-named versions appear to be the same font.  Anyone know why the naming
  is inconsistent?  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help <BR> <BR>Kristin'

  body: Adobe often updates their faces. <BR> <BR>If you own an old version it&#39;s
    very likely that it also uses old Unique-ID numbers and may cause conflicts. <BR>
    <BR>The best thing is to write Adobe to ask for an update. Even if they possibly
    ask you some upgrade payment, If you are a registered user they may give you a
    more recent version for free. <BR> <BR>A thing to note is that, if they have even
    slightly changed the metrics value the text may reflow. <BR>Check this in your
    layout or design application in which the job is typeset.
