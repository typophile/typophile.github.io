  for its new brach airberlin Turkey*.\r\n\r\nI am aware that airberlin uses its own
  font based on Chalet but they used a new way to write Turkey. I am not sure if this
  is a font at all but I can't rule it out either.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input guys
  and have some happy Christmas days!\r\n\r\nChristian[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unbenannt-2_5312.gif]"
