  of his stencils. \r\n\r\nIt seems like the would  be a common font, but I can't
  find it. I don't even necessarily need the font, even a picture of the letters.
  I would like the exact replica, with stencil bridges and other inconsistencies that
  may be there.  \r\n\r\nThere is a good picture here you zoom in on. http://www.benfranklin300.org/exhibition/_html/5_4/index.htm\r\nThird
  article down,  fig.IV \"Set of stencils, 1781\"\r\nI really like the only labeled
  \"NO.1\" on paper, and the center brass stencil.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRon"

  body: "Wikipedia says;\r\n\"His fonts were greatly admired by fellow member of the
    Royal Society of Arts, Benjamin Franklin, who took the designs back to the newly-created
    United States, where they were adopted for most federal government publishing.\r\n\r\nHis
    fonts all seems to be the standards for what is still used. So I guess these stencils
    are based on his designs. Do either of the two capital script letters in that
    picture look familiar at all? \r\n\r\nI would really like to have an exact copy
    of what Franklin was using. I want it for the stencil bridges and other inconsistencies
    in the cuts of the brass. The actual style of the font is not as important. And
    I'm don't necessarily need an actual font file (it would be great to find) even
    a picture of all the characters.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.\r\n\r\nIs this in
    the wrong section? I was referred here from another font forum, and I fairly new
    to the font game."

    am not sure what it's based on but it sounds like you want something really close.
    That is even less likely. Most type designers are less interested in making a
    copy than interpreting. If you really want something that has all the oddity &
    specificity the thing to do would be to arrange to take scans of the objects (
    the brass or the paper result) & then commission a designer to undertake a conversion
    into digital type.\r\n\r\nThere may also be rights to clear as well."
