  font to add a dramatic touch to a headline (saying \"Are you ready?\"), and was
  wondering if anyone could point out any fonts they'd used previously to achieve
  a slightly intimidating, dramatic look?\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any pointers in new
  directions as I seem to be in a dead end at the moment!\r\nThanks a lot...."
