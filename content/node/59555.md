  body: James, while it will work the way Pieter described, you can just right-click
    on the contour you want to subtrect and select a command from the Contour menu
    :)

  body: Wow, yes, should that be rather "right-click on a <em>node</em> of the contour
    you want to subtract"? Thanks, Yuri.
