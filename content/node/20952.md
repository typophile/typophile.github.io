  dead keen on using it for her stationary. I have looked all over the place trying
  to find it ... it has me stumped.

    body: 'It looks really familiar. I tried modifying AvantGarde and got close. It
      looks like a cross between AvantGarde and a thin version of a sans serif Bodoni...
      which probably means it''s a custom font. '

    the negative stroke.

  body: They are both really close. Peignot Light is very similar. Looking at some
    of the pages on the <a href="http://www.anothermag.com" target="_blank">Another
    Mag</a> site, some of the letter forms are different. i have attatched a couple
    more images showing a few more combos and an example of the lower case.

  body: "Man, this one got me to dig out really old Letraset sample books. I'm thumbing
    through the 1980 edition right now, examining faces like Camellia, Fino, Premiere
    Lightline and a few other \"vintage\" ultra light faces. Wow, there's actually
    quite a few faces in there I would like to see revived in digital form (such as
    Yagi Link Double, Oxford, Magnificat, Company and its later slotted \"Transmission\"
    variant).\r\n\r\nI'm stumped regarding the sample. But fascinated taking a look
    through yesteryear sample books. Ah, the days of rub on type. About the only thing
    I can use my burnishing tool for these days is digging ear wax out of my ears!
    Sorry for the disgusting image. Hehe."

  body: "Sorry to input but the _a_ really bothers me in this example and all the
    other examples I see where the _d_ is merely the a with an ascender. A girl in
    my year won a film poster national competition with some free font she downloaded
    and it had this same awkwardness to it, maybe it's just me though. Can't stand
    it.\r\n\r\nGood luck on finding a match!"

    someone pulled out a reference of this from an old issue of Harpers Bazaar from
    1969... and it was this exact typeface. my best guess is that this is 100% custom
    and that Another Mag just used it as a reference...\r\n\r\ni also went straight
    to my trust old phil's fonts \"homage to the alphabet\" photolettering bible with
    no luck. maybe its flying under the radar but i feel like this one's a custom."

    is entirely aside from my appreciation of the post but ... I am trying hard to
    understand how such a flat affect and inspired artistry plus new fatherhood can
    coexist in the same person. How?\r\n\r\n(I am in the medical profession and so
    know no better description than \"flat affect\". What is meant, though, is an
    almost bored, emotionless demeanor.)"
