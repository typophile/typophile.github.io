body: "Hi, <BR> <BR>I\u2019ve wondered for a while about typeface families that are
  particularly suited for use by non-designers or computer novices. <BR> <BR>Requirements
  might be something like: <BR> <BR>\u2022 decent looking prime marks when used instead
  of quotes <BR>\u2022 good spacing and height when capitals are used together instead
  of small-caps <BR>\u2022 perhaps a low-height set of numerals, that work decently
  well in both lining and text situations <BR>\u2022 a well-matched readable italic
  <BR>\u2022 good performance in home laser or inkjet printing <BR>\u2022 this may
  be too much to ask of the user, but perhaps a couple weights or optical sizes. <BR>
  <BR>Does anyone have suggestions? I don&#39;t want to read anymore Arial! ;&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Thanks"
