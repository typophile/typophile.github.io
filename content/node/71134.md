    let that hear fellow typophile Hanno! He is the creator of this custom logotype

    years ago</a>."

  body: "Ooops! Sorry. I know that is always a risky way to answer, but you must excuse
    my narrow view of the typophile community. I rarely track any threads outside
    of the Type ID Board. I certainly meant no slight to Hanno Bennert.\r\n\r\nIn
    a way, I suppose I have slighted two communities, although honestly I believe
    many non-commercial fonts are comparable quality to many commercial fonts (see,
    I did it again). However techno sans fonts are one of the most popular amateur
    designer projects, and that was the reason for my leaning that way (plus the fact
    that commercial site searches found nothing especially close).\r\n\r\nI will try
    to be more careful in the future.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"

    that his typefaces pops up here. After all, an amateur is, literally, a lover.

    a \"just for fun\" project in the beginning. Rekord has, however, somewhat evolved,
    and is on it's way to becoming a full grown, commercially available family. I
    started a new thread in the sans section a couple of weeks ago:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/71963\r\n\r\nHope
    you like it... :)\r\n\r\nH."
