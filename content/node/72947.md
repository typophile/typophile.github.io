  \ A very exciting project and I'm narrowing down to final concepts and could use
  some input.  \r\n\r\nIn this case I'm mainly looking for which letters don't work.
  \ For example the first \"S\" in Kansas is just awful.  Any others make you mad?

    and maybe the two A's in Kansas could differ a little more, maybe drop the crossbar
    from one of them to leave an upside-down V shape?\r\nBut very nice work, and I
    agree with the first S, I think it should be re-considered. :)"

    playing with colors now and it is killing me!  So hard to avoid going completely
    oddball/cartoon with this.  Thank you for your feedback!  I'm excited to debut
    a finished version of this tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAny other opinions out there?"

  body: "Not a fan of the C (doesn't fit with the other lettering options, no mate)
    and the E and S in DESIGN are just ugly. The outline stroke of the N seems heavier
    than the stroke weight of the rest of the letters (inconsistent). The first and
    ugly third S's also seem vertically stretched.\r\n\r\nI agree with Thomas on the
    K's issue.\r\n\r\nThe overall design seems fun, but it also feels rigid. Might
    just be the grayscale, but might consider adding some other ornamental details
    or shifting the letter tracking/orientation a bit. "

  body: "Thanks Andrew!  I'm not very worried about consistency (obviously) and I'd
    like the K C D & W to not have mates.  I can't really verbalize why but I think
    each of those should have one \"one-of-a-kind\" forms--hopefully ties back into
    the acronym that way.\r\n\r\nHey!  I like that E and S!  Actually I tweaked the
    S some--it's much more fluid and 3 dimensional now.\r\n\r\nStill struggling with
    color concepts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Artwork-2_5648.jpg]"

  body: 'I meant that the C doesn''t have a mate in the words, I understand the difference
    from KCDW, but perhaps one the E''s in WEEK or one of the A''s in KANSAS could
    be set similarly using the dots. '

  body: "Regarding spacing...you obviously want to do it optically, but I can't help
    but notice that KANSAS/DESIGN and CITY/WEEK both have the same number of letters
    which makes me want to at least see an option that works that sort of alignment
    into it. \r\n\r\nAs it is, while KANSAS CITY and DESIGN WEEK are centered at the
    line-level, it looks odd as CITY and WEEK align vertically OK but KANSAS and DESIGN
    look off kilter. \r\n\r\nI'm seeing these as two distinct visual groupings:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;
    K A N S A S\r\nD E S I G N\r\n\r\n and \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C I T Y\r\nW
    &nbsp; E &nbsp;&nbsp;  E &nbsp; K"

    very well too.\r\nI look forward to seeing the colour version!"

    well, the layout of the full word mark is much better and more appealing to the
    eye. :D\r\nThe colour treatments are good, have you tried the lettering in different
    colours? ie, the K in yellow, the C in green etc. Maybe another thing to explore
    when presenting it on a white background.\r\nI love the development so far!"

  body: "Hey tdabner!  Yeah I tried that originally but to me it felt like a public
    broadcasting station or a children's museum, know what I mean?  I really wanted
    it to work and add a little more \"fun\" into it, but with white it's also easy
    to just lay the mark on top of a photograph, which I like. \r\n\r\nI'll post final-final
    usage examples soon but I think this is ready to be deployed! "

    probably right. Damn children's museums.\r\nI do love what you have done with
    the mark, and you're definitely right about white over the top of an image, it
    will stay subtle, but still have a presence.\r\nThe only thing I can think of
    after looking at them again, is maybe the red is a little harsh on the eye, but
    this may just be on screen, and my eyes are a bit hazy today for some reason.\r\nYes
    please show me the final examples when they are ready :) I hope the client likes
    it, seems like a pretty big one to impress, but no doubt your work will win them
    over."

    would also stress the first letters which again would create a quicker link to
