body: "I'm about to have a large amount of text laser cut from plastic. Problem is
  when i create an outline from any font i have in illustrator the outline is too
  detailed for the cutter size (0.5mm). The solution would be a single stroke typeface
  that when i convert to outline would be just 1 line so the laser would only have
  to cut a single line. Does a font like this exist or how can i convert my type into
  a single stroke graphic.\r\nCheers."

  body: "I need a font that when converted into outline in illustrator will it be
    a single path through the centre of the letter rather than the path being an outline?
    Will monoline do this? Is there software to do this? Or a function in Illustrator?\r\nThanks"

  body: "<em>... outline ... will ... be a single path</em>\r\n\r\nThat's impossible.\r\nHowever,
    the \"hairline\" weight of many typefaces were most likely created by \"stroking\"
    or \"parallel pathing\" such a path, so you could contact foundries with that
    kind of type, and see if they can help."

    is an outline."

  body: "Is this what you mean by outline vs path?\r\n\r\nI think AutoCad uses some
    fonts that are just lines that can be easily read by a laser. But they generally
    have a very mechanical appearance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stroked_4700.gif]\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "I was thinking the same thing Ivan. Perhaps a plotter font. It's the same
    concept, just a plotter uses a marker and not a laser.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I assumed
    most cnc machines or laser cutters were programmed based off an autocad mechanical.
    I guess I'm wrong."

  body: "I think the poster is looking for something that would be akin to a stencil
    sort of approach where the counters were handled in such a way that the entire
    outline for each glyph was but a single <em>path</em>. \r\n\r\nNot strictly \"stencil,\"
    since that design approach often includes multiple paths, but that idea. The bridges
    could conceivably be of negligible width, so as to be invisible, but still meet
    the technical requirement being described.\r\n\r\nThat's how I read this.\r\n\r\nBut
    I'm not aware of any existing font of this nature."
