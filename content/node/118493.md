body: What is your opinion on this font? I saw it for the first time on the website
  of a Californian architecture practice. It looks like a combination of Futura and
  Century Gothic to me. I was surprised it is available for free. Or would it be considered
  as lacking authenticity, being an interpretation of the "real" fonts?

  body: "If you care only about basic latin letters, I guess TeX Gyre adventor is
    URW Gothic L; cf http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre from the GUST
    (the Polish TeX Users Group) site:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<strong>Adventor</strong>\r\nThe
    package (<a href=\"http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor/index_html\">download</a>)
    contains the most recent version of the TeX Gyre Adventor family of fonts in the
    PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. TeX Gyre Adventor is based on the URW
    Gothic L kindly released by URW++ Design and Development Inc. under GFL (independently
    of the GPL release accompanying Ghostscript). The Vietnamese glyphs were added
    by Han The Thanh. The Greek (basic) alphabet programmed for the TeX Gyre Adventor
    was inspired by the Kerkis package (<a href=\"http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/\">http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/</a>).\r\n\r\nTeX
    Gyre Adventor can be used as a replacement for ITC Avant Garde Gothic (designed
    by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase, 1970).\r\n\r\n\r\n</blockquote>"

    StackExchange</a> discusses how URW Gothic L, a clone of ITC Avant Garde Gothic,
    came to be TeX Gyre Adventor. According to http://typophile.com/node/55825  Avant
    Garde was one of those <a href="http://www.ep.ph.bham.ac.uk/general/printing/psfonts.html">35
    fonts built into (the first?) Postscript printers</a>. I presume those are the
    35 fonts released by URW and mentioned in http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor/qag-hist.txt/view.
