body: Hi. I've been in the publishing business for 25 years but am about to open a
  doggie daycare. I  sketched up this logo as a rough draft for someone to refine
  on the computer, and now I can't find the font I traced to make it. (I stupidly
  trashed the Word file and now only have the hand-drawn jpeg.) I've gone through
  my font list three times and tried every serif font in there, and none of them match;
  I don't understand this but it's somehow happening. Can anyone tell me what this
  is? Sorry to be so dumb! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/dog_w__ball_logo_5059.png]

    a curved leg on the R and closed bowl on the g):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/baskerville-2/\r\n\r\nStill,
    the leg on the R isn't as curled in Baskerville as it is on your sample, and I
    don't know where that exclamation point comes from....\r\n\r\n"

    Bodoni:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bauer-bodoni/\r\n\r\nSo, do
    you have Baskerville or Bodoni on your system?"

  body: "Thanks for the ideas. Those are close, especially the Bodoni, but not quite
    it; notice for example the flatter serifs on the Ts and the outward curve to the
    serifs on the capital Es (and the bigger bowl on the small e...). The exclamation
    point is very distinctive. (When I saw that I figured it wouldn't be hard to ID,
    ha!) Anyway thanks, I can always go with the Bodoni if necessary. Very odd. Thanks
    for your help though! :)\r\n\r\nPS I just tried it on my email instead of in Word,
    and I think's actually Big Caslon. Except for the exclamation point \u2014 I must
    have unconsciously embellished that while tracing (long with the curviness of
    the R). Thanks again!"

  body: "When a designer traces letters by hand, he/she inevitably introduces slight
    imperfections and variations, so a hand-traced headline is never a dead-on match
    for the type. Curved strokes, thick-thin contrast, and bracketing on serifs are
    especially prone to distortion when tracing letters. \r\n\r\nHere's my highly
    subjective opinion: For the type of business you have, I prefer the informality
    of your handlettered sketch over the more corporate look you'd get if you set
    the words in real type. I might refine the silhouette of the dog a little, but
    otherwise I'd keep it pretty much the way the sketch looks."
