    give ye a bit of feedback anywho. <BR> <BR>f - something wrong with the crossbar,
    too light? <BR>o- seems too heavy to me, sticks out a bit. <BR>k- too heavy as
    well <BR>j - I&#39;d sharpen up the tail a bit, it seems too blunt. <BR>p- the
    bowl is a tad askew, it looks a little odd. <BR>Q- the tail looks like it&#39;s
    flapping in the breeze. <BR> <BR>Overall it is rather cohesive and pleasant on
    the eye.  <BR>Having said this, I didn&#39;t print it out, I&#39;m still waiting
    for the <BR>bloody thing to arrive. '

  body: 'Hallo Christian, <BR> <BR>No criticism about that, looks good, except one
    thing your uppercase D is a bit too consistent and so looks odd. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    you also should think about your uppercase P and R, for my taste they look too
    much like &#34;copy  and paste from the B&#34;.  <BR>You could correct the counterform
    of the P and thicken the Crossbar of the R <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR>
    <BR>P.S.: It is &#34;Joyce&#34; not &#34;Joice&#34;.'

  body: I love the characters &#40;especially &#34;J&#34; and &#34;C&#34;&#41;, but
    the character spacing seems off.

  body: Christian, this looks really nice. <BR> <BR>The <b>X</b> and <b>x</b>&#40;esp.&#41;
    really lean to the left. <BR> <BR><b>c</b>, <b>e</b> - look good in text but look
    like they might be leaning too much to the right. <BR> <BR><b>K</b> - the upper
    arm appears too short and consequently looks like it is falling. <BR> <BR><b>O</b>
    - Looks a little too small and black. probably okay for the <b>Q</b> &#40;though
    i agree with kris that the Q tail looks like it&#39;s flapping in the breeze.
    I like its shape but maybe closer to the form above and moved to the left? <BR>
    <BR>The stomach of the D is cool, but it&#39;s alarming me here. <BR> <BR>In your
    text setting <b>a</b> looks like it has too much space after. Especially <b>ar</b>
    and <b>an</b> but <b>at</b> is okay and <b>al</b>...but then you might not even
    be at this stage yet. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: 'Vanilla transitional, eh? I guess there&#39;s a limit to how much chocolate
    oldstyle I can consume...  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s pretty cool. It seems
    to have some Times and some Rotis in it, but it&#39;s clearly original too. The
    only &#34;macro&#34; thing I&#39;d change is pull in the descenders a hair. Some
    &#34;micro&#34; stuff: <BR>- The &#34;J&#34; seems out of character. <BR>- I like
    the &#34;K&#34;! Very self-assured. <BR>- The &#34;t&#34; needs a stronger right
    side. <BR> <BR>And yeah, the spacing needs mucho trabajo. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'I smoothed out some lumpiness, and added some  <BR>rudementary spacing &#40;no
    kerning yet&#41;. The previous spacing  <BR>was InDesign optical &#40;they tend
    to do better on the sans&#41;.  <BR>Thanks for the comments. I&#39;ve incorporated
    a bunch into  <BR>this version &#40;I even changed the spelling of Joyce--oops&#41;.  <BR>I
    never really liked the Q. It&#39;s too presumptuous for vanilla. <BR>I switched
    it for something a little more appropriate. I&#39;ve  <BR>only got six or seven
    hours in this experiment so far, but <BR>I think I will definitely use it for
    my next paper--I just need  <BR>to add some figures, an italic, small caps and
    more  <BR>punctuation...  <BR> <BR>Hrant--good call on the Times reference. I
    did look at it  <BR>quite a bit. I wanted it to feel a little more up to date,  <BR>though
    &#40;hence, Rotis, I guess, though I wouldn&#39;t have  <BR>thought of that&#41;.

  body: Nice overall improvement. Although the spacing is too tight now - your very
    high stroke contrast puts a strong limit on tightness. <BR> <BR>&#62; Rotis ....
    I wouldn&#39;t have thought of that <BR> <BR>I figured the Rotis angle was unintended
    &#40;or unconscious?&#41;, but check out the &#34;full-serif&#34; cut - some of
    the glyphs &#40;like the &#34;f&#34;&#41; are really very close &#40;but in a
    good way&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Well, for a &#39;vanilla&#39; it sure looks tasty. I really like how crisp
    it feels. The thin serifs do a lot. <BR> <BR><b>s</b> --&#62; Looks a bit like
    it is leaning backward. <BR><b>p</b> --&#62; The bottom of the bowl is too thin.
    <BR><b>k</b> --&#62; The bottom leg is out too far, it seems also might be a bit
    too heavy.  <BR><b>D</b> --&#62; The bottom might be too thin. <BR> <BR>Christian,
