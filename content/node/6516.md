  body: I think it&#39;s Identikal Curvature Rounded &#34;modified&#34;. All the glyphs
    could be very easy to tweak. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48150.gif"

  body: Nope... there are subtle differences... although curvature is very close and
    a very nice font.  It could be a last resort if I can&#39;t find the actual one....
    anybody else?

  body: sorry... I posted before I read what you had written Adriano.... I guess your
    probably right.... it doesn&#39;t get much closer than that.

  body: '[there are subtle differences...] <BR> <BR>Yes, I agree. Even so, I think
    we have exact matches for all the glyphs &#40;100% for the R&#41;except the D.
    <BR> <BR>Would be very surprised if exists another font this simmilar. <BR> <BR><img
