  body: Or is it the new Big Caslon Italic, which Matthew Carter created expressly
    for Wallpaper?

  body: After taking a look at the first issue of their recent redesign, I&#39;m pretty
    sure this is Carter&#39;s new italic. As the editor&#39;s page notes, &#34;Two
    of these [typefaces] -- Big Caslon Italic and Amplitude -- are unveiled for the
    first time in Wallpaper.&#34;

  body: I guess you&#39;re right, as the balls on the lower-case s terminals seem
    rounder in the sample than in the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/caslon-540-italic-and-swashes/">Caslon
    540 Italic and Swashes</a> seen here. However, I&#39;m still incensed at what
    Stuart Sandler reported in another forum here -- that Carter criticized Stuart&#39;s
    Lionel, saying the world already had Futura. Upon reviewing Carter&#39;s work,
    it struck me as a case of the pot calling the kettle derivative. Now, once again,
    viewing the <i>unbelievably</i> slight differences between 540 and Big Caslon
    &#40;which make the gap between Lionel and Futura look like the Grand Canyon&#41;,
    I have to wonder where the hell Matthew Carter gets off saying anything about
    anyone else&#39;s work. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;m not just saying that because I&#39;m
    sore about losing an ID.

  body: Chesh - Carter&#39;s critique of Lionel must be put into proper <BR>context.
    Carter probably was aware of Stuart&#39;s Display type design skillz <BR>and didn&#39;t
    want him wasting time on something that suspiciously veers toward a text face.

    <BR>Or, i&#39;m sure there&#39;s some other logical explanation. <BR>Really, I
    think there&#39;s more to this...

  body: I&#39;m flattered that you notice, BJ. I design &#39;em for a living, so I
    try to pay attention to what&#39;s going on in magazine land. One day, the stacks
    of publications in my office will form an avalanche and crush me -- an occupational
    hazard if you&#39;re a magazine junkie, I fear.
