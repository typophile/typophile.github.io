  relaxing and inexpensive hobby.\"\r\n\r\nI am thinking to start off with the topic
  of Machines vs Humans. Then I will move to <strong>advancement in digitalization
  of Calligraphy</strond>, <i>But the problem I am having is that I dont have enough
  material. I need help in this topic.</i>\r\n\r\nAfter that I will be talking about
  <b>Typefaces</b> and after that I will cover the topic of <b>Language</b>... and
  then I will come to Digital Calligraphy in Arabic/Persian/Urdu(as they all are of
  same kind.\r\n\r\n<strong>I want to know that what should I say in the advancements
  in digitalization of Calligraphy, and how it is more effective.</strong> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    There are a <em>lot</em> of books on Arabic calligraphy, many of them very good.
    Unfortunately there are very few books on Arabic typography, and most of them
    not very good or even accurate."
