  body: "This page looks like it comes from a specimen book by either Societ\xE0 Augusta
    or Nebiolo, two Italian type foundries. The latter acquired the former at some
    point during the beginning of the XX century. Keep in mind that in those days
    it was pretty common for typefaces to be copied from one foundry to the other
    and I\u2019ve seen many instances in Nebiolo and Augusta specimens where they
    either copied foreign typefaces or have been copied themselves. So the typeface
    itself might or might not have been an original.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell I
    don\u2019t think this particular typeface has ever been digitized, and it sure
    doesn\u2019t have any relation to the Franklin we are used to, Franklin Gothic
    by Morris Fuller Benton. That\u2019s about all I know at the moment, I\u2019m
    afraid."
