  have its World Premiere at the <a href=\"http://www.sxsw.com/film\">South by Southwest
  Film Festival</a> in Austin, Texas, on March 13th. I'll be there to answer questions
  and buy drinks, along with a few designers from the film, TBA. There will be two
  more screenings of the film at SXSW later that week, and then screenings at other
  film festivals museums, colleges, and design conferences. We'll be posting our preliminary
  <a href=\"http://www.helveticafilm.com/screenings.html\">screening schedule</a>
  later this week, and planning another 100 or so screenings worldwide for the next
  few months, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\nThanks to all of you on Typophile for all your
  help. Look for the Typophile \"thanks\" in the film's credits!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Gary\r\n"

    I will join the mailing list and hope for the best concerning a second screening.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the panel discussion seems to have been moved to the day following the screening...
    How will the admission for that be handled? And will the second screening have

    the West Coast premiere of the movie. From what I can tell it's not even the 2nd

    Quite the opposite. Instead it was new thinking and addressed the typographic
    needs of the sans in a direct and unmediated way. That was and is its strength
    as I see it. I am not saying that Meta is some kind of ultimate golden standard*
    but it seems like an especially well known face that also clearly works exceptionally
    well - and specifically as a result of thinking outside of the box Martin sets
    up. It also represents a certain point in Type history when the frame for thinking
    about all of this shifted away from Martin's model. At least it seems this way
    to me. \r\n\r\n*Actually there are myriad examples but I don't want to leave anyone
    out.\r\n\r\nAbout the italics: When you say it's about the slant, what angle (
    or range of angles ) seems more in the ideal range to you? I am keen on the slant

    one of the best new digital text and sans faces, which is saying a lot. I don't
    however remember seeing the sans used as a companion to the serif, so I'm not
    sure how it well it works, though both can work well on their own. \r\n\r\nAs
    to the principle of the thing, I don't don't agree that it's a principle. To me,
    it's  just a matter of what the designer can manage pull off. If you can pull
    off a really good serif and sans and have them work together, that's great. As
    I remember, Stephen Coles did a list somewhere of families with both a good serif
    and sans, and there are surprisingly few. Scala is one of them, maybe the premier
    one, so hats off to Martin Majoor. \r\n\r\nHowever, people also successfully match
    serif text fonts with different sans headings all the time, so no, I don't see
    that it's a requirement or inherently wrong just to do a sans independently. Many
    experienced (i.e., not me) type designers say that the chances of success are
    much greater with a clear brief, and that seems to me enough--I don't see why
    it should be inherently worse than designing a serif first. Eg. Frutiger, designed
    for Charles de Gaulle airport is fabulous and didn't have a serif first. \r\n\r\nPs.
    \"It's all over the place\" doesn't quite capture it, because she is quite systematic.
    She chose a certain logic to the different slants and made it work.  "

    mistake of thinking that there is *one* best way to do things in type. \r\n\r\nNow,
    there are definitely *better and worse* ways of doing italics. The sloped roman
    of Romulus--otherwise great face--is to my eyes a failure, in that it is dull
    and lifeless by comparison to the roman, and thus also is weak as an emphasis
    companion for the roman.\r\n\r\nBut Perpetua's italic, which is largely a slanted
    roman, with the only 5 italic forms in the lower case and 2 in the upper--and
    some additional shaping of bowls--is wonderful.  \r\n\r\nMajoor's idea of designing
    a serif and then a companion sans I suspect is a very good idea. \r\n\r\nBut I
    don't get how this is related to the issue of the italic. After all, the italic
    is a different alphabet than the roman. His argument that Helvetica should have
    had an italic based on Walbaum Italic because it was based on Walbaum I don't
    follow at all. It might work, but it might not. The eye is the arbiter, not a
    pedantic view of what historical precedent needs to be followed and what not.
    \r\n\r\nI am all in favor of being inspired by theory to try new things--theory
    as inspiration. But when theory becomes doctrinaire, limiting possibilities, I
    think it can be harmful. \r\n\r\nps. Majoor's analysis of how following the skeleton
    of the high-contrast Walbaum with a relatively mono-line sans resulted in excessively
    closed forms is right on. And the quote from Paul Rand is great. "

    when you say that it's a different alphabet you mean that it's forms are distinct.
    That seems like an easy observation to agree with. \r\n\r\nHrant, when you say
    it's not a beneficial point of view you are just getting at the idea that the
    sloped roman aught not to be dismissed utterly & dogmatically correct? Or are
    you saying that what's wrong with 'real' italics is their greater afinity of form
    with their chirographic roots? Or both perhaps? Anyway what is it that you are
    getting at?\r\n\r\nI think Martin doesn't support his thory well enough because
    his prescription of following  a serif ( while it looks bang-on in terms of a
    speculative history of the root of helvetica's forms ) did also result in the
    closed forms he so rightly criticises. What I am saying is that his example seems
    to argue against his alter assertion rather than supporting it. He might argue
    that a more suitable serif would result ina better solution but I think Erik Speikermann's
    approach not to leave out Andre Gutler's Haas Unica seems far closer to the ideal.
    \ \r\n\r\n<cite> Skeletons are for biology students. </cite>\r\n\r\nWhen you say
    this I wonder about the broader picture of how a sans would be used. Martin   is
    thinking in terms of a serif & sans family. I have been thinking in terms of a
    serif on it's own. Probably if you want to make a matched set of families paying
    some attention to 'skeletons' could have some degree of value as a starting point
    if not as a determanistic model. But I am not sure I like the idea of matched
    families all that well. It seems like matching different faces gives a more plesant
    complex and resonant result provided it is done well.  "
