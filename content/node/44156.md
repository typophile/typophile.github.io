body: I am going to the SF Rare Book Room in the main Library at 10 to look at original
  Aldus books and other wonderful stuff. Come see what treasures you have in easy
  reach (if you live here). Most likely I will be there until 6pm with a break for
  lunch.

    Aetna</em> yesterday here at Yale. It's actually for a newspaper article that
    I'll be designing, which I'll post on my Typophile blog Monday when it comes out.
    Enjoy yourself!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that the newspaper article's on
    Matthew Carter's reinterpretation of Aldus' work, the Yale typeface."

  body: "No, actually, as far as I know I wasn't allowed to take photos on my own.
    But I'll eagerly await your images.\r\n\r\nBTW, I've been reading your posts on
    contextual alternates, and I looked for them a bit in <em>De Aetna</em>. I wish
    I had seen your Jenson thread where James Mosley chimes in before now so I could
    have been on the lookout for contextual alternates more than I was. I saw the
    accented e's with oblique eyes and the swash e's and m's, but I'll have to go
    back to check out the others Mosley shows."

  body: "I am not sure and I think James is also not sure there are contextual alternates
    in De Aetna yet. SF didn't have a De Aetna to check. What I think I did see was
    that Aldine books do seem to have more than one shape of many glyphs and over
    time they are used less contextually - more randomly. The opposite is also true
    that early Aldines seem to be more consistent in their patterns of glyph use.
    But I need to see more to be able to be sure and it would be good to be able to
    go through and show each instance and make a proper counted survey. You should
    remember that he finishes his post by saying \"I remain to be convinced.\".\r\n\r\nI
    think I may be able to convince him. We shall see. May I am wrong. I will be posting
    images before long & hopefully we will get lots of informed opinion on the subject."

    Collections</a> at Brigham Young University has a very large collection of Aldine
    books. If memory serves they have a De Aetna. (A few minutes later.) Perhaps they
    only have a version by Mardersteig. '

    from the one I saw last week."

    need to get really close which requires special optics.\r\n\r\nLike this ( this
