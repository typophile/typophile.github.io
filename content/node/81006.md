  body: I hadn't heard of Donovan Winter until today but I see his films were made
    between 1962 and 1978. I'm not sure of an exact match, but [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/arab-brushstroke/|Arab
    Brushstroke]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/amber/|Amber]] are both in
    this style of casual brush lettering. Your sample could be a Filmotype or PLINC
    face.
