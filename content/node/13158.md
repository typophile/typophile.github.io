body: "I found my CD.  its been through hell and back, so bare with the image.\r\nAccording
  to last thread (Funky Courier Similar to Rough) many users thought the type was
  hand lettered.\r\n\r\nI don't think the type is hand lettered because the type is
  used in the liner notes fairly frequently.  So lets take another stab at it.\r\n\r\nThis
  time with better photo reference."

  body: "The reason people think it's hand-lettered (and I still do) is that the characters
    are not consistent. It is possible that the entire thing was done by hand.\r\n\r\nLook
    at the two l's in collection for example.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that someone
    typeset this initially using an existing font and then traced over it by hand
    to get the rough effect."

  body: "Hey, I think those two \"l\"'s appear different because I spilled silk screen
    washing chemicals on my source art and the type got distorted when the image dried.\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at other characters on the recto side such as \"e\", \"r\",\"n\", \"s\",
    and \"a\" they appear the same throughout, plus or minus spacing. Look at \"Manu
    Dibango\" and \"Mamba Percussion\". Also look at the numberals.  Those letter
    forms are more similar than unique.  This is clear when looking at the type with
    a magnification lense.\r\n\r\nThe irregularity is mostly because my source art
    is warped.\r\n\r\nI think the quest to ID this typeface is still on.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your input Patty Fab(ulouso)!\r\n\r\nBookie"
