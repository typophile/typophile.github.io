  font ANNONCE  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/ for the logotype
  part of it. I'd like to use a script for a monogram as a symbol to accompany it.
  Does anyone have any suggestions? Canada Type, the maker of Annonce, has some decent
  scripts to use with it, but I haven't seen anything I love yet. The letters in the
  monogram are H and G if that's helpful. Thanks!"

    based on actual monogram designs.

  body: As Riccardo points out most Monograms are hand done - art not a font. That
    said, you can use glyphs from several fonts (combine) to produce an interesting
    and original monogram.

  body: If you're talking about a preppy monogram, just google around. Some of the
    circle monogram fonts even have greek support (for sororities). There's a lot
    of modern geometric monogram fonts, for the traditional kind try Monogram KK or
    Vine Monogram. There's also my own design [[http://www.dafont.com/free-monogram.font|Free
    Monogram]] which is GPL.
