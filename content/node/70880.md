  body: "Frederic W. Goudy designed a large number of typefaces during his career.\r\n\r\nSome
    of them have been redrawn by others when they were made available in digital form.\r\n\r\nThere
    is, however, one group of typefaces bearing his name about which there is reason
    for confusion. Goudy Old Style was designed by him, but then he left American
    Type Founders, and they created a number of variations of this very popular typeface
    without his involvement. That is the only situation I am aware of where there
    is serious confusion about the design of a typeface with which his name is associated."

  body: "The complete list of FWG typefaces can be found at Goudyfonts.com but he
    did, indeed design each in your list. \r\nOldStyle and oldstyle italic were created
    for ATF and ATF further expanded it to include additional weights. Not sure what
    Goudy STD is. Text is a blackletter design - one of the best IMHO. Heavyface is
    a very bold display face. Modern is one of his best text faces - not really 'modern'
    in the sense of what most modern types are considered (like Bodoni or Didot).\r\n\r\nI
    hope that helps\r\nSteve"
