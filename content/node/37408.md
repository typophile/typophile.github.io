  body: "rockberto - all of these ID requests will get confusing to keep track of
    unless you start naming your threads properly (check the FAQ). For instance, this
    one could have been called something as simple as \"Nostradamus ID\" which would
    have been infinitely more useful than \"an other help\".\r\n\r\n - Lex"
