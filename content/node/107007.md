    Mini]]  would be the most appropriate tool for what you want to do. It's a good
    balance of affordability, features, and ease of use.

    install for mac - http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/downloads/mac/ - and a similarly
    easy version for Windows is coming our soon :) \r\n\r\nNot only is is the most
    affordable - zero price - it is libre software, so you can participate in its
    development at github.com/fontforge/fontforge :) "

    which you can import .SVG files from Illustrator (probably the least expensive

    - as they all have their own merits/disadvantages, costs, feature lists and learning
    curves.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nI fully agree. Since the mid 1980s I have worked with
    different font production tools; \uFB01rst IKARUS and not much later Fontographer.
    In the course of time I have seen other applications being developed and, of course,
    together with URW++ we developed our own suite of font production tools. \r\n\r\nOur
    tools \uFB01t our needs best, because they were tailor-made for us. That doesn\u2019t
    imply that this is the case for others too. I think it\u2019s quite human to think
    that the tools one uses are the best, and often it looks to me that users of a
    certain tool want to convince the rest of the world that their tools are the best.
    If other people follow you, they prove you are right. And people often like to
    be part of a community. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically
    this is not a problem, but in case a monoculture is developed in education, i.e.
    education based on one speci\uFB01c tool,  this is wrong IMHO. And I have seen
    this happen and this resulted in replies from students when I showed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOsYMctPRNg\">functionality</a>
    not covered by their favorite tool, i.e. their lecturer\u2019s, preferred tools
    like: \u2018<em>Okay, we will wait until this will become available for the tool
    we use.</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps
    circumventing limitations is \uFB01ne if you have more time than money, but from
    a production point of view it makes sense to combine tools then (for drawing,
    for generating fonts, for adding OT Layout features, etc.). Or even switch to
    another tool. So, in education <em>all</em> tools should be discussed.\r\n\r\nRamiro:
    \u2018<em>FontMaster (A bit outdated and not user friendly IMHO)</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    I\u2019m a bit biased, but I think the FM is actually quite user-friendly and
    not outdated at all. FM uses a nice versatile \uFB01le system, has a lot of powerful
    batch-functionality built-in (for instance the OT Layout features subsetting is
    <strong>very</strong> user-friendly), has very good autohinting capabilities,
    and IMHO a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6qOc6Ktzds\">nice interface</a>
    for drawing glyphs (but, as mentioned above, it was mostly tailor-made for DTL).
    Also the (batch) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WNDdGu9Pqg\">autotracer</a>
    is excellent. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FM supports
    the IKARUS format, which may not be important to you, but it is for (very) large
    software companies which use our tools still (especially in the Far East). And
    FM is the only tool available that offers manual digitizing with a tablet, as
    far as I know.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you compare it with your favorite tool, then
    perhaps FM has a steep learning curve because it handles things differently. And
    if you want a native Mac OS X version, you will have to wait for the new edition
    (see the \uFB01rst link above). And if you\u2019re a novice and you\u2019re not
    thinking of handling many font files, then FM is perhaps not the best choice.
    And in case you want to apply deltahints, FontLab Studio is the only application
    mentioned here that offers this option.\r\n\r\nRamiro: \u2018<em>There other less
    powerful (but easier) options like: - Fontographer</em>\r\n\r\nWell, if you combine
    Fontographer with DTL OTMaster, you have a very powerful combi. Generate a glyph
    database in Fontographer (using its quite good drawing capabilities), generate
    an OT Layout features \uFB01le in OTM (with the forenamed subsetting), and combine
    this in Fontographer. Or add colored glyphs using OTM. \r\n\r\nAlan: \u2018<em>You
    might want to think about and tell us what other features you require (and will
    require in the future), whether cost is a factor etc - otherwise this thread is
    probably not much help.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nYes, de\uFB01ne your needs \uFB01rst.

  body: "If you're working on Windows, FontCreator has changed a lot recently. \r\nIt
    was once totally TrueType centric but not so anymore. OTF is well supported.\r\nIt
    opens and exports to the WOFF format quite nicely.\r\nIt's got ttfautohint 9.5
    built in.\r\nIt's got it's own project format now.\r\n\r\nAnd AFAIK, it's the
    only editor that supports Microsoft's Color Fonts spec. \r\n\r\nI very much like
    it for some things - working with composites is sometime easier in it. And I like
    the interface. I wish other font editors were as friendly.  (This is, for me,
    the major sticking point about FontForge. It's a very capable program but visually
    I'm repulsed by it. It doesn't reveal what I need to see, easily.)\r\n\r\nIn my
    experience - no one tool has it all.  And I agree with Frank that that's a healthy
    thing. \r\n\r\n"
