  get the juices flowing.\r\n\r\nThis is a logo for a cabinetmaker who does a wide
  range of high end pieces: humidors, large dining tables, custom desks, built-ins,
  kitchens, etc.  His designs range from staid, traditional pieces, to art deco and
  ultra-modern.  His process involves the collaboration with many shops, so he has
  dubbed his brand, \"Whelan Artisans.\"  He wants to give the idea of traditional
  craft that is also forward-looking and sustainable, and suggested two whales in
  a circle formation.\r\n\r\nHere is my initial treatment.  He liked Garamond, although
  I have my misgivings about it.  Also, I modeled the animal after a blue whale, although
  I'm thinking a humpback might be more dramatic.  I haven't invested a huge amount
  of time, but I would like some initial impressions.  And don't be bashful about
  ripping into it.  That's why I'm posting it - to be refined in the typophile fire.\r\n\r\n-

    how?\r\n\r\nAs is, the lack of line-weight changes in the whales bothers me -
    looks computer-y and decidedly unartisanal.  However, if it's meant to be an outline
    for carving into wood, that's a different story.\r\n\r\nThe big W bothers me,
    especially with the logomark - the styles of the mark and the logotype seem way
    to different.\r\n\r\nSo... Whales?  Whelan?  Is that the connection?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
    for sharing your logo-in-process!"

    two whales is certainly memorable. I like it.\r\n\r\nI agree about the line weight.
    Could you try mixing the line weights? Maybe use two weights similar to the type.\r\n\r\nI'd
    also like to see it sans 'artisans'. Seems unnecessary. "

    I do think the whales offer an elegant negative space between them that works

    goofy smile, which is incongruous."

  body: "First off, thank you everyone for your very helpful comments.\r\n\r\n@eeblet:
    \ Your advice for working with line weights is well taken.  I started from a sketch,
    but midway through the digital process I did sense that humpback whales might
    be better and if this direction turned out to be garbage, I didn't want to have
    spent precious time fine-tuning lines for a direction I would ultimately abandon.
    \ Also, the whale : Whelan link is coincidental; should I steer the client away
    from what may possibly come across as a hackneyed phonemic association?\r\n\r\n@Paul,
    BigWave: Basically, the client really likes whales, and he's kind of a crunchy,
    Grateful Dead type of guy.  I think it suits his personality well, and since partly
    he's selling himself with this logo, I think it fits.  His shop is in Northern
    California (about 2 hours north of San Francisco) and there is a considerable
    amount of whale-watching in the coastal part of the county, so I think the whales
    make sense geographically as well.\r\n\r\n@ellason: \x10Yeah, I notice the goofy
    smile, too.  If you ask me, that's the problem with these damned porpoises; (to
    me, at least) they all look like that have a stupid grin.  Again, another reason
    to try out a humpback whale, since they have less of a scoopy, smiley thing going
    on up front.\r\n\r\nI'll return once I integrate and elaborate.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

  body: "Our school is called the Nantucket Whalers and with the whaling industry
    history here we see lots of whale logos, most commonly the tail coming out of
    waves. I like the fact that you aren't using a wood plane or other similar item
    for a wood worker's logo. I also like having two whales since you are talking
    about more than one person. I don't like the type choice. I think it is too stiff
    for an artisan, especially the W. I think the questions about how this will be
    used are important - wood cuts? letterpress? \r\n\r\nSharon"

    logomark - not logically associated, but it doesn't matter.  Distinctive and nice
    are more important.  The logotype, however, has got to chance, *especially* for
    NorCal, I think.  Something more humanist or even hippy-ish (just a tad - no Hobo)
    would make the whales more sensical.\r\n\r\nI am excited to see what you come

    more modern sans type, or traditional, Venetian serif?  If they mean the latter,
    I agree; if they mean the former, I don't.  The mark needs to communicate a sense
    of time-honored craft, which fits more with the Venetian-style humanist fonts,
    if you ask me.  Any opinions?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    look to a font. Closely associated with humanist sans-serifs which are different
    than the rigid, mechanical forms of Geometric and Grotesque Sans-Serifs.\r\n\r\nIn
    this instance, they're probably referring to a font that has more personality,
    than the cold, mechanical face you've used. While the face you choose does retain
    at timely classical, almost regal style, it's not very personable."

    redid the whales based on a humpback whale.  I think they came out much stronger

    box to give a sense of what a wood imprint might look like.\r\n\r\nHere are links

  body: Kind of hard to tell which way is up with the new whales. I agree with eeblet
    - C or D letters are best; maybe I'd give C the edge because the "carved" look
    they have seems conceptually closer to woodworking to me than the "written" look
    of D.

    one way of unifying the two would be to add some treatment to the crossbars of
    the 'H' and 'A' to bring some of them smooth abstract lines in to the typography
    to have more of a unity between the two.\r\n\r\nThat said, it certainly has the
