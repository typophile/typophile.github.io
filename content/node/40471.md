  For whatever reasons, I'm partial to 1914.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I noticed in looking at inscriptions in New York on buildings that pre WWII
    a lot of dates on buildings used the descending 9, but the others without ascent
    or descent. The makers obviously felt free to do whatever would look good. '

  body: 5.  This is going back a while, of course, before my time. I think 5 is the
    most elegant old style numeral, if done well.

  body: "I like years that have both ascenders and descenders in them. The 1980s and
    1990s were good for that, although I didn't like the repeating \"9\" so much in
    the 90s. Unfortunately, the last such date was 1998, and we won't get another
    one until 2036. I hope to still be around for that one.  :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
