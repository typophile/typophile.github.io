body: "Looking for three fonts from these images. From Reading (the yellow one), the
  font that 'AUGUST BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND' is written in, plus the one used for band
  names (not the ones that have their own logo, obviously - ones like Deftones, Jimmy
  Eat World etc). From Download (the black one), the font used for 'MAVERICK_AC'.\r\n\r\nI
  like making fake posters with line-up predictions, and want to make them as realistic
  as possible using the correct fonts and everything. Had trouble finding a good match
  though, I'm a bit of a noob at typography..."
