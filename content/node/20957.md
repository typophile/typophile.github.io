  body: For the youngins like me in the group, can we see examples of lettering with
    broad nib pens? I'd like to try at least a few characters if I could get headed
    in the right direction. When you say 72pt, is that measured by the cap height?
    ie x height would then be ~36-40 pt? (I figured I would design it at that size)

  body: "Hi David,\r\nbefore you start filling your pen make sure it's not a <strong>broad
    nib</strong> pen but a <strong>pointed</strong> pen, as it says above.\r\n\r\nPointed
    pens produce something similar to <strong><a href=\"http://www.zanerian.com/ZanCertificates.html\">this</a></strong>,
    although these are extreme examples. You could also have a look at Bodoni italic
    for an example of the style that is asked for."

    at the moment is sitting at the lake. Drawing five @-alternates is okay \u2013
    designing a pointed nip pen italic, that's too much at the moment."

  body: very nice! Is there anyway we can have like the next three battles listed
    in advance so people can start on them early if they wish to compete? And a showcase
    for past battles? (lemme know if i can help out in anyway).

  body: "Quick question from a Typophile.com newbie:\r\n\r\nWhen entering these battles
    does one create his work into a font program like Fontlab or are the images posted
    simply mock-up type settings produced in a Illustrator (or similar)?\r\n\r\nI
    would love to enter some ideas in future battles but have yet to stepped up to
    full on Fontlab skills. \r\n\r\nSorry if this information is posted elswere. In
    love with this site."

    rasterized png-file looks like, rather than how it was created.\r\n\r\nI prefer
    fontlab from scratch for this task, because I like the vector-tools better than
    the ones of Illustrator for font-works.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Outlook: How you produce the the designs is up to you, unless the rules of
    a particular battle suggest you do otherwise. As Sebastian mentioned, what is
    important is that you upload the design as a PNG. \r\n\r\nI'd guess most people
    are working in Illustrator (or an equivalent), or maybe a combination of AI and
    Fontlab (that is, if you are like Christian, master battler, and building functional
    fonts every time). Drawing entirely by hand and using a scanner is also an acceptable
    method. \r\n\r\n"
