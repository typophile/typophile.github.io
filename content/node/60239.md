  body: "There seems to be some distortion in your image. Is this printing on fabric?\r\n\r\nThe
    A is unusual for two reasons: it has the half top serif, and it has almost no
    serif on the right leg. The closest A I have found to this is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/hiroshige/|Hiroshige]],
    but it doesn't seem to be a very close match for other letters like the R and
    T. Another calligraphic serif is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-tiepolo/|Tiepolo]],
    but I can't say that's a clear match either.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have any ideas?\r\n\r\n-
