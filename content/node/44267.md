  (or, rather, retro) logo</a> which, at least temporarily, abandons the trademark
  green color for a coffee brown, and harkens back to the company's 1971 origins.\r\n\r\nIn
  addition to attempting to induce nostalgia for the chain's early days, the change
  also heralds the return of founder Howard Schultz to head the company.\r\n\r\nThe
  new version of the old logo has been reportedly \"sanitized\" to remove such lurid
  details as the twin-tailed Greek mermaid's navel, and in the lady's 2006 release,
  her hair was lengthened to cover other \"indecencies\".\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"
