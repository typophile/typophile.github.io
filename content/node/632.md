  will have to say something about those stars, but I will risk this post anyway.

  body: the little little stars are very blurry, maybe you should bypass the star
    idea altogether cause they dont look good this way... so stressed. <BR>and about
    the o, why dont you mark the details of the bottom leg in white? like inverting
    the colours between the two &#34;legs&#34; &#40;whatever they are called&#41;

  body: 'I really do not want to avoid the stars completely. One of the reasons is
    that the agency&#39;s main office will be situated in the cinema centre and I
    would like to make a association to &#40;movie&#41;stars. But I have to agree
    with Alex about the blured stars when they are too small. So I tried to replace
    some of the most delicate by dots.  <BR> <BR>I am presenting four more versions
    now. I was thinking about making windows on the flying saucer. First I thought
    that legs won&#39;t be necessary then, but now I am thinking about canceling the
    windows idea. <BR> <BR>Some questions: <BR>Christoph &#62; What purpose could

  body: I keep seeing hood / roof / top / Apex??? of the saucer as a lowercase c...
    is anyone else having that problem??? so as far as that goes, &#40;reading UFC&#41;
    I think I like the top of the saucer should be either closed complely &#40; no
    breaking space&#41; or rotated so that it doesnt appear as a c....  <BR>Afterall,
    someone looking for the Ultimate Fighting Championship would be pretty disappointed
    when they found out it was a travel agency.. <BR>As far as the stars go, I dont
    think they  really fit with the rest of the design, sorta look like an afterthought....
    I get the whole movie star thing since you explained it, but that may be a bit
    too cryptic for someone just looking for a travel agency.... maybe if you replaced
    them all with the planet dots????? and moved the swoosh form up a little higher
    so they are symmetric to the diagonal axis of the pod..... <BR> <BR>I honestly
    think it would be okay without the stars though..... are they going to want any
    sort of text below the logo on signage??? <BR> <BR>Also I liked the initial grey
    that you used better than the solid black....its reminds me of the moon, or maybe
    the sleek polished metal you imagine spaceships to be made of

  body: Thanks Andrew for that teleporters. Now I see what you&#39;ve meant. And,
    yes, of course there is too much alien abduction suggestion in it. My intention
    was to make a funny logo with a smell of sci-fi films of the fifties and sixties.
    This X Files feature might scare most of the possible turists. But I like your
    drawings so much and I appreciate how much of your thoughts my project deserved.
    But of course I accept yours and Chris&#39;s suggestion about all-dot-logo. I
    made my own &#40;very similar to your suggestion&#41; version. And I changed the
    lower leg a bit &#40;the legs seemed too similar, I think&#41;. <BR> <BR>Chris,
    it is really good you&#39;ve spoted that UFC. It seems nobody elese &#40;incl.
    me&#41; did. It really made me think, so, as you can see, I changed the position
    of that blank space in the upper circle/roof/... Hehe, I really wouln&#39;t like
    to disappoint those who would expect the Ultimate Fighting Championship... About
    grey colour - I am worried about your screen since there was no grey colour in
    my posts &#40;or do you maybe own a monochrome display&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks Tanya,
    at least one, who likes the legless version, but everyone &#40;inc. my client&#41;
    say that it looks like a car wheel. So I have to cancel it, even it maybe could
    look good. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13071.gif"

  body: I can&#39;t say I like the Baker swwosh solution, but I do prefer the way
    the dome of the spacecraft is a completed elipse. The &#34;C&#34; shaped dome
    has always looked a bit &#34;nippley&#34; to me, and this solution does help the
    &#34;O&#34; reading. <BR> <BR>Reviewing all the logos, I am beginning to be bothered
    by the thickness of the double outline within the inside of the &#34;U.&#34; I&#39;m
    not sure how to solve it. Perhaps the lower leg &#40;of the ship&#41; balances
    it a touch when it is black, but I do prefer the versions where the lower leg
    has white definition. <BR> <BR>Does the swoosh make the logo more vertical than
    it needs to be? What will by the applications? Sign? Web site? Letterhead?

  body: I like the idea of rotaing the mark in space, as it were; it feels much more
    other-worldly hovering like that. <BR> <BR>Integrating the type into the mark
    is &#40;almost&#41; always a bad idea. It immedaitely limits the versatility of
    the logo in terms of scale. I.E. the&#34;travel agency&#34; type becomes illegible
    when the logo is reduced even to a reasonable size. Also, reversing the type out
    of the beam is a bit contrived, no? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest letting &#34;UFO&#34;
    just be on its own - it&#39;s much more confident representation of an enigmatic
    name. If you want to include the descriptor, let it live somewhere else &#40;the
    bottom or side of a letterhead, tha back of a card or t-shirt, the wall of the
    office, the title bar of a web browser, etc.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts.
