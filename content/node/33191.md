  and yellow.\r\nthe layout is really grid based, and FF DIN has been obvious since
  day 1.\r\n\r\nI really like the german look of DIN, but I feel it is a bit overused
  these days. \r\nI would love to use a font slightly different. The same, but different
  (like coke/ pepsi).\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I thought about modifying DIN, but I'm
  not skilled enough to touch such a beauty.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if one of you
  type experts could suggest a substitute for DIN.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for anyhelp
  you could give.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks anyway for the amazing quality of the content
  of this website.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJ."
