  body: The lowercase is very close to <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/bertham-pro/|Bertham]]</strong>
    (by Frederic W. Goudy, Steve Matteson) but the uppercase is quite different...

    example in Goudy Old Style http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/goudy-old-style/
    but I did not spot an exact match to any digital font.  \r\nF.W. Goudy is known
    to have designed over 120 fonts, including ones that were for private purchasers.
    See the list at http://www.goudyfonts.com/shop-numerical/\r\nOther persons have
    designed fonts in Goudy's style.\r\nIt is possible that this is a private font
    for Smythson that uses an expanded width of the letters.\r\nBTW you do not provide
    a reference for your statement \"I agree with the author of the below thread who

    after I made my post. I also saw that you added a link to the previous thread.
    I checked the link in that thread to Monotype Classic Roman.\r\nIf you use Monotype
    Classic Roman for the upper case and Bertham for the lowercase, and expand the
    width you will be fairly close to the font being used by Smythson .\r\nDon"

    lower case Beltham looks pretty darn close to Smythson's. I should point out that
    I put the Classic Roman into bold and left Beltham not bold to get the right combination.

    although the spacing looks a bit too tight in your re-make. You can adjust the

    a better version.\r\n\r\nThe lower case k is a little off and some of the capitals
    and lower case don't quite sit well together (see \"Together\" and \"His\") but
    again some playing with character spacing can probably fix that.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    term, we know the typeface is a Smythson proprietary one - but we've found a good
    match.
