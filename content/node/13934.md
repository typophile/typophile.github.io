    target=\"_blank\">Elsner & Flake version of Papyrus</a>, but there are some discrepancies.
    Whatever it is, it's been contorted in a way no font should ever be contorted.\r\n\r\nI
    remember someone requesting a similar font before. It wasn't Ereshkigal, and it
    wasn't Papyrus, but I can't remember exactly what it was.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "There is a version of Papyrus called Parchment that was done by Rick Mueller
    and is available for download at TypOasis (from the Designer pages). Maybe that's
    the one Lex was remembering, however, comparing the outlines of Papyrus and Parchment,
    I believe Papyrus was clearly the source. The nicks and dings in the letters are
    in the same places in Papyrus, but Parchment is relatively smooth. The only obvious
    modification I see is that the E's middle arm has been shortened in the posted
    sample. This looks to me like the outline points of the middle arm were just shifted
    left. It's been distorted somewhat, but I am convinced this was made with Papyrus.\r\n\r\n-
