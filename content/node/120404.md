      is displaying is making the O appear to be lighter than the N. I just checked
      and they are the same weight."

  body: "Probably it works better in the first example. It could not be easy to place
    as a logo, though.\r\nBy the way, the fact that |O| and |N| are the same weight,
    doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re optically adjusted for every situation:
    they surely work fine in an even spaced, uniformly coloured word say, in an heading.
    But here there\u2019s need of hierarchy and direction."

    Agree with riccardo that the weight doesn't look right around the o and n.\r\n\r\nI
    had a client who had a very wide logo and it occasionally caused problems when
    only a narrow space was available. The letters become tiny...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo80_5518.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
    may think you'll never need to make your logo that narrow, but you might occasionally."

    might pick the wrong one might, but if this is for a design firm it could work.

  body: Thanks for the comments! I prefer the first version too with greater weight
    on the first part of the logo. I do worry about it being too wide of a mark, and
    would definitely be a good idea to create a small size version. THanks for the
    additional link too!

    also turn out weird when printed. Have you considered a simple light-to-dark progression
    of a single hue, or even just keeping it all monochromatic?"

  body: "@arosa9480 - have you experimented with a condensed font, such as Steelfish
    or Bebas?  They only have 7 and 4 weights respectively, so you'd need to customise,
    but it may reduce the width enough to make the concept workable.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    my first impression when I first saw your post was how interesting it would be
    if it was oriented vertically, with the letters bunching at the bottom.  Is your
    brief relaxed enough for you to experiment with that idea?"

      fonts because they echoed planets, stars, etc. in space. Here is one version

      though, what do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: '@arosa - it''s still wide, but I think that works a lot better.  I also happen
    to prefer the reverse direction, with the letters getting heavier to the right.  The
    image I get from the original is one of ''repulsion'' not ''attraction''.  '

    I agree with you. Unfortunately, I just don't think that I can get this one to
    work ... even though I really like the concept, but, just doesn't work with the
    name.\r\n\r\nIf you all are interested. Here is another idea I have come up with.
    This is a simple mark that uses a G and a C for \"Gravitational Creative\" that
    come together to echo a planet, star, black hole, etc. Also the line on the G,
    going into the center of the circle, symbolizes gravity moving to the center of
    mass. It could also symbolize rings around a planet. I plan to use different gradients
    with the logo, identity items as well. \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any additional thoughts
    on this new idea. Thank you all for your thoughtful comments so far. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: Hmm I rather liked the very first one - the sense of release into space as
    you read is a bonus. The opposite happens when you read the reversed one and the
    letters get bloated and clump together. To save space you might consider a curved
    format for the letters?

  body: "The horse has left the barn but a few comments:\r\n\r\nIMHO this does not
    make a good logo. It makes a great, and interesting, and even elegant type treatment
    for say an article title where it can be offset/balanced with page layout, but
    it is too imbalanced, distended, and horizontal for a logo.\r\n\r\nAll the weight
    is at one end or the other, and it virtually dissipates into nothingness at the
    end. The name implies things that are good in a design firm... design with gravity,
    with weight and substance and impact. But the treatment actually implies the opposite;
    mass dissolving into nothingness.\r\n\r\nIt's too horizontal. It will work on
    a web site header or letterhead, and maybe on a pen, but the constraints it poses
    on usage in other applications is rather severe, both in terms of form and readability.\r\n\r\nIt
    points up the fact an interesting and compelling design type design doesn't automatically
    translate into logo effectiveness and utility.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is the
    length of the name, which is right at the limit of manageability. A company name
    with five syllables is working at a disadvantage. \r\n\r\nI would have tried having
    the name go bold-light-bold or light-bold-light and simply adjust the spacing
    for visual balance and readability. It would have been more compact and symmetrical.
    Not sure if it would still work as a logo, though. This situation sort of begs
    for a mark/symbol that can be used with/without the logotype."
