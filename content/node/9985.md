  body: '&#62;But proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  <BR> <BR>I was talking
    about the C-fonts and Bill&#39;s critique of them - not about ClearType itself.
    I was making the point that until the fonts are shipped and people start using
    them, it&#39;s difficult to properly judge them from a bunch of scans on the Poynter
    site.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I agree with all the quotes you attribute to
    Microsoft employees, but a few of them look familiar. 3. is definitely wrong though
    - fractional point sizes are definitely possible in Avalon WinFX.'

  body: 'Si, I agree with you absolutely that it is difficult to judge type from scans
    on a website. But the problems with the CT Collection are so egregious that they
    are perfectly obvious as presented there. I may as well say that I had made up
    my mind not to post until I had seen the types and the book, until I discussed
    the matter with Type God A, very familiar with the types, who told me there was
    no significant difference between the types as demonstrated on Poynter and the
    types as available in any other form. <BR> <BR>In any case, nobody has come back
    to me and said &#39; &#39;Bill, your criticism is wrong. On screen, or in print,
    the problem you are referring to is not evident. The fitting error you mentioned
    is not in the font - it is a rasterization mistake on the site, or a printing
    error in the book.&#39; There&#39;s a reason for that. The problems are evident
    at a glance. <BR> <BR>Look, the problems are so great that it is obvious that
    most of these designers have no grounding in text type vernacular and can only
    be trusted to make clones of text or fancy display faces. <BR> <BR>What is equally
    clear is the degree to which features in these types impede readability. Let me
    give just two examples.  <BR> <BR>Take Corbel. Look at the upsweeping curves at
    the top of a and r. Beautiful! Just lovely. I love them. I really do. They are
    aesthetic triumphs.  <BR> <BR>But they are functional disasters. They impede readability
    because they draw attention to themselves as beautiful artefacts -- and because
    their excessive slope and area gets you thinking vertically rather than horizontally.  <BR>
    <BR>We see here the traditional mistake of the amateur type designer - love of
    aesthetic form versus love of typographical function. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s look
    at Constantia. Did someone say contrast impedes readability? Then what are all
    those contrasty glitches doing on r, f, c, etcetera? Even in print, they are unidiomatic.
    But in a type intended for reading, they are traffic-blockers.  <BR> <BR>In so
    many of these types, you see lovely aesthetic ideas that create traffic jams in
    the race to read through a word. The very last thing you want to see is an aesthetically
    remarkable feature. All text type is about function, function, function. <BR>
    <BR>On the other hand, there&#39;s the low contrast Dutch type by Bosma -- very
    safe, very generic, very Lexicon. There is one superbly judged feature I think
    I like, the ball of the a. But the overall widths of the letters are all wrong.
    Most are too narrow, giving a choppy, vertical effect which is the very opposite
    of what you want in text, which must have horizontal flow. The excessively narrow
    o is one of the clumsiest o&#39;s I have ever seen, and I am a dreadful drawer
    of o&#39;s. There isn&#39;t enough overhang in the f, a fault which is especially
    distressing in the bold, and the bold teeters on illegibility because the x-height
    has been raised too much in that weight. And then, in the  midst of all this compression
    &#40;which is the very last thing you want in a readability font&#41;, you have
    the r sticking out like a sore thumb, because, though lovely entirely on its own,
    it&#39;s too wide to fit in with the rest of the characters. <BR> <BR>But do I
    have to go on? Everywhere in these types, you see a thousand areas for improvement.
    Everywhere you see that where there is a choice between beautiful aesthetics and
    pure functionality, aesthetics always wins.  <BR> <BR>You know, one of Bud Kettler&#39;s
    tests in proofing a font was to study it upside down. <BR> <BR>Did anyone do that
    here? <BR> <BR>Well, there&#39;s a reason why Courier is a great typeface. <BR>
    <BR>What I see here is a bunch of types that need some expert, thoroughgoing art
    direction. I see some nice work with promising ideas that needs a lot of firm
    revision. These look to me like first drafts from the designers. I don&#39;t think
    there has been any substantial critique. I would be astonished to hear that these
    types had been extensively reviewed by a knowledgeable panel of any kind and sent
    back for cycle after cycle of revision until they just looked . . . . transparent.
    <BR> <BR>Stylistically, I regard these types as fashion statements, not as functional
    text type. <BR> <BR>Please, Si, just hire someone competent. Someone who just
    knows how to make a functional type rather than a pretty artefact. Well, you know
    my recommended list -- and you know where they live. <BR> <BR>David says time
    is running out. I am not sophisticated enough to respond to what he is talking
    about. But that particular statement resonates for me in the different, simpler
    sense in which _I_ see that time is running out: <BR> <BR>Time is running out
    for the designers who know what they are doing. There are a few designers over
    50 who really know what they are doing. And there is virtually nobody under 50
    with anywhere near that degree of skill. Microsoft has done some wonderful services
    to type by getting some excellent work out of the old pros. Why stop now? Especially
    at the point where you really need some _excellent_ type? But forgive me for repeating
    myself. I am not advancing the discussion here. Let some better brains steer the
    till.'

    than Bill, is interested in what I said, contact me. <BR> <BR> <BR>Bill, phrases
    like &#39;the race to read through a word&#39; suggest that you don&#39;t know
    the basics of the visual and cognitive mechanics of reading. Your idea of &#39;traffic
    jams&#39; impeding reading is quaint but lacks any scientific support. If you
    want to critique type designs based on aesthetics, or even on whether or not you
    like the designer, then that is a matter of taste. But if you are going to start
    criticising typefaces on grounds of readability, then you need to get at least
    a basic understanding of how we read. You could start <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx">here</a>.

  body: 'John, could you please make a more advanced suggestion? There is nothing
    in Larson&#39;s paper I am unfamiliar with, and I have never subscribed to the
    bouma theories bandied about by some people on these lists. For one thing, I find
    it impossible to think of the word &#39;bouma&#39; without laughing - it is so
    undignified. For another, well, let&#39;s just say that word shape recognition
    runs counter to the bulk of reading science, and finally, I just have never accepted
    it because it didn&#39;t make sense to me. So I expect we are in perfect agreement
    on that point. If there is something radically new in legibility research, I would
    certainly like to know about it. <BR> <BR>However, here, I would prefer, rather
    than discussing general readability issues, to get down to the nitty gritty of
    some of the issues I have raised, such as the u in Calibri. Can&#39;t someone
    just tell me that what I am seeing is a rasterizing error, or just a weird typesetting
    mistake? Nobody would be happier than I to find this out. I mean, first I got
    slagged by Leonidas and Issac for knowing too much because I had the fonts. And
    then when I said I didn&#39;t have the fonts, I got slagged by Simon for not being
    in a position to judge. Can&#39;t win! And tell me, are you still an avid supporter
    of InDesign&#39;s optical kerning? I remember you taking the very strong stand
    that InDesign&#39;s optical kerning provided superior spacing in most fonts, so
    much so, that you said the application should be allowed to determine spacing,
    rather than the font&#39;s original metrics. Is this still your position?  <BR>
    <BR>And to get to some of the issues David has raised, using his point numbers:
    <BR> <BR>0. Could you tell us more about the mall test? What were the C-types
    compared to? As you describe it, it sounds pretty lame. <BR> <BR>1. What is the
    justification for the OS not to know screen dpi? And in that case, is there a
    manual setting? &#40;And is there any research on how many hundred people would
    use it?&#41; How does this contrast with whatever Apple and other systems may
    be doing? <BR> <BR>2. What degree of contrast is bad for readability? Could you
    be more specific? Is there any actual proportion of thin to thick that has been
    established? Like, is 1:8 or something like that too much? Where is Times on this
    scale? Georgia? Bodoni? Low contrast SON Dutch generics? Has any of this affected
    the CT collection? <BR> <BR>3. Could you be more specific about fractional point
    sizes? Is it that you can&#39;t specify them? Or is it that if you do specify
    them, they will be faked, or ignored, as has so often happened in the past?   <BR>
    <BR>4. I have heard for many years that CT will ultimately be good enough for
    fonts not to have to be hinted anymore. If that is the case, where is Quartz?
    I have been concentrating so much on the current glories of ClearType that I have
    failed to notice that my Mac displays don&#39;t look that bad, after all. I was
    kind of surprised. Will there come a point, reasonably soon, when ordinary PS
    fonts look just great on screen? <BR> <BR>5. These terms are incredibly general,
    but in these general terms, and granting that there is much room for misunderstanding,
    I would say that rhythm is more important than color for the simple reason that
    I have always found that types of strikingly uneven colour could be not only gloriously
    readable but quite attractive -- so much so, that I have sometimes wondered how
    important consistent colour really is? Could we usefully define these terms more
    stringently? I realize that type design and readability are too complex to reduce
    to simple science, but I think we need better definitions here. For example, how
    do you qualify a type that has strikingly uneven colour but phenomenal fitting
    and that just works really well? Maybe I know what you&#39;re talking about -
    - - - but maybe I don&#39;t?  <BR> <BR>8. That&#39;s hilarious. You know where
    I think the money should be spent. <BR> <BR>9. If that&#39;s what they&#39;re
    saying, I don&#39;t believe it. They&#39;re just kidding themselves. But I do
    have some experience with designing scientific experiments, and I understand how
    easy it is to be led astray. And I&#39;m not sure that I understand what you mean
    when you say &#39;&#34;read&#34; literally&#39; - sorry to be so dense!'

  body: 'Bill, if you are familiar with everything in Kevin&#39;s paper, I&#39;m left
    wondering why you used phrases like &#39;the race to read through a word&#39;.
    As Kevin&#39;s paper points out, we&#39;ve known with certainty for a hundred
    years now that there is no reading &#39;through&#39; a word, there is no passage
    from one end of a word to another. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be frank about why I have
    not directly responded to your criticism of the Calibri u: I didn&#39;t read it.
    I have not read it, and I&#39;m not about to go dig it out. As I&#39;ve explained,
    I give up on discussions in which you are involved, especially when you are in
    full histrionic attack mode, because you just make me very angry. Maybe if you
    actually want people to respond to you, you might consider the way in which you
    put yourself across. Every once in a while you manage to say something reasonable,
    but generally it gets ignored, and not just by me. <BR> <BR>Regarding InDesign&#39;s
    optical kerning, when it first came out I experimented with it quite a lot and
    was impressed. I think the ideas behind it -- Hermann Zapf&#39;s ideas -- could
    indeed enable an application to produce better spacing than that in many fonts.
    But remember that this was pre-OT fonts with class kerning, when many font developers
    didn&#39;t bother to kern accented characters at all, and many fonts had only
    minimal kerning and generally less than they needed. In this environment, the
    idea of an application being able to handle spacing was an attractive one. I think
    it is less important now and, I found that once one got away from fairly typical
    Latin text faces the InDesign optical kerning was less impressive. It has problems
    with many non-Latin scripts, for instance. That said, there are still a lot of
    poorly spaced fonts out there, and sometimes InDesign&#39;s optical kerning improves
    things. In recent years, I&#39;ve only used it for specific combinations in display
    settings, but then I have access to more and better spaced fonts than I used to.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been thinking today about your responses to my specimen
    graphics, particularly your comments about Verdana, and I think you -- and perhaps
    other people -- are confused about the nature of the CT fonts. Because these fonts
    are labelled &#39;screen fonts&#39;, I think there is an assumption that they
    have been designed to meet the same goals as Verdana and Georgia were. This is
    not the case. Verdana and Georgia were designed to very specifically address legibility
    issues in b/w, low resolution display: an acknowldgement that all the super-hinting
    applied to Times New Roman and Arial were not enough to compensate for the underlying
    unsuitability of those designs to screen readability. Georgia and Verdana are
    likely the most legible fonts for screen reading in existence, and they will probably
    remain so. I do think Georgia suffers under ClearType, because you lose the even
    colour ensured in the b/w rendering; Verdana performs better with ClearType. It
    was never the intention of the new CT fonts to try to out-do Verdana or Georgia
    for readability. Not only would it be difficult, it would be pointless: as if
    every print typeface were designed solely with the aim of being the most readable
    typeface in existence. It is worth noting that in designing additional screen
    fonts for Microsoft -- Nina and Meiryo Latin --, Matthew has returned to the Verdana
    design and reworked it: it has achieved a pinnacle, and there is nowhere much
    else to go in terms of sheer readability. <BR> <BR>The new CT fonts were commissioned
    to meet a very different set of design briefs. The fonts needed to be readable,
    on screen <i>and in print,</i> but sheer readability was not a stated goal. The
    whole point of ClearType is that it removes much of the restrictions of b/w rendering
    that made the approach taken with Georgia and Verdana necessary. The new fonts
    were each commissioned for a particular use, either within Microsoft or among
    users. Cambria, for example, is intended to provide a more modern choice for business
    documents and other situations in which users have been churning out page after
    page of Times New Roman for so long. Constantia was specifically commissioned
    as a typeface for journals and other publications, and needed to be able to work
    for both online and print editions. <BR> <BR>In addition to specific uses, the
    fonts were designed to show off certain aspects of ClearType rendering: to show
    how well ClearType renders a variety of different approaches to letterform design
    and detailing. Candara, for instance, was commissioned specifically to show how
    well ClearType can render those subtly flared stems; at the same time, it too
    was designed for a particular use: informal correspondence &#40;I use it in my
    e-mail program&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been using most of these fonts for well
    over a year now, and I really do think they are very good and that you are simply
    wrong. I don&#39;t much care for the style of Cambria, and it&#39;s Cyrillic and
    Greek are not as good as in the other families. I don&#39;t use Calibri except
    in the occasional subhead. But I use all the other fonts every day: Candara for
    e-mail, Constantia as my default browser font, Corbel as my system UI font, and
    I&#39;m typing this in Consolas. They work very well: they&#39;re all nicely readable
    on my screen, and much as I admire Verdana I like having a choice on screen as
    much as I like having a choice on paper. <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to post the
    message I sent to David via e-mail &#40;and to a couple of other people who requested
    it&#41;, on the basis that your last message in this thread was quite civil and
    also because my responses to some of David&#39;s points are quite similar to your
    own. Like Si, I don&#39;t recognise some of the statements as anything like what
    I&#39;ve heard from people at Microsoft, so I presume that what we&#39;re getting
    is David&#39;s interpretation. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; O. If someone thinks the C-types
    are not the best, they are <BR>&#62; in the 4% minority of people who chose unanti-aliased
    Italic <BR>&#62; over aliased italic in the now famous &#34;mall test.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>What do you mean by &#39;the C-types&#39;? Do you mean ClearType font rendering
    in general, or the <BR>CT Font Collection &#40;Calibri, Cambria, etc.&#41;? <BR>
    <BR>If you mean CT rendering in general, then there is a known percentage of people
    who prefer <BR>b/w rendering. Adam Twardoch is one of them; I&#39;m not. Some
    people are more colour <BR>sensitive than others. I don&#39;t think this is an
    issue of typography, per se, at all, which <BR>is why the statement doesn&#39;t
    make any sense if you&#39;re referring to the CT Font Collection. <BR>It is an
    issue of rendering preference, and it doesn&#39;t matter how good a particular
    <BR>typeface is: people who don&#39;t like ClearType rendering are not going to
    like any typeface <BR>rendered that way. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; 1. Longhorn will
    not query the driver to find out what the dpi <BR>&#62; of the screen is. <BR>
    <BR>Personally, I think ClearType is pretty bad at less than 120ppi, so I could
    see some <BR>benefit to querying the screen pitch and having the option to turn
    CT off on screens with <BR>lower pitch. But see No.4 <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; 2. Contrast
    in type designs are bad for the purpose of screen fonts. <BR> <BR>I take it this
    means stem contrast. What kind of contrast? Obviously not all contrast, <BR>since
    plenty of good screen fonts -- b/w, AA and CT -- have some contrast. Very high
    <BR>contrast? That can be plenty problematic on paper too. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;
    3. fractional point sizes are not possible on the screen. <BR> <BR>As Si Daniels
    notes, fractional point sizes are possible in Avalon WinFX, but you&#39;re still
    <BR>stuck with discreet pixels in the y-direction so rendering fractional sizes
    will produce <BR>an interesting variation in height:width relationships. 11.5pt
    type might not be any <BR>taller than 11pt type, depending on the resolution,
    but it would be wider: insta-extended <BR>type! <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; 4. the CT
    rasterizer has gotten &#34;so good&#34; that as resolution <BR>&#62; improves
    hinting will no longer be required. <BR> <BR>Hmm. I think y-direction hints are
    going to be required for a long time to come, even well <BR>past 200ppi screens.
    The question is what kind of x-direction hinting will be necessary in <BR>sub-pixel
    rendering environments, and what kind of compatibility do you need with other
    <BR>rendering environments, low-resolution printers, etc. Frankly, if a font is
    designed <BR>purely to be used in a CT rendering environment at 120&#43; ppi,
    then I don&#39;t think much, if <BR>any, x-direction hinting is necessary &#42;for
    most designs&#42;. Hinting -- as you well know -- <BR>is about all design: it
    is design specific, and there are always going to be some kinds of <BR>design
    that require hinting more than others. <BR> <BR>ClearType is in an awkward place,
    because it has to do something with those b/w <BR>superhinted fonts &#40;Times
    New Roman, et al&#41;, which look truly awful if you apply the <BR>x-direction
    deltas within ClearType, so MS made the decision to disable x-direction deltas
    <BR>completely in CT. Unless MS were going to replace every single core, web and
    other font <BR>they ship with new versions optimised for ClearType, I don&#39;t
    think they had much of an <BR>option in this regard: they had to ditch x-direction
    deltas. This means, of course, that <BR>if one did have a typeface for which some
    kind of subtle deltas aided CT rendering, you <BR>would be out of luck. <BR> <BR>If
    one had the luxury of starting from scratch -- of designing a new rendering system
    that <BR>didn&#39;t need to handle legacy fonts, for which one would only design
    new fonts that would <BR>be optimised for that environment --, one could avoid
    many compromises. We are, as you <BR>say, in a technological struggle, but then
    that is the history of type technology. <BR>Gutenberg was in a technological struggle.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; 5. In general, color in type is more important than its rhythm.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t even know what that means. Depending how you think of colour
    and rhythm in text, <BR>the two are either so separate that it doesn&#39;t make
    sense to speak of them relatively, or <BR>so closely bound to one another that
    it is impossible to consider one without the other. I <BR>mean, one can consider
    colour in terms of darker or lighter overall appearance of text, in <BR>which
    case the rhythm may still be good or bad. Or one can consider colour as it relates
    <BR>to rhythm, in the way that an unusually dark individual character will distort
    or destroy <BR>the visual rhythm of text. When we talk about text looking &#39;uneven&#39;,
    we&#39;re generally <BR>describing an effect in colour, but the impact on rhythm
    is pretty obvious. When we talk <BR>about text overall looking too dark or too
    light, e.g. because of poor inking, then we&#39;re <BR>describing something independent
    of rhythm. <BR> <BR>It is difficult to respond to this statement without knowing
    in what sense colour and <BR>rhythm are being discussed. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; 6.
    The human physiology of reading evolved to completion millions <BR>&#62; of years
    ago. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s probably true in purely &#42;physiological&#42; terms,
    e.g. the structure of the human eye, <BR>the arrangement of rods and cones, the
    way the eye connects to the brain. And the <BR>cognitive processes used in reading
    are not something that came along after we invented text. <BR> <BR>The interesting
    question for which there is probably no answer is whether those cognitive <BR>processes
    have evolved further to specifically assist the reading process. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;7.
    Having the fonts done nearly two years ahead of release is a good thing. <BR>
    <BR>You know how big software companies work as well as I do: a group has a budget
    for <BR>development, so they&#39;d better bloody well do the development or they&#39;ll
    lose the money and <BR>any future funding. And there are small windows of opportunity
    for checking components <BR>into an operating system. If you are shipping an operating
    system in 2006, you&#39;d better <BR>have your fonts ready two years ahead of
    time. <BR> <BR>Is it a good thing or not, from a design perspective, that the
    CT Font Collection is <BR>&#39;ready&#39; two years ahead of development? I think
    it is probably a good thing to be where we <BR>are in terms of these fonts, in
    that if there fixes to be made we may have some <BR>opportunities. Would I have
    liked to be able to spend another year on my fonts? Yes. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;8.
    Spending a million dollars on research to prove the quality of <BR>&#62;the fonts,
    ex post producto, is a legitimate process. <BR> <BR>Did someone really say that?
    &#39;to prove the quality of the fonts&#39;? <BR> <BR>I think there is legitimate
    testing that should be done on any font that someone claims to <BR>be &#39;highly
    readable&#39;. I know that I fulfilled the design brief from the client for <BR>Constantia,
    and I like reading it, but if the client is going to describe it as &#39;highly
    readable&#39; then I&#39;d like to understand what that means relative to other
    types or to some mean of readability scores. <BR> <BR>Do I wish that more rigorous
    testing had been available as part of the design process? <BR>Yes. But would I
    have done anything different if, for example, such testing told me that <BR>really
    loose letterspacing is good for readability? I&#39;m not sure. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    convinced that when we talk about reading, we&#39;re actually talking about two
    things: <BR>the cognitive process of reading and the conscious experience of reading.
    When we sit down <BR>to read, we are not aware of saccades and regressions and
    fovea and parafovea and all the <BR>visual and cognitive mechanics of the activity:
    instead, we have an experience of text and <BR>typography, the latter less conscious
    for most people than the former. I&#39;m not at all <BR>convinced that trying
    to design type to optimise the cognitive processes of reading -- <BR>which basically
    consists of trying to increase speed while not decreasing accuracy -- will <BR>serve
    the experience of reading. So I&#39;m wary of attempts to either direct or justify
    <BR>design decisions from the laboratory. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;9. Making type that
    reads better, and I use the term &#34;read&#34; <BR>&#62;literally, will improve
    the way all small type appears to users. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t understand that
    one.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Now, Bill, do you think we can have a civil discussion?
    I picked up on one thing that you said in the past few days that I think is a
    good suggestion: in these kinds of big, multilingual font projects -- and by no
    means only the MS project --, there is a tendency for the non-Latin components
    to be more thoroughly reviewed and revised than the Latin. There is a presumption
    that type designers have appropriate experience and skill to design Latin letters
    without the kind of oversight and guidance that benefits e.g. Cyrillic and Greek.
    I think this is a problem, and I for one would be really happy to have someone
    with years more experience than me critique my Latin designs with the same attention
    that Maxim and Gerry critique my Cyrillic and Greek. Now, not all designers would
    take to that: there are some who refuse to accept advice on scripts that they
    don&#39;t know well, let alone on their native script. On the CT font project,
    I had the job of overseeing the design of Latin diacritic forms, ensuring that
    they corresponded to the expected norms of readers of the languages that employ
    them, but the idea of having someone reviewing the actual designs with a greater
    degree of attention is something that actually appeals to me a lot. I know how
    valuable such reviews are in designing non-Latin types, and I for one would welcome
    that kind of process for Latin in future. <BR> <BR>Finally, while we&#39;re on
    the subject of Cyrillic and Greek, the multilingual, multiscript aspect of the
    new CT fonts is being overlooked in criticisms of their design and the way in
    which they were commissioned. The designers were selected in part because of demonstrable
    ability and/or experience with non-Latin type design.'

  body: 'There&#39;s so much to respond to but let me just address David&#39;s last
    points.  <BR> <BR>Yes, you are absolutely right, you don&#39;t know how to judge
    until you&#39;ve done it, and I don&#39;t do screen type and I don&#39;t _want_
    to do screen type -- ever.  <BR> <BR>But - I have every right to say what I said,
    because: <BR> <BR>after spending let&#39;s say $5 mil minimum &#40;considering
    everything&#41; on these types, MS decided to allow the very first public viewing
    of these fonts, on the Poynter site, to be settings of text lines that &#40;we
    now know&#41; had been annihilated by InDesign&#39;s optical kerning engine &#40;of
    destruction&#41;. We all had every right to expect that the first widespread showing
    of these types would show them at their best.  <BR> <BR>I would never have guessed
    that InDesign was the culprit unless I had simultaneously been working on a review
    of XPress 6.5 where I had to learn, for myself, what Indy&#39;s optical kerning
    really was doing. And I learnt that several days after I posted my initial comments
    about these types.  <BR> <BR>What I first saw really was as bad as I said it was.
    And I still think the types need work. John has made clear that the quality emphasis
    in the project was on the Greeks and Cyrillics &#40;about which I could not possibly
    offer an opinion&#41;, at the expense of the Latin, and my view is that the Latins
    should have been perfected first. <BR> <BR>However, I now know that the types
    are not as bad as I feared. But, I &#40;we, all of us&#41; only know that because
    I made a fuss about what I saw. In response John kindly posted some great images
    without all that InDesign garbage, so we could all see that all these people had
    not taken total leave of their senses, as it appeared that they had done at first
    - and that first showing to a predictable chorus of oohs and ahhs from ... whomever.
    <BR> <BR>One irony is that none of this would have happened had the book been
    set in Microsoft Publisher. <BR> <BR>That said, I now have the book, as of an
    hour ago, and must admit that though there is much to like, I still stand by the
    initial remarks I made, except the one about Lucas&#39;s fitting of the u. <BR>
    <BR>You don&#39;t have to be an expert screen font designer to understand that
    there are still some fundamental problems here which should be resolved. An italic
    a that is too small or an e that is too wide is still that, no matter what the
    technology. These are simply out of &#39;idiomatic&#39; bounds and will appear
    that way no matter how they are displayed. There are still too many weird looking,
    horizontally elongated s&#39;s and I cannot believe this is a restriction of the
    technology as has been suggested to me as a possibility by someone very skilled
    in the design of screen type.  <BR> <BR>One thing I must say is that I no longer
    am so troubled by the glitch serifs in John&#39;s type - whatever it is called,
    one gets so confused. &#40;I vote the types be renamed to John&#39;s Type, Jelle&#39;s
    type, etc. - this C thing is a very bad idea.&#41; However, although the numbers
    look good to me in print, they still seem to me too small in the 2nd series of
    screen shots John provided. In print, the t of John&#39;s type seems to me to
    be angled too far rightward. I may be somewhat to blame for this, as I was the
    first to bring this subtle design corrective to John&#39;s attention about a million
    and a half years ago, and I expect I still preserve the email I got back from
    him promising that he and Ross would take my advice in all future fonts. What
    I have later come to realize is that this rule is different for every t. Some
    need it, some don&#39;t. For instance, the t in Miller doesn&#39;t. What I can&#39;t
    tell, from the book, and just a casual glance, is whether the t really does lean
    rightwards, or if my eye is playing tricks on me, or is being tricked by some
    interesting feature of the design that I have not yet identified. My only other
    comment on this type in print is that the default cap spacing seems too tight
    in relation to the lower case. But this could be kerning I don&#39;t like. One
    example is Jo&#40;hn&#41; ... another. Hmmm. Yes. I think the caps are slightly
    too tight, but that kerning is making some combinations seem tighter than they
    really are. And yes, the glitch serif on the r really does seem to pull left,
    slightly, opposite to the direction of reading. It needs a fractional inclination
    to the right. <BR> <BR>One problem with the book is that the only type you can
    really judge from it in continuous text is John&#39;s type. Although it is wonderful
    to be able to see so much of it, I do wish I could see extended passages in the
    other fonts as well.  <BR> <BR>I dunno, David, what do you think? &#40;And by
    the way I hate what you did with the f in that readability type of yours based
    on Century OS! There! I said it!&#41; &#40;uh-oh - I think something heavy just
    landed on me&#41; &#40;And ... I have to say it ... though I have the highest
    opinion of wonderful Lucas .. I still think Calibri, as I have seen it, is alternatively
    clotted, and picket-fencey.&#41; And as for Lucas&#39;s claim, in the book, that
    you could set a small type Bible in Calibri ... I have this to say. Designers
    working by themselves get hypnotized by their children. I have said a hundred
    thousand times that great type is usually only achieved by several people working
    together towards a common economic &#40;and of course aesthetic&#41; goal. Here,
    we actually have a chance that such a scenario could occur. I suggest that everyone
    involved with this project get together for a few weeks and take the gloves off.
    There is enough solid good work here for something miraculous still to be achieved.
    But only through rigorous review. Of that I am certain; on that I stand.'

    But even with Maxim and Gerry&#39;s feedback on the Cyrillic and Greek, not all

    works primarily on non-Latin types, or on types that involve a non-Latin component,

  body: John, sorry, the specific graphic on Poynter is the one that -- sheesh, there
    are so many urls in this discussion, who can keep track? -- started it all. Anyway,
    I think the one I mean is the Calibri one with the note that says it has been
    scanned from Now Read This. It&#39;s rather late and perhaps my eyes deceive me
    but, still, I must say that neither in the book nor at Poynter can I find a single
    word in Calibri that seems to have even colour. Letters seem either too close
    or too far, all in the same word. I _think_, however, that the fault is somewhat
    magnified in the Poynter scan, seen onscreen, as compared to the book but I may
    be imagining that. fi, ti, notice how they glob up. It&#39;s a pretty idea but
    yields too much density. Anyway, I&#39;m reasonably sure that the Poynter scan
    makes things look slightly worse than they are. For example, the bold x diagonals
    really look too thick on the scan, and still too thick but not so bad in the book.
    Now, suppose that this is a technical requirement that would never be noticed
    at normal screen sizes? That would invalidate some of my comments. I also see
    what seems like a lot of bad spacing elsewhere, say, in Candara, but I can&#39;t
    know whether the problem is in the fonts or the settings. My assumption must be
    that the settings are as complimentary as possible but for any of number of reasons
    that might not be the case. <BR> <BR>Re reviewers, I happen to know that you work
    with them well, and congratulate you on this difficult achievement. Those who
    can&#39;t do this don&#39;t belong in text type design. Creative independence
    has to be tempered with &#40;let me call it&#41; the idiomatic wisdom of the experienced
    community - accepting as a given that some compromises due to technological limitations
    may have to be imposed. <BR> <BR>Mais je divague, and worse, grow pompous. To
    return to the point, I _think_ I see Indy spacing/kerning artefacts in the book
    which I _think_ have been slightly magnified by the scan and the imposed screen
    resolution for the whole process, none of which at all reflects what these types
    might look like when eventually used as intended. <BR> <BR>Re John&#39;s type,
    yes, I mean some but not all of the cap to lower case combinations. Of course
    there are different approaches, and it is all a terrible headache to judge. For
    example, if I remember correctly, there are several Carter fonts where caps ending
    in stems are kerned to any likely lowercase letter, an approach I can&#39;t offhand
    recall taken elsewhere. <BR> <BR>Speaking of different approaches to spacing,
    there is a tendency to make o spaces too large, for various reasons. I think this
    has gone too far in Calibri, but obviously can&#39;t be sure. I wish someone would
    invent a program that at the very least would let you space a minimum of four
    classes of letters -- lowercase and uppercase rounds and straights -- manually,
    and then let you automatically play with varying the proportions between each
    class. Of course, someone will say that this has already been done, but I have
    been shrieking about it for years and have yet to see it done.
