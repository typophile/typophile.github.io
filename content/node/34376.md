  for fonts that have similar features like these of FF Transit for positiv and negativ

  body: "I don't know of many fonts with optimizations for light-on-dark setting.
    Clearview comes to mind immediately, but I can't think of others off-hand. \r\n\r\nGenerally
    when setting reversed out text (when you can't avoid doing it), you want to go
    slightly bolder with looser spacing than usual. Typefaces that have a broad range
    of intermediate weights available, especially medium or demi-bold, are useful
    in this regard."

    \"Halo\" weights are intended for use you mention, i.e., reversed out on a colored
    background."

  body: "It depends on what the \"setting\" is done on. \r\n\r\nWhen we were developing
    ClearviewHwy we found that White letters on Dark backgrounds (what you all call
    negative, but what is called Positive Contrast) required broader spacing, but
    a lighter weight letter. The Black letters on Light backgrounds (what you call
    positive, but what is called Negative Contrast) the design needed to be bolder
    and more tightly spaced. This has everything to do with the retro-reflective material
    that modern guide signs are made with.\r\n\r\nSo the question remains, what environment
    are the \"Negative\" and \"Positive\" settings created for? 4-color printing?
    Retro-reflective sheeting? Back-Lit illumination? Video? Each situation will require
    a different solution.\r\n\r\nJames"
