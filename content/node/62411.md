  body: "It's an interesting serif, and one I don't think I've seen before. At TypeCon
    2007 we saw some excellent work being done in Mexico on new serif families, but
    I can't find my notes about what they were. Can you rename this post (you just
    edit your initial post) so that people would know what you are seeking, like \"Recent
    Latin American serif font\"?\r\n\r\nWe may have people here who know about Latin
    American fonts, and this would get them looking at your post.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike

    become really popular. Sorry I can't identify it for you :)

    giving more descriptive titles for their posts. Just knowing something about the
    style (serif, sans, script, blackletter, Western, etc) and a key word or two about
    the sample will go a long way to alerting the right folks to have a look. \r\n\r\n-

    that there were a lot of Latin designers whose work we rarely see. It seemed worth
    a look, since often the language can be a clue to the font origin.\r\n\r\nDoes
    it look familiar to you Jan?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    fonts was about learning about typography. Anyway, I have written to Inigo to
    ask about his fonts, also hoping to get some samples for the Serif Guide. It's
    odd to me that he would have built test drives and detailed samples, if these
    were never to be made available for sale/licensing. Perhaps he only wants to limit
    the distribution? I will let you know if i get a reply.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
