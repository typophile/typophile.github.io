    to use the concept as presented on the back more.\r\n\r\ntext between the angled
    stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat stuff.\r\n\r\nhow's it taste (or how far off crackin
    the first are you)?"

    oz / 5%\" at the same angle as Z.\r\n\r\nAnd do you really need the mark at the
    front? I'm just thinking to carve out \"BEER\" in a heavier weight on it and that's
    it."

  body: "also, since this has been revived.\r\n\r\nZ brew could work very nicely(instead
    of 'beer')...keeping the jovial vibe going.\r\n(presuming it's being pronounced
    zee...though zed would work too)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which...why does Bruce Willis
    call Z 'zed' in Pulp Fiction...having been taught the Queen's English I say 'zed'.
    Don't Americans say 'zee' (or am I misinformed)?\r\n"
