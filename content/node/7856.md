    match. Good old Herman seems to prefer doubledecked g&#39;s.

    be on to something -- it may be one from the &#34;The Hague&#34; school of type
    designers...

    has a closer y, but that&#39;s all. <BR> <BR>Also checked the works of the &#39;other&#39;
    Zapf, but Nofret, Carmina and Diotima weren&#39;t right.

  body: Just as a comment, this thread reminds me once again how hard it is to identify
    the italic of a typeface. Few books deal with them as thoroughly as they do with
    the Roman faces. <BR> <BR>I wish I had all the time in the world, because that
    would make a great subject for another Font ID Guide.

    no one has mentioned <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino-linotype/italic/testdrive.html"

  body: Ryan, Palatino was pretty much covered in the earlier comments about the Zapf
    designs. There does seem to be a strong resemblance, but as we&#39;ve seen, these
    are not the only ones with some of these features.  <BR> <BR>I tried using &#39;WhatTheFont&#39;,
    just for kicks, and got Novarese Italic, and was surprised to see the similarities,
    even though it&#39;s clearly not the font we are looking for. <BR> <BR>I hope
    &#39;A&#39; gets a response from Applied Arts Magazine, but I suspect a customized
    font, or one from a foundry we don&#39;t often look at.

    The shapes and serifs are not right, even though there are similarities.  <BR>
    <BR>Diotima was one of the fonts by Gudrun Zapf von Hess that I mentioned above.

    &#40;we had it on a Compugraphic machine&#41; and was designed by Carl Dair. Raleigh
    is based somewhat on it. A new version of Cartier was designed recently with changes
    to make it more useful as a text face &#40;like slanting the italic caps, etc.&#41;.
