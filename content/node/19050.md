  ago. Over the years, he worked very closely with a number of lettering artists,
  calligraphers, <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artwork/424497083/ian-hamilton-finlay-the-flageolets-surname--drum.html\">stone
  carvers</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artwork/424525270/ian-hamilton-finlay-je-vous-salue-marat.html\">neon
  makers</a> to realise his visions. At the ATypI conference in Copenhagen in 2002,
  Michael Harvey gave a delightful presentation showing the fruits of many years of
  collaboration with the often difficult and combatative Finlay.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/arts/design/31finlay.htm\">NYT

  a few images of Finlay's work."

    Art), to see the Barbara Kruger exhibit, and was most impressed by a gallery of
    his work.\r\nIf you like concrete poetry, his work was exemplary.\r\n"

  body: 'I recently received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0711220859/sr=8-1/qid=1148083121">this
    book</a> about Finlay''s garden and its many clever and delightful monuments.
    It is a wonderful book and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone interested in lettering:
    almost every page includes photographs of the many carved inscriptions at Little
    Sparta. The only criticism I have is that the book does not identify the individual
    lettering artists who collaborated with Finlay on particular projects, although
    it is kind of fun to try to guess from the lettering style. I think I spotted
    a few Michael Harvey pieces I had not seen before.'
