  I'm going on a two-day trip to New York City with a couple of friends, and I plan
  to hit some of the new and used bookstores down there.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if
  there are any decent typography/graphic design bookstores left in NYC that would
  be worth my while to visit?  I had hoped to go to Untitled, but I see by searching
  the forums here that they closed about two years ago.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time,\r\nJohn the
  Fontaholic"

    Greene just south of Prince. Then walk 3.5 blocks to the MoMA store on Spring
    and Crosby St. Then just up Crosby St. is a famous used bookstore, I forget what
    it's called, but it's within 2 blocks. The Strand is within a 15-min walk up Broadway,
    at 12th St. The Strand is the best one. Design is one level up from the entrance.

    great exhibitions (altho you might have just missed a good one on the 50 best
    book covers of 2006.... http://www.aiga.org/). \r\n\r\nAlso, bundle up- it's freakin'
    cold here!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n"

    Works. It is great AND they have concerts there sometimes, all the money going
    to charity. I saw Gomez there.\r\n\r\nIt is FREEZING."

    shops in the city do have decent selections devoted to the area of design and
    typography.\r\n\r\nThe Strand\r\nMoMA (either Soho or uptown)\r\nZakka\r\nGiant
    Robot\r\nCooper-Hewitt\r\nNew Museum (haven't been yet)\r\nKinokuniya (everything
    is 50% off at the original location, new store just opened across Bryant Park)\r\nSt.
    Mark\u2019s Bookshop\r\nRand McNally\r\nSkyline bookstore (great for used type
    specimen books and annuals)\r\n\r\nHope you have a wonderful time in New York!
    If you can you should see if its possible to set up a meeting at the TDC (don't
    think any books for sale, but their collection is incredible)"

    a lot of places to choose from, and I'll definitely bundle up.  (Mind you, I live
    on the Rhode Island/Massachusetts border and grew up in Massachusetts, so this
    New Englander is no stranger to freezing temperatures!)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn
