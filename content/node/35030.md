  body: "Could be just any font (sans serifs, all caps) with <em>anti-aliasing</em>
    turned off. Do you want to reproduce such an image, i.e. do you want to typeset
    text with a letter height of >10 pixels, on screen? Or are you looking for some
    kind of pixel font for a specific use?\r\n\r\nThat would help answering your request."
