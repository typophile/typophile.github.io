  on the top of the screen untill I delete them. Generally I delete the messages after
  reading them but then there are some messages I don't want to delete, as they contains
  some useful information. Is there a way to save them? If not, isn't it possible
  to add a simple button like 'Move to Inbox' or something like that, where one can
  save those messages for future reference. just a thought.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n-Satya"
