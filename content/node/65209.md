    the version # of the EULA - can't wait for the update so I know how to proceed.
    I'm going to include that in my future writing. I'm just getting started so let's

    License Agreement\r\nJarno Lukkarila Type Foundry \r\nVersion 1.5\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
    Grant of License. Jarno Lukkarila Type Foundry (later referred as \"JLTF\") grants
    you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (the \"License\") to operate its
    font software (the \"Typefaces\") on a fixed number of computers at a single location,

    of this Agreement shall automatically, and without any further action by JLTF,
    terminate and extinguish this License.\r\n\r\n8. Governing Law. This license shall

  body: "Paul Cutler, this is an Eula that is totally in accordance with the standard
    on this business. I'm not going to read it through here (in case you have fiddled
    it somehow), so better check it out on our site. Unfortunately it is a piece of
    text made by lawyers, so it might sound bit chilly. I have tried to make it more
    reader friendly, hence the versions in first place.\r\n\r\nContent of our Eula
    has been updated ones, hence the versions again. This was an update to section
    3 to grant rights to embed fonts etc. See a notice at News on our site. Suppose
    these versions are not made visible on other foundries. Or perhaps others had
    it done better...\r\n\r\nBr,\r\n Jarno"

    least. I am so sorry you guys have to go that far to protect yourselves and it
    was a bit late if you know what I mean. :)\r\n\r\nTo me it so bizarre that I would
    never fiddle with it, it stands on it's own.\r\n\r\nYour fonts are lovely - I
