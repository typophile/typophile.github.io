  group ( http://www.thewoodlandgrp.com ). However, I feel like the firm's current
  typography used in the logo is working against the spirit of the organization. \r\n\r\nThe
  current logo is set in Camellia and a bright yellow/green. This modern look conflicts
  with the organic nature of the firm's collaborative process, symbolized in the logo.\r\n\r\nThe
  image of a tree connects to the tagline \"Nothing changes until action is taken
  at the root level.\" The tree's leaves serve as a symbol for a company's products/productivity,
  which only can fully be achived with internal growth, embodied in the roots. \r\n\r\nSome
  options to ponder:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The logo to the left (1) or set among the text
  (2)\r\n\u2022 Type options A, B, C, D\r\n\u2022 Am I crazy and the original is fine\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any guidance!\r\nJacob\r\n"

  body: "Jacob,\r\n\r\nI would say something like 1A.\r\n\r\nI totally agree that
    the modern logo clashes with the more traditional look of the website.  So in
    my opionon, the typeface in A would suit the site perfectly since it's more traditional
    looking than the site.\r\n\r\nFor example, a script logo could go perfectly with
    some modern techno-ish layout, while you really can't have an ultra-modern logo
    with some really traditional serif fonts.  But that's just me."

  body: "I like number 1 with these changes first remove the rule under the name.
    The tag line is over whelming in all caps and could be rewritten in english. The
    average person wouldn't get it. Maybe that isn't important if you have a narrow
    target audience. I would also give space between the name and the tag line. Try
    making the tagline Sentence Case and a serif face. \r\n\r\nMy problems with the
    current look is the type is hard to read and the tree breaks up the name and the
    unessary rule.  "

  body: "Yeah, 1 + A was what I've been leaning towards. Very helpful to get feedback!\r\n\r\nI'll
    post the next iterations very soon.\r\n\r\nDan, thanks for the feedback. The only
    thing that's causing me to shy away from setting it in Clearface is that the logo
    already resembles the <a href=\"http://www.timberland.de/images/timberland_logo.gif\">
    Timberland</a> mark, which also is set in a similar face. Timberland has a large
    local presence and I certainly wouldn't want the two to get visually confused.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and about the tagline... technically it is a part of the company's official registered
    name, so I'm afraid that it's here to stay.\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: "Hi Jacob,\r\n\r\nI think the logo's a bit much... I'm not sure about the
    choice of typeface, maybe using a more contemporary serif (Stone?) might pull
    it round a bit. I agree with the post about dropping the line. The current logo
    kind of looks like a bit like a  bar or club (with a bizarre tree theme!)\r\n\r\nI
    know the tagline might be part of the registered name of the company, but that
    doesn't necessarily mean that you can't drop it from the logo... as long as you
    state it on the letterhead itself (i.e. where the registered office etc., details
    go)... the previous logotype kept it simple. I suppose it depends on how the company
    is known. If a company is limited company (which would  technically be part of
    the  company's name), you don't necessarily have to put it on the logo, as long
    as it's stated somewhere on the letterhead.\r\n\r\nAlso, the tagline has a typo
    in it - you've got a superfluous T on 'through'.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of getting
    the tree refined?... is there any way of making a more abstract representation
    of the roots - I know that there's a important underlying reason for displaying
    the roots, but they don't seem friendly to me at the moment. Maybe a pictogram
    approach would be a friendlier approach. What about symbolising internal growth
    through the rings of a tree instead? Just a thought...\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "I would second refining the tree, it is just too much for that logo, however
    I  would look at having a tree in full leaf as it looks a bit dead at the moment,
    btw the roots should spread more horizontally. I prefer the placement of 2 although
    it should be slightly lower so the roots start beneath the baseline. Clearface
    is moving too close to Timberland maybe it will work much better with a sans (although
    the original is too light).\r\nOn another note I was looking for an image to explain
    my point clearly and came across this <a href=\"http://www.commonsensemedicine.org/\">looks
    familiar?</a>\r\nTim"

  body: Don't worry about the Clearface type because they are about as far apart from
    end users as you can get. You are talking to corporate types and Timberland is
    a retail outfit. The cultures will never cross. As for the tree wouldn't be cool
    if you were viewing the tree from the roots like a worm, looking up through the
    roots and seeing the forshortened trunk and branches and leaves(You have to have
    leaves or its a dead tree). Just some thoughts

  body: "Dan,\r\nI think you are underestimating the acuity of viewers, although there
    is a gulf between the products of both companies there are parallels that can
    be drawn through the proposed and existing logo \u2013 tree, chunky serif, horizontal
    format \u2013 maybe enough to cause someone to have the thought that one resembles
    the other, which is obviously something to be avoided. There are many logos which
    do bear a resemblance to each other and it would be near impossible to design
    something that was unique, but if you have the opportunity, I think one should
    distance one's design from an existing design.\r\nOn the other hand I might be
    overestimating the situation.\r\nTim"

  body: "J.\r\nFirst impressions are that the strap line is way too close to the logotype
    and that the initial caps are distracting, I realise that initial caps have been
    used in the website but it really isn't doing the company a favour to prolong
    that. The strap is also very small considering the uses it might be put to, I
    think for reproduction purposes you might need to go to the full measure of the
    logo. \r\nThe kerning, especially F, is too tight except in the area it needs
    tightening Wo. Seeing the tree at that scale the root system needs some attention,
    due to its jagged style it could appear that the tree is being pulled up from
    the ground. I find the serif face too organic, approaching a tree nursery or similar.\r\nTim"

  body: "Well, your certainly not crazy. The current logo leaves much to be desired.
    Why is \"LLC\" bigger than the company name? The choice and weight of the font
    speaks little of the company's services.\r\n\r\nThe tree is too complex and detailed.
    It needs simplification. Of the choices you offer, I'm inclined towards A, BUT
    I would explore more typefaces.\r\n\r\nI echo the above suggestion about not setting
    the tagline in all caps and dropping the horizontal line. Take everything away,
    and work with the letterforms. Consider a vastly simplified tree, ala olympic
    iconograms."
