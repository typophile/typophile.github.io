body: "Hello -\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a MFA student at Parsons the New School Of Design at
  NY, USA. For my Master\u2019s thesis I am pursuing a typeface design project -\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\nEnglish
  + Hindi = Hinglish\r\n\u201CHinglish\u201D is emerging as a commonly spoken language
  in India and amongst Indians living in USA and UK. It is used vocally, while chatting
  and it is often seen in popular culture such as TV shows, Movies, Books, Magazines,
  Chat rooms, Song lyrics etc.\r\n\r\nI want to design TWO display fonts that reflect
  this notion of being Hinglish. - A Latin (English) font that is influenced by Indian
  Culture and a Devnaagri (Hindi) font that is influenced by Western Culture. I hope
  to create a scenario for compare and contrast with my two fonts that can both reflect
  the notion of being cross-cultural.\r\n\r\nExamples of influences from Indian culture
  are:\r\nhenna, Rangoli, folk art, Warli, batik paintings, paisley designs, peacock
  symbolism, Indian Jewellery, miniature paintings, architecture, temples, religion,
  Bollywood etc\r\n\r\nExamples of Western Influences are:\r\nart deco, neon signs,
  grunge look, pop art, mordernism etc\r\n\r\nMOTIVATIONS:\r\n1) I am of Indian origin
  studying in the US and would like my work to reflect that duality.\r\n\r\n2) There
  are very few Display fonts available in Hindi and this has limited their use in\r\ngraphic
  design in India. Also amongst the ones available they are not influenced by such
  western motifs-\r\n\r\n3) There are very few display fonts in English of Indian
  influence - Barring a few exampls like -\r\n\r\nkalakari - by beth Shirrell\r\nSamaro
  and samaran\r\n\r\nIndia has a rich aesthetic tradition and I want to bring that
  into my display fonts.\r\n\r\n4) I hope these fonts can comment and reflect upon
  today\u2019s era of globalization and high information exchange.\r\n\r\n5) I chose
  to design Display fonts over a body copy as it allows me to be more expressive and
  pay more attention to aesthetics over legibility.\r\n\r\nINITIAL SKETCHES:\r\n1)
  Inspired by Indian Jewellery:\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/prototypes.html\r\n\r\n2)
  Inspired by Warli Folk art:\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/prototype-2.html\r\n\r\n3)
  Inspired by Indian Instruments:\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/prototype-3.html\r\n\r\nPlease
  feel free to comment on - my concepts, motivations, preliminary sketches and more
  -\r\nAny feedback, thoughts and suggestions would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nRohini\r\n"
