  joke i found quite humorous:\r\n\r\nQ: what do making love in a canoe and american
  coffee have in common?\r\nA: they're both too close to water.\r\n\r\nFor a few more
  insights, you can check out <a href=\"http://www.pilcrowtype.com/blog\">my other
  blog</a> (still very much a work in progress)."

    coffee\", substitute in \"American beer.\" And instead of \"too,\" bring in\u2026well,
