body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shadytypo_6658.png]\r\n\r\nSo I am designing
  this T-shirt and I came across this font pairing problem. I want to pair a sans-serif
  with a sans. That is because the red flipped  \"\u018E\" is  indispensable and refers
  to EMIN\u018EM. So I basically have these four combinations(please ignore the kerning
  for now). I was hoping you guys could tell me how good and bad they are, and suggest
  best pairings too. \r\nThanks"

  body: I think the contrast looks best in the lower left combo, and the square shaped
    sans-serif is something I associate with military fiction, so I think it fits
    the content.

  body: "In all of them the flipped E looks to be the wrong size/weight. Justifying
    anything with an upper case Y at the end is difficult because of the big white
    space. Maybe try a lowercase style y with a vertical right side. Something more
    like this, but, you know, done properly rather than quickly:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shady_5614.JPG]"

  body: Yes Sanderpe, Bank Gothic looks the best. I am going to go with it. Daverowland,
    thanks for the great suggestion. Never thought about that. And I agree with what
    you said about the flipped "E". I just quickly traced it from the logo and used
    as it was. I will adjust it to the proportions and weight of Bank Gothic. Thanks
    guys.
