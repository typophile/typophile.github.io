  Type:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/\r\n\r\nI'm billing it as, \"One place for web typography\"
  because I hope to remain aware of all of the issues we face as a typographic and
  graphic design community. I mean it to be a sensible place. So many of the resources
  we find online sensationalize web typography. It gets a lot of hype. I think instead,
  what we need is a place to calm all of that hype and figure out what's in front
  of us.\r\n\r\nI would especially like you to know about it because your opinions
  are so valuable. As experts in the art and craft of typography, you bring things
  to the discussion that many web designers cannot.\r\n\r\nThis blog portion of Nice
  Web Type just got rolling:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/notes/\r\n\r\n... I have only
  a few posts so far. For a good idea of my thought style, check this Typophile thread
  from 2006:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/19502#comment-121155\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  time!\r\n\r\nTim"
