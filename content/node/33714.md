body: "OK, here's a (not so) hypothetical question...\r\n\r\nSuppose you know of someone
  who used Fontlab to change the permissions on a font so they could embed it in a
  website using WEFT. What responsibilities do you have, especially if they are not
  a part of your organization? What steps would you take? Does it change if you don't
  think highly of the particular foundry's EULA?\r\n\r\n"

    hate the someone in question, or are a good friend of the designer who is not
    getting embedding fees, follow the Ann Landers rule and just MYOB."

    of someone who used", that means <strong>you know</strong> and <strong>you are
    aware of</strong> the subject. If you pact with it, then I suppose you can be
    held responsible as well. I think. '

    defense.\r\n\r\nI think your obligation is to let your friend know his activities
    are illegal and that you don't approve, but as far as ratting him out...? I dunno.
    Gets into a grey area. Am I gonna report everyone I know who messes around with
    their tax returns? Hardly (altho the thought did cross my mind after an ex cheated
    on me). And it's not like you're going to be held liable for knowing and keeping
    silent. There's no font police that I'm aware of, nobody's life is in danger,
    and reporting your friend sounds awfully iron curtain to me."

  body: Actually, it's a funny situation, because it's not a friend - it's someone
    on a website where I am a moderator. I will take action (or have someone at a
    higher level take action) in the actual discussion online (currently awaiting
    a response in non-official mode), but was trying to think through other implications
    - mostly because I *do* care about fonts, and therefore find I care about making
    sure font designers get their due.

    a rather useless and silly technology that never really got off the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I
    think your obligation is to let your friend know his activities are illegal\"\r\n\r\nAre
    they illegal? Or is it merely a breach of contract? Or is this just a semantic
    issue?\r\n\r\n\"therefore find I care about making sure font designers get their
    due.\"\r\n\r\nIMHO, embedding or not really seems to have no effect on the designer
    of the font. What's it to them if it's embedded on a web page or not?"
