  used organic and humanistic forms along with sperm to\r\nshow the need of more and

  body: "are they all vectors Courtney?!\r\n\r\nI think the look good in terms of
    the useage. I'm not mad about some of the letterforms as I feel they resemble
    Hobo which is a pet hate of mine. "

  body: "Incredibly, judging by your poster at flicker, it's not really that hard
    to read it in smaller sizes, though I definitely think they should be used huge!
    And maybe they don't even spell a word. Just plain, lone letterforms (or cropped
    areas of it). I get \"masturbation\" more than \"sex addiction\" out of it. There
    are pubic qualities to your typeface, in a good way :) Keep it up (no pun intended)!
    I agree with jayyy about the letterforms - some of them could be better and still
    have that ornamental thing going on!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nRodrigo Saiani"
