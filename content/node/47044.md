  What I see based on my searches of Typophile is that the majority of us on macs
  seem still to be using 10.4. I am wondering what if any pros/cons you think there
  are in going to 10.5 in terms of the stability of Fontlab, ADFKO, Tal's software
  etc. And also for Parallels and interaction with Win XP. Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    that way & just download stuff for it while in OSX? Or is that a false idea?

    Consider OSX upgrades more like service packs...they're fairly painless so you
    might as well go with the newer version if you can.\r\n\r\nThe big thing is .5
    is Time Machine.\r\n\r\nBootcamp vs. Parallels isnt' really a security thing.
    Both are Windows. ;o)\r\n\r\nParallels wins out for me as I can run it at the
    same time as everything else. Store your work files in OSX, and access them from
    Windows running in Parallels. That way your disk image isn't as large and you
    can wipe and restore Windows at anytime without loosing your work files."

    system is already. If you have a huge surplus of RAM and multi-core processors,
    you'll have no problem running everything at once. On a lower-end system, or if
    you're playing resource hogging games, you might be better off with the dual-boot
    setup.\r\n\r\nMy old 500 MHz G4 is pretty well topped-out running 10.4.11, and
    I don't expect to be in a position to upgrade the whole system any time soon."

    I was using in 10.4 is still working great. I haven't used Windows on it. My machine
    is a MacBook Pro 15\" 2 GHz 2 GB.\r\n\r\nI'd say, go for it! 10.5.4 has just been
    released which fixes some nasty crashes with InDesign CS3. Apple has already announced
    10.6 (Snow Leopard), so by the time you're well into the academic year, you might
    start thinking that 10.4 is somewhat outdated. And you definitely don't want to
    be doing OS updates during crunch time... ;^)"

  body: "I've been using Leopard since it was released. Initially it was a bit wonky,
    but that's been pretty much sorted out.\r\n\r\nMy favorite Leopard features (things
    I would miss if I had to go back to Tiger) are: Quick Look, Time Machine, the
    streamlined networking user interface, and Spotlight (which works much much better
    than the Tiger version).\r\n\r\nI thought I would like Spaces, but I haven't found
    it to be that useful. Cover Flow looks cool, but I tend to avoid using it. Quick
    Look is better if I want to browse the contents of files.\r\n\r\nI disable the
    3D dock and the translucent menu bar. Other than that, the window \"chrome\" looks
    nicer and is more consistent.\r\n\r\nIn general, I find Leopard to be at least
    as stable as Tiger. One of the reasons I upgraded so soon was that I was having
    a lot of stability issues with the Finder in Tiger on my main machine. Leopard
    cleared it up. Although it may be that re-installing Tiger would have worked just
    as well.\r\n\r\nOne thing: If you have a pre-Intel Mac, you lose the ability to
    run Classic apps. (Intel Macs can't run Classic apps, even in Tiger.) My experience
    with OS X is that most of the stability problems I had (especially anything to
    do with fonts) were related to Classic, so I don't think this is a bad thing."

    the 10.4 BootCamp anymore, so you'd have to acquire it against its license if
    you wanted it. Also, since it isn't supported, you don't get updates or technical
    support on it, which you would for 10.5.\r\n\r\nI use BootCamp on 10.5 with Vista.
    Dan Rhatigan from last year has 10.5 (?) with Paralells and XP.\r\n\r\nAs for
    this year's class, most of us have updated to 10.5 since its release last year.
    I don't really see why you'd want to prefer 10.4."

  body: "Hm. Important exchange.\r\n\r\nThe balance is that there's loss of OSIX support
    even on Motorola machines, patched up search, another step towards less clumsy
    networking, being held hostage by boot camp and then there is the time machine
    as only the legitimate selling point. For that the tedious new graphix are a heavy
    price to pay in terms of performance.\r\n\r\nI stick to OS 10.4.9 with WinXP on
    Parallels, until there's a functional upgrade. No need for bootcamp whatsoever.
    My present configuration is rock-solid, well integrated and fast on a 2.4Ghz,
    4Gb memory MBP.\r\n\r\nFor FontLab and Fontographer I use Windows because I happen
    to have these versions, for CS3 Mac for speed or Windows for convenient Unicode
    interchange and most international functionality, as the MacOS still hasn't caught
    up with Windows.\r\n\r\nI gave up on the MacOS searching function. If I really
    want to find what I am looking for, and not everything else that looks vaguely
    like it but what I am not looking for, then I search with the Windows file browser.\r\n\r\nThomas

  body: "Eben, my advice is to think carefully about whether you need to run any software
    that isn't compatible with 10.5. For example, some applications like Freehand
    or Quark 6.5 have not been updated and are not known to work reliably on 10.5.
    If you're application software is current-- CS 3, Quark 7.x, now would be a good
    time to upgrade. Keep in mind that we are currently on the fourth 10.5 update,
    so many serious issues have already been addressed. \r\n\r\nAs Mark pointed out,
    there are some nice features with 10.5. For example, once I started using Quicklook
    (space bar) to preview files, I've needed to keep fewer applications open. My
    problem now, is that I now try to do it on my Windows system, and puzzle for a
    second about why it isn't working. "
