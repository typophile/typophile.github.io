  body: ' Very classy, well crafted, and very readable. Your lc &#34;g&#34; is a surprising
    success. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re calling it a Bold &#40;standard practice for a bitmap
    font with 2-pixel stems&#41;, but I think this is what works for on-screen reading.
    <BR> <BR>Consider: <BR>1. Calling it a Regular, and making Light and Bold &#40;3-pixel&#41;
    weights. <BR>2. Extending the ascenders by a pixel: it will improve readability,
    and lighten the color a bit. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    think that you can try &#34;old fashioned&#34; numerics to go with this letters,
    and &#39;cause it&#39;s a serif font, make precise kerning settings for all characters.

  body: ' thanks very much for the responses.  the weight of punctuation is definitely
    off, as is the kerning - something I have yet to fully grasp technically, especially
    with serifs... <BR> <BR>Hrant, thanks, I agree with you regarding &#34;bold&#34;
    screen fonts seeming in reality more like regular width - Gregory&#39;s excellent
    kind family as an example. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post the light version shortly...
    I was working on a three-pixel width but it looked too rediculous! '
