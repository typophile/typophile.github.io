  body: "In CorelDraw, what I usually do in such instances is draw the straight line
    as a true vertical, then rotate it to as close an ideal position as possible,
    taking note of the angle of rotation. I then Undo the rotation, select the two
    ellipses, rotate them to the noted angle, rotate my line 90\xB0 to true horizontal,
    then Align Top for all three objects. The points of intersection are then true
    tangents. I perform any curve editing necessary, then rotate the group or new
    object the same number of degrees in the opposite direction."

    not an option, would the \"Common Tangents\" script work?\r\n\r\nhttp://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html\r\n"

    looking for.
