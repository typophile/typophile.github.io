  body: Hi Jonathan <BR> <BR>Your G looks like a 9 and you really have some <BR>confusing
    glyphs like Y/Q. Maybe you should try  <BR>using the whole pentagon for the A,
    like you did <BR>in U/W. And I really like your Z. <BR> <BR>I would cut the stroke
    in the upper pentagon <BR>stroke of your W too. <BR> <BR>Where are you planning
    to use this font  <BR>anyway? Just curious... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'Thanks for your comments, they came in very handy. <BR> <BR>The font is based
    on a piece of music that combines jungle &#40;drum&amp;bass&#41; and ragga mc-ing
    &#40;dancehall reggae&#41;. Ragga represented by the almost tribal form of the
    beehive double pentagon form, and jungle represented by the electronic clock way
    of forming letters in it.. <BR> <BR>I might end up using it one time for a vynil
    cover or some stickers or something. Somewhere where legibility isn&#39;t that
    much of an issue :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I worked on some alternates for the glyphs you
    mentioned: <BR> <BR>Using the whole pentagon for the A sort of ruins the overall
    look, but I think the changed R might be enough to distinguish the two. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Yeah, the whole pentagon A doesn&#39;t look nice at  <BR>all. The G is getting
    better. <BR> <BR>I think the center Y is the best one, but maybe <BR>you could
    try replacing its upper pentagon with <BR>the 4th one. That terminal somehow helps
    <BR>me identifying the glyph. <BR> <BR>I really would like to see this font in
