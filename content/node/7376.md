  tweaking of the &#34;T&#34; or whether it comes stock with this unique detail. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks all. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52245.jpg"

    Egiziano Classic</a>, maybe with a stroke added?  Or maybe <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=CLOTH+ES+MAKE+THE+MAN">Giza</a>?
