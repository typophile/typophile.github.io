  body: "I have to agree with Penn. I assume Russell posted it here for an honest
    crit, so 'here goes':\r\n\r\nI applaud the designer for reaching out and doing
    a card on black stock. It would have been stronger, however, as a simple 1/0 offset
    job, on a non-linen stock. Perhaps if it were without the house icon, without
    the second ghosted/textured (foiled?) background version of OHG, and without the
    signage\u2022wayfinding\u2022identity+yellow arrow combination. It may work as
    a showcase for AG Letterpress, and the various printing tricks they can execute.
    The design itself, however, has too many elements. The combination of extra elements,
    multiple printing methods/inks, and a textured linen stock combine to make this
    into a 'supercard'. Also, It looks like it may have been trimmed very tight on
    the left of the OHG. If those unnecessary elements were removed, and a simpler
    execution used, the designer could then take advantage of the extra breathing
    room. On a larger piece, such as a large outdoor sign, it might be possible to
    include all these elements, but on something as small as a business card, it's
    just too much.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n"

    just too confused....\r\n\r\nToo much in an 8x5 space\r\n\r\nDisciple your design
    - pick one or just a couple of the elements and thin it all out.\r\n\r\nwww.the-cave.co.uk"

    is always exciting to get something personal back from the press. "

  body: "Miss Tiffany's right. Just a bit of show-n-tell. :o) \r\n\r\n... It's sort
    of bit late for me to be asking for a crit, 'cause they've already been printed
    and paid for, but I'll go with \"super-card\". My day job calls for lots of tight
    and sparce so in my freelancing, I like to \"cut loose\" a bit where I can and
    this card works quite well for me in that regard. \r\n \r\nThere is, by the way,
    only one printing method involved. I lit the photo to high-light the impressions
    left by the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
