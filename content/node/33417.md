body: "Font Bros is proud to announce the release of two new display fonts by the
  talented Mark Simonson : <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?code=simonson&#38;goto=http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?key%3DMASS-KINE%26preadd%3Daction\">Kinescope</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?code=simonson&#38;goto=http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?key%3DMASS-SNIC%26preadd%3Daction\">Snicker</a>.
  Both fonts were inspired by hand-lettered titles in the old Fleischer Brothers&#8217;
  animated Superman cartoons from the 1940s.\r\n\r\nKinescope uses advanced OpenType
  magic to choose the most pleasing character shapes as you type and features extended
  language support. (An application with advanced OpenType support required for the
  magic stuff.) To find out more, check out the <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/images/1110/kinescope.pdf\">Kinescope
  User Guide</a> (1.6mb PDF).\r\n\r\nAdvanced OpenType support is not required by
  Snicker, but it has some tricks up its sleeve, including case-sensitive punctuation,
  automatic fractions, and extended language support. To find out more, check out
  the <a href=\"http://www.fontbros.com/images/1110/snicker.pdf\">Snicker User Guide</a>
  (1.2mb PDF).\r\n\r\nFor the first month, Kinescope and Snicker will be available
  as low as $29 each exclusively from Font Bros. Follow these links for more details:\r\n\r\n<a

  body: Thanks, Paul. These have been kicking around on my drawing board for way too
    long. I showed early versions of both to a few people at TypeCon2004 in San Francisco.

  body: Mark, I'm a fan of your faces. I'm excited for you. I'm going to show Kinescope
    to my boss, see if he's interested in getting it. It'd be perfect for a few of
    our projects.

  body: Wow. I'm impressed by how natural and 'organic' the open type contextual alternates
    work in the examples of Kinescope. I like the feeling of Snicker best though.
    It has a lovely happy-go-lucky feel, but with an underlying discipline. Congratulations!

  body: "<em>happy-go-lucky</em>\r\n\r\nYep. That's what I was after. The only characters
    I had any models for (from the Superman titles) were the caps and numbers, but
    it was fun to come up with a lowercase to go with it and not as hard as I would
    have thought. At some point I could see adding some other weights. It doesn't
    look bad in text."
