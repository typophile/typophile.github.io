If you have the full version of Acrobat, then the dialog box at <strong>File> Document Properties> Initial View</strong> has a checkbox "Open in Full Screen Mode", which (for a test doc on my machine at least) seems to do what you want...</div>

"...Acrobat Open Options give you the ability to make your PDFs open in Full Screen mode -- which means when you open them, or others open them, you can make it open in Full Screen mode and hide different parts of Acrobat. This means you can choose to hide or display such features as the toolbars and menus. Head to File > Document Properties > Open Options."

You'll have to enable it on that system, and create a file in notepad called autorun.inf with these two lines (substituting the name of your PDF file - no space characters allowed):

[autorun]
shellexecute="yourfile.pdf"

Save the autorun.inf file to the root level of your CD.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You didnt understand me guys :) I do have a full version, i do know how to set the open options. The problem is THE POPUP WINDOW that my clients will see when they open the file! It says: "This document is trying to put Acrobat in full screen mode (...) would you like to allow this document to enter full screen mode automatically?". I dont want them to see it so im looking for a way to skip it. 

Pls help. If i wont find a solution ill have to make the presentation in flash :(((( </div>

It's possible to disable that popup on your own computer, but don't think it's possible to do so automatically on someone else's computer.

Keep in mind that many users do not like documents/applications to take over their entire monitor by surprise. It's not expected behavior (except maybe for games). I've known folks who get very annoyed when a program does that unexpectedly.

Asking the user's permission before going full screen is not necessarily a bad thing.

		<div class="commentbody">The popup warning has been added to Acrobat specifically to prevent unexpected takeovers.

Perhaps you can find an older version of Acrobat Reader that doesn't have the warning, and tell your clients to download that.

(Do you really think it's such a bad form to <em>tell</em> your clients that they can choose whatever they like, but your presentation is best viewed full screen?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hm, that's what happens when I create a test PDF in Acrobat 7, and then someone views it in Reader 8! How rubbish! Can't help, in that case... 

So: what James & Theunis said (though I don't imagine anyone would take to the suggestion that they downgrade their Acrobat reader!). (a) put up with the popup, (b) flash, (c) there are probably shareware utilities on the web somewhere that'd turn a PDF into a self-running executable (haven't looked into whether those would then be runnable full-screen) - see whether things like PDF2EXE are any good (no idea).</div>
