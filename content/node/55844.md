  \"Favorite Letter\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG3831_5756.JPG]\r\n\r\nHere
  is what I came up with on the computer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/favorite_4852.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  page from my sketchbook didn't really have any form or purpose, so I thought what
  better shape to give it than the shape of the favorite letter itself."

  body: My apologies, but apparently my computer image was too large to post. As soon
    as I get home I will post a smaller version.
