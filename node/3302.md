  body: you might check out <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontifier.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fontifier.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>In lieu of that, you scan your stuff into a raster program <BR>such as
    Photoshop. <BR>Streamline the raster to get vector. <BR>Then the vector you can
    turn into a font using <BR>FontLab or Fontographer or FontStudio. <BR> <BR> <BR>

    <BR>Seeing as no-one else mentioned it, if you&#39;re new to type design and want
    to experiment before investing the $600 for FontLab, you could try TypeTool, FontLab&#39;s
    smaller brother, at a fraction of the price, with the added benefit its not nearly
    as scary to use! <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/typetool.html"

    <BR> <BR>All of his fonts are hand drawn like that.  I&#39;ve found several of
