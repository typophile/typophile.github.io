body: "<strong>Thread</strong> aims to collect the secret buttons from the user's
  FL. Called the \"<em>secret</em>\" because it is not listed in the \"help\" and
  \"Keyboard short cut\". The button may be found by chance as I did (works on windows).
  At least four buttons is very helpful to me:)\r\n\r\nThe following keys work in
  glyph mode:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>[z] = zoom out (press as needed)</li>\r\n<li>[x] = zoom
  out (press as needed)</li>\r\n<li>[tab] = Quick search the nearest glyph index based
  on the preview</li>\r\n<li>[tilde & grave] = Quick preview with fill outline (press
  and hold). Usually the buttons right below the \"Esc\" windows keyboard</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nPlease
  put your experience too (please ignore if this is considered obsolete:)\r\n\r\nBest
  Regards"

    through all your glyphs for problems while keeping the same window and magnification."

    allows you to type in the values.

  body: "Most of the drawing tools can be selected by hitting the number keys. I use
    these all the time.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you want to see all the key commands,
    it's no secret. Just go to Tools > Customize...  You can change them to suit yourself,
    and you can even have more than one key command per function."

  body: "Oh my days, period and comma do next glyph? amazing!\r\n\r\nHold down the
    pointer on a guide near the ruler to adjust it's angle. That one took me a while
    to find out."

    any easy way to turn the magic mouse scrolling on/off?\r\nI always need to turn
    it off when working on Fontlab. Really Annoying."

  body: "On Mac:\r\n\r\nMetrics WIndow, Shift Command P changes filled glyphs to outline.
    Particularly useful in the metrics window when working with a connecting script.
    Works in the Glyph Window as well.\r\n\r\nShift Command N shows and hides nodes
    both in the Glyph Window and the Metrics Window\r\n\r\nIn Metrics WIndow, Command
    ] advances the character to the next on in the Index order. Command [ reverses
    this."

    </em>\r\n\r\nYou're fully right \r\n\r\n<strong>@Pablo</strong>\r\n\r\nScrolling
    the mouse on FL Windows beneficial also for previous and after glyphs being edited.
    As the same function of period and comma on the keyboard (see comment of @Cerulean,
    and @jmontalbano). Maybe you could compare it with a Mac (Cmd + Scroll?) .\r\n\r\nI
    do not yet know how to turn off the scroling mouse on the FL MAC. But you can
    try on Customizing tools. And, perhaps better thought of the benefits to be gained
    with the mouse :-)  \r\n\r\n@all ... We are just collecting benefits and possible
    problems from the FL user's experience solely as sharing useful for all us. Thanks
    for all the existing post. \r\n\r\nBest Regards"
