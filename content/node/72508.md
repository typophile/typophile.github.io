  the font in the word Drummond Company a type face or something someone originally
  just drew or manipulated for this very old company?\r\n\r\nThey have several newer
  companies under the parent company with different names, so I feel it would have
  to be an actual typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks if you can help."

  body: "My feeling is that this is a customized typeface. I can imagine it starting
    as something like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura-display/\">Futura
    Display</a>. Most of the letters would not require major changes to match your
    sample, with the C and Y being the two biggest exceptions.\r\n\r\nAny idea how
    old this logo is?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "\r\nThis company is probably over 75 yrs old. However, as I said, some of
    the newer sub companies are 10 to 20. \r\n\r\nI will start with Futura Display
    and see what I can come up with. I basically need to come up with LLC (wouldn't
    you know I would need a C), but I can use the C in Company.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the tip.\r\n\r\nDee Coggin"

    part?
