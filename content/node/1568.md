  to have destroyed your hopes for a two minute ID! <BR> <BR>This is from an email
  that I got from Disneyland.  I thought it was House Latino Rumba or Benderville,
  but I was wrong on both.  Does anyone recognize it?  Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18227.gif"

    that would be great.  The closest I found so far is the House Latino Rumba. <BR>

    more angular, but it fits the mood and  <BR>overall style perfectly.

  body: Wow, thanks for all the wonderful suggestions everyone!  I think I will go
    with Fink Condensed.  I&#39;ve been wanting to buy that set for a while now, but
    haven&#39;t had a reason too until now.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
