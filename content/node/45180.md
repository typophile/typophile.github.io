  body: "Often I have read that when you use a Serif for headlines/titles, then it
    is a good idea to use a sans for the body copy. For some candidates I looked at
    the Aviano letterforms and looked for a few sans faces with some of the same key
    structural traits (splayed M, long J, G chin, and R legs). Based on those guidelines
    I came up with Font Bureau's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/|Agenda]],
    Typotheque's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/jigsaw/|Jigsaw]], and FontFont's
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/seria-sans/|Seria Sans]].\r\n\r\nUltimately,
    you need to try a few things and see what you think works. Our judgment can't
    replace your own.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
