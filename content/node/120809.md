    had a chance to tinker with different typefaces in a while, but I had to rely
    on Myriad, and it served me fairly well.\r\nOne I encountered briefly and gave
    me the impression of having possibly interesting qualities is Core Humanist Sans."

    Therefore I do not count Myriad under this genre, because it has a definite Didone

    ties between geometry and the Humanists \u2013 Renaissance art theory do consider
    the geometric circle an ideal shape).\r\n\r\nI was more curious why you picked

  body: "<blockquote>\u201CHumanist\u201D is no longer an adequate term for all sans
    styles that are neither geometric nor grotesque.</blockquote>\r\nI agree, and
    in fact I keep a huge collection of pictures of typefaces categorized in different
    folders and I have one called \" Sans \u2013 Contemporary\". I hate that name
    though as it's too generic, but then I suppose it really is more of a \"miscellaneous\"
    \ folder. Does anyone have a name for this new category which seems to mix many
    of the classical categories but is often more daring and progressive in the linework
    than the historical models ever were? This is particularly the case in the serif
    category; what comes after Garalde, Transitional, Didone, Scotch and Egyptian?
    Apologies if this undermines this thread. Perhaps this should be posted in a new
    thread.\r\n\r\nMy favorite humanist sans typefaces are Auto, Breve Sans, Calluna
    Sans, Comenia Sans, Epoca, Epoca Classic, Foro Sans, Gentona, Gloriola, Ideal
    Sans, Impara, Jannon Sans, John Sans, Karmina Sans, Libertad, Lucca, Metro Nova,
    Novel Sans. Proza, Publicala, Quire Sans, Ratio, Safran, Sentosa, Sonus, Supra,
    Tabac Sans and Vegan. Can you have such a long list of favorites? Let's say I
    just appreciate the design of these typeface to a high degree\u2014and I'm sure
    I've missed some.\r\n\r\nBrandon Grotesque is fantastic, though I never thought
    of it as humanistic before. Also, I love Signo, but you can't call that a humanist
    sans, can you?"

  body: "I really like this thread - it crystallised something I've thought for a
    while, that several of the geometric and humanist sans-serif fonts have more in
    common than most people think. Here are my suggestions for dividing up the humanist
    sans world:\r\n\r\n1) The monumental: those that look like they should be on a
    big sign. Gill Sans, Johnston. I definitely agree that some of these have geometric
    inclinations, perhaps because of the classical roman capitals influence and perhaps
    because perfect shapes look best at large sizes. Many Gill Sans and Futura caps
    are quite similar, actually. And Gill's O is nearly a perfect circle and its M
    roughly a square. \r\n\r\n2) The body text. Those that try to be fluid and more
    friendly so they work in body copy, and also try to avoid being eccentric like
    the next two. Myriad and Frutiger go here. Corbel almost does, but some of its
    little ticks and flourishes work against it. Calibri too.\r\n\r\n3) The calligraphic:
    those that try to look a bit hand drawn and avoid straight lines. Many of these
    look best when they're quite chunky so you can see the details. Ideal Sans (especially
    in its bold weights), Goudy Sans, Alegreya.\r\n\r\n4) The stripped serif. Those
    that strongly take after body text serif fonts. Heavy overlap with category 3.
    Very 90s-they look a bit dated now. Scala comes here. The normal problem these
    have is that copying a serif font too closely leaves them with an 'a' that looks
    weird-you end up with an aperture that's too small at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI liked
    H&FJ's [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/overview/|description of how
    they came to make Ideal Sans]], that Gill and Johnston were \"chilly and austere
    designs shaped by unbending rules, whose occasional moments of whimsy were so
    out of place as to feel volatile and disquieting\". And I know what you mean about
    FF and Scala, which saddens me since I love Majoor's writing on font design. It's
    not something I can put my finger on, but it just seems to be the result of copying
    serif fonts too literally. \r\n\r\nOn this topic, I like Mr Eaves a lot - it captures
    a lot of the whimsy of the serif but you can make it lose it through switching
    in alternates if you prefer."
