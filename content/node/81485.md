  body: "No, I think antofa nailed it. Here's a bigger version of the logo on their
    Facebook page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=320885847131&set=a.438376497131.242832.90946802131&type=1&theater\r\n\r\nIt
    looks a bit different because it's been stretched horizontally, but it's Aachen
    all right. Compare to this:\r\n\r\nhttp://myfonts.us/td-eN8bVY"

  body: Can you email that font for me? My bad, the Aachen I found had a different
    g maybe someone messed with it. My email is johnsonjulian38@yahoo.com. That would
    be great. I'm trying to build their website as a project but the logo isn't in
    vector format, and rather than use a pen tool I'd rather have the font handy.
    Thank you so much!
