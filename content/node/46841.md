  church in my town.  Although designing a logo is not part of the job, the logo that
  he gave me to work with is completely horrid.  I think it's one of those $99 for
  a church logo deals, where you select the logo and text you like and they come up
  with a \"customized design\" just for your church.  I know: I should be careful
  doing this.  Direct, positive and constructive criticism would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/calvaryway_5025.png]"

  body: "I don't go to church, so this could be a complete generalization, but isn't
    the pentacostal church more of an old-timey fire and brimstone kind of thing?
    That logo is very modern. Maybe they're looking to attract a more modern audience,
    but it seems like that would be more appropriate for one of the new mega churches.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the kerning is uneven, and if those are flames, I'm not sure what they represent."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.  I'm particularly interested in the perspective
    of people who don't go to church, since this will help me avoid churchy cliches.\r\n\r\nThis
    is not a final design, so I'll work on the kerning later, but thanks for pointing
    that out.\r\n\r\nThe flames reference Pentecost, the Christian holiday that celebrates
    the coming of the Holy Spirit like tongues of fire to the disciples of Jesus (cf.
    Acts 2).  Pentecostalism is a varied worldwide movement of Christianity, of which
    the old-time fire-and-brimstone style is only one type.  This church does not
    fit that mold.  Could a modern design fit a church that is neither fire-and-brimstone
    nor a mega-church?\r\n\r\nThe congregation is made up of a good number of families,
    but there is also a significant population of younger people, so I was thinking
    a modern direction would be more appropriate.  The pastor is not your typical
    minister.  He's a 30-something guy who is into a lot of hardcore and rock music,
    and so I think it fits his personality as well.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    \ These seem like minor issues compared to your observation that the proportions

    with my type treatment, or with the whole project?\r\n\r\n@Sharon: Yes, you hit
    the nail on the head.  It sounds like people need to hear some teaching about

  body: "I think that part of the problem is what sharon mentioned about the left
    flame and the middle flame. also, i can imagine in your color solution having
    red or orange or yellow for the flames, but right now they feel heavy next to
    your selection of type. I would try outlining the flames. This would add an interesting
    image to type relation, especially if they weren't treated with an even line weight,
    but more organic feeling. \r\n\r\nalso, i would think about putting that type
    all on one line, it doesn't look good broken up right now, at least the way you
    are doing it with all lower case letters."
