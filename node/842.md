  body: It was originally developed on film for Photolettering and was available as
    Letraset dry-transfer for ages. The only digital version of Baby Teeth that I&#39;m
    aware of is <a href="http://www.paratype.com/pstore/default.asp?search=Bebit&amp;amp;restyles=yes">Bebit</a>
    from ParaType. Interestingly enough, Bebit includes Cyrillic letterforms as well.

  body: Whoops, cross-post... <BR> <BR>To my knowledge all Paratype fonts carry Cyrillic
    letterforms,  <BR>that&#39;s the point of their operation.

    <BR>Oops. That was very much an oversight on my part... Thanks Yves! <BR> <BR>And
    that starry counter in the &#39;O&#39; is custom, isn&#39;t it? The original Baby
    Teeth didn&#39;t have anything like that as far as I can recall.

  body: This is so soft and friendly and approachable. I meant compared to any digital
    versions of the typeface that I&#39;ve seen. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like someone to
    prove me wrong.

  body: <i>I&#39;d like someone to prove me wrong.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, I won&#39;t
    prove you wrong because after looking at it again, I find that I agree. It definitely
    has a certain hand-drafted, television studio art department charm about it.

    either, but you know what I mean. Milton Glaser&#39;s hand is not apparent. '

  body: I do know what you mean Tiffany. <BR> <BR>I should have said that Orange Clock
    might be &#42;close enough&#42; - which can only be determined by the seeker.

    message. Maybe its lurking in one of those free <BR>font archives.
