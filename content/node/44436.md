  company often sends out pdf documents that are probably mostly viewed on screen
  yet are also printed (especially for conferences). I like using the sans-serif/serif
  contrast in design. But what fonts to use? What serif fonts best show up in a PDF
  document on screen? What san-serif fonts are best to use?\r\n\r\n"

    Probably any of the more recent Adobe originals would work just as well. :-)\r\n\r\nOnly
    partially a joke, Adobe has been known to revise the rendering methods of ATM
    and Acrobat Reader, but I would guess they wouldn't do anything to degrade the
    performance of their show-case fonts.  "

  body: If your PDF has form fields, pay close attention to the font you specify for
    use in the fields. I've been creating some PDFs for intra-office use lately, and
    I think that the font I'm using for the information in the form fields (Adobe's
    Helvetica Neue LT STD) may be preventing the document from printing on some Postscript
    laser printers (HP 5100, I'm looking at you), becuse they don't have this font
    installed. As I haven't finished troubleshooting this, I can't be mose specific,
    but I'm like 98% sure that this is the issue. This doesn't seem to be an issue
    on color laser printers with built-in RIPs, though. . . YMMV. Regardless, this
    may not be an issue for you, asI've had no problems at all with text that is not
    part of form-field elements in the PDFs.

    embedding but not editable-embedding. This means that the fonts can be embedded
    in the PDF but you won't be allowed to edit the fields that use such fonts afterwards
    (e.g. with Acrobat). Try using a font that allows editable-embedding, like Myriad
    Pro or Minion Pro, in the form fields, or a font that you're sure everyone will
    have in their computers, like Arial. You can still use Helvetica Neue LT Std for
    static text."

    office.

  body: "Although Adobe has continued to improve the rendering in Acrobat/Reader,
    it wouldn't even occur to the people doing the rendering engine to try to improve
    the rendering only with Adobe's fonts, or disadvantage third party fonts. They're
    more concerned with trying to make all fonts work as well as possible - even badly
    made ones, although there may be limits as to what they can achieve in some cases
    when the font is itself made improperly.\r\n"
