  body: "If they used ITC Kabel, the digital version is slightly different from what
    is on the album cover (which is probably phototype... this album is from the 1970s)...
    Aside from the fact that they took the dots off the letter i, the g is slightly
    different, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/james_5998.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gang_4384.png]\r\n\r\n[EDIT]
    Actually it looks more like Kabel, rather than ITC Kabel (there is a difference!)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.paratype.com/fstore/default.asp?fcode=236&search=Kabel\r\n"

  body: It's the pre-ITC version--Kabel Heavy. Bitstream has (had?) a version called
    Geometric 231 Heavy, but for some reason you can't get it at MyFonts anymore.

  body: That's weird. When I visited the site on the 20th, the "Tilde" version was
    the only one there, and there were no purchase options. The Bitstream one was
    missing. Maybe some kind of site maintenance glitch.
