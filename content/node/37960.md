  correct?\r\n\r\nMy wife and I just had wood floors installed in our house. Up until
  recently, we had been receiving a catalog dedicated to area rugs. Well, since we
  didn't have wood floors to cover, I paid it no real attention. Now that we have
  wood floors, I can't seem to remember the name of the catalog and can't help but
  wonder if I'll ever receive one in the mail again.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if any
  of you out there know of any good source(s) for designerly area rugs?\r\n\r\nMT"
