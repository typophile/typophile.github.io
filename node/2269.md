body: ' anybody else find the review format for looking at the tees cumborsome or
  am i just lazy? it seems like if we could make comments right after the shirt we
  want to comment on would make more sense than noting some number and scrolling back
  up to see which one they&#39;re talking about. either that or at least name the
  entries so it&#39;s easy to know what they&#39;re talking about without having to
  go back. just a suggestion, guess i should have made it earlier but i&#39;m late
  to this game. '
