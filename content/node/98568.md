  and defamation</em>\r\n\r\nLast week Latinotype removed Bon Appetit from sale at
  Myfonts citing that 'After discussion with Alejandro Paul of Sudtipos it was deemed
  to be too similar to Lady Rene.' It's become apparent that Ale Paul, who has a long
  history of bullying small designers and design firms with legal action over distantly
  similar type designs due to personal insecurity, had threatened them into removing
  the typeface. \r\n\r\nOn Latinotype's facebook page, certain posters who voiced
  opposition to the removal had received threatening private messages by Ale Paul
  demanding that they clean up their post. This removal is an insult to Coto Mendez
  and is essentially an accusation of plagiarism. Take a look at this image which
  compares both fonts. Its clear to see that the differences between these two typefaces
  is greater than the differences between Arial and Helvetica. Arial has been established
  as 'legally' original because there are enough differences in comparison. By those
  standards Bon Appetit is miles apart from Lady Rene.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4cgKG.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  implore the community to support Coto Mendez and to send letters of support to Latinotype
  to place the font back up for sale. \r\n* [removed by moderator]\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Ale Paul also contacted me after I released my <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/glengary-nf/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Glengary NF</a>, which was based on a 1932 Stephenson Blake
    typeface, originally named Glenmoy, as was his <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/mousse-script/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Mousse Script</a>. Mr Paul politely requested that I pull my
    version, and I politely demurred, primarily because I had chosen to sharpen the
    corners in my version (whereas his version, more faithful to the original, had
    rounded corners), and because I took exception to the designs of the /p/ and /x/
    in the original, and that's where we left it.\r\n\r\nIn any event, in this instance
    Mr Paul presented his case directly to me, unlike Stuart Sandler, who bellyached
    to MyFonts.com that my Mellisande NF infringed on his copyright to Honey Script,
    a claim which I find questionable, given the age of the original. Nonetheless,
    MyFonts prefers to err on the side of caution in such instances and gives the
    complaining party the benefit of the doubt, whether or not the complaint has merit.\r\n\r\nMr
    Paul is unquestionably talented, and I frankly envy a great many of his scripts:
    I wish that I had the patience, the discipline and the resources that he has.
    If what you say is true, it is indeed unfortunate that Mr Paul would resort to
    such tactics."

    hundred years or more there have been many fonts that are closer in appearance

  body: "The problem is that because third-party sites that host content often make
    only a few pennies in ad revenue per user, no one user account is valuable enough
    to be worth getting involved in litigation over.\r\n\r\nThus, as long as someone
    falsely accused of copyright infringement has to hire a lawyer and appear in court
    despite the accusation being false - instead of being able to safely ignore a
    false accusation without danger of becoming liable for statutory damages, or at
    least to respond to it in a way that involves minimal cost and effort - unless
    false accusations of this nature bring severe penalties, this problem will continue.\r\n\r\nIf,
    for example, companies like YouTube would be able to use false accusers as a source
    of revenue, thanks to laws providing for punitive damages from false copyright
    violation accusations, then it would be worth their time to check out if accusations
    are valid."

    the couple of letters which are present in both samples are quite different.  :/\r\n\r\nquadibloc:
    Legal action costs money. An actual legal filing of copyright infringement costs
    the filer as well as the defender. Plus, in the USA, copyright infringement on
    a font is only possible if somebody actually rips off your outlines, which is
    pretty heinous and can't generally happen by coincidence.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: I actually
    favor more copyright protection for fonts than exists in the USA, I'm just commenting
    on the present state of affairs. Then again, I also favor significantly shorter
    period of protection for copyright than the US status quo.)"

  body: 'In terms of the typefaces in question, I agree with Tom that it would be
    best to see samples of the same text in both. But with regard to what we''ve seen
    so far, I''m inclined to think that this is not a matter of plagiarism but of
    entry into a similar market of a product in the same category. There is a long,
    long history of this in the type business: sometimes coincidental, sometimes a
    deliberate attempt to capitalise on the success of an existing product. The narrower
    the genre, i.e. the fewer designs that exist in a style, the more likely a new
    release is to cause annoyance to whoever got there first.'

  body: "Several years back, BertholdType chose to sue me because I used the words
    Boulevard and City in some of my typeface names. Had they simply made I polite
    request, I would have happily complied. Instead, a game of legal gotcha ensued,
    which generated several reams of paper, with rebuttals and amended complaints
    and amended rebuttals, and so on.\r\n\r\nHowever, a lot of legal work is research,
    and BertholdType--rather foolishly--chose to sue an English major with an IQ that
    places him in the top .001% of the population (okay: I'm too smart for my own
    good). When the second rebuttal essentially nailed Berthold's lawyers for fifteen
    counts of Fraud by Omission under the U.S. Code, the charm offensive--a.k.a.,
    Melissa Hunt--suggested that we settle the matter amicably--in other words, in
    precisely the same manner as we would have if they had made a polite request in
    the first place. Go figure."

  body: "This thread saddens me tremendously. Some of Latinotype's founders are fine
    designers whose good work was first brought to the public eye as part of Sudtipos.\r\n\r\nLaura
    Varsky is a well-known and admired graphic designer in Latin America. She entrusted
    Sudtipos with her work on Lady Ren\xE9, so please understand that I consider it
    my duty and obligation to defend her work and original ideas when necessary. I
    developed the Lady Ren\xE9 font from Ms. Varsky's drawings so I personally know
    every little detail of her work and the ideas behind it.\r\n\r\nThere recently
    was a massive advertising campaign by an Argentine company called Monoblock. It
    made quite a lot of use of Lady Ren\xE9. The name of the product advertised in
    this campaign is Bon App\xE9tit. This was a very illustration-heavy campaign which
    became quite popular with graphic designers in Argentina and Chile. A simple web
    search will lead you to it.\r\n\r\nWhen Latinotype published their font, also
    called Bon Appetit, I found several similarities with Lady Ren\xE9. I asked some
    friends and acquaintances in the industry about this, and almost everyone's advice
    was to resolve it via private dialogue. So I contacted Latinotype privately and
    asked for some changes to be made to their font so that the similarities wouldn't
    be so obvious. Coto Mendoza sent to me, via Latinotype, some notes on her process.
    The images and references she sent had nothing to do with the final published
    product, which, the Latinotype guys agreed, had many similarities with Lady Ren\xE9.\r\n\r\nI
    certainly never asked Latinotype to remove their font from distribution. All I
    asked for was the modification of some details that make it similar to Lady Ren\xE9.
    And they in fact agreed to my request. I was never forceful, impolite or threatening
    about it. Ultimately, it was their decision to actually remove the font from circulation.\r\n\r\nI
    could have just as easily deposited the whole debate into the chaotic court of
    public opinion, and turned it into an outright argument like this thread does.
    I personally elected not to go that route because I thought that as graphic designers
    and type designers who have previously collaborated to a good degree of success,
    the Latinotype guys and I would see eye to eye \u2014 at the very least on obvious
    aesthetic similarities and idea derivation. Also, this is an issue I have previously
    run into on many occasions, and always managed to resolve privately and amicably,
    so never felt the need to put private laundry on a public clothesline.\r\n\r\nThis
    is all I have to say publicly about this issue. I would really appreciate it if
    people participating in this thread would not rush to judgment based on a one-sided
    post about an issue mostly managed in private."
