  The first three attachment(pete teo, logo, the cardigans)because I really love with
  those typefaces. Do you guys know similar typefaces like that? also, good for bookd
  esign/cover magazine.\r\n\r\nThe last three attachments is just because I am curious
  and seems these days, those kind of typefaces are in the trendiness. \r\n\r\nThanks
  :) \r\n\r\n"

    free font, um, if you've already checked www.dafont.com, then I'm not sure where
    else.\r\n\r\nPETE TEO: the rounds in the P don't match the rounds in the O, which
    makes me think it's a free font.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again guys :) \r\n\r\nuhmm yeah I was scanning dafont, yesterday and
    can't find it. Damn, I really like that font. I do think it was customized by
    the designer. I was really trying to dig about this font so, I even found his
    flickr account lol \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/subdisc/264286213/in/set-72157594318702341/
    \r\nJust want to share:\r\nLove what he did with the typefaces and I bet that
    also, another custom typefaces\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/subdisc/1848221702/in/set-72157594199483839/
    \r\n\r\nI know it's quite out of content with the topic \r\nbut its that hard
    to make a custom typeface like what he did? \r\nExcept, logo design, I rarely
    customized typefaces and never created from A - Z letters "
