body: "This weekend, while hanging with a fellow designer, I stumbled across a brilliant
  idea to incorporate 2 of my favorite things. Drinking and Design. It's rather simple
  actually.\r\n\r\nPick up a Design Annual of your choice (PRINT and HOW do nicely).
  The more categories the better.\r\n\r\nNow flip to a random page/spread and spend
  a minute looking at it. Hand it off to your friend(s) and allow them the same time
  to peruse the page/spread.\r\n\r\nThe idea... to select 1 design that you think
  is the best on that page/spread. Each person will make 1 selection and you will
  go around the room asking your friend which they thought was your selection. \r\n\r\nIf
  they guess right, you drink, if they guess wrong they drink. If it's unanimous and
  everyone likes the same design, everyone drinks.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously there's a
  bit of trustworthiness involved. You can't go changing your answer if someone picks
  your design. Really, what's the fun in that anyway.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested if
  there might be more ideas to add to the fun.\r\n\r\nRemember, drink responsibly.
  Course I'm not your parents, so do what you want.\r\n\r\n"

    word \u201Cconflate\u201D. Make sure you are at home before you start."

    work and no play make a type designer very proficient, I guess."
