body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am in the process of redesigning my online portfolio. The old
  version (still online) just doesn't do it for me. I have tried to make it as mathematical
  as I can, all in keeping it ergonomically simple and aiming for intuitive navigation.
  It will be coded in HTML and will have the project menu at the bottom in flash technology.
  It is but a screen shot, but your opinions, your comments and crits are welcome.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "I don't think having no bolds or other font sizes means there is no type.
    I am going for homogenous type, giving no one element of information more importance
    than another.\r\nSpeaking of Verdana, I do wish to change it to Corbel when released.
    I found it to go better with the Helvetica of the logo but that is still to be
    tested."

  body: What about a grey for the surrounding area? When you drop a black background
    in the middle the look your going for seems to go awry - when the blacks don't
    quite match. And having the ability to show things on black in your portfolio
    is a good kind of flexibility to retain. You could also dispense with a heavy
    obvious stucture made apparent by color. Or not.  Your logo may be getting too
    small...

  body: "I like what you are doing. It is clean and simple.\r\nAs far as critiques
    go I would echo Eben. The logo could be a little bigger. A concern would be that
    the simplicity may come off as a little dry. The up side to that would be that
    it focuses attention on the pieces, but the downside may be that the site lacks
    character or personality. \r\n\r\nJust a thought,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "I am not keen on flash in portfolio sites, especially when the menu contains
    thumbnails of pieces of work; how do you see the print/webdesign sections working
    with the scrolling menu? I do like the simplicity of the design, but with simple/dry
    design the composition has to be spot on, for example the image area should have
    an equal space top and bottom (I understand the thinking behind it \u2013 the
    menu of extra pages) and should be aligned to the right, the scrolling flash menu
    takes up a rather large portion of the screen.\r\nTim"

  body: "Hi Tim,\r\n\r\nThankyou for the comments. I completely agree, I dont like
    flash that much either for navigation; which is why it has been replaced. :^)\r\nI
    have been working on this new version which I prefer. Something about the about
    page bugs me but I cant put my finger on it unfortunately. Perhaps the members
    of typophile have some insight.\r\n\r\nLink : http://www.dache.ch/realine.png\r\n\r\nKindest

  body: "You mentioned wanting to specify Corbel. I'd avoid that, as 1) Vista won't
    be immediately adopted by everyone once released and 2) most viewers will then
    see plain-ol' Verdana anyway. I'd stick to what are now regarded as the standard
    web fonts for maximum compatibility among systems old and new (and Mac or PC).\r\n\r\nI
    also commend you for jettisoning Flash. While a great tool, it makes navigation
    really difficult and doesn't allow deep linking to specific projects in your portfolio.
    (\"Hey, Steve, check out what this guy David did. Uh, just go to his site, then
    click on this, then scroll to this, then...\")\r\n\r\nI like how clean the site
    looks. But, I'd still advocate including a different size, or a different font
    for headlines/subheads. It will make text-heavy pages (like \"about\") easier
    to read."
