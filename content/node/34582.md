  and would like to have your opinions on what I'm working on.\r\n\r\nThe usual question
  asked is what is the typeface going to be used for - and originally I wanted to
  make a font to be used for body copy in magazines, something that had serifs, but
  looked modern rather than like a classical prestigious (considered 'old' by my previous
  art director) serif-font. I say originally, because to be honest I don't really
  know enough about magazine printing and how to go about trying to achieve what I'm
  trying, so I'm just kind of seeing where this is going and trying to find my feet.
  \r\n\r\nI haven't really made many characters yet, but I would like to get a few
  comments before I continue for the sake of consistency and the probably glaring
  errors that I am making.\r\n\r\nBut I'm waffling. So, please be as blunt as you
  like in any comments you give as I will not be offended, I would just like to learn.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, \r\n\r\nG"

    those. \r\n\r\nMy only thought is that they might be too subtle. Especially if
    you're using it as body copy in a magazine, they would more than fill in, and
    you wouldn't see any of those details.\r\n\r\nSo maybe exaggerate it a little
    more? Have you done test prints at various sizes?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Traps are in did very shallow and \"sharp\" in a way. They are definitely
    not subtle. And there's also some strange stroke variation going on.\r\n\r\nTo
    my taste \"v\" is a bit too narrow. \"v\" and \"w\" have to long serifs on the
    top.\r\n\r\n\"a\" looks as if it would be set a bit lower than other letters.
    It's probably also smaller than other letters.\r\n\r\nThe shape of \"c\" is ok
    but has much less stroke contrast as other letters.\r\n\r\nBut continue. With
    refinement you may get a nice body font."

    there are many fonts which use traps decoratively: Amplitude and Freight Micro

  body: "Graham,\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that this design is not attractive but
    sturdy. There are plenty of examples of excellent types that also fit that description,
    so don't be insulted. You expressed an interest in designing something modern
    rather than traditional, but I think the shapes are still pretty traditional.
    \r\n\r\nThere are some features you might enlarge or darken to strengthen the
    visual identity of the letters, but overall this should perform very well in small
    sizes for reading. Your spacing seems right for about 9 points (check m right
    sidebearing). At small sizes certain features visually shrivel, making them look
    thin or weak. The tail, the top of the bowl and the top of a could be heavier
    to strengthen it, the beak of r can be quite a bit heavier and the curves of hmnu
    could be slightly heavier. Another feature that visually fades is the serifs.
    I agree they are too long on v and w, but they could be larger on the tops of
    m and n, and especially the tails of u and a. When text is reduced or set small,
    those look too light. I don't necessarily think the serifs should all be heavier
    or longer, because the short ones on the bottoms of hmn might give an excellent
    readable feel in text, but do strengthen the serifs that are essential to the
    identity or structure of the letter. The spur on the left of t is an example of
    a structural or essential serif, and it's the appropriate size. There is some
    extra weight in the various strokes of w and v, you might taper some strokes and
    thin others. \r\n\r\nThe subtle ink traps you've added will probably help the
    face look crisp in reproduction, but the overall low contrast still give the face
    a smooth, possibly dull flavor. Larger triangular cuts in crotches of hmnuar would
    add sparkle on a visible level that will be useful and attractive in text, while
    the more subliminal tiny cuts help the shapes retain their crispness through the
    printing process. There are places that connections or joints can be surprisingly
    thin and still hold the letter together: joint of k, bottom of bowl of a, joints
    of arches of hmnu to main stem, and elsewhere. To see an extreme example of this,
    look at Lexicon (www.teff.nl). The overall stroke contrast is not high; for example
    s, o and z exhibit very little contrast. Most of the main strokes are similar
    weight. But see how thin it gets at the various joints (like k, a, g, h etc.)
    and how this still does not weaken the letter in text (Lexicon is excellent for
    extended reading). There are parts of letters that are like main identifying features,
    and other parts that are nearly vestigial, which have much less visual importance.
    \r\n\r\nYou are well on your way to having a readable and sturdy text face. Nice
    details, too; the variation might prove very interesting in a display version. "

  body: 'No attitude, Jeremy. It''s just that you refer to the ink traps of Bell Centennial
    as decorative. Sure, since a lot of graphic designers have noticed them and made
    a fetish of showing them off at large sizes, I guess you can see them as decorative,
    but my opinion is that it''s a misguided thing to draw a lot of attention to.
    It''s like the 80''s trend of "High Tech", Centre Pompidou, exposed beams and
    rivets, concrete, etc. Making a style out of industrial techniques just doesn''t
    interest me. '

    can be functional, but they can be decorative too. Amplitude is a great example
    of the latter, and Christian certainly \"knows\" what traps are for. But lumping

  body: "Thanks all. \r\n\r\nI'm gonna re-work what I've done, and also attempt some
    descenders and ascenders. \r\n\r\nIn regards to spacing, Carl and Hrant, I do
    not own any type-design software as yet, and so have constructed all this in illustrator
    so far (I know this may cause problems later on, but I don't have the funds right
    now) so all spacing is just me sticking one character next to another so not in
    any way indicative of how I will eventually space them, but I'll bare in mind
    what you've said.\r\n\r\nAs far as the ink traps are concerned, I did not particularly
    set out to make them decorative, but thought it sensible to include them as I
    was aiming for a body text. As far as their being unconventional, it just seemed
    a natural way of designing them and I haven't based them on any particular model.\r\n\r\nI'll
    get back to you soon. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nG"

    _02).\r\n\r\nHave made the thins thinner and the ink traps a little larger in
    places.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if this has improved it at all?\r\n\r\nI realise
    that this is not really achieving the modern feel that I was aiming for, but maybe
    I'll try that next time. I'm a firm believer in when creating things to let your
    instincts take over to a certain extent so I'll let this become what it will stylistically.

    I've made to make things a little clearer.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nG"
