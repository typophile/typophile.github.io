  body: "I'm sticking with Monotype Baskerville for \"if\" (none of the Baskerville
    Old Face versions I could find have an italic). Same for the Baskerville text
    (given that they use italic there as well).\r\n\r\nI can't see enough detail in
    the original to sign off on Baskerville Old Face being used for the title, but
    if the bowl of the a actually goes concave as it meets the vertical and the serifs
    on the w (and other letters) are more refined, that would be the way to go.\r\n\r\nBut
    I'd need to see a larger, higher res sample of the design first in order to be
    convinced."
