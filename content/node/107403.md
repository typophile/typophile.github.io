  with Brandon Grotesque on my site, but I am far from happy. I am thinking about
  Prenton or Soleil. Chaparral and Prenton seem to have similar characteristics (look
  at lowercase a, double story g, etc.) but I am just not sure whether their personalities
  clash a bit? Soleil's geometric forms seem to play well with Chapparal Pro (I don't
  want to use Proxima Nova), but I am not sure this combo is exactly what I am looking
  for. I want to have something professional, yet playful.\r\nBelow are examples of
  both combos.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on these two, or you have some other ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChaparralPro-Prenton_4458.jpg]"
