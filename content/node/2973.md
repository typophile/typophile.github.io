body: 'I thought I was using generic MS True Type fonts that came with MS Window for
  this design done in early 2002.  After my computer crashed, I find I don&#39;t have
  the fonts anymore, and I can&#39;t edit the graphic without having the fonts.   <BR>
  <BR>I need the top font used for &#34;Making Love&#34; and the next font used for
  &#34;in Public, Engela, john, and john daniels, jr.&#34;  &#40;The other font &#34;hilarious
  romantic comedy&#34; luckily is Garamond, so I still have it.&#41;   <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  have a font that looks somewhat similar to the &#34;in Public&#34; font.  Mistral
  isn&#39;t it, but it is close enough that I could use it if I had to.   <BR> <BR>Detective
  work:  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t found anything even close to the &#34;Making Love&#34;
  font.  This might be a clue, when I open the graphic a warning screen appears in
  Uleads PhotoImpact which says, &#34;Typeface Fairchild not found.&#34;  But I can&#39;t
  find a font called Fairchild to find out if that could be it.   <BR> <BR>Ok, now
  I&#39;ve now deleted everything from the graphic except &#34;in Public&#34; and
  when I open the file the warning screens says &#34;Typeface Zephyr not found.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>So now I guess I don&#39;t really have a font identification problem, but
  I still have no clue where to obtain these fonts.   <BR> <BR>Any help would be appreciated.

  body: Indeed, Zephyr looks like Mistral&#39;s ugly sibling. <BR> <BR>The &#34;Making
    Love&#34; font looks a lot like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/avon/d-regular/testdrive.html?s=Making%2BLove&amp;p=72">
    Avon</a>, only thinner. I don&#39;t think there is a thinner cut of Avon though..
    Another copy?

  body: Making Love looks like Parade Script from Panache Typography &#40;FontHaus&#41;
    that has been stretched taller. This is one of a series of brush lettering scripts
    that were film type that were digitized. They have found their way into a variety
    of font packs of widely varying quality. Panache has some of the better digitizations
    of these, but you might have had a version in another package that was a renamed
    version of Parade that was taller &#40;to make it look different&#41;. These things
    happen, especially when you buy bargain font packages.

  body: Here are three simulations of &#39;Making Love&#39;. The first is Parade Script
    from Panache &#40;used to be available through Agfa when I got it&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>The Second is &#39;Fairchild&#39; from an Expresiv Fonts Brush Script Collection,
    which has at least half a dozen closely related styles that were digitizations
    of film types. In some cases the width/height/weight were varied and serifs were
    added or removed, round or straight, but with very similar letterforms underneath.
    &#40;Page 92 in the Dover Solotype Catalog shows a flock of these phototypes,
    including &#39;Orlando&#39;, that I think resembles &#39;Fairchild&#39;&#41;.
    The baselines also were shifted &#40;called Bounce variations&#41;, and you can
    see some of that between Parade and Fairchild. <BR> <BR>The third simulation is
    Parade Script with &#39;squooshing&#39;. Using the special lenses with film type
    essentially gave many of the image manipulation capabilities we play with in our
    graphics programs, so you could have had any typeface squeezed or stretched to
    order. <BR> <BR>I know this diverts us from your question, but I thought the permutations
    of the lettering artists&#39; work that will live on gives an interesting perspective
    to see this aspect of our digital &#39;culture&#39;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25530.gif"

    avail. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve search the MS site to see if they ever distributed the
    font where I might have installed it with an update.  Fairchild isn&#39;t mentioned.
    <BR> <BR>Armed with your info, I&#39;ve done web searches on Expresiv Fonts.  Nothing.
    <BR> <BR>Deadline looming...Any idea? <BR> <BR>'

  body: I see that Zephyr is Brendel Informatik&#39;s poorly disguised Mistral. <BR>You
    can pay them $19.95 USD at the <a href="http://www.qbf.de/english.htm" target="_blank">
    current front</a> for Brendel &#40;see <BR>the Serials Tyepcollection&#41; or
    snag it <a href="http://www.cyberman-online.de/fonts.htm" target="_blank"> here</a>
    for the price that, IMO, <BR><i>ought</i> to be paid. <BR> <BR>Better yet, pay
    for a copy of Mistral and improve the look!

    sample is not more condensed, it&#39;s just set tighter. Very tight, in fact.

  body: Thank you, Mike Simonson.  Sorry, I&#39;m not as up on the terminology as
    I should be.  Yes, it is very tight, &#40;an aspect I want&#41;. <BR> <BR>I hate
    thinking that if I can even find Expresiv&#39;s Brush Script Fairchild, &#40;which
    is the closest so far - &#41; that I will have to move each letter individual
    to approximate the letter spacing.  I&#39;m hoping whomever is selling the Fairchild
    font will also have a &#34;tighter&#34; version.   <BR> <BR>So tight, not condensed.
    <BR> <BR>Hard lesson learned too late.  Always save your fonts with the graphics
    that use them.  Sigh.

  body: Engela, you don&#39;t need a special version of a font to get tighter spacing.
    All graphics and layout programs allow you to change the spacing of any font using
    kerning. Check the manual for your program to find out how to do it. They also
    will allow you to shift characters up and down. Unless you are trying to do your
    graphics in a non-graphics program &#40;Word, for instance&#41; you should be
    able to get whatever effect you want.

    working on this problem all night and, and I need sleep?  I&#39;ve upgraded my
    version of my graphics program.  I hate learning new programs when I&#39;m on
    a deadline, but now I can adjust kerning and baseline shift.  Thanks. <BR> <BR>If
    I can just find someone selling the &#39;Fairchild&#39; font from the Expresiv
    Fonts Brush Script Collection, I&#39;ll be ready to go! <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone.
    <BR> <BR>Expresiv doesn&#39;t exist anymore, does it?

  body: As far as I know they don&#39;t. I got the collection from Tiger Direct about
    1994.  The point of my demonstration was that if you get &#39;Parade Script&#39;,
    which is still being sold by <a href="http://www.fordesigners.com/" target="_blank">FontHaus</a>,
    then you can &#39;fudge&#39; it into almost identical form to &#34;Fairchild&#34;,
    which I believe is a manipulated version of Parade Script anyway.
