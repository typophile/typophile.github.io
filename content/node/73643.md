  body: "Not at all.\r\n\r\nASCII is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding\">encoding</a>,
    a system where each character in a limited set is assigned an index number.\r\nDue
    to unchecked growth, one is nowadays wise to ask \"<em>What kind</em> of ASCII?\"
    -- where possible answers range from 7-bit to ISO-8559, ISO Latin1, Windows Greek,
    Mac OS Roman, OEM (whatever that means -- it depends on the manufacturer), or
    any other 8-bit subset. (It just <em>might</em> be relatively safe to state 8-bit
    is closely linked to 'pure ASCII'.) Even EBDIC encoding, quite popular before
    ASCII became The Next Big Thing, exists in a few variants.\r\n\r\nDomain names
    are abstract data, and so is source code, valid in ASCII encoding but also for
    example in EBDIC or in Unicode -- it gets translated to a convenient data format
    when it's interrogated. (An upcoming change in domain names is allowing almost
    the full Unicode set.)\r\nEmail servers send their header data in ASCII because
    the mail: protocol says it must. If some mail program does not internally 'work'
    with ASCII, it will internally convert the data to whatever it uses.\r\n\r\nIt's
    important for a 'coder' to know what kind of text files his compiler accepts (although
    some compilers may accept source files in different encodings). When fed with
    a text file with an unexpected encoding, the compiler will only see nonsense.\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    software worldwide is written to be able to handle at least 7-bit ASCII -- but
    it's just because you have to have <em>some</em> basic convention. Anything above
    and beyond 7-bit ASCII (and, when taken the interpretation of character codes
    0..31 into account, anything <em>in</em> 7-bit ASCII as well) may produce unexpected
    results on different platforms, with different software.\r\n\r\nWhatever ASCII
    is, it certainly is <em>not</em> a font, super or otherwise.\r\n\r\nA modern font
    type such as TTF consists of a list of enumerated glyphs, where each glyph index
    means exactly nothing at all. Tables in the font file allow a translation from
    the font glyphs to at least one and usually several common encoding schemes, which
    is the responsibility of the font creator."

    advantage -- it's called <em>standardization</em>. Without standardization (such
    as aforementioned ASCII protocol for e-mail headers), writing software would still
    be possible on a closed system, but communicating to other systems would be far
    more difficult.\r\n\r\nA historical point: before MS-DOS (utilizing ASCII encoding
    for storing file names on disk), CP/M ruled -- not one singular version, but just
    about every computer manufacturer wrote its own. One of CP/M's biggest drawbacks
    was inter-computer communication: a disk written on one computer could only be
    read by specially written software.\r\n\r\nNowadays, with the World-Wide Web,
    computers need standards more than ever.\r\n\r\nWhat Sebastian says: nothing prevents
    you from taking a note book, draw all of the characters you need on it, and assign
    a unique number to each one. Then you write an OS (computer operating system)
    that uses your encoding to read and write data to hard disk and removable media.
    Still no problem -- an Open Source OS such as a Linux variant can be altered at
    wish. But if you are planning an e-mail client, you'll need to make a table that
    converts your encoding to ASCII, and the reverse. The same goes for storing data
    on external media: if you store a text file on an USB stick (utilizing your own
    file name scheme), any other computer will not be able to read it. Even if you
    write a tool to be able to access the files, you still would not be able to open
    and read your file with Word -- for that, you'd need yet <em>another</em> conversion
    tool."

  body: "It's certainly true that ASCII - and by that I mean the 7-bit code, not the
    8-bit ISO 8859-1 - is what many computer systems were designed to work with. Originally,
    ASCII only was a 7-bit code, and computers in some European countries simply used
    a modified version of the 7-bit code, where less-used characters like { | } ~
    were replaced by accented letters their languages needed.\r\n\r\nThis meant they
    weren't using ASCII any more, but they were still compliant with the ISO 646 (or
    ECMA 6, or International Telegraph Alphabet No. 5) code because those characters
    were in \"national use\" positions, similar to what existed for the 5-level code.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the 8-bit code was developed, the first half matched the U.S. version of ITA 5,
    or ASCII, simply because that was the one in most common use. It's unfortunate
    that all languages can't have equal status, but Unicode, and the UTF-8 encoding
    of Unicode, have made it possible to use characters from other languages in many
    applications.\r\n\r\nURLs of web sites, though, ought to be something anyone can
    type in from any computer. However, just recently, it has become possible for
    Chinese web sites to have URLs in Chinese characters, due to the adoption of new
    standards."

  body: "<cite>ASCII has letters and even ASCII art on the net uses fixed font.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    are confusing yourself, and everyone else, by using the terms ASCII and Font as
    if they are the same. There are plenty of fonts that Are Not ASCII at all. \r\n\"ASCII
    has letters\" -- wrong. \"ASCII defines a code for each character out of a limited
    set\" -- better.\r\n\"ASCII art on the net uses fixed font\" -- well, yeah. \"ASCII
    art\" is a term for a specific form of art, which <em>needs</em> a fixed font
    to be viewed properly, but other than its name is not inherently linked to ASCII.
    One can make \"EBDIC art\" as well (which, when viewed with an EBDIC aware editor,
    will look just like ASCII art). Presumably we'll going to see Unicode Art somewhere
    in the future.\r\n\r\n<cite>Internationalised domain names e.g. http://idn.icann.org/#The_example.test_names
    use punycode.</cite>\r\n\r\nAs said before, ICANN is looking into allowing (almost)
    any Unicode character in domain names. You'll have to wait for that. I hope you
    can live with the fact that the <em>actual</em> DNS name is still encoded in ASCII
    characters.\r\n\r\nFinally -- the crux of the heart of matter, so to speak:\r\n\r\n<cite>I
    prefer having ASCII letter k/K to be another shape ..</cite>\r\n\r\nASCII characters
    don't have a shape. It's the <em>font</em> which you are using on <em>your</em>
    computer that dictates the shape of character for the Unicode U+004B (generally
    known as \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K\"). If you want to edit all of your fonts, replacing
    the glyph that defines the shape for the letter K with whatever you want.\r\n\r\nOddly,
    this entire discussion seems to boil down to the fact that you do not grasp the
    <em>difference</em> between ASCII (a specific encoding, endorsed by anyone with
    half a brain), the letter K (which has nothing to do with \"ASCII\" in the general
    sense that it's only one of the 96 default characters in that encoding set), and
    fonts in general.\r\n\r\nAs a footnote, I find the glyph \u0918 (Devanagari letter
    Gha) vaguely disturbing. I feel like I'm sitting in a toilet bowl, looking up
    at just the wrong moment. Where can I protest against this glyph and request its
    removal from my computer?"
