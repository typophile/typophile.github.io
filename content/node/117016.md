    Serif]]</strong> by Emigre.\r\nIt looks like a good (if not perfect) match is
    you use some alternates"

  body: "The closest base fonts to my eye are Classic Roman MT http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/classic-roman/
    Pontif http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/pontif/ or a very similar Trajan.
    The faux Medieval touches Such as the X could come from a font like Mason Serif
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mason-ot/ which has it as an alternate letter,
    or from Avqest http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest or it might simply be
    a little creative design work.\r\nDon"

  body: "Unfortunately there is no standard way of accessing the open-type features
    (such as alternate glyphs) of an OTF (open-type) font. It depends on the application
    you are using and there are some Apps which still doesn't support open type features.\r\n\r\nYou
    can read how to use them in Microsoft Word 2010 or later here:\r\nhttp://www.magpiepaperworks.com/blog/wedding-tutorials/using-opentype-fonts-in-microsoft-word/\r\n\r\nand
    there is some information about open type features in Adobe Illustrator here:\r\nhttp://mediamilitia.com/taking-type-to-the-next-level-with-alternate-characters/\r\n"
