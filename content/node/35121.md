body: I have created a True Type font from some bitmapped icons my client supplied.
  They need these icons in a font file to use in their GIS mapping application. If
  the icons were ONE colour, this excercise would be easy BUT... the icons they have
  are MULTIPLE colours. Does anyone know how to "Lock" colours right into a font character?
  For example, one icon is of a building. The building has a black outline, brown
  inside and yellow inside the windows. I don't know how to save the true type character
  with these exact RGB colours. It only wants to save it as black. Does anyone know
  if this can be done? I would be thankful for any advice / tips that can be offered
  to me. thanks!

    One possibility: You could look into <a href=http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/>photofonts</a>,
    which are a relatively new phenomenon. Honestly, I''ve never used a photofont,
    so I can''t comment on their feasibility, but it could be what you''re looking
    for. There are some examples at photofont.com . '

    type two glyphs and color them differently. You may then include this combination
    as a standard sequence into document templates. This will not work that well with
    many colors or halftones, but still a possibility. \r\n"
