    Perhaps he did this as custom font for Oprah's magazine?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This is Wyatt, designed by Paul Barnes for the redesign of <cite>O, The Oprah
    Magazine</cite> by our friends at [[http://www.priestandgrace.com|Priest + Grace]],
    which just launched this past week with the September issue. You can see a little
    more info [[http://commercialtype.com/news/26|here.]] We're hoping to get some
    images up on our Facebook page soon, as well.\r\n\r\nThe redesign uses Wyatt along
    with Kris Sowersby's National and Matthew Carter's Miller Text.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    <cite>O</cite> did use Narziss for their special 10-year anniversary issue, but
    that was a special one-off."
