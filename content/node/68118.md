  body: "Harry \u2014 Welcome. I\u2019ve just taken a look at your <a href=\"http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/\">Web
    Design +</a> document. Lots of good stuff there. I have two typographic quibbles
    for you. \r\n\r\n<strong>(1)</strong> In \xA710.1, you offer this about the Em:
    \u201Ca relative measure defined as <em>A unit of measurement used in typesetting,
    approximately the width of the letter \u2018m\u2019</em>.\u201D This is an oft-repeated,
    but completely bogus definition. \r\n\r\nThe value of an em has nothing to do
    with the width of the letter \u2018m\u2019. The traditional definition is \u201Ca
    relative measure equal to the point size of the type in question.\u201D You might
    enjoy <a href=\"http://type101.fontbureau.com/archives/36\">this essay on the
    Em</a> by type designer Cyrus Highsmith.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be hard pressed to
    find a typeface with an \u2018m\u2019 that measure anywhere near an em. You\u2019ll
    have slightly better luck finding an \u2018M\u2019 that is <em>approximately</em>
    an em in width. But that definition is still apocryphal.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your
    section shows an adequate understanding of the em; it\u2019s just this definition
    which is a pet peeve of mine. \r\n\r\n<strong>(2)</strong> In \xA710.3 iii, you
    state \u201CAn ellipsis is commonly mistaken for three full-stops, when in actual
    fact it is a whole character unto itself.\u201D This is not entirely true.\r\n\r\nWhile
    there may be very good reasons to advocate the use of the encoded composite ellipsis
    character, this argument is not in the same class as the others. Proper quotations
    marks are semantically different from primes. En & em dashes have distinctly different
    roles from hyphens, et al. The same is not true, however, for the ellipsis vs.
    three full stops.\r\n\r\nHistorically and traditionally, an ellipsis in text \u2014
    that is, an omission or a sudden shift in thought\_\u2014\_has been represented
    by three full stops. You will not find a metal sort that is three periods cast
    together. There is no place for such a sort in a type case. You will not find
    a keyboard position on a Linotype or Monotype machine for an ellipsis character.
    \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t be absolutely certain about phototypesetting; but I\u2019m
    pretty sure that the concept of a separate ellipsis glyph is recent and digital.
    It is not an editorial or grammatical development.\r\n\r\nAs I say, there are
    very good reasons to use a non-breaking encoded ellipsis glyph in web pages. But
    the use of three full stops is not semantically incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe [often poorly
    considered] design of the ellipsis glyph in digital fonts is a separate discussion.
    We\u2019ve had lively debates about the ellipsis before. For instance, see http://typophile.com/node/42278.\r\n\r\nSome
    will think me old-fashioned for clinging to some of these minor points, but you\u2019re
    young and bright, and I thought you should be presented with this perspective.\r\n\r\n\u2014
    K."

    can be incredibly addictive! And as illustrated by Kent also incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nThank
    you Kent for those insights. I thought the name of the Em dash referenced some
    historical relationship to the M. Glad to be corrected!"

  body: "Riccardo \u2014 I'm not sure what the impetus would be for \u201Cinventing\u201D
    a composed ellipsis for advanced typewriters. \r\n\r\nI quickly checked a few
    references for the Selectric series and I didn\u2019t see any evidence that they
    went beyond ASCII in their character sets. Perhaps some other did.\r\n\r\nI think
    the only value of a pre-composed ellipsis comes when you have a computer making
    the line-break choices (and no way to tell it that three spaced full stops should
    not break). I believe that even the most advanced justifying typewriters still
    relied on human operators to make decisions about line breaks."
