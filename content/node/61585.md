  anyone know what font is that. I've been looking around and found a font that is
  similar called Zag but this most likely to be better. Anyone have any suggestion
  or alternative for this kind of font that has yin / yang element? \r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot-92_4332.jpg]"
