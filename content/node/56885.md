body: Our school's socio-political publication currently uses Georgia (9 pts!) for
  its text. I know, it's a headache, and the leading isn't that good either. Everyone
  has been complaining that it's difficult to read. It looks exceptionally stale,
  too (white space problems, mostly). So, a friend (a member in the publication organization)
  asked me to have a list of recommended replacements for their current text typeface.
  So far, I can only think of Brioni Text, probably at 8 to 8.5 pts. Any ideas? Thanks.

    you going to address the typography issues too? :)"

    but I exert my influence through my friend. :p\r\nWe're talking about it right
    now. Brioni might be too expensive, so we're looking at Karmina.\r\n\r\nAnd of
    course. I'm really OC with those things. :)"
