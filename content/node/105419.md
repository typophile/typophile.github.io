body: "I have a text with some ligatures. When I try to delete a part of a ligature
  strange things happen (all samples in InDesign 5, font EB Garamond OTF/CFF by Georg
  Duffner):\r\n1. Ligature longs_longs_t. I want to delete the \"t\" character; placed
  the cursor after \"t\" and hit 'backspace'. Unluckily ALL my ligature disappeared!\r\n2.
  Ligature f_f. I did the same and magically ONLY second\"f\" disappeared. What a
  confusion.\r\nPrintscreen 1\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/del_test2_4627.jpg]\r\nPrintscreen
  2\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/del_test1_3907.jpg]\r\nI found some info:
  http://fontforge.org/editexample4.html :\r\n\"Some word processors will allow the
  editing caret to be placed inside a ligature (with a caret position between each
  component of the ligature). This means that the user of that word processor does
  not need to know s/he is dealing with a ligature and sees behavior very similar
  to what s/he would see if the components were present. But if the word processor
  is to be able to do this it must have some information from the font designer giving
  the locations of appropriate caret positions.\"\r\nLet's try to select a character
  in our ligatures:\r\nPrintscreen 3\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caret_test2_5533.jpg]\r\nPrintscreen
  4\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caret_test1_5484.jpg]\r\nIt looks like
  \"f_f\" have \"ligature caret' information, \"longs_longs_t\" have not.\r\nActually:\r\nPrintscreen
  5\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liga_caret_5778.jpg]\r\nSo it is up to
  font designer. For example Luc[as] writes: http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=8778.msg29007#msg29007\r\nSome
  remarks?\r\n\r\n"

    to set the ligature caret in all of them. I'll probably be double checking as

    In case any particular ligature is missing caret placement data, text shapers
    usually divide the ligature\u2019s advance width between the number of its character
    components and use that as the caret positions. It\u2019s not some heuristics
    but a mere equal division, so obviously this doesn\u2019t always work well. Still,
    it\u2019s better than nothing, especially when it\u2019s so rare for a font to
    have any ligature caret data at all. HarfBuzz, as far as I know, does this, so
    does CoreText. Not sure about others."

  body: 'If a single backspace is deleting the entire ''longs_longs_t'' ligature,
    that suggests to me that something other than the underlying three-letter character
    codes was stored in the text: either a PUA codepoint or possible a raw GID. This
    could depend on how the ligature was input in the first place.'

    you can see InD ignores ligature caret info, splits are (probably) based on advance
    widths of underlying letters. What a pity that Adobe does not support the specification. "
