body: I dearly wish that we could have RoboFog for glyph design. This is a plead to
  LetteRerror to update your program to OS ten. We are not asking you to upgrade the
  font coding. Just the program to work.

    know what you\u2019re asking as this is not a trivial thing at all. Robofog is
    dead, live with it.\r\n\r\n-Paul"

  body: Tomi, I'm intrigued. What does RoboFog do that Fontlab/RoboFab don't do? Maybe
    its functions could be incorporated easier into FL???

    was a hack of Fontographer 3.5 which is no longer available and requires more
    hacks to run on Intel macs. Fontographer 4 is all that we have now; it was a complete
    rewrite of the program, broke RoboFog, etc. etc.. To make it happen the programmers
    would have to hack the crap out of Fog 4.x, which doesn\u2019t work well anyway.\r\n\r\nYou
    could always donate money to the development of Glyphs, which is probably more
    up your alley than FLab: http://schriftgestaltung.de/glyphs/about.html"
