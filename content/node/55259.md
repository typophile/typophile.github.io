  publish it.\r\nI am looking for a similar one. Any idea?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OpTheatre7_5825.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank

    it down.\r\nLook at that screenshot, the font from Mark hold it very well - each
    dot are exactly 2x2 pixels.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Comparaison_6704.jpg]"

  body: "Making the font with FontStruct is quite a task (+ I am not good enough).\r\n\r\nThe
    dotted fonts are\u2026 well\u2026 made of dots, plain cercles. Mark's font is
    made of squares, it hold very very well at small scale.\r\nI found gazillions
    of pixels fonts but none with that look and feel."

    you've studied the structure of Mark Coleran's lettering closely FontStruct should
    not be difficult at all. A square is the default building block, plus having those
    spaces between the 2x2 squares will make it a lot easier to copy and paste sections
    between different letters. What is great is you can make the font in stages. Start
    just doing the letters you need. You can go back any time and eventually make
    as full a set of glyphs as you want."
