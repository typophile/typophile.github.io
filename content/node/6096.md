body: Hi all!  This may have been posted before, but I am new to the site.  I tried
  to do a search, but a search for &#34;the gap&#34; produces way too many irrelevant
  results.  <BR> <BR>Can someone please help me identify the typeface used in &#34;the
  gap&#34; logo?  Old or new would be fab, both would be even BETTER. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  much!
