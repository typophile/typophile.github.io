		<div class="commentbody">To me Gill's little book is very serious. It puts type in the context of society, exposing some deeply-rooted problems. The fact that many people today might think it's &quot;strange&quot; is simply that we've been brainwashed into loving industrialization over the past 100 years. I think when Gill's book came out, there were a lot more people who &quot;got it&quot;. <BR> <BR>According to the colophon*, &quot;Essay&quot; was in fact the first use of Joanna. And the later 1936 edition was set in foundry, not Monotype. <BR> <BR>* It has two: one on page 4 and one at the end. I'm not sure the first one can be called a &quot;colophon&quot;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Type &amp; typography</i> by Phil Baines and Andrew Haslem is a great book for beginners as well as those with more experience. It approaches type first and foremost from the linguistic point of view in a section called 'function', then move onto 'form', where history and classification are discussed in great details. The third section is about the designing and manufacturing of type. The next section is titled 'Structure', where hierarchy, grid, and the fine points about setting type are covered. The last section is 'Conventions', the 'rules' of setting text type, if you will. The whole book is illustrated throughout with relevant and engaging examples, The main running text set in Swift in a large point size and 'sidebars' set in a smaller Meta that goes into more depth about each issue discussed. I highly recommend this book. I think it's one of the best, most comprehensive and least biased I've seen so far. It is quite a brilliant achievement: it has a lot of depth and students are going to <i>like</i> reading it because it actually <i>looks</i> so interesting. Along with Bringhurst, it's going to be required reading for my type class.</div>

Maybe the best single &quot;textbook&quot; out there. <BR> <BR>The only thing that bugs me is that they go to all that wonderful trouble of setting up typography with speech, writing and all, but&hellip; did you notice&hellip; <i>nothing</i> about how we actually <i>read</i>! :-/  The whole point, really. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; i'm one of those people who aren't bothered by subtitles in films. <BR> <BR>I'm envious. I have a lot of trouble watching a foreign movie in a language I know because I can't help reading the subtitles. Same thing with the opera these days - those stinky surtitles - guys, you're supposed to know the story before you get there anyway, you know?! The point in opera is the delivery. And to me the only really good thing about DVDs is that you can turn the subtitles off. I even like watching foreign movies that I <i>can't</i> understand - they often make more sense that way. Like before I knew Spanish I enjoyed Mexican TV much more. And one time I was watching Ran, and I called the station yelling at them to turn of the subtitles&hellip; <BR> <BR>Now <i>I'm</i> getting out of hand&hellip; <BR> <BR>One thing I found definitely kind of innovative in Ruder's book is that page where they compare regular and irregular spacing of letters of different structures, with carefully selected words set large. That was sharp. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
