body: Hello, everyone. This is my fist posting to the forum. I&#39;ve been reading
  this forum for a few weeks and have learned quite a bit from your critiques. Thanks!
  <BR> <BR>I am currently designing a logo for a progressive non-profit, for their
  new leadership-development program. they have already settled on the name, which
  refers to this resource network &#40;of 4 parts&#41;... unfortunately i couldn&#39;t
  talk them out of using &#34;matrix&#34; since that word has been killed. <BR> <BR>I
  am soliciting any feedback that you may offer, the more brutally honest the better.
  On this forum I have watched some pretty mediocre designs begin to sing after the
  valuable critiques provided by all of you. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to hear which direction&#40;s&#41;
  have the most potential, and any ideas with integrating the &#34;matrix.&#34; Thanks
  in advance. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20908.gif"

  body: Benjamin, Could you explain what the E stands for. The non-profit probably
    knows but I don&#39;t, and why a Matrix. A little more explaination will help.
    Do you have to use E or can you use a full word? Can you spell out 4? Are these
    the set colors or experiments? How are you going to use the logo, on-line, print?

  body: From what little I know about this, and what you have presented, I like the
    direction of the last concept. The intersecting shapes have some strong potential,
    but it&#39;s very important to keep them legible. Let&#39;s see more exploration
    on that shape. The italicized &#34;matrix&#34; needs to go. If their market is
    corporate &#40;especially execs&#41;, then &#34;matrix&#34; is an excellent word.
    The suits love to use matrix. I&#39;ll be watching.

    leadership is about being strong, inventive but also humane, so a semi-organic
    thing with a two firmly interlocking parts feels right. And if you make it angular&#42;
    the idea of &#34;matrix&#34; might carry through, even though it&#39;s not a grid

    appropriate to the organization. Just be careful. The more playful the less timeless
    it can become. &#40;If timelessness is a requirement, which is usually should

    e4, i dont really think this is a problem. I think that the shapes are such a
    strong form that even if people dont notice at first its a strong enough image
    to stick in peoples heads. Then when they notice that its an e and a four they
    will go &#39;oooo!&#39; Quite afew TV companies in UK have logos like this and
    I dont think they suffer for it.  <BR>Perhaps you could even say e4 matrix under
    the logo or employ the idea above &#40;see below&#41;. What I&#39;m really tryin
    to say is that I hope you dont back away from this design becuase of an&#40;imho&#41;
    unjustified thought that people might not see what it says. I think its a great
    deign &#40;Scotts rotation has really put the icing on the cake&#41;.  <BR><img

    <BR>That being said, e4 will be promoted primarily through word of mouth or personal

  body: I&#39;m sure someone will disagree with me, but I have to say there are no
    rules about placement. You should leave it open and call it situation dependant.
    For instance, You could even use the logo and the wordtype in two different places.
    With the letterhead, another for instance, the logo could be off to the side toward
    the top and the wordtype could be used with the address somehow. If you believe
    they should be used together, I would probably opt for one of those without the
    E4 ... or ... where the two E4s aren&#39;t right next to each other. I&#39;m guilty
    of not following this entire thread, but I enjoy this solution. Edgy, clever ...
    without being cute or over-the-top. I love the acid green too. &#40;or that is

    <BR>As for placement, I would side with the argument that you should provide a
    handful of variations. Give them some flexibility, but don&#39;t let them go nuts.
    <BR> <BR>If you leave it with the full &#39;E 4 M A T R I X&#39; spelled out,
