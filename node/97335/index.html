  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I'm attempting to identify a font that appears in the cover graphics on the covers and spines of original editions of Everyman's Library. These appeared in the 1906-1928 period, incorporated into graphics designed by Reginald Knowles. I've tried to find a specific font but to no avail. It is possible this was a font designed specifically for the graphics, or a combination of more than one font. On the other had, it may be well known, but I can't figure it out, and have not found any information online. I have scanned some of the artwork; the artwork looks a little rough (gold gilt impressed into a leatherette surface), though it is possible this was done intentionally for a rustic look. I've isolated a few lines end removed most of the surround artwork. I'm looking to clean up the artwork and lettering as part of a project I'm working on, and any help identifying the fot would be greatly appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">It's possible, looking at it again I see that "Everyman" (as in Everyman's Library) is a slightly different and more formal font, while the rest of it is a little more cassual. If I get the chance I'll post the second line of text tomorrow, but it is possible it is hand-done for the original artwork, and I may just have to mix and match characters from existing fonts. The tops of the "L"s going off to the right is something I didn't see in many fonts in my original search... I know nothing about fonts myself, but if this is a common thing and has a common name, let me know and it might help me identify it. Thanks,

		<div class="commentbody">The most similar font I could find was Nick Curtis's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/gandy-dancer-nf/|Gandy Dancer NF]], his revival of an old ATF face called Tabard, from 1912. Other sort of similar styles were Fonthead's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/el-franco/|El Franco]] a recreation of 16th century lettering; and A Scholtz fonts number called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/figment/|Figment]]. I tried to pick hand-made-looking type, like your sample.

I agree with Dick that the cover lettering you posted seems hand-made, possibly a lino cut.

		<div class="commentbody">The original scan was from a heavily textured leather-type book cover material, so some of the hand-made quality may be a result of that. Of course, since they knew it would go onto a heavily textured surface, they probably weren't so worried about how perfect the letters were on the original engraving. I'll look at the fonts you suggested.

		<div class="commentbody">...and of course it's only after I go to all the trouble that I find a reference in A Companion to the History of the Book to the hand-lettered titles and art of Reginald Knowles. So that answers that question... probably based on a real font, but customized to fit the page. Thanks all!
