body: "Hello - \r\n\r\nI try to add some characters (with FontLab\xAE) into an existing
  .TTF font (eg. \"\xE7\xC7\", \u2026). In fact it's a font with many separated weight
  (each weight is a .TTF file) \r\nWhen I export each file (after formated it as OTF
  table) everything goes well. \r\nBut, when All the fonts are installed, well only
  see one of them into Adobe\xAE Illustrator\xAE font menu. \r\n\r\nHow is that possible?
  \r\n\r\nNB. I checked all the fonts with FontDoctor\xAE, and No font problems were
  diagnosed! \r\nThank you, have a nice day\u2026 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Dimitri     http://www.thebend.be/"
