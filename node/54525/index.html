  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I am new to this forum, and found it through a search engine searching for logo critiques. I have been doing web design for a long time now, and usually do okay with the design aspect of things, but am struggling with logos.</p>
<p>My church needs a whole new identity. I have created a simple logo, but am not sure if its good or not. I feel that it is very old school, doesn&rsquo;t really look anything like the new age stuff.</p>
<p>I was trying to capture the aspect of the hilltop, and the crosses to resemble being a church. If someone could please give me some tips, and possibly even a new typeface to use. Really any suggestions are open. Please help!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This isn&rsquo;t really original in any way. You need to go brainstorming, and then pick up a pencil and start sketching out some ideas. Maybe you should abstract a cross somehow, maybe you want to work with a hill as your symbol, perhaps just writing the name out in a good looking way (without any symbol)? Are there something about you that make you unique? Are there any christian symbolic images you can use, like coming to the &ldquo;table&rdquo;, hearing the &ldquo;message&rdquo; and so on … ?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ve got so far is Nike church:)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree. It doesn&rsquo;t look bad, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the sort of distinctiveness yet that makes logos memorable, and makes them a cogent visualization —and voice— of the institutions they represent.</p>
<p>What I do when I start out with a new logo is try to find out what &ldquo;tone&rdquo; it should have, in what kind of a voice it should speak: loud or soft? Strong or smooth? Professional or fun? Like Frode said: What makes this church unique, what is its voice? Making a list of adjectives can help in defining the desired &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the logo (and of the font used along with it).</p>
<p>BTW, I was wondering if this is some sort of group of three churches / religions, one large and two small, as symbolized by the three crosses? (I don&rsquo;t see a church there, sorry :-| )
In a logo, everything has meaning; question every element, and leave only those in that <em>need</em> to be there.</p>
<p>Also, it would probably help to leave out color and gradients for now. Working in black &amp; white only forces you to look for treatments that are original in a truly &ldquo;graphic&rdquo; way, and that also work in media/situations where no color can be used (the famous fax, inter alia); and once you work the color back in after you&rsquo;ve found a formal solution that works, it will enhance it even more.</p>
