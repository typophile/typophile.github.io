  body: I thought maybe this was an example of Linotype's new <a href="http://www.linotype.com/8-36-8-17894/standardglyphstheiralternates.html">Zapfino
    Extra</a>, with all the alternates and OpenType bells & whistles. However, that
    'q' still doesn't quite match up ... I think Lex is right about the slight customization.

  body: "I agree with Lex too. The tail of the Zapfino One 'q' has just been clipped
    off. See the whole family of Zapfinos, including Forte, in the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script04Pg13.html\"
