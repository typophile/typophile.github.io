body: "Rotis, the village is about 15 miles away from where I live and was born. I
  never got to know Otl Aicher. He died before I heard of his work. The typeface Rotis
  was later always part of my typografic life, because I discussed it a lot. To be
  honest for a long time I hated it. But what I hated much more was the theory Otl
  Aicher built arround it. \r\nI am still getting angry now, when I see so many designers
  and architects following him without much critique.\r\nStill there is something
  about it that interestes me.\r\nA few years ago I started to draw a new interpretation
  of the Rotis idea, because there was a potential client that wanted a headline face
  in this direction. It never happened, but I went on with it. \r\nI started it from
  zero, never used any outline of the Rotis fonts. \r\nThe first thing you can see
  is, that it is not condensed. That never really worked in Rotis.\r\n\r\nAt the end
  there are not many elements left that remind on Rotis, accept the often discussed
  e and c. The stroke is oldstyle while the rest of the forms are neoclassically upright.
  I kept it in my first version.\r\nBecause it follow two different concepts in the
  stroke I made two alternate versions. One with an angled axis, called the oldstyle
  stroke version and one with an upright axis called the neoclassical stroke version.\r\n\r\nI
  want to ask you a two questions:\r\n1. Do you think it has got enought character
  to live a life next to Rotis?\r\n2. Would you do extra fonts, or Open Type styles
  for the alternate versions?\r\n\r\nI have never based my fonts as near to an existing
  design as in this case. So I am quite eager to hear what you think.\r\n\r\nHubert"

  body: "I don't have much insight into your 2 questions, but I will admit that I
    love the work you've done so far.\r\n\r\nIt feels like a more robust Rotis. The
    ampersand is back to normal; even sophisticated looking. I especially enjoy the
    @, registered and copyright symbols. \r\n\r\nI don't know if your tracking is
    quite right yet, especially the spacing between words, which feels too wide. \r\n\r\nthe
    lowercase a is very elegant. The lowercase f however doesn't seem dense enough,
    and I'd like to see the lowercase t with an angled top like in Rotis.\r\n\r\nThe
    uppercase Q and R are nice, but they don't share the same unique feel of Rotis's
    Q and R.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that sets your characters apart from Rotis, is that
    some of your strokes end outward, were Rotis's would end downward. Such as in
    a, c, y, 2, 3, 6, and 9. I don't know if this a true argument as much as it is
    an observation.\r\n\r\nVery nice work Hubert."

    There are still very few modern sans families with contrast. There is room for
    more.\r\n\r\n> 2. Would you do extra fonts, or Open Type styles for the alternate
    versions?\r\n\r\nI would definitely do OT for those who are using Adobe CS. But
    [[Mark Simonson]] has a nice solution for those customers who might not be using
    OT-savvy apps: bundle both options: a full featured OT with the alts, and separated
    OT fonts."

  body: "The next thing I started with Legau is a bit more extreme, but it also deals
    with angles of the stroke.\r\nIn one of my serifs I flipped the angle of the stroke
    to the right in most of the round characters.\r\nhttp://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/serif/Leaf/\r\nthe
    same concept I now brought into Legau.\r\nI will also upload another pdf to show

    Rotis? As a visual designer who is also studying architecture, your comment intrigued
    me.

  body: "thanks to both of you for your comments. after reading \"Is Rotis a typeface?\"
    i can definitely see echoes of the same problem within the field of architecture
    - people espouse a theory, but what they produce using that theory is not what
    they say it is.\r\n\r\nthat said, i agree that Rotis is great for titles, headlines,
    and logos, but have never felt ok about using it to set large blocks of text.
    taken individually, i think that the letterforms are quite beautiful.\r\n"
