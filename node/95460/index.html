  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It seems that the Adobe Devanagari font was not yet discussed at Typophile.</p>
<p>I had a closer technical look at AdobeDevanagari-Regular.otf, version 1.105 (2011), and here are my findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Latin diacritics required for transliterating Indic (Hindi, Sanskrit, etc.) texts is incomplete. The diacritic for &ldquo;sh&rdquo; (both lowercase and uppercase), very frequently used in Indic words, e.g. in Shiva etc., is missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many frequently used ligatures are missing, even ligatures which have a frequency of much more than 0.01 %, e.g. &ldquo;ddhv&rdquo; (frequency 0.215 %).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For details see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures.pdf</a></p>
<p>For comparison see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf</a> (page 29 seq.)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Adobe Devanagari font does not work with older Windows and older Word.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, Adobe Devanagari does not work with old Microsoft Word, version 10, in conjunction with Windows XP.</p>
<p>For comparison, Mangal and all the other Devanagari Unicode fonts known to me work with older Word and older Windows, provided the Uniscribe system library for foreign language support was installed with Windows.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The first thing that should be noted is that Adobe Devanagari was designed specifically for modern Hindi use, and not for Sanskrit; it may be of limited use even for other modern languages such as Marathi and Nepali. The design brief was specifically to target use of Hindi in a modern business environment (the font was originally made to bundle with Acrobat), and not scholarly use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That could be an oversight. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See note above re. target language support. The ligature set was based on a mixed approach: referencing the set employed in Linotype Devanagari (on which Fiona also worked) and also frequency analysis of modern Hindi text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct. The font uses only the newer &lsquo;dev2&rsquo; script tag and layout behaviour, not the older, deprecated <deva> shaping. This is what Adobe spec&rsquo;d. Hence the font will not work in pre-Vista versions of Windows or other environments that only support &lsquo;deva&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><strong>A) &gt; Adobe Devanagari was designed specifically for modern Hindi use, and not for Sanskrit</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay, but a circumspect designer, adding only a few additional ligatures could make the font also suitable for Marathi and Sanskrit. For example, for Classical Sanskrit, only 11 additional ligatures would be required to make the Adobe Devanagari font suitable for Classical Sanskrit (as opposed to Vedic Sanskrit).</p>
<p>see file adobe-ligatures.pdf (see the missing ligatures marked with &ldquo;!!!&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>B) &gt; That could be an oversight</strong></p>
<p>The oversight was due to the fact that most Indic diacritics are in the Unicode range 1E0C through 1E96, with the exception of</p>
<p>015A Sacute
015B sacute</p>
<p>which are used in Polish texts, but which happen to be used also as Indic diacritics.</p>
<p><strong>C) &gt; The design brief was specifically to target use of Hindi</strong></p>
<p>If this should be the case, then there must have been made design errors.</p>
<p>(Cave: I am not a Hindi expert, so that a scholar should examine the following)</p>
<p>(a) On the one hand, it seems to me (see cave above) that the Adobe Devanagari font INCLUDES ligatures, which are (to my knowledge) NOT used in Hindi (and also NOT used in Sanskrit etc.), for example &ldquo;kspr&rdquo;:</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/kspr-kspl.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/kspr-kspl.jpg</a></p>
<p>Did the Adobe designers invent the ligature &ldquo;kspr&rdquo; just for fun?</p>
<p>(b) On the other hand, it seems to me (see cave above) that the Adobe Devanagari font LACKS ligatures, which are (to my knowledge) USED in Hindi, for example &ldquo;dg&rdquo; in the Hindi word &ldquo;khadga&rdquo; (= &ldquo;sword&rdquo; in English):</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/khadga.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/khadga.jpg</a></p>
<p>In the Oxford Hindi-English dictionary by McGregor published in 1993, the word &ldquo;khadga&rdquo; was typeset with virama, i.e. without ligature, due to the fact that professional Devanagari fonts, such as Siddhanta.ttf and Sanskrit2003.ttf, were not available at that time. But today in the Unicode era, it is possible to design professional Devanagari fonts suited for Hindi.</p>
<p>I wonder whether a Hindi scholar ever checked the Adobe Devanagari font for ligatures
(a) required for Hindi and
(b) not used in Hindi</p>
<p>Instead of including ligatures required for Hindi, the Adobe Devanagari fonts includes a plethora of fancy ikara variants which would only make sense in a font containing the required ligatures.</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/ikara.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/ikara.jpg</a></p>

<p>dga and nga are two different conjuncts

Devanagari glyph). Both Devanagari letters
d and n only differ by the &ldquo;dot&rdquo; to the right.

<p>I know very well that those two are different. I was pointing out that one is listed in the commonest conjuncts (nga), and thus was available in the font, and the one you point out (dga) is not listed. I see no reason a font used in the seventies with nga would not have dga and dga was not listed by McGregor. I conclude that it was intentional on McGregor&rsquo;s part (and not due to a missing glyph).</p>

<p>As far as Sanskrit is concerned, dg has a frequency of 0.167 %, which means that it is very common in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>As far as Hindi is concerned, you will have to supply your own frequency research results, because I am no Hindi expert.</p>
<p>If we discuss the Adobe Devanagari font on the basis of the &ldquo;commonest conjuncts&rdquo;, I think we should forget the Adobe font, because who wants to use a font which includes only the commonest conjuncts? &ldquo;Mangal&rdquo; was such a makeshift font including only the &ldquo;commonest conjuncts&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That is what I mean. The Adobe Devanagari font contains conjuncts which cannot occur in Hindi for linguistic reasons. In Sanskrit, theoretically, &ldquo;kspr&rdquo; could occur by combining a word ending in &ldquo;k&rdquo; with a word beginning with &ldquo;spr&rdquo;, just like combining in English &ldquo;ink&rdquo; with &ldquo;spray&rdquo; to &ldquo;inkspray&rdquo; which would/could contain the &ldquo;kspr-conjunct&rdquo; (in-kspr-ay).  But these are &ldquo;wordplays&rdquo; which do not have a linguistic basis. Therefore, I think, several conjuncts contained in the Adobe Devanagari font were invented just for fun.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some of the conjuncts in the Adobe Devanagari font were inherited from the Linotype Devanagari font, which was used a lot in newspapers and whose glyph set was in part developed in response to requests from newspaper editors in India. It is entirely possible that some conjuncts were intended for commonly transliterated words from other languages.</p>
<p>I do think a more systematic, analytical approach should be taken to defining the conjunct set for Hindi fonts, as Uli has done for Sanskrit. In the case of the Adobe Devanagari, we compiled a set from a variety of sources. We had intended to cover Marathi too, but the development schedule wasn&rsquo;t very long because it needed to be bundled with Acrobat, so we had to prioritise for Adobe&rsquo;s principal targets. We did do testing of extended Hindi texts &ndash; including an entire novel &ndash; and found the font to perform well.</p>
<p>Uli, it is worth bearing in mind that modern Hindi typography has broken quite significantly with the Sanskrit tradition. I understand your comment re. fonts that support only the more common conjunct ligatures, but that seems to me very much the perspective of a Sanskritist: Hindi readers have been used to extensive use of half forms and, for some letters, even explicit halants ever since the hot metal typesetting days. Indeed, when Fiona first reintroduced some of the conjunct ligature forms in the digital LT Devanagari (for the Linotron 202) there was resistance from some Indian customers to what were perceived as &lsquo;Sanskrit&rsquo; forms. A lot of the custom encoding solutions for Hindi fonts, e.g. the Modular Infotech system, remain based around extensive half form use. None of this is to say that we couldn&rsquo;t, with more time and research, have come up with a better Hindi conjunct set for Adobe Devanagari, but that the expectation that any given conjunct, however rare, should be presented in its ligature form is not one that Hindi readers share with you.</p>
<p>Thank you, by the way, for the very helpful review documents, which I&rsquo;ll certainly examine carefully and I hope will help us to do better in future.</p>

<li>Mr. Boyer:</li>
</ol>
<p>I discovered that by Edwin Greaves in his 1921 Hindi Grammar</p>
<p>see <a href="http://archive.org/details/hindigrammar00greauoft">http://archive.org/details/hindigrammar00greauoft</a></p>
<p>the ligature &ldquo;dg&rdquo; is reckoned as a &ldquo;principal compound&rdquo;.</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/dga.jpg">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/dga.jpg</a></p>
<p>This book by Greaves has also an interesting introduction describing &ldquo;High Hindi&rdquo; as a language &ldquo;for those who delight to cram their pages with high-sounding Sanskrit words&rdquo; (see page 4 of the scanned book). But this was 90 years ago.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Mr. Hudson:</li>
</ol>
<p>I did not say that I have &ldquo;the expectation that any given conjunct, however rare, should be presented in its ligature form&rdquo;.  On the contrary, I said that &ldquo;only 11 additional ligatures would be required to make the Adobe Devanagari font suitable for Classical Sanskrit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What I criticize is that the Adobe Devanagari font contains many extremely infrequent and perhaps entirely unattestable ligatures, whereas this font lacks very frequent ligatures, at least as far as Sanskrit is concerned.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Mr. Boyer and Mr. Hudson:</li>
</ol>
<p>I made a <strong>complete</strong> compound analysis of the Adobe Devanagari font, which will be of interest to Mr. Boyer and to Mr. Hudson:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures-analysis.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures-analysis.pdf</a></p>
<p>The frequency counts are based on Sanskrit texts developed for Sanskrit fonts, but these statistics may be also of help for Hindi-only fonts.</p>
<p>The most infrequent or rarest, though attestable, Sanskrit compounds have a frequency of 0.001 %.  This means that in 100000 (one hundred thousand) lines of Sanskrit texts, this compound occurs only ONCE on an average.</p>
<p>Now, if Mr. Boyer applies his Gnu Hindi dictionary word count utility to the compounds listed on pages 27 through 37 of the above file (adobe-ligatures-analysis.pdf) containing the rarest or most infrequent Sanskrit ligatures (0.001%), I predict that Mr. Boyer is sure to discover that innumerable ligatures (compounds), which are indeed contained in the Adobe Devanagari font cannot be attested (i.e. located or found) in his Hindi dictionary. If this be true (let&rsquo;s see), this would mean that the Adobe Devanagari font contains innumerable unattested compounds (ligatures) with a frequency of 0.000 % (nil, nothing).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli, as noted, Sanskrit was not a target language for the Adobe Devanagari font. It is entirely possible that Adobe will want to extend its glyph set coverage for other languages, but I suspect that modern languages such as Marathi, Konkani and Nepali would be their priorities. I&rsquo;m a little surprised that you reckon only eleven more conjunct ligatures would be needed for classical Sanskrit; I would think more.</p>
<p>Fiona confirms that some of the conjuncts inherited from the Linotype set were for transliteration of foreign words; we included them in Adobe Devanagari because the Linotype fonts are a recognised standard among some Indian customers, and to deviate from the set would be to invite criticism and require explanation. Instead, we get criticism from a German Sanskritist and have to explain to him. :)</p>
<p>The core sets on which the Adobe Devanagari set are based were the Linotype Devanagari (for compatibility with a perceived &lsquo;standard&rsquo;) and that provided by <a href="http://hindiurduflagship.org/">Rupert Snell</a> in his Hindi grammar, which is the most up-to-date source for the modern language. Recently, we had occasion to add some extra variants for one of Adobe&rsquo;s customers who wanted different forms for certain conjuncts.</p>
<p>Greaves' comment about &lsquo;High Hindi&rsquo; is worth bearing in mind. You cite खड्ग as an example of the &lsquo;dg&rsquo; conjunct in Hindi, but the common modern Hindi word for sword is तलवार.</p>
<p>Clearly Michel is not going to find &lsquo;innumerable&rsquo; conjuncts in Adobe Devanagari that do not occur in Hindi words: he is going to find a precise number, and these will all be conjuncts that also appeared in the Linotype set. Far from being &lsquo;invented just for fun&rsquo;, they were included in a set whose size was limited by technical restraints at the request of Linotype&rsquo;s Indian customers, in order to cleanly (without explicit halant) render transliterations of common foreign words in Hindi newspapers. In the context of those newspapers, it is entirely likely that some foreign words would be more common than those Hindi words that contain low frequency conjuncts. [Transliteration of foreign words, especially proper names, was a major factor for newspaper typesetting in the Subcontinent. Full-word ligatures needed to be added to Urdu fonts whenever the Soviet Union had a change of leaders.]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli: <em>From the scholarly point of view, I think that it is ridiculous to invent unique ligatures for proper names.</em></p>
<p>From a scholarly point of view, I agree, but these conjunct ligatures were made at the request of <em>newspaper publishers,</em> who are perennially concerned with column width and word length, and for whom being able to reduce the width of commonly occurring words through ligation was a practical benefit (especially if you bear in mind that newsprint was rationed in India for long periods of the 20th Century). Linotype were not &lsquo;cashing in on selling unique ligatures&rsquo;: you are entirely misunderstanding the nature of the commercial relationship between newspapers and typesetting machine manufacturers at that time. Newspapers invested in <em>machines,</em> and the makers of those machines provided fonts according to the specifications of the newspaper publishers. It is not as if Linotype invented these conjunct ligatures and offered them for sale to the newspapers; rather, the newspaper publishers and editors who had purchased the Linotype typesetting machinery requested the addition of these ligatures to their fonts.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re at a point in the development of Indic fonts now where we should reasonably consider whether these legacy transliteration ligatures, which were developed at a particular point in time for a particular technology and particular customer base, should be ignored. As I reported earlier, we included them in Adobe Devanagari because of concerns that users in India familiar with the Linotype sets might consider the Adobe set deficient if it did not include them. This sort of thing happens in situations in which the only reference that many people have for judging the quality of a new font is comparison with previous fonts. We encounter this regularly. I think, Uli, that you and Michel are on entirely the right track with frequency analysis: this is a much better basis on which to plan glyph sets, and in line with what we&rsquo;re doing these days (bear in mind that although Adobe Devanagari was only recently released we actually made it more than four years ago).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is very useful, Michel. I think the problems at the bottom of page 10 and on page 11 must be encoding issues in the dictionary: whenever you see Uniscribe inserting a dotted circle into the leftmost column, that indicates a character sequence considered invalid, e.g. a vowel followed by a virama. These entries should be ignored.</p>
<p>I wonder if you might be able to run the same test on the <a href="http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/hi-demo.tar.gz">Hunspell Hindi dictionary</a>? And perhaps a combined test of the two dictionaries (having removed duplicate word entries)?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d very much appreciate having your analysis in a spreadsheet format: when I try to copy and paste from the PDF, some Devanagari letters show up as unknown characters.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>I</em>, for one, certainly don&rsquo;t dispute the appropriateness of Adobe using real-world marketing considerations as a guide to the design of its fonts.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that it would not also be nice, if by the addition of a limited number of additional glyphs, the font could be made usable for other languages using the Devanagari script besides Hindi, to add those glyphs. After all, as things stand now, it should really be called a Hindi font and not a Devanagari font - just as a font not including the characters for typesetting, say, Serbian ought to be called a Russian font and not a Cyrillic font.</p>
<p>Thus, to be able to set Sanskrit after a fashion, and Hindi well - by including ligatures for foreign words commonly transliterated in Hindi - would be good. And the other point raised, that a limited number of glyphs are missing that are at least shown by dictionaries as used by Hindi - <em>if</em>, indeed, the number is limited, then perhaps they should be added as well. This, though, is less important - as here we are talking about ligatures, to which virama is always an alternative.</p>
<p>As for the example above, yes, dga is different from nga, since the former doesn&rsquo;t have a dot - but since omitting a dot is much easier than drawing a new character from scratch, if nga is included, then since dga comes cheaply from a design point of view, unless the size of the font comes at a premium, dga <em>ought</em> to be included if the language could call for it.</p>
<p>So I think that while the criticism of Adobe adding useless ligatures just for fun can be thrown out, some of the other objections seem to have enough merit that, if, on examination, they really do call for nothing more than the addition of a very limited number of glyphs, they could  be highly constructive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t have the Adobe Devanagari font and can&rsquo;t comment on it. Uli&rsquo;s analysis contains 821 compound glyphs. For the aspell dictionary, I made my analysis by first replacing all letters followed by a nukta by the corresponding precomposed character. On 475108 bigrams, there were only two &ldquo;u092F nukta&rdquo; and that many for others (number of occurrences between parentheses)</p>
<p>u0915 (316), u0916 (411), u0917 (157), u091C (673), u0921 (1789), u0922 (395), u092B (391)</p>
<p>I then just searched for the longest sequences of the form</p>
<pre>
    letter virama letter virama … virama letter 
</pre>
<p>and found 627 glyphs to be precompounded  to eliminate occurrences of virama that are not at the end of a word. From the analysis, one sees that 211 compounds would be required by only one occurrence in the dictionary and only 356 compounds occur in more than two entries. You can find my results in the files on my blog:</p>
<p><a href="/files/compounds_20120812b.pdf">/files/compounds_20120812b.pdf</a></p>
<p>I think I see bugs with vowels (bottom of page 10). I would need the right &ldquo;regular expression&rdquo; that characterizes possible conjuncts (or is it a problem with the input dictionary file (<a href="/files/hindi.txt">txt</a>, 1.67M) ?).</p>

<p>This troubles me too, and makes me wonder how the dictionaries were compiled. I suspect the Aspell collection might be based on a simple corpus analysis, in which case there is a strong likelihood that it contains transliterated foreign words and, as we can see from your analysis, misspellings and incorrect encodings.</p>

<p>In fact, there were even duplicate entries in the aspell dictionary, so that it is not 7692 but 7819 entries that were added to it by adding entries from the hunspell dictionary. I saved them to a file that I posted on my blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/files/added_20120813.txt">http://typophile.com/files/added_20120813.txt</a></p>
<p>From those 7819 entries, I can see many proper names but I have no idea what is the proportion. That there are errors in the aspell dictionary does not explain  that it would have missed 7819 entries on 15990; that is 48.9%. That means that only 51.1% of hunspell entries, i.e. 8171 entries in hunspell, are also in aspell (which contains over 83000 entries).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many thanks, Uli. I have correlated my most recent draft glyph set to Michel&rsquo;s analysis of the Hunspel and Aspell dictionaries, and am now in the process of correlating to your Sanskrit ligature list and Ernst Tremel&rsquo;s Hindi list. The number of ligature un-attested in these sources is gradually being whittled down, and most that remain are either what I classify as systematic inclusions &ndash; i.e. representative of core aspects of the writing systems qua system such as merged -R forms of each letter &ndash; or are fairly obvious transliteration sequences.</p>
<p>With regard to the latter, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that their inclusion needs to be a matter of individual font and its intended purpose. Coincidentally, Fiona just communicated to me a request from a major Bengali language newspaper publisher to include an SPL conjunct ligature for the transliteration of the English loan word &lsquo;splinter&rsquo;, which apparently occurs often enough in the context of politics to be afforded such treatment. Recently, we worked on user interface fonts for Hindi, and analysed the localised strings for the operating system and other software, finding such unexpected transliterated conjuncts as TZV (barmitzva). Not all of these end up with ligature solutions &ndash; if I can get the half form shaping for rare sequences to look good, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll use &ndash;, but they illustrate the reality of transliterated loan words in modern Hindi.</p>
<p>At present, I am working on a font specifically for pre-modern Hindi texts, so being able to identify the source and attestation for different groups of conjunct ligatures is very helpful.</p>

<p>I wish you good look in finishing your Adobe Devanagari font.</p>
<p>Ligatures are a never-ending story. Look at you own name &ldquo;Hudson&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sanskrit and Hindi do not have &ldquo;ds&rdquo; as a sound combination. This is because the soft dental &ldquo;d&rdquo; would be assimilated to the hard dental &ldquo;t&rdquo; before &ldquo;s&rdquo;, resulting in &ldquo;ts&rdquo;, which would be available as a Hindi ligature. But you would not want your name transliterated in Devanagari as &ldquo;Hutson&rdquo;, would you?</p>
<p>Therefore, transliterating your name in Devanagari would required a new ligature, namely for &ldquo;ds&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One of our Indian associate designers has taken a look at the Hunspell and Aspell Hindi lists, and confirms my suspicion that they are heavily loaded with multiple transliterations or transcriptions of foreign loan words, e.g.</p>
<p>इंग्लिश इंग्लैंड इग्लैंड ग्लव्स 
inglish, ingland, iglaind, and glov(e)s.</p>
<p>This, of course, makes them useful for their purpose of spellchecking for modern Hindi usage, but I&rsquo;m finding Ernst Tremel&rsquo;s list more reliable in terms of being sourced from <em>mostly</em> Hindi words only. I find the presence of conjuncts beginning with ङ that are not attested in either Hunspell or Aspell unnerving, and note even in his list there are transliterations or transcriptions of naturalised terminology e.g. &lsquo;anglo-indiyan&rsquo; or &lsquo;kongres&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of my thinking on this, after taking time to correlate my Devanagari glyph set spreadsheet with the data Michel derived from the Hunspell and Aspell dictionaries and with Ernst Tremel&rsquo;s list of Hindi conjunct ligatures.</p>
<p>I am suspicious of both the Hunspell and Aspell dictionaries as attestation sources for many Hindi conjuncts, simply because they seem to include high numbers of transliterated or transcribed foreign loan words. Tremel&rsquo;s list makes more sense to me, based on his sources, although this too contains some loan words and, importantly in terms of glyph set design, includes large numbers of conjuncts that almost all Hindi writers would instead write with anusvara, e.g. संख्या instead of सङ्ख्या. Also, Tremel&rsquo;s list does not include frequency data.</p>
<p>In terms of the Adobe Devanagari set, there are about 100 conjunct ligatures that are not attested in any of the lists, of which a significant number are of Sanskrit origin, their presence in the Linotype list presumably reflecting those Sanskrit conjuncts that we most frequently encountered in words quoted by Linotype&rsquo;s Indian customers of the time. A few are what I consider &lsquo;systematic inclusions&rsquo;, i.e. those whose existence is implied by the writing system rather than its application to a particular language, e.g. a merged rakar form of the nukta letters. The remainder are presumed to be transliteration and transcription forms for loan words, as requested by Linotype&rsquo;s customers. As noted by Uli, once you start including such forms, it becomes an open ended set, and the only way to constrain it is by frequency. But, of course, the frequency of foreign loan words depends entirely on the nature of the texts examined; which accounts for the differences between the Hunspell, Aspell and Linotype/Adobe sets.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m left with is a set of data that includes a fairly large number of Hunspell and Aspell transliteration conjuncts that are not covered in the Adobe Devanagari set, and vice versa. The most useful aspect of this, at the moment, is that it suggests ways in which I might reduce the draft glyph set of a font I am working on for pre-modern Hindi texts, in which few loan words are expected to be encountered. For fonts targeting modern Hindi usage, the usefulness is less clear, but perhaps there might be candidates among the more common transliteration conjuncts from Hunspell and Aspell that could be added. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m pleased to see just how many of the conjuncts not supported by ligatures in the Adobe Devanagari font shape very well with half forms (which we carefully kerned to that purpose).</p>
<p>Uli, you suggested early in this thread that the Adobe Devanagari set would need only about a dozen more ligatures in order to adequately support classical Sanskrit. This surprised me. The first document to which you linked in this discussion seems to be a subset of Sanskrit conjuncts, certainly much shorter than the complete list in your manual. Can you explain the basis of this subset? Is it based on frequency, or on a particular set of texts?</p>

<p>The first document, namely this document:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/adobe-ligatures.pdf</a></p>
<p>lists attested Sanskrit conjuncts in descending frequency order.</p>
<p>I cut off this partial list at the frequency of 0.010 %, namely here:</p>
<p>ङ्घ्र्य	ṅghry (!!!)  0.010%</p>
<p>If the Adobe Devanagari font contained all attested Sanskrit ligatures down to a frequency of 0.010 %, it would be a very good Sanskrit font, although it would not include the rarest ligatures with a frequency below 0.010%.</p>
<p>These rarest ligatures are only covered by our own highly specialized Itranslator fonts &ldquo;Sanskrit2003.tt&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chandas.ttf&rdquo; and &ldquo;Siddhanda.ttf&rdquo; downloadable here</p>

<p>However, the Adobe Devanagari font, primarily designed for Hindi, could be also a satisfactory Sanskrit font, if it contained a subset of Sanskrit ligatures, provided that at least the most frequent Sanskrit ligatures were covered by the subset.</p>
<p>It is up to you where you cut off the frequency list adobe-ligatures.pdf.</p>
<p>For example, given the present version of the Adobe Devanagari font, it contains all Sanskrit ligatures down to a frequency of 0.215%, because the first ligature not covered by this font is the ligature द्ध्व, namely</p>
<p>द्ध्व	ddhv  (!!!)  0.215%</p>
<p>If you were to include also ड्ग, the Adobe Devanagari font would cover all Sanskrit ligatures down to a frequency of 0.167 %, namely</p>
<p>ड्ग	ḍg     (!!!)  0.167%</p>
<p>and so on and so on. You could proceed and cut off here</p>
<p>द्द्व	ddv  (!!!) 	0.119%, or here:</p>
<p>ङ्घ्र	ṅghr	(!!!) 0.109%, or here:</p>
<p>द्द्र	ddr  (!!!)  0.109%, or here:</p>
<p>ड्य	ḍy	(!!!)  0.097%, or here:</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>ङ्घ्र्य	ṅghry (!!!)	0.010%</p>
<p>If the Adobe Devanagari font included all ligatures down to ङ्घ्र्य, id est down to a frequency of 0.010%, it would be a very good Sanskrit font. But I repeat, you may cut off the list much earlier.</p>
<p>As regards the attestations, I made frequency analyses of original electronic Sanskrit files.</p>
<p>The German University of Göttingen hosts this huge collection of electronic Sanskrit files:</p>
<p><a href="http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.htm">http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.htm</a></p>
<p>Ten years ago, I started with the proofread entire Mahabharata:</p>
<p><a href="http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html">http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html</a></p>
<p>However, it only makes sense to analyze proofread electronic texts:</p>
<p><a href="http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/history.html">http://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/history.html</a></p>
<p>because text files crammed with typos  result in erroneous frequency counts.</p>
<p>For making a good Hindi font, someone would have to analyze proofread electronic Hindi files and would have to make frequency counts. Thereafter it would become clear, which ligatures should be included into a good Hindi font and which should be omitted.</p>
<p>I should like to mention that the German University of Cologne here</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html">http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html</a></p>
<p>hosts a huge electronic Sanskrit dictionary with more than 150,000 entries, which I also completely analysed for my own ligature frequency counts ten years ago.</p>
<p>A similar electronic dictionary should also be available for Hindi. Mr. Boyer&rsquo;s short Hindi word files mentioned above in this thread are not sufficient for large-scale frequency counts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For those who wonder how the statistics based on the dictionaries can be obtained, here is the method I used (using Python regular expressions).</p>
<p>As John said, a compound is a sequence of virama separated consonants. A consonant can be defined by the Python regular expression</p>
<pre>   [\u0915-\u0939\u0958-\u095F]</pre> 
<p>(I just rewrote in Python what John wrote in words above). The Virama is \u094D. A compound is thus a sequence of 1 or more  consonants followed by \u094D (whence the + operator in the code below), with a consonant appended to it. For grouping, I used (?:expression) to avoid the back referencing mechanism.</p>
<p>The dictionary contains one word per line. The following program reads line per line, finds the compounds in each line, and outputs them directly.</p>
<pre>
import re, sys

compound = ur'(?:[\u0915-\u0939\u0958-\u095F]\u094D)+[\u0915-\u0939\u0958-\u095F]'
f=open(sys.argv[1])
word = f.readline().decode('utf-8')
while word:
  for comb in re.findall(compound, word):
    print comb.encode('utf-8')
  word = f.readline().decode('utf-8')
</pre>
<p>If we call this stub <code>compounds.py</code> and if the dictionary is <code>aspell.txt</code>, then</p>
<pre>python compounds.py aspell.txt</pre> 
<p>outputs the compounds (I should rather say the candidates for producing compounds), one per line, as many times as they occur. That should work on any platform.</p>
<p>To get a more sophisticated output, you can make a more involved Python program, or just use standard unix commands if you are on Linux or OS X. The first thing to do is to sort the compounds so that they are grouped together in the output and then use the unix command <code>uniq</code> with the option <code>-c</code> to count them.</p>
<pre>
python compounds.py aspell.txt | sort | uniq -c
</pre>
<p>Here are the first lines of the output:</p>
<blockquote>
 223 क्क
   1 क्क्क
   1 क्क्ड़
  32 क्ख
</blockquote>
So there are 223 occurrences of क्क. It would be interesting now to have those numbers is descending order. Again, all that is needed is to sort those last lines according to the numerical value (option <code>-n</code>) and I'll choose the reverse order (option <code>-r</code>). Here is the full command. 
<pre>
% python compounds.py aspell.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
</pre>
Here are the first lines of the output
<blockquote>
3200 प्र
1614 त्र
1599 क्ष
 961 स्त
 924 र्ण
</blockquote>
Once you know the compounds, you can search for the words containing them in the dictionary using the unix command <code>grep</code>. Very little programming is thus required. 
<p>Of course, to produce a table for LaTeX, the compounds found were put in a Python dictionary and the processing was all done in Python. The full source is 39 lines of Python after removing comments and blank lines (but including the 8 lines above).</p>
<p>Michel
Rem:  I removed duplicates in aspell after I produced my last tex files; the number of occurrences for स्त has decreased from 962  to 961.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed, Maxim. And limiting the name of a typeface to a particular language then limits ones ability to extend the language support of that type in future. Adobe Devanagari is a type that in its current version, as intended, supports modern Hindi usage. I think it highly likely that future versions will support Marathi and Nepali. Whether it will ever support a full range of Sanskrit typography, even Vedic, isn&rsquo;t obvious to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While the concept that there are different conjunct representations appropriate to different languages is sound, I think some of the LaTex choices in this regard are questionable. In the illustration you show, I&rsquo;d say all the &lsquo;Sanskrit&rsquo; ligature forms would be reasonable to use for Hindi and, indeed, are found in plenty of Hindi publishing; there are other Sanskrit ligatures that are not. What LaTeX categorises as &lsquo;Modern Hindi&rsquo; seems to me to represent particular technological limitations of some obsolete typesetting technology that needed to rely on half forms, post forms and explicit halant. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything particularly &lsquo;modern&rsquo; about it; indeed, it now looks to me old fashioned, like the non-kerning f of old Linotype faces.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve taken some time to look a bit more deeply into this issue.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve found is that many Devanagari ligatures are formed by composing a version of a letter without a vertical stroke on the right, and many others are formed by stacking letters vertically.</p>
<p>This suggests that the total number of glyphs required for supporting a large selection of ligatures could be significantly reduced by composing these types of ligatures from their component parts.</p>
<p>(EDIT: I see that this has been thought of, and still many ligatures need to be individually drawn - and that you and a colleague from Russia apparently have produced the only two complete - for classical Sanskrit - Devanagari fonts in existence!)</p>
<p>Another thing I noticed is the sad fate of the project to develop a font for the Sama Veda with what are apparently cantillation marks used for the Sama Gana. My advice would have been to release the preliminary font, and wait for the complaints to roll in - because, psychologically, while teaching you about how the less common marks are used may seem like work when you request it in the abstract, once people have a font in their hands that they would like to use, telling you how to fix it so they can use it better seems to them as though they&rsquo;re getting you to do the work.</p>
<p>On USENET, if you ask a question, you may not get an answer. But if someone does give you the wrong answer, lots of people will chime in to correct him!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, some conjuncts can be created from sequences of so-called half forms, and the OpenType Layout model for Devanagari enables this. [Unicode also provides a control character mechanism to force half forms if supported by the font; this can be used to override vertical conjuncts with horizontal layout.] If the sequences of half form(s) and full form are carefully kerned in the font, the result can be really quite acceptable. Quite a lot of rare conjuncts are displayed in this way with the Adobe Devanagari fonts, and one can&rsquo;t easily tell from the resulting typeform that one is looking at a half form sequence instead of a ligature (until, that is, one enters an ikar after them, because the variant width ikar selection currently only works with ligatures).</p>
<p>Now, all that said, in some conjuncts, especially wide ones, a subtle reduction in the width of the component letters is desirable, and then in some cases modification of stroke weights to maintain an even colour on the page. Or some form of optical  correction of overlapping segments might be desirable. So half form sequences are not always the way to go.</p>
<p>[As noted in this <a href="http://typophile.com/node/95785#comment-520041">other thread</a>, the Linotype hot metal composing method formed many individual letters from combinations of half form and long a vowel sign.]</p>

<p>It is possible to make a highly professional Devanagari font consisting mainly of half-forms. The Rigveda edition by Prof. R. L. Kashyap and Prof. S. Sadagopan published in printed book form in 1998 and also downloadable at my website as PDF files was typeset using such a two-halves font. See here</p>

<p>Yes, and usually require careful kerning too. We&rsquo;ve made use of contextual variant half and post (conjunct-final) forms in some fonts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of rationalising the glyph set for a new Hindi font, and am removing a good number of the transliteration ligatures that we included in Adobe Devanagari (most of which can be shaped with half forms anyway) and adding some more vertical ligatures to cover Sanskrit quoted words without explicit halant.</p>

<p><em>Arabic was shown with more than four forms of each letter</em></p>
<p>As is entirely normal. To my knowledge, there is not a single Arabic or Persian work on Arabic writing that uses the &lsquo;four-forms-per-letter&rsquo; analysis. It is a European misconception, most likely introduced by Biblical scholars whose prior knowledge was of Syriac (for which the analysis makes sense). Arabic and Persian scribes would never have made that error, because they would be aware that there was no attested style of Arabic writing for which the four-form analysis is true, not even the most geometric &lsquo;kufi&rsquo;. Unfortunately, it is an error that persists in almost all introductory grammars of Arabic in English, and forms the basis OpenType Arabic shaping model, which requires letters to be mapped to initial, medial and final forms before one can apply the actual joining rules of the script or of particular styles.</p>

<p>Just when I think I am getting a handle on the data, I come across another conjunct list that completely contradicts the others. Uli, I am hoping that you are familiar with a &lsquo;Saṃyoga Table&rsquo; document that lists Sanskrit conjuncts as found in four sources:</p>
<p>Coulson, Michael. <em>Teach yourself Sanskrit.</em>
Monier-Williams. <em>A practical grammar of the Sanskrit Language.</em>
Vasu, S.C. <em>Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini.</em>
Agenbroad, J.E. &lsquo;Difficult characters: a collection of Devanagari conjunct consonants&rsquo; (in Bulletin 38 of the International Association of Orientalist Librarians).</p>
<p>I have this document as a PDF, but have been unable to find it online again this evening (the contents are images, not live text, so it is impossible to search for effectively). If you do not have it, I would be happy to send it to you, but I am guessing that you know it.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, I have been collating my draft Hindi glyph set specification with Ernst Tremel&rsquo;s list, with your higher frequency Sanskrit list, and with the Hunspell and Aspell frequency analysis that Michel did (the latter mostly useful in that it includes sample words that make it easy to determine whether a conjunct is found only in loan words). I have been performing a kind of triage, identifying conjuncts that could be removed from my glyph set spec. I thought I had identified 63 conjuncts that could be safely removed from a font that didn&rsquo;t aim to support modern loan words, e.g. a font for pre-modern literary Hindi, which is what I happen to be working on at the moment. I was happy with this number, but Fiona spotted one conjunct in this group that she recalled seeing in Sanskrit, so I decided to double check against your Sanskrit ligature list in the Itrans manual, and also against the Saṃyoga Table document. I was dismayed to find that 52 of these conjuncts appear in the Saṃyoga Table but not in your Itrans list. These are (with my glyph names, not standard romanisation; sources as indicated in the Saṃyoga Table):</p>

<p>I understand and appreciate the method you used to arrive at your ligature list, which is why I&rsquo;m inclined to consider it reliable. But I am worried by so many conjuncts occurring in the Saṃyoga Table that are not in your list (and I am only showing here the intersection of the Table with those glyphs that I am considering removing from my spec; I believe there are additional conjuncts in the Table that are not in your list or in my spec).</p>
<p>I wonder if you might be able to share any insight on these discrepancies? In the meantime, I will write to James Agenbroad, whom I know from Unicode circles, and will try to get a copy of the journal with his original collection.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Hudson:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;ब्न | dBNa | Coulson&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The Agenbroad collection is &ldquo;old hat&rdquo; to me.</p>
<p>In my comprehensive book <strong>&ldquo;Conjuncts Consonants in Sanskrit&rdquo;</strong>, which is an unpublished work according to German Copyright Law and according to the Revised Berne Convention and which I cannot yet make available to others prior to publication, I wrote this on the invented ligature &ldquo;bn&rdquo;:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Charles Wilkins (1808), Alix Desgranges (1845), M.R. Kale (1894), Richard Fick (1922), A.A. MacDonell (1926), H.M. Lambert (1953), Michael Coulson (1973) and Madhav M. Deshpande (1997) invented the conjunct consonant &ldquo;bn&rdquo;. If &ldquo;bn&rdquo; were no invention, then a Sanskrit word would exist containing &ldquo;bn&rdquo;. But there does not exist any such Sanskrit word. Therefore &ldquo;bn&rdquo; has been invented. Yet &ldquo;bn&rdquo; could occur in a foreign-language word, e.g. in &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo;, inserted into Neo-Sanskrit texts. But serious scientific research on Sanskrit conjunct consonants must dismiss such &ldquo;abnormalities&rdquo;.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>If you search for &ldquo;bn&rdquo; in the huge Sanskrit dictionary file</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf</a></p>
<p>you will not find any Sanskrit words containing &ldquo;bn&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Sanskrit words with &ldquo;bn&rdquo; are non-existant, it does not make much sense to design the ligature &ldquo;bn&rdquo; for a Sanskrit font, because this ligature will never be used on account of the fact that Sanskrit words with &ldquo;bn&rdquo; do not exist.</p>
<p>More than 300 of the approx. 1000 conjunct consonants, i.e. roughly 30% of the collection by Agenbroad, are entirely fictitious, <strong>as far as Sanskrit is concerned</strong>.</p>
<p>Some of these 300 ligatures compiled by Mr. Agenbroad may occur in foreign-language loan words in Hindi and Marathi texts, but they definitely do not occur in ancient Sanskrit texts. That is for sure.</p>
<p>In the funny book &ldquo;Spoken Sanskrit&rdquo; edited by S. S. Janaki and published by the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute in 1990, you will find a fictitious Sanskrit report on a tennis match at Wimbledon between Björn Borg and John McEnroe.</p>
<p>For typesetting the name &ldquo;Wimbledon&rdquo; in Devanagari, you could invent the ligature &ldquo;mbl&rdquo;, and in fact, this invented ligature is contained in the Agenbroad collection and also contained in the book by Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro, Lingua Sanscrita, Romae 1936. But this does not mean that this entirely fictitious ligature &ldquo;mbl&rdquo; will ever be required for typesetting an ancient Sanskrit text, since there never existed a Sanskrit word containing &ldquo;mbl&rdquo;. This is a fact which you can check yourself here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf">www.sanskritweb.net/sansdocs/reverse1.pdf</a></p>
<p>or here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html">www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html</a></p>
<p>Do <strong>substring</strong> search for &ldquo;bn&rdquo; and &ldquo;mbl&rdquo; on Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon (166,434 entries). You will get no hits at all for these entirely fictitious ligatures.</p>
<p>So, why should you care to design fictitious ligatures for fictitious Sanskrit words?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for the detailed response, Uli. I had assumed that at least some of the Samyoga Table entries were &lsquo;fictitious&rsquo;, to use your term, either the result of loan words in Devanagari contexts that were not limited to Sanskrit, or of misreadings of manuscripts or poorly proofread texts. But you can perhaps appreciate my concern, as a non-Sanskritist, to find so many questionable entries. Thankfully, on my current project I have a number of Sanskritists to whom I will eventually be able to submit my Sanskrit glyph set for review. And I do plan to double-check against the Cologne Lexicon; thank you for this suggestion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Searching in the Cologne lexicon seems odd in that the dictionary uses the Harvard-Kyoto romanisation system, which relies on case sensitivity and digraphs, but the search results are case-insensitive and can&rsquo;t distinguish digraph occurrences from individual letters. Hence, if I do a substring search for &lsquo;ksT&rsquo; I get the same results as for &lsquo;kst&rsquo; and for &lsquo;kSt&rsquo; and &lsquo;kST&rsquo;, and these include instances of &lsquo;th&rsquo; as well as &rsquo;t'.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Uli. I did searches in the Cologne lexicon and visually reviewed the results, and also used the <a href="http://www.sanskrita.org/wiki/index.php/Converter">Sanskrita converter</a> to check results in Devangari.</p>
<p>Specifically, I did substring searches for conjuncts that are in my current draft glyph set and also in the Samyoga list but <em>not</em> in your frequency list. Most of these, as you would predict, do not occur in the Cologne lexicon. A few do, though, although most are very rare:</p>

9 द्ब्र dbr as in सद्ब्रह्मन् sadbrahman (n. the true Brahman ib.) &mdash; attested conjunct, frequency 0.277%, i.e. very frequent and included in my frequency list
1 न्त्स nts in अनश्नन्त्साङ्गमन anaznantsAGgamana (m. the sacrificial fire in the Sabha1 &hellip; S3Br.) &mdash; an-aznan-t-sAGgamana is formed by n+&ldquo;t&rdquo;+s and is contained in my frequency list as a peculiar Vedic sandhi in the Shatapatha-Brahmana. In other Sanskrit texts, n+s is used instead of n+&ldquo;t&rdquo;+s, i.e. &ldquo;t&rdquo; is not inserted.

<p>I am under the impression that you changed your mind and that you now intend to include into the Adobe Devanagari font even the most exotic conjuncts. Nobody would search for &ldquo;ls&rdquo;, because this combination is impossible in Sanskrit. And as regards &ldquo;nts&rdquo;, it is an odd peculiarity in some Brahmana manuscripts and hence should only be included into the most specialized Sanskrit fonts.</p>

<cite>The number of scanning errors in the Cologne lexicon is alarming.</cite></p>
<p>But hardly unexpected. Most OCR software is oriented around the Latin alphabet, as it lends itself better to that process, and the humans available to check the results would presumably have been native speakers of German (or possibly French, Köln not being too far from the border, as its English name attests) rather than Hindi, let alone Sanskrit.</p>
<p>We have to count ourselves lucky that a thing like the Cologne lexicon even <em>exists</em>, even though its imperfections certainly do need to be remedied.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Hudson:</p>
<p>Having stated above on 4 Sep 2012:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Charles Wilkins (1808), Alix Desgranges (1845), M.R. Kale (1894), Richard Fick (1922), A.A. MacDonell (1926), H.M. Lambert (1953), Michael Coulson (1973) and Madhav M. Deshpande (1997) invented the conjunct consonant &ldquo;bn&rdquo;. If &ldquo;bn&rdquo; were no invention, then a Sanskrit word would exist containing &ldquo;bn&rdquo;. But there does not exist any such Sanskrit word. Therefore &ldquo;bn&rdquo; has been invented. Yet &ldquo;bn&rdquo; could occur in a foreign-language word, e.g. in &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo;, inserted into Neo-Sanskrit texts. But serious scientific research on Sanskrit conjunct consonants must dismiss such &ldquo;abnormalities&rdquo;.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>it seems to me that you and Mrs. Fiona are trying to find an attestation for the ligature &ldquo;bn&rdquo; in Sanskrit in order to prove that I am wrong.</p>
<p>I should like to mention that you are not the first ones who tried to do that.</p>
<p>However, it seems to me that Mrs. Fiona did not learn Sanskrit, otherwise she would not have said that</p>
<p>अब्नाभः =&ldquo;abnābhaḥ&rdquo;</p>
<p>was given in the Monier-Williams dictionary. The usage of this dictionary is tricky and error-prone for non-Sanskritists. On page 60, middle column, the main entry starts with &ldquo;ab-ja&rdquo; which is a compound in itself composed of &ldquo;ab&rdquo; (from &ldquo;ap&rdquo;) + &ldquo;ja&rdquo;. A few lines below, you see &ldquo;-nābha&rdquo; (and also &ldquo;-netra&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The compound here must be build as &ldquo;abja-nābha&rdquo;, and not as &ldquo;ab-nābha&rdquo;, as was thought by Mrs. Fiona. But the correct compound &ldquo;abja-nābha&rdquo; does not contain the ligature &ldquo;bn&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Theoretically or &ldquo;exempli gratia&rdquo; or &ldquo;just for fun&rdquo;, it would be possible to construct a Sanskrit compound word  containing the ligature &ldquo;bn&rdquo;, for example the compound</p>
<p>अब्निर्वाण (= abnirvāṇa = &ldquo;the nirvana in the water&rdquo;)</p>
<p>invented by me here exempli gratia. But you will never find any attestation for this compound.</p>
<p>I do not deny that it is theoretically possible to find the combination &ldquo;bn&rdquo; in any old Sanskrit text, but none was found so far.</p>
<p>The statistics mathematician and font lover Luc  Devroye would say that from the probability point of view, the mathematical likelihood that a Sanskritist will ever need the ligature &ldquo;bn&rdquo; in a font for typesetting a real Sanskrit word is converging to &ldquo;zero&rdquo;, &ldquo;nil&rdquo; or &ldquo;nought&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For example, by analyzing Panini&rsquo;s grammar, I found exactly 114 additional artificial ligatures pertaining to Panini&rsquo;s acronym-like grammatical elements. But I included none of these artificial acronym ligatures into my official ligature list here</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf</a> (page 29 seq.)</p>
<p>because none of these artificial acronym-like ligatures could be found in any ordinary Sanskrit text.</p>
<p>Additional note for scholars: &ldquo;abja-nābha&rdquo; occurs in the Bhagavata-Purana repeatedly. Hence it is an attested compound word.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Uli, I am certainly <em>not</em> setting out to prove that you are wrong. And neither I nor Fiona singled out the bn conjunct ligature for attention. I am whittling away at a list of dubious conjuncts and this one happened to be unique in that we found it used in Lambert&rsquo;s book and apparently in Monier-Williams, and I posted a message about it here not to prove you wrong but because I wanted your opinion on it. Why? Because I value your opinion on matters Sanskrit, and you can usually explain oddities in a reasonable and convincing manner. In other words, I asked because I consider you likely to be <em>right,</em> not wrong.</div>

<p>A postgraduate diploma in Sanskrit and a PhD in Indian palaeography, both from SOAS.</p>
<p>One of the things I have noticed is that grammars of the <em>writing</em> of Sanskrit, from Panini onwards, have a tendency to fill out, to variable degrees, the possibilities of the writing system independent of its application to the actual language. Hence, as Uli notes, one can find many listings of conjuncts that are not attested in actual texts. Some of these &lsquo;systematic inclusions&rsquo; may end up being used in foreign loanwords, or in the orthographies of other languages adopting the script, but will never occur in Sanskrit. This is why Uli&rsquo;s work analysing frequency in proofread Sanskrit texts is so useful.</p>

<p>In this way, the high degree of order and rationality of the Sanskrit grammar and <em>sandhi</em> strikes me as akin to the Periodic Table of the elements in that it seems to hypothesize and predict specific possibilities that do not however exist naturally — only in the laboratory environment and for short durations. ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have stepped over this discussion on Adobe Devanagari only recently and would like to add a few comments. But first let me say, while I admit that there is place for improvement, Adobe Devanagari was exactly what I needed and came right in time for a bilingual edition of Hindi short stories accompanied by German translations I am working at.</p>
<p>(1) Most of the joint letters (ligatures) Uli took offense at are in actual use in Hindi, Marathi and Nepali. Both in novels and newspapers it is quite common to transliterate words and even complete sentences from English into Devanagari. It took me only a few seconds to think for possible candidates: 
क्स्प्र kspr: express (extremely common, there are hundreds of trains with that name, no &ldquo;ink-spray&rdquo; necessary)
क्स्प्ल kspl: explain
also things like न्फ़्र nfr: conference (which happily have been included)
Please, Adobe, don’t remove these ligatures whatever Sanskritists may think about them, there is much practical publishing experience behind most of the list.
ब्न is common in Nepali (e.g. डुब्नु drown)</p>
<p>(2) Adobe Devanagari goes a long way even in Sanskrit and Vedic. Modern editions don’t have all the traditional ligatures used in manuscripts as they tend to turn out clumsy in print. 
It would be fine some time to have Samavedic accents too (so far only Rigvedic accents are available). 
Accent combinations for transliteration of Vedic (ā́ ā̀ etc) are also missing.
But then, even Rome wasn’t built in one day.</p>
<p>(3) Language codes and stylistic sets should be enabled for much more alternatives than they are now. InDesign CS6 has a language tag for Hindi, but not for Sanskrit (on the internet, you can find a clumsy way to get it, but I did not try).</p>
<p>(4) For the time being, while the font claims to be primarily made for modern Hindi, the ligatures you get by default (letter + halant + letter) are quite often the traditional rather than the modern forms, the latter preferring half letters. To get theses, you have to type an additional non width joinder. Compare:
क + क : क्क (old style)     क्‍क (modern)   visible only in Adobe Devanagari
न + न : न्न  (old style)     न्‍न (modern)    visible only in Adobe Devanagari
श + व : श्व  (old style)     श्‍व (modern)
It would be a good idea to handle this issue by different stylistic sets and/or language tags.
I would appreciate to have Sanskrit, Hindi (traditional ligatures), Hindi (modern ligatures), Marathi &amp; Nepali (for the latter two languages, automatical creation of e.g. र्‍य ry and the like where needed would be very helpful)</p>
<p>I don’t think that John’s commentary on this point is correct. The modern half forms are really ‘modern’ (in Hindi!), not just a compromise with dated technology: they are used in contemporary print because they are more legible than the traditional manuscript ligatures and therefore even recommended for e.g. text books. The comparison with the old Linotype-f is misleading; rather one should consider the whole paraphernalia of Greek ligatures used in Byzantine manuscripts which hardly any font for classical Greek does include as they are no longer used in print, again for the simple reason of legibility (Claude Garamond did use them, and there are two or three fonts around that have a lot of them – but in a stylistic set you have to turn on if you want to have them!)</p>
<p>(5) The short i-matra extends by default over the complete consonant combination it precedes:
कि but क्ष्मि  (only visible in Adobe Devanagari). This seems sometimes a bit to much, so it would be fine if there were an option to turn the feature off or reduce the it to a more moderate size – say by an option like swash letters or titling caps (But then, Adobe can be adamant, as with the Th-ligature in all of Slimbach’s fonts).</p>
<p>ps.: I hope the Devanagari samples are readable, as I don’t have the time to prepare and include graphics. If not, copy the text and paste it into a Unicode-savvy Word processor and formate the whole section with Adobe Devanagari, Devanagari MT, Kokila or any other new Devanagari font.</p>

<p>@Michel Boyer 
For a Hindi corpora <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/">http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/</a> might do, but that&rsquo;s not pure Hindi. But for a pre-modern font as per John Hudson it might do. Great you&rsquo;re &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; with the LaTeX font package, because nobody else seem to be in the discussion deep enough.
I must say I&rsquo;m impressed with your .pdfs.
A small specimen I put together:
[[http://samskrtam.ru/adobe-devanagari-font/|Adobe Devanagari for a Sanskrit Dhatupatha]].
I compiled a list of Sanskrit 1379 ligatures based on 15 Sanskrit grammars after reading <a href="http://typophile.com/node/95460">http://typophile.com/node/95460</a>. Graphical variants which are introduced by the authors quoted are treated as separate ligatures, up to 79. As many as 991 are unique to only 1 source (a minimum). 8 are met in 14 out of 15 sources (a maximum). The list is even bigger than Mr. Boyer&rsquo;s Samyoga Table. But it&rsquo;s not about size. Because errors and ligatures go together a long way.
1	991
2	92
3	41

We owe much to Ulrich. His work is known and used wider even than Ernst Tremel&rsquo;s. I would love to see a version of his &ldquo;entirely fictitious ligature&rdquo; list for Sanskrit. Nothing remained the same
<cite>Rigveda edition by Prof. R. L. Kashyap and Prof. S. Sadagopan published in printed book form in 1998</cite> 
after he started his research on devanagari typography, of which a culmination was his replica of Bombay&rsquo;s Nirnayasagar&rsquo;s bold type called [[http://www.omniglot.com/blog/?p=621|Sanskrit 2003]]. One would love to see a &ldquo;Sanskrit 2013&rdquo; (ten years after) with OpenType variants included for ligatures and vowels.</p>
<p>Even though I have personal reasons for not loving Ulrich Stiehl, I must admit that he knows more about the technical part of a Sanskrit font than any German knows. I could say that more than any European, but there is Mihas Bayaryn, so you can&rsquo;t be #1 until Mihas is alive. And seems he is here to stay. A pitty all <a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/">http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/</a> URLs have died.</p>
<p><cite>These rarest ligatures are only covered by our own highly specialized Itranslator fonts &ldquo;Sanskrit2003.tt&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chandas.ttf&rdquo; and &ldquo;Siddhanda.ttf&rdquo; downloadable here
<a href="http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/">http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/</a></cite></p>
<p>Siddhanda.ttf is and I hope never will downloadable at Ulrich&rsquo;s website. Chandas.ttf indeed is, 
but as per Mihas (author of the font), he treats Chandas as a draft for Siddhanta.</p>
<p><cite>by analyzing Panini&rsquo;s grammar, I found exactly 114 additional artificial ligatures pertaining to Panini&rsquo;s acronym-like grammatical elements</cite>
As said it would be interesting to see the context and the ligatures, so one could check how they where printed in the 1887 edition printed at Drugulin. I have a list of Drugulin&rsquo;s devanagari from an archive with 425 elements, including ligatures (one would have to add - only). Still no better Sanskrit typography was ever printed that the one of Drugulin.</p>
<p>Same as Ulrich I deal with Sanskrit on a daily basis. And as Indians do not make Sanskrit fonts, Germans and Russians have to do so. It might sound strange, but even the original Nirnaya is based on a Berlin-made font from Uengern brothers. Schlegel was a German if I&rsquo;m not wrong. Frutiger was an Indian only a bit - so there is not much of Indian in the history of Indian fonts. [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/uyvF2nK92J0|Indians are above fonts]]. They care about the text, to preserve the manuscripts. Errors? Typoes? Who cares. Virama-ligatures in a Sanskrit conference thesis? So be it. &ldquo;We&rdquo; are above it. Oh, really?!</p>
<p>After we had years to fight with &ldquo;Mangal&rdquo;, which was a makeshift font including only the &ldquo;commonest conjuncts&rdquo; (using Ulrich&rsquo;s expression), I understand why Ulrich does not feels comfortable with the Adobe Devanagari (John Hudson&rsquo;s) policy. I understand that Adobe&rsquo;s policy is above Mr. Hudson&rsquo;s. But not having Marathi or Nepali in the next edition would not have any excuses, I guess. Sanskrit is Huge. Marathi is just a feature compared to the complexity of Sanskrit ligatures.</p>
<p>@John Hudson 
Would it ever be possible to make at least a few screencasts of your work with VOLT showing the font process working with devanagari? There is next to nothing documented and a video would be something appreciated indeed.
<cite> Can you explain the basis of this subset? Is it based on frequency, or on a particular set of texts?</cite> 
When Ulrich asked you, he meant, that nothing of it is used. It&rsquo;s strange indeed. If you take something for granted (a list not of your own), you have to have samples in what words do they occur. For example, one can not  make a universal Sanskrit font, every font will work only with a limited (small or huge) amount of texts. At GRETIL, with which most of the Sanskritists are working nowadays, there are around 600 texts. 
But Ulrich&rsquo;s list is not a list of ligatures in all GRETIL&rsquo;s 600 texts (as he states in different wording himself). He has dropped out the grammatical literature with it&rsquo;s anubandhas. So you can not print an Indian grammar or might experience issues - because grammar is not a text he would want to include. Mihas' font Siddhanta is the first one to include the grammarians only ligatures as well, because Mihas himself is rooted deep in the Paninian system. I&rsquo;m working on a Dhatupatha Concordance and must say, that from the technological point of view no devanagari font comes even close. I&rsquo;m not a fan of it&rsquo;s thin as hair stylistics, I&rsquo;m used to the bold types.</p>
<p><cite> Coulson, Michael. Teach yourself Sanskrit.

Vasu, S.C. Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini.
Agenbroad, J.E. &lsquo;Difficult characters: a collection of Devanagari conjunct consonants&rsquo; (in Bulletin 38 of the International Association of Orientalist Librarians).</cite> 
Coulson&rsquo;s list a very small one. It has 1 variant for every ligature, which means it is a poorly made list. Why on earth one would want to take it in consideration at all? Monier-Williams has around 170 000 Sanskrit words (even if put together with other Sanskrit dictionaries it would be around 200 000 so a relatively small number). Vasu&rsquo;s Aṣṭādhyāyī is the most authoritative edition of Pāṇini. But are the anubandhas from Dhatupatha included? Never seen Agenbroad&rsquo;s list, so can&rsquo;t comment on it. Is there a scan of it available somewhere, gentlemen? Mr. Hudson, when you wrote &ldquo;get a copy of the journal with his original collection&rdquo; - did you have any luck with it?</p>
<p>@quadibloc 
It does not matter that &ldquo;OCR software is oriented around the Latin alphabet&rdquo;. The Cologne project had Indians working (not Frenchmen) on the proofreading but there are thousands of errors left. I&rsquo;ve been submitting my five cents every few months, but it would take around 50 years to fix all of them at such a rate. And there are several editions of the OCR texts from Cologne - not always newer is better, new errors arive as well (because of converting to the new markup as well). Anyway - nobody else has done even 1/10 of they&rsquo;ve done so you can&rsquo;t say a single bad word about them. One heels only gratitude and can&rsquo;t say enough &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;
After all those OCRs where done <a href="http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php">http://www.indsenz.com/int/index.php</a> was released. It was unreliable in the beginning. But as of 2013 it has a very small error rate and is the best OCR software for devanagari. ABBYY Fine Reader (a trained one) does not comes even close. No other (inlcuding Indian coders) comes close. I&rsquo;ve explored the OCR market, I know what I speak about.</p>
<p>@Rainer 
(1) agreed. 
(2) Samavedic accents from Adobe - you made my day. They can&rsquo;t make a feature for a single text if they have no features for hundreds of other (more popular) texts. That would not make much logic. Rome wasn’t built in one day - but the building of a devanagari at Adobe is only in the plans, as regarding Sanskrit. I must say I&rsquo;m impressed by the look and feel of the font except the details as screenshoted <a href="http://samskrtam.ru/adobe-devanagari-font/">http://samskrtam.ru/adobe-devanagari-font/</a>
(3)  &ldquo;language tag for Hindi, but not for Sanskrit&rdquo; - indeed.
(4) &ldquo;font claims to be primarily made for modern Hindi, the ligatures you get by default (letter + halant + letter) are quite often the traditional rather than the modern forms&rdquo; - so if it&rsquo;s Hindi, be it Hindi by default. Kill every Sanskritism and we&rsquo;ll accept that we should not even try to print a Sanskrit text. If it&rsquo;s in between - that&rsquo;s worse.
(5) As per short i-matra that &ldquo;extends by default over the complete consonant combination it precedes&rdquo; - I fully agree. There must be a way to turn it off. Sometimes it can become too long. Adobe&rsquo;s Devanagari is not the first one to have it, but when it&rsquo;s too long is looks ugly in every print, be it old or new.
(6) As per &ldquo;modern half forms are really ‘modern’ (in Hindi!), not just a compromise with dated technology&rdquo; - that&rsquo;s an interesting and new insight.</p>
<p>If one only could add screenshots and include attachments I could show the Ligature Concordance here.</p>
