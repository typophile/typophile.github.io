        the letters are actually more like placeholders if you like. The main problem
        is getting the letters to fit together in a way that looks natural, so on
        the W for example, the left and right strokes are the most important elements
        to get working, the 'Innards' of the letter are open to being redrawn at a
        later date in order to match the rest of the letters. All these letters were
        drawn in Illustrator using a tablet. Not the ideal way to draw them but the
        fastest way to put together a 'skeleton' character set that can be quickly
        duplicated and tested against other letter forms.\r\n\r\nI don't think a typeface
        like this, if it were ever put into production, could ever be described as
        being produced \"for gain and/or profit\". The amount of work involved in
        doing this properly and the amount of income it would make me would most likely
        make this a 'not-for-profit-enterprise' if you get my drift. I'd say the chances
        of me becoming hugely rich from doing this are slim to say the least, in fact
        it would be much more likely to leave me eating toast based meals for the
        rest of my life. For your average ad agency looking to tack on a bit of street
        cred to a youth brand, currently stuck with the option of paying a willing
        artist to get involved or using one of those nasty free graffiti fonts, it
        would give them another option: spend $39.00 USD for instant cool. This is
        where the danger lies, as this is where its open to being abused by McStarCola\u2122
        and Co. and their agencies. The truth is though that graffiti as an artform
        is regularly r-ped for profit by large companies. I admit I'm not keen on
        being an accomplice to that, but there are some pretty acceptable graffiti
        fonts out there these days, at least to joe average.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.graffitifonts.net/fonts.htm\r\nhttp://www.handselecta.com/fonts.html\r\n\r\nI
        think we can safely give up on ever producing a graffiti font that writers
        will like.\r\n\r\nRegardless of these issues, its the challenge of formalising
        a handstyle that interests me, as to me, it seems a lot trickier than formalising
        any other style of handwriting styles. Graffiti fonts have come on a lot in
        the last few years, but as you know there are many different handstyles out
        there, so theres room for a few more and still room for improvement."

      the letter 'jigsaw' to work is initially more important than the individual
      letters. The whole typeface is more important than any individual glyph, so
      any letter that doesn't 'lock' properly with the other letters needs to be redrawn.
      This overlapping of characters is something fundamental to making a handstyle
      typeface work, something that makes graffiti type different to any other handwriting
      lettering styles (I think? Any examples welcome!). Drawing final characters
      without solving this problem would be a waste of time.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"As a practitioner,

      graffiti type is stuck. Those designed by credible writers aren't necessarily
      good typefaces (http://www.handselecta.com/fonts.html) and for me sit in the
      same category as some of the FUSE releases (cool, inspiring, experimental but
      not very useful). So far we have graff fonts that are as good at emulating graffiti
      as Tekton is at emulating handwriting. It will take someone with a background
      in typography to finally crack it, rather than simply compiling a set of letters
      from Seen, T-Kid or any other credible writer. Any real breakthroughs aren't
      likely to come from anyone credible artists, because initially it's more about
      problem solving than style."

    think that Muffin was pointing out how this person hasn't reached the level of
    contributing to the graff scene. There are many \"graff writers\" but rarely do
    you find \"good style writers.\" Picking up a marker is one thing, mastering it
    is a whole other thing. I think it is those who have achieved graff-greatness
    that deserve a font. All too often, I see <em>bad</em> graff wanna be lettering
    on designs from clothes to coporate campaigns that try to be \"hip\" or \"urban\"
    watering down the public perseption and taking jobs away from the people who should
    be doing this type of design. Then we have companies like Scion who are using
    the pros to do graff inspired designs.\r\n\r\nStyle writers and long term practitioners
    risk alot to put their letters on the walls, including arrest and confrentation
    with peers...not to mention the harsh critiques from fellow writers. \r\n\r\nThere
    is a certain feel to \"Field tested\" graff styles that cannot be emulated by
    non-style writers. \r\n\r\nLooking at these glyphs again, I can see a few things
    I wouldnt personally do \"on the job.\" This is coming from a US West coast perspective
    and may differ in the mecca:\r\n\r\n\u2022handstyles are rendered very quickly.
    With this in mind, I would not lift the pen when doing a letter. This limitation
    causes certain commonalities to the overall letterforms. Some of these in the
    above alphabet have wabbly lines that are shunned upon over here (shows you were
    scared when you wrote your name). and there are like 3 strokes in the \"K\" not
    to mention other letters.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The dot on the \"i\" is just not cool,
    3rd sample is a little better\r\n\r\n\u2022 The mini serif does not really go
    with this. Nor does the larger one in the 3rd sample\r\n\r\n\u2022The \"T, G,
    B, R and U\" really need some help.\r\n\r\n\u2022The color of this alphabet does
    not work. Although graff does not have formal training, letter color is a sign
    of a solid handstyle.\r\n\r\n\u2022OT will not help this. The font should be solid
    without help, and OT should assist in adding variety in its display usage.\r\n\r\n...a
    tad bit of an anal critique, but its difficult to describe it without. Nothing

    with graffiti styles and a real connection to graffiti and its graphic potential.
    \r\n\r\nI tend to think no graffiti font will look any good without OpenType.
    I think of graffiti as a form of performance calligraphy, done quickly. It's all
    about gesture. Type takes all the gesture out of letterforms by making them tame,
    so they can all work in any combination.  In graffiti, there are so many endings,
    dots, finishing marks, swashes, etc. It's almost like Arabic in its complexity.
    I think someone really tuned to graff styles should develop the substitution rules
    and ligature options for a graffiti font.\r\n\r\nAnd then that graffiti artist

    too much hero-worship is bad for any subculture that is about coming up from nowhere
    and making a name for yourself.  However I do get what you mean about the innovators
    and originators deserving credit more than anyone else. Personally I'm more interested
    in the regional variations in letter styles that evolved pre-internet, and they
    were rarely (never?) invented by a single writer. Anyhow, we are confusing real-world
    graffiti credibility with producing a typeface here, the two are different.\r\n\r\nWhy
    do I think that top league writers won't be the ones to create a useful graffiti-style
    typeface? Well for a start, graffiti is not calligraphy. Graffiti is about freeforming
    using a set of letters. It prides itself on variation, funk, flow and flair, whereas
    calligraphy is generally much more restrained and repetitive, making it much easier
    to formalise into type. I would be pretty surprised if a top league graffiti writer
    can really crack the graffiti-type thing as generally they aren't as restrained
    or disciplined as calligraphers.\r\n\r\nFood for thought (just to confuse things):\r\n\r\nP22's
    typeface based on C\xE9zannes handwriting (for example) is interesting as a comparison.
    We all realise that P22 aren't in the same league as Paul C\xE9zanne as artists,
    but likewise C\xE9zanne himself couldn't do what P22 have done, even though he
    is the undisputed master of his own handwriting style! in 2008 Honda decides to
    use this typeface to sell their cars to arty types. C\xE9zanne fans around the
    world gasp in horror, but the use of the typeface doesn't detract from the brilliance
    of his art.\r\n\r\nPS: I personally wouldn't suggest creating a font based on
    a single writers style, but I hope you get my point."

    comment about scanning your own lettering is one of the most valid I think. I've
    been almost obsessed by creating a graffiti typeface for a while now (and I'm
    currently trying).\r\n\r\nThe main problem is the fact that by nature, a tag is
    dynamic, each letter creating tension with those around it. The flow of the tag
    also relies heavily on the way it interacts with it's substrate/surroundings.\r\n\r\nFor
    these reasons, creating a genuine authentic tag style \"typeface\" is nigh on
    impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd unless the typographer who chooses you use the face is
    willing to do some serious kerning and baseline shifting, the end result will
    always look contrived, naive and just plain wack.\r\n\r\nThis is all coming from
    a graffiti writer's point of view.\r\n\r\nAnyway! Having said all that, here are
    some of the letters I\u2019ve been drawing. As you will see they are stylized
    and irregular in shape, so would never really work as a traditional typeface.

  body: "Hello everyone!\r\n\r\nLots of interesting opinions & comments here. It's
    hard to agree or disagree with any of them entirely. I have been a graffiti artist
    since about 1991. That's about 24 years at this point. I also happen to be the
    founder of the (I must say) ORIGINAL & official Graffiti Fonts\xAE type foundry
    which started somewhat unofficially in 1999 and was in full active commerce, enjoying
    trademark & copyright protection by about 2003-2004. I have personally created
    more graffiti style typefaces than the rest of the collective world. I have spent
    most of my adult life & most of my money to develop & protect the relative purity
    of graffiti art as it makes it's debut into the world of type. \r\n\r\nGraffiti
    lettering defies typographic concepts & mechanics by it's very nature, no matter
    the advanced capabilities of opentype or the prowess of the font developer.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I first set upon this mission there was literally no such thing as a graffiti
    style font. It is debatable wether or not I was the first to create one. In any
    case I am personally acquainted with the few other people who unleashed the other
    \"first\" graffiti style fonts & its a close call and is a VERY small pool to
    swim in.\r\n\r\nI pondered the artistic, ethical, cultural & commercial implications
    of this exercise very deeply as I created my first fonts. I grew up deeply immersed
    in Hip-Hop culture & was blessed & lucky to stumble into the ground floor of other
    aspects, not just the font thing. I take it very seriously. To me Hip-Hop is like
    Kung Fu. To others it may me nothing more than a gimmick. \r\n\r\nIt IS offensive
    when someone from outside the culture seeks to profit from it. It IS inappropriate
    for one to co-opt the culture or craft of another for personal gain... but this
    is expected & can not be helped. When a non-writer or novice writer attempts to
    create a graffiti style font the result is obvious. This would seem to be a self-solving
    problem but unfortunately it is not.\r\n\r\nSince the general audience can not
    be expected to understand the intricacies of a complex artform like graffiti what
    happens is that these bastardized styles begin to shape peoples impression of
    graffiti lettering as if it were nothing but a bunch of unsophisticated scribbling
    which is unfortunately what most people think already. As a writer I do not turn
    the styles of other writers into typefaces I stick to my own styles & those of
    writers who seek us out wanting to contribute. \r\n\r\nIt is hard enough to defend
    our intellectual property from the likes of Google without having the waters further
    muddied."

    around the world. My foundry was already on our 3rd large scale cdrom collection
    & getting thousands of visitors to our sites every day.  By this time several
    other popular font sites had added categories for graffiti and a number of very
    real, known & credible graffiti artists as well as several highly skilled & well
    known font developers had been involved in the creation of graffiti style typefaces.
    The oldest digital typefaces created by \"real\" graff writers are from the late
    nineties. I myself first published in 1999.\r\n\r\nOther posts in this thread
    are circa 2007 & while all touching on real issues seem to ignore the reality
    that such art & science as described had already been well explored by then. Open
    type graffiti fonts had long existed already and successful compromises between
    organic graffiti lettering & mechanical type had long since been achieved in full
    view, in the open market & with considerable popularity. \r\n\r\nBy 2009 people
    were posting in this thread about the very real issue that a mechanical fonts
    just cant do what writers do by hand. This is mostly true but also very obvious.
    Graffiti takes many forms some of which are very mechanical & can very successfully
    translate into type\u2026 others not so much. In any case, very talented & highly
    skilled people had worked hard on this issue for over a decade at this point &
    in some cases very successfully.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, a graffiti font is
    used like a headline font. In most cases it's used in an even more prominent,
    specialized & customized manner than even a headline font. In other words graffiti
    fonts are not used usually used to set type. They are used to emulate graffiti.\r\n\r\nNo
    disrespect to anyone who participated in this very intelligent discussion but
    at each stage of this thread the debate is several years behind the reality. Not
    all fonts are free. Not all fonts are popular. Obviously very few graffiti style
    fonts had been used by the people who wrote all this. The internet is a strange
    place & who knows what will end up telling the tale in the end. Just in case this
    article is part of that tale I just had to inject some facts."
