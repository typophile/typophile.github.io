body: "I wonder if anyone has a list or know exactly what diacritics (except acute)
  are being used at the end of a world in any language possible and with what letter?
  Sometimes I feel that it has not much sense to create a ornamented zcaron.end in
  a font. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    the [[http://onelook.com/|OneLook]] dictionary to get a sense of the frequency.\r\n\r\n"
