  Mr. Brown gives an absolutely heroic rational for not just picking font sizes with
  a dartboard app and its well worth watching and listening closely to, although I'm
  in a loud car on Amtrak now with Leon Russel's \"I'll put a spell on you\" blasting
  me along to a date with the brick maps of NYC. \r\n\r\nBack in Tim's presentation,
  he shows one of Aldus' pages and points out how the type and illustrations match
  in intensity, by design. Well, I know they do, and the page Tim shows, shows this
  more than many of the pages of the same book. Is this truely a design choice, or
  is this a production issue?\r\n\r\ne.g.  I know, for sure, from my own era of letterpress
  and lithography, that big contrast between the largest and smallest areas of black
  is a serious inking issue that brings either a failure of blackness of large areas,
  an over-inking of the type, or addition cost from separate runs for each part.\r\n\r\nThis
  is after all why we love Figgins, n sleep with his book under the pillow. Anybody
  got any idears in this area? Is there a thread on this here? "

    of Cheltenham in the 1900s.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>A major concern was integrating
    the graphic quality of image, decoration and type. Linework was often the answer.
    \u201CThere is too, that quality in the engraved or drawn line which harmonizes
    with the varied linear quality of type and dominates the old bookmaking,\u201D
    wrote Charles E. Dawson in the 1909 Penrose Annual, and it was for this reason
    that photo-engraved line drawings continued the traditional magazine illustration
    medium of hand-engraved linework for three decades into the 20th Century, during
    the era of historicist typography. However, the mechanical halftone screen, invented
    in the 1880s, was also widely used for illustrations and photographs, requiring
    a quite different harmony with type. For the halftone establishes a graphic area
    flat upon the page\u2014as indeed do those other magazine design elements, blocks
    of colour and areas of mechanical tone\u2014and Cheltenham, with its low stroke
    contrast, and lack of hairlines, tapered serifs or thinned joints, exhibits a
    NON-varied linear quality which plays to those layout elements. With its almost
    monoline construction and slab serifs, it has much the effect of the later modernist
    geometric slab serif types such as Stymie and Rockwell; with its simple linearity
    it is a pop-art version of what a serifed type looks like. It does not consist
    of part area, part line, as types with a pronounced contrast of thick and thin
    strokes and varied detailing do\u2014suggesting depth and complexity\u2014but
    may be considered as all-monoline or, at larger sizes and bolder weights, all
    area, so that it lies flat upon the page, and herein lies its modernity and suitability
    for use with halftones; either separate, or knocked out. </blockquote>"

    font, another printing technology and another time. I think there are enough points
    like this for a very interesting history of design according to the dance of font,
    technology and economics?

    talking about this subject of text and image ideally matching in colour, and I've
    been trying to push the idea through my brain into a real world understanding.
    Your explaination definitely helps."

  body: But text and image of matching color is just one of the many of ways of designing
    things aesthetically pleasing. It happens to be a safe one, for those stuck in
    bad eras of production, or where limited imagination rules. Isnt it contrast,
    as opposed to a lack thereof that draws eyeballs in design today, and most of
    this century?

    the only change; the density of information within publication is increasing and
    notions about so-called classical designs with huge margins and the modernist
    hangup on tracts of whitespace are dying off. Ellen Lupton brings this up in the
    second edition of <em>Thinking With Type</em>; which, along with her book <em>Graphic
    Design: The New Basics</em>, provides a nice example of how a great deal of information
    can be packed into a relatively small book and still be a nice read. \r\n\r\nThis
    seems connected to the constant change in the function of the book. Those huge
    margins are no longer needed in world where people rarely use them to take notes;
    a publication with carefully considered even color on every page is not relevant
    in a world where few people will sit down to savor such an experience."

    cause printing problems for offset lithography, the way it did for traditional
    letterpress.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I think the reason Cheltenham is so generally
    excoriated these days doesn't have anything to do with its overall characteristics,
    but rather that the shape of certain elements in the letters - the rounded bowls
    in them come to mind - gives the face a quaint and out-of-date appearance.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it combines elements of an oldstyle type with other design elements that were
    up-to-date when the face was designed; this kind of mixture is usually associated
    with faces that date badly, while faces that truly represent their era consistently
    live on (Garamond, Bodoni, Clarendon, Franklin Gothic, Futura). Although I think
    that Times Roman will be an exception to this generalization, as the problem depends
    on <em>what</em> is combined, and <em>how</em>."

    to successfully use some of the features that it originates. Nobody else dares
    lift that stuff because it would be so obvious, but because nobody does Cheltenham
    will always stand out in the eyes of designers."
