body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>First post! As part of my ordinary secondary-level &#40;high
  school&#41; education, I do Art. One of our four exams is a design project. We get
  the brief a week before the exam but all the work must be done from scratch in two-and-a-half
  hours.  <BR> <BR>I did this by way of practice for this exam. No computers allowed!
  It was all graph paper and steel rules, done finally in Indian Ink on an A3 sheet
  of cartridge paper. It was my first experience drawing lettering in any meaningful
  way. <BR> <BR>The brief was to design a logo for a costume hire company. <BR>  <BR>What
  do you think? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s room for improvement! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68660.gif"

  body: First off, welcome to Typophile. <BR> <BR>Secondly, your logotype has a decent
    concept and layout in this drawing, so that&#39;s good, but the strokes are weak.
    It&#39;s a very tricky but extremely important part of drawing type, particularly
    script faces. <BR> <BR>Without going into too much detail, what you want to do
    is draw the skeleton of the type, then apply the strokes to that, rather than
    drawing the outline. The strokes &#40;in &#39;Queen&#39;&#41; are meant to appear
    drawn with a brush or pen with which you can control the thicks and thins, right?.
    Right now, the strokes don&#39;t feel like fluid, organic, modulating line. I&#39;d
    either get a Speedball pen or a brush and play around, or visit the site of Underware
    &#40;a Dutch font house&#41;. They have some great curvy, full-bodied script fonts
    you could look at, such as <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=bello&amp;id2=overview">Bello</a>.
    They also have a site where they archive their <a href="http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics">student
    workshops</a>, that may help you understand how letters are constructed and designed
    &#40;without buying a book on the subject&#41;. <BR> <BR>Focus on &#39;Queen&#39;
    first. Fix the strokes, close the space between the &#39;Q&#39; and the &#39;U&#39;,
    and let that &#39;n&#39; have a slightly more dramatic finish. <BR> <BR>Do that,
    then go back and tweak &#39;DRAMA&#39;.

  body: To help with the drawing process you might want to buy/borrow a set of french
    curves and some elipse tempates. Two and a half hours is a tight deadline, so
    you need to make it as easy on yourself as possible. On a type front the letters
    with curves at the top and bottom aceos etc should have a slightly larger x-height
    than the others. <BR>Good luck <BR>Tim

  body: 'I misinterpreted your post. I thought you meant that this was the result
    of the exam and you wanted to tweak it. I agree with Tim on the french curves,
    if you aren&#39;t going to try a brush. <BR> <BR>A few more tweaks: Maybe this
    is just me, make your &#39;e&#39;s more e-like. They&#39;re a tad bit too vertical
    for my taste. Also, splay the legs of the &#39;A&#39;s a bit more to open up the
    counter &#40;the space inside the &#39;A&#39;&#41;. Make your &#39;D&#39; less
    pointed and more bowled and curved. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-no-2/">Trade
    Gothic Bold No.2</a> is probably a good model for the &#39;DRAMA&#39;. <BR> <BR>Good
    luck.'

  body: Thanks, Chris and Tim, for the helpful advice. I&#39;m going to get the pens/brushes/set-of-curves
    you suggested and will give it another go taking your suggestions into consideration.
    I&#39;ll keep you posted with the results. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>P.S. That Underware resource is fantastic! I&#39;ve
    been on their mailing list for ages but never spotted those diagrams. Thanks!

  body: Yes, a rapidograph pen and french curves are going to help. You can jack your
    curves up with some thin label stickers so the ink won&#39;t run underneath the
    curves. Apply the stickers to the side that sits against your coated illutration
    board so they lift the curve up from the surface. <BR> <BR>Best of luck.
