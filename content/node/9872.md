    expired.. <BR> <BR><i>&#40; They should definitely try hard to still renew, and
    keep it, because otherwise someone will sure catch it.. And it may not be them,

  body: Just got word from Joshua - his domain expiring was due to  <BR>an oversight.
    <a href="http://www.shiftype.com/" target="_blank"> Shiftype</a> is already back
    online. Here&#39;s the page  <BR>for <a href="http://www.shiftype.com/fonts/detail.asp?id=M1900&amp;tpl=betasans/detail.html"
    target="_blank"> Beta Sans</a>. Make sure to check out its companion <a href="http://www.shiftype.com/fonts/detail.asp?id=M1910&amp;tpl=betasemi/detail.html"
