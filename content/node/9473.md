body: 'So, my company bought one of the brand-new FontShop OpenType faces, FF Nexus,
  and as I was dropping it into our templates to test size and leading I noticed a
  very odd thing. As part of the standard ligatures, the s_t combination was included.
  This particular ligature is not one I expected to see in the standard set, especially
  since the discretionary ligatures contains the rest of the historical ligatures
  &#40;c_t, f_s, etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>Of course, this causes a problem, as in order
  to get any ligatures, I have to turn on the standard set, but then I automatically
  get the s_t ligature. Which of course, I don&#39;t want. <BR> <BR>FontShop has offered
  to fix this for me &#40;very nice of them indeed&#41; by removing the s_t ligature,
  but it&#39;s got me wondering, should there be a standard for OpenType of which
  ligatures should be in the standard set? <BR> <BR>My preference for the standard
  set would be: <BR> <BR>f_f <BR>f_i <BR>f_l <BR>f_f_i <BR>f_f_l <BR> <BR>The discretionary
  set can contain the rest. I&#39;d love to see a function built into InDesign that
  lets you set which ligatures the program uses, but I suppose that&#39;s another
  question entirely.'

    rarer f-ligs sith letters such as b, j, k, and sometimes t. They are rare in the
    sense that most typefaces don&#39;t have them, but if present they would go in
    standard ligatures. <BR> <BR>Also, once you get out of the realm of normal text
    faces, and push into things like script or handwriting fonts, there may be many
    more standard ligatures. <BR> <BR>Finally, Adobe is fond of the &#34;Th&#34; ligature
    - as am I - and puts it in standard ligatures &#40;&#39;liga&#39;&#41;. However,
    there is some debate as to whether it belongs in the standard ligatures or it
    should be discretionary. I prefer it in standard ligatures, myself. <BR> <BR>Setting
    which ligatures the app uses would be interesting, but would have to interact
    with specific fonts. Maybe one of these days, though. You can always put in a

    just for ligatures, but for other substitutions as well, effectivly building your
    own style stylistic set for different fonts.

  body: Thomas, I agree that the st lig should be in the &#39;hlig&#39; &#40;that
    stands for historical ligatures, right?&#41; <BR> <BR>Since the OpenType panel
    shows which features are available, it seems like a little more coding would allow
    you to toggle specific sets of ligatures &#40;sort of like the semi-functioning
    &#34;fi, fl but not ffi ffl&#34; ligature function in Quark 4 &amp; 5&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Still not sure why FontShop added s_t to the standard ligatures. I hope that
    they drop that, otherwise I&#39;m going to have to request custom versions of
    every OpenType font I get from them.

  body: Yes, &#39;hlig&#39; is historical ligatures. <BR> <BR>If somebody making an
    OpenType font wanted to specify additional levels of ligatures, they could always
    use stylistic sets to do it. <BR> <BR>As for FontShop, I wouldn&#39;t assume anything
    from one of their first OpenType fonts. It&#39;s probably either a bug or an individual
    designer&#39;s choice, not a long-term general policy decision by the foundry.

  body: one problem with using the 'hlig' feature for discretionary ligatures is that
    Photoshop CS does not reference the 'hlig' feature. This might not be such a problem
    if there were a glyph pallete in Photoshop, but to my knowledge there isn't one.

    pretty ironic that a suite of 'design' programs that are meant to work together

    the liga-feature, although it does not necessarily improve the legibility. The
    t in longs_t is often much more different in comparison to the single t, than
    b, i and so on are different in longs_b, longs_i and so on.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t
    see any reason for putting the longs-ligatures into the hlig-feature. In case

    which is absurd in my opinion.\r\n\r\nGenerally I either would put each ligature,
    that improves the legibility and that is not just decorative into the liga feature
    or I simply would follow the way, that Adobe goes with regard to these features,
    because if everyone programs the features totally different, each font needs a
    manual and it is hard to switch from one font to another one."

    \"let the end user modify the font\" would resolve that, but FontFont has lately
    prohibited people who actually use fonts from using them to best advantage.\r\n\r\nA
    good number of fonts could use more ligatures, esp. in italic: g_g, g_y, z_z,
    z_y, and so on. Sometimes roman too -- gg, as in \"struggle\" can appear as an
    awful blot. Adobe Jenson comes to mind, as seen in <cite>The Pacific</cite> (World

    apply Character Style 'liga' or 'dlig' to particular glyph combinations:\r\n\r\nFind:

    tracking can be better accommodated using a non-ligature approach. Contextual
    alternates generally result in a smaller, more efficient glyph set than ligatures,
    and easily produce arbitrary combinations of e.g. diacritic glyphs in 'ligated'
    sequences which would require hundreds of ligatures. In fonts that support GPOS
    mark positioning, using contextual alternates avoids the complexity of enumerated
    anchor attachments on ligature glyphs."
