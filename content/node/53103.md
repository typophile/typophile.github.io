  the image... best my iPhone could capture). Wish I could remember the publication
  but I can't recall. \r\n\r\nIn any case, the thin, uppercase type used for the title
  of the food is what I'm interested in identifying. Looks like a Condensed version
  of Gotham, but it's obviously not that. \r\n\r\nAny ideas are appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_Typophile_recipe_6258.jpg]"

    \r\n\r\nGloriola is nice, but dips below the baseline and this doesn't. Good call
    on the SkySans too, however, the leg of the \"R\" is much different.\r\n\r\nHmmm... "

    Sans</a>.
