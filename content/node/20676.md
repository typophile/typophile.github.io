  specific letter. I know there must be loads, but they are hardly listed in any Typography
  book. Does anyone know any funny, interesting, exciting stories? It could also be
  a surprising type-historical fact.\r\n\r\nI love this one for example: \r\nwww.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=21501\r\nThis
  story is about a Sabotage act in the White House which apparently happened shortly
  before George W Bush and his staff moved in. Apparently the former staff made a
  practical joke and removed as many \"W\" keys from all the keyboards in the White
  house as they could.\r\n\r\nThanks sharing any more stories!\r\n\r\nFox\r\n\r\n"

    It's a close digitization of his own writing. \r\n\r\nHe told me once he knew

    to confirm the \"truth\" of it or not... but I believe him ;-P )\r\n\r\nMany,
    many years ago, Ed had worked on some logo designs for El Al, based on a stylized
    manora. El Al decided not to use the designs, so Ed shelved them. (Actually, he
    put them into his famous \"drawer\" of ideas and sketches.)\r\n\r\nA few years
    later, United Airlines was looking to update their logo. Ed pulled out the El
    Al manora, deleted a few of the candelabra arms, and came up with the logo below

      And I think you've all already heard the Chase logo story--I posted it some
      years back. \r\n\r\nOkay, I've got two I love (sorry so long):\r\n\r\n1. In
      the pre-desktop days, I used to give Photolettering a lot of business and Sid
      Haber would take me to lunch sometimes. One time, he told me that he started
      as a young man as a linotyper, and one night, he had a blind date. It was love
      at first sight! He knew he was going to marry this girl. He said he was so excited,
      that he had to set some type. So he took her up to the shop and and set \"I
      love you,\" and put it in her hand. And it burned her! And they got married
      and she still had the scar on her hand.\r\n\r\n2. Right out of school, I had
      the great privilege of interviewing with Herb Lubalin to be his assistant on
      U&lc. Well, it turned out that I interviewed him. I spent all day with him and
      he showed me and reminisced about all his favorite work. When we got to the
      PBS logo (the \"P\" as a head), he was infurated . . . he said that PBS used
      it for a while, everything was fine and then they decided it wasn't good that
      the face was facing LEFT. So they gave it to Chermayeff & Geismar to rework
      and Lubalin said they just basically stole his logo and just turned it around.\r\n\r\nWell,
      20 years later, I'm at Chermayeff & Geismar and told Tom Geismar the story and
      Tom loved it and said Herb was crazy and PBS approached him to rework the logo
      to show they were a corporation of many public stations--not just one. And it
      worked better facing right.\r\n\r\nI believe them both. (p.s. I got the job!
      But Lubalin died a week later ;( )"

    Saul Bass designed United Airlines' great logo in 1974. I've also heard this from
    a designer who is a great admirer of Saul Bass, so I believe it.\r\n\r\nThe menorah

  body: "There's this story about Alexandre Wollner visiting Herb Lubalin in New York.
    He says:\" H.Lubalin had this three-floor office in N.Y. The main room was as
    big as Alexandre Wollner's house with tables covered with sweets and chocolates.
    Wollner asked him what the room was for and how he managed all the luxury when
    he (Wollner) back in Sao Paulo couln't even dream of having such an adequate room.
    He replied:\" I'm going to tell you a secret: on the first floor there's a room
    full of people working, but they only do retail down there, which I don't show
    to anyone and which doesn't appear in any book. We make a lot of money there.
    On the 2nd floor we produce pubblications of a slightly higher level:some adverts,
    but mostly magazine page spreads, medical pamphletes, and these make reasonable
    money. I don't publish this stuff anywhere either. Then there's is this room here
    where I do the things you see; the Avant garde alphabet, Eros magazine etc. These
    don't bring in a dime, they just cost money. It's the 1st floor that sustains
    the other 2. I don't know if this is the sort of anecdotes you are looking for
    but I've found it cool because now, when I visit some super high profile studio
    (not that I do this a lot...) I always think about the secret floors.\r\nThe story
    is from Alexandre Wollner published by CosacNaify in Brazil (a project by Andre
    Stolarski)"

    abroad work. (I'm based in Amsterdam.) However I was wondering if anyone has a
    any more anecdotes connected to a specific letter, like the missing \"W\" story
    i posted in the beginning? Another interesting thing which came to mind is:\r\nLooking
    at the letterfrequency of the English language, the most used character is not
    \"E\" as  it's mostly believed (11.2%)  but the actual \"Space\" character (13.2%).

  body: "Enjoying these anecdotes, and thought to add one in keeping with the general
    tone of the responses.\r\n\r\nRecently I finished reading a very well written
    book, \"Book Typography\" by Ari Rafaeli. There are many historical examples of
    types attributed to the wrong original designer. Much of the drama of early type
    is determining who did what. My favorite from the book is the story of Monotype
    Ehrhardt. Seems the original designer, a Nicholas Kis from the Holland, left town
    and ended up in Poland (c1680). He tried to sell his matrices to Edling Type Foundry.
    Edling thought Kis' work amaturish and declined to purchase the matrices. Kis
    left the matrices with Edling while he scoured the area for a buyer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    for Kis, he was arrested by the king. He was later released on the condition he
    promise to never bring invading armies into Poland again. Seems the King blamed
    Kis for his recent political troubles. \r\n\r\nKis left town and abandoned the
    matrices. They stayed with the Edling Foundry, passed on as companies were sold
    and acquired. Ultimately the matrices ended up with Stempel who issued a version
    from the original. The kicker for Kis is they attributed the design to Janson
    (Edling's mentor/master) who was not there when Kis first arrived at Edling's
    Foundry.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nLTL,\r\nXtian"

    hole is the least filling part of a doughnut.  \r\n\r\nBut in the spirit of this
    discovery I nominate '2pt leading' as the most used 'letter' in the English language,
    so many books include this invisible letter above, or below, each character printed
    in the book.  "
