    old Gap logo was just fine.

  body: "One site claims it was designed by lairdandpartners.com. I took a quick look
    at their site and saw that they do graphic design work for Gap, but I didn't see
    any mention of the new logo.\r\n\r\nMy first impression is that the new logo is
    awful, but I'd like to hear the Gap's reasons for the change. My guess is that
    their previous logo looked a bit old and stuffy to their target audience of younger
    people, like the logo of a place their parents would shop at. And perhaps Helvetica
    is viewed differently by younger folks who weren't even born yet when it was at
    the height of its popularity."

    hoping that the furor will blow over quickly, especially if people become sidetracked
    into judging a bunch of amateurish submissions. \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't blow over,

    logo was designed by Trey Laird and his firm Laird and Partners, who have served
    as Gap\u2019s creative directors for many years, while working closely with Gap
    of North America president Marka Hansen. While Chandler stresses that Gap stands
    by the logo they\u2019ve created, they also want it to signify that the company
    itself is changing \u2014 and that should come with input from consumers.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m
    not going to comment on specific aspects of the dialogue. But we\u2019re thrilled
    about the energy and passion that customers have shown. We want to collaborate
    with them.\u201D\r\n\r\n   \u2014 Bill Chandler, vice president of corporate communications
    \r\n\r\nThe article also includes an interesting open letter from the well-respected
    design firm of Siegel+Gale, which would like to get the job of redesigning the

    being presented with the logo were a load of design-illiterate suits being talked
