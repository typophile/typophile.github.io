  body: 'Rich is correct, there will be a Bruce Rogers exhibit on display at MCBA
    during TypeCon. The non-digital TC03 workshops will be held at their wonderful
    facilities, and we&#39;ll also hold an evening event there during the conference.
    There will be plenty of opportunities to see the show. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post
    here as soon as the full TypeCon website is launched - it will be ready within
    the next month! '

    beginning first thing Friday morning and running through Sunday at 6pm.  <BR>
    <BR>There will also be several special evening events every night as an integral
    part of the conference. <BR> <BR>Online registration will begin end of Feb./first

    added programming and special events. <BR> <BR>More information to come...
