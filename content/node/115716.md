body: "I'm prototyping a cursive font where, at least on paper, any word with a \"t\"
  in it has the crossbar on the t extended to the left and right over letters as long
  as this fits; verticals in h, l, d, etc. will cut off the bar, so something like:\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface/images/01.jpg\">\r\n\r\nbecomes
  something like:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface/images/02.jpg\">\r\n\r\nI'm
  not entirely sure how to implement this, though. I was thinking of using many-to-many
  GSUB rules based on glyph classes, but no matter how I look at it, it turns into
  needing recursive GSUB behaviour...\r\n\r\n1) t [low] ->[t with bar that continues
  right]  [low with left-connecting overbar]\r\n2) [low with left-connecting overbar]
  [low] ->[low with fully connecting overbar] [low with left-connecting overbar]\r\n3)
  [low with left-connecting overbar] [high] -> [low with fully connecting overbar]
  [high with lef-connecting overbar stub]\r\n\r\nand rule 2 would have to recursively
  kick in... and that's just in one direction.\r\n\r\nHas anyone every tried something
  like this before? Or does anyone have thoughts on how this might be achieved?\r\n\r\n"

    it is POC, you need to add some glyphs and substitute i,j with dotless i,j \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_3918.jpg]"

  body: awesome, thanks! although I'm curious why the feature cuts off on the 'u'
    in ligatures, but not the 'u' in features.

  body: "Because I was lazy and did not make one line of the code and one glyph (3
    letters, t, 4 letters)...\r\nTo be honest, much more is required, e.g. \"transparency\"
    - t11."

  body: If I'm reading this correctly, the substitutions are simpy t's with longer
    bars, right? They're fixed length and you might have iiiiit have an overhang to
    the left compared to aaaaat due to the glyph width of 'i' being a fraction of
    'a'?

  body: "Another option I was considering was a substitution for every low class glyph
    with a macron counterpart, so that [t] + [low] contextually becomes [t-extended]
    + [low with macro], then simply have a huge block that goes [low macron] + a \u2192
    [same] + \u0101, and repeat the block a stupid number of times to get the \"recursive\"
    length desired, with terminations like \u0101 + l \u2192 [l with a left-terminator],
    etc.\r\n\r\nBut they're both not ideal solutions =/"
