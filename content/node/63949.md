  body: "Jan, as usual, thank you very much for your time and your answer. Perfect
    match!\r\nFor the first one, I just can't believe it's custom... It's a very small
    restaurant and if I clearly remember, they use this typeface for the rest of their
    collaterals (menus...). \r\nSimilars or base font are welcome of course. Thanks."

  body: "Thanks a lot Stephen and Mike.\r\nThe more I look at \"tiramisu\", the more
    I think it's a mix between regular and upright letters (\"a\", \"m\", \"s\" and
    \"u\" coming from the italic). FB Belizio would have been a start..."
