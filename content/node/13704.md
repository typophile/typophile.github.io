  called [[Caroline]].\r\n\r\nAround [[800]], [[Charlemagne]]\u2014king of the Franks
  and the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire\u2014decided that all his lands should
  write out their Latin texts with the same handwriting style (even though he himself
  was illiterate). His court scholars developed a hand, which was loosely inspired
  by a variety of [[Uncial]] styles. This has been called Carolingian Minuscule by
  historians, and it looks almost identical to our current lowercase Latin alphabet.\r\n\r\nDuring
  the Renaissance (c.[[1465]]), two German printers, [[Conrad Sweynheym]] and [[Arnold
  Pannartz]], were hired by a monastery in Subiaco, [[Italy]]. Seeking to find a more
  Italian alphabet for their new employers (as opposed to the Teutonic blackletter
  type of their homeland), the two sought to research classical Roman literature.
  However they unknowingly were reading [[9th century ce|ninth-century]] transcriptions
  in Carolingian Minuscule and falsely assumed that this was actually an Ancient Roman
  invention, just like \"capital\" monumental letters. The two combined the two alphabet
  forms in text\u2014[[uppercase|upper]] and [[lowercase]]\u2014just like we do today
  (actually, we only do it because they started it\u2026). The first italian \"Roman\"
  typefaces (like [[Nicholas Jenson]]'s work in Venice), borrowed this two-case innovation
  from the scribes."
