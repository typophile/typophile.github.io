They are all real girly girls and my wife loves the shoe concept that I came up with for the card.  I am wondering what advice you can give me for a good companion to Brothers Regular.  I have the rest of the card done in Brothers Reg also, I think it is too much - - and hard to read at smaller sizes.  Whadayathink? <BR> <BR>thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Shawn <BR> <BR>really nice idea! <BR> <BR>I like the simplicity of the card and i think Brothers are the right choice. <BR> <BR>Anyway if you need a font to make contrary to Brothers and make a connection to &quot;fabulous&quot; i would recommend Stuyvesant and a more round and shophisticated design to the shoe. So you will have two levels. The retro simple lettering of the accompaning text and the &quot;fabulous&quot; lettering of the key words (shoes, Fabulous, Megan Dunning). <BR> <BR>I tried something to show the contrast of the fonts and my recommendation for the colour, but i will send my proposal only if you ask me to, because maybe you don't want to get disturbed by &quot;other's designs&quot; and also because the last time i did it there was a negative reaction. So tell me. <BR> <BR>Nice idea, anyway. Have a nice day too. <BR> <BR>christos</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Shawn, <BR> <BR>Great concept . . . Right away I am wanting to know what I need to buy new shoes for! (all women love shoes, don't they?!) <BR> <BR>Is this a postcard or a folded invite? <BR> <BR>I think the first color scheme works best . . . you could try leaving the cover the full black bleed and on the inside (or back) have the &quot;flood of pink&quot; as Joseph suggested. This color of pink to me, however, reminds me more of a baby announcement rather than a bachelorette party . . . <BR> <BR>I like the contrast of Stuyvesant with Brothers &ndash; I don't think the layout works as well anymore; with this new font you may need to  experiment with some different ways to present the type. <BR> <BR>I am still leaning towards the first cover design you presented, I love the bold stamplike quality of it,  it really makes a statement compared to the other designs. Perhaps you could try some sort of decorative swoop or accent on the shoe that would tie in the new Stuyvesant font used on the inside? I don't know if that would work, but it might sparks some ideas for you. <BR> <BR>Props on the idea, Shawn, your concept definitely states &quot;classy and fun.&quot;</div>
