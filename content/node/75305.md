  body: "Raster Bank Twenty One? Just did a whatfontis.com search, spotted Raster
    Bank Twenty One- thought, mmm that's it... clicked it to see closer but consequently
    lost all the other results... bummer.\r\n\r\nThe N is very very similar. If you
    have any idea how big this is- a point size, this helps build a picture (for me
    at least!)\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.whatfontis.com/Raster-Bank-Twenty-One-marksimonson.font]]\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit:
    Scratch that, the E is totally different, unless it's a variant. Also, the O is
    different between univers cond. and your image.</cite>"

  body: It will be difficult to be certain given the quality of the sample. What about
    <a href="http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013">Knockout</a>?

  body: Yeah I know, sorry about that I couldn't find a better sample. It looks like
    Knockout doesn't quite go light enough while remaining that wide. All the really
    light weights in knockout seem to be really condensed.
