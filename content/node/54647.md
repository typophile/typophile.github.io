body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of re-writing and re-designing my resume.
  I would appreciate your help in identifying the right typeface to match the character
  of my resume (rough draft attached). Specifically, this would be for printed or
  PDF use.\r\n\r\nI find it difficult to show character in the limited space a resume
  affords, but I'd like to think I've set a tone of analytical, creative problem-solving
  with hints of a passion to explore and understand.\r\n\r\nMy financial resources
  are constrained, but I am willing to invest in a strong, well-designed typeface.
  So tell me\u2014what's out there? What would you use?\r\n\r\nMy sincere thanks.\r\n\r\nEvan"

  body: "Thank you all for your suggestions.\r\n\r\nPaul, I like FF Scala quite a
    bit. I think I will try that. Do you recommend using Scala with itself for headings
    or are there other typefaces that would better compliment it for that use?"

  body: "That's your call. I actually used it for my resum\xE9 as well. I actually
    used ScalaSans Small Caps for my headings. It makes for subtle, elegant headers.
    Even at the same size, the sans serif attracts your eye enough to function as
    a header.\r\n\r\nI've since updated my resum\xE9 and now I have Gotham Light as
    headers with HTF-Didot for the text. It's quite the sexy pairing."
