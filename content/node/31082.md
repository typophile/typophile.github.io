  body: Non-Format work with custom-made faces, if I'm not mistaken. I don't think
    they are available commercially.

  body: I think it's more like Non-Format like to add very heavy strokes to their
    fonts like Nicholas suggested. But it's possible that they then turn them into
    custom fonts.

  body: "I've fiddled around with heavy stroke, and it seems like they made a custom
    font by adding different size of strokes to the individual characters.\r\n\r\nIf
    you add enough stroke go get an R to look like that, an E would just be a square
    ... and so on. Or maybe I just haven't found the right font yet ;-)\r\n\r\n/megl"

  body: I bet it's a combo of the heavy stroke and manual dropping/filling in some
    of the counters or, in the R, the space btw the legs. I really don't like the
    way the C turned out tho. And there are some strange inconsistencies - such as
    between the M and W.
