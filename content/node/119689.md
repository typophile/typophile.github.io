body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI am struggling to find a good pair for Ratio type that
  I use for body (I use typekit so I'm constrained here). I would like something in
  headings to complement Ratio.\r\n\r\nAdelle seems to be fine for headings. Rooney
  Web seems to play nicely too. I have also tried Jubilat in heavier weights (even
  italics) and seems to be... ok.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about these combinations?
  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
