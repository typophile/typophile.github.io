body: This type design is was designed for a company that pressure washes large commercial
  trucks and industrial  <BR>sites. Icon still in works.  <BR>One challenge was to
  make this match former logo.  <BR>I did former logo a year ago when company was
  called Pressure Washers. Name was changed as company got a lot of requests from
  people wanting to buy pressure washing equipment, so old identity/business has remained
  but now sells equipment. text for collateral and promotional materials will be set
  in Henrik Kubel&#39;s Klampenborg. The type face I designed for this project is
  based on Klampenborg. <BR>  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51736.jpg"

  body: Interesting face <BR> <BR>The slanted stroke endings make me a little uneasy.
    Maybe they could work better if they integrated more with adjacent letters. Ole,
    it is hard to say. The &#34;I&#34; for example has 3 dimensional quality and a
    flat quality at the same time.???? I guess as always my instict would be to simplify
    the typeface more. The R doesn&#39;t need so many angles in it&#39;s terminal.
    Or maybe it does. Some variations would be nice to see. Still a very fresh looking
    face. Reminds me of a Din AG combo.
