body: The face is Electra, but is it metal? <BR> <BR>My hunch is yes, though I pause
  only because <BR>the book was last printed in 1969 though I just purchased <BR>the
  copy with its newly designed cover two months ago. <BR> <BR>The book, &#34;A Special
  Providence&#34; is by Richard Yates. <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t recommend it - try his
  Revolutionary Road first&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, it&#39;s at least a worthy exercise
  to see Electra in <BR>metal&#40;?&#41; if only to understand how radically technology
  <BR>can alter the original intent of a typeface. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70650.jpg"

  body: I guess I should add - is there any reason to believe this <BR>sample is photo
    type? If not, was it common to set a book <BR>in metal during the late &#39;60s?
    <BR>&#40;the generous page color, rich inking and casual baseline <BR>lead me
    to believe it&#39;s metal&#41;  <BR> <BR>If it helps, the book was originally
    published by Knopf.

  body: It&#39;s hard to tell, but considering you mentioned a newly designed cover,
    my guess is this has been photographed of an original &#40;probably galleys or
    a pristine copy&#41; and offset webprinted.
