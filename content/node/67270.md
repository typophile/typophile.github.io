  and graphs, and was wondering if anyone has any hard data on these guys I can use?
  Like number of typefaces made, books written etc. Anything you can think of really,
  I'd be most grateful!\r\n\r\n*edit* Oops, I forgot, that's Morris Fuller Benton

  body: Your school has this amazing place called a library. It is a huge room, maybe
    even a building or two, full of books relevant to your studies. There will even
    be people working there who will help you find exactly what you need. And you
    might as well use it, because I guarantee you that some of the cost of keeping
    it open is coming out of your tuition.

    \r\n\r\nbemerx25: \r\nI have done some research, and will continue to do more,
    but so far I haven't found concrete answers to the two specific answers in my
    previous post (how many typefaces have they made and how many books have they
    written). The reason I haven't got more specific questions is that I would like
    to get some input as to what to include in the poster (IF anyone has got an idea
    that they are willing to share!)\r\n\r\nJames: \r\nWhile your sarcasm is helpful,
    I don\u2019t see the hurt in using Typophile as a resource in addition to any
    others available. Do you eat steak with only a knife, even if you got a fork as
    well? I have always perceived Typophile to be an open and helpful community, but
    if it is not supposed to be used as a resource as I have tried to do here, then
    I am sorry. It certainly won't happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, unless I have stepped
    on some toes here, I would still like some help. Most of all I need ideas as to
    what to include, but if anyone has any specific data to share, I'd be much obliged.
    If not, I'll find out somehow (I recently learned of something called a \u201Clibrary\u201D!)."

    you get the idea. And definitely make use of your local library. Maybe you should
    be asking something like, \"What's the most authoritative book on Adrian Frutiger
    and his work?\" Then we might be able to supply some better information (and no,
    I don't know the answer to that).\r\n\r\nAs far as your idea behind the poster...
    You (and your teacher) will have to decide what's necessary for this design project
    to succeed. Personally I'd love to see specimens of their typefaces. Perhaps pick
    one or two faces that represent their creator and set some type."

  body: "bemerx25: \r\nYes, I realise now that it could appear that way from how I
    wrote it, but let me reassure you that I intend to do my own heavy lifting! I'm
    finding it hard to ask the right questions, I guess. Okay. I'll try posing a new
    question then, that I think is more suited to Typophile's unique capabilities
    as a discussion forum:\r\n\r\n<strong>What quantifiable qualities can one assign
    to a type designer, apart from the number of typefaces he or she has made?</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd
    I would hate for anyone to think me so lazy as to not even bothering to check
    Wikipedia before taking up anyone elses time! I have read the wikis for all the
    designers, as well as a slew of books (American Type Designers, A Secret History
    of Letters, that huge Jan Tschichold book which name eludes me right now, and
    a couple more). However, all the Wikipedia entries states say things like \"Typefaces
    Tschichold designed include\" \u2013 \"include\" being the word that troubles
    me. Anyway, nevermind that \u2013 I'll find the numbers somehow.\r\n\r\nFlorian:\r\nThank
    you! I will see if our library has those first thing tomorrow. I'm doubtful of
    the Frutiger one though, if it is recently published as you say. But I'll keep
    my fingers crossed!\r\n\r\nJames:\r\nYou are being less than gracious. You are
    assuming that I have done no work whatsoever, which isn't true. My first post
    was poorly worded, and I have apologized for that. But even if I was asking for
    you to give me something for nothing, there is no need to lash out like you do.
    Do you kick beggars too? Now, I have posted a new question, which I hope is to
    his majesty's liking. If not, then there is no need to waste your time (see, that's
    the magic trick: If you think someone is about to waste your time, IGNORE that
    someone!)."

    a good idea! That helps, thank you. I can probably divide it further into typefaces

    invented is also interesting, if it applies to these guys...so far I haven't come
    across any new letters made by any of them, except for Tschichold. \r\n\r\nCurve
    points might be hard to apply to anyone except Frutiger...and I suspect I won't
    find any data on that anywhere, not even here!\r\n\r\nFamily members I could also

  body: "What's interesting, at a glance, about this list is the distance between
    these guys...both in time and space. It would be simple enough to lay out a timeline
    including each of his accomplishments (type faces designed) to try to draw some
    connections between them. Obviously there is some overlapping in their lives and
    careers...makes you wonder how aware they were of each other, how and if they
    might have influenced each other. It's not like they were googling each other,
    and with living in different parts of the world (at different times)...it's all
    kind of fascinating. Being that each of them accomplished so much without having
    the technology and the global social communities (like this one) we have today
    does call into question how necessary and useful any of this really is. As stated
    above, there are books and libraries, like there always have been. It might be

    you're not really contributing to the thread. I don't think Kottis is asking us
    to do a project for him, but rather give suggestions on aesthetics and resources
    he can use. While Google can be everyone's friend from time to time, sometimes
    a small amount of help from another person may make somebody's job a lot easier.
    Lastly, he asked the right people, and you can't really penalize him for that.
    Lastly, when you look at it, the Wikipedia entries and their sources seem a little
    less full than a more popular/well-known figure of history, thus requiring deeper
    digging.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo shorten that paragraph up and put it in a way I'm used
