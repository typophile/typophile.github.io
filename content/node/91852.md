body: "I am wondering if italic isn\u2019t more a style than small capitals: what
  italic really is if you need to define it precisely?\r\nIn CSS, italic is called
  a \"font-style\" such as in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12463\">dedicated
  page</a> on this website.  Can we imagine that italic is the same type than a rounded
  or outline version of a font?  If italic is just another font, it stays related
  to a typeface, such as weights isn't it?\r\n<a href=\"http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/type_basics/design.htm\">Another
  result</a> of my research tells that \"angle\", \"weight\" and \"width\" are separated
  characteristics.\r\nIf I need to make a typeface database, should I order fonts
  like:\r\n\r\n</strong>Case 1</strong>\r\nIn this case I try to separate weights,
  widths and variants, tags are for typefaces only\r\n<code>\r\nTypeface\r\n -   Tags:
  sans, 1990, grotesque, small caps, ligatures\r\nFont\r\n -   Weight: bold\r\n -
  \  Width: condensed\r\n -   Variant: italic\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n</strong>Case 2</strong>\r\nMore
  flexible with tags only but less precise.\r\n<code>\r\nTypeface\r\n-   Tags: sans,
  1990, grotesque, small caps, ligatures\r\nFont\r\n -   Tags: bold, condensed, italic\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAny
  other idea?\r\nThank you for your help / tips / references."

  body: "According to the current orthodoxy, typefaces\u2014commonly referred to as
    fonts\u2014come in families. \"Font-style\" is a formal taxonomic classification;
    if the W3C consortium had so chosen, the terms could just as easily be \"font-relative,\"
    like \"brainiac sister\" or \"finagling uncle.\" Italics themselves are alternate
    letterforms which may or may not more closely resemble handwriting, are generally
    slanted, and commonly used for emphasis or specific identification purposes\u2014such
    as the title of a book in formal English-language scholarship.\r\n\r\nYou've already
    made your arguments for Case 1 or Case 2, which is usually the case: more \"flexible\"
    language is usually less concise."

    body: "It was an exemple: If a typeface contains ligatures, I should want it to
      appear in search results for \"ligature\". Tags are really free in my case.\r\nAnd
      thank you for your briliant answer.\r\n\r\nEdit \u2014 I just read the text
      you sent Frank. This is really interesting and  I must confess, a bit discouraging:
      \r\n\r\n<cite>As I am busy with this topic for 14 years now I get really desperate
      at times. I can understand why my predecessors did not want to continue to bother
      at some point and why the discussion is preferably avoided at conferences. </cite>\r\n\r\nIn
      the article the question is always about typefaces, but I am also wondering
      about how a font weight can modify the drawing of a typeface: How can I know
      if I am in front of a bold version of a typeface if I don't know anything about
      its context?\r\nAnother question is: Who is supposed to classify the typefaces?
      In a first time, it will be the type designer himself or the foundry, but users
      (designers or not) will own more and more tools to organise their fonts and
      this same people are not supposed to learn complex terminology.\r\nApologies
      for my bad english."
