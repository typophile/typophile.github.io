body: "I'm working with an interior design company and the logo they've given me hasn't
  got proper quality. I don't understand why as it's a corel draw file. When I open
  it in illustrator it's all pixelated and tweaked. It's not that complicated so I
  think I'll redo it. Does anybody know what kind of roman is it made with?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logoatril_3438.jpg]"
