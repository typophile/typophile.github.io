  On The Media: Character Matters</a>\r\n\r\n[[Sam Berlow]] was on one of my favorite
  radio shows this week parsing type for the layman in an entertaining fashion. See
  also his and [[Cyrus Highsmith]]'s <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/gallery/012708_change/\">article
  in <em>The Globe</em>)</a> which was <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/41391\">mentioned
  earlier</a>. He even alluded to Typophile in the interview, saying that there would
  be plenty of discussion about his claim that Hillary's campaign logo is set in Baskerville.
  Who will be the first to chime in?"

    and fonts is popping up in the mainstream media, but not much discussion of how
    much campaign design stinks overall?

  body: 'My guess is that the mainstream media feels it''s not interesting enough
    to the general public. 5 minutes is about the limit of the non-designer''s attention
    span for design and it''s much easier to do a 5 minute piece on the logos than
    try to cover the general concept of each campaign in detail. '
