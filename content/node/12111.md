  Victorian Era faces. \r\n\r\nI know a lot of these aren't digitized, but can anyone
  identify any of the faces in these images which I scanned from an 1898 city directory?
  \r\n\r\nI've attached these as image links, so sorry for the inconvenice, I can't
  seem to upload images with the new maximum file size (anyone know what it is by
  the way? I can't even squeak in tiny little .gif files) and can't link either :(\r\n\r\nAnyways,
  here are the links for anyone willing to cut and paste them:\r\n\r\nhttp://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography1.jpg\r\nhttp://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography2.jpg\r\nhttp://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography3.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!"

  body: TRAIN & HARTY and INSURANCE used a typeface called Columbus Bold. Beaumarchais
    is a digitization of Columbus (not bold). The only digital version of Columbus
    Bold I know of is Brendel Informatik's <a href="http://www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=tc.gif/Stc02155.gif"
    target="_blank">Columbus</a>.

  body: "'Civil Engineer and Architect' was done, I think, in a typeface called Obelisk.
    I'm not aware of any digital versions, though.\r\n\r\nAlternatives might be Letterhead
    Fonts' digitization of Asteroid which they call <a href=\"http://letterheadfonts.com/downloads/index.shtml\"
    target=\"_blank\">LHF Ambrosia</a>. This is squared and upright like Obelisk,
    but perhaps too heavy. A font with a similar weight, but fancier, would be <a
    href=\"http://www.waldenfont.com/content.asp?contentpageID=10\" target=\"_blank\">Jugend
    WF</a> from Walden Fonts."

  body: "Wow. Now here's synchronicity at work; regards the typography.3.jpg - last
    week a student called Minna Pesonen left samples reproduced from a 1906 newspaper
    featuring the very same typeface on my desk, with a request to please identify
    the headline type.\r\n\r\nAlthough I looked for it myself in various references
    (including the very Victorian Typographical Volume, Early Advertising Art by Clarence
    Hornung) to no avail, I also directed her to this site, but without realising
    this particular face was already under discussion.\r\n\r\nLooks like Columbus
    Bold/Beaumarchais is about to enjoy a resurgence in popularity...!"
