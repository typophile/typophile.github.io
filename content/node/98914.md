    Hebrew Calligraphy</em>? It is very good.

    residing in Jerusalem. His new book is one of the best introductions to the script
    that I have seen. It includes, among other things, a nice chapter on analysing
    historical manuscript styles.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.impwriter.com/\r\n"

    they hold back Hebrew typography. Arabic has the same problem (in fact probably
    worse).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Hrant, a deep knowledge of history and of scribal hands is no barrier to
    being innovative in type. I think it''s an advantage, if taken with the right
    spirit. Fred Smeijers is an example of a designer who is both deep into history
    and innovative. '

  body: "Bill,\r\n\r\nWhere can I see examples of Fred Smeijers' work?\r\n\r\nhrant,\r\n\r\nArabic
    as a calligraphic or handwriting script is prone to this. For this reason, there
    are initial, medial, and final, forms to each letter. \r\n\r\nIf you look at Isamar
    David's fine book on Hebrew Letters, only a few of the typefaces presented contain
    \"block\" letters (each font is amazing), while the over-whelming majority of
    typefaces contain calligraphic forms. David was primarily a calligrapher first,
    and a master type designer second.\r\n\r\nSol Malkoff I believe worked with Lilly
    Wonker, who worked with Isamar David for years. Hence, we see David's influence
    upon Sol Malkoff.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, we don't see this calligraphic influence
    by the works of Henri Friedlander, Eliyahu Koren, and Tzvi Narkis, the masters
    of modern Hebrew type design."
