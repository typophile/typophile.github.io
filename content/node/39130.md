body: "A colleague of mine owns Arno Pro. He's doing work which contains transliterations,
  and needs an h with a dot above. He wanted to modify his copy of Arno Pro and add
  it in. When he opened the font in fontlab, he discovered that none of the kerning
  pairs show up, and when it gets saved again, all the kerning (and who knows what
  else) gets stripped from the font.\r\n\r\nI didn't quite believe him, so I took
  a look myself, and sure enough, FontLab shows no kerning. Not in the metrics window,
  and not in the OpenType window. (The feature shows up, but there's no lookups!)\r\n\r\nIs
  Adobe using some new kind of system?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nHarbs"

  body: I checked that and found that final version of Arno Pro uses relatively new
    type 9 lookup which FLS cannot read. We will fix that in the next update.

    will fix the bug in the kerning so that \"quoteright\" and \"quotedblright\" (&
    \"quotedblleft\" and \"quoteleft) have a kern. And the reverse, for users in the
    UK."

  body: "Miguel,\r\n\r\nTake pity on an old print guy. The only way I know to do this
    is to set something in InDesign, export a PDF file, open that up in Photoshop,
    then save the file as a GIF so I can post it. That is a lot of work.\r\n\r\nI
    don't even know how to control the quotes in this forum. Consider:\r\n\r\n\"'Oh'
    he said 'don't do that.'\"\r\n\r\nNow typographically, that is rendered\r\n\r\n/quotedblleft{}/quoteleft{}Oh/quoteright{}/space{}/quoteleft{}don't
    do that/period{}/quoteright{}/quotedblright\r\n\r\nBut that's not what gets displayed.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, in all the Adobe fonts I know, there is no kern between /quotedblleft{}/quoteleft{},
    and there should be -- anything from about 75/1000 to 150/1000, depending on the
    font & word space value. The same between /quoteright{}/quotedblright{}. And in
    the UK, those sequences are reversed, but the kerning should still exist between
    the two quotemarks.\r\n\r\n/quotedblleft{}/quoteright should also have a kern,
    as in \r\n\r\n\"'Tis of the I sing.\"\r\n\r\nFor a different example, using Warnock
    Pro Light, set the string A/quoteright{}/comma{}. The kerning is so tight the
    comma winds up looking like some strange diacritic on the \"A\".\r\n\r\nIf I have
    to (i.e., if it will get things fixed), I'll spend half a weekend setting examples
    to post."

  body: "Hello Charles, it's funny to find this in an Arno thread since kerning in
    Arno is much better than in some older fonts: Quotation marks are spaced generously
    which I like. Two consecutive quotation marks align nicely. And there's kerning
    between quotation marks and comma/period -- and the other way round too.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\nSome
    combinations like&nbsp;&nbsp;A'.&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;V.'&nbsp;&nbsp;may require
    contextual refinement, but this can be said for most typefaces. Yet another dimension
    of kerning horrors ..."

    <em>I don\u2019t even know how to control the quotes in this forum.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    best way I know is by using HTML entities. You can specify them by Unicode (hex),
    decimal or abbreviated form. Here's a short list:\r\nquoteleft \u2013 &#38;#x2018;
    / &#38;#8216; / &#38;lsquo;\r\nquoteright \u2013 &#38;#x2019; / &#38;#8217; /

    \u2013 &#38;#x201D; / &#38;#8221; / &#38;rdquo;\r\n\r\n> <em>In any case, in all
    the Adobe fonts I know, there is no kern between /quotedblleft{}/quoteleft{},
    and there should be [...]</em>\r\n\r\nOK, so something like this? All the lines
    are set in Arno Pro Regular. The top lines show the font as it is currently, with
    no kerning between quotes. The bottom lines have 75/1000 units of kerning.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arno_quotes_3816.png]\r\n\r\n>
    <em>For a different example, using Warnock Pro Light, set the string A/quoteright{}/comma{}.</em>\r\n\r\nYeah,
    it looks bad. This combination requires a kern triplet, or more conservative kerning
    at least.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Warnock_A_quote_6051.png]\r\n\r\n>
    <em>If I have to (i.e., if it will get things fixed), I\u2019ll spend half a weekend
    setting examples to post.</em>\r\n\r\nPlease do. I'll make sure these bugs get
    logged, and will certainly be fixed next time the fonts get revised. No need to
    post them here. You can send the material directly to me at msousa adobe.com\r\n\r\nWhat
    would be nice is if you could post a list of unusual kerning combinations, like
    the quote/quote examples you've just provided. This type of thing should actually
    be posted on the Wiki. If you don't know how to do that, just start a new thread."
