    a custom logo by some big design agency in London but it's crap.\r\n\r\nUse something

  body: thats a fair point however the client is rather keen to use it aswell so I
    dont want to dissapoint them.  I have a feeling it is a custom one aswell- could
    it be VAG or bpprelay but just adapted a lot?
