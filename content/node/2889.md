    be <BR>custom made.

  body: Make no mistake, it&#39;s the same type of script used on an old Swingline
    Stapler or Philco TV :D <BR> <BR>This falls in a category I refer to as a Streamliner
    Scripts. Yes, Leslie has a nice one called Streamline which is similar, I have
    a few at the Diner, but I noticed the Sinatra script when the re-release of the
    Sinatra collection on CD came out a few years back. <BR> <BR>I do intend at some
    point to develop a font inspired by this lettering example for the Diner, but
    I just haven&#39;t gotten to it and it&#39;s not planned into the next font set
    release. <BR> <BR>To be honest, I would recommend starting with Dragonwick and
    recreate your own cap letter to get this effect. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: He did a handlettered Elvis and a Harry Connick, <BR>but he didn&#39;t have
    any Sinatra to show at <BR>his recent AIGA presentation in LA. <BR> <BR>If I remember
    correctly,  <BR>this also resembles the lettering from the  <BR>defunct Goldwaters
    department store chain.

    Looking forward to the next release. If you need an idea try a New York retro
    package

    Typecon meeting and my wifes water broke towards the end of the meeting, he was
