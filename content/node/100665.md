    on the <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/typeid\">Type ID board</a></strong>.
    I will move this thread for you.\r\n\r\n(and it has been my experience that posts
    titled in capital letters get significantly less attention)"

  body: "well, to me it appears to be this font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ffonts.net/Sansation-Bold.font\r\n\r\nwith
    minor alterations to create the logo. (assuming it is one, or some piece of art)\r\nI
    do realize the source seems iffy, but to me and by the bio of the designer this
    seems that it may be free because it is incomplete and basically, amateur/student
    work.\r\n"
