body: I'm now embarking on my final major project at university and thought i would
  post a topic on here about great magazine fonts. I will leave the topic pretty open
  to talk about and let's see what comes from it, so people could suggest individual
  fonts, magazine history, certain typographers, front cover fonts, anything to do
  with magazines. this will be a big help for my research so....cheers.

    women- and fashion mags... ;)
