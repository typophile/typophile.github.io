body: I enjoy writing in calligraphy, and I want to make a font that looks renaissance
  in style, with a stress on the pen and a humanist angle. I am showing an early sketch
  below. I don&#39;t have anyone to show it to, or ask my questions to, so hopefully
  you can help me make it decent. Parts of it look very chancery cursive-like, while
  the capitals, which I haven&#39;t started yet, will probably have more renaissance
  &#39;flair&#39;..possibly.  But please let me know what you think! <BR> <BR>So here&#39;s
  the first JPG. I&#39;ll put down a few of my initial questions/concerns following..
  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" alt="scan01.jpg">
  <BR> <BR>Is this looking like a renaissance typeface? <BR>I like the tall ascenders,
  but how badly will this hurt it if I try to use it in text? <BR>Some of the letters
  are kinda tipsy, like the b and d, but if the uprightness seems okay, they&#39;ll
  be more like the third h, the l and the k. <BR>I have specific questions for several
  letters, but I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s worth continuing first. The only g that I
  like is the one marked down at the bottom. The marks on the w, b, and e just mean
  that I like those versions better than the previous versions on the page. <BR> <BR>All
  comments welcome. It&#39;s my first attempt at a typeface, but I&#39;m very determined
  to make it work. Thanks in advance! I have sketches prior to these, so let me know
  if you want to see previous versions or process of any of the letters. <BR> <BR>

  body: i am by no means an expert on calligraphy, but a friend of mine has made several
    calligraphic fonts that you can view and download from <a href="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Kingthings/fonts/fonts.htm"
    target="_blank"> his website</a>. Kevin&#39;s a good guy and perhaps he could
    be some help at giving you a crit on calligraphic letter forms. In any case his
    fonts are great to look at for inspiration, I think you may want to take a look
    at his Petrock for this one, as i think &#40;i could be very wrong&#41; that it
    is of a similar style as what you are trying to do. Hope this helps!

- body: 'Thanks for the link. I like the &#34;shape&#34; of calligraphic letters..
    the angles mixed in with the round forms; something the petrock light really does
    well. <BR>I&#39;ve been doing some more reading, and I&#39;m redoing all of my
    letters..they&#39;re too handwritten/calligraphic. Hopefully it will turn out
    as something of a cross between jenson/bembo and calligraphy.. leaning more towards
    calligraphy. &#40;the cradle!&#41; &#42;&#42; Not to say it will look as good
    as jenson or bembo.. but that&#39;s the direction i&#39;m re-aiming. ;&#41;   '
