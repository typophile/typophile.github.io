    sheets</a> and set styles for individual characters.

  body: "You can use kerning in a dynamic text field but only in Flash 8 for PC. Still
    there is no way of having kerning in input text. So in a flash font tester one
    has to separate input text and display text (with kerning). See my <a href=\"http://www.fonts.info/flashtest/flashtyper.html\">example</a>.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info"

  body: "Only when I found this thread did I discover that it's not possible to kern
    input fields. However, this is the fix I'm using just now:\r\n\r\nFirstly, make
    sure:\r\n- You have an input TextField created\r\n- You have setup a TextFormat
    object with 'kerning' set to true and 'letterSpacing' set to, for example, -1.\r\n\r\nThen
    use the following code:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nmyTextField.onChanged = function():Void
    {\r\nmyTextField.setTextFormat( theTextFormat )\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI hope
    that helps. If I've missed something and it's actually not a fix, please let me
    know!\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: I just realised this thread's more than a year old :D"
