body: "Certain font were designed to suit certain languages. For instance German needs
  smaller uppercase letters because of so many capitalized words. I imagine that Bodoni
  was designed for Italian. We also know international fonts.\r\nDoes anybody has
  a clue, hint or information about some serious literature about this problem.\r\nI
  am interested in visual characteristics of all official European languages.\r\nThanks
  for any suggestion or help."
