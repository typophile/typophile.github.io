    of typography books. I also recommend their poster collection. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.nijhoflee.nl/design/typography/"

  body: There is also a book store called Minotaurus &#40;Sint-Antoniestraat&#41;,
    I didn&#39;t have the chance to go when i was there three weeks ago, they&#39;re
    closed on mondays, and open late on tuesdays, but it is a store dedicated to typography.
    There&#39;s a poster collectiona at Nijhof &amp; Lee? Missed it, but my wallet
    thanks me for it.

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;I live in Amsterdam and strongly
    recomend going to KOK a &#42;huge&#42; second hand book store. The list of typographic
    material is really big there and the prices much cheaper than N&amp;L and Minotaurus
    &#40;It&#39;s OK to go there, of course, but sometimes in KOK you have the same
    material for half price&#41;. <BR>KOK is in the very downtown and close to Minotaurus.
    <BR> <BR>Check the material and the prices there: <a href="http://www.nvva.nl/kok/typografie.htm"

    student want to visit the KABK or to have a little type-chat with a KABK&#39;s
    student, he can contact me to my mail: <a href="mailto:jazz@futurezone.com">jazz@futurezone.com</a>

  body: I visited the studio of Ewald Spieker when I was over in January, he has a
    gallery containing his work with cut out letters. It was just such a fantastic
    space... it&#39;s just next to a great design bookstore too. Ramiro do you know
    where it is, do you maybe have a street name?
