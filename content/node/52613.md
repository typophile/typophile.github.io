body: "Hey everyone! I thank you in advance.\r\n\r\nI'm  designing a logotype for
  a local jeweler. His previous identity was old english/blackletter typography of
  his name 'Mathew'. After a brief with him, we decided to keep some of the style
  of the logo, in particular, the authoritative/established look and feel that blackletter
  typography represents to him. (trust me I tried to stray away, however without any
  success). Another thing he wanted, since he loves old school art & design, is a
  mixture of what he had with a modern AND retro touch. Quite a hard task.\r\n\r\nSo
  what I'm doing is designing custom letters with a hint of blackletter and retro
  inspiration. Please feel free to rip this up as its the first draft and the first
  time I try to design letters from scratch with such a broad design range.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nJonE.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's <em>almost</em> an ambigram! Perhaps you could tweak it a bit and make
    it a real one :-)

  body: "Yes, perhaps. However I'm always concerned with readability when it comes
    to ambigrams. Actually I'm concerned with the letterforms working as they are
    now...maybe after they are fully completed I can try the ambigram.\r\nIt came
    out this way because I started with the 'a' and designed the other letterforms
    based on the 'a'. Is this the appropriate way to design letters?\r\n\r\nJonE."
