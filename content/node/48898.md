body: Does anyone know where I can find or buy printed corporate identity manuals
  for companies? I'm particularly interested in Paul Rands manual for IBM, and also
  the current BP manual.

    a copy. It might be worth it to contact the company directly and just ask. It
    couldn't hurt.

  body: It would be interesting to know how many corporate identity manuals are compliant
    with their own standards as put forth therein.

  body: "The sad news is that most of those are in landfills or have been recycled.
    As the corporations are going with PDF versions, their staffs and contractors
    are dumping their old printed versions. About the only ones left are in the hands
    of collectors. I know a ton of people that work for International Paper and recently
    tried to get a copy of the old Lester Beall Standards Manual. I waited too long
    to ask because everyone said they dumped theirs when the electronic versions were
    adopted.\r\n\r\nGood hunting to you."

    their sites.\r\n\r\nABB visual identity as an example: \r\nhttp://www.abb.com/visualidentity\r\n\r\nA."

  body: Thank you for your comments, but I am only interested in finding printed copies,
    I know they are rare, but surely someone knows of a resource.
