  enough attention because I've never been in a position to attend. It now looks like
  I may be in such a position so I wanted to ask for some details on others' experiences
  at such events (I know, that's a very general question). I have the web-links for
  each organization to get details on future dates/places, etc., but I'm just curious
  to hear about what these conferences \"look like\" through the eyes of a few Typophiles.
  \r\n\r\nAlso, are there other such conferences I might not know about?"

    design jobs  on the go as well) the thought of putting a presentation together
    is <em>far</em> to much to think about, but these things are a ways off, so who
    knows. I'm serving as one of three judges for this year's Alcuin Awards (Canada's
    national book design competition) and may be giving a short presentation then,
    so perhaps it might be worked into something more substantial. Again, who knows.
    But thanks for the push.\r\n\r\nI'll hope this topic doesn't dry up right away,
    as I'm quite curious to hear about the two biggies and any other conferences that
    a book designer / typographer might venture away from the isolated studio to visit."

    am now on the SoTA board.] I've also attended two ATypI conferences (and gave
    a presentation at one of those).\r\n\r\nJason, the conventional wisdom about the
    two is that TypeCon is more informal, more general, and tends to attract a wider
    spectrum of attendees, from type industry professionals to graphic designers and
    newbies; whereas ATypI is generally held to be more professional, more focused
    on industry-specific interests, and more international in scope and flavor.\r\n\r\nI
    know many colleagues who attend both, each for different reasons (i.e., to satiate
    different needs ;-). I also know some who prefer to attend only one over the other
    (in almost equal measure).\r\n\r\nIn my experience, TypeCon tends to feel more
    social. There's a great blend of type makers and type users, and the atmosphere
    is very conducive to finding yourself in conversation with your biggest idols
    (or greatest fans). It's not unlike the Typophile General Discussions or Design
    forums in real life.\r\n\r\nI have less experience with the ATypI conference,
    but it tends to feel more professional. There's a greater representation of European
    type makers. There are many more presentations and a lot of tough choices. (ATypI
    is multi-track, whereas TypeCon is single track.) ATypI feels a bit more like
    the Typophile Build forum.\r\n\r\nI tend to view TypeCon as a great place to expand
    my type connections, and ATypI as a good place to advance my type career.\r\n\r\n--

    at both of these conferences. (I will say that presentations on these topics tend
    to be more academic in style and approach at ATypI.)\r\n\r\nIf you go to the sites
    of each, you should be able to find archived information about past programs,
    and you may be able to judge for yourself from the descriptions.\r\n\r\nwww.typecon.com

  body: "I attended my first TypeCon this year. With the exception of a panel discussion
    on grunge typography (which seemed to be a rehash of the material of previous
    presenters), I found something of interest in every session. As has been previously
    mentioned, the range of topics and approaches was broad, but I found that appealing.
    Type history, type in pop culture, type design, typographers of the moment (both
    today and in past centuries) -- it really was a rich experience.\r\n\r\nBeing
    a longtime (if not exactly prolific) Typophile participant made it easy to find
    people to talk to. It was fun to walk up to someone whose name I recognized from
    the forums and introduce myself. Of course, I met lots of other folks with whom
    I didn't have any previous connection -- the shared love of type made it simple
    to find common conversational ground."
