  Neue as \"Linotype Staff,\" while Linotype appears to sell some <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/112299/itcofficinabyadobefontfamilygroup-clan.html\">Adobe
  fonts</a>. The PostScript versions of both fonts appear to use the same \"easy-to-use
  numbering system\" in the font names.\r\n\r\nCuriously, the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1198.html\">Adobe
  OpenType</a> version of Helvetica Neue doesn't seem to have numbers in the font
  names, while the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/88565/neuehelveticafamilyvaluepack-compilation.html\">Linotype
  OpenType</a> version does.\r\n\r\nI'm writing a style guide, and I'm trying to figure
  out which of these fonts (if any) are interchangeable. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nIf
  you have any additional insights into differences between the two, or why this confusing
  situation exists, I'd love to know.\r\n\r\nP.S. I originally posted this question
  on <a href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/68665/Helvetica-Neue-Neue-Helvetica\">Ask
  Metafilter</a>, and was advised to ask again here."

  body: Neue Helvetica is the correct name for the remake of the hodge podge version
    of Helvetica. Use the Linotype version for all reference material.

    be more complete than what's on their website.
