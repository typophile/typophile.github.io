  eye. It showed a face named Universium. More info filtered in - it was a hybrid
  of Univers and Gentium.\r\n\r\nThere you have it. It's now all up to you if you
  want to wail and gnash teeth or go ahead and hybridise them."

  body: "I woke up a couple of nights ago after finding a beautiful, leather-bound,
    century-old tome, only to open it and find that it was printed in ITC Garamond.
    I clearly remember examining the letters in disbelief.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting:
    how-tos on lucid dreaming often advise you to use reality checks to find out whether
    or not you're asleep. Books in dreams supposedly don't have any meaningful content,
    or randomly changing text if anything. That obviously doesn't seem to work for
    us :)"

    up from <em>that</em>.
