  you organize different typefaces into folders? Do you type words in that relate

  on setting up a library like this?"

  body: "Without a specimen, a typeface is essentially an idea. Type for print performs
    differently in different environments, and it's nearly impossible to know how
    well it performs, without printed examples. In our digital world, nobody wants
    to spend money on printed specimens. So to choose a font for a book or magazine,
    you have to view them onscreen at a large size, and then somehow infer how the
    fonts will look when printed much smaller on paper. That's an unreasonable leap
    to ask people to make, when they're going to spend money and commit their project
    to a certain typeface. \r\n\r\nSome foundries offer PDF specimens, you could collect
    them and print them out, put them in a binder. But that's limited by your own
    output quality.\r\n\r\nWith printed type specimens, you can \"collect\" your favorites
    without having to buy them, as you've described. Look, enjoy, and become familiar
    with the typeface and what it can do, so that when a good use for it comes along,
    you can be confident in buying it. "

  body: "Jesse,\r\n\r\nYour original post mentions \"collecting typefaces\" which
    sounds like buying type to add to your own type library. I realized you meant
    collecting *samples of typefaces*, not the fonts themselves, but it wasn't clear
    from your first post. Of course, the one can lead to the other, and we encourage
    that.   ; )\r\n\r\nI think Tiff's method of filing by foundry or designer is useful;
    use it for the inspiration samples, and then later when you're building your type
    library, use it again for the actual fonts. You could make up your own classifications;
    text and display, techno, script, etc. etc. There's very little agreement about
    how to classify type, and fortunately, you are free to use whatever method suits
    you on your own machine. \r\n\r\nIt's a great thing to do; collect samples, specimens,
    screenshots, for later reference. I have a folder on my hard drive where I put
    all my downloaded PDF specimens, which I rename with foundry and typeface name,
    if that isn't already obvious. I print specimens for text faces only, on the laser
    printer at work (which in my case is a nice 1200 dpi machine). Those I keep together
    near the other, rarer specimens from the foundries. Display faces are easier to
    understand and assess onscreen, so I leave those in digital form only.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know why there aren't printed specimens available anymore. I consider them
    essential to demonstrating a good typeface. I'm sure most would cite the cost
    of producing them. SInce there are so many micro-foundries, and the economy of
    developing a typeface is so different now, very few can justify the marketing
    expense. Even Adobe, whose Adobe Originals program continues at present, stopped
    printing their amazing specimen books in the 90's. It's a shame, because type
    made for print needs to be shown in print, and without a specimen, graphic and
    book designers are left guessing whether something will work for them. I suspect
    that most designers will not do hours of research or spend resources making their
    own specimens (without the typefaces, how could you?), they will simply revert
    to using the old, tried-and-true faces they've been using since 1989; Times, Adobe
    Garamond, Univers, etc. \r\n\r\nSmall foundries especially have very little budget
    for marketing, and most likely, they have no experience in marketing either. What
    to spend money on? Where are designers looking for new type? It's a puzzle. Larger
    foundries have abandoned most print media for marketing type, so it's all becoming
    sadly virtual. I'm sure the increase in onscreen reading, fed by the internet
    and digital content (news, blogs, e-mail), and the fonts made for screen reading
    (MS ClearType) are factors as well."

    long time now, but as far as I remember this option was given in the light version,
    too -- the difference was, that with the deluxe-Version it's possible to assign
