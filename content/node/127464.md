  the "Fiat Lux" phrase. Anyone have an idea? Thanks in advance!

  body: Sorry about the resolution guys, this was as big as I could find it. The college
    itself is defunct so it has been a chore looking for the seal itself. But I will
    take the suggestions in consideration and hope for the best. At this point I may
    have to "fake it 'til I make it". Thanks everyone!
