  <BR>Woo eee, my first post here. Here&#39;s an alphabet I put together from hand
  painted signage in and around my stomping grounds of Green Bay, WI. Thought you
  type nerds &#40;like me&#41; would enjoy this. <BR> <BR>Inspired by both a collection
  of lettering in Vegas I saw in Veer, and a trip down Route 66, I took last summer.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got some more pix of the signs themselves over at <a href="http://www.bradknapp.com/blog">my
  photoblog</a>. <BR>
