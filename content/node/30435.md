    Heavy</a>, by McGrath &Williams, again in a superficial, structural way, but this
    one could be a closer starting point if you wanted to edit a font to re-create
    the logo.\r\n\r\nI am starting to feel that the Zagle logo is probably custom.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "One more idea for something similar: Trooper Roman, an old VGC typeface,
    digitized as <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm\">Talon</a>
    by FontBank. Note particularly the 'a' and 'g'. This probably has another name
    in the Brendel collection, or Optifonts collection, both noted for un-original
    typefaces not often found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[edit: Brendel (QBF) has it as <a
    href=\"http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm\">Toledo</a> in multiple weights.]\r\n\r\n-

    body: "Mike,\r\nThanks a lot for the research you've done. Zagle magazine was
      launched in 1955 and was based on traditional hand-made design - so the logo
      could be custom job indeed [matching that good, old fashioned imperative].\r\nknap"
