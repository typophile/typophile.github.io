body: "Hi folks, I wanted to know what your thoughts are on using Helvetica Rounded
  for headings, Eurostile Bold for sub headings and Eurostile Standard for body text.
  Does this sound like a reasonable combination to you? I personally think they are
  definetly 2 contrasting styles, but any suggestions would be nice! \r\n\r\nThanks
  Craig\r\n\r\nEDIT - erm 1st post, just read forum suggestions - so to add this is
  for a website, my flash portfolio website. Thanks again for any help."

  body: Just because you're using flash for a website isn't an excuse to use a weird
    font for body copy. Stick with something web friendly like georgia or arial. Flash
    interfaces are usually clunky enough already. Try to keep it simple.

  body: I've always felt that Eurostyle is one of those typefaces that should not
    be used at all. I haven't yet used the rounded, but as for normal Helvetica, on
    screen it tends to jump from it's baseline a little. Unless it's maybe 18pt or
    above, I'd agree with Haley, and say to use Arial (probably the only time i would
    advocate it's use).

    are an assault on the senses; keep it as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nBut at the
    end of the day, it's ultimately your decision - if you think it looks good, do
    it. That's the freedom you have with design, especially for your own personal
    portfolio website."

    following a popular path that works quite well. \r\n\r\nJust take care to try
    and use sizes that look good, \r\nand not too small on the text. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    I know its not to everyone's taste. Here's a small look at what i've done, feel

  body: "There is little correlation between the appearance of a type in print and
    online, especially at text size.\r\n\r\nIf one is familiar with a face in print,
    it would be foolish to assume that knowledge is worth anything on screen. You
    have to see it.\r\nThere are also many ways to \"process\" a type for screen display.\r\n\r\nSo
    \"use Arial/Georgia\" is safe, but I'd say, try your idea and see if it works
    for your readership on their preferred browsers/OS.\r\n\r\n[update]\r\n\r\nOK,
    there is some correlation!\r\nLooks fine to me."

  body: "What is it about young designers that makes them want to have black/dark
    backgrounds?o they not understand how much it reduces the legibility of the text?
    And is that a pattern in the background? Down goes the legibility another few
    notches. \r\n\r\nFinally, while I am a fan of Flash, it is only for its correct
    use. Now that sample may not represent the entire site, but there is nothing there
    that cannot be done better in HTML. If there is no reason to use Flash, don't
    use it. (And I don't consider things moving around mindlessly to be a reason.)
    Work hard to achieve your goals with HTML and CSS, and then, only if needed, move
    to Flash.\r\n\r\nReasons not to use Flash include the impossibilty of someone
    bookmarking a portion of your site, and the probability that your site will be
    completely ignored by search engines."

  body: "\"What is it about young designers that makes them want to have black/dark
    backgrounds?\"\r\n\r\nOn screen, i find it's almost the opposite of print. the
    darker the screen, the less light your eyes are bombarded with. This is especially
    true when it's projected (although a rarer occurrence) A lot of times, flash sites
    are designed with this in mind. I find using black just as legible in this case,
    maybe not the pattern.\r\n\r\nAs to the Helvetica rounded, it seems to be okay
    on-screen in this instance, although its not my favorite typeface, it doesn't
    appear to be doing anything visually weird. I would definitely get rid of the
    euorstile"

  body: "As for white text on black, at least for me, it is virtually illegible on
    my malfunctioning monitor. I can't really do anything about it as I am located
    near a strong radio interference source, and any monitor would be doing the same
    thing here, and moving is impractical. Oddly enough, orange text on a dark gray
    background suppresses the appearance of these distortions.\r\n\r\nBut that's just
    my special case. In general, if you <em>must</em> use reversed out text, it's
    a good idea so step up the weight a notch, i.e.: change your text weight from
    Regular to Medium and Bold to Heavy (if you're using the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/|URW++
    version of Eurostile]])."

    Neue and i've upped the weight.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dark background I also prefer
    dark to white because of the screen glare, but this is a debate which seems to
    rage on!\r\n\r\nThe site is just a one page site, with the main emphasis on my
    work, which constantly scrolls slowly above the text in the sample. I've tried
    to keep it nice, simple and intuitive."

    Helvetica Neue for the rest of the copy with more weight. Any thoughts on this

  body: The leading seems a little generous to me. The helvet is a lot better than
    the eurostile though. How exactly does this appear on the monitor/in browser?
    is the flash site actually the dimension shown, or is it a snippet/resize of the
    full page? The format seems a tad bit short /wide for me.

  body: Based on this snippet, the body text seems way too tiny, given the busy background
    and flash's lack of flexibility.
