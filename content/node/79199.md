  was looking for some free \"Good\" fonts (I think), for a school newspaper or column.
  It was is the last few weeks. One of the free fonts was issued free from a government,
  school or perhaps newspaper. It was a serif font with multi weight and styles. I
  think the site was a UK site or perhaps finnish? I can't remember...\r\nDoes anyone
  know where that thread is, or perhaps know what that font was?"

    I searched for things like \"high school\" \"school paper\" \"school newspaper\"
    \"yearbook\", and that thread never came up (in fact no thread from 2010/2011
    would come up in some searches). Not sure what's up with the search function -
    is it case-sensitive? I can never seem to find anything with it."

  body: Nope - The thread had maybe 6 to 10 links to websites from different people
    of free quality fonts. Been searching a couple hours...

  body: 'Are you sure it was a serif font? Your description reminds me of <a href="http://www.dmjx.dk/international/press/font.html">Aller</a>,
    with many weights, professionally designed by Dalton Maag for the Danish school
    of media. Everything fits, except that Aller is sans serif. '

  body: Yep - serif font. I seem to remember seeing a red bar on the site, along with
    a photo of a tan colored stone building too. Driving me nuts...
