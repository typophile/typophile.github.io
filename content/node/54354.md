  that were made in the Paris 1968 revolution. It is something that mixes handwriting
  letters with \"capital\" letters. There is an image above that will make it clear:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mai683tif_5994.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

  body: "I've seen these May '68 posters before and there isn't really a consistent
    style to it that could be captured in a single font. Unless you're wanting to
    set long stretches of text with something like this---which is not advisable!---it
    would be quite easy to simply draw these kinds of letters as was done in the 60s
    (see image below). In the image you attached, the capitals are just badly drawn
    Helvetica, and the \"cursive\" writing is mostly just random. However, every other
    poster I've seen has a different style. What exactly do you need these kinds of
    letters for?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pourquoi_6475.gif]"
