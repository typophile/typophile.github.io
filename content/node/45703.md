  be found on most of the covers of Haruki Murakami's paperbacks. I am not sure if
  it's a font per se, because some repeated letters just don't match.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "And once again you can see that each letter is unique. Each one of the three
    letter a's is different, for example. Rob Leuschke's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/kolker-brush/|Kolker
    Brush]] shows a lot of similarities to your lettering. Leuschke used to do Hallmark
    card lettering and he continues doing custom lettering. I'm not saying I think
    he did the book titles, but someone with a similar brush style did.\r\n\r\n -

    Rowland]]". She & [[http://www.stephenraw.com/letterforms/|Stephen Raw]] seem
    to be the usual suspects for hand lettering like this on UK book jackets.
