body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI have been developing a squarish sans intended for text
  (e.g. in brochure), for now there is only regular weight, others are still under
  development. I would like to hear your opinions on this before I move on.\r\nDo
  you think this font can differentiate itself from other square sans?  What do you
  like or not like about the letters?\r\nComments and criticism are most welcome.
  Thank you for taking a look at this.\r\n\r\nMarica\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/melor-regular-m_5083.jpg]\r\n"

  body: 'Not bad! First, for differentiation''s sake, I think the name is too close
    to another squarish face: Melior.'

  body: Very nice, very Danish in style. The lc m has a bit too much difference in
    the negative space areas under the arches though.

  body: "@Stephen\r\nOkay, I admit I am bad at names. I really like the name Melor
    and I thought it wouldn't be too similar to Melior. They belong to difference
    categories though. Maybe I would come up with a new one.\r\n\r\n@clauses\r\nDanish
    style? That's interesting. Thanks for pointing that out, I will correct it.\r\n"

    it, experiment with applying it in more places (KVWXYkvwxy) as it may bring some
    of that desired distinction from other faces."

  body: "I think it looks good and you certainly have a good eye for letters.\r\n\r\nBut
    you should know that there is a lot of similar typefaces out there. This type
    of squarish sans seems to be the new \"Meta-syndrome\". A couple of years ago
    everybody was doing their interpretations of Meta. Today we see a lot of squarish
    sans.\r\nBut, hey \u2013 that shouldnt stop you, should it? :)"

  body: "Neat and clean and yes I think different enough to be useful, it's very pleasant.\r\nThe
    bowl on the a needs slight adjustment, the left hand node of the counter is too
    high.\r\nI think the eye of the e needs work too...if you take the segment from
    12 o'clock to 3 o'clock and skew to the left a degree or two, I think that would
    do it.\r\nKk stick out to me, I don't like the horizontal connector.\r\nYour spacing
    is very nice."
