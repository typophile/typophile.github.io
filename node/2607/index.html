		<div class="commentbody">I was a PageMaker user from the earliest Mac version. I tried using version 1.0 to do pages for the <i>Utne Reader</i>. I was obviously crazy. Version 1.x actually stored documents as Mac resource files, a really inadvisable idea, as it turned out. It lead to very fragile document files. I was constantly losing work. Aldus wisely abandoned that approach in 2.0. (Also, it wouldn't have worked on Windows if they hadn't.) <BR> <BR>Some things I remember about PageMaker 1.0: <BR>- No kerning or tracking <BR>- No auto-hyphenation <BR>- You couldn't resize text blocks except by changing the column guidelines and reflowing them <BR>- You couldn't work in spreads (you could preview them, though) <BR>- 16 pages maximum <BR>- No spell-checking <BR>- Auto-leading only <BR>- No font menu (only a dialog box) <BR>- No left and right justified text <BR>- No style sheets <BR>- You had to insert your &quot;key disk&quot; in order to run it <BR>- It was about ten times better than MacPublisher or ReadySetGo! <BR> <BR>I got Quark 1.0 as soon as it was released. On paper it ran circles around PageMaker. It seemed like a dream come true: kerning, auto-hyphenation, run-arounds. In fact, it was a buggy nightmare. My analogy at the time was that PageMaker was a dull but reliable sedan, and Quark was a temperamental sports car that was in the shop most of the time.  <BR> <BR>I ended up switching back to PageMaker for most stuff until Quark 3.0, which finally lived up to its promises and overtook PageMaker as the professional choice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It was released in July 1985. At that time, it was the first program that would not run on the original 128k Mac. You needed the 512k model and two disk drives because the program took up 275k&ndash;most of a 400k floppy&ndash;leaving little room for system files and fonts. You needed the other drive for your document files.  <BR> <BR>Hard drives were not really an option on those early Mac models. (There were a few in the 5-10MB range starting at about $2000.) Things got better by 1986 when 800k floppies and more affordable hard drives started becoming available.  <BR> <BR>Looking back, all that stuff was incredibly expensive compared to today, especially when you take inflation into account. I think I spent $1400 on 2MB of RAM in about 1987. That would be like paying about $2400 for 1GB, about the relative equivalent amount of RAM nowadays.</div>
