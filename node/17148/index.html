1. open the attachment 
2. slap a "speaker banner" of some sort on it 
3. email it back to smith.traci@gmail.com (or put it back on here as a word document)

THE RATIONALE/EXPLANATION... 
so it's the middle of finals week at princeton, and i'm trying to make some speaker name tags for a conference coming up (sounds simple enough, but not for me, because i don't know what i'm doing!) i love good design, and i hate it when things are cheesy. (which makes this EXTRA frustrating...)

so now it's 4 am and i'm getting NOWHERE. i thought i'd put the challenge out to you all. i've seen your work; it's amazing. (i lurk around these message boards all the time) i am quite certain you can do something in 15 minutes that i've been trying to figure out for 4 hours. (i'm not kidding) here's the template, in microsoft word (i know, i know, seriously!) all it needs is some way to designate that the nametag belongs to a speaker, and not an attendee... a banner across the top? the word "speaker" at an angle? i'm not kidding about how easy this should be, i just don't know how to do it, and so i'm having a nervous breakdown. 

i'll pick my favorite one, and speakers all over princeton will be thankful they don't have to wear a hideous nametag for 3 days...

it has to be done by 4pm tomorrow. 

PS, if you want to change the fields for names, that's fine, they just can't move around at all (because the princeton theological seminary logo is in the whitespace...)

i'm hoping this works, or i'm just getting out a sharpie, seriously :)

PS the conference is a conference about human rights, and i'm a student who's not getting paid to do this work (lest you worry that this newbie is trying to use you to do my work...) </div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Traci,

There are a couple of questions I have…
First of which is how many speakers and how much time are you willing to devote afterwards to complete the design (cutting mainly). And although you say the conference is on human rights, is there any specific area that it is geared towards or specific groups speakers that will be talking about different aspects of the topic?

		<div class="commentbody">Matthew, 
The conference is called "Theology, International Law, and Torture: A Conference on Human Rights and Religious Commitment." Most of the attendees have a religious affiliation (Either Jewish, Christian, or Muslim) as do many of the speakers, but some do not. Most of the key note addresses will focus on ethical issues related to torture, but other human rights issues will be addressed. 

Good idea about using different colors, Mike and I would do that, but I was specifically asked to have them contain the word "speaker" in some way.

I've attached two images here below showing how the word "speaker," plus a simple color difference, could do the trick. Obviously, the design is a bit conservative, but you are from Princeton ;-)

it just needs to say SPEAKER on it. i swear! i promise! i love that your design has it at the "most awesome conference in the world" though, because it IS going to be the most aweseome conference in the world if I have anything to say about it :)

Dan_reynolds, I have a query..why would you use small caps for the Ph. D.? Wouldn't you use small caps only is the whole word is in caps, or wouldn't you place the H in small caps as well? Is this is personal preference, or is this the way to do it?

No, probably not. But I always wanted to try it. Robert Bringhurst spells the "G" and the "H" in the Germany corporate abbreviation "GmbH" (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) with Small Caps, which looks really funny to me, since I never see it like that (well, I have some German books from the 50s that do it, too).

Like I said, I've always wanted to try it. But if it were my print job? No, I doubt it.</div>

Then just write SPEAKER on it! Really big; Like this even:

SPEAKER
Johann Wickersdorf
Super-dooper Conference

…would be fine. People will notice. The name itself doesn't have to be too big. People won't read it from more than a yard away anyway. And just their wearing nametags, you two target groups, will be almost notice enough. I mean, how many people walk around Princeton all day wearing badges?

You're almost thinking about this *too hard,* Traci, although—on the other hand—I'm glad that you are thinking about design at all. I wish that everyone would pay this much attention to detail, especially at a place like Princeton.</div>
