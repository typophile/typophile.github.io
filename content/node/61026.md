  body: "My teacher used to tell me to write the complete date information, including
    the year. :D\r\n\r\nI'll set \"music by Johnny Tran\" in bigger size if I were
    you, because it's also the one that attract people to come. And also set the sponsors
    logo smaller, if they don't mind, of course. :D"

  body: "When I read the name of the show, and see the the trippy 70s headline font,
    here's what comes to mind:\r\n<li>Loud, informal, fun.\r\n<li>Celebration of lowbrow,
    pop culture (flipping the bird to highbrow art).\r\n<li>Retro-modern (the future
    as seen through 20th-Century imagination).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the problem:
    It's too damn tasteful. The carefully balanced layout with elegant flourishes
    and double rules undermine the B-movie aesthetic you're (probably) aiming for.\r\n\r\nI'd
    start by throwing out the grid. Make the whole thing more crowded and busy. Be
    more adventurous in your choice of body type(s). Make the 2 photo images bigger,
    and tilt one or both of them. If I were designing this, I'd put \"music by Johnny
    Tran\" in a speech balloon coming out of the alien's mouth, but that's just me.
    (If you do put anything in a speech balloon, <em>don't</em> use Comic Sans!)"

    1950s sci-fi flicks the robot/alien always carried a woman, just to let you know
    that he's 100% man, even in yellow tights. "

    logos.\r\n2. Position the gallery address below the event's time and date.\r\n\r\nBut,
    you're the designer, follow your sense. :D"

  body: "Nice!\r\nSomewhere in the revision, the phrase \"Art Show\" got lost, and
    that's essential information, so you'll need to sneak that back in somewhere. "

    to move the address to the bottom, but its hard to move all that around. But thats
    probably what i should do. "

  body: <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> is a great flick, a classic. I can't
    recall that I've seen the others, but they look like low-budget stinkers.

  body: Regarding your layout question, it doesn't have to be symmetrical. You could
    move the sponsor logos to the left and put the address at the lower right if you
    want.

  body: "This reminds me of the posters we used to make to promote the underground
    concerts in college - not a bad thing at all. \r\n\r\nA couple suggestions: Try
    adding a serrated edge to the end of the tape. This will make them look more scotch
    tape-like.\r\n\r\nRight now, it looks like it says \"The Robots Art Show vs. Aliens.\"
    You'll have to play with that a bit because moving \"Art Show\" and bumping up
    \"vs. Aliens\" will create weird negative space issues."
