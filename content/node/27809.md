  in Sudbury (please keep laughter to a minimum ). Moved here from NB for my wife's
  schooling but are now considering the possibility of relocating to a different city,
  one that offers better employment opportunities in the industry. \r\n\r\nI do mainly
  focus on print design, but some web layout architecture as well. Currently working
  as the sole designer/artistic director for a small company up here and am wondering
  what the prospects are like in places like Ottawa (the first choice), Toronto, or
  several of the other southern cities.\r\n\r\nAny links, recommendations, etc\u2026
  you might know of would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJonathan"

      couldn't resist.\r\n\r\nAccording to the DIAC Design industry study, two thirds
      of all designers in Ontario reside in Toronto. I think that says something.
      Toronto is also the largest design centre in Canada and the third largest in
      North America (after NY and Boston).\r\n\r\nBeing born and raised in Ottawa,
      I can't imagine there being much in the way of exciting design happening there
      - unless you fancy working for the government.\r\n\r\nLuke.\r\n\r\n"

    Typophile is a great networking tool in that you get to know folks in the type
    industry. In fact, that's how I found my job at P22, but as far as i know we're
    not currently hiring.\r\nThe fact that this topic came up today is kind of interesting
    because today i just got an email from someone i met at [[TypeCon]] to join their
    linkedin network (www.linkedin.com). I was surprised at how many type people i
    know or know of are on that site. You may do well to use that site as a networking
    tool and start making connections and sending out feelers there as it is more
    dedicated to networking with people of all different occupations. In any case,
    i think it may be worth your effort. I hope this helps."

  body: I am a graphic designer and type teacher living in Ottawa and have lived here
    for about 15 years now. It's a small town and most of our graphic design graduates
    do find work in and around Ottawa. With several schools churning out grads each
    year and an established graphic design community, there isn't too much new work.
    Still, everyone I know is working and I still get the occasional freelance contract
    so I think that if you are resourceful, you'll always find work. Ottawa certainly
    is a nice place to live, especially if you're outdoorsy.
