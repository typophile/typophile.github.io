  \u2013 when we do PDF-files the print of the PDF looks like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/strangeswitch_5678.png]\r\n\r\nIn
  InDesign, the font chosen is the regular, but notice that the a u r t and s are
  bold. And that the ligature is italic.\r\n\r\nIn the PDF (on screen) everything
  looks good.\r\n\r\nWhen we print from MacOSX preview everything look good.\r\n\r\nBut...
  when we print from Acrobat some letters are randomly replaced by bold or italic
  letters. It looks very strange.\r\n\r\nIn this font there is an old \"Type 1 Unique
  ID number\" taken from the serif version of the font. Could that be the issue?\r\nIt
  is an OTF we are producing.\r\n\r\nAnyone seen this before?\r\n"

  body: "I've had the same thing once with Type 1 fonts way back. Screen appearance
    was fine but on print it regular, smallcaps and italic were randomly mixed. Removing
    conflicting ID's solved the issue. \r\nThere's no need for them now anymore, so
    you might as well completely remove them.\r\n\r\nArtur\r\n\r\nedit: Ofcourse 'conflicting
    ID's' didn't solve the issue, removing them is what solved the issue. :)"

    -- the word Institute - the I always comes out fatter than the rest and looks
    like a different font.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I could come up with the get the
    job out and be able to use it as a \"logo\" was to open it up in Illustrator,
    outline it - and adjust the I so it looked like it should have looked from the
    beginning.\r\n\r\nI know, not much of a solution, but it has saved me a lot of
    grief, since I do a lot of work for these folks."
