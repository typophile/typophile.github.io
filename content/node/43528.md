    what MS is using for Windows Vista, and it's generally considered to be an (I'll
    use a nice term here) homage to Frutiger."

  body: Indeed, Jonathan -- so much so that <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=178895>the
    European Union rejected the trademark application for Segoe</a>, stating that
    the font is as good as identical to Frutiger.
