body: "Here's the story: my sister (from the US, couldn't care less about design)
  and her fiance (from Chile, also couldn't care less about design) are getting married
  in two weeks.  Because *I* care about design, I'm trying to gussy up their bilingual
  wedding program, and thought it would be cool to use a Chilean typeface. \r\n\r\nI
  love Australis (http://www.latinotype.com/espanol/fonts/Australis/index.html), and
  purchased the font on latinotype.com this morning, but haven\u2019t received it
  or any confirmation email (other than the one from PayPal telling me I paid.  I
  emailed the site owner, and haven't yet heard back.  Does anyone know how font purchasing
  typically works on LatinoType?  Do you get an email w/an attachment immediately?
  \ A few days later?\r\n\r\nIf it sounds like I won't get Australis in the next few
  hours, I'll buy another font from somewhere I will definitely be able to download
  it immediately.  Any suggestions?  There's a lot of text in the program, and my
  sister is printing it out on colored card stock (either light blue or light purple),
  so I want it to be more black than scant.  It's a pretty informal program, and a
  pretty informal wedding.  The font certainly doesn't have to be Chilean, but it
  would be nice if it were South American.  My backup non-Latin-American font is probably
  Feijoa, which is fun, inky on the page, and very legible at small sizes.\r\n\r\nThanks,
  Typophiles!"

  body: "You know what would be cool? If at the top you started with a very \"European\"
    font on one side and a very South American font on the other, then as you read
    down the invitation they slowly merge/interpolate and by the time it all reaches
    the bottom you have a nice hybrid.\r\n\r\nOK, back to reality. You might go for
    one of the fathers of the recent revival of South American type design, the seminal
    and award-winning Borges:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pampatype/borges/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    you might not know about this: http://www.letraslatinas.com/\r\nBe careful, it
    can suck you in - you might end up missing the wedding!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    got to stop NOW.  (And I feel European-American guilt for being drawn to \"Colonia\".)\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Borges is gorgeous.  I need to think about whether I can afford it. (I can't,
    it's more than my gift budget!  But I'm still going to think.)"

    OK.  :)

    it could plausibly be appropriate.  Anyways, the bride & groom love the program
    (whew!), and they were going to do it in COURIER if I hadn''t stepped in.  (She''s
    a teacher, he''s an astrophysicist.)  So, thanks all!  '
