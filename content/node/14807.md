body: Working at a newspaper right now, and it's in desperate need of a redesign.
  Any ideas on a good serif font with a lot of styles and weights that looks good
  on newsprint? Downer's "Paperback" is one of my early thoughts. Ideally it would
  be fresh and reasonably new.

  body: It's not terribly new and it's often overlooked, but <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/adobe_lib/080245000.html"
    target="_blank">Poppl Pontifex</a> is classic but slightly edgy, has a reasonably
    large x-height (reads well in small sizes), and has an expert range to go with
    it.

  body: "when i was working at a newspaper and wanted to redesign, I really wanted
    <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/MillerDaily\">Miller Daily</a>. unfortunately,
    my corporation wouldn't spring for the idea, so i left... ;^P\r\nOh, and one thing...
    newspaper readers want their content to be serious, so the typeface should be,
    to quote hrant, \"honest.\" IMO, Paperback, although very gorgeous, is too decorative
    for news usage. i mean i love the design, so much so that i'm looking for an excuse
    to license it, but i think it would just be inappropriate in a news setting."

  body: "That's a great comment about the seriousness of the typeface, Paul. The publication
    in question is an \"Arts & Entertainment\" sort of deal and possibly we could
    get away with a more playful typeface. But we have a sister publication that is
    more conservative and I want a new face for that one too.\r\n\r\nKandal is really
    cool and also is appropriate in that the paper is located in Mark's hometown of
    St. Paul, Minn. I got a PDF specimen of that to add to the stack.\r\n\r\nKeep
    'em coming!"

  body: "That's not a question, that's a book!  :-)\r\nA lot of good suggestions so
    far. But we still need to know at least the basics about the paper and its readership.
    Yes, a newspaper font needs to me more transparent than most, but there are still
    so many choices that narrowing it down based on things like the \"angle\" of the
    newspaper, the age of its readership, etc. actually helps - noting once again
    that Design is largely about constraints.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    needs to be taken out of the realm of the template. Each cover must be designed
    individually, with sufficient leadtime to allow for a good job.\r\n3) I want to
    expand the selection of page templates and provide for more editorial color --
    boxes, lines, and headlines in full color.\r\n4) The headline and body fonts need

    to be instituted to elminate the tracking-together of glyphs and the widows &

    layout is done by the editors -- us production people do photoshopping and ads
