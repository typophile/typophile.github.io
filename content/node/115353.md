body: "Hi all. I'm new to this forum and thought I'd introduce myself as well as post
  a question. I've been involved in lettering for about 40years now through the sign
  industry and as of late been exploring font design. Although I have been drawing
  by hand for all this time I have begun to really enjoy the creative avenues opened
  up with tools like illustrator.\r\n\r\nMy question is...I've recently learned/heard
  that illustrator cs6 and font lab no longer \"co-operate\". Fontlab is a tool I
  would very much like to explore and have seen a couple of short tutorials on it's
  use. Is this in fact true and would love about the experience of others in this
  aspect. Further to this subject is that I own 2 licensed versions of the adobe suites,
  cs6 for mac and cs4 for pc and am trying to decide about which tool to continue
  using.\r\n\r\nThanx in advance"

    from Illustrator 6 into Fontlab Studio 5.

  body: "Bob is right. For a simple export of a letter, or group of letters in an
    eps/ai file etc, open the file in illustrator, select a letter or group of letters,
    copy, and paste into a new AI file. Usually this selection does not fill the page.
    Transform it by resizing so that it fills a good proportion of the page. Copy
    the result to the clipboard. Paste the result into a glyph in Fontlab. Resize
    -- should not be a major change if it filled a page in AI.\r\nAnd edit. Often
    path direction is opposite to Fontlab -- if you are working with ps outlines.
    Close open contours. Edit and you have your result. Hope this is a clear explanation.\r\nDon"

    already bought FontLab Studio, please take a look at Glyphs before you do. It's
    much easier to learn and use, plus the developer is extremely responsive to fixing
    bugs and is quite helpful in other ways too. There are other reasons to look at
    other apps too. 1) Glyphs is cheaper, and 2) FontLab is working on a replacement
    app for FontLab Studio. It's anyone's guess when they'll have it ready for prime
    time despite their ongoing promises that it will be \"soon\".\r\n\r\nOne caveat,
    though. If you do decide to go with Glyphs, don't buy it from the Apple app store.
    Buy it direct from glyphsapp.com. You'll get updates and bug fixes much faster
    that way. You can get a Demo Version here: http://www.glyphsapp.com/get-glyphs"

  body: Fontographer and TypeTool are choices as well - I tried Glyphs and after years
    with Fontographer and FontLab found it not worth the effort to learn a new workflow.
    It seemed OK but .......

  body: "I agree Bob, there is a long and steep learning curve for font making tools.
    I remember my first one, not by name -- pre-Fontographer, which I forget, but
    by the fact that the most effective way to place a point was by enter the locations
    of points as numbers!\r\nDon"

  body: '"Learn Fontlab Fast" by Leslie Cabarga is a good book to start with beyond
    pdf manual. His book "Logo Font and Lettering Bible" also includes a bunch of
    tipt on making fonts from lettering etc( relevant to Fontographer and Fontlab).
    I would also suggest that Scanfont is a useful tool for taking hand lettering
    into Fontlab. A number of online tutorials are also out - just google.'

  body: "Modern Font Editors moves to a browser based solutions, where [[http://www.fontark.net|FontArk]]
    is the pioneer and leading vecrtor type design tool.\r\nYou can export the font
    as OTF file and move to other font editors for advance features.\r\nFontark saves
    a LOT of time spent on the technical side of font design by working on multiple
    glyphs simultaneously, and constructing the basic characters shape with the Skeleton
    feature.\r\nFontark's UI is the simplest (No complex and hidden menus and commands),
    yet it's system is most sophisticate. considering the ability to simply modify
    groups of characters, including the entire character set at once (when suitable)
    Fontark cuts off up to 90% of the repetitive, quite pointless, intersect-copy-paste-fit-merge
    operations, and represent a completely new and enjoyable type design experience.\r\n\r\nStill
    in beta and under development Fontark has some limitations, most of which can
    be fulfilled with other font editors, the rest will be removed quite soon as it's
    being developed pretty fast.\r\n\r\nUsing Fontark is completely free at the moment
    (and won't make you broke when a payment system will be suggested), and demands
    no download/installation what so ever (provided you're equipped with a Chrome/Safari
    browser), you can even test it without signing up... just click the start button,
    no questions asked.\r\n\r\nSupport and guidance are given gladly and on the spot
    as well.\r\n\r\nRecommended warmly."

    the best type is not based on skeletons, so I hope you can support actual outlines

    body: "Thanks hrant. \r\n\r\nWe're well aware to the limitations of skeletons
      when it comes to type design. In fact you can create and design fonts with Fontark
      regardless to the skeleton even now. You can go straight to the Outline layer
      and draw anything you like in any way you like.\r\n\r\nFontark's Skeleton feature
      gives two important and fundamental advantages...1. speed of constructing the
      basis of the characters (by the time you'll scan, trase and refine your hand
      drawn character you can create from scratches several characters including unique
      outline details (depending on the complexity) of those drawn by hand by you,
      and probably enjoy it more). 2. characters connectivity, once you've built up
      your characters skeleton (or make use of an existing template) and connect it
      to the SX system, the whole font comes alive and you can control it in so many
      ways (weights, proportions, caps and soon contrast and much more) it's just
      worth any effort.\r\n\r\nThe Skeleton is the basis for quite a lot, but you're
      not limited to and by it, it won't suit all designers, but used wisely (and
      developed properly on Fontark's side) it can take type design to a completely
      new level.\r\n\r\n"
