  body: It's some cut of Caslon. Can you tell us the age of the sample, which would

    knowing more about the source of the image, and its age would also help.\r\n\r\n-

    looks much like your suggestions.\r\n\r\n@Birdseeding, bowfinpw\u2014the sample
    is taken from a letterpress artist's publication from the 90s. But, I'm not sure
    about any of the specifics of the cut of the type. \r\n\r\nThanks again very much,
    I greatly appreciate your input.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\nBest,"
