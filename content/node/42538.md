  body: "<cite>[[Peter Karow]] of [[URW]] developed [[Ikarus]], a digital format and
    software package to digitize and store type designs. After being shown first as
    a draft at the [[ATypI]]-Congress in Prague 1975 it soon became the leading digital
    type technology.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URW\">Wikipedia
    on URW</a>\r\n\r\nThere was digital type before Ikarus, but that was a major milestone,
    especially for digital type <em>design</em>.\r\n\r\nCheck out this older thread:
    <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/30131\">when is the Digital Age in typography
    believed to have started?</a>\r\n\r\nThere, Tim Ahrens <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/30131#comment-174143\">has
    a point </a> when he claims that the [[Romain du Roi]] was the first design to
    be \u201Cstored\u201D on a numerical basis.\r\nF"

  body: Was the Dr.-Ing. Rudolf Hell GmbH's Digiset the first digital typesetter?
    If I recall, it was released in 1968. I don't know whta typefaces it would have
    used, though.
