  body: ' The dots, for me, are reading as an umlaut. From your description, they
    should read as people, yes? What if you simply put the dots over the u and let
    it read as an umlaut, but in an appropriate place? although, this is the designer
    in me talking, which could be a bad thing. '

  body: ' What about a typeface such as century, which has instead of dots &#62; finials,
    then you can re-design the &#39;ft&#39; lig to work this way.... does this make
    sense? '

  body: ' If the concept of people feeding one another is important, perhaps you pull
    it out of the type altogether and look at other ways to transform &#34;loftus&#34;
    into an ownable logotype, whether through ligatures or another treatment.  <BR>
    <BR>A final logo system might be flexible, allowing the client to use the logotype
    or logo by itself, or  combinations of both to accommodate horizontal and vertical
    applications. <BR> <BR>jb '

  body: ' I did get the idea that they were people &#40;although reading your description
    probably created a motivating context&#41;, but I couldn&#39;t see the feeding
    idea in there. Is it health care for birds?  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously: I think
    you need to make the &#34;f&#34; and &#34;t&#34; more like people - and as a result
    a little less like glyphs - just don&#39;t sacrifice legibility too much. <BR>
    <BR>Another idea: the name sounds like it&#39;s &#34;elevated&#34;; if your client
    wants to amplify that, put some kind of &#34;elevation&#34; in there, like making
    the &#34;ft&#34; rise higher; one nice thing about that is that it would convey
    &#34;our customers are more important than our company itself&#34; &#40;never
    mind that&#39;s unlikely to be what they actually think at all&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: thanks all for the comments. very helpful.  <BR> <BR>when i said feeding,
    i meant like feeding medicine, er a nurse feeding a child cough syrup kinda thing.  <BR>i
    like your idea about elevating the &#34;ft&#34; i will try it. also experimented
    with giving the &#34;l&#34; a tail. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2966.gif"

  body: ' I think it would look better if the tail you added was shorter...for the
    moment I prefer the logo without the tail, that makes the spacing tighter. When
    the &#34;l&#34; does not have the tail, it is close to &#34;o&#34;, as close is
    &#34;s&#34; to &#34;u&#34;, which gives a symmetry to the logo and considering
    the white that &#34;o&#34; and &#34;u&#34; have, the &#34;ft&#34; gets more vivid.
    <BR>I liked the idea of Hrant to elevation &#34;ft&#34;, but I am afraid if then
    the logo would be read &#34;loft us&#34;...which maybe is not bad now I think
    over. '

  body: ' Maybe raise the &#34;ft&#34; and make their bar span the whole horizontal
    &#40;above the xheight&#41;? You know, evoking &#34;Unity&#34;. :-&#41;  Plus
    that would make it more like a logo and less like a plain setting - always a plus
    when you want to justify your fee to the client... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' go back to your first drawing this is quite nice. <BR>you dont have to have
    the &#34;left handle&#34; on the &#34;f&#34; you could move the &#34;f&#34; closer
    to the &#34;o&#34; and make a clean break of the &#34;t&#34; and the &#34;f&#34;
    try also using the reverse block again...maybe with a roof shape. very nice work '
