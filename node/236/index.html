  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone. I would appreciate any critique you have regarding the following logo. <BR>The background: <a href="http://www.ontosoft.de" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ontosoft.de">www.ontosoft.de</a></a> <BR>I did the site and the logo last year. The logo had to represent a lot of concepts for one sign, I believe. The stars are &quot;beginning&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, the swooshes are &quot;ontology&quot; and &quot;software&quot;. Finally this year, the guy is going global and I managed to persuade him, that the old logo is not really *that* nice, though it was my job to do it. :-/ The focus is IT and new technologies; the audience ranges from managers to state institutions to students; ages from 20 to 60; different nationalities, different cultures. We've already had a lot of variants discussed and tried out, but neither seems to work. He is still into swooshes, I am more into typo play. Here is what I have right now. The variant with O-matrix is just there to show you, what I've tried and what was already declined. I thank you for your constructive critisism. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11168.gif" alt=""> <BR>Also, before you start - the variant 1 was not presented yet. Variant 2 was presented yesterday and was marked as &quot;hmm&hellip; nice, I like it&quot;, the variants 3 and 4 are just my personal favourites, though the client hates both of them. <BR>I thank you.</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Nice work, I like the fact that you tried several varying ideas.  Personal favorite would be wordmark no. 4, but I'd like to see where it could go with color and maybe an accompanying symbol. The top right, no. 2, is ok but feels dated a bit and reminds me of an older airline logo, but I can't remember the name&hellip; this already is a bad thing <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  3's Good, if it was for a design related product or service, because it's a definite thinker, but I think it might be too much for the average management member, and probably for some students.  Good job though.  Definitely liking 4 more and more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks a lot, guys. See, the client wants to be traditional, to look older, than he is, but also to have a strong identity. People even say, that they like the old logo (the one on the website), but I personally tend to hate it more and more. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Anyway. I've mailed him the following variants. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11176.gif" alt=""> <BR>Just received his reply: 1a and 2b. Damn! I thought he will never take that wording for real&hellip; He likes the &quot;bolt&quot; theme as well&hellip; Which airline was that, again? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>)</div>

Okay, not 8 hours a day every day, but still. I am fed up with trillion variants I had tried and billions the client has seen. Normally, I present between 3 and 5. At max. This time it was very different. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>Younger people (till 30) tend to like the earlier variant. Somewhat older people (30 to 40) tend to like this very variant. <BR>Proportions are still bothering me a bit.

Perhaps yet another example of better design not winning due to lack of sales ability.
