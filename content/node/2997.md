  body: I think you&#39;re right, Tiffany. I wonder what font it&#39;s pretending
    to be? The italic is very narrow. <BR> <BR>This reminds me of a Scott Kim &#40;I
    think&#41; puzzle in <i>Publish</i> magazine a few years back. He showed samples
    where the Adobe substitute fonts had replaced well-known typefaces. The idea was
    to identify what the missing font was.

    Good one Tiff, you rule! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m getting quite a bit of mileage out of that rant. <BR>Hrant&#39;s
    &#34;impostor&#34; remark was a stroke of genius. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>What if it was supposed to be Eric Gill&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/joanna/" target="_blank"> Joanna</a>?
    <BR>That&#39;s an anorexic italic if I ever saw one.

  body: Tiff, you are the best. And thanks, franz, for the link. According to the
    Word doc my friend sent, this was supposed to be ITC Garamond. The italic was
    an oblique of the Garamond.  <BR> <BR>Weird.
