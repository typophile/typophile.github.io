  body: "More letters from the Lettera 22 manual in the same font\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OlivettiLettera22detail_5263.jpg]\r\nThis
    is a pre-digital typeface based on Doric Italic, a design from Germany originally
    cut by John in Hambury [sic.] in 1892. During the 1960s and 1970s -- the era of
    the Lettera 22 typewriter -- Stephenson Blake called the font _Doric 1 Italic_.
    Amsterdam called it _Old Gothic Bold_. Fonderie Typographique Fran\xE7aise called
    it _Washington_. See font information in Jaspert's _The Encyclopedia of Typefaces
    [1970]_. \r\nThe font was released in the U.S. by American Typefounders Company
    in 1898. Here is the release specimen published by _The Inland Printer_:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DoricItalicATF1898SM_3714.jpg]\r\nMonotype
    says that Derek Italic is \"Thought to have developed from a display face first
    listed in 1890\" A very inadequate explanation of the fact that Derek Italic is
    in fact Doric Italic.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
