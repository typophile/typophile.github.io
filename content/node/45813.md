    for any current reasons?\r\n\r\nI realized now how silly a sans-serif \u017F looks
    and that's probably because I've never seen one in sans before.\r\n\r\nHave you
    ever seen/used \u017F in sans or recently?"

    of course ;)

    17th century.\r\n\r\nI agree with oprion too, I'd love to use thorn but between
    not being terribly recognizable outside of the linguistics  / typography / Icelandic
    community, it goes the way of fraktur or the long s.   I suppose you could print
    a book of Old English poetry and use that along with the \xE6-macron :)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
