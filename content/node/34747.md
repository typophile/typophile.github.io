body: "Our foundry has a family of three fonts generated from Fontlab4 as Opentype.
  Sadly our PC customers have trouble loading them onto their machines. All three
  files copy to the fonts folder no problem, but then one does not appear in Photoshop.
  The fonts work fine on our Macs.\r\n\r\nWhat should we be looking at to resolve
  this? Could there be some sort of clash between the naming/id of the fonts?\r\n\r\nYour
  thoughts are appreciated,\r\nNiels"

    and bold italic. \r\nYou must fit your fonts in this scheme and use the buttons
    \xBBbold\xAB and \xBBitalic\xAB in the FontLab Font Info. You cannot have more
    than one font with the same setting of these buttons.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"
