body: "This logo is for a school project. The logo is for a play called Trying. \r\nBy
  Joanna McClelland Glass\r\nDirected By Richard Seer\r\nThe play is about a 80 year
  old Judge who hires a new 25 year old secretary. They are really different from
  one another and argue a lot, but end up influencing each other in a way that lasts
  a lifetime. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/one_5861.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g2_6132.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T_5023.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trying_4730.jpg]\r\nSo,
  that was pretty much my design process. \r\nThe tree and leaf is supposed to represent
  this 'old and young' theme that's in the play.\r\nThanks guys."

  body: I guess I don't see the style of the type working well with the hand lettering
    you've done. What about hand lettering all of it?
