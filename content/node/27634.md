  printshop; I am presently putting together pictures and thoughts from my misspent
  youth in HTML to go onto a CD for the kids. It may be published eventually if I
  can find a publisher with a taste for the quirky, but I can't see it in any form
  other than electronic: afterthoughts, sidebars, sidebars to the sidebars, essays
  on the draft, etc. live in a nexus of hyperlinks and would be infuriating on paper.\r\n\r\nEvery
  time I mention some object, I find that nobody today, except for a dwindling few,
  knows what I am talking about, so I have been grabbing pictures of admats, transposition
  brackets (I was later a telephone lineman), Paige compositors (always a lit major:
  Mark Twain invested heavily in this just when Ottmar was busy with his invention)
  and the like to explain.\r\n\r\nI should like to use your image of the linotype
  matrix 14919.jpg found on Google Image search (which lists the link as broken) in
  my work. I give good attribution with a link to your site, and I offer a copy of
  my eventual CD, if you would care to have one. Whom do I contact?\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    it looks like it was scanned from a book. Someone here may have an image that
    they could share."
