  a session with him tomorrow at 10 in the morning. I've heard a lot about him and
  thus quite excited to meet him. But really have no idea what to ask him :) Has anyone
  here had a chance to talk or work with him_?\r\n\r\nCheers!!\r\n\r\n"

    professor in Basel, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nSatya, I had the opportunity to spend
    an afternoon with him a few years ago. He has great stories to tell. Personally,
    I'd like to know what he thinks about the new avant garde in Swiss graphic design\u2026
    it is very different from the movement he helped create back in the 1970s. I'm
    talking about teams like Lineto, B\xFCro Destrukt, Optimo, Norm, and all these
    great students making new (but often illegible) grid- and system-based typefaces."

  body: "I found him to be a very good teacher, and visually very perceptive.  He
    was much more open than I thought he would be.  He is also a lot of fun.  Like
    any teacher, learn from him what you can in your short time together but don't
    be afraid to question what he says. He is open to that and the dialogue which
    follows is a very good thing for both of you.\r\nHe is not a type designer, he
    is a skiiled and creative type user who pushes the boundries of visual syntax
    purely with type--and a very limited palette of it.  Think of it like reducing
    the number of variables in a scientific experiment. It is easier to focus on the
    manipulated variables if you control as many of the others as possible.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    choosing their own path. Weingart has spent his life as a teacher and has been
    successful at it with the methods he chose.  Others may be successful teachers
    doing quite the opposite.  That is the beauty of the human mind. It does not have
    to be confined by the opinions of others. There are plenty of things he has done
    which I might look at and say \"that is crazy\". I am still glad he did them,

    amazing teacher and a very generous individual. And he loves being asked questions,
    is alarmed when students exhibit no curiosity, especially curiosity about the
    past, about history. So do pose questions. You could ask about his approach to
    teaching, the years with Armin Hoffman. Also, you could talk about what he sees
    as the difference between laying out by hand as opposed to laying out on a computer,
    about the disappearance of manual work in typography. If you really want to get
    him going, you could ask about his views on grids..."

    couldnt recall this crazy Greek guy's name but yeah he told me that he had a short
    two weeks typography class there. \r\n\r\nLinda, i told him abt you and yeah he
    knows you. he told me to say hi to you :)\r\n\r\nDan, I aslo spoken abt you. He
    said that he went there at Linotype office but i think it was not one which is
    in bad hamburger. where did you met him?\r\n\r\nWhile dinner he asked me that
    how do u I know a lot abt him..as I was the only one who asked maximum questions
    in the session. I told him that am a member of typophile and we've already discussed
    you there. and i think he knows abt this forum.\r\n\r\ni really liked him what
    said in the session. he said we dont need much typefaces now. As he said in his
    book that only four typefaces can address any typographic problem. He discussed
    his book..I asked him abt his round compositions. \r\n\r\nWhen I asked him abt
    his experience with hoffmann and ruder, he showed us a picture taken in NID when
    he, hoffmann and ruder visited NID in early 60s(sorry I couldn't recall the exact
    year of visit). he was around 20 at that time.\r\n\r\nHe made me shut by saying
    that its a different story when i asked what he thinks abt Helvetica. :)\r\n\r\nhe
    discussed hot metal, and he showed some of his works. \r\n\r\nFor now he has no
    plan to write any other book..But i told him that plz make it lighter this time(
    he laughed)..its too heavy to hold;)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC08634_4921.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC08627_4715.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC08624_4082.jpg]"
