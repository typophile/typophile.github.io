body: "I think I recall reading that a font height is determined by the total differrence
  between its ascender and descender values.\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nIf so,
  I still need some help. In the pixel font world, size is frequently of prime concern
  for designers. In fact it is perhaps the most frequent reason a designer might choose
  to go with a pixel font in the first place. There are other reasons, of course,
  but footprint is a biggie.\r\n\r\nSo, there are times when I'd like to offer two
  versions of the same font, sporting the same caps and x heights, but one pixel longer
  (or shorter as the case may be) for the ascenders and descenders. This may or may
  not be a type designer no-no. \r\n\r\nI can easily see the belief that a type designer
  should only ever release the most readable version of a font.\r\n\r\nBut, there
  are some cases where I'd like to leave the decision of balance up to the designer.\r\n\r\nSo,
  a font versioned in this fashion might be named \"Submit Casual Bold 9\", and its
  sibling \"Submit Casual Bold 10\". But doing so seems misleading to me, as I would
  expect to see an all around larger font in the \"10\" version, and of course, not
  get one.\r\n\r\nSo, how should I design my naming convention? Should I call the
  version with the longer ascenders and descenders a \"Book\" version? That would
  be slightly funny, thinking about a pixel font as a book font: )\r\n\r\nStill, I'm
  sort of scratching my head on how to come up with a new, and better naming convention
  for my pixel font  library, as I ready for the relaunch of MT.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  offer any suggestions, or directions I might follow up on?\r\n\r\nTyler\r\n\r\n"

  body: font height is cap height, isn't it? and leading is from cap to cap. hmm.
    or am i over simplifying?

    the terms font height and font size actually two different things? if so, i might
    have phrased my question wrong.\r\n\r\ni'm trying to incorporate each font's size
    into a universal naming convention. different dimensions in ascenders and descenders
    kind of complicates that attempt.\r\n\r\ntyler"

  body: 'No they aren''t too different things. If you are creating a typeface with
    versions containing long ascenders and short ascenders you could simply use a
    letter representing that and still be able to use numbers to reprensent point
    size of the typeface. '
