<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone here knows if there is a digital library with the first issues of ITC "Upper & Lower case"?
I found out [[http://www.itcfonts.com/Ulc/4112/|this site]] but I'm interested in the older issues (started in 1973) published in paper.
I found some pictures on intenet but not very good ones...
Thanks

<div class=commentbody>I have about a dozen or so from ca. 1994&#150;99. I'm not sure what good that will do you, since I don't think I'm ready to part with them ;-). Although . . . they are just sitting in my attic right now.
Part of this was the period when each issue had a completely different guest designer. I also have a few of the Van Bronkhorst&#150;designed issues toward the end. I think I may even have the very last issue published.
Is there anything you're looking for specifically?

<div class=commentbody>I worked as a consultant to U&lc during their change from traditional typesetting to "desktop publishing". I have multiple copies of most of those 1990s issues as well as many of the issues from the 70s and 80s. They are packed away at the moment during our renovation, but once I unpack them I'd be happy to entertain offers to buy them. I'll put together a list of the issues I have and you can let me know if they are of interest.
Unlike Kent I'm quite ready to part with them.

<div class=commentbody>Hi all!
Thanks for the replyes...

I posted on other Post but no one anwser me :-( here what I’ looking specifically:
In the presentation that Mark Simonson made about Adrian Frutiger, (more info [[http://www.marksimonson.com/article/179/frutiger-talk|here]]) at some point he shows a picture of a old magazine/newspaper about typography (Upper and Lower Case I think) that shows an article from Frutiger called “Design and development of one basic typeface into a family of 21 different weights and proportions”.
I would love to read this article.
Since I couldn’t find it on the web I was wonder in anyone here has this article that can share.

Well...If the price is affordable for a Portuguese salary...I can consider in keeping them...
Thanks in advance

This appeared in U&lc. magazine, Vol. 2, No. 1, 1975. It is part of a summary of the proceedings of "The Art of Typeface Design and Visual Communications", a two-day symposium held in Washington, D.C. in October 1974. Other presenters were: John Dreyfus, Aaron Burns, George Sadek, Hermann Zapf, Matthew Carter, Ed Rondthaler, Klaus Schmidt, Lou Silverstein, Thomas Geismar, Rudolph de Harak, Herb Lubalin, Joseph Gastel, Alvin Eisenman, Mike Parker, and David Sutton.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Mark
Thanks for the post.
I really was expecting an complet issue. From what I read and see in your post, the U&lc just posted an news about his presentation. Correct?
I try to find online the proceedings of “The Art of Typeface Design and Visual Communications”, the symposium held in Washington, D.C. in October 1974...but no luck...

<div class=commentbody>You know, ITC would do well to offer a complete set of U&lc. on DVD, like has been done with some other magazines. It's an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the history of type, and what was going on in the world of type from 1970 to 1999 (last printed issue was Fall 1999, as far I know).
The older issues are tabloid size, so it would be awkward and time-consuming to copy an entire issue, at least with the means I have at my disposal.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>If you have duplicates you could always consider donating to TypeCon for the auction.</cite>
Being a great fan of typographic auctions, and being someone who has bid aggressively on items in the past, I have always been disappointed by the Typophile auctions and the true lack of zeal of those doing the bidding. Maybe it the lack of understanding as to the value of what is being offered, or perhaps it is an economic thing.
I remember in San Francisco, Dave Farey found a beautiful copy of "Big Red" in one of the bookstores, and put it up for auction for what he paid for it, and it never even got an opening bid. I wound up paying him what he paid so he wouldn't have to lug it back home to the UK. Now I have two copies of "Big Red"!
So I guess the short answer to your suggestion would be, probably not.</div>

Perhaps I did not make myself lear. When I say "I really was expecting an complet issue" I did not meant the complete journal. I was reffering to a complete article from Adrian Frutiger, you know? Here he explain all the process...bla...bla
