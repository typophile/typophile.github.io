body: "Although I normally steer clear of the bland, overused fonts, there are rare
  times when I have to use them. Now is one of those times.\r\n\r\nI am digitizing
  the archives of a programming-language-standards group. Their meetings were run
  according to Robert's Rules of Order and their documents were meticulously formatted
  and tracked with version numbers, so this project has to rigorously respect the
  history.\r\n\r\nThat means I'm stuck with Times New Roman or a near clone for many
  of these documents. It doesn't mean I'm stuck with bad typography necessarily, though.
  I can make non-substantive typographic changes, like shifting acronyms into small
  caps, introducing old style figures when they're used in the text rather than headers
  or tables, and so on.\r\n\r\nSo here's my question, which I've explored before unsuccessfully:\r\n\r\nWhat
  is the most typographically complete version of Times on the market?\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for text figures, italic text figures, small caps, and italic small caps
  at least (we deal with a lot of acronyms, some in book or document titles).\r\n\r\nThe
  restriction is that I can't use compatible but recognizably different typefaces.
  The glyphs have to recognizably be Times.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: That sounds like Times 827 is what is being discussed. I knew that the Times
    for 4-line mathematics had less slanted italics, and a re-designed lower-case
    v (to reduce confusion with the Greek letter nu) but this comes as a complete
    surprise to me, as well as Times 727 - presumably, the capitals were designed
    with thinner strokes because of the German practice of capitalizing all nouns.

  body: Mike Parker did something similar with his approach to Starling. The Book
    weight has lighter caps to better match the weight of the original lowercase.
    Conversely, the Roman weight has heavier lowercase to match the weight of the
    original caps.

  body: "On Nick's recommendation I picked up Starling and am impressed. It is a surreal
    experience to be able to set text properly in what is essentially Times New Roman
    with text figures, small caps, sloped small caps, and ligatures. Being able to
    tame all the figures and acronyms - some of which are in book titles and so require
    italics - restores the spotty, shouty mess Times New Roman makes of our technical
    documents to some semblance of a calm woven texture. What a relief! Starling has
    solved my typographic problem.\r\n\r\nFour observation on Starling from my casual
    study of it:\r\n\r\nFirst, Starling has another advantage over Times New Roman,
    though I didn't make use of it in this project; Times New Roman only comes in
    two weights, but Starling offers six, which gives the typographer much greater
    control over the text's color on the page.\r\n\r\nSecond, on the flip side, Times
    New Roman has a much more extensive collection of glyphs, including extended Latin,
    Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, and Cyrillic. One does expect a ubiquitous face like TNR
    to support more languages than most. I didn't need those characters for this project,
    but others will.\r\n\r\nI considered whether the two weights of Times New Roman
    might be used to fill in those gaps in Starling. TNR regular weight may or may
    not match Starling book weight closely enough to blend in, and I couldn't tell
    in my skim whether bold TNR is close enough to heavy Starling to match. Even if
    these weights are close enough, the lack of small caps in TNR means this approach
    to supplementing Starling would leave the extended Latin set incomplete, since
    there would be no extended Latin small caps to match TNR's extended Latin upper
    case. Further, the other four weights of Starling would then be left without equivalent
    characters.\r\n\r\nWhile eyeballing the weight in Font Book I noticed that the
    axis of TNR's O and Q don't match Starling; TNR rationalized their axis, even
    though the lower-case letters (most visibly the o) retain a humanist axis that
    doesn't match. There may be other differences as well, but that's enough reason
    alone not to try to use TNR to extend Starling when additional characters are
    needed.\r\n\r\nSo, for projects requiring those additional characters, the ideal
    solution would be to add them to Starling, which would be a significant undertaking.\r\n\r\nThird,
    neither Starling nor TNR has superscript and subscript figures, which is surprising
    considering TNR's widespread use for academic and scientific manuscripts. Calculating
    them as most word-processors do produces results as satisfactory as calculating
    small caps - that is, better than nothing but by no means good.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    both faces include half and quarters as preformed fractions, TNR also includes
    thirds and eighths. Most word-processors can't calculate these at all, so their
    inclusion avoids a choice between using typographically awkward manual fractions
    or modifying the fonts to add them (assuming numerator and denominator figures
    are included to make that a trivial edit). Neither Starling nor TNR includes numerator
    figures 5 through 0 (1 through 4 are included in Starling, 1 through 3 in TNR),
    or any denominator figures, making repairing the fonts difficult.\r\n\r\nIn technical
    work, superscripts, subscripts, and fractions come up a lot, even though most
    fonts provide little support for them. Adding these forty-two characters to each
    of Starling's twenty-four fonts would give it another edge over TNR.\r\n\r\nFourth,
    a helpful but relatively easy change for the font designer to make is adding tabular
    (monospaced) figures (both lining and text). This makes the face better suited
    to financial use, since financial text tables become easier to compose. Neither
    Starling nor TNR includes them yet, despite TNR's widespread use in offices.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    I was surprised by how much typographical support is missing from Times New Roman.
    Although I knew about its basic typographical deficiencies (the modernist exclusion
    of text figures and small caps), I still expected it to have a greater advantage
    over Starling in these other areas, given TNR's huge office-user base and its
    much longer history of active development. Instead, with a little work Starling's
    developers could easily extend it to exceed TNR's numerical support, though meeting
    or exceeding TNR's linguistic support will take more work.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    even without these features, just being able to set most Western European text
    properly makes Starling a huge improvement over Times New Roman."

  body: "And, considering the subject of another thread, Starling even has a circle-P
    character matching its copyright symbol. There also is a character that looks
    like a picture of a sailing boat...\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I noticed on the Font
    Bureau page describing Starling that William Burgess Starling designed it in 1904.
    As that was before Times Roman even existed, I was a bit puzzled; how could it
    be a modified version of Times Roman.\r\n\r\nSo I searched, and found this on
    the web:\r\n\r\nhttp://chutzpah.typepad.com/slow_movement/design/page/2/\r\n\r\nwhich
    seems to go into quite a bit of detail on the story."

  body: "There's one detail that is being overlooked, though.\r\n\r\nTimes Roman does
    strongly resemble Plantin. The Monotype revival of Plantin, however, dates from
    1913, which is also after 1904. Even if Stanley Morison was a \"character\", there's
    no reason to suspect the origin of the Plantin revival.\r\n\r\nThis may not be
    an issue, since Burgess could have used the original Plantin typeface as a source
    of inspiration, of course."
