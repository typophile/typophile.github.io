  I really like.\r\n\r\nThe company is B2B, high tech, makes interactive sales tools
  for Merchandising companies.\r\nMost of these companies in the consumer electronics
  field.\r\n\r\nSo, Ive used Areplos and it really looks fab... now I'd be interested
  in seeing if I could couple it with another face.\r\nPerhaps a face that is just
  a touch less serif....... maybe not.\r\n\r\nIf a complimentary face to Areplos comes
  to mind, let me know... and thx!"

    you're going, you might like Zeppelin? Etelka? John Sans? Sebastian?
