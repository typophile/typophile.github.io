  body: "\"PANADERIA & CONFITERIA\": [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Bodoni+poster/|Bodoni
    Poster]]\r\n\"Distincion\": looks totally custom to me, /i and /t look like they
    could have been created with the right half part of /n, the all thing manually
    slanted. The only possibly original letters could be /c and /o (which looks too
    much slanted comparing to the rest), /D and /s look hand drawn to me. The easiest
    way would probably, if you know the origin of this sample, to ask directly to
    designer in charge of this design."
