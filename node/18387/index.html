  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all.</p>
<p>I am doing some research on the typeface Haas Unica and was wondering if anyone here might have some information on it.</p>
<p>Currently what I have is basic information about Team 77, and the typeface&rsquo;s inception there. Followed by it being digitized by Scangraphic, but not how the rights were acquired or any of that info. Then I get to E+F buying the Scangraphic catalog, but due to legal issues, Haas Unica is no longer distributed.</p>
<p>If anyone can fill in the sketchy details I have above, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So after a little more digging, I have run into a bit of a snag. Two reputable sources have given me conflicting reports.</p>
<p>I originally heard that it was Scangraphic who digitized and released the typeface, and when E+F bought their catalog, E+F ran into some legal problems that have lead to the typeface being discontinued. Then from another source, I have heard that URW digitized it (but never released it) only to have it distributed by The Font Company, with no explanation to why it is no longer available.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the correct story?</p>

I haven&rsquo;t gone to the trouble of figuring out the sordid legal details as
to why this has happened, but I can help you on the typographic front:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can mail you a copy of a uniquely detailed
booklet outlining the development of Unica.</li>
<li>I can put you in touch with Andre Gurtler.</li>
</ol>
<p>BTW Corey, since you&rsquo;re in the area you might be interested in
signing up for my type design class at ArtCenter next semester.

Given the vast amount of typefaces that needed to be digitized in the early 1990s, I kind of doubt that these companies produced two separate digital versions from scratch. It&rsquo;s more likely that the same Ikarus data was used but perhaps converted separately into the Type 1 format.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I called Elsner+Flake to see if I could buy font/get a Licence. They said that it was not available due to a naming copyright issue. (big shame)</p>
<p>I was looking to buy it in the mid 90&rsquo;s but was put off by the (what I thought was an irregular) Cap R. More recently I have rediscovered the font and its power is strong. So much so I decided to redraw Light lowercase for a logotype I am working on. Because I drew up 16 letters, I thought I would go the whole way. This was good as it makes to re-look at the work you have already done.</p>
<p>My feeling is that it embodies &ldquo;form is function&rdquo; absolutly - and this is its beauty.</p>
<p>You can see my effort here:
with a couple of interesting links regarding André Gürtler and rasterizing/beziers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant sent it to me. It is a piece made by Haas to promote their ( then ) new type. I have not seen the original-  just the photocopies. It&rsquo;s maybe 14 pages long ( 7 pages front to back ). The part that I was pleased with was the parts where they detail the changes made &amp; charcterize their thinking. The transparency of that is wonderful. Also, when you look at the Haas Helvitica vs. The Unica the difference is quite something. What would be great is to look at Regular &amp; Neu vs. Unica. But tjis may not be helping&hellip; What kinds of details do you want to know?</div>

You could always contact the foundry in question if you had an idea they had been wronged by the seller - that would be the big thing to do. A middle path might be to ask to extend the license from the legit owners of the IP when &amp; if you needed additional licenses. The policy for extending an existing license might be different than a new purchase. But yes, it&rsquo;s a bit grey.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for hazarding a guess. In my case the digital font&rsquo;s creator, I suspect, was contacted by the creator of the original pre-digital type and the font was taken off the market because of some conflict or misunderstanding. I had used the font in an identity—before it was removed from the market. It was for a friend, and is a rather small business. I’ve been thinking about it though. Not only have I sold an identity and several rounds of printed matter, I could possibly have put my client in a legal situation, and in turn myself in regards to the foundry that digitized and sold the font.</p>
<p>A not so funny turn on the usual font piracy issue. Maybe I should hike my prices on other jobs to compensate for the potential legal liability until the selling foundry clears its legal claim to the face and puts it on the market again. I’m sort of laughing as I type…</p>

<p>The fact that we, on this forum, focus on copyright law in regards to font creation is more of a proximity bias I would suggest. For the group, copyright law in regards to images and written word IS more lightly policed.</p>

<p>Yes of course. What I meant was, the goal is not to steal a font. I would not do it, the goal was to see if there was a way to get the font legally. I don&rsquo;t know what is going on with this font (why it is not available now). I was hoping that maybe it was not a law issue regarding the files, so that i could get it directly from the owners or any reseller (legally).
Of course i don&rsquo;t really need it. Did I say that? It would be just cool to have it. As a swiss graphic designer I must say i has more interest in this font than in a lot of other &ldquo;grotesk&rdquo; fonts on the market now. Even if there is a lot of choice, i think there isn&rsquo;t that many really interesting alternatives to fonts like helvetica (not that i use it that often) that have the same power in the design.

<p>If you were able to read the US Copyright Law, you would discover that the law does not speak of &ldquo;thing for sale&rdquo;, of &ldquo;promotional materials&rdquo;, etc. If your schizophrenic reasoning would reflect the US Copyright Law, then the literary works of non-for-profit (e.g. religious etc.) organisations, which are distributed free of charge, would not be protected by copyright.</p>
<p>Hrant Papazian was the only person at this Typophile site who was able to recognize that offering for download the monograph “From Helvetica to Haas Unica” in its whole without permission by the authors is illegal and constitutes a copyright infringement. Mr. Papazian wrote (see above):</p>

<p>In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:</p>
<pre><code>   1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
   2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
   3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
   4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&quot;

<p>Because this work was a short promotional piece, never made for sale [reason 1] and because its dissemination can only help sell Haas Unica, if it is ever revived [reason 4], and because this posting is not for sale but for educational purposes, there is a solid case for it being &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mr. Berkson:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Uli, have you examined the ’fair use’ doctrine, a part of the US legal code?&quot;</cite></p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>I reread the US copyright Law sections quoted by you (and also checked other legal sources), and I came to the conclusion that Mr. Joe Bauldoff (NOT Mr. Sorkin, of course, as Mr. Sorkin only made the link to Bauldoff&rsquo;s flickr site) committed a copyright infringement.</p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>Mr. Bauldoff, who uploaded the copyrighted monograph, gave the following explanation here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bauldoff/sets/72157604393470536/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bauldoff/sets/72157604393470536/</a></p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;After holding onto this <strong>report</strong> for some time, I feel it should be available to everyone. I am no typographer, but this accomplishment and the methodical thought that went into it fascinates me.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>This is Mr. Joe Bauldoff&rsquo;s excuse for uploading a copyrighted work. Obviously, this excuse is neither criticism, nor comment, nor news reporting, nor teaching, nor scholarship, nor research, as specified by section § 107 of the US Copyright Law, and hence his upload of the copyrighted literary work was no fair use, but an unfair copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Those who downloaded the copyrighted monograph offered by Mr. Bauldoff, made short comments such as these:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Thanks for sharing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for uploading this, Bauldoff.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>Such notes are neither criticism, nor comment, nor news reporting, nor teaching, nor scholarship, etc. etc., and hence such &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; comments do not legalize the illegal upload made by Mr. Bauldoff.</p>
<p>2)</p>
<p>If uploading an entire copyrighted work for download would be fair use, then uploading the Haas Unica font itself for download would be fair use too.</p>
<p>For instance, at a Russian website (I do not mention the link, because Mr. Sorkin would remove it), I have just read:</p>
<p>Question: <cite>&ldquo;Does anyone have Haas Unica? It used to be available from Scangraphic (pre 2004), but it is no longer. Thanks.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>Reply: <cite>&ldquo;Here is Haas Unica (original, 8 weights, Type1)&quot;</cite></p>
<p>The uploader could have added the same explanation, as was given by Mr. Bauldoff, after replacing the word &ldquo;report&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;font&rdquo;:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;After holding onto this <strong>font</strong> for some time, I feel it should be available to everyone. I am no typographer, but this accomplishment and the methodical thought that went into it fascinates me.&quot;</cite></p>

<p>Uli, if you want to ask the owners if they think it&rsquo;s &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; or not to share images of what is an advertisement - go ahead. I would be interested in their take. It is possible that Hrant&rsquo;s idea about it is right. Maybe I am missing something. But in the meantime look into &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;. Admittedly it is something which is still quite fuzzy legally speaking and may take some time to understand. But as Bill points out it really does seem to cover this instance very very well.</p>
<p>Also, please look up “schizophrenic”. The popular use of the word to mean &ldquo;of two or more minds or personalities&rdquo; is misleading. Further using it as an Epithet is also marginalizing for people who suffer from it and doesn&rsquo;t help people to understand the illness or to treat it properly.</p>

<p>Long before the Unica document appeared on Flickr, I had been trying to think of any possible party or individual that I would harm by this display. It is SUCH a beautiful reference to the meticulous care and thought behind the development of this type. To me, it is too lush an educational/inspirational resource to hoard to myself. I come from a long line of hoarders, so this was a big deal for me.</p>
<p>I will, of course, remove the document if any relevant legal body says the word, or if I discover someone that I AM presently harming by this. That is very much a concern of mine.</p>
<p>I do have to commend you, Uli, on your rabid advocacy. Perhaps it is naive, but I do find a sizable difference between making this near-thirty-year-old extinct document readable for the internet community, versus setting up a download of the potentially-commercially-viable Unica font files. If I discover ANY applicable individuals that I am harming by doing what I am doing, I will most CERTAINLY remove the display.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be a dirty pirate to get the attention I never got in junior high. I don&rsquo;t want &ldquo;atta-boy&rdquo; credit for this. My intentions are of the purest. I just want type lovers to have the chance to breathe in the mastery and impressively shrewd attention that went into this imprisoned face. This was to be a sort-of Helvetica 2, and that feat just BEGS to be recognized&hellip; ESPECIALLY in light of Unica&rsquo;s hibernation.</p>
<p>Thanks to all for your support.</p>

<p>I reread the topic about haas unica and it confirmed what i was afraid: the font is <strong>apparently</strong> unavailable because of some stupid legal issues regarding to who has the name now after some business blabla. I know this is how things works in that business, but that really sucks regarding the users. This shows, IMHO, the problems of copyrights and ownership at some level. Unless it is the strong desire from the designers team or the original owners to not make it available now, there is no good reason to keep that font on the shelves, it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Anyway, i found that pdf about André Gürtler&rsquo;s work, with some bad quality scans but also some vectors, with some letters of the Haas Unica (what a marvelous a). I hope it is okay to make it available here, or i&rsquo;ll edit the message: [[http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Guertler/AGuertler.pdf]]</p>
<p>I hope this message doesn&rsquo;t look to aggressive. It&rsquo;s just disappointment about a situation i can&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>This would be futile, since other internet users grapped the copyrighted monograph uploaded by Mr. Bauldoff and have already made it available for download at other websites. And e.g. a certain Mr. Philip Sterne now offers the copyrighted monograph as a PDF file made on the basis of Mr. Bauldoff&rsquo;s scans. See here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/pjs67/FromHelveticaToHaasUnica.pdf">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/pjs67/FromHelveticaToHaasUnica.pdf</a></p>

<p><cite>&ldquo;Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile&hellip;&quot;</cite></p>
<p>(&ldquo;Once it has been sent flying out, it cannot be called back&rdquo;)</p>
<p>is particularly true for those who upload copyrighted works to the internet without permission by the authors of these works.</p>
<p>For instance, in this way, by uploading to the internet, the huge font collections, e.g. Linotype&rsquo;s Gold Edition, Adobe&rsquo;s Font Folio, Scangraphic&rsquo;s rip-off collection (including the Haas Unica font), etc. etc., are now available to everyone for free download, in the very same way as the Hass Unica monograph uploaded by Mr. Baulhoff: <cite>&ldquo;Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile&hellip;&quot;</cite></p>

To my eye they&rsquo;ve given the G an overbite, but otherwise they look like thoughtful edits. Like you, I think a closer comparison to Univers would be interesting. Do you think the name Unica was intended to evoke UNIvers?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When people have spoken to me about it they generally refer to it as a Hybrid between Helvetica and Frutiger. Or maybe I am misrecalling. But in either event, the idea that it a Frutiger-like letter is maybe providing inspiration has been said before. I do love how much better it sets massed on the page. And i love that you can go through and consider what might be helping with that. It&rsquo;s always possible they left something out in the provided list. Or that the change listed isn&rsquo;t helping that much or is a kind of indifferent change, so stay critical. But in general I am grateful that they made such a lovely and useful promotional document. Although it seems obvious to me that it is clearly better in massed text, I am not sure that Haas Unica would be better in display.</p>
<p>The other thing is that I wonder if anybody ever made optical-size specific shapes in the Metal days for Helvetica. I have an idea that That Haas Unica had no such thing because I think they would have had film based typesetting in mind. Haas Unica is listed as releasing in 1980. Adobe Postscript is introduce in 1984.</p>

<p>I am one of very few to be lucky to purchase on time from Fontshop in Berlin Haas Unica. I was in 2000. Since mid 80; I was using it in my corporate designs, ID etc. When I&rsquo;d heard about Mac version I immediately bought Unica. My Swiss typography teacher from Zurich Mr Paul Buhlmann recommended me Unica as a mix of Universe and Helvetica elements. I have never came across of any designer using Unica. Yes it was Team 77. Note: Unica is not in sale anymore.</p>

<p>hernan</blockquote></p>
<p>Scangraphic&rsquo;s SH was letter-spaced tightly (like Hernan says &ldquo;really close&rdquo;, it is indeed really close; a bit too much for today&rsquo;s taste). Apart from this letter-spacing difference, the SB bears those little notches/adjustment (खाचाखळगा)&hellip; I&rsquo;m forgetting what they&rsquo;re called in English&hellip; ink-traps ??</p>
