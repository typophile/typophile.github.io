body: I&#39;m doing a logo for myself.  I like the idea of the A and S combining to
  form one solid logo. <BR> <BR>I basically do cartooning and illustrations, along
  with basic graphic design.  I feel like there&#39;s something missing.  I created
  this logo with custom strokes.  Please any suggestions with fonts or anything.  Thanks.

  body: The &#34;A&#34; is harder to see. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty. Just know that
    -to me at least- it seems most like a slaughtered star. Making it not red would
    move it away from that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Hi Greg, <BR> <BR>I clearly see the &#34;A&#34;, but narrowing the upper &#34;S&#34;
    curve - so that it no longer crosses the &#34;A&#34; - <i>could</i> make the &#34;A&#34;
    even easier to recognize. &#40;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good idea.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I guess you made the upper &#34;S&#34; curve flat on top to get a straight
    &#34;A&#34; cross bar. A slightly more curved upper &#34;S&#34; I <i>might</i>
    like more, though. <BR> <BR>hhp isn&#39;t so wrong when he&#39;s reminded of blood
    smeared on a wall. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure whether I like the grey shadow. The
    logo looks handwritten and the 3D shadow <i>maybe</i> doesn&#39;t fit in this
    idea. It makes the stroke ends quite frayed, too.  <BR> <BR>jpg

  body: 'Hi Greg. <BR> <BR>You have a fine idea working. However, this logo looks
    like it was done in illustrator version 8&#43; with one of the standard brush
    effects. I&#39;d suggest doing it with an actual brush. Do 100 different versions.
    Not happy? Do a hundred more. Bing Bing Bing. Rip them out. Then pick the best
    one. Try different papers/surfaces. You might be so happy with the personality
    of the new mark, that it can live without a drop shadow. <BR> <BR>As a general
    rule: computer effects meant to simulate the real thing are seldom as nice as
    the thing itself. If you want a photocopied look, use a photocopier. If you want
    a brushed look, use a brush. Don&#39;t let the computer limit you. Go for it!
