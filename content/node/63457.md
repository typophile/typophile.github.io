body: I am hoping one of you expert identifiers can help me with this one. The double-image
  looks like a dropshadow. It looks like a block extra condensed but the middle placement
  of the crossbar of the "t" has me stumped. Does anyone recognize this one? As always,
  any help appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mental_5667.jpg]
