		<div class="commentbody">I know what are you saying&hellip; but it sounds then like some East European artist(s) who did this monument are political active and they used &ldquo;K&rdquo; for sake of showing their political attitudes. I mean, how can you tell by lettter &ldquo;K&rdquo; if someone is communist, liberal, democrat or anarchist? That just doesn&rsquo;t make a sense. Only thing that&rsquo;s tricky here is letter &ldquo;K&rdquo; which isn&rsquo;t Western&rsquo;s &ldquo;K&rdquo; and probably one who made this monument or those letters is/are just typographically uneducated or they used this &ldquo;K&rdquo; because Nikola Tesla was a Serb, from East Europe, from Serbia and it reminds them on for example Russian letters&hellip;. I wanna say&hellip; &ldquo;K&rdquo; would pretty abstract symbol for showing political attitude.</div>

And to be honest by everything said so far in this topic, I&rsquo;m glad that &ldquo;K&rdquo; went through monument :) Even it&rsquo;s an abstract symbol representing his legacy and home land.</p>
<p>About &ldquo;K&rdquo;&hellip; either those who made Tesla&rsquo;s monument used &ldquo;K&rdquo; accidentally, either they used it with purpose. A lot of artists like to implement something small and provocative into their works (either for clients, either for personal projects), so everything is possible in Tesla&rsquo;s keys :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just wanted to say, that the detail used in Tesla&rsquo;s name, has been probably intended as a &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of the honoured person against the &ldquo;misuse&rdquo;. The small community wants to emphasize its cultural &ldquo;separateness in memory&rdquo;. This is what I call politics.</p>
<p>Offtopic, but anyway linked: Kościuszko&rsquo;s Monument in Chicago shows Polish hero of American Revolution sitting on the horse with his legs outstretched. That&rsquo;s the way of horse riding called the spanish school, while our riders sat on a horse on the bent legs. It&rsquo;s not a matter of philately difference. It&rsquo;s British and Prussian officers, general&rsquo;s opponents, who used to ride horses spanish way! So his rigid pose on the monument isn&rsquo;t anyway a portrait of victorious volunteer, but of an imperial general - with all implications.</p>

Tesla was a character, with a mysterious, exotic reputation, to put it mildly.
He theorized energy beams (much prior to lasers), the stuff of sci-fi.</p>

dezcom: &ldquo;Why would anyone want to &lsquo;remove it&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>-&gt; and, more importantly, who did?</p>
<p>dušan, without going off on a tangent (too) much, of course there are countries where you have to denounce your former citizenship if you want to become a citizen of said country (germany comes to mind).</p>
<p>citizenship and ethnicity or ethnic heritage are two different things, just take a look at the u.s., great britain or france, if you wish. you seem to think that the two are mutually exclusive, but i don&rsquo;t see why they would be.</p>
<p>as to the question of nationalism &hellip; i don&rsquo;t see the association here at all &ndash; because he was a serb? an intriguing point however, as it shows the conditioning that has taken place over the past two decades, for whatever reasons &hellip; my correction was related to his <strong>place of birth</strong>, nothing else. all the following interpretations are yours.</p>
<p>just my 2 yen. and i am now focusing on type again. :)</p>

That&rsquo;s just one sensitive question about his citizenship for Serb - is (was) he a Serb or Croatian. Probably, speaking reasonable, there are not countries in the world who wouldn&rsquo;t love to say that Tesla was their scientist, so that&rsquo;s why I said &ldquo;to remove it&rdquo; in last post.</p>
<p>@ don dada: You can&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say, cause you&rsquo;re not from this part of the world and it&rsquo;s not the same for you as Japanese (from your profile) and me as a Serb to talk about this topic, since we here think about Tesla as one of the greatest Serb, not just scientist, in our wild history, he&rsquo;s one of the brightness person and the rest of the world thinks as one of the greatest scientist etc etc etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Let us thanks to Tesla for giving us a el. power and chance to make typefaces in electrical form :)</p>

But on some level, from reasons too complicated to explain, he is located in Polish literature and remembered in Ukraine. As an English writer.</p>
<p>The same with Tesla. &ldquo;Our wild history&rdquo; demands us to remember that he was a Serb from Smijan. There&rsquo;s no hagiography without biography. And more - let people from Smijan (whoever they are now) have the hope, that whatever happened once, can happen again there.</p>
