  Its for a clients brochure  and they make furniture. They preferably would like
  a sans serif...\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback."

    place if I were you.

    (preferably in the condensed version) is a reasonable solution.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if you could get your hands on some old books from \"Severin und Siedler Verlag\"
    designed by Otl Aicher solely using Times, you'll see, that this much-maligned
    typeface doesn't even need a complementing sans, but is strong enough to support
    a remarkable, fresh and modern design on its own."

  body: "I used to work at a company that spec'ed Times New Roman and Helvetica Neue
    Condensed (in a variety of weights). I think the message here for choosing a compliment
    to Times is: go for strong visual contrast and an equally ubiquitous typeface.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    your client's style is more important than our snipes at their type peccadilloes.
    Is it mid-century modern furniture? Colonial? Suburban McMansion Faux Neoclassical
    Victorian Mash-up? TNR is such a non-character for so many viewers, you could
    probably pair it with any number of sturdy sans, as long as TNR remains at a text
    size."
