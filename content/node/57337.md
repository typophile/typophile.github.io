body: "There's this British band called Travis that uses this interesting sans-serif
  font. The \"A\" & \"V\" tend to bend into one another. And the \"T\"/\"H\" interact
  interestingly as well. I'm not sure if they're just using an italicized version
  or not, but I'd really like to identify what font it is that they use. Here's a
  few links to google images:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.galeon.com/allmusic/caratulas/t/Travis-The_Invisible_Band-Frontal.jpg\r\nhttp://images.coveralia.com/audio/t/Travis-The_Man_Who-Frontal.jpg\r\n\r\nI'd
  really appreciate the help identifying the font.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
