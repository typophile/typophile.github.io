  body: I think this might be custom. There are some similarities in [[http://www.linotype.com/1047/linotypegneisenauette-family.html?PHPSESSID=6f39a3cad09a37ed8f0d2d997f355a63&subviewmode=FONTS&samplestr=European|Linotype
    Gneisenauette]] and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/red_rooster/jeeves_ot/?utm_source=NewsletterJuly21&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Jeeves&utm_term=em&utm_campaign=DigestJuly10a&affId=98219|Jeeves]],
    but they're both far from this.
