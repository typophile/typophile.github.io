  I went away and studied every aspect of this font to see why it didn't seem to work.
  \r\n\r\nI realised that the weight of vertical and horizontal strokes weren't visually
  in harmony. This was due to the height of the vertical strokes. I rectified this
  by reducing the thickness of the horizontal strokes by a third.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7xjs9vrprbqlke6/STROKES.pdf\">strokes.pdf</a>
  - As you can see the top and bottom stroke of the body of the 'Q' are slightly thinner.\r\n\r\nThe
  thinning of strokes also helped to make the curves feel more natural. Because of
  this the thinner strokes gave the letter forms more white space. In turn the perfect
  circles that previously made up counters and white space turned into ovals.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/meh1pnr8a37b7vm/OVAL.pdf\">ovals.pdf</a> - The
  straight and curved strokes are less noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe width of certain letter
  forms where complicating the overall feel of the uppercase so I split some of the
  letters into sections, each section with a specific body width. 'E', 'F', 'L', 'T'
  and the 'Z' hold a lot of white space so I decided on reducing their width so they
  sat comfortably with other wider letters. 'B', 'K' and 'R' where slightly wider
  to compensate for the lower counters or white space so they didn't feel too top
  heavy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/atqq1q623hc5pax/GROUPS.pdf\">groups.pdf</a>
  - They now sit more comfortable with each other now.\r\n\r\nLastly stroke edges
  have been made to feel softer with barely any sharp points in site. This was achieved
  by rounding off most of the sharp points.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0etyiu21h6q5hq/FONT.pdf\">desperation.pdf</a>
  - The overall UPPERCASE of desperation.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you all think?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks\r\n\r\nDarren Reay"

  body: "It's better. I still think the inconsistency between horizontal stroke width
    (see the E and F) is distracting, and the curve of the S has a number of issues
    and seems incomplete.\r\n\r\nThere are some very nice ideas here, however, and
    I'm a sucker for this type of period work."

    body: "Hi jlt\r\n\r\nReally sorry for late reply, been busy doing other projects
      over the past few weeks for a bit of a break away from this typeface. I've now
      started picking it back up and playing around with it again. I appreciate your
      reply :).\r\n\r\nI agree about the strokes on both EF, the contrast in weight
      are too much, I think I was being too strict with the grids. The S is definitely
      unfinishes and needs more work on it. \r\n\r\nI've recently started creating
      the lower case and finding it hard to contain the same character as the UPPERCASE
      but I'll post the progress over the next few weeks. \r\n\r\n"
