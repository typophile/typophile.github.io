  lovely stamp, but I'm wondering whether \"USA\" is actually a different typeface
  from the rest of the stamp. I have my theories, but I thought I'd turn it into grist
  for the typophile mill.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Frilled-Dogwinkle-Stamp-1985-22-cents_3890.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think? One font or two, and which one(s)?"

    I can't decide which one - this /S is very unique..."

  body: "Kudos on the Galliard ID!\r\n\r\nAs for the \"USA\" part, yes, the S threw
    me, especially the angle and length of the lower serif. I couldn't find a Garamond
    that contained it, and the ones that were close didn't contain that A.\r\n\r\nBut
    of course that's because it's Galliard, too. The stamp has only one face. Galliard
    in metal looks a little different than the modern digital Galliard, especially
    because of the slight ink bleed and impression of real type, but if you take that
    into account the proportions of the S match, as does the peak of the A.\r\n\r\nI
    had thought it was maybe Plantin for most of it and some kind of Garamond for
    the \"USA\", but thanks to your correction I can see now that it's all Galliard."
