<p>Look at the flow from the bows of n, m, h into the right stem!
Also the diagonals of k, v, w, x would benefit from some tapering like it is visible in the horizontals of z. (It seems that there’s a bit of it in the y.)
And could you try something else with the dots than pure circles? Have a look at your terminals of a, c and s!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks a lot for some very useful feedback!</p>
<p><em>Look at the flow from the bows of n, m, h into the right stem!</em>
Yes. I&rsquo;ll try to improve on that. It&rsquo;s definitely a weak spot.</p>
<p><em>Also the diagonals of k, v, w, x would benefit from some tapering like it is visible in the horizontals of z. (It seems that there’s a bit of it in the y.)</em>
There already is tapering in k v w x  y, though perhaps not enough for it to be clearly noticable. I&rsquo;ll try to improve that too.</p>
<p><em>And could you try something else with the dots than pure circles?</em>
I could, but I won&rsquo;t. As far as I know tittles are an often discussed issue, which signifies it&rsquo;s relation to personal preference. I tried several different kinds of tittles, but I chose the cleanest, simplest ones.</p>
<p><em>Have a look at your terminals of a, c and s!</em>
I can assure you I have had a look at them more than once, but they don&rsquo;t look &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; to me. They are based on the terminals in Sensato A (visible in the sans-serif secion on typophile). Do you have a more concrete suggestion about what to do with the terminals?</p>

<p><em>the middle vert. stem is a bit like a shoulder of the n.</em>
What should it be than? Do you mean it has the same mistake in it as the shoulder of n (in which case you&rsquo;re right. fixed in update 1), or is there something else?</p>
<p>@Trevor: I actually thought they were circular, but you&rsquo;re right. There not. This is also fixed in update 1. I want my tittles to look perfectly circular!</p>
<p>@Juergen: I don&rsquo;t know what went on in my head when I made the original n, but I think it&rsquo;s fixed in update 1. Let me know if it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as much work as it may seem. Where I would normally design 6 styles (regular, light, black +italics) I will now have to do that twice (12 styles total) and interpolation does all the rest. The complete Sensato family (Sensato Serif not included) will have 5 grades, with ±18 styles (6 weights, + italics + smallcaps). That means I get a typefamily of 90 styles, while I have only designed 12. Now that&rsquo;s the power of multiple master!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not giving myself a deadline, but I feel like this could be done within one or two (probably two) years from now. In the past I&rsquo;ve proven to be able to work that long on one type-family. It&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering a little bit about the /f/. There may be a danger with this type style of it looking horizontally stretched, which of course you&rsquo;re largely avoiding admirably, but my gut instinct (I&rsquo;m a sometime newspaper designer and see fairly much badly stretched type) was that when I first glanced at the /f/ it felt just that, horizontally stretched. Unbalanced, that is, in horizontal to vertical proportion. I realise with the large x-height it may be difficult to get the f feeling less squatted, but would it break the style completely to have the ascender curve further away?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Jasper, Looking pretty good. I would pay particular attention to the internal spaces (white) and ask yourself whether you would use curves like these if they were external curves? Some of them are very parabolic.</p>
<p>The bowl on the /a/ could be marginally deeper.</p>
<p>/d/ and /u/ foot/stem not consistent with the rest. Any reason why they are different from the same parts of /m/, /n/, /r/?</p>
<p>Tail of the /e/ rather long. Does it need to reach &lsquo;all the way&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Terminals still bothering me. They are clunky, and the higher the grade, the more clunky they look. Can they be more consistent with the /r/?</p>
<p>The bend on the tail of the /y/ still looks to sharp, especially in this grade.</p>
<p>The period looks a little large.</p>
<p>Not sure about the thin ends of the /k/ and /x/ being horizontal. If you are giving the ends of the /v/, /w/ and /y/ an angle then surely the /k/ and the /x/ should have more of an angle logically (or at least the same)? Isn&rsquo;t the point that you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of sharp angles?</p>
<p>Agree with Johan, /f/ is a bit weak at the moment. Agree it could have a larger sweep to the right.</p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oops. My latest comment was directed at Birdseeding.</p>
<p>@Nick: I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean with parabloc curves. I think you mean the inside curves in a d b c etc. look too &lsquo;steep&rsquo;, right? If you look at other high-contrast typefaces (eg. Didot) you&rsquo;ll notice they have a similar curve on the inside. I will try to make the curves a little smoother though, but this means I&rsquo;ll probably also have to make them a bit more square (extreme).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about a, I&rsquo;ll work on that.</p>
<p>d and u foots are different from the rest because they point down, while &lsquo;the rest&rsquo; points up. I tried to make them the way I made &lsquo;the rest&rsquo;, but it just doesn&rsquo;t look good. Hence the small inconsistencie. Nota, by Typonine, has a similar construction.</p>
<p>The tail of e is based on the tail of e in Sensato A. I&rsquo;ll have another look at the e in both Sensato A and E.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t do much about the terminals. The terminal of r has a much easier angle and more horizontal space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to improve on the y</p>
<p>I noticed the period is slightly large, but decided to leave that untill I&rsquo;m satisfied with the lowercase.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll change k and x.</p>
<p>Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t understand Johan correctly. It seemd to me as if he suggested to compress the very top (not the terminal, but the part before that) towards the right. I will try your suggestion Nick, though I&rsquo;m quite fond of this f.</p>
<p>Great feedback! Working on it.</p>
<p>I can also announce that Expletus Sans is finally released, for free! Check the release section for more.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Jasper. That&rsquo;s looking nice.</p>
<p>I think you have some consistency conflict to resolve around the upper counters of the /B/ and /R/. If you like what the /B/ does, make the /R/ do a similar thing. On the /B/ and /R/ topic, you will not need as much overshoot to the tops (and bottom of the /B/) as in, for example, the /O/.</p>
<p>The terminals are better but I would love to see them come to a point rather than be clipped. I know you said you tried it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if they were slightly deeper and the curve into them was less parabolic (squarer?) from the upper internal extremum towards the terminal itself. In this regard, I think the /r/ and /y/ terminals are strong and confident, the terminals in /a/, /c/, /s/ etc. still don&rsquo;t appear resolved or harmonious with the rest of the design.</p>
<p>Second stroke of the /M/ (top left to bottom middle) looks thinner at top than at the bottom. Because it&rsquo;s a central stroke you can get away with parallel contours here, roughly speaking.</p>
<p>Compare the top left of the /M/ to the top left of the /N/. I&rsquo;d suggest the /N/ is too thick on the uppermost horizontal contour. You may want to slant the second stroke less making the top look more like the /N/. Bottom middle of /M/ could also be less wide at the cut (on the baseline).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll change the middle strokes in M and review the relation between M and N.</p>
<p>Thanks Nick!</p>

<p>Blue - to the point
Red - less parabolic, fuller curve.
Magenta - coarser grade (lower contrast)</p>

<p>I must admit I&rsquo;m leaning towards the first. After I&rsquo;ve settled on one of the above I&rsquo;ll upload a picture with small variations within that terminal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The l does look thicker than the other letters, but that could also be the result of the lack of contrast within the l. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do about it. I really dont want this to become an optima look-a-like, bit it&rsquo;s hard to make a high contrast sans look natural without the contrast within stems.

<p>That, or make the letter very slightly more super-ellipsoidal. I think the thickness may be thick enough but it doesn&rsquo;t stay thick for long enough through the curved strokes.</p>
<p>The latest terminal is fine in the E grade but I think it&rsquo;s going to cause trouble at the A grade end. And of course, it&rsquo;s your call to make. I think it could go more toward no.1 and as you already know I&rsquo;m not averse to no.2.</p>
<p>No.1 is lush. Plus, do anything Nick C. says! (Or have a look at his lovely fonts, and then do anything he says.) When he says &lsquo;definitely&rsquo;, he&rsquo;s not playing games.</p>
<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s nowhere near Optima, nor does it need to be. We&rsquo;ll tell you if it goes that way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I made all stems (not bowls) in the lowercase 4 units thinner. Does it look better now?
After a short break, I have decided on terminal nr. 1 with some minor tweaking.</p>
<p>I have already had a look at Nick&rsquo;s G-type Collection many times and they&rsquo;re beautiful indeed. It&rsquo;s great to get feedback from such a great typedesigner!</p>
<p>I think all terminals above will work fine with interpolation. It&rsquo;s still the same kind of structure.</p>
<p>I mentioned Optima, because I use it as a reference constantly because of it&rsquo;s excellence in design, but I don&rsquo;t like the style of it.</p>

<p>The thinner stems are better. The s still looks a bit light. The ear of the r could be heavier. The bottom terminals of the c and e look a bit weak - bring the inner curve up a bit to give a bit more weight. Overall it&rsquo;s very good - and better than Optima, I don&rsquo;t care for it either - especially those horribly exaggerated cupped stems.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really should have been working on the italics of Sensato A, but I just couldn&rsquo;t help myself. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned all my previous versions of Sensato E were crap, but this latest version is going in the right direction. It seems I just need some time off, everytime I&rsquo;m stuck. It&rsquo;s now much more organic, unlike the stiff contrast-lacking previous versions of Sensato E, and the colour is much better. Perhaps I should take the &lsquo;organicness&rsquo; even further, but the overall system of the typeface seems to be working now :-)</p>
