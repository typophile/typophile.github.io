body: Hey everyone, I'm trying to design a variation of "Infinity". I wanted to create
  a typeface with the same flow as Infinity, but give the letters a square edge. This
  is my first typeface/post. Your help would be highly appreciated. Thank you for
  your time.

    /f/ seems awkward (perhaps move the stem rightward and extend the arm leftward
    (like in the /t/. The reversed /s/ for the /z/ also seems a little uncomfortable
    for me."

    existing typeface and deformed it.\r\nPlus, the typeface literally consists of
    one copypasted shape - no imagination."

  body: It's a bit too modular/linear and not styled enough for my liking. The letters
    need to be individual and unified somehow. Here they seem to be using repeated
    parts in unharmonious arrangements. For instance the counters of /a/ seem wide
    next to the /b/ because it's a different shape and needs compensation as the counter
    isn't as tall.
