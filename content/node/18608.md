  \ :)\r\n\r\nI'm having a devil of a time tracking down a font called Obbsidda.  I
  did find a <url=http://typophile.com/node/1108>post on these forums from a couple
  of years back</url> on it, but nothing else.  I'm guessing it used to go by the
  name Modular Bold, but the font that comes up by that name in Google searches bears
  no resemblence.  It was owned by NovelFonts.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where I can
  get a copy of this font these days?  Or even a relatively decent proxy?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nTom"

  body: This was NovelFonts' version of the (predigital) VGC typeface Modula Bold.
    The only digital version of this weight that I know of was created by the now
    defunct Casady & Greene. They called it <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm"
    target="_blank">Kasse FLF Bold</a> (there are three weights in the download).

      to find a copy of the actual font, even if its part of some huge compilation.\r\n\r\nTom"
