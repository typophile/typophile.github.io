body: "How do I redefine hyphenation rules for a given language? (First: where is
  the file for, say, German?) The change I want to make is simple: I want to allow
  the replacement of \"\u017F\" (long s) for \"s\", without that affecting the rules.
  Is this possible, and as easy as I imagine it should be?"
