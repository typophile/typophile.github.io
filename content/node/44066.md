body: "I'm working on a few logo proposals for a client right now. One of the directions
  that we discussed was a revitalized-70s Herb Lubalin approach\u2014though trying
  to keep some distance from the super trendy (and often very beautiful) work of that
  nature that is out there right now. We talked about Avant Garde, but\u2026 it's
  just Avant Garde. It seems so obvious and makes me wonder and assume that there's
  got to be some more interesting options out there. \r\nIf anyone has a face in mind
  that is similar, but brings with it its own unique personality, I would love to
  hear from you. \r\nThanks~"

    for a more ''Bauhaus'' feel (not the typeface)? Also, let us know what the company
    does, and we can help you further from there.  '

    The aspects of Avant Garde that I feel fit for the client is the light weights
    and the simple geometry. \r\nThe client is a photographer\u2014a wedding photographer\u2014that
    is trying to approach the industry with more of a fine art or high-end feel; drawing
    near high fashion, but not quite. That's what brought us Avant Garde in the first
    place. \r\nThanks for your input, though. "
