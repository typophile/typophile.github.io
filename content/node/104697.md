  wisdom... failing that I'm trawling for hours for the answer on google and it'll
  make me cry with frustration!\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to create a series of posters.
  These posters use a font as it's focus \u2013 word play on a font for the purpose
  of creating an amusing poster. I aim to sell the posters. Can I do this? Clearly
  I'll need to license said font to use it on my mac, but then after that I'm unclear
  as to the ramifications.... i.e. commercial gain of using a font to my advantage.\r\n\r\nThe
  posters would only appeal to designs really, as designers more familiar with fonts/typefaces.\r\n\r\nHELP!!!!\r\n\r\nThank
  you :)"

  body: "@\_Emma, each font has its own licence. So if you'd like to have advice you
    should tell us which font you\u2019d want to use. Generally, if you buy a font
    from a professional vendor, you have the right to use it commercially. But be
    very careful by using fonts which you have downloaded \xBBfor free\xAB somewhere.
    Some/many of these fonts are illegal knock-offs. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Sorry, read your
    posting wrong. So don\u2019t mind. "

  body: Like Renko said, you should read the license. But if it's a professional font
    that you purchased, it's almost certain that the license allows commercial use,
    otherwise professional designers wouldn't buy it as almost all their work is commercial.

  body: "Hi, thanks so far! I added this post to 'Release' section too and made an
    additional comment:\r\n\r\nto clarify a bit more... I'd be using the name of the
    font/typeface in a phrase..and setting that phrase in the font/typeface I am referencing...
    so for example 'Frutiger Salad' then doing an illustration of a salad bowl using
    letters as fruit (all set in Frutiger)... \r\n\r\nMake sense...?!! Produced via
    screenprinting.\r\n\r\nSorry!"

  body: "Be careful here with the use of the word \"Commercial\". \r\n\r\nGenerally,
    and IANAL, in End User License Agreements, the general terms for license are \"Business
    and Personal use\". This covers what most users expect, the ability to use the
    font software to create documents of various kinds; correspondences, advertisements,
    publications, posters etc. \r\n\r\nThe term \"Commercial\" in an EULA generally
    means using the actual font software in a product that will be sold. Game, App,
    set-top box, etc. This usage is usually not allowed in a standard EULA and requires
    an additional license fee."
