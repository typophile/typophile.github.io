body: "We just released the new Krasny Mir font (formerly and briefly titled Red Star
  prior to release).  It's a strong titling font based on soviet-era Russian poster
  lettering with some neat features.  You can find it on our main site at <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com\">the
  Scriptorium</a> or on our new lite site at <a href=\"http://www.typesmith.com\">TypeSmight</a>.\r\n\r\nBoth
  places offer samples and a free download of the working demo version.\r\n\r\nDave\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/krasnymirmf_6459.jpg]"
