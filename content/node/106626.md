  body: "Given the French attitude that French design is number one, I expect that
    a French company would look at French fonts as the inspiration for their logo.\r\nEt
    voila! RATP looks almost identical, except for the tip on the A, to a horizontally
    stretched version of Chambord Medium Italic, by Roger Excoffon. Chambord was released
    in several weights and Italic by the Fonderie Olive in 1945-51. As far as I know
    Chambord has not been digitized. For a full alphabet specimen see\r\nJaspert's
    Encylopedia of Type Faces, 1970, at p. 259.\r\nDon"

  body: "Chambord or Peignot? That is the question. Both appeared at about the same
    time and the uppercase is virtually identical. Chambord had an italic, Peignot
    did not. Peignot had a pointed A, Chambord did not. On balance, I believe RATP
    used the Chambord Italic and adjusted it to have a pointed A. \r\nThere was a
    dispute about the status of the two fonts. For a brief discussion see http://typophile.com/node/75590.\r\nDon"

  body: 'That''s exactly what Don explained plus a global touch of laziness and lack
    of inspiration to me. I''m pretty convince they started with Peignot Demi and
    somebody brilliantly suggested to shear it, mainly to evoke ''speed''. And as
    it was probably not enough speedy for everybody, they also stretched it, an all-time
    classic design gimmick of the 90''s (RATP logo is from 1992). '
