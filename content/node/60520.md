body: Anyone know of a way to automatically produce rounded stems without the "bone
  effect", illustrated to the left in the picture? Preferably in Illustrator, since
  I work with strokes. Perhaps a plugin which lets you control the calligraphy brush
  tool to a greater extent..[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild_3570.gif]
