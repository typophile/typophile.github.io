  do I move glyphs in the font window to make my own \"sorting\" and structure?\r\n\r\nIt
  would be nice to just drag them, but when I do something else happens :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontwindowgg_5875.png]"

  body: Switch to Index mode and then you can drag glyphs around. Once you have a
    configuration you like, you can save it as an encoding file that you can use for
    other projects.

  body: "The Index mode shows you the order in which the glyphs are organized in the
    font. The number displayed above the glyph is the glyph ID, a.k.a. GID.\r\n\r\n(For
    example, InDesign's Glyph Palette displays each font repertoire in the same order
    as seen on FontLab's Index mode.)\r\n\r\nOnce you have your encoding file, you
    can do Glyph --> Sort Glyphs --> By Encoding, and the glyphs in your font will
    be neatly arranged :)\r\n"

  body: "If you don't have an encoding file, you can sort first by glyph names and
    then by Unicode, and your glyphs will have a sorting order that is at least not
    entirely unreasonable. \r\n\r\nA."
