body: I'm working on a website for a client where I've been sketching with Domaine
  Sans Display Light on large main titles. It says coming soon on Klim Type's website
  and I have been crossing my fingers, but the deadline is closing in and I will have
  to find an alternative. Does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative sans that
  has a similar combination of elegance and lightness?
