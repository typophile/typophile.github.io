    I think is the awesomely important thing) and the relation to the font-business
    ( if it is called so ), or is there a way/method? =)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, really.\r\n\r\n\u0130lke."

  body: "I expect everyone who does font IDs has their own methods. The more fonts
    you have seen the more you will immediately recognize the style of a font, which
    helps to focus your attention. It helps if the sample includes some letters that
    often have distinct earmarks, as in this case where the N cross stroke does not
    reach to the bottom of the rhs stroke. Some other distinctive letters are the
    lower case g, uppercase Q, capital R, capital G, k etc. Try to identify the context
    of the sample: music, book cover, woodtype, monument etc. and when it was made.
    Do a special check of foundries that have an interest in particular themes, e.g.
    SciFi/Techno at Iconian, Retro 1950s at Font Diner, Fancy Victorian at Font Mesa.
    Give some thought to font makers that that do not show up at MyFonts, Identifont
    and Dafont. Tags & categories recognized by search engines, from Google, Identifont,
    MyFonts to individual foundries can help. Be aware of the best of new fonts lists
    that can be checked. Anyone can play the game. No need to have a relation to the
    font business, although if you have made fonts it really increases your attention
    to details. Admit when you have misread the image--mistakes are guaranteed to
    happen!\r\nDon"
