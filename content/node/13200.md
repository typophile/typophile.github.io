body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nI have this old type sample that I need to ID. I'm fairly
  sure that a digitized version doesn't exist - It looks like one of these old swash
  fonts from back in the photo lettering days. Can anyone either ID this or suggest
  some good alternates with the swash falling after the letter, like in this case.\r\n\r\nThanks
  Everyone!\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think this is an old version of Ray Larabie's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/shifty-chica/">Shifty
    Chica</a>, I don't know why he changed it. Perhaps the original was a derivative
    work??? (email Ray for details) The new version, which you can find on MyFonts.com
    is very different.

  body: Thanks Guys - Kinda looks like finding a digitized version could be a little
    tougher than impossible. Appreciate all the help!

  body: oh, it's easy enough to find... but since since this is one of the gray areas
    i'm not too sure about, i feel odd linking directly to it from Typophile.
