body: "Can anyone help me out with this question:\r\n\r\nI used to have Copperplate
  Gothic Bold and Copperplate Gothic Light on my old Dell, but got rid of it and got
  a new IBM ThinkPad and it doesn't have those fonts anymore on my new computer.\r\n\r\nI
  need to get the same font that my colleagues have, as we work on common documents.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know where I can purchase just the basic Copperplate Gothic Light and Bold
  fonts that often come standard on Windows machines?  When I go to a font site, it
  has all these different font sizes for the Copperplates, but I need to know what
  the basic ones for Windows are.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nStephen Ezell"

    with all options) should give you the fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
