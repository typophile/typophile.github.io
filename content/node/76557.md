  only way I could describe what I'm trying to do, is in the picture highlighted.\r\n\r\nI
  have scoured google for answers/tutorials, but all I get is how to set path <cite>
  around </cite> a circle.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how I would set type like this in inDesign?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMat."

  body: Set text at 600dpi or above in PhotoShop then use Text Warp tool (see image)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextOnArc_5733.gif]
    This is quick and dirty but will work.

    flowing without distortion.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TextOnCircle93_3623.jpg]\r\n\r\nKind
    of a pain though. Draw the baselines manually, Convert to text paths and thread
    them in the proper order.\r\nYou will have to play around a bit. Make some mistakes,
    like not having the paths in the right stacking order.\r\nBut once you set it
    up- you will have a great re-usable template."

    to draw a circle, copy and paste it on top, and decrease its diameter by 2p (or
    whatever) and repeat until you have as many circles as lines of type. Then make
    each circle a path for type, draw some guides for column breaks, and drag the
    ends of the type paths to the edges of where you want your columns to be. Here's
    an example. Of course, you can adjust the ends of the paths to make each column
    a quarter of a circle or whatever. Then you'd copy the whole group of circles,
    paste them on top, and rotate 90 degrees for the next column.\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id1_4293.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/id2_4876.jpg]\r\n\r\n[Edited

  body: It's just to show the idea- I'm just drawing some Celtic knotwork in Illustrator
    and realized I could use the centre line I had drawn as a text-path. Connected
    it to your earlier question and thought it would be funny. I like the effect though,
    maybe I'll do one for real sometime- but maybe start with a simpler knot.
