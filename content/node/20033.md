  body: The new FDK will include the Adobe PS auto-hinter, which can be run on fonts
    as a stand-alone utility as part of the FDK, and which FontLab will also be able
    to incorporate into its own programs. I'm pretty sure FontLab will do this, since
    it will be an improvement over the current FL autohinting, but will give users
    the option to manually edit the results, which the autohinter does not by itself.

    I actually have been using the latter, which I assume will be included in the

    Miguel has clarified, the auto-hinter is already a FontLab plug-in macro, and
    a separate command-line tool. It can be run on both Type 1 and OpenType CFF fonts
    (or in FontLab on any font with PS style outlines, which can then be exported
    to Type 1 or OT CFF). However, we could hope for tighter integration into FontLab

    with negative attitude toward MS)  - and in order to keep it clean, let us talk
    about FDK (& FontLab.)\r\n\r\nIf FDK can support the OpenType features that FL
    can't handle - that will be great.\r\n\r\nI don't know what stage FDK is in, but
    if it were up to me - to add these features and wait even 6 months - then add
    & wait.\r\n\r\nBut since I'm not behind the Adobe  curtains I don't know what
    Adobe is up to. However, since FDK isn't like any other product by Adobe (e.g.
    InDesign, Photoshop - that you keep everything secret till the release ) maybe
    you or Thomas can shed some OpenType light.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n"

    that is in AFDKO 1.6. When AFDKO 2.0 is released, it will take some time until
    that code is incorporated into FontLab Studio, so in the meantime, AFDKO will
    have some advantage. However, from what I remember seeing at Read Roberts\u02DA

    maybe use some of the scripts and plug-ins.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    and positioning but shares two or more different codepoints, its good to assign
    all these codepoints to a single glyph. Some kind of \"compression\". \r\n\r\nThe
    problem I see is, if one codepoint is included in feature or kerning code only
    and an other one uses a different code. In these cases the FDK should report an
    error and suggest a codepoint splitting.\r\n- The same for shared names.\r\n\r\n--<a

    other implications. (We actually have discussed this issue internally). Could
    you give another example?\r\n\r\n> <em>The thing with double assignments: [...]
    And why not?</em>\r\n\r\nAs Thomas said, the OTF spec permits double-mapping (a
    given glyph is mapped to more than one Unicode value), but that makes it hard
    for Acrobat to reverse map from Unicode encodings to character codes, for searching.\r\n\r\n>
    <em>If a glyph have exactly the same outline, spacing and positioning but shares
    two or more different codepoints, its good to assign all these codepoints to a
    single glyph. Some kind of \u201Ccompression\u201D.</em>\r\n\r\nAn OpenType [[CFF]]
    (Compact Font Format) font will have the \"compression\" you're looking for. It's
    called [[Subroutinization]]: process by which common elements in a set of glyphs
    are decomposed in separate subroutines.\r\n\r\n> <em>The problem I see is, if
    one codepoint is included in feature or kerning code only and an other one uses
    a different code. In these cases the FDK should report an error and suggest a
    codepoint splitting.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't get it. Does this mean that, for example,
    you wouldn't put the two Delta (U+0394 and U+2206) in the same kerning class?
    I might be missing something, but the only reason that would stop me for putting
    them in the same class, would be if the glyphs' designs were different."

  body: "Hello Migel,\r\n\r\nyes, the german thing is specific. In general I think
    most of these double assignment scenarios are very specific. In most cases no
    real alphabetic or \"word building\" glyphs are involved, but accents, punctuation,
    numbers or signs could be. Typically these things will not be searched. \r\n\r\nbut
    you ask for samples: (please feel free to post better ones)\r\n\r\nhypen 002D,
    hypentwo 2010  \r\nblackstar 2605, star operator 22C6\r\nslash 002F, big solidus
    29F8 (depents on the slash design) \r\n\r\nIf I understand some comments about
    the CFF compression right, it has its limits if the outline data is reaching a
    high volume or complexity.\r\n\r\nI see the point with the Acrobat compatibility
    issue, but if someone wants a \"proper\" PDF for a special long term archive,
    he should use special or standard clean Adobe fonts too. I don't see the point
    to restrict it for every possible font development. \r\n\r\nIf the pdf creator
    stores the double, tripple assigments too, it should be possible to search these
    glyphs in a proper way. One step forward is to store language specific warpers/tags
    around the text elements. \r\n\r\nexample scenario: \r\n\r\nSomeone use a tripple
    mapping for a real alphabetic glyph like B for latin, greek and cyrillic. So,
    if the search string is given in an unicode enviroment, its always possible to
    match the right glyph or string, since all unicode assigments are stored. Language
    specific warpers will help to filter possible \"false\" strings from other languages.\r\n\r\n--<a

    \r\n\r\nyou\u2019re talking about introducing more flexibility in the domain where
    we, font developers, have influence (the way glyphs are named or encoded in the
    font) but on the other hand you want other domains (applications) to worry about
    making sure that everything still works fine for the user. In other words, you
    want to buy yourself some freedom at the expense of application developers. \r\n\r\nBut
    this will not work. Font developers are a smaller community and therefore can
    work out certain standards of behavior better. Application developers are a very
    large group and their efforts are rather uncoordinated. For example, you say \"if
    the pdf creator\". But there are 200 different PDF creators on the market, some
    relying on partial implementations of the standard (e.g. the Quartz engine in
    Mac OS X), some relying on implementation of older PDF versions, some relying
    on the PostScript-to-PDF conversion etc. At least in half of the scenarios, OpenType
    PS fonts are converted to Type 1 fonts (so cmap, GSUB etc. are all removed and
    only glyph names travel into the file) and the additional Unicode stream is not
    stored. Therefore, the PDF really only has a visual glyph representation of the
    text, there is no metadata. Such PDFs will ALWAYS be better searchable if the
    each glyph has a unique glyphname and just one Unicode codepoint. You should not
    think of PDF being only dependant on what Acrobat is doing. The problem is less
    and less with Acrobat because Acrobat is getting smarter and smarter. But there
    are many other tools for searching inside of PDFs, for example plugins for Spotlight,
    Google Desktop Search or Microsoft search etc., and there is no guarantee that
    they will ever be as smart as Acrobat. \r\n\r\nThe point in font development,
    especially with OpenType, is to try to make the fonts work as good as possible
    in *various* systems and applications. This often includes making some compromises
    or doing redundant steps to make sure that certain information is present in three
    different places. I wish it were different but *we* don't have any way to change
    it. \r\n\r\nIf you don't like the way the Adobe FDK for OpenType writes the cmap
    table, you can always change it with a tool like TTX or you can use FontLab Studio
    5 to build your fonts. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nttx -t cmap yourfont.otf\r\n\r\nwill produce a file \"yourfont.ttx\" with
    only the cmap table. You can edit it, rename to \"yourfont2.ttx\" and merge into
    your .otf using \r\n\r\nttx -m yourfont.otf yourfont2.ttx\r\n\r\nThe result will
    be a font yourfont2.otf which will contain the new cmap and the rest of the tables
    will be identical to those in the original yourfont.otf. \r\n\r\nIn fact, in most
    cases, you can use one and the same cmap-only .ttx file for the entire family

    line spacing between font families and between different version of the same font
    (Std, Pro)? \r\n\r\nI hope this is possible by adding it simply to the OS/2 table.\r\n\r\ntable

    its not working, why?\r\n\r\nSince the old .fpr project file format has changed
    it would be very usefull to provide us with an example file. Ok, the makeotf.py
    generates it.\r\n\r\nI have some guru meditations on windows. \r\n\r\n1. the mystery
    of -nr\r\n\r\nIf I use a project file I got lots of the time: [FATAL] unrecognized
    option (-nr)\r\n\r\nBut I never used such an option. Is this relateded to unix
    ascii line breaks? \r\n\r\n2. no relative paths under windows?\r\n\r\nThe makeotf
    don't accepts relative paths if its called without *.fpr file. But with it, it
    works with relative paths. - Then cames the mysterious -nr error into play.\r\n\r\n3.
    This message on a test font without feature code. \r\n\r\nmakeotfexe.exe [NOTE]
    <XXX> There are -12851 instances of the deprecated \"except\" syntax in the feature
    file. Though such statements are processed correctly by this parser for backward
    compatibility, please update them to the newer \"i gnore substitute\" syntax.
    For example, change \"except a @LET sub a by a.end;\" to  \"ignore sub a @LET;
    sub a' by a.end;\". (Note that the second rule is now required to be marked to
    identify it as a Chain Contextual and not a Single Substituti\r\non rule.)\r\n
    \r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nWorking with *.fpr files seems to work not properly under
