  body: go to myfonts.com and type in "nouveau" or "art nouveau" in the window at
    the top right, you'll see lots of choices.

  body: You need more than a font to make it work. Look for a Dover book on Art Nouveau
    for borders and other marks and search the web

  body: "Look up Alphonse Mucha, the king of Art Nouveau, for colors, styles, etc.
    Lots of flowery stuff and colors that came back into vogue in the 1970s. Also
    look up Vienna Secession and Jugendstil.\r\n\r\nA couple of \"art nouveau\" fonts
    I can think of: Auriol, Desdemona, etc... \r\n\r\nDon't confuse Art Nouveau with
    Art Deco."

  body: "Tanks everyone! Ive found an ok headline font now. But still looking for
    the text font, the serif. Does anyone have a clue which typeface they use on the
    front of \"The Yellow Book\"? Or a similar face, used in the same period. Would
    realy appreciate your help.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yellowbook_4235.jpg]"

  body: Petter, if you could show us the typeface you have decided upon for the display
    I think we'd know which direction on a match for the text. I'm not sure using
    something like this as on THE YELLOW BOOK is art nouveau enough.

  body: "I found a font called KOLO LP, which has a clean nouveau look. It feels a
    bit hand drawn. The text side of the menu will have a frame, similar to the one
    in the picture that I have uploaded. The other side of the menu will be decorated
    with an rather typical nouveau illustration (inspired by Alphonse Mucha).\r\n\r\nIs
    KOLO LP a good choice? If so, what would be a nice typface match? Should go with
    a face like BELWE or perhaps JENSON, SOUVENIR, LTC FORUM TITLE or ELPHINSTONE.
    Hmm, I\xB4ll think I need some guidance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kolo_lp_5090.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/frame_6223.jpg]"

    enough to be Art Nouveau.  It feels more C.R. Mackintosh/ craftsman than Mucha/Studio/Paris.
    \r\n\r\nELPHINSTONE is too ... too ... calligraphy.\r\n\r\nBELWE has potential
    for content, and <strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/arnold-boecklin/\">arnold-boecklin</a></strong>
    may work for display?\r\n\r\nBut -- I don't think anyone does it better than <strong><a

  body: "I'm liking Auriol too.\r\nHowever, I think that for a menu, ya gotta have
    some of those lovely borders as in the sample you show, so it's really a question
    of integrating the type with the style of the border.\r\n\r\nWindsor (Light is
    very classy), Korinna, and Souvenir have that \"triangulating the circle\" art
    nouveau shape.\r\n\r\nFor another tack, Advertiser's Gothic."

  body: Auriol is gorgeous, especially if you have the complete family. It works amazingly
    well at small sizes too.  Great suggestion.
