  hes\r\nafter something  that says NOTHING  , and is just there....but have the same
  presence as a Paul Rand/ Lance Wyman logotype but without evoking anything.\r\n\r\nthis
  easy and hard in two ways.. he seems to want to make a parody of lets say the united
  airlines logo with same colour sheme without evoking it in any shape or form\r\n\r\nthus
  far hes been playing around with helvetica bold..\r\n\r\nbut i suggested a better
  more suggestive typeface would be univers Black and Extra black faces for almost
  that cheesy generic  faceless look.... in particular we are looking at the letter
  C, to give you an idea of whats trying to be achieved here.\r\n\r\nnothing geometric,
  nothing humanistic, nothing condensed, il be willing to see examples of italicised
  \ forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nalso, we were talking about how on certain materials letters
  bleed, whether its because theyre kerned too closly or the process has affected
  the print. the sort of effect he wants is something like this : \r\n\r\ncan anyone
  recommend both a logo typeface\r\nand a text face that would suit these needs,..
  i have some ideas so it would be interesting to see if im going in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  very much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
