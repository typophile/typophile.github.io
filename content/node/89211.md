  and I was wondering: is it a custom typeface or is it available for download somewhere?'

  body: "Nice poster. The designer made some unusual choices \u2014 the image is very
    static for a dance poster, and the headline is hard to read \u2014 and yet I find
    the poster to be visually compelling. "

  body: Ah. I saw the Behance portfolio a while back and just assumed it was custom,
    but the outcome is definitely customized to interact with the image.

  body: "@Nick Shinn:\r\nit's a simulation. josip kelava made an actual redesign for
    the company's identity.\r\nbut i do not know when this design will be printed
    on real billboards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe font is not custom it just offers three
    different alternatives for each glyph, so talented people like josip can combine
    them with nice photoshop work.\r\n\r\nif you want to see more about the process

  body: "Yes, it didn\u2019t strike me as the kind of thing that a dance company would
    approve (for instance, the \u201Cavant garde\u201D style of the type would not
    be appropriate for something from the classical repertoire, and in general it
    overpowers the images of the dancers)\u2014and the mock-ups were a little too
    slick to be real."
