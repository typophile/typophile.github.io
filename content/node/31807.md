  On his blog, [[Erik Spiekermann]] has <a href=http://www.spiekermann.com/mten/2007/02/metaserif.html>posted
  a preview</a> of the upcoming MetaSerif (or MetaAntiqua) by [[Christian Schwartz]]
  and [[Kris Sowersby]]. I've heard mention of MetaSerif on Typophile one or two times,
  but this is the first time I've seen it. Looks nice to me at first glance; it seems
  to blend with Meta "Sans" especially well, as one would expect.

    newsletter, we were surprised there were so few families that do this well. Expect
    the Meta family to play together very nicely.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it may actually
    be named \"FF Meta Serif\" (with a space)."

    pretty.

  body: That looks like it's going to be a very nice addition to the Meta family,
    making it ever more useful.

  body: I'm liking the looks of that. Always on the prowl for the perfect serif font
    for my purposes--that one might almost be it.
