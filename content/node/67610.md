  building of an old mental hospital (along with a bagful of peculiar negatives, but
  that's not relevant to this forum). i'm not sure what the typeface is. please excuse
  how dirty they are, i have yet to acetone them.\r\n\r\nany help? if you know someone
  i could contact, that would help too. the internet is a nasty place to google up
  \"movable type\" because there's a publishing software by the same name."

    in the 1800s simply to number their gothic typefaces\u2014e.g., Gothic No. 7,
    Gothic No. 13, etc., or sometimes simply Gothic Condensed or Gothic XX Condensed."

    since indeed this design is pretty nondescript and versions of it were put out
    by very many different foundries.

  body: "ah, yes. a look in the american typefounder's index:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aapainfo.org/atf/ATF.pdf\r\n\r\nscrolling
    down to the \"gothic\"s, we pages of them. no matter, it just gives me a better
    idea of what i'm looking for. i didn't really need to know this exact typeface\u2014
    i'm just curious as to the story behind the gothics.\r\n\r\nbrockfrench\u2014
    i agree, the blocks, when dirty, are pretty, but i'm using them for printing,
    and if they're coated in congealed printing ink they don't work well. the texture
    that it produces when printed is nice, but is not for everything. besides, i can
    always dirty up the lead again if need be. a sample:\r\n\r\nhttp://i50.tinypic.com/t4vdvm.gif\r\n\r\neliason\u2014
    it's 72 point type, if that helps. again, i'm not interested in this exact face.
    a minor curiosity is all."

    book \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\" to try to identify
    it. \r\n\r\n[edit: I can't, because I don't have my book where I am staying today.
    If you don't need to know exact font, it may not matter to do this work.]\r\n\r\n-
