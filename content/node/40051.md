body: "I'm looking for a modern typeface (probably sans) that connotes performance,
  leadership and entrepreneurship; if it looked a little techy that wouldn't be such
  a bad thing.\r\n\r\nRight now, my closest faces are <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=415110\">Neo
  Sans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/interface/corp\">Interface</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/foco\">Foco</a> ... <a

  Bold Italic</a> is close but looks a little dated, unoriginal.\r\n\r\nIs there anything
  new or unexpected that someone can suggest.\r\n\r\nIt should be durable enough for
  web/motion graphics. This will be a brand's primary typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

  body: I like Apex a lot, but it seems like it could have a little more personality
    and a stronger leadership quality.

  body: Of course, anything is going to look dated when the only text you have seen
    it in references the Mary Tyler Moore Show.

    DTL fonts are very expensive, but I cant help it \u2013 I just love the clean
    design of DTL Argo. \r\n\r\n"

    Argo at work, so that's a lifesaver. I was actually pricing something from <a
    href=\"http://www.teff.nl/index-type.html\">TEFF</a> earlier ... and I almost
    fell out of my chair!\r\n\r\nVesta is nice but a little low key. Stalemate is
    great, plus I love <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/\">Fountain</a>. Can anyone
    think of one that would make a good brandmark (i.e. a little more distinction/personality)
    as well?"
