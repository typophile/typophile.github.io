  body: "Rick, \r\nIt's indeed custom. De Bijloke is a music center in Ghent, Belgium
    hosting a variety of concerts, from ancient music to symphonic, from classical
    Western and Eastern music to jazz. [[http://baselab.casasin.com/project/fonts|Base]]
    created an identity for this music center, with the goal of reaching a new public
    and bringing classical music to life. A vibrant yellow dot enlivens the medieval
    building and the visuals expected of classical music. This graphic element was
    applied to signage, and translated to typography. \r\n\r\ntitled: Debijloke Bold\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/De_Bijloke_Font1_5304.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/De_Bijloke_Font2_5386.png]\r\n\r\nfor
