body: "Fellow Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI was asked to design a new logotype for an organization
  called NUEYS. The National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students (NUEYS) is an independent
  organization that was established in the 1960\u2019s. The purpose of the organization
  is to uplift and consolidate scattered youth initiatives into a coherent group movement.
  This is the first project of this type I have worked on and I found it a great experience.\r\n\r\nThe
  wreath is directly inspired by the golden arch found on the Eritrean flag. For the
  character I was inspired by the branches of the wreath that looked like legs. What
  do you think of the mark?\r\nI have also added a branding variant of the mark which
  will be used for very young children in the region.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flag_5306.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  am not too sure about the type. Ideally it should be in majuscule already. I have
  used the Delicious typeface by Jos Buivenga, its lovely and free (which is an important
  factor) but I am not sure it fits the design. If anyone has any alternatives I am
  open to any propositions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nueys_6654.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts and comments?\r\nThanks!"

    up the wreath needs to look a little more child like- looks more man not a boy.
    When I first see this design- it looks  Olympic or United Nations to me.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact have you tried variations with boys and girls near the wreath? \r\n\r\nI
    like the wreath with colors in it- but that happy face is not working for me.\r\n\r\nSo
    if I had to choose a design now- it would be the first one with the colors of
    the last one.\r\n\r\nAll my best to you,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Thanks for taking the time to comment. I attempted portraying a teenager
    but you are correct, it is too much like an adult. I will try making the character
    younger. Having more characters will be difficult as I think it could lose a lot
    in legibility.\r\nThe smiley face version is simply the logo that will appear
    on products for much younger Eritrean. Its a sucursal in a way.\r\nI dont think
    having a UN / Olympics connotation is a bad thing do you? It was never intended
    that said.\r\n\r\nSo thats one vote for the Delicious font :)"

  body: "I agree with your use of Delicious (so now it's 2 votes). It conveys a professional,
    yet youthful feel. \r\n\r\nAt first, I thought the same about the figure being
    too adult-looking, but I think if it were made any smaller, then it would be harder
    to see at smaller sizes. \r\n\r\nThe happy face reminds me of my Playmobil toys
    from when I was a kid - maybe not a bad thing considering they were my favorite
    toys growing up.\r\n\r\nNice job!"

  body: "Good choice of typeface. I'd also include the multicoloured leaves in the
    logo targeted to the older youth as well.\r\n\r\nIf you find the figure is looking
    too old, try making the head a little bigger.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I was thinking the same thing about making the heads bigger, but I forgot
    to say it. So if Lex says so, then it must be a good idea ;)\r\n\r\nI disagree,
    however, about making the leaves multicolor for the \"older\" logo. If I was a
    teenager (which I'm not that far from), I wouldn't want a logo with rainbow leaves."

  body: "Thank you all for the comments. My concern is the Delicious type when used
    the way the board desires, in majuscules, does it still look ok?\r\nThis is the
    revision they have asked of me with the colored wreath. I added a larger head,
    very well thought Lex!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nuez_5963.png]"

  body: "I take back what I said about the multicolored wreath - I really like it
    after seeing it executed. I think your use of Delicious here still looks good,
    except now it reminds me more of a heathcare company or hosiptal - the uppercase
    loses it's youthful feel.\r\n\r\nStill looks great!"
