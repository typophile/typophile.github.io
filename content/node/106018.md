  is that it is custom, but would be great if anyone knows of something close.\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4617490039745_er5rI2PS_l_5947.jpg]"

  body: "Double faux calligraphic. (It ties in with the faux na\xEFve trend.) This
    is probably drawn with a skeleton path and a pen effect applied in Adobe Illustrator.
    A real pen would not produce such shapes. A pen would, for example, produce different
    marks for downstrokes and upstrokes. Poor emulation of a pen > turned digital
    font > knocked out of image. Good thing I grew a mustache prior to logging in
    to Typophile.\r\n\r\nNot to say professional type isn\u2019t also sometimes faux
    calligraphic. The early type founders likely started with traces of the pen \u2014
    but unlike the above, it  would\u2019ve been a real pen. So, emulating the pen
    in metal > negatives > digital curves. (And then spending months and years fine-tuning.
    Often forgotten.)"

    Maxime T\xE9tard and Romain Rachlin for one of their bespoke typeface called \"La
    Berline Caligraphique\" (as stated on the poster), calligraphic version of \"La
