body: "\LI am happy to announce the release of our new typeface: Colvert.\r\n\r\nColvert
  is made by four designers: Natalia Chuvatin, Jonathan Perez, Kristyan Sarkis and
  Irene Vlachou.\L\L Colvert is comprised of four families: Colvert Arabic, Colvert
  Cyrillic, Colvert Greek and Colvert Latin. These four type families can be used
  alone, or blended with one another, in an harmonious way. Each family has been made
  by a designer native speaker of the concerned writing system. \L\L\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colvert2_3893.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  character has been envisioned as a peculiar approach to the question of the relationship
  between different writing systems. Each of the four families that make up Colvert
  is as visually differentiated as possible. We have tried to establish a minimum
  optical continuity and not to seek homogeneity between these type families, so each
  one can express at the best its own characteristics. \L\L\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colvert3_6154.jpg]\r\n\r\nColvert
  includes all that seems to us necessary for the professional use of a publishing
  typeface for print: extended support for languages (more than 100 languages), small
  capitals (Cyrillic, Greek and Latin), oldstyle figures, polytonic Greek and Arabic
  ligatures.\L\L\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colvert5_6022.jpg]\r\n\r\n-

  body: "It\u2019s interesting that the common glyphs in Greek-Latin-Cyrillic are
    not identical.\r\nThere\u2019s no reason they need to be, except perhaps in multi-script
    display settings.\r\nDid you experiment with that kind of layout?"

  body: "Thanks for your comments.\r\nAbout your question: the goal was to work on
    differenciation, but we have tried to avoid taking systematic decisions. For each
    glyph, we have tried to think wether it is interesting/logical or not to make
    a differenciation. \r\nThen, when we have taken the decision, I think we must
    keep this, even at display sizes (even if we can imagine how we design the difference
    could change between text and display sizes)."
