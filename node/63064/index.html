<p>Specifically, regarding AIGA&rsquo;s position that the spec work is damaging to the clients. Following AIGA&rsquo;s logic, BrandStack is as harmful to the clients as the 99designs. Yet no one here or on other logo-related sites calling to boycott it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can understand both sides.</p>
<p>The professional would see at design contests as an easy (and cheap) way for &lsquo;clients&rsquo; to choose the best design(s) from a whole catalogue of &lsquo;free&rsquo; works, hence eliminating the professional consultation. It sucks.</p>
<p>The amateur designer sees design contests as a way to test their work against like-minded amateur designers, and to build on their own competency/skills level in designing.</p>
<p>Perhaps, a solution could be tutoring from the professional to the amateur? Takes time and considerable effort, of course.</p>
<p>A professional could come up with a logo/design challenge and entries/submissions by amateurs are critique upon.. Amateur receives feedback required. In the long run, professional protects his rice-bowl..?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Spec work is an extremely touchy subject, and you should in absolutely no way attempt to learn anything from a real design process through these &ldquo;contests.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s said ad infinitum why you shouldn&rsquo;t: you lose the chance to consult a client, the potential to be ripped off is extremely high, and you usually get less than what you&rsquo;re really worth (if you get paid at all).</p>
<p>If you want feedback, why not try sites like Logopond, deviantART, Flickr&hellip; the list goes on and on. What&rsquo;s even more enraging is that I just found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the contest on Crowdspring<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and they&rsquo;re only offering $400? Seriously? A global firm whose image needs desperately to appeal to investors and businesses of all kinds, while showing dozens of personality traits&hellip; $400. That&rsquo;s the mark they will use for the rest of their existence as the face of their company, and you think that costs $400? That&rsquo;s not even one month&rsquo;s rent for you, even if you live in an efficiency apartment.</p>
<p>Anyways, you posted up your design to be critiqued. I think that the type looks very dated. And why did you break the pattern of shapes at the bottom of the &ldquo;e&rdquo;? The first version possesses very muted and dull colors in my eyes, while the second&hellip; I like the cyan, but why the gradient? It looks like it&rsquo;s casting a shadow of doubt on the mark.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the first two images, the first thing that catches my eye is how busy the e logo is, but that is taken care of for me by the second two which just use gradients. The shapes could be a bit much, but it seems like the alternating colors in the first two images are what make it busy. Maybe it&rsquo;s just me; I AM a huge fan of gradients. It&rsquo;s a great design though! I especially like the font used in the name of the company.</p>
