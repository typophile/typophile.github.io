body: "Hi,\r\nI am currently building an arabic font with a number of contextual alternates
  lookups.\r\nIn some of the lookups, I use groups as substitution targets and/or
  context.\r\n\r\nAll my lookups and groups seem to follow the appropriate syntax;
  the font compiles just fine.\r\nHowever the \"substitution behaviour\" of those
  lookups which use groups (instead of a list of individual substitutions) is completely
  erratic. Per ex, in a lookup where I have:\r\n\r\n< Group1a > -> < Group1b > in
  the context of being followed by < Group99 >\r\n\r\nin which the elements of Group1a
  are: A and B (in that order)\r\nthe elements of Group1b are: A.alt  and B.alt (in
  that order)\r\n\r\nWe would normally expect A to be replaced with A.alt  and B with
  B.alt\r\n\r\nHowever it is not what is happening. Instead, A is replaced with B.alt
  and B is replaced with A.alt. \r\nIt is not simply an inversion [which itself would
  also be puzzling]; with larger groups, elements A, B, C, D are replaced randomly
  (ex: A by C.alt, B by A.alt, C by D.alt, D by B.alt)\r\n\r\nThe randomness does
  not come from the glyph order in the classes. The glyphs in each respective class
  are enumerated to match the position of the substitute glyph in the other class.
  In the vtl and vtg files:\r\n\r\n\r\nDEF_GROUP \"Group1a\"\r\n ENUM GLYPH \"A\"
  GLYPH \"B\" END_ENUM\r\nEND_GROUP\r\nEND\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\nDEF_GROUP \"Group1b\"\r\n
  ENUM GLYPH \"A.alt\" GLYPH \"B.alt\" END_ENUM\r\nEND_GROUP\r\nEND\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\nDEF_LOOKUP
  \"Calt01\" PROCESS_BASE SKIP_MARKS DIRECTION RTL  [#this is an arabic script font]\r\nIN_CONTEXT\r\n
  RIGHT GROUP \"Group99\"\r\nEND_CONTEXT\r\nAS_SUBSTITUTION\r\nSUB GROUP \"Group1a\"\r\nWITH
  GROUP \"Group1b\"\r\nEND_SUB\r\nEND_SUBSTITUTION\r\nEND\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe
  random substitution happens for a given lookup even when I delete all the other
  substitution lookups to make sure there is no unforeseen \"interference\" or problem
  of substitution order/sequence.\r\n\r\nClearly if this is not working I must be
  doing something wrong, but I've checked again and again, notably by comparing with
  \"Arabtype.volt.ttf\", and I can't find where I'm erring.\r\n\r\nAn inelegant way
  around this would be of course to explicitely enumerate each 'glyph to glyph' substitution
  individually (and it does work that way for the few lookups I've converted) but
  using groups *should* work and there are lookups which contain 30+ glyphs to substitute
  in the context of 6+ glyphs so I would not want to have to enumerate each combination
  individually.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated! Thanks,\r\nPatrick\r\n\r\n"

    Glyphs in groups are always ordered by their glyph IDs and not by the order implied

  body: 'Yes, Karsten has it right: the GID orders of the two groups need to be cardinal.
    This limits the use of groups in substitution lookups. Generally, I recommend
    against the use of groups in this way anyway, since it doesn''t provide any visual
    feedback on the substitutions in the lookup.'
