body: Redesigning a magazine. Looking for a great serif typeface that will serve as
  main text and also work for display type. I'm pushing for Centaur MT, but I need
  to come up with alternatives. Large-family typefaces a plus.

    body: "It's a major university alumni magazine, so it has a very broad readership
      \u2014 about 160,000 circulation. \r\n\r\nCurrently using Goudy Modern MT, 11
      pt on 13 leading. Looks a little heavy and dated. Wanting something a bit lighter;
      will probably stay with 11 pt size."

  body: I'm partial to Miller.  I've never had occasion to use it, but I've kept it
    in mind ever since taking note of its use in both New York and GQ  magazines (if
    I remember correctly) because of its legibility and pleasant, rounded character.  There
    are 14 styles both for text and display. I tend towards san serifs for most of
    my work, and I've never really had to contend with many pages with lots of text,
    but I remember Miller specifically because I read the two aforementioned magazines
    and liked the way the body copy read, so I called the design departments to inquire
    what the font was.

    if not there could be some options for magazine layout available;\r\nDelicato
    - a traditional bookface but also working well for magazines. Large family with
    plenty of laternates and ornaments.\r\n\r\nSophisto - play together nicely with
    Delicato as a headline typeface. Also large family\r\nwith lots of dingbats, signs
    etc. Stalemate could very well be an option."

    Old Style</a> is lighter and will keep that Goudy warmth, which you might want
    in communicating with Alumni. \r\n\r\nI think Centaur would be a problem for magazines,
    because of its small x-height. It tends to look pale and tiny except at large
    sizes.  "

  body: "Many of Fred Smeijers' (Arnhem, Quadraat, Renard) and Martin Majoor's (Scala,
    Nexus, Seria; Majoor is a favorite designer of Abbott Miller) typefaces work well
    for magazine design. Their design philosophy of purposely designing idiosyncracies
    in individual letters makes them particularly suitable to display settings; it
    goes without saying that they work well in text settings.\r\n\r\nAlso recommended
    are Jonathan Hoefler's Hoefler Text (used quite a bit by Robert Valentine) and
    Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones' Mercury (designed for Esquire Magazine; with hints
    of New Century Schoolbook and Fleischman). \r\n\r\nRather than \"Delicato,\" I
    would suggest Jeremy Tankard's Enigma, which Delicato strongly references. (Details
    Magazine currently uses Enigma.)\r\n_\r\nDavid Cabianca"

    body: Now I'm leaning towards Enigma for serif and Stalemate for sans. Hopefully
      it'll take at the meeting.
