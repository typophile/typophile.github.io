  body: "It has somewhat rounded edges like Helvetica Round. But if you look closely
    at its ends, they are not fully round. Plus the l makes it look mono-spaced, but
    it's not. Actually, a few letters are not like Helvetica.\r\n\r\nIt looks as if
    was a home-made stroke font, not a professional outline font, as most if not all
    designers make today.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. As a stroke font, it's very good.
    I would be shocked if it isn't a stroke font.\r\n\r\nIn a way, a stroke font is
    easier to make, for our PostScript-like font format, the stroke font will always
    be equal stroke widths. In Prof. Knuth MetaFont/Tex technology, every font is
    a stroke, not an outline, but the designer can apple multiple widths to a stroke."
