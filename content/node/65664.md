body: hi everyone, is anyone can identify this type it would be tremendous help. This
  logo was provided by client as outlined ai file. The bevel in the Z is hard to match,
  otherwise primex comes close.

    it looks like it worked  :)   any idea what this typeface would be? Like i was
    saying except for the Z everything else looks like Primex, which was suggested
    by whatthefont"

  body: that was a good suggestion but again the Z doesnt match. The problem is that
    there are bevels on the outsides right where the letterform bends, kinda hard
    to see in the image but they're there.

  body: "thats interesting, i only went from what I saw here: \r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/big+noodle/fonts/
    \  then type ZIVELO in the sample text area\r\n\r\notherwise you're right it looks
    like there are bevels on the Z. I might just leave it at that then, thank you
    feelingrandy and altaira for clearing that up :)  cheers"
