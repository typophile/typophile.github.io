body: If the first &#34;press&#34; established in the Americas was in use in Mexico
  City in 1539, what are the chances that a monumental text by a Jesuit sometime near
  1599--in what was then a remote region of Mexico--utilized a typeface designed in
  the Americas rather than Europe?  I guess my question is, which is more likely under
  these circumstances, a Mexican or European typeface?

  body: I would suppose the Spanish brought their typefaces with their printing equipment.  Do
    you know the answer, or are you just teasing us? <BR> <BR>Some Google searching
    came up with an authority one might ask if you want to really know. See <a href="http://www.cbsr.ucr.edu/CCILA_Progress_report.html"
    target="_blank">this link</a> for a UCR project collecting printed material of
    the Americas.

    from a printing firm in Seville. <a href="http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/time/1400s.html"
    target="_blank">Another article</a> I found said he brought printing equipment
    with him, and I presume this would include type.
