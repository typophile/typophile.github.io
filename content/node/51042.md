body: "Hi Guys,\r\nI'm currently working on creating a Font, my first, and have spent
  many learned hours grinding away with nodes and metrics. Slowly getting comfortable
  with FontLab.\r\n\r\nJust a quick question.\r\nI have 31 individual pairs of Glyphs
  that require their own customized kerning because of the way they relate to each
  other.\r\nMy Kerning Table is present displaying the 31 pairs and their kerned relationships.\r\nWhen
  I type in 'Preview Mode' the pairs are kerned perfectly.\r\nWhen I generate the
  Font as a Truetype Font and install the font into my OS(XP), the kerning isn't present
  in either the programs 'Illustrator CS2' or 'Word 2007'.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is there
  a setting I should have checked/unchecked or something else I should have done that
  prevented or would have helped the kerning to be applied from my FontLab file to
  my final TT File?</strong>\r\n\r\nAny help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\r\nI've
  looked everywhere through the Settings and I know as a newbie there is something
  missing or something I have failed to do. I just don't know what.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDrj\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I assume it's the file itself. Not any one specific program at fault."

  body: "Sorted out the kerning problem in word 2007. (found the setting)\r\n\r\nBut
    what is it with illustrator CS2?\r\n\r\nSomeone else asked the question I'm asking
    too...\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29932\r\n<strong>See the bottom response from
    the link above, which says...</strong>\r\n<em>\"i dont think it\xB4s right, because
    in FL Studio i make the kerning, and whem i write in the illustrator the adjustment
    dont appear. Im ms word i activate the kerning in the panel FORMAT.\"</em>\r\n\r\nIn
    IllCS2(on XP) I cannot find any kerning setting within the Preferences.\r\nOn
    the Character palette 'Auto' doesn't read the TrueType kerning.\r\nSetting the
    the kerning to 'Optical' is just a poor man's attempt at the exact kerning and
    not right. Users of my font through Illustrator shouldn't have to manually set
    the occasional kerned pair.Should they?\r\n\r\nI now have the kerning working
    in Word 2007, and the .ttf works just perfectly in Coreldraw with kerning exact.\r\n\r\nIs
    this an Adobe issue?\r\nI know that Photoshop is a bitmap imaging app, but I just
    tested the font to check it and yep, the kerning is not present in the font.\r\nTherefore
    I have a Microsoft App (Word) and a Corel(CorelDraw) App reading my font OK, but
    Adobe Apps will not.\r\n\r\nAny theories?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"
