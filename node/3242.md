    Arrow</a> has equally sharp serifs, but that&#39;s not it neither.

    &#34;Homage to the Alphabet &#34; book, page 322. Image to follow.

  body: Here is Romana Ultra from the Phil&#39;s Photo book. I checked MyFonts for
    the current Romana&#39;s and they are not the same. The &#39;r&#39; and &#39;y&#39;
    are what is not the same, so evidently this is some other foundry&#39;s version.
    The E&#43;F and URW versions have the Ultra weight like a Bolded Bold, and the
    Ultra weight in Phil&#39;s book show definite character changes from the Bold.<img
