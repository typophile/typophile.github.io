  body: I think it is partly a result of the extreme difficulties of typesetting in
    the nasta'liq style. Until quite recently, almost all the newspapers in the country
    were handlettered. So there is a large number of professional signpainters and
    letterers, working with both Urdu and English, and a public understanding that
    if you want a sign painted you go and hire one of these people. This contributes
    to a culture in which there is an expectation of quality in signpainting, even
    in protest banners, that is not undermined or homogenised by cheaper and faster
    mechanical lettering options. You see the same sort of quality, although much
    more restrained in style, in late 19th and early 20th century suffrage protest
    signs in Britain. <a href="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/MOLsite/piclib/images/%5CMID%5C0330001209_5mb.jpg">This
    image</a> is a good example because you can see both the quality of the protest
    signs and banners and, in the background, the standard of poster lettering on
    which the signs and banners are based.

    the country were handlettered. \r\n\r\nYes, I remember reading (also on the BBC
    site I think) of how\r\na small team of scribes, under the guidance of a layout
    designer,\r\nhandwrites the various news stories in columns of the neccesary\r\nsize,
    and then it all gets collaged and photocopied or photographed.\r\n\r\nSo what
    other cultures with difficult-to-computerize\r\nscripts enjoy highly accomplished
    public lettering?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    These are people dedicated to make hand-lettering signs all over Mexico, on front
    shops, walls, cloth, vehicles, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting (only from
    the visual side \u2014in my opinion\u2014) book on this subject\u2026 Sensacional
    Mexican Street Graphics. The book shows many examples of \u2018Rotulista\u2019
    work, although is more image oriented rather than typographical. \r\n\r\nI apologize
    in advance, because the only examples I have to show right now are of blackletter\u2026
    nevertheless most lettering in Mexico is roman! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/carniceria.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reparacion.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Salon.jpg]"
