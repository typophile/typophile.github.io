  body: It's so close to Memphis that it looks more like a custom job based on Memphis
    than a different font.

    body: There's some slight differences like the serif that is not angled like Memphis',
      but it's pretty close. That makes it even more tricky! Thanks!!

    the angled serifs:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/memphis/\r\n\r\nAgree with
    fvilanakis that the detail in the counters is custom.....\r\n\r\nPragmatica Slab
    also is very close, and has squared-off serifs:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/pragmatica-slab/"
