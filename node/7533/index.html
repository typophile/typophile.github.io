		<div class="commentbody">Israel is the Jewish state. I will not shy away from being called anti-Semitic by opportunists and ignorants by saying &quot;Israel&quot; when I mean &quot;Jewish&quot;. Yes, nations do exist, but so do peoples, and sometimes a nation is overwhelming the same as a people, overwhelmingly shares the people's attributes (no, we're not all the same - we just all deserve respect), for example the deep Jewish desire to avenge the Holocaust*. Japan for example has virtually no foreign population. So trying to differentiate between &quot;Japan&quot; and &quot;Japanese people&quot; is mostly pointless. But seeing problems in the ideology of a group of people is not the same as dicriminating against its individuals, which I don't do, and nobody should. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* That's where the hubris is coming from: it's an over-reaction to thinking that everybody wants you dead. But 95% of people in the world simply want to live in comfort and decency. This includes Palestinians. When you take away their most basic rights, you're either hoping to exterminate them, or you have to be ready for them to try to kill you. The sooner Jews realize that eveybody on this planet is a person, that nobody is &quot;chosen&quot;, that nobody really wants to kill for its own sake, then they will come back into the world's fold again. What they're doing now is acting exactly like the people who formed their contemporary, persecution-syndrome view: the Nazis; like father, like son. Advice from one ancient people to another: calm down. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Individuals are not directly responsible for the actions of other individuals, but they most certainly should feel responsible for the mindset of their society - otherwise you get a bunch of selfish, petty monkeys. Muslim Americans for example are partly responsible for improving the lot of both the US and Muslim nations. I am responible for three nations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; were you enslaved and murdered? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am Armenian. Our Genocide goes conveniently ignored by the likes of the US and -tellingly- Israel. Also, I grew up in Beirut, during the war. We had about 260 car bombs. My uncle was assasinated. I guarded my school one day a week from 2-4 AM. I was held by the Lebanese Army, after being shot at for being in the wrong place. My brother's car had bullet holes. Two guys tried to carjack my father, and failed when he swerved to make them fall out the doors. And this is all the tip of the iceberg of my youth experience. So I've seen -and felt- much more than you, don't worry. I get my views from the ground, not Fox News, al-Jazeera or the Jerusalem Post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Firstly, I don''t think that Israel has an attitude of &quot;pay back&quot; because of the Holocaust. Most of the population here come from Arab countries rather than Eastern Europe and don't even know what the Holocaust is so there goes that theory down the drain. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding the Armenian Genocide, half my staff is Armenian and we live in Israel and we don't ignore anything. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regarding the Palestinian people's right to live. Of course they do. And they have the same rights that I do, as a Jew living in Israel and you do living in the US. However, they don't have the right to blow up children at discos, or doctors at cafes, etc. Unfortunatly when Arafat (not sure if he is still alive at time of writing) sends (sent) out children (yes 15-year-olds) to blow up civilians in Jerusalem (which nearly happened today), then the rest of the Palestinian people are going to suffer the consequences. That may mean at shopping malls they will get searched more carefully, and it also may mean the Israeli soldiers may go through their houses in Jenin in order to find the minority of suicide bombers that want to kill us. However, please note that the Israeli army will do everything in it's power not to harm any civilians and invariably succeeds which is more than the American Army does (note recent events in the search for Bin Laden). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh and finally, I worked for 3 years at the Jerusalem Post and although the editing and spelling may leave a lot to be desired, their reporting is damn good!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the link, Hrant. I will read through it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think what bothered me, to be specific, is the association of all Jews with the Israeli administration. I disagree that the word 'Israeli' and 'Jew' are interchangeable. It's not generalities that bother me, or racial determinations, it's the discussion. These distinctions drawn about Jews are typically associated with violence done to and by some Israelis (many of whom are Jews), and that (to me) calls for great care, even verbally. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But perhaps I'm derailing an already difficult discussion.</div>

I'm talking about the global scale; killing people in other countries to maintain stability in yours is still violence, and it furthermore brings such behavior into normalcy, because you're voting to carry out the crimes.

		<div class="commentbody">Arafat had a peace agreement handed ito him on a silver platter by Bill Clinton and Ehud Barack in 2000 at Camp David, yet he turned it down. Why? It contained the most provisions Isreal had ever made toward a Palestinan state, yet he was unwilling to negotiate. It was he and his supporters who started the second intifada in lieu of having peace and independence. Israel is defending themselves, in the same way that any European country would do if it came under similar attack. Western Europe has grown complacent. As the last members of their war generation die out, they seem to forget that they themselves once lived in situations that were less than peacefull or idyllic. The US is often accused as being overly supportive of Israel. But the EU member states are overly supportive of Palestine. Maybe its time for a neutral country (Canada? Japan? Brazil? Anybody?) to step in and lead the negotiations.</div>
