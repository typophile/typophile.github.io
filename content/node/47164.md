  don't know too much about the nuances of typefaces so at first I thought it was
  just a manipulated Arial but now I think I am totally off. If you don't know the
  name of the font, could you refer me to some that are really similar please? Thanks
  so much!\r\n\r\nAlso, I couldn't \"insert image\" without getting an error so I
  attached a copy of the font for you to see.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6476.png]\r\nI see a geometric Futura-esque
    sans, with swash caps and a Venetian \u2018e\u2019. It reminds me a little bit
    of the <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts\">Chalet
    package</a> (though not really), and, the swashes aside, the closest I can think
    of would be <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html\">Hypatia
    Sans</a>, with a number of its stylistic alternates switched on \u2013 also no
    cigar."

    I guess my browser (Safari 3.1.2) got confused by the space in the file name and
    showed me a different file."

  body: Akkurat seems to look the closest. I don't think it's Futura-esque because
    I feel that Futura is a bit too round and cute...

  body: Oh and there were no examples of the lowercase letters of this font. I got
    this from a website and they only had it capitalized.

    that I saw a different image (the one I inserted above, \u2018Of this Tale \u2026\u2019)
    first. Your link took me to that image.\r\n\r\nAfter I emptied my cache, I could
    see the other image.\r\n\r\nP.S.: At least I can prove that I\u2019m not insane:
