  the whole font creation thing (being still a student) I have been looking into a
  number of commercial books for guidelines but none of them offeer some basic rules
  of the trade like standard optical corrections that each letter needs, kerning specifications...
  my typography teacher has a do-it-you-self style that is good to begin with but
  not of much use any more.... \r\n\r\nIf you had to name one book that kind of sums
  the whole thing up, which would that be?\r\n\r\nAny other web sites that might offer
  guide lines?\r\n\r\nPlus does any one know wich fonts Nat West uses?"

    check out [[Drawing_How-To]] for links to resources on the web."

  body: <strong>"Schriftschreiben/schriftzeichnen"</strong> by Eugen Nerdinger (sic!)
    and Lisa Beck. Very thorough book an the anatomy of the western alphabet, and
    it distinguishes between writing and drawing letters. In german, though, and i
    think it's out of print. i was able to buy my copy on a german online 2nd hand
    bookstore.

      Where do you think I could find it?\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario could you print
      a couple of pages and send them via mail (I know I'm asking for a lot but I
      am really interested to see how technically deep can one go about formulating
      rules in Typography)\r\n\r\nThanks again."
