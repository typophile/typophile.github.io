  who have designed a buiding for an eye hospital. The brochure will act as a showcase
  for the project and is aimed at their clients and the wider architectural community.
  The finish size will be 210 x 210mm and very image-led. \r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if anyone has any ideas for a typeface that might be appropriate. I was thinking
  that one designed with good legibility in mind might be a place to start \u2013
  or is that too much of a cliche given the subject of the brochure?\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  in advance."

      Grotesk, the usual... Lineto''s Akkurat being the latest addition to this line
      of types . Its more a question of composition, proportion and Spacing to make
      it look spectacular ... Just try with Helvetica on a photographic background
      until it looks like a Architecture Book, should work out just fine.'

  body: "Thanks so much for all your suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn response to James, they're
    a practice who do a lot of \"community projects\" such as hospitals and schools
    etc, as well as more commercial schemes. They do some lovely work and seem particularly
    good at working with \u2013 and considering \u2013 the end users of the buildings
    they design. I wanted the choice of typeface to reflect that in some way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
