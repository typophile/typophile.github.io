  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Typophiles,</p>
<p>Now a days it has almost become a trend of having those glossy, 
shiny and stylish gradient logos. The Microsoft Silverlight logo 
would be a perfect example to give. I know that lots of people 
didn&rsquo;t liked it and were screaming when it was released. But why? 
Why can&rsquo;t we have such logos? Personally I loved it and have no 
problem with having such logos even in the future also. Logo 
is just an identity and anything can be logo as far as its unique 
and easy to remember. Earlier, the printing was a big problem 
and we use to prefer flat logos but, why now?</p>
<p>What you all think?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this before—that the traditional sense of how a logo should function has been steamrolled by cheap 4-color printing.</p>
<p>So we used to have to design a simple logo so faxes and one-color business cards etc. could use the logo. Now, products like this one may never appear in one color, or need to be shown small. Maybe this mark will function in all the intended usage situations. I can see that it would completely fail used small in a K only newspaper add.</p>
<p>I guess my lingering problem is that at some point a company will need some of its identity to work in the classic ways a mark used to be designed to work, and photographic/photoshop marks like this can&rsquo;t fit into that identity.</p>
<p>I also think that there must be a super saturation point with all the craptastic photoshopish over illustrated detritus that floods my eyes. Let&rsquo;s hope this look goes out of vogue just like everything else.</p>
<p>^Total rant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thinking in terms of rules &hellip; like there is some great cosmic code that&rsquo;s in violation here &hellip; is a setback in effective design. The main relevant questions are: Is it distinctive? Does it represent the product&rsquo;s character? Does it appeal to the intended audience? Can the client afford it? Will it work in the medium where it will appear? In regards to MS Silverlight, I would answer these questions as:</p>
<p>Distinctive: Acceptably &hellip; I recognize it right away, but it does seem a little generic
Representative: Doubtful &hellip; but I haven&rsquo;t used Silverlight web apps enough to know for sure
Appealing: Hard to say (who is the intended audience? web developers, mostly?)
Affordable: Definitely
Practical: Mostly &hellip; it&rsquo;s mainly used online</p>
<p>I work in broadcasting, and broadcast logos, while they often have a static counterpart, can be very colorful, fluid, organic, and especially these days, animated. The animated logos can be good or bad, but as a viewer I think some of them are really cool and represent their show or channel or station very well. And there is no doubt they fit the primary medium very well. Paper is not everyone&rsquo;s foremost concern &hellip; nor should it be.</p>

<p>Say the Silverlight product becomes a supporter of some charity event, and the Silverlight logo, along with 5 other logos, needs to be features in reverse on the bottom corner of some small take-away collateral piece. Now you have to send them something to include or use a text-only version. Or maybe the logo need to be features on a very large banner, but the original is a photoshop file that is 11 x 11&quot; or so.</p>
<p>There are going to be technical demands on the mark and the inability to deliver a simple one-color mark will come back again and again. That&rsquo;s not good design.</p>

<p>Well, that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem because an image can always contain its transparency values in it. And now a days its also possible to make those vector gradients. You can blow them up, you can change their color or even the background. The only problem was the printing which is no more a big headache.</p>

Most famous logos start with some core shape and color that is distinct. Then people will argue around how that basic idea should manifest itself. If the goal is to create something people will recognize, I would consider the Silverlight logo a failure.</div>

I think they are taking advantage of the fact that there is so much media now that doesn&rsquo;t depend upon the fax machine environment.

		<div class="commentbody">The question is a bit confused here at the outset in that Silverlight is a product and not a company. So while the art may be subjected to some of the vagaries of a logo&rsquo;s life, it is essentially functioning more as the packaging and advertising of a commodity than as the identity of an organization.
That said, there is no questin that we are seeing more dimensionality in logos thanks to advances in software, media and mechanical reproduction. One could argue, however, that dimensionality only changes the way the logo <!-- raw HTML omitted -->looks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and doesn&rsquo;t change the thing itself. Just as adding any degree of dimensionality to a letter changes its appearance but not our understanding of what it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Which means that the essence of logo design—the creation of a symbol—remains unchanged and as difficult an art/science as ever.</div>

<p>Moving away from this particular example, this broad approach to brand identity does indeed encourage a kind of laziness. You tend to substitute rigour of exploration with the latest filter or effect.</p>
<p>In place of an idea you have a look. The problem, of course, is that like any other fashion, it goes out of fashion quite soon. There&rsquo;s an intro on Michael Johnson&rsquo;s website which puts it rather nicely: &ldquo;&hellip;nothing dates quicker than a style and nothing dates slower than a great idea&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which, by the way, is not be all bad. The need for organizations to redo identities every couple of years ensures that those of us in that line of work earn enough to pay our bills ;)</p>

<p>Satya, I think in practise it still is quite a problem, and will remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Even with the most exhaustive implementation guidelines, a logo of that sort is almost guaranteed to get distorted. Implementation standards, production processes, and approaches to quality vary wildly from region to region. This is particularly true in a place like India.</p>
<p>With even fairly straighforward identities suffering from poor or inconsistent implementation, these more complicated ones don&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d design something like this for a little web start-up or a boutique brand, but not for a major brand that has to work across applications and geographies.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that visual identities for software are slightly different to corporate identities proper. The ID for a program only really has to exist on a CD cover/packaging and on screen when you start the thing up. The &lsquo;ghost fart&rsquo; would obviously look lousy on a business card at 133lpi in 2 colours but it isn&rsquo;t ever going to end up there - the Microsoft logo is still just 1 colour and Adobe 2. At the same time there does seem to be a trend towards 3D in visual identities for corporations, the first ones I remember being Silicon Graphics and Astra Zeneca (which sort of looks like strings of melted cheese).

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I enjoyed reading this discussion on the Silverlight logo and thought I&rsquo;d add my perspective. I managed the development of the Silverlight brand name and identity at Microsoft.  To be clear - I am not a designer nor an expert in production. I’m a brand strategy guy. We worked with an outside partner on the logo design and rely on in-house and external partners to design and produce content that incorporate the logo.</p>
<p>What I can comment on is what our thinking was as we developed this logo. Silverlight is a tool for designers and software developers who are creating something of their own. Ultimately they control the design of the experiences they create with Silverlight.  We explored a wide range of options for the logo including more traditional approaches like those designed around real objects (e.g. the shield shape of the UPS logo or the Apple of the Apple logo) that some on this forum noted.  We ultimately decided that a design that was more open and without boundaries was more fitting with the Silverlight concept. I’m going out a bit on a limb here but in some respects Silverlight is somewhat amorphous, only taking shape after a designer creates something using it. We didn’t want to box it in by creating an overly literal logo.</p>
<p>We entered into the design process thinking animation first, static online second and print a very distant third. The static logo you see above was taken from a frame of an animation that we created. While technology and bandwidth doesn’t always make it possible to display the logo in high quality animated form, that’s our goal when possible. We knew that we would need to create static versions, print was not a priority. Silverlight was designed to be native to the Web. The idea of printing it black and white in newsprint is totally counter to what Silverlight is about.</p>
<p>There are certainly downsides to this approach but overall we’re pretty happy with the results and the response we’ve seen/heard to the design. We’re aware of the challenges in using this logo effectively and I’ve already seen some scary examples of “design” that are off-brand. We work hard to limit this by creating guidance that we provide to our design/agency partners and in most cases they do great work.</p>
<p>I hope this gives you a glimpse into how we approached this project. Feedback on the forum or via mail is welcome.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mason, I enjoyed reading your comments.  I was at SBI Razorfish when the former SBI folks were redesigning the MS Office Suite identity &ndash; there is nothing lazy about MS identity design.</p>
<p>The Silverlight identity does not feel safe. It feels aspirational, open-ended and unbounded. This will easily be relevant for the the 5+ years needed to become widely adopted. I think Hiroshige and Nick are right, it feels very current.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious to watch Microsoft branding and product development these days. You can see how Office and Windows brands  feel very constrained by old boundaries (legacy branding has recognition, but it&rsquo;s an albatross when it comes to evolving an aging brand).  However, you can see great innovation happening with Zune and Xbox &ndash; with print, television, UI that feels very current and innovative.</p>

<p>Well said.</p>
<p>Sometimes I look at the great design of the twentieth century and feel the same way a lot of people do when they see stuff like the silverlight logo. A big white page with a couple lines of text set in Helvetica? Ick. I think it’s the design equivalent of the “my five year old could paint that” comment that inevitably pops out of someones mouth at least once every five minutes at every modern art museum. It’s probably just part of the human condition.</p>
