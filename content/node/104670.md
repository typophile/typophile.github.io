  name. It appeared in Julia.uk.com\u2019s project for the Arika film festival. I\u2019ve
  often admired it from afar, and decided to have a closer look at it. I know they\u2019ve
  produced custom faces in the past, so I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if this
  was custom too. I feel like I\u2019ve seen it elsewhere though\u2026 or something
  very similar. If you have any suggestions, I would be most grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\nGordon[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arika_5458.png]"

      of suggestions. Already familiar with a few of them, but a few newbies to add
      to the wishlist if the chance arises. I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m gonna invest
      in Brandon Grotesque one of these days, and get my money\u2019s worth within
      weeks for it.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nGordon"
