<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, This may not be strictly a Type ID board question, but I was told this is a sample of PostSerif by Richard Lipton from 1998, for Font Bureau. Maybe associated with the National Post (newspaper?). I Googled these key words and was not able to find confirmation. Does anyone know if there is an italic face for this family? I found something that talked about versions of FB Miller being done for the National Post, and I wonder if this is another name for Miller Condensed.
Does anyone know about this typeface?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Rats! I am having the same trouble posting an image that one of our friends had recently. It looks like it lets me attach it, but nothing shows up. I sized it to 550 pixels wide, and it's a .gif file, so I don't know why it's not working.

<div class=commentbody>I have posted the samples on a web page <a href=http://bowfinprintworks.com/PostSerifSample.html>here</a>
Any information about this font is appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>Yes, there are similarities, but it may be because both are based on a Scotch Roman model. There are differences too, such as the 'k'. Thanks for taking a look Tiff.

<div class=commentbody>Hmm. Didn't test the K. The R isn't quite the same either. I've just emailed Robb to see if he can clarify anything.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Lucie Lacava did the redesign for the National Post. Quite a bit was written about it (and her) at the time -- maybe one of the news accounts will mention the provenance of the font?

<div class=commentbody>I tried following the Lacava & 'National Post' leads and seemed to find reinforcement that the main serif font for that paper was Matthew Carter's 'Miller' for Font Bureau. Seems that Lacava has collaborated with Font Bureau a number of times, but I cannot link Richard Lipton with Lacava Design, or the National Post design.
Thanks Marc, that was a good lead. I must admit I never heard of Lacava Design, but she's been involved in many newspaper makeovers.

<div class=commentbody>I think I can close this one out with a reply I received from Harry Parker of Font Bureau. He said that they did indeed design Post Serif for the National Post newspaper in 1999, and that it was done in four weights: Light, Roman, Bold and Bold Condensed (notice no italics). He said that they also licensed several cuts of Miller to the Post, both before and after the work on Post Serif. The Miller versions were mostly for display type, he said.
