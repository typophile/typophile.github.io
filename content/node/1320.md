body: 'Recently a generous friend gave me a PowerMac 6500, with a 17 inch Sony Monitor,
  and an Apple Personal Laserwriter 320 &#40;PostScript, 2 baby!&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
  system is in excellent condition, with: <BR>- a clean install of Mac OS 9.1 <BR>-
  48mb of ram <BR>- 5gig hard disk <BR>- CD rom <BR>- internal zip 100 drive <BR>
  <BR>it all works, too. very reliable! Even the laserwriter. Great output. It&#39;s
  all been underused. <BR> <BR>To me, this system just seems like a prime canidate
  for dedicating to font development. I&#39;m a college student with very little money,
  and my G3 is overcrowded with junk as it is, so this thing is a godsend. <BR> <BR>Obviously,
  I can&#39;t run FontLab or even TypeTool on it, so i guess I&#39;m on the look out
  for an older version of fontographer. &#40;or FL?&#41; <BR> <BR>What do you all
  think? Is this feasable? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a complete newbie to the type design world,
  so I&#39;m staring from square one. I know Illustrator well, but that&#39;s it.
  Any suggestions, advice, or help on getting started would be great. I know very
  little about the mechanics of all this. Once I get things up and running I&#39;ll
  post some stuff over in the Crit. forum. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>r.'

    using my old Powermac 8600 &#40;a pre-G3 processor &#40;the 604e&#41;&#41; to
    do most of my font design work.

    <BR> <BR>If you can upgrade to 9.2.2 you should be able to run both FontLab and
    TypeTool.

  body: Look for a version of fontographer on Ebay. Also search for Freehand Graphic
    Studio which included Fontographer in some versions. Please don&#39;t support
    Macromedia by purchasing a new version, even an academic one.
