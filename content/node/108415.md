body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask if anyone had any clue what the typeface on this
  version of Scrabble is. I've seen there is already a thread on Scrabble, but it's
  a different version and the type is completely different. Reminds me a bit of a
  thick Optima, but it's obviously not that.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/la

  body: Probably it is an exclusive typeface of the manufacturer of the games. Optima
    is close indeed. You could also have a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/ocean_sans_pro_bold/ot_ps?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=55&sample_text=abcgjmnpqrsuwx&ft=liga%2Csmcp">Ocean
    Sans</a> that will get you reasonably close in some letters.

  body: I'll look into it, it may very well be an exclusive typeface. Thanks for the
    suggestion, though. It's very similar and might work for me.
