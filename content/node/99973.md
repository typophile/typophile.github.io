  body: Don't know about that font (it seems to me a typewriter font from around the
    50s or 60s, based on something like New Century Schoolbook), but I <em>can</em>
    point you towards the <a href="http://typophile.com/typeid">Type ID Board</a>
    ("Type ID Board. Need to know what font it is? Post it here.").
