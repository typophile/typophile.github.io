body: Using TypeTool 2 on a Mac to edit a Type 1 font. Replacing circumflexes with
  macrons and that&#39;s all. But when I regenerate the font, I get reflow problems
  in the original InDesign CS doc.  <BR> <BR>I am not touching metrics, and the reflow
  affects even portions of text that do not use any edited characters. The numerical
  metrics settings on the original and edited fonts are the same as far as I can tell.
  Does anyone have an idea as to what causes this and how I can make it not happen?  <BR>
  <BR>I used to do this all the time in Fontographer &#40;much more complicated to
  use&#41; and had other problems but not reflow. Thanks for any suggestions -- hope
  they come in soon!

  body: The people at Fontlab helped answer this question. The problem was with the
    original font. It was built without a space character, so TypeTool inserted a
    new one, but at the standard width for the font instead of the narrower width
    for the space &#40;same as period and comma&#41;. The problem was noticed because
    the original font had one less glyph than the new TypeTool font. Just one solution
    to look for should you ever have a similar problem.
