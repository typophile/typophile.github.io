body: "Hi everyone, I am currently working on a project for which I have been looking
  at custom typefaces and customized typefaces used by 80's hair metal bands, for
  example:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.metal-norge.com/images/kiss-logo.jpg\r\nhttp://news.filefront.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/metallica-logo.jpg\r\nhttp://www.metal-rules.com/zine/images/stories/concerts/2008%20SWEDENROCK/logo/def_leppard_logo.jpg\r\nhttp://api.ning.com/files/*d7nuB0sL6mR7DIRfogItnA7m-ytqZsieoLTdIW0KgU_/judas_logo.jpg\r\nhttp://i.peperonity.com/c/A6CB68/19966/ssc3/home/077/black.sabbath/sabbath_bloody_sabbath.jpg_320_320_0_9223372036854775000_0_1_0.jpg\r\nhttp://www.otmg.net/artist/asia/Asialogo.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  wondered if anyone could point me in the direction of any good design parodies of
  this kind of style?\r\n\r\nThanks, Chris"

    that\u2019s all custom lettering. There are literally hundreds of free fonts in
    this style but they\u2019re all pretty ugly. In the commercial realm you can get
    some nice Blackletters in the form of Blaktur and Fakir, but what you should really
    do is draw the letters."

    in the style.

    Google does."

    to ask it the right questions.\r\n\r\nAlthough I couldn't find a book (a search
    on Amazon turned up results about the typography of the paper bands around cigars),
    I did find a movie on the subject: <em>Died Young, Stayed Pretty</em>."
