body: "<strong><em>The Work of Ismar David</em> is a showcase of graphic design, book
  arts, and architectural design</strong>\r\nA key RIT graphic arts collection is
  celebrated in a new book.\r\n\r\nIsmar David (1910\u20131996), an artist of extraordinary
  range and ability, mastered a variety of media during the course of his long career
  in Berlin, Jerusalem, and New York. In tribute to his achievements, RIT Cary Graphic
  Arts Press has now published <em>The Work of Ismar David</em>\u2014the first comprehensive
  volume on the designer\u2019s oeuvre\u2014that includes vivid reproductions of his
  book and type design, illustration, calligraphy, and architectural adornment. Content
  for the book was selected from the extensive Ismar David Archive, held in the [[Melbert
  B. Cary Jr. Graphic Arts Collection]] at Rochester Institute of Technology ([[RIT]]).\r\n\r\nAcclaimed
  typographer [[Hermann Zapf]] has written, \u201CThe work of Ismar David can always
  be identified by his characteristic style. . . His expressive drawings, with their
  undulating linear quality and unusual construction, show his elegant style in every
  detail.\u201D The book features over 150 examples of his work, often embellished
  with beautiful lettering and calligraphy, which David executed for private commissions
  and corporate clients alike. Of special note are showings of his major typeface
  design, \u201CDavid Hebrew,\u201D originally issued in the 1950s by the Intertype
  and Stempel type foundries.\r\n\r\n<em>The Work of Ismar David</em> includes an
  extensive color plate section, as well as an authoritative biographical sketch of
  the artist, written by Helen Brandshaft. The book concludes with a selected list
  of American architectural sites containing David\u2019s work, and a meticulous 15-page
  bibliography of his known book projects. Research for the book was carried out at
  the Cary Graphic Arts Collection, which holds numerous important Design Archives.
