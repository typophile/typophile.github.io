body: "Hello.\r\nI've been requested to design a monospace font on very tight requirements.
  So:\r\n\r\n    It needs to be Sans-serif, except on the 1, I,i and l characters.\r\n
  \   The height of the uppercase letters needs to be at the same level of the top
  of the ascender (example: T and t letters need to have the same height)\r\n    The
  x-height (height of the lower case letters without ascender nor descender) needs
  to be one half of uppercase letters (example: the letter a needs to have half the
  height of A; also the letter a nees to be half the height of d)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the
  question is:\r\n\r\n    What proportion do you recommend me for relation between
  the x-height and width (or between cap-height and width - it will be exactly twice)?\r\n
  \   How much should I give for kerning ? Seems to me it should be said in terms
  of proportion relative to width, or x-height or cap-height.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\nS\xE9rgio\r\n"

  body: "You don't use kerning in a monospace font, because it defeats the purpose.\r\n\r\nProportions:
    an x-height of 50% of ascender is very small, especially for a design like this.
    So I would shoot for very wide forms; maybe start with a totally circular lowercase
    letter \"oh\" and see how much narrower you'd like to make it, working with the
    rest of the lc in parallel. A generous width will also help the unusually tall
    caps and numerals (which I presume also need to be at cap/ascender height) not
    to look too narrow/cramped.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n- What about the descenders?\r\n- The
    \"t\" usually doesn't [need to] go to full ascender height; and especially in
    a font with a very small x-height that will look very idiosyncratic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
