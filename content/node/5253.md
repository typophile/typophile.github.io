body: I need a &#39;nice&#39; bold script font...  I&#39;ve always pretty much hated
  script, I think we are taught at design school to hate scripts. But anyway, a fellow
  designer has given a client a logo design in a script font, the job has now passed
  to me, and Iam meant to find a sellection of nice bold script fonts to give the
  client some kind of choice..  <BR> <BR>any idea&#39;s?

    <BR>Speaking of scripts, I&#39;m doing these letterpress cards &#40;sort of as
    a joke - more during TypeCon&#41; and I found this pretty amazing old script face
    from the Tetterode/Amsterdam foundry - you wouldn&#39;t <i>believe</i> how self-conscious
    it is - I should have a showing in mid-July. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: There are hundreds of different kinds of script. What kind of style are you
    seeking? A single category -- &#39;script fonts -- that includes all the examples
    so far suggested in this thread is a category that is too broad to be useful.
