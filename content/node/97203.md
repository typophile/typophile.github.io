body: "I purchased a font the other day, and when I went to use it in one of the Adobe
  CS programs, there's no rhyme or reason to the order of the font weights.\r\n\r\nTypically
  for other large font families (including widths and weights) I see them listed like
  this:\r\n\r\nLight Condensed\r\nLight Condensed Italic\r\n... etc ...\r\nMedium\r\nMedium
  Italic\r\n... etc ...\r\nBlack Extended\r\nBlack Extended Italic\r\n\r\nBut this
  font I bought is WAY off from this. It was from a pretty decent-sized foundry, so
  I was really surprised. It makes it really difficult to use. (Take a look at the
  attached file).\r\n\r\nSo my question: Can I fix this somehow on my end and rearrange
  them? I've got Suitcase Fusion 3, but that's it for font-specific software.\r\n"

  body: "Adobe software uses the internal data of a font to determine the best sorting
    order: width, weight, slant. Condensed fonts come before regular and extended,
    light fonts before regular and bold.\r\nSince this is data <em>inside</em> the
    font file itself, you cannot tinker with Suitcase settings, the font foundry has
    to set the correct values.\r\n\r\nIn this case it seems the Pantone flags are
    probably wrong, or possibly all left as \"default\"."

  body: As I understand it, the combination of weight number (e.g., 250, 300, 700)
    and OpenType naming (nameID 17 and 18) are the primary settings that Adobe software
    uses to sort weight/style ordering in menus. However you would need to modify
    the font data in order to change this and thus permission from the foundry/copyright
    holder if permission is not explicitly given through their EULA.

    these fonts broken and request a fixed version from the foundry. If they failed
    to provide such a version, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to fix them myself."

  body: The listing does contain internal logic though, even if it does not conform
    to Adobe menu conventions. I would be intrigued to see what results you found
    when using the fonts in MS Word, Open Office Writer or a native Microsoft (WordPad)
    or Apple (TextEdit) application, for example.

    no-mod clause is totally OK.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I totally would, but I have no idea how to go in and edit that font data.
