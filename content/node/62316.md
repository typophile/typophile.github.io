  for some feedback. I'm going to have to draw this logo from scratch and so am looking
  for some tips on how to do that successfully (I'm normally used to editing existing
  fonts rather than drawing them freehand).\r\n\r\nThis sketch shows how it currently
  looks. The letters will be filled (the second 'm' of Emma and the 'v' of Steve will
  be filled red). I'm generally happy with the look of 'Steve', but 'Emma' looks unbalanced
  due to the height of the 'E'. Any help at all is appreciated at this point.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave\r\n"

  body: Could the bottom of the E somehow loop with the S? Clever idea. I think the
    E needs to be as big as S, joining them will save space.

  body: "In this case \"Emma\" is dominated by \"Steve\", allthough she's sitting
    on his back.\r\n:)\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to horizontally align \"Steve\" with the
    first \"e\" and take away the strong feet of \"S\", \"t\" and the second \"e\".
    In my opinion this would not only improve the balance between both names but also
    lead to a better overall Gestalt. I'd stay with the connection of \"E\" and \"S\"
    and would propably also combine \"m\" and \"t\". The seperation of the second
    \"m\" and the \"v\" feels too strict. Maybe getting the \"v\" combined to the
    first \"e\" and at the same time combining \"m\" and \"v\" on their right side
    will lead to a more subtle seperation and maybe make the heart a little less obvious,
    so it doesn't look so \"planned\".\r\n\r\nWould be great to see a final logo that
    says: \"Emma and Steve form a heart in a magically surprising way!\" Right now
    it looks like there's a heart with surrounding letters that read Emma and Steve,
    which is already very good but I think the message could be communicated in a
    more effective way.\r\n\r\nI really like your current approach and I'm looking
    forward to seeing more of it."

    point about making the heart less structured and have aimed to make everything
    a bit more fluid. I have also addressed my issues with balance a little more by
    making Emma arch over a little more, rather than having a tall \"E\" and then
    the \"mma\" all run a long the same level.\r\n\r\nThere's still quite a bit of
    work to do, but I feel it's definitely heading in the right direction now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/es_thumb_5071.jpg]"

    as a connector. \r\n\r\nThis leads me on to your point epsilicon - having two
    hearts was an option, but I thought it might become too over-the-top. Having 2
    hearts would work also less well as an ampersand replacement, and the symbolism
    is slightly lost (i.e two names forming one united heart).\r\n\r\nThank you for
    your opinions though :)"

    thinning out as it's dominating a bit, but would really appreciate your thoughts.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8es_6445.png]"

    think the tail on the t maybe isolates the a and e a bit. Could it join the tail
