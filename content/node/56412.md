body: "Been trying to track this font for days. Used in the Adidas \"Dream Big\" Football
  (soccer) ad campaigns in Europe.\r\nIts used as a sub header on various TV adverts
  from 2005. The link below is from the Adidas website (Its the italic font i'm after
  not the Headline) There is no mention of the font anywhere, it leaves no trace.
  Guessing its an Adidas only font, but no clues....hope someone can help. I'm having
  sleepless nights. Heres the link: http://www.adidas.com/campaigns/verticalsfootball08/content/index.asp?adidas_cc=nl"
