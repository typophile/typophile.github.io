    couldn't resist. Seriously though: Could you tell us a little more about the setting,
    the application, intended \"feel\", & all that?"

  body: I think you should first find a font that complements Stymie, and then use
    it with Rockwell.

  body: I think these "What font goes with what" threads are a shortcut to nothing.
    How do you think typographers discover interesting combinations? Not by asking,
    but by doing. One of the great joys I had as an AD was experimenting with different
    type combos when a new project crossed my desk. Find your own combinations, on
    your own, and maybe, just maybe you will find the combo that is perfect and  has
    never been used. (I said maybe, I did not say likely).

    give you the time to find your own combinations...\r\nHaving a shortlist which
    I now have will certainly help... \r\nThanks for the humour as well."
