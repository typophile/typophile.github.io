  friend. \r\n\r\nThe idea is that it should resemble the handwriting used for marks
  on architectural drawings and things of the sort. \r\n\r\nIn the first place it
  will be bilingual (english and greek monotonic), and soon it will, hopefully, be
  \"equipped\" with polytonic support and german language support. \r\n\r\nYour comments/critique
  are more than welcomed. =) \r\n\r\nhttp://utopia.duth.gr/~vkarageo/architectural.jpg"

  body: Hurts my eyes to read. I suspect because of the small bowls in the vowels.
    Looks cool though.

    two scripts? A big hug to you - bravo.\r\n\r\nMy main criticism is that the Greek
    is clearly darker.\r\nYou either have to space it looser (I'd have to see a PDF\r\nto
    know if that's smart) or actually lighten the strokes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think it means letters that are structurally identical and/because they
    have the same origin (?). Namely here: ABEZHIKMNOPTYX (I guess). Except not only
    do I think they don't need to be \"identical\", but they shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Hrant is actually my name.  :-)\r\nIt's Armenian, and it means fiery.\r\nSpeaking
    of Armenian, FYI \"vank\"\r\nmeans monastery!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      when speaking of Armenians?\r\n<hoping he can take a joke>\r\n: )"
