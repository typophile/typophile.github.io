<p>edit:
people around here tend to take End User Licence Agreements seriously so, unless you own the rights to use the fonts in the first place, and have been granted permission by the various font&rsquo;s respective foundries to convert them yourself, i most certainly doubt that anyone on this forum will be able to help you.</p>
<p>remember, if it costs money to buy different fonts in different formats, it&rsquo;s probably not really right to do it for free.</p>
<p>you probably didn&rsquo;t know, so sorry to break it to you…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi,
When I need to convert a font I use my old standby FontHopper. EULAs' aside, when a job is on my desk and Calfisch Script bold is needed I breakout Fonthopper and I convert. You may call me what you wish, but EULAs are an absurd reality. You can call me what you want, but really think about this, if Adobe can have a patent on a typeface (I&rsquo;m thinking AGaramond here) that is not only from derivative work, but also quite like (think only a loupe could show us most any difference)  another font (think Berthold Garamond) then an EULA is not quite the Magna Carta, is it?</p>
<p>When big type plagerizes, they put on the happy face of &ldquo;Adobe Original&rdquo; for Coronos.</p>
<p>Big Type plays to the hype that when fonts (wrongly called software) are stolen that somehow the designers are going to die penniless. Guess what, if all of us paid for every font, somehow type designers would still die penniless. Long before postscript democracy of fonts was around Max Miedinger died penniless. His font was tied to one Big Type company. They sold it and sold it and we curse it as helvetica.  If ITC had the license he still would have died penniless. Did pirates make him die penniless? NO!</p>
<p>Big type puts the squeeze on designers, smaller founderies and customers. Big Type stays big as long as they dominate the market. To the point now, where small type is really just a minor league for Big Type, they act much the same, but they don&rsquo;t quite have the libraries that do not have to follow fashion to keep food on the table.</p>
<p>I do believe in order and am mostly a lawful type, but I hate it when issues regarding fonts have an unbalanced moral thermometer. You have a right to kick me for converting a font, but please scream to the mountain tops about big type too!</p>
<p>There is a good chance that if I&rsquo;m booting &ldquo;Antique Olive Nord&rdquo; and I start making some bucks with it that at some point being a pirate will be too risky to my reputation or my clients reputation, that the font will be bought to cover this risk. I&rsquo;ve yet to see Bitstream say something like &ldquo;our Swiss is really Helvetica and we should pay a royalty to Linotype.&rdquo; Believe you me they have made more money than you or I have in dealing with &ldquo;pirated&rdquo; material.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Rodrigue Planck</p>

By conversion I mean PC to Mac or vice versa. I work in a printshop environment where deadlines are already passed. I&rsquo;m not ever going to use a converted font at the onset of a job.
I&rsquo;m interested in where you think I stated renaming a font. I think on the PC there was a program that did that called FontFiddler(I&rsquo;m a mac guy).</p>
<p>You ever hear of superfonts? Funny story if you have not heard of them.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t have a copy of both fonts to compare so you got me there. but i&rsquo;ve heard how aggro Berthold gets about their licences and if there was even a chance that Adobe straight up ripped them off, i am sure there would have been a lawsuit or a settlement of some sort…</p>
<p>are you comparing all of the other critical info such as the spacing and kerning?</p>

<p>BUT this is the case of a revival, and the fonts are probably based on the same original types (yes, it&rsquo;s ok for two foundries to make fonts from the same original typeface), so it doesn&rsquo;t suprise me that the glyphs are strikingly similar. however, a font is not just a set of glyphs. it is all the other stuff that goes with it like kerning, hinting, and other bits of info that make it different from the next.</p>
<p>you yourself would argue that Berthold&rsquo;s spacing is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->superior to adobe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so don&rsquo;t you agree, in that case, that the Berthold font would hold value next to the Adobe font?</p>

<p>regardless of where i keep my fonts, it makes perfect sense that it is referred to as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->software<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in an EULA. what else are they supposed to call it? like i said before, it&rsquo;s definitely not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hardware<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. in this day and age, it is ever so important for people to protect their proprietary information.</p>

Are Royalty Free Photographs software?
Is your Word document software?
On Adobe Garamond, ok I have many Garamonds (Berthold, URW, ITC, Bitstream, Linotype/Adobe and Adobe) and none are as strikingly simillar as Berthold/Adobe. Can I tell URW Garamond is a Garamond? YES. Do I think they used a similar source to make the font,yes, but there are always interpertations that must be used to solve technical/artistic issues and Adobe Garmond is just is too close to Berthold. To boot they applied for and recieved a patent on it.</p>
<p>If font companies really wanted to protect their fonts they could make hardware keys that could attach to computers to help regulate them. I know Hoefler did some kind of font protection a number of years ago, and it seemed pretty good to me, although a bit of a hassle.
Big Type is quite deceptive though. Have you ever heard of an upgrade that wasn&rsquo;t?  In keeping up with EULAs, if I have Adobe Font Folio &ldquo;d&rdquo;, it may not contain anything about embedding of fonts. I am free to use them in PDFs left and right even today. However, when I upgrapde to Font Folio &ldquo;f&rdquo; I get a few more fonts, but the EULA has changed hopefully I have read the EULA, because if I assume that I can still embed a pdf, I&rsquo;m wrong. Now, who is sleazier, the guy who buys the font and does not read the EULA or the company that  changes their EULA and do not have the internal fortititude to say &ldquo;IMPORTANT YOUR LIFE IS GONNA CHANGE RIGHT HERE ONCE YOU UPGRADE, YOU ARE SUNK!&rdquo; No they sell like its milk and honey, then they get their heavies against you once you break their law. That is not just.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think there is a confusion between hardware, software and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->data<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll quote wikipedia for that one:</p>
<p>«Computer software (or simply software) is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information (or computer instructions), as opposed to the physical computer equipment (hardware) which is used to store and process this information. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The term is roughly synonymous with computer program but is more generic in scope.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->»</p>
<p>but more important is this quote, which i think is correct:</p>
<p>«Relationship to data
Software has historically been considered an intermediary between electronic hardware and data, which later the hardware processes according to the sequence of instructions defined by the software. As computational science becomes increasingly complex, the distinction between software and data becomes less precise. Data has generally been considered as either the output or input of executed software. However, data is not the only possible output or input. For example, (system) configuration information may also be considered input, although not necessarily considered data (and certainly not applications data). The output of a particular piece of executed software may be the input for another executed piece of software. Therefore, software may be considered an interface between hardware, data, and/or (other) software.»</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rodrigue, please stop lying. There has never been ANY version of Font Folio for which the license said you could not embed fonts in PDFs.</p>
<p>Also, although you may feel that fonts are not software, it is important to note that US courts have determined otherwise, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to address your other ridiculous assertions, because they are matters of opinion (however bizarre I may think your opinion is). However, regarding Adobe&rsquo;s Font Folio licensing, you are simply wrong as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Kesh removed the confusion between hardware, software and data?!_________________________________________________
.. but even then, there will always be someone who will unlock the keys by doing reverse engineering and removing the protection no matter it is hardware, software and/or data. It just can not be stopped.

Then why did Agfa fonts Stop being sold as part of Font Folio? How About Berthold? Embedding, Correct?
Speaking of Lies CORONOS or Today Sans? CMON THOMAS! Adobe Garamond isn&rsquo;t too much like Berthold Garamond is it? A Patent on AGaramond? Who is lying Thomas? 
I know I had a Diatronic from Berthold. Look at them in FontStudio and you will see they are amazingly similar, too close for comfort.</p>
