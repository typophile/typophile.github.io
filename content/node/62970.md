    Bossa Nova]], although I swear I've seen this font before. I think the name starts
    with a V, although I'm sure that doesn't help. :P

    look inconsistent to me: the rounds are quite a bit heavier than the straights.
    And there doesn''t seem to be any overshoot.'

    bears consideration, but I haven't finished looking at semiserif fonts.\r\n\r\n-
