body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI have bought this nice single sort you can see in the attached
  picture and now I am trying to identify to what typeface/fount it belongs to. It
  was sold as a capital J but I reckon it may be a lowercase r instead, but so far
  I have not found it on MyFonts.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nTamas"

  body: "It's oddly shaped to be either letter, but to me it seems more plausible
    as a J. I was not able to find anything resembling it, but it might help if you
    reversed the image or actually printed the thing so we could see it as both potential
    letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thank you, Mike - I will do that when I get the opportunity. The reason I
    thought it was an 'r' was that the sort has a groove on the serif side of the
    body.
