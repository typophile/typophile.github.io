body: You will find the text sample in the attached image.  The text says "New York
  State", and yes, I know it's not that visible.  I did my best to isolate the text
  from the rest, which was a pain since it was heavily blended with the rest of the
  image, and in the background.  If anyone knows what this is, I would much appreciate
  it.  To me, the starting 'N' looked like Palace Script MT, and is indeed very similar.  The
  fancy styling is not in Palace Script, though, and the S looks completely different.  Thanks
  for your help!

    body: Ah, yes I agree, though it seems to be italicized a bit more, as well as
      some other modifications.  Thanks.
