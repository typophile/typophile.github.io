I don't mean to hijack your thread, so I'll just observe and contribute what I can to your design problem. <BR> <BR>My initial thought was to use a strong, clean geometric grotesque like Hoefler's Gotham or a modern sans like Font Bureau's Interstate, but I realized it's the all-caps settings that I'm drawn to with those faces, not necessarily the mixed settings, which is how I'll most likely need to set the heads. Those are also probably my personal preferences coming through, and they may not give the right tone to the setting for a corporate publication. However, I haven</div>

They're from a distinctly later era and feel a little too modern to me. <BR> <BR>I think a range of things would work, whether Gill Sans, Futura, Metro or Franklin Gothic (just a few possibilities). Metro in particular was a Dwiggins sans serif. <BR> <BR>Of course, Kent Lew hangs out here, and as the designer of Whitman I'm sure he's thought about this a lot.

		<div class="commentbody">You know, I could swear I posted something on this in another thread, not that long ago. I get this question a lot. <BR> <BR>It's hard to separate out my own personal tastes. (For instance, I personally really don't like Futura or Helvetica and I'm tired of Gill Sans, but that doesn't mean that a skillful designer couldn't make them work with Whitman, maybe.) So don't take anything I say as gospel. <BR> <BR>Chris, if you're interested in a bold condensed, then I think the bolder weights of Franklin Gothic Condensed might be worth a look. I've been mostly using both Gotham and Franklin Gothic with Whitman lately. <BR> <BR>I think Thomas's suggestion of Metro might make an interesting pairing, given the pedigree. But you'd have to try it out. <BR> <BR>Ah, here's that other thread (Workhorse Serif Suggestions): <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34037.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34037.html">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34037.html</a></a>.

		<div class="commentbody">Here's another possibility I forgot to mention earlier. <BR> <BR>I've heard that the New York 2010 Olympic bid committee has chosen to pair Whitman with HTF's Knockout for their campaign. Could be an interesting combination if handled carefully.
