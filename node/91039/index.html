I work with graphic design at one of the oldest swedish universities and recently the university has updated its graphic profile with the help from a local ad agency. This new type combination – it's actually just been reversed, Frutiger was used for display before – is supposed to be used in all communication material (ads, posters, brochures, magazines etc). There is nothing wrong with Frutiger but in longer texts and in smaller measures – it's just really hard to read even if the leading is spacious.

If not Frutiger, what else? Yes, Neue Frutiger might be a choice, since it has a Book weight. But then I'm not sure since I traditionally prefer serifs in body (that is in extended texts). 

I feel that this whole updating process and the result of it regarding Frutiger is about being trendy and following the recommendations from and ad agency. The given explanation has been "as long as you can read it", " it's not that bad" and "our own scientists says so" (and who can argue with them?) rather than looking at why Frutiger is the best choice from a typographic and legible point of view. Of course you can read it, but again, is it the best choice in the long run? 

Talking about trends, maybe they should have replaced the fonts with something entirely new, like something Scandinavian or even Swedish? Berling Nova is a personal favorite. And when it's time for a new update of the graphic profile, I promise, I will be even more prepared.

Thanks again for the comments =)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With the risk of sounding at odds with the general opinions expressed here, I think that Frutiger can work nicely in long text settings - say, in a magazine environment. Nonetheless, What Lovisa Jones says about the look of the roman weight is true - it can be too dense on the page (same goes for Gill Sans, in my opinion). One alternative could be using Frutiger Light, rightly spaced and leaded, at 9 or 10 points, if the printer's black is a real black. The pairing with Adobe Garamond also looks interesting to me.</div>

Maybe find a very close serif companion to Frutiger

Sure, but Frutiger Serif not only fits Frutiger's proportions, it is also closer to to Meriden's original metal proportions. The structure is also in general close to Frutiger, although the italic in Frutiger (Sans) should really have changed structure the same way that Meriden does. Or at least closer to that.

But they do have a quite different feel, despite a somewhat similar structure and system of proportion.</div>
