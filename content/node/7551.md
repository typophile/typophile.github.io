body: 'I am a senior graphic design major at the University of Wisconsin-Stout and
  am currently in my researching phase of a project. I need to collect information
  for a survey/brainstorm activity for my final senior project and need some input
  from a wide range of ages and equally distributed genders. Here are my instructions:
  <BR> <BR>DIRECTIONS: Brainstorm any imagery, objects, gender stereotypes, references
  to body parts, slang, assumptions, physicalities, personality traits, behavior,
  etc. associated with men and women throughout time and today. Once you list one
  for one column, try to list the opposite in the other column. PLEASE DON&#39;T CENSOR
  YOURSELF. BE AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE! OBJECTS AND STEREOTYPES ARE WELCOMED IN THIS CASE!
  &#40;ex. women-nurse men-doctor; women-emotional men-insensitive&#41; <BR> <BR>
  <BR> <BR> <BR>WOMEN           VS.          MEN'

    way of thinking, &#34;masculine&#34; letters are more straight and &#34;feminine&#34;
    letters are more curved. <BR> <BR>Q, S , O, J, C, U - Feminine <BR>M, N, F, E,
    L - Masculine <BR> <BR>Finally, the truth about why curved letters are more difficult
    for me to draw: I do not understand women &#40;sorry dear&#41;. I&#39;d love to
    hear the ladies register their thoughts on M vs. F letters. Not sure we are helping

    <BR>Masculine: R, G, H, D, B, P, N &#40;not so sure about the curve thing&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Femine: M, V, A, Y,  <BR> <BR>Just a feeling about them, I suppose...
    also, many Serifs are feminine &#40;Goudy, however, feels like a &#34;boy&#34;
    to me, tho&#41; ; many Sans are masculine...  <BR> <BR>What about numbers? As
    a little girl, I used to have definite feelings about certain numbers&#39; genders
    and personalities... For instance, 9 is a girl and a bit of a bitch... 5, a very
    kind girl, 7 an irresponsible boy...'

    is to Pilcrow  <BR>as  <BR>Feminine is to Ampersand. <BR> <BR>ampersand is probably
    the most feminine sign. <BR>  <BR>Trae - what about 0? <BR>i feel that 9 in a
    bitch too. but 5 lookish boyish to me. maybe its a tomboy. 8 is a complicated
    women in her 40&#39;s. 2 is a girl too, but a teenager. she likes pop music. i
    think she&#39;s japanese. uh, maybe im digging too deep into her character.. <BR>
