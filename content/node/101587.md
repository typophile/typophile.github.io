  body: 'mscott, in the future it''s best to create a new post for your request. tagging
    onto someone else''s may result in it being overlooked. and it gets confusing.
    as to your answer, or maybe an answer: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/3ip/marydale/regular/|Marydale]]
    looks good until you get to the S and g. not sure what''s up with that.'
