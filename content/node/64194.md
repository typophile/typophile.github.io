  body: Actually the font looks like pixelfont from a thermal printer or something
    to me, based on Courier. The OP's idea to use [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/telidonink.aspx|teldion
    ink]] (a pixel font) seems to point in the same direction. It depends on whether
    Monsieur Jean Doe wants a clean printout or to fake tickets ;-)

  body: What I meant is I don't care about the printout, it can be clean or whatever,
    I just want the letter's shape to look like my sample if possible (I don't care
    about the texture, etc.) Anymore suggestions ? Thanks

    about that? \r\n\r\nTake Courier and horizontally scale it maybe 50% to start
    and keep adjusting until it looks like your sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
