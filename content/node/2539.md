  body: I believe than when a client &#34;thinks&#34; he needs a logo that the starting
    point for giving some credits to the whole image. It&#39;s not often that I find
    clients tha treally don&#39;t care for logos, it&#39;s the name that counts &#40;and
    I agree on some extent, depends on their business &amp; mainly clients&#41;. Maybe
    it wouldn&#39;t be fun to have all the &#34;no logos&#34; on arial.

  body: For clarity&#39;s sake, let&#39;s define a &#34;mark&#34; as a non-type graphic
    with or without accompanying logo type, &#34;type&#34; as a written/typed out
    name without a graphic, and ignore the merging element of a &#34;typemark&#34;
    &#40;i.e. monogram&#41; to avoid confusion. <BR> <BR>I believe the type or size
    of a business or industry is irrelevant to whether or not a &#34;mark&#34; &#40;vs.
    type&#41; should be used to identify it. The process of designing an identity
    includes discovering a party&#39;s unique characteristics, relative to their industry
    and their goals/objectives, then capturing your findings in a mark or typographical
    logo. How can you assume one will work better than another without applying the
    design process to the individual project. <BR> <BR>I have only been pursuing self
    employment for about five months now, after spending seven years working for in-house
    corporate design groups. One of the greatest benefits I have found working on
    my own is that I have enough control over my projects to individualize each one
    of them, instead of regurgitating portions of old projects. In the corporate world,
    the statement &#34;don&#39;t reinvent the wheel&#34; is practically a chant. I
    understand the concept of not throwing out everything you have learned, but I
    believe the statement is often used as a copout to avoid going through the design
    grinder &#40;here design is used in its most general sense, as almost every discipline
    requires some form of design...see dictionary definition&#41;. It irritates me
    to hear or read that some designers are promoting what in my opinion is an unsubstantiated
    limitation to my control over individual design projects. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: I agree, in general, with Zato and HD there. Most small/medium clients know
    they need a unique identity but only know how to ask for a &#34;logo.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>But when it comes to the actual design process I agree with Scott. I wouldn&#39;t
    rule either out without judging the merits of each, against the requirements of
    the project. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>In general the quote says nothing wrong. If you don&#39;t have to say
    anything important: &#34;shut up&#34;. <BR> <BR>My bakery never told me someting
    intelligent, so their logo wouldn&#39;t tell me anything else &#40;ignoring that
    they don&#39;t really have one, since it&#39;s times not even arial&#41; <BR>
    <BR>But even me doesn&#39;t really care nor do the hundreds of people that also
    buy their bread there, if the CI of the bakery is good or not. <BR>as long as
    the bread is OK. <BR> <BR>To propose some philosophic thoughts: &#34;Do you really
    need need to design public space? Would you really like a totally designed world
    and public space arround you?  <BR> <BR>I know the thougts jump arround a lot,
    but I hope you understand the point I am aiming at. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik
    <BR> <BR>P.S.: I agree that the variation in the field of using different typefaces
    could increase, but only if it fits to the company and its suroundings. <BR>&#40;Might
    be a bit idealistic, but there have to be some of those folks, too.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>P.P.S.: No this is no neglection of graphic design but not everone needs it,
    because most people would lie if they had a perfect image &#40;I couldn&#39;t
    deal with being approached nicely by the women working at my bakery &#40;this
    might by different in the USA&#41;. <BR> <BR>'
