  communication to promote and for his covers. Could you tell me what's the font he
  used ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stromae-Papaoutai_3951.png]\r\n\r\n
  Maybe it could help : for his first album he used Century Gothic. It seems this
  font looks like the font i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea of the name
  of this font ?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help !\r\n\r\nJ."

    the twist in the o.\r\nThis matches the twist in the O in <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=214l\">Priori-Acute</a>
    by John-Barnbrook at Emigre.\r\nPriori-Acute is an uppercase font, while \"stromae\"
    is lowercase.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrioriAcuteJohnBarnbrookEmigre_6453.jpg]\r\nI
    look forward to someone finding a match for the two versions of the lower case
    twisted sans used by Stromae.\r\nDon\r\n"

    also of the \"fake 3D\".\r\nBut I hope someone will find the exact font !"
