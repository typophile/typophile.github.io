    you use the Edit link to move the thread out of the \"Solved IDs\" section and
    up to the main Type ID Board, maybe someone could suggest something similar.\r\n"

  body: I disagree.. with more research, I think it might be Tatlin published by MacCampus,
    but I'm not 100% sure. Obviously it has some alterations, but the core typeface
    remains the same.
