  song I was is 'Playing In Her Hair' by the Dream. \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og7WtVSt7KQ\r\nI
  know, I know, it's an R&B song.\r\nHere are two digital sketches I've created. Which
  one do you think has more potential. \r\nAny typographic suggestions would be greatly
  appreciated as well, thank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dream1_6042.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dream2_6067.jpg]"
