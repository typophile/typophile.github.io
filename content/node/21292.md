body: Is [[double-mapping]] a bad thing? And secondly, if i want to avoid double mapping,
  which unicode points should i use for things like [[Delta]]/[[Increment]], [[Omega]]/[[Ohm]],
  [[mu]]/[[micron]], &c? (for the standard Mac Roman Codepage)

  body: "i didn't say i wanted to name the characters this, it just that that is what
    they are. isn't it? i mean, these aren't really Greek character. sure, they could
    double for Ohm/Omega, but i guess i always assumed that these were actually math
    operators. (or is my assumption wrong?) if these truly are math symbols, isn't
    it kind of silly to assign the greek unicode values to these characters? shouldn't
    they have the proper unicode values associated with them? I suppose for OT fonts
    you could have your Delta with the Greek unicode value and a separate character
    called Delta.math or something with the unicode value for Increment. But how should
    you resolve this for simple PS fonts? i DID read the adobe glyph list info on
    this before posting, but was unable to decipher the aswer to these questions from:\r\n\r\n<code>#
    \  1.5  [23 November 2005]\r\n#      - removed duplicated block at end of file\r\n#
    \     - changed mappings:\r\n#            2206;Delta;INCREMENT changed to 0394;Delta;GREEK
    CAPITAL LETTER DELTA\r\n#            2126;Omega;OHM SIGN changed to 03A9;Omega;GREEK
    CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA\r\n#            03BC;mu;MICRO SIGN changed to 03BC;mu;GREEK
    SMALL LETTER MU</code>\r\n\r\ndoes this mean that at one time PS fonts did encode
    these characters with math unicode points and switched to greek unicode points?
    anyhow, just trying to figure this all out...\r\n"

  body: "<em>Why would you want to use non-standard names like Increment, Ohm and
    micron?</em>\r\n\r\nGlyph names aside, there are a number of reasons you might
    want to have separately mapped glyphs for the actual Greek letters and the Greek
    letters used as symbols for increment, ohm and micro:\r\n\r\n1. You want to be
    able to reverse map from a glyph name to a specific Unicode character (Adobe's
    reason).\r\n\r\n2. You want to vary the spacing of the symbol glyphs to better
    suit them to mathematical or scientific typesetting.\r\n\r\n3. You want to vary
    the form or scale of the symbol glyphs.\r\n\r\nPersonally, unless I'm making fonts
    for Adobe, I only provide separate glyphs if I am varying the design and/or spacing
    of the symbol glyphs, otherwise I double-map them.\r\n\r\nPaul, for increment,
    ohm and micro, respectively, these are the Unicode values and glyph names you
    should use:\r\n\r\nU+2206 uni2206\r\nU+2126 uni2126\r\nU+00B5 uni00B5"

  body: So, according to Thomas' <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Facelift.pdf">"Facelift"
    presentation</a>, i'm assuming that Adobe now considers double mapping a "less-than-optimal"
    solution. Is this a fair statement? Taking this further, would double-mapping
    now be "discouraged, or is it out-and-out a "Bad Idea" to be avoided at all costs?

  body: "The <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Glyph%20names.pdf\"
    target=\"_blank\">Glyph Naming Standards</a> presentation is a bit more explicit,
    i.e. relative:\r\n\r\n<cite>Why glyph names?</cite>\r\n<cite>-- PDF creation</cite>\r\n<cite>--
    Due to legacy elements of certain workflows, </cite>sometimes<cite> only glyph
    names are left when PDF generated</cite>\r\n<cite>-- Users want better quality
    underlying text in PDF for text searchand extraction</cite>\r\n<cite>-- So, sometimes
    need to get Unicode from glyph names</cite>\r\n\r\n\"Due to legacy elements of
    certain workflows\" seems to refer to generating PDFs via PS.\r\nAnother take:
    Very few glyphs in a font are actually double mapped. Those may not be used often
    in texts. And PDFs are not necessarily generated via PS. These are quite a few
    conditions to be met so that text extraction problems occur at all.\r\n\r\nDo
    the fonts of which you speak only cover the roman/western alphabet, or a full
    Greek alphabet too?\r\nIf roman/western-only fonts, it is not really important
    whether Greek/math glyphs are double mapped or not, as long as you give these
    glyphs a uniXXXX name which is derived from the <cite>math</cite> glyphs' names
    (the ones provided by John Hudson). This because if someone uses these glyphs
    in such a font, most likely he wants to address math symbols, not Greek letters.\r\n"

    on the subject. As he says, if you don't have full Greek support you don't need
    to cover multiple Unicodes with those glyphs anyway.\r\n\r\nAt Adobe, we never
    double-map glyphs today. We did briefly in our very earliest release of OpenType
    fonts around 2000, but quickly changed that practice.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: This might be a semi-offtopic in this thread, but I would like to point out
    that the Greek set in Unicode has much better candidates for double mapping than
    3 glyph pairs discussed here. I mean the accented combinations with polytonic
    oxia which are canonically decomposed to the corresponding combinations with tonos
    and actually are exact duplicates of them. Note that in this particular case double
    mapping will not break PDF searching capability, but rather benefit the user by
    removing an unnecessary ambiguity.
