<div class=commentbody>The point of this ugly thing is that the radioactive symbol on its own is meaningless without familiarity. If I didn't know what it meant, I'd assume it was a ventilation fan. The biohazard symbol has the same problem; though it doesn't really resemble anything, it doesn't look all that unplesant without understanding its usage.
The triangle frame is an interantional symbol for "Danger" but it too is entirely abstract. Nothing particularly dangerous about it, except that it might hurt if you sat on one.
The skull and bones has had pretty long use as a symbol for poison, but this could have been handled with better stylistic consistency. But what does this symbol really say? Is it "this will make you dead" or "Warning: pirates"?
The running man symbol is the only one that is totally intuitive, and even that has the problem of having a directional arrow. What will people do if the exit is in the opposite direction?

<div class=commentbody>I think the biohazard symbol is pretty creepy.
But if it's not possible to have intuitive symbols for everything, a picture narrative makes sense.
What about the words DANGER! BIOHAZARD! in a nasty font?
Faux condensing is scary.

<div class=commentbody>I've said before that a foolproof world is an ugly world. I feel vindicated, which is not the same as satisfied.
"The symbol is to be placed on the device housing the source, as a warning not to dismantle the device or to get any closer. It will not be visible under normal use, only if someone attempts to disassemble the device."
So, <strong>it says</strong> the ceiling fan is falling at a rate that is fatal unless you jog (that way ->), <strong>but it means</strong> "not to dismantle the device or to get any closer". Now, is it so badly designed that it is not only ugly, but broken as well, by the same misguided designers? I don't think I am being too philosophical to say that there might be a correlation. Way to go, team of "human factor experts, graphic artists, and radiation protection experts" and middle management, conservative brass and PR-monkeys.

<div class=commentbody>I hate when people bitch but don’t contribute any solutions. So here, Take radiation symbol, which, contrary to the PR quotes, people can be taught to recognize (otherwise they wouldn’t have included in the trinity of fugly). Increase center to make it look different enough to get attention, copy/paste the first clip-art skull on the net in the center. Must’ve taken almost 5 minutes. Double that and I’d even make the proportions elegant. It looks like the danger is inside something, radiating out, and the selfish gene should handle it from there.
(funnier if you wait for it...)

Designers aren't capable of offering any better solution than the ones that have existed previously. At least before there was one symbol that people could be taught to avoid, combined with the symbols for biohazards, poisons, and flammable chemicals, that's not too much to teach people. Better symbols are not the problem at this point—a lack of education is.</div>

I wasn't complaining about anyone here but myself, lightly. I was just referring to my own complaining post. As lame as it is, I do happen to agree with Josh that mine is better than the IAEA's (w/ a real skull instead of the pirate tape). More immediate, less rebus. And more symmetrical.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The problem with depicting a warning for ionizing radiation is that you can't really sense it apart from being a little bit warm. How does one illustrate an invisible fire that will make you sterile and give you cancer and make your hair and teeth fall out in some days to weeks' time? How does one even imagine such an image? Abstract symbols pulled out of one's arse seem to be the only recourse, and with those you need a massive public education campaign, and we're back to where we started.
Yes, large sources can get a very very hot. That's how nuclear power plants work, but if you're close enough to feel it that much you're pretty well cooked already.</div>

Photos of Tammy Faye Baker w/o the paint? Give the right idea instinctively.
I just think that a mod of the existing symbol is the right idea. It puts to use the fortune already spent on education. With as many people as there are already aware of it, it isn't worthless. But it isn't stellar, as it is too abstract, and only seems to be chosen because it look like it belongs with similar symbols (biohaz./fallout shelter). There are a lot of ideas that might work better. Flames made of dotted lines? A diseased, shedding cat? Mr. Yuck with x's for eyes? Mr. Yuck is great, from a universal stand point, I imagine.
I suspect a team of professionals could come up with something both abstract and pertinent.
The other problem, I think is that the Rad symbol has been overused, decreasing it's alarm. Since people see it where there is indeed radiation, but they are very unlikely to suffer adverse affects (normally), they disregard the mediocre symbol. Which is why the IAEA wants the new symbol to mean, "dangerous, no really this time"; we broke the last one.</div>

<div class=commentbody>My 2 cents... Is it ugly? Yes, of course. From a design standpoint it is definitely not appealing. But according to their description, it has been tested in 11 countries, and the message was clearly understood. So ultimately - it is a success. Regardless of whether it appeals to our aesthetic sensibilities. This is a prime example of how something "ugly" can still work. I have to admit I have seen bad design, that fails miserably according to all the principles of good design, but somehow still seems to communicate.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It sounds as if they are pleased with the results they are getting and if what they are saying is accurate* and people really do undersatnd it it would be maddness to get a 'better looking' sign designed by esthetes who prize good looks over safty which is what 90% of design firms would likely generate. Anyway, my point is nobody there seems to be in the market for a new sign. This doesn't mean that it isn't a worthy cause. Far from it. And it isn't as if I cannot imagine a better sign existing!

1. Why not have the rays passing through the dude and distorting his shape? I think it would look cool; highlight symbolically the ill-effects of radiation and disuade people from becoming like the black stick man
2. Why do all the black stick men have to be emotionless? Doesn't a sad face tell you a lot ie. "you don't want to be here, I went here, bad things happened, I got sad"?

Probably to some extent. David Carson is a good example.
Don't get me wrong, this is BAD design all the way around. But apparently people understand the meaning in spite of the poor execution.
Nicholas - that works for me!
Here's my take on this. Simplify. Radiation exposure = death. No arrows or radiation symbol needed. If I see a skull like this on a sign, I'm leaving before asking any questions. Make it orange, for better visibility and contrast with the black.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rad_5090.jpg]</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, You example looks good but I don't think it gets as much info across yet. I wonder if a series of 3 signs isn't the best idea. A no entry, Death, and radiation perhaps in that order. What not to do, what will happen & why. Making all 3 ideas sit together so small seems like a mistake.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@Chris Keegan: From your symbol I read "Don't stick your head in the microwave" which I figure is close enough to the intent. It makes for a much better general radiation symbol than the existing one, and it would work well for things other than large ionizing radiation sources too (e.g.: high-power broadcast antennas, RADAR tranceivers, &c.)
It's not quite the "Get the fark out now!" the IAEA is trying to get across, but it looks a lot better.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The thing that pops into my head is who is going to put up these signs? How much are they going to get paid?
Here is the job interview might go:
________

Jethro: If whut ya mean is I been ta prison fer trespassin, yup, yer right.
Interviewer: You also have an understanding of proper disposal of refuge.
Jethro: Yesiree, I done my time fer dumpin unused roadkill and don’t be lissnin to whut some folks say bout me cuz, I am reformed now bein as I am here on prisoner release program ‘n all.
Interviewer: Well you certainly qualify for the job as long as you can tack up signs with no problem.
Jethro: Hell, I kin tack up enny dang thing ta git outta the slammer! Show me tha dang signs ta see whut yaa mean.
Interviewer: Here you go, have a look.
Jethro: That’s some weird feller runnin from a pirate flag bein whomped by a ceiling fan ain’t it? Shoot if that don’t look weird. Is this dangerous work with all that scary lookin stuff?
Interviewer: Oh no, no, no, these signs are not a bit dangerous. We tested them in a nursery and all the children just thrived around them. See here is the Goodhouskeeping seal of approval right here on the back right along with this affidavit from the President saying it is perfectly safe. If you are still worried we could lend you these very special protective gloves used by the most expensive doctors on Earth to protect them from any illness.
Jethro: Ya mean Dr Phil wears ‘um?
Interviewer: He swears by them.
Jethro: Now whut’s the pay fer this worK?
Interviewer: Ordinarily, this work goes for $5 an hour but with your prior experience we might have to up the anty to $6 and hour.
Jethro: I like the way you think! Yeseree, I’ll take that job!

OK let's start with the job title "human factor expert". I mean is that actually on someone's business card? When you get wonks with titles like that in on the committee the odds of something strong and clear emerging are mighty slim.
Then add the fact that nobody is going to see this unless they're dumb enough to start prying into a radioactive device. So it has to be ultra super clear. Hideous as this is, I have to say it does convey its message.
That said, I think the Jolly Roger inside the trefoil would probably have done the trick.</div>

If that is the case, no sign will stop them. Perhaps a simple message (before they enter the Darwin Awards list) might be more appropriate, something like: "You may now bend over and kiss your arse goodbye"

<div class=commentbody>Nope,
There are loads of hand signals that mean one thing in most of the English-speaking world that are either incomprehensible elsewhere (like this one) or mean absolutely the opposite (like the thumb and index finger forming a circle with the other three fingers up to signify OK -- you don't want to use it in Japan, trust me!)</div>

<div class=commentbody>What do you think? The idea I had was that comic strips are understtod well all around the world but that the frame used in the official example was less than ideal. The frame helps to tell the story. I also didn't get a turn around go the other way kind of idea from the offcial one. Anyway, this is untested and far from exhaustive. I think the 3rd one is probably the most successful.I also admit that I am using alot more signs/space in my example that the original did. But this seems like an application where more clarity might warent a bit more sign. Sorry my radiation symbol looks so sperm like. It's a rough...

<div class=commentbody>I like the green signs, though, Eben, as they give the reader an indication of "good" behaviour (for people too stupid to know what they should be doing!).
What about this?
