  won't allow me to post it elsewhere as it automatically flags it as a font identification
  request.\r\nI need to ask for information regarding a particular font and its designer.
  On a recent thread posted on the WhatTheFont forum, a user called AVPatch (also
  a member here) was kind enough to provide me with a little information about a typeface
  I have long sought after.  \r\nThe font is called NewCompact, and was designed by
  David C. Saunders, circa 1989. It was, from what I understand, privately distributed
  by the designer as a family of four Postscript fonts for the Apple Mac. The family
  consisted of a regular, oblique, extended and extended oblique. The obliques and
  extended versions were only available when paid for, whereas the regular was freely
  distributed as (what I assume was) shareware. I am unable to dig up any information
  or specimens of the obliques and extended versions, so I feel this forum might be
  the best place to ask. Does anybody know anything about the fonts and their designer?
  I know a David Saunders co-designed the Monotype font Columbus in the early 1990s,
  but could he be the same person that designed NewCompact?\r\nThank you in advance!"
