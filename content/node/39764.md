  and darn it if I can't find any sales going on to maximize my spending of other
  people's $$$. \r\n\r\nWhatever happened to the materialism and super consumer sales
  that are the earmarks of a December Shopping Experience?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of any good deals on complete families going on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Specials</a>, maybe there's something there?\r\n\r\nI thought House Industries
    had some specials running right now, but I can't seem to find them."

  body: Monotype had their entire font collection disk on sale a week or so ago. I
    dunno if it ended Dec 1, or if it is still on. Try www.fonts.com to find out.
    (They usually have something on sale.)

  body: "Well, I tell you what. Somebody's marketing department isn't doing a very
    good job. I somehow expected, assumed really, perhaps partially remembered?, that
    December was the month of mega font sales. How many Bergsland fonts does a person
    need?\r\n\r\n2002 Awesome Fonts on 1 Floppy! All the greats are here: Optimish,
    Universish, Palatinish, the Tymes Romain (everyone needs a replacement for their
    old default!), and much, much more!\r\n\r\nWhat I really want is fairly basic,
    I suppose. I'm starting off searching for a sans family of at least 4-weights,
    preferably Opentype with smallcaps and proportional oldstyle numbers, more rugged
    than elegant. Nothing crazy. "
