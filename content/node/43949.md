  Michigan. In my type 4 class we had to create our first ever type face, my concept
  is \"degradation over time.\" I started with a base face which has a modular look
  to it in order to provoke the idea that even a seemingly perfect type face will
  degrade and become imperfect over time. My type teacher posed the idea to add a
  second system to my face that would degrade it...something that would exist on its
  own, something non modular. Since my face looks ver tech like I decided to give
  it a virus..no, not a computer virus..the EBOLA virus, which in its stages eats
  away at you insides then finally your flesh. There are 3 faces on my spec poster
  my base face (non degraded), my 2nd face (more degraded) and my 3rd face the most
  degraded. Take a look at let me know what you think! \r\n\r\nthanks alot,\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\ncheck

  body: "I very much like the degraded edges on the letter forms.  That's the best
    part of this.\r\n\r\nEven the base, un-degraded font is very difficult to read.
    Possibly it would be easier to read if it weren't outlined -- if it were just
    black text on white background. \r\n\r\nThe black virus splotches aren't good.
    \ They are just distracting and I'm still not sure what everything says after
    trying to read it for several minutes.\r\n\r\nKeep the overall form and the pattern
    of degraded edges. \r\n\r\n"
