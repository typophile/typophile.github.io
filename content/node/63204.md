  body: "I will never draw or sketch anything in pencil.\r\n\r\nI cannot stand the
    paleness and lack of contrast that pencils make. (all hardnesses)\r\n\r\nIf you
    are too afraid to rely on the finality and permanency of an ink pen (cheap and
    high quality), then you are too afraid to make a mark and back your hand, eye
    and mind.\r\n\r\nAlso, in design studios I have worked in the past I have loved
    companies that have had pens laying around everywhere. (& not to mention computers)\r\n\r\nMy
    2 cents worth...\r\n\r\n(Oh, and a coffee or a tea while on the computer makes
    the world a better place!)"

    closely examining things like restaurant menus, signs, brochures, product packaging
    and every-day marketing communications.\r\n\r\nI have also been known to save
    well-designed junk mail for lengthy periods of time."

  body: "So in other words, how do we nerd out: \r\n\r\n+1 on the menu thing. I will
    interrupt or blank out of a conversation until I figure out what face I am looking
    at.\r\n\r\nI get visibly angry when I see bastardized type. \r\n\r\nI am compelled
    to inform others that Bistro signs are almost always in Papyrus and most Marine
    Equipment dealers are almost always in Serpentine."

    alternative to Papyrus. I think it would be well-suited for a hip bistro logo."
