  body: What about totally ignoring the revival and find your own way to rationalize
    the design? I would think the reason for the uneven color is due to the grid they
    used.  <BR> <BR>How can I put this ... a beautiful woman is beautiful because
    of her assymetry ... because everything doesn&#39;t measure evenly ... she is
    &#34;optically&#34; beautiful ... but not &#34;symmetrically&#34; perfect. Does
    that make sense?

  body: Right, I&#39;m certainly going to rationalize the design in my own manner,
    whatever that will be. I don&#39;t know what other versions &#40;metal and digital&#41;
    had in terms of motivations anyway. <BR> <BR>The uneven-ness that I would like
    to avoid didn&#39;t stem from asymmetry

  body: '&#62; Can I revive this discussion? <BR> <BR>No, sorry, it&#39;s already
    been revived too often.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; the color is very uneven. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe it&#39;s an auto-trace. <BR> <BR>&#62; designing a revival of a face
    which has already been revived? <BR> <BR>I guess normally you want to diverge
    from all existing revivals, not just to avoid ethical issues, but also to deliver
    something more useful. The main things I think you should do are: make something
    that evokes &#34;rationalist&#34; royal France; make an italic that strikes a
    good balance between subservience, character and the rationalist ideology. <BR>

    I&#39;d discuss the ramifications of it with them should I ever get that far.
