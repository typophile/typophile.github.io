    is not likely to happen in a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "@SKUMATIK, I should have been more clear.\r\nYes, that was all custom Illustrator
    work by me for my business [[http://butterlabel.com]], and the site should launch
    officially \"shortly\".\r\n\r\nThe \"LABEL\" underneath is a massaging of [[http://typophile.com/user/1043|Mark
    Simonson]]'s [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html|Mostra]] typeface,
    which is beautiful. This was made before he relaunched Mostra as an OpenType face.
    Need to upgrade.\r\n\r\nAlso, Berthold's Akzidenz Grotesk on the flip side. The
    Light with Oldstyle Figures is snappy."
