body: "I scanned this from a Joyce Carol Oates book called Black Girl / White Girl
  (Fourth Estate, London 2006). It says inside the book, that it was set in Electra,
  but this additional text used for headings etc. doesn't look like any Electra I've
  found so far, so what is it? \r\nThe book used a lot of slash, starting from the
  name of the book to the page numbering."
