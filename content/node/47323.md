    Versal]] if you type in lower case for the less swashy versions of this all-caps
    alphabet. \r\nThere are a lot of these fonts, usually based on covers & title
    pages of late 19th & early 20th Century children's books. Others I can think of
    that aren't quite so close are:\r\n \r\nElphinstone\r\nEndoradine\r\nBenguiat
    EF Book Condensed\r\nInglenook Corner\r\n\r\n"
