body: "CheapProFonts is a fresh site which is dedicated to supplying high-quality
  OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting \"foreign\" languages (languages requiring
  more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\r\n\r\nIn
  this news release I present 14 fonts:\r\n- 5 from Ray Larabie\r\n- 4 from Brian
  Kent\r\n- 3 from Kevin King\r\n- 2 from Nick Curtis\r\nI am very grateful for these
  four designers letting me rework their freefonts for the professional market, and
  I am looking forward to showing you more of their lovely alphabet designs in the
  coming months :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-NEWS-08-Q1_5730.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  selection of fonts is pretty widespread - I'm trying to cater for a wide variety
  of needs for display fonts early on, and then broaden the selection within each
  category as the site expands.\r\n\r\nI find it a bit hard to believe it's only been
  3 months since I first got the idea for this site!\r\nIt has been a lot of work
  with the site itself, but I have managed to rework and release about one font a
  week - actually a bit more than I thought I could manage so early on. I'm pretty
  satisfied with how the site looks and works now, so I can spend even more time of
  the fonts - which is what YOU are looking forward to :)\r\n\r\nCheck our site for
  constant new releases.\r\n\r\nRoger S. Nelsson\r\n-- \r\n[[http://www.CheapProFonts.com]]\r\nHigh
  quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers
  with a small budget!"
