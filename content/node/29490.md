body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm having two issues as I work on my latest typeface.\r\n\r\n1.
  I upgraded my machine and a can't figure out one aspect of the interface I used
  to have. When I was moving a point it used to give me a readout of x, y and absolute
  distance. I cannot for the life of me find the toolbar that allows me to see this
  information. Any idea where this lives?\r\n\r\n2. I've built all the composite diacritic
  glyphs for the roman weight and a am now creating the bold version. When I weight
  up the master glyphs the composites change too (great!), but when I weight up the
  diacritics the composites don't reflect the change. Is there a button I need to
  click here? Surely there is a workaround?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRandy"

    composites and the wrong one got put into your new composite? FL5 defaults to
    the base diacritic unless you write your own script or do it manually with the
    \"add component\" command.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    ? ).\r\nThere is my problem on #2, thanks Chris.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on #1?\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "Clicking on vague icons was just the ticket! You won't find this toolbar
    under toolbars.\r\nWhilst in the glyph window, clicking on the ruler icon in the
    tools toolbar inserts the desired toolbar into the glyph window.\r\n\r\nSuper
    secret nested toobars. Brilliant!\r\nBack to regularly scheduled programming.\r\n\r\nThanks

    I mentioned it would be nice for the documentation somewhere to give all the keyboard
    FLab short cuts. I just now found again by trial and error the global guidelines
    switch (shift as you pull the guideline from the ruler.) I found it earlier, but
    then forgot. I couldn't find it in the documentation; maybe it's there, maybe
    not.  \r\n\r\nThere is lots of other stuff not documented. You said you would
    look into this. Any progress? "

  body: "Randy, thanks! \r\n\r\nNo, I hadn't seen it,that's the kind of thing I was
    looking for. \r\n\r\nThere are some not on the list, though. \r\n\r\nEg Shift-click
    a point or shift-drag around points adds the selected points to previous selection.
    Shift arrow moves a selection by 10 points. Also (apparently windows only) control-arrow
    moves a selection by 100 points. Control-alt-shift changes to meter mode in the
    glyph window on the PC at least. \r\n\r\nSo there must be more. A complete list
    from FontLab would be good!"
