  body: The script suspiciously looks like the swash version of LetterPerfect&#39;s
    <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/FRSQ/F_FRSQ-10005000.jhtml"> Florens</A>.
    Long time I&#39;ve seen this one in action, so I wouldn&#39;t know if these specific
    letterforms are present in the font. Adobe has an OpenType version, so these should
    be included. Couldn&#39;t find a character map though.

  body: Though the serif looks very familiar, its name keeps eluding me. If you fail
    to get it identified, I&#39;d recommend <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/percolator/">
    Percolator</A> or <A HREF="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=89"> Democratica</A>
    which are very similar in atmosphere and IMHO much better quality designs.

  body: Is it? I stand corrected. I haven&#39;t seen Zapfino&#39;s alternate characters
    in action yet, so I wouldn&#39;t know. Still no news from the serif...

  body: I wouldn&#39;t be so embarassed, Hrant. It&#39;s not exactly like it&#39;s
    the font design of the century IMHO. Look at that lowercase &#34;r&#34;.

  body: In this text-based world, a well placed emoticon &#40;i.e.  ;-&#41;  <BR>goes
    a long way. <BR> <BR>&#40;As a side note, I also love how an emoticon can finish  <BR>a
    parenthetical statement. Just like this one =&#41; <BR> <BR>

    put this type into some sort of context? Maybe a specimen?
