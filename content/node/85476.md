  body: "I like where your going. I have a personal rule where I will not use free
    fonts. Free fonts tend to be more commonly used. Consider spending a bit on some
    fonts. In my opinion it is a small price to pay.\r\n\r\nI'm not very good with
    script fonts so I'm not much help there. I don't use them very often. You could
    try Kabel for the san serif font. It is one of my favorites. The bar on the lowercase
    e slopes up similar to Caviar or Josephine. I also love the lowercase g.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kabel_4659.jpg]"

    commercial use is the Respective font.\r\n\r\nBut your right about free, i'm not
    finding the font that just goes pow!\r\n\r\nI may go with a San serif font and
    add flourishes for glam/feminine touch.\r\n\r\nI like the font you posted thx."

    I'm not as skilled in finding fonts as the members here :(\r\n\r\nThat font speaks
    for itself. I shows class, style everything I've been trying to find.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANK
    YOU SO MUCH!\r\n\r\nQuestion Kentlew with this font should I add any swirls under
    it like this: (sure you will say no that it cheapens the font but need advice)\r\n\r\nJust
    examples: \r\nMaybe put the swoop under the name or the luscious etc tagline and
    no swoops or decorative since the script font you recommended speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nthx"

  body: "I suggest capitalizing the characters in the word hair. Lowercase letters
    and black letter fonts should never be tracked out like that. Frederick Goudy
    has a famous saying that anyone that would letterspace blackletter would steal
    sheep. For the gradients I like the tan much more than the pink. I also suggest
    finding another way to incorporate hair rather than the swirl on the i.\r\n\r\nAlso
    consider removing the box. I have seen that done a lot. An alternative treatment
    to the word hair could be making it the same size as Anilia but just another weight
    of the font. Similar to the treatment of [[http://www.suzeorman.com/|Suze Orman's]]
    logo."

  body: Wasn't that comment about lower-case? Blackletter uses letterspacing for emphasis.
    Mind, I have seen this in whiteletter, too, in cases where I suspect the printer
    did not have italic or bold.

    & Find Out How Type Works by Erik Spiekermann and E.M. Ginger.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn
    1936, Frederic Goudy was in New York to receive an award for excellence in type
    design. Upon accepting a certificate, he took one look at it and declared that
    \u2018Anyone who would letterspace black letter would steal sheep.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nI
    can't remember where but I recall hearing somewhere that the original statement
    was about black letter and went on to refer to lowercase as well."

  body: "I've been researching and brainstorming on how to incorporate something that
    symbolizes hair and I just can't figure out anything that's different. So the
    swoop is out of desperation. Most hair companies go crazy with flourishes and
    I just don't want a whimsical look. I want crisp to the point design. \r\n\r\nI
    put \"hair\" in lowercase because I really wanted to put emphasis on the name
    of the product \"Anila\". I do however like how Suzie Ormans logo looks thanks
    for that idea.\r\n\r\nI know that I don't want to use a or have a vector drawn
    of a woman with flowing hair, I see so many companies using vectors of women with
    swirling hair.\r\n\r\nI guess if I capitalize \"hair\" I can add a swirl going
    through the lettering or is that blah?\r\n\r\nThx for the suggestions I appreciate
    it greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    lower case. One thing I do know is that (German) blackletter relies on letterspacing

  body: "I like the type treatment but the way the hair is implemented is a bit much.
    Consider doing something similar but having the hair element underline the text
    instead of having it becoming the i. That would make the logo more compact.\r\n\r\nThe
    second gray may cause difficulties when printing. For example, if you got this
    embroidered on shirts the cost would go up for a second color thread.\r\n\r\nI
    like the idea of using different font weights. In addition to making Anila bold
    the word hair could be light and Anila could remain the weight it is. Just an
    idea. It is one of those things where you just have to try it out and see what
    works. "
