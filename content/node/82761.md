  body: "What's the poetry about? What style? Metered? Free verse? How long are the
    lines?\r\n\r\nI've pasted below my comment on a recent thread asking for fonts
    for resumes. I think the idea is applicable here, too.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nChoose
    a legible serif face with a hint of character that subtly conveys something about
    your personality. I don't really understand questions of this kind, because the
    question shouldn't be \"what's a good font for a resume?\" Any (readable, probably
    serif) font is good for a resume. The question is \"what font fits my personality
    and image?\" A resume is about subtly branding yourself, so choose something with
    a hint of you in it. I've recently designed some resumes for friends. I've used
    different typefaces for all of them. This reminds me a bit of the recent post
    on \"what's a good font for a novel?\" The only real answer to that is \"what's
    the novel about?\" So \u2014\r\n\r\n1. Of course the medium (resume, novel, etc.)
    determines to some extend what sorts of faces will work. You wouldn't set a novel
    entirely in Zapfino (usually), because the properties of a novel, such as type
    size and length of text, don't lend themselves to that font, and vice versa. In
    the case of resumes, the practical limitations are that it should be easily readable;
    have a professional, calm appearance, and have enough variants (or other faces)
    to serve the hierarchy. BUT \u2014\r\n\r\n2. The point of your design isn't to
    allude to the idea of a resume, and all the associations that entails, but to
    allude to yourself. You're not designing the medium, you're designing the message.
    So your question is really, What do I want my resume to say about me?\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nSo,
    in this case, yes, Dolly is a wonderful font, but it may or may not fit the tone
    of the poetry you're designing. Any font can work for poetry, provided it fits
    the theme of the text. If you'd like to give us some details on the feel you're
    going for, I would be happy to come up with some font suggestions.\r\n\r\nJosh"
