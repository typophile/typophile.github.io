body: I&#39;min the last stage of finishing up a type family for a customer. Most
  of the work was made in Mac OS9.2.2 and Fontographer. <BR>I just switched to OSX,
  and  I&#39;ve installed the Non-FPU version of Fog, and use it in Classic mode from
  OSX. <BR>It&#39;s however really slow. Is there anyone who <BR>have any tips on
  how to speed it up. <BR> <BR>I know I probably should finish the work in Fontlab,
  but there&#39;s no time to learn how to work in FL right now. I need to be finished
  this week. <BR> <BR>Anyone who could help me ? <BR> <BR>/peter

  body: 'The simplest the better, so switching to OS9 to finish the work appears to
    be the better way. <BR> <BR>Theres also some &#34;special features&#34; &#40;hum&#41;
    of OSX you can disable to speed it up: <BR>-Hide the dock and disable scaling
    of icons. <BR>-Use a small handy utility called Shadow Killer who disable the
    shadows. &#40;even if I know that OS9 windows don&#39;t have shadows&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Good luck. <BR> <BR>greg.'

  body: Another thing you can do that will help when running FOG in Classic is to
    set your monitor from millions of colors to thousands of colors.   <BR>  <BR>But,
    the best solution I&#39;ve come up with so far is to run FOG on an older Mac running
    OS9 and not try to run it in Classic any more than necessary. That leaves me free
    to do my other work in OSX on my newer machine without having to reboot to switch
    OSs or put up with Classic every time I want to work on a font. &#40;My next step
    will be to get one of those monitor sharing switches so I don&#39;t need to have
    two monitors on my desk and can use my favorite monitor all the time.&#41;  <BR>  <BR>This
    is not as impractical as it may sound. Old Macs are cheap and FOG runs like lightning
    on anything over 50mhz. And, if you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ve got at least one
    old klunker lying around your basement or closet eager to be called back into
    service. :-&#41;

  body: Changing to thousands colours actually helped a little. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    have the room to set up my other machines, well maybe the Powerbook, but the I
    need a keyboard for the shortcuts, and also all that noise. But it&#39;s a good
    idea. <BR> <BR>Another good thing for when I&#39;ve learned to master Fontlab
    would be a  FOG  to VFB  converter for all those extra fog files. I usually have
    at least 10 different FOG&#39;s lying around for just a weight, with alternates
    and stuff. <BR> <BR>Someone with programing skills out there? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>

    came up recently on the [T-D] list. According to Yuri &#40;lead FL programmer&#41;,
    the FOG file format has never been made available. Presumably, this is why FL
    doesn&#39;t import FOG files directly. His suggestion was to export as Type 1
    from FOG and open that from FL. He also said that FOG metrics and kerning assistance
    files are recognized by FL.

  body: I must have missed that thread. <BR>Exporting is ok for one typeface, but
    I guess all of us must have at least a few hundreds of FOG files laying around.
    <BR>It&#39;s really time for Macromedia to release the file format. <BR> <BR>BTW
    does anyonewho has a copy of Robofog, know if it is slow in Classic mode, just
    as regular Fontographer??
