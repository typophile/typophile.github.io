  KABK, and I'm working on a project which is to develop my own logo.\r\n\r\nI want
  it to have a very actual look, yet with a good sense of tradition. Nimble yet sturdy.\r\n\r\nI
  found the Silom a quite appropriate typeface, very 'electronic' but quite round.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/medwarsig_5481.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think of it?"

    I don't understand the significance of the rz in merz but the rotation/reflection
    falls down because the r won't let you do that. I don't know if you could find
    a better typeface, but I suspect a simple monoline would perform better something
    like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/variable/\">Variable</a>.
    As it stands I am not getting any sturdy tradition, let alone nimbleness.\r\nTim"
