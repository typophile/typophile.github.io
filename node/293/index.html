<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello, I am a newbie here and a newbie to the whole font creating thing, so hello everyone, and I've been struggling with a following issue for weeks now: <br>I was given a bunch of .fog's created on Mac to convert and generate PC TTF fonts. I also wanted to make Italic versions of them, which I made with the simple Element:Transform:Shear -12. They converted fine, but I have a problem with family building. I generate two TTF's: the original one and the italic one, setting the Font Info:General attributes respectively to Font and Font -Italic. When I try to add them via ATM Deluxe I use for managing all my fonts, it would show up only one of the two fonts. ID changing didn't help. Am I missing something or is there something wrong w/ the Fontographer itself? Is there any other tool/program I could use for such conversions/modifications?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I cheat this by putting the entire name in the first window as Font-Italic and nothing in the second one. <br> <br>Stuart :D</div>

<div class=commentbody>You're not able to see the two fonts only on ATM? <br>Can you see both fonts on Explorer, for example? <br>If not, Fontographer probably generated the two <br>fonts with a same file name.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I can see both fonts in explorer. They don't show up only on ATM. <br> <br>If I put the entire font names in the first window, the system won't percept them as a family, so I won't be able to use the italic style on my font in DTP programs or anywere else.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Element:Transform:Shear -12 <br> <br>Many "users" wouldn't notice (at least not consciously), but I assume you realize that mechanical transformations like that produce inferior results. If you look at almost any italic (even ones called oblique that maintain the Roman structures, but especially so-called "true" italics that are totally different than the Roman) you'll see that at the absolute very least there has been some manual post-processing, but very often the whole thing is redrawn. Also, the larger the angle you use, the greater the distortion. <br> <br>At the very least, call the resultant fonts "Oblique", not "Italic". <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> mechanical transformations like that produce inferior results <br> <br>I am aware of that. However, I wanted to make those italics in the 'quick and easy' way, as it is the voluntary part of my job. Besides, the font is sans-serif grotesk (like Helvetica, I hope I got the terminology right), so simply shearing it does not do it much harm, and I was told that -12 is the optimal angle for such transformation. <br> <br>Anyway I'm in trouble, when it comes to discussions like this, as there are like 2-3 font professionals in my country which is not that big itself, and font design is not taught in schools, so I guess forums like these are the only place to learn things. <br> <br>I will keep in mind the Oblique suggestion, thanks <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>You should at least "insert points at extremes", <br>after slanting/skewing your font. IIRC, you can <br>do it using the Clear Paths command (Ctrl+Shift+C <br>for PCs). <br> <br>Anyway, I don't know what is going wrong with <br>your ATM. I tried generating italic fonts at home <br>last night and it worked just fine. <br> <br> <br><i>>it would show up only one of the two fonts. <br>>ID changing didn't help.</i> <br> <br>Which one is showing up? The regular, I suppose. <br>What do you mean by "ID changing"? <br>Just some questions to see if we can help you. ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Which one is showing up? The regular, I suppose. <br>Yes, the regular. <br> <br>> What do you mean by "ID changing"? <br>In the Generate Fonts dialog there's a font ID#, which is generated automatically, I suppose. I've been told that if something doesn't work, ie. the fonts not being generated the right way, altering it manually often helps. (It is lame, I know <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0>. Anyway, I should reinstall my Fontographer/ATM and then take another look, I guess.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>Anyway, I should reinstall my Fontographer/ATM <br>>and then take another look, I guess.</i> <br> <br>I think this is not very recommendable for a trouble like <br>yours. Specially for ATM. Besides not being recommendable, <br>I don't think reinstalling your softwares will solve the problem. <br> <br>Is the italic font correctly generated? Check out with Windows <br>default font showing (just double-click your font files on Explorer). <br> <br>Btw, you don't need ATM to install TT fonts on Windows. <br>Try installing via Control Panel> Fonts.</div>
