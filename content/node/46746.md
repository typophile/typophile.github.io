  from <em>History in Small Spaces</em> the upcoming exhibition of large format archival
  pigment prints July 17-21, TypeCon 2008, Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\nThe desire for
  getting along in polite society have long tempted the fancy of aspiring souls, following
  are the musings of beautiful and enchanting young Undine Spragg, newcomer to the
  travails of the cosmopolitan dream:\r\n\r\n\"She went to the window, and drawing
  back its many layers of lace gazed eastward down the long brown-stone perspective.
  \ Beyond the Park lay Fifth Avenue\u2013and Fifth Avenue was where she wanted to
  be!\r\n\r\nShe had read in the 'Boudoir Chat' of one of the Sunday papers that the
  smartest women were using the new pigeon-blood note-paper with white ink; and rather
  against her mother's advice she had ordered a large supply, with her monogram in
  silver.  It was a disappointment, however, to that Mrs. Fairford wrote on the old-fashioned
  white sheet, without even a monogram\u2013simply her address and telephone number.\"\u2013Edith
  Wharton, <em>The Custom of the Country</em>, 1913, The Library of America edition
  published by arrangement with Charles Scribner and Sons."
