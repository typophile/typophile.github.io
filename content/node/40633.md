  body: Check the back or colophon. [[Dot dot dot]] has used new original typefaces
    in their last few issues.

  body: To be honest, this looks like a hastily extrapolated bold weight to me. Not

  body: "I also thought that Stephen. I added a 0.1pt stroke to News Plantin and it
    took on a similar feeling. If this is the case do you have any idea of what the
    original font is, or can you suggest something similar?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: If blobby is what you want, you can get there by adding a stroke to <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/adobe_caslon/?sample_text=Parnet%E2%80%99s%20left%20shoulder&sample_size=36">Caslon</a>.
