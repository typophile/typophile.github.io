  in InDesign, Illustrator etc.\r\n\r\nIf I try to recall what I did recently was
  to fix startpoints-macro from Adobe. There was also an update in InDesign which
  i run. Nothing else have I done, except from exporting the fonts in the same way
  I always do.\r\nThe glyphs show themselves in FontLab, but not anymore in applications.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  experience this problem? It\u2019s driving me crazy."

  body: "Ok, i was to quick here. Problem solved.\r\n\r\nVery strange, but when I
    changed the startpoints manually on the missing letters, they did show up again.
    Hmm, strange that the macro did this...\r\nAnyone knows what happened?"
