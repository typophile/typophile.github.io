  and Stet originally came from. I know this is more of an editorial question but
  since most of us deal with these words way too often, I thought I'd give this list
  a try. \r\nShe was telling me that Stet and TK originated in Germany. But I'm German
  and I really don't know what those terms would translate to.\r\nDo you?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJana"

    seemed too ambiguous or easy to overlook). It has been in use for the 40-some
    years I have worked in publishing (at least), and I suspect it is American.\r\n\r\nLike
    the use of \u201Clede\u201D for the lead paragraph in a (usually) newspaper story,
    it may also be a sort of insider tradition.\r\n\r\n\u201CStet\u201D \u2014 the
    writer\u2019s defense against overly zealous copy editors \u2014 is even older,
    and I believe it comes from Latin.\r\n\r\n \r\n--Kathleen"
