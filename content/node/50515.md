  design movement, from 1890s till present.\r\n\r\nThere are 7 major design styles/movements
  in history from 1890 to today. They are:\r\n1.\tVictorian Era \r\n2.\tArt Nouveau
  Style \r\n3.\tModern Movement \r\n4.\tFifties' American Kitsch \r\n5.\tPost-modern
  Rebellion\r\n6.\tThe Contemporary Look \r\n7.\tThe Digital Age\r\n\r\nNow, I am
  concentrating on the digital age. Is there any articles about this movement's influences,
  introductions, or maybe typography in the digital age?"
