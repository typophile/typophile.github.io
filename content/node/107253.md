  Museum]] today, and I quite dig the large display serif type in the headline, that
  is in \"Ballets Su\xE8dois\". (Not sure about the era classification on this one,
  the combo of chunky top serifs and variable stress is confusing. None of the more
  common transitionals, at least, unless it's an unusual cut of one of them.)\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have an idea what it could be? Digitised, I assume not? Anything close?\r\n\r\n"
