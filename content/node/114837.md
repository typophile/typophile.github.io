  body: "Mainly because of /M and even if /R leg is wrong, I would have started with
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Eurostile|Eurostile]], adding a leg to /P to recreate
    /R, moving /E crossbar downward and cutting the whole thing with a horizontal
    bar.\r\nInteresting alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/francker|Francker]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-qtype|QType]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/clonoid|Clonoid]],

    105]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/geom-graphic|Geom Graphic]]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    ...Or you rely on Fivos' expertise... Definitely Borg 9 which actually looks definitely
    coming from Eurostile."

  body: "Guys thank you sooo much, I went with Fvilanakis (Borg 9) it is exactly the
    same. I was pulling my hair yesterday.  \r\n\r\nRyuk thank you very much for the
    response and expertise, the font does seem to come from Eurostile and those are
    some really interesting fonts you shared.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you guys so much
    for taking the time to help out :)  "
