body: "Hello typo nuts!\r\n\r\nI've made this poster for a public debate society,
  called [[http://www.hvadharvigangi.dk/|Hvadharvigangi]] (\"What are we doing?\").
  It's meant to hang around in universities, libraries and the like to draw attention
  to the monthly debates. I've tried to convey a both fun and serious mood, because
  that defines the society: serious topics (this particular one: \"Genetics and ethics\"),
  presented and debated in a friendly and \"fun\" way.\r\n\r\nI recognize that you
  won't understand much of the text, because it's set in Danish. But I hope I can
  get some feedback on the overall layout/composition anyway. I'll be happy to explain
  anything in the text that might be important.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is the potential
  over-use of different sizes in type. It might appear a bit too messy. What do you
  think? The font is [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]
  + a wee [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=auto&id2=overview|Auto]]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  the header is my additional proposal for a <em>new logo</em>. So this element is
  important in it self. [[http://www.hvadharvigangi.dk/|Their old logo]] appears at
  the top of their webpage.\r\n\r\nI've attached 3 similar variations of the poster.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much!\r\n\r\np.s. The picture is just an example of how I want the future
  ones to be placed and cut. This one is completely irrelevant to genetics obvisouly"

  body: "Maybe you shoud try to emphasize a little more on the image usage in case
    you try to convey the fun and the serious part of a society. Although i think
    that there is an opposite heracy between the topic and the secondary informations
    such as date and time. I would suggest to use one primary, first level reading
    size for the topic, and a secondary, smaller one of all the secondary informations
    by using some other weights from HTF Knockout (combining for example HTF Knockout70
    FullWelterwt and HTF Knockout30 JuniorWelterwt, or using the Upercases in some
    cases also)\r\n\r\nP.S. What's the real size of the poster?\r\n\r\nDimitris Papazoglou[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Knockout_3789.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks a lot Dimitris! I might try to downsize the longer text on the right.
    I really like the the idea of having the date and time in big letters though,
    so I will see if I can keep that..\r\n\r\nThe poster will be in A4 size.\r\n\r\n\u2013
