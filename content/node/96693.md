  week I am going to take one long day to devote to exploring the world of fonts and
  typography. So, I'm looking for help in making this day a well-spent one. Can anyone
  offer some essential content, websites, old/new ideas to focus on? (other than this
  one, or ilovetypography.com)\r\n\r\nIf you had one day to explore and discover as
  much great stuff as possible....\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    the streets. The weather in your parts is looking decent for next week. Get to
    the largest city within a short drive or train ride (maybe even Buffalo, which
    once hosted a TypeCon, for a reason) and just roam around (maybe even getting
    lost for a while) in sponge mode (plus camera). And pick some small local newspapers
    while you're at it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    it all on the internet, personally, but I guess there is always the <a href="http://woodtype.org/">Hamilton
    Wood Type & Printing Museum</a>.

  body: "Well, this may be the first day of many spent appreciating type, but this
    first one is a single-day project I'm doing for work. (We each have been given
    a mission to take a day, do/learn/experience something we've always wanted to,
    and then report back on it the next day to our colleagues.) Yes, very good employer.\r\n\r\n@hrant,
    I think I may wander around the city (Toronto area) in the next couple of days,
    just as a primer, but for the project day I'd like more substance \u2013 some
    essential basics, what's happening in the field, big ideas right now, maybe some
    lunatic fringe activity, that sort of thing. \r\n"

  body: To make your day well spent, you need to prepare. So take an hour beforehand
    in the library to read a good book or two on the topic. No advice we could give
    you would be as good as you could give yourself once you combined knowledge of
    the subject with knowledge of your own interests.

    outside once I feel like I have some new info/perspectives to work with. \r\n\r\nWow,
    it's a bit of a kid-in-a-candy-store kind of anticipation. After reading through
    this site, I see it's a complex and passionate discipline. I'll keep reading.\r\n\r\nThanks
