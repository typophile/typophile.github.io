body: "I'm setting the Lady Macbeth 'Unsex me' speech and have been reading about
  the story (I didn't have the goodluck to study it at school) and getting a basic
  background before embarking on starting a full on project. I know this story was
  written in the 17th century and thought to remain true to the history would try
  to find a font relevant. I've looked at English Gothic fonts and though I've not
  done a hugely indepth search, the ones I've been looking at tend to come up as Blackletter
  which is not the route I wanted to go down, as I still want the speech to be fairly
  legible so thought a serif would be a better choice?  \r\n\r\nSo does anyone have
  any ideas that spring to mind? I've looked through typowiki at the history of the
  fonts listed there and Garamond and Bembo were two that had undergone changes but
  were around at the time (or so the numbers say :-))\r\n\r\nThis is more of a side
  project to my main project of documenting and mapping people using type so I'm trying
  to use the font and the way its set to give a voice to Lady Macbeth so her personality
  of ambition and hunger for power come through. I just need pointing in some direction
  as I feel like I've lost a wheel and I'm going around in circles :) \r\n\r\nAnyway
  help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBec "

    Caslon</a>. Caslon was making his first faces then, and they were revivals of
    the Dutch types in which I am guessing the first Shakespeare editions were published.
    It is not blackletter.  '

    will find many examples of 17th century printed works of Shakespeare's. I don't
    know whose types they were using, but they weren't Caslon's. He was from about
    a century later. They look Dutch to me. Something like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=janson\">Janson</a>
    would be about right."

    what is so useful about the web... results within minutes!\r\nRemember searching
    through mountains of books in the library (NYC Public Library on 42nd st. for
    me) for source and reference material?\r\n\r\nThe only MAJOR difference is close
    examination of printed material as opposed to screen resolution. You can't have
    everything... yet.\r\n"

    say Founders Caslon will look more like that early stuff, though it is too light.
    Another way to go would be with one of the Fleishman revivals, especially <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham">Farnham</a>.   '

  body: "If you want to evoke the time in which the play was first performed or published,
    then types like Caslon or a Fleischmann revival are all much too late and in completely
    the wrong style. Shakespeare's plays date from the very early years of the 17th
    century, and the typography of the first folio edition is essentially late renaissance
    or mannerist. See, for example, this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0393039854/ref=sib_rdr_zmin/002-4794442-0124013?p=S01G&j=1#reader-page\">facsimile
    page</a>.\r\n\r\nFerguson's <em>Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England</em> is
    worth consulting to get an idea of the kind of generic type popular in England
    during Shakespeare's lifetime. The elaborateness of style and quality of printing
    had advanced by the time of the first editions of Shakespeare's work, but Caslon's
    types are too close to the baroque to really substitute.\r\n\r\nAll that said,
    I think you could have much more fun responding typographically to the content
    of Lady M's soliloquy rather than to the historical period of its composition.\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">completely the wrong style\r\n\r\nOk, point taken. \r\n\r\nBut are there
    any digital types out there with the 'antique' look from that period? That's why
    I was thinking of Founders Caslon or the Farnham, which is so mannered as to look
    a little different and suggest another era. Ok they're historically wrong, but
    they can suggest 'antique'...\r\n\r\nBut as you say, maybe to suggest 'old' is
    not the best route anyway.\r\n  "

    in the medium weight for a little extra ruggedness (Elizabethan and Jacobean printing
    tended to be quite heavy).
