body: OK, let&#39;s spark some more convo. Takatak is a logo that was inspired by
  Katakana, created entirely with line art, then tweaked to achieved the desired thickness
  and roundness.The name is suggestive of chopsticks clicking against each other.
  It also means &#34;quickly&#34; in modern Greek and has become a vernacular expression
  amongst our friends here in Montreal. I thought I could maybe do some interesting
  and weird ligatures, something unexpected and strange, more akin to plant life than
  type. I was also planning on introducing some fun icons and illustrations, sort
  of like what you see on the background. As you can see, for the identity pieces,
  I have paired up the logo with one of my favorite fonts, Gia, by patric king. <BR>

  body: ' Pretty cool. <BR>I think you should concentrate a lot on the ligatures aspect
    of this - people &#42;love&#42; to customize display settings - it makes them
    feel personally closer to the results. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Yeah...except that I am absolutely clueless about how to actualize a font,
    ie: Fontographer and/or Sprite, etc. I learned the basics of Fontographer but
    I think for ligatures your would probably need either a script or some kind of
    code to be able to have strange and random ligatures...what do you think? <BR>

    set as well as a seperate  <BR>font file with the ligature set. <BR> <BR>Just
    do your users a favor and include a PDF of  <BR>the character map. <BR> <BR>//joe '

  body: ' Yep. Though of that. Because, let&#39;s face it, not that many people &#40;even
    within the design community&#41; really care or know that much about ligatures.
    But it would be fun to end up with a randomized typeface...although I guess you&#39;d
    need a plugin or something...hmm...maybe not. <BR>Sorry, thinking out loud here.

    it requires a lot of extra work, and a type of work that&#39;s a lot more like
    computer programming than graphic design. <BR> <BR>The closest example similar
