  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, <BR>this forum is read by people all over the world. This gives us the opportunity of being able to combine our knowlegde. For example our knowlegde about language. <BR> <BR>I am speaking here about kerning. Everyone who has touched or dived into the world of kerning knows this is a very difficult theme. <BR> <BR>I would like to use this thread to put up a list of all usable character and sign combinations which are being used all over the world and should be incorporated into the kerning of fonts. &#40;of course, only if the design needs it&#41; <BR> <BR>Theorectically there are more than 600,000 possible combinations, which can be made with a standard font &#40;latin 1 font encoding&#41;. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to know what pairs don&#39;t make any sense? <BR> <BR>Such a list would be a big help for every font designer. <BR> <BR>----Jacques</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jacques -- <BR> <BR>At one point during the development of Whitman, I spent several hours with various dictionaries -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, and Dutch -- to identify accent combinations in either the first or second positions. I was looking for possible cap/lc kerns. Not being at all fluent in most of these languages, I&#39;m not sure which words might have been completely unlikely to show up as the first word in a sentence, but I got into an obsessive mode. <BR> <BR>I was also interested in finding which accented characters apeared in initial or terminal positions, in which languages, to consider whether they required kerning with various quotation marks. <BR> <BR>It was an interesting exercise. I can try to find my list somewhere for you, when I get a chance. <BR> <BR>I believe John Hudson has developed some extensive kerning lists along these lines. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kerning in Adobe OpenType Pro fonts contains many pairs which couldn&#39;t appear in a real written text. There is a limited amount of Czech accented letters, like ccaron, scaron or uring. These characters are used in Czech word only and cannot be combined with French / Italian etc. letters. So the combinations like Tcaron&#43;acircumflex or Lslash&#43;Yacute are absurd. I think it would be great to create linguistic-based kerining pairs. There could be several lists of pairs - for Western, Eastern European, Cyrillic and other encodings. &#40;May be the problem is, that Adobe OpenType Pro fonts simply kerns letters T&#43;a with all possible accents.&#41;</div>

But, while this would be a disadvantage in a typical Type 1 font &#40;because bloated kerning tables slow down processing&#41;, since Adobe OT fonts take full advantage of class-based kerning, these combinations take virtually no extra code &#40;depending, of course, on how the classes are defined&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, in the case of OT fonts, I think more might be better -- i.e., better to be thorough and have a few absurd combinations, than not to have accented pairs. Also, since it takes no real overhead, casting a wide net is probably a lot more efficient than trying to analyze every conceivable language and identify only the &#40;currently&#41; possible combinations.  <BR> <BR>In OT, that is -- with class-based kerning. Not in Type 1.  Jacques&#39;s list will be useful for Type 1 kerning. <BR>  <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to expand on Kent&#39;s comment, removing those &#34;nonsense&#34; pairs would in fact make the font larger, when using class kerning! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll explain how it works with only a little simplification. There is a matrix of left vs. right classes. Any exceptions are additional line items that must precede that matrix. If an exception is necessary to avoid a collision or because the kerning result was poor, then we&#39;ll try to do that. But suppressing &#34;nonsense&#34; combinations would simply add more exceptions, and bloat the font, without making it any better--it&#39;s not like they hurt anything. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Filip, <BR> <BR>&#62; I think it would be great to create linguistic-based kerining pairs. <BR> <BR>This could be a solution, but it st more practical to have fonts, which includes all languages included in a western type 1 font. Otherwise you&#39;ll end up with maybe 5 or even 10 different fonts. This is doomed to go wrong. Imagine your font is being used by a multinational, operating in the US and in france.  <BR> <BR>--Jacques</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&#62;Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but if one works with classes, like phinney explained, isn&#39;t there a chance of becoming colliding glyphs or exaggerated kerning?</i> <BR> <BR>I have not delved into class kerning yet, so I speak only form a theoeretical understanding, not practical experience. But the theory is that if you have equivalent sidebearings in your base letter and the rest of the members in the class, then what&#39;s good for the base is good for the rest. There are, of course, cases where this breaks down -- for instance the kern for Va may not work for V{agrave} &#40;depending upon the design of your grave&#41;. That&#39;s when you&#39;d create an exception, I suppose. The other option might be to define a second class of a-like glyphs which doesn&#39;t include some accented a&#39;s specifically for kerning with overhanging capitals -- that sort of thing. But, of course, too much of this -- either exceptions or extra classes -- starts to enlarge the font and also the work, almost defeating the purpose of using classes. <BR> <BR>Class kerning is a powerful tool, but it requires planning and careful logic in setting up your classes, as well as designing your glyphs. It seems like it would work better with consistent, regular designs than with idiosyncratic, irregular designs. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>
