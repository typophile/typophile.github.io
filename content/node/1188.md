body: ditto to Grants comment. userbility goes down. <BR>As far as uniqueness is concerned.
  Well new &#34;s&#34; is ceratinly interesting but in my opinion not complete. the
  center slant on the &#34;s&#34; is thicker than the slant the &#34;e&#34;, &#34;g&#34;  and
  &#34;a&#34;. I am not sure if it is intentional or not but it looks too thick especially
  in the bold weight. I am also noticing the top counter in the lc &#34;g&#34; is
  sitting kind of low and not centered. This I suspect may be intentional.  <BR>I
  tell you Joseph, I am a sucker for unusual forms but these days  <BR>I find myself
  regretting certain recent purchases &#40;Sophia from Fontsmith as well as Friendly
  from Die-Gestalten&#41; because of userbility issues. <BR>I guess Stephan might
  be right in some ways.  <BR>A designer/agency may purchase the new version but will
  it be used a lot-I am guessing properly not. If one of your goals is exposure of
  Pill in award winning design the i would suggest going back to basics.  <BR> <BR><img

    The <BR>whole design is more congruous now. <BR> <BR>Some other things I noticed:
    <BR> <BR>- Some of your numerals seem a little long - the &#39;7&#39; especially,
    as <BR>it descends below the other descenders. <BR> <BR>- Your small caps are
    the perfect height. Nice. <BR> <BR>- Is the kerning done? The apos-s pair is a
    little tight. <BR> <BR>- The difference between the comma/apos/quote form and
    the <BR>square period is just fine until a semicolon appears. Maybe the <BR>period
    can get a tad smaller? Closer to stem width. DIN&#39;s, in <BR>particular, is
    much lighter.'

    not fond of it in a body application, but I would certainly use it in headlines.
    I think it is very unique. <BR> <BR>Ole and Grant have the same readability issues
    that I have. I purchased Fedra a few months ago, and as much as I love using the
    font at small sizes, anything above 12 point starts to be problematic. The &#34;uniqueness&#34;
    of certain letters becomes a distraction. I would hate to see that happen with
    this font. &#40;I noticed recently that Peter Bilak is offering an alternate version
    of Fedra that removes some &#34;features&#34; of the old font.&#41; <BR>

    <BR><i>The center slant on the &#34;s&#34; is thicker than the slant the &#34;e&#34;,
    &#34;g&#34; and &#34;a&#34;.</i> <BR> <BR>Now that someone has pointed out the
    thicker centre stroke of the &#39;s&#39;, perhaps this is part of the reason that
    I preferred the traditional form. In the context of the sample that Ole posted,
    the &#39;s&#39; seems a bit off - not much mind you. Making the thickness of the
    similar diagonals in those characters more consistant would help the congruity
    - at least from my perspective.

  body: ' <BR> <BR> I agree that there is something not quite right with the s&#39;s,
    though I think I&#39;m on the right track. It&#39;s true that the font behaves
    completely differently with the funky S&#39;s. It supports my theory that the
    character of a font can be changed drastically with a smattering of alternates
    &#40;see Uncial New in the Critique:Blackletter/Uncial category&#41;. I really
    wish OpenType software &#40;i.e. InDesign&#41; would let type designers name their
    own features, which would then come up under the font menu. Why have a &#34;Titling
    Alternates&#34; check box when the font really needs a &#34;Funky S&#34; feature?
    I can understand why standard naming conventions would be desirable for standard
    features &#40;smcp&#41;, but why won&#39;t the software recognize non-standard
    features? The question seems so obvious to me that it makes me angry. <BR> <BR>The
    cross-bar on the new s&#39; are too wide. Good call. As for Hrant&#39;s last comment:
    too terse : &#41; For now, however, I think that the funky s will have to live
    in an OpenType category like titling alternates, or something like that. <BR>

  body: I think we&#39;re really just talking about stylistic preferences now. Some
    like the new s, some don&#39;t. I personally dislike it &#40;rather strongly in
    fact&#41;. The reason is the techno reference Stephen mentions above. I think
    this S treatment pushes the whole face too far in that direction both in display
    and in text. I don&#39;t know what else to say. It&#39;s actully makes is less
    buyable for me. <BR> <BR>But the fact that some do like it suggests to me that
    you should include one or the other as an alternate. Obviously, I would choose
    the old S for the main set, but you might highlight the Alternate S in promotional

    <i>the website. You can&#39;t rely on people to read for that info.</i> <BR> <BR>Very
    true. Our bottleneck right now is the time it takes to properly create custom,
    family-specific displays for all of the new &#40;and existing&#41; fonts. Our
    goal over the next dozen weeks or so is to replace our generic &#39;Divergently&#39;
    displays within the Umbrella collection with showings that are unique to each
    face.  <BR> <BR>Eventually, these improvements would continue through the most
    popular typefaces from the other foundries as well. Right now, we are really limited
    by our internal creative resources. We are definitely concerned with displaying
    the typefaces in the most appropriate and complimentary manner as possible. <BR>
    <BR>Frankly, the better it looks, the more you sell. <BR> <BR>&#62; <i>Also, will
    Veer be adding PDF specimines any time soon?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes, and hopefully soon.
    This is not something that we can easily accommodate with the product database
    solution we are currently tied to. However, we are in the process of finishing
    up a brand-spanking new system that will allow us to add external data types &#40;like
    custom PDF specimens and links to designers website, for instance&#41; to individual
    product pages. <BR> <BR>Not yet, but soon. <BR> <BR>Another thing we are going
    to address is the ability to view complete dynamically-generated character set,
    a la MyFonts. Oh, and a preference that maintains a consistent, user-defined text
    string for all of your Flont samples is also going to be available shortly.'
