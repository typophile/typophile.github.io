    Sut Ralston NF]] by Nick Curtis. You could also have a look to the [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Nicks_Fonts|rest
    of his collection]], [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead Fonts]] and the
    [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=115|Fancy > Retro]] section at DaFont.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    just got it. I'd overlooked LHF's. That's [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/rossantiqueroman.php|Ross
    Antique Roman LHF]]."
