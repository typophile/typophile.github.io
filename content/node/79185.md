body: "i think its really interesting to know what typeface designers use on their
  CV, it's almost like asking what typeface are you?\r\n\r\nI use Adobe Caslon in
  mine.\r\n\r\nI was asked to redesign a CV for a friend(a very interesting project
  by the way, it was actually quite difficult and very fun), and I thought of using
  Officina because she works in a bank and I expect her cv will always be printed
  on some cheap laser printer, I think Officina looks good no matter how cheap the
  printer is.\r\n\r\nwhat about you?\r\n\r\n"

    unless you are specifically applying for a graphic design job, i think all resumes
    end up being ugly Arial and Times .doc files. "

  body: "Comic Sans for headers and all-caps Arial bold for body copy with really
    tight leading. Numbers get Papyrus for a bit of \"authentic historical flavor\".\r\n\r\nIn
    all seriousness, I actually haven't needed one yet, but off the top of my head,
    maybe Frutiger family for headers and a Garamond for body copy? "

  body: "I am a fan of humanistic sans, which I find maybe for most of designers here
    already a bit dated, but in a non-designer environment still a fresh appearance.
    Therefore I make us of Frutiger. The MS rip-off \u201CSegoe UI\u201D is sufficient
    too. The new Office font Calibri is too \u201Cbundled\u201D and round. Most people
    I know use Arial. \r\nAs a serif font I read the recommendations of Georgia, Palatino
    and especially for conservative business Century Schoolbook. \r\nPersonally I
    find with a serif, it should not be too decorative and I prefere a large x-height,
    as a size of 10 point (not smaller than 9 I would say) should still be readable.
    Good candidates to fit this brief are in my opinion Droid Serif and Utopia. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "One problem I have often run into is when s/he want\u2019s to update it themselves
    in the future when I\u2019m not around and they don\u2019t have your fonts or
    software. It\u2019s possible to pull it using Times and Arial in Word. It's not
    the font, it\u2019s how you use it. While presentation counts and you want a salient
    typographic hierarchy that is congruent with the informational hierarchy, there
    is a law of diminishing returns when it comes to pushing type around on a page
    for a document such as a CV. At the end of the day, content is more important
    than form. < /soap_box >"

    if you can, why not have the best of both worlds? Obviously the fact that I designed
    her CV is not going to get her a job she is not qualified for, but I like to think
    that having a well designed CV with perfect typography would help in someway,
    but at the end of the day I'm a graphic designer so I might be a little biased.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I started using Skolar for papers at school and have been dissapointed - using
    it in MS Word it seems to be too dark/heavy. I really love the shapes of the letters
    (apart from the lower case "a") but wish it was a little lighter.
