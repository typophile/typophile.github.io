  body: 1&#41; That greeen squiggle is trying to be read. <BR>2&#41; What about incorporating
    the guy&#39;s freckles &#40;those spots on his face&#41; subtly into the logo
    somehow? It IS a personal site. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'I am enjoying this. Nice idea.\ <BR> <BR>Some observations: <BR> <BR>It took
    me some time to see the car in the design, which doesn&#39;nt bother me. I think
    I wanted the green stroke to be a word &#40;zoom?&#41; <BR> <BR>But once I saw
    the car, I enjoyed it. <BR> <BR>The car is driving downhill, could the weight
    of the mark become more stable if the car were leveled? <BR> <BR>This idea may
    be ruinous, but put motion lines in the bottom of D for speed? <BR> <BR>Also,
    concerning the weights of the letters, the D,O and O increasingly stick out to
    me more and more as I look at it. Reweight? <BR> <BR>'

  body: Try making the nes either a tint of gray or make it the green or the car doesn&#39;t
    read as a car. Overall I love the loose feel, its like racing.

  body: Love it, but I too had a hard tiem seeing the car at first. I&#39;m not sure
    what can be done to make it a touch more obvious &#40;without being overt&#41;,
    but I&#39;d explore it, if I were you. Keep it lose, keep it subtle, but maybe
    try to bring that car out just a &#42;touch&#42; more.
