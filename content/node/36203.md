  and How it got that Way\" is. By Bill Bryson.\r\n\r\nThe only link I can provide
  right now (my scanner broke) is here: http://www.amazon.com/Mother-Tongue-Bill-Bryson/dp/0380715430/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-4926725-7749748?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187303271&sr=1-1
  go to SEARCH INSIDE and then EXERPT. Thanks :) Sorry about the spelling / grammer.
  I'm at an Internet Cafe :) and my time's about to run out!"

    [[Bitstream]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=century+751">Century
    751</a>).

    'f' also seems a bit off. My guess would be Caledonia, or New Caledonia.\r\n\r\n-

    to Punchcut folks: Something odd happened with my post preceding this. I had a
    double-post earlier, and when I tried to edit it to say '[double post -- sorry]'
    it was moved down on the page, below Michael Boyer's last post. So I went in and
    edited it again with my comment about the Berthold Caledonia font. However, it
    was still treated like an old post, and the thread stayed down in the list, showing
    Michael's as the last entry on the Type ID Board listing, but showing my post
    as the last one on this page. Sounds like a software 'bug' to me.]\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Mike, I can hardly believe that you could do it just from the scan. I took
    the book from the library and checked with a loupe; it is printed small and on
    poor paper. Here is the question mark, which is quite characteristic, and also
    how the g's came out. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/proof_6299.gif]

  body: "Michael, I admire your determination to get the absolute answer. Did you
    conclude that it was the Berthold version? Looking at the samples in the FontBook,
    I don't think I could feel sure, based on those three glyphs, although the descender
    comment favors the Berthold, I think.\r\n\r\nI think the virtue of the Serif Font
    ID Guide, which is what I used to make the ID, is that it depends on structural
    features first to narrow the choices, and then lets you look at, and compare,
    samples to use your own eyes to make the final choice. This time it worked pretty
    well. (It doesn't always)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is my feeling they just made a photoreduction and I have no idea  if the reduction
    process, plus the bad quality of the paper, may account for the differences. \r\n\r\nMichel

    the FontBook98, so you will perhaps take my word, that the Berthold sample is
    more like the Bitstream than either of the Linotypes.\r\n\r\nI think we are agreeing
    that it is NOT New Caledonia or Linotype's metal version of Caledonia (from Lawson's
