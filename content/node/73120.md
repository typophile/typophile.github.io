  body: "Could it be uni224f, \"Difference Between\"?\r\n\r\nI have next to zero knowledge
    of cardiology and/or mathematics, but I've never seen this either. What does it
    mean here? Just \"beats at\" or something more specific to fibrillation? Does
    it appear anywhere else? Is there a table of symbols?\r\n\r\n<em>Edit/Afterthought:
    maybe it's a clever representation of a P wave on an EKG? :)</em>"

  body: "I think it just means \"approximately equal to\" -- an alternative to the
    probably more commonly used \u2248. (But there may be some subtle distinction
    of meaning between them that I'm not aware of.)"

  body: It's 264e, Libra. Unless it has an obscure usage in cardiology, it is probably
    being misused for 2245 (equal with a tilde over it) or 2250 (equal with a dot
    over it), which are other common "approximately equal" symbols.

  body: "Based on the meaning of the text, it should probably be \"less than or equal
    to\": \u2264\r\n\r\nIf the text was originally handwritten by a doctor, and there
    was no pharmacist available to interpret, that would explain the discrepancy."

  body: "Yes, of course, Libra! Good catch, I knew I'd seen this somewhere before
    :)\r\n\r\nNick: The symbol appears twice in the picture (scroll to the right!),
    and in the first sentence \"more than or equal to\" would make more sense. So
    it's probably just \"approximately equal to\"."
