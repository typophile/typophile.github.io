  I have come across some old broken hotel china made by Knowles, Taylor and Knowles
  (KT&K) pottery firm from 1885 - 1904 time frame. What I am looking for the is name
  of the type, a complete character map, and if it is available? I was directed here
  from the Abstractfonts.com page.\r\nthanks \r\n\r\nmike\r\n\r\n"
