  body: "This is a logo for an expansion program for a church. The underlying message
    is the power of \"one\" or unity. Bringing a bunch of people together to accomplish
    a common goal or make an impact on:\r\n\r\nIndividuals who impact\r\nFamilies
    who impact\r\nCommunities who impact\r\nCulture ... etc\r\n\r\nSub-text is: The
    power of one ... Life ... Family ... Culture ... etc\r\n\r\nThe mark is derived
    from a glass tower that stands in the courtyard of the property. The courtyard
    is kind of a central meeting place (tables, chairs, etc.) so we thought it would
    serve as a nice inspiration for the mark.\r\n\r\nI chose Dax as the typeface as
    I felt it had a calm, inviting feel to it's shapes. Not a huge fan of the \"c\"
    and I had to merge the \"I\" and a \"1\" for the first letter as well as elongate
    the \"p\" to allow for better framing.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: I think the slogan is taken already (Capital One, maybe?). I've heard it before.

  body: I'm sure it is... In fact I even heard it on TV today once. It's not that
    big of a deal though. We didn't think "The power of one" was original at all.
    It just fit the message too well so we used it.
