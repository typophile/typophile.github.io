  in the glyph window.\r\n\r\nWhen I click on one of my glyph windows so I can edit
  the character I find that I can not grab any of the points and that in my toolbar
  panel all of the tools such as Drawing, Eraser, Add Corner etc are grayed out and
  I can not use them. Does anyone have any idea on how I can edit my glyphs? Thanks
  for the help!\r\n\r\nc."
