body: "Strange FontLab bug: When I make a guideline global, and select the property
  \"visual descender\", the font window view suddenly changes, all characters become
  much bigger, filling their cells completely, like this: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot_6_4022.png]\r\nIt
  then becomes normal again after a while, but I've found no way of changing it back.
  Globally removing the guideline that caused it, has no effect. \r\n\r\nHas anyone
  else experienced this? \r\n\r\nI'm using FontLab 5.0.4 on Win7. The bug is gone
  in the 5.2 prerelease, but that is not usable yet, sadly. \r\n\r\n"

    no effect.\r\n\r\nAnd it has nothing to do with the font file, obviously, because
    now all fonts I open in FontLab looks like this. Sigh.\r\n\r\nEdit: After opening
    twenty or so fonts, everything suddenly became normal again. "

  body: What you experienced in 5.04 is actually normal behavior. Using the guideline
    you have set the Tools > Options > Glyph window > Dimensions > Visual descender
    parameter. Removing the guideline doesn't change options. If you cannot reproduce
    this in v5.2 then this is a bug in 5.2.

    guidelines have an additional set of commands located in the\r\nGuideline Is submenu.
    By selecting the commands in this submenu you\r\ncan set the font parameters:

    see. Thank you. But why did it then reset itself after opening twenty fonts? This
    is really confusing. I must have misunderstood the concept of visual ascender
    and descender. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>who congratulated me on \"finding an undocumented
    feature\" </blockquote> \r\n\r\nWhat a fantastic example of corporate Newspeak!
    I bet they maintain lists. "

      can only guess. You could reset FLS options to defaults at some point.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"
