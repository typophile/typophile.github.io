  body: "I don't think the illustration is cheesy. On the contrary - just the text
    would probably have difficulties standing out. I think you could even enlarge
    the illustration somewhat (and perhaps place the quill in the ink bottle) to give
    it increased emphasis.\r\n\r\nIs there a particular reason why you have chosen
    oblique Courier for the text? Given the style of your home page, I guess your
    intention might be to resemble typwriter text. In that case, it might be better
    to use an upright style. On the other hand, given the feather pen, a script style
    would perhaps be more suitable. Also, the text would probably be easier to read
    if the letters were not outlines.\r\n\r\nJust my two nickles.\r\n\r\n/M\xE5ns"

  body: "Seen in your post, it looks decent.  Seen in context of your website, it
    falls a little flat.  The separation between the first and second lines of text
    suit the placement of the quill but not the integrity of the interaction of the
    text.  I'd like to see the quill interact with the well, and then those two elements
    correspond with your text.  Furthermore, don't neglect to take M\xE5ns's suggestions
    into account.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Fonts should be changed. Outlines don't work in this context. They also have
    some sort of shadow that makes it blurred a bit.\r\n\r\nYour E.R. are also more
    slanted as ELSEWORTH. Looks like fake italics.\r\n\r\nAnyway. Fonts don't work.
    I also wouldn't combine text and imagery so close together. Especially when font
    style and image style don't match each other."

  body: To me the graphics don't sit well with the text. I agree with mans, a quill
    leans more toward hand lettering. Pardon my rip, but I think it needs your own
    signature or something like Deadman.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Deadman_4946.gif]
