  are the backbone of discussion, but two positively mundane HTML elements, <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, are disallowed?\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the
  poor <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element is used and abused, although it is <em>not</em>
  the most appropriate markup for quotations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the W3C, \"<code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>\"
  is markup for text which \"contains a citation or a reference to other sources.\"
  \ (<cite>[[http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-CITEM|HTML 4.01 Specification
  &sect; 9.2.1 Phrase elements]]</cite>)\r\n\r\nAllowing <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>
  is fine, even giving it a little semantic wiggle room, but not allowing <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
  or <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> is just plain silly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is
  a forum <em>for</em> discussion, shouldn't the proper markup be allowed?\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"
