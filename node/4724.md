    this -- chances are someone else has asked about it.'

  body: thank you very much <BR>with this information, what&#39;s the best bet to
    go about being able to use the font to replicate the magazine cover for a project?
    <BR>if you can answer the question.

  body: 'Have a look through <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en">DaFont</a> and see
    if you like anything there. Alternately, if all you need is to try to replicate
    this cover, then why don&#39;t you try drawing the glyphs yourself? It&#39;s pretty
    much all straight lines, so it will be not too hard to do a rough job of it, and
    you&#39;ll gain experience at the same time. Or, one last option: you could easily
    isolate the letters in Photoshop with such a scan as this.'
