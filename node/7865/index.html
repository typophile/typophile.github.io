		<div class="commentbody">Kenn, it has been built and opens today. The image is a press one, and so is primped somewhat! <BR> <BR>John, I think it was very brave of them to try this, and using Romano-Celtic lettering on such a monumental and central scale on a building who&#39;s focus is the literary tradition of Wales seems fitting and amusing - at least, to me. I&#39;m not sure I see it as aping any more than modern-day typographers &#34;ape&#34; any of those in the past. Whether it is the world&#39;s best example typographically speaking is of course debatable - for example, some of the spacing has been compromised in order to maintain structural integrity of the building. <BR> <BR>Then again, you know an awful awful lot more about type than I <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The issue I have with it is one of scale and appropriateness to the structure of the building, which is massive and, from the pictures I&#39;ve seen so far, overbearing in a very literal way. These are letterforms that belong at a smaller scale: they are intimate, not monumental. This is why I think it looks like a pastiche &#40;and very much a pastiche of David Jones&#39; quite personal lettering, rather than a new interpretation of his historical inspiration&#41;. So to me it looks like something that has been done by someone who doesn&#39;t really understand what is in his hands. And this is confirmed by their website, because on <a href="http://www.wmc.org.uk/index.cfm?method=building.inscription">this page</a> there is an image that is captioned <i>Romano Celtic Heritage</i>. This is a detail of David Jones&#39; inscription that begins &#39;Cara Wallia derelicta...&#39; &#40;a poster of which is sitting about two metres to my right as I type this&#41;, made in London c.1959. Many of the letterforms on the new building appear to have been copied directly from this inscription. The original, by the way, is in black and green, not the red seen on the website. <BR> <BR>You&#39;d think they would at least credit him -- a major Welsh artist --, rather than trying to pass of his unique work as some kind of generic ancient heritage.</div>

The letter forms give the appearance of being incised or debossed. The whole canopy/roof structure has the feeling of a massive cliff with incised lettering.The signage blends in with the background material therefore the copy can be used in monumental size with out being overbearing. <BR>Hopefully we can get better daytime close up photos of the signage so we can see the details. <BR> <BR>The night photo of the signage fails miserably and is only a rendering so I would not put to much faith in the effect it creates. Hopefully they used as much sensitivity for the night time appearance as the daytime.  <BR>The use of white copy on a dark background with that line spacing is terrible.

I&#39;ve not seen this before &#40;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been in Swansea since I was about eight years old&#41;. This is a nice piece: the density of the text is similar to Jones&#39; work, but of course the lettering style is quite different and much more regularised: Jones never claimed to be a calligrapher, and considered his inscriptions as paintings not writings. What I particularly like about the Ieuan Rees carving is the white painted lettering, the blue of the slate, and the rise and fall of the lines of text: whitecap waves in Swansea Bay.</div>
