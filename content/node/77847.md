  body: "Hi, thanks. Yeah I know about Paratype, and I was unable to find anything
    close, which is why I asked here. The closest to Copperplate Gothic on that site
    is a Cyrillic version of Engravers Gothic. That's why I asked here since I know
    there's lots of font enthusiasts, experts, designers here, etc.\r\n\r\nI was wondering/hoping
    someone was aware of a similar font to Calisto or Copperplate Gothic, perhaps
    I just don't see it. Like I know there's a Cyrillic version of Trajan called Romul."
