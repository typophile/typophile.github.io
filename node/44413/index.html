<p>Windows 2000 was great. It worked pretty well and the interface made some degree of sense. And then Microsoft got all insecure when OS X came out and Windows XP turned into some deranged knockoff with a murky interface. And don’t even get me started on licensing headaches and getting the early releases working right in my corporate LAN were like. Windows XP should have just been another service pack for Windows 2000.</p>
<p><cite>No doubt you would whimper like a lost puppy if your favorite OS were headed for extinction.</cite></p>
<p>Not really. When Windows 2000 was replaced with XP I just moved over to Mac OS, and that’s not the only OS I’ve dumped in favor of something better. Finding something else to use has never really been an issue.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a primary Mac OS X user, I have to say that I quite like Vista. I have boot camped my MacBook Pro and have Vista running on a partition. It runs like a dream. So far, I&rsquo;ve only had three problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>That security window that pops up all the time really pisses me off :)</li>
<li>One piece of (common) software that I wanted to install wasn&rsquo;t Vista-compatible</li>
<li>Printer-compatibility issues with one (new) printer</li>
</ol>
<p>As for 1, I guess that is never going away :(
But 2 and 3 would no doubt change very quickly if Vista were the default OS.
I don&rsquo;t use slow computers, so I haven&rsquo;t any hardware needs I guess.</p>
<p>Also, Vista&rsquo;s non-Latin script support is the best there is. So…</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I actually prefer XP. You can customize almost everything in it. As for interface issues, I don&rsquo;t think the dock or the lack of a right-mouse button really add to OS X&rsquo;s utility. (I haven&rsquo;t used OS X much, so I could be wrong.) I disabled the fisher-price theme, so it looks just like 2000 and runs fast. I dual-boot Linux, which is far less sophisticated than either Windows or OS X. There was a similar outcry when MS stopped support for 98. I&rsquo;ve used 2000 a lot, which is an OK system, but crashes more than XP. XP almost never crashes. Vista had some bugs, which always happens when you make so many changes. OS 10.0 Cheetah had similar issues. You can tell that MS spent a lot of money on Vista. It has a lot of cool new features like automatic diagnostics. The cost of Windows is a big plus for me, too. I haven&rsquo;t bought a single program for my computer and it was built from parts. I heavily modified my security settings so I don&rsquo;t get any viruses, even with all the crap I download from the net. I imagine that viruses will have a really hard time infecting Vista, too.</div>

Yes, you&rsquo;re wrong about the lack of a right mouse button. Though the actual multibutton &ldquo;Mighty&rdquo; mouse wasn&rsquo;t a standard shipping part with Apple computers until 2 years ago, the function was supported in the Mac OS since system 8 (more or less. You could map the contextual menu activator to the right mouse button with a third-party mouse and driver at least that far back, but now no additional drivers are needed.)</div>

<p>Although XP as such is far from being ideal, my interface is customized exactly the way I want it and I don&rsquo;t use corporate LAN so I have no complaints in this section. Mac users also have their specific issues so who knows what could make me switch to another OS.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t want to go on at great length about this, but I&rsquo;ve been using OSX 10.4 for nearly 4 months now again (after using windows 2k and XP for some years before, after using os9 and early osx versions before and in parallel), and I have to say: if you are really into it, Windows is much better than most would think that are primarly using an other system. This does not mean it is superior. An osx user adopting to windows may have as much problems as I still have adopting to the ways osx works. It&rsquo;s just different, and the ways are not very compatible, which makes it difficult to understand the &ldquo;other side&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Besides that, xp with 2k-interface is the best windows version I had until now. It&rsquo;s just very stable, the handling is streamlined, it&rsquo;s fast on todays computers, and everything runs on it. I&rsquo;ve tried vista with a new notebook I purchased but replaced it for XP a week later.</p>
<p>What I do not understand is why we should &ldquo;save&rdquo; XP: there are so many XP licences to purchase out there, why should I buy a new one from MS?</p>
