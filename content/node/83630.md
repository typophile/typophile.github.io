body: "We are having an issue with a font that I or IT cannot figure out. I should
  note that the images I am posting aren't the font in question but they show another
  font we never use that is doing the same thing. The font in question is ITC Bodoni
  72 BookItalic. Any help is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThe first image (screwy
  font.jpg) shows how it looks on the screen. The top paragraph is how it types in
  and looks on the screen. As you can see, it appears ragged but is styled justified.
  Also, it creates these awkward breaks in words such as the fourth to fifth line.
  You can see, at far right, a hyphen inserted for the break. This image doesn't show
  it, but it often inserts large, random gaps and breaks throughout the text. I put
  the second graph (highlighted) on here to show how the font appears to be filling
  space to the end of each line, but in reality doesn't. And the third graph is the
  actual text in another font that works. One note: when working with the font, the
  cursor does not land at the spot you are working. So, it appears to be about 10
  characters ahead of the actual site of work, which obviously makes it difficult
  to edit and work with. \r\n\r\nThe second image shows how the first image prints.
  \r\n\r\nWe have established a workaround: A restart in safe mode (we think) rebuilds
  the font cache and upon normal restart the font works fine. Long-term this doesn't
  feel like a solution, but I am curious if others face this issue. \r\n\r\nThanks
  again! "

    That may very well be the answer to it all. Lol.
