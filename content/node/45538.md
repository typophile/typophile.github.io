  trying to find exact fonts for both main type, Jade Palace and sub type, Golf Club.\r\nThe
  main type seems to be EF Ballantines Script Light, but I don't see it exactly overlaping.
  And as far as the sub type goes, I have no idea what exactly the font is used. Can
  anyone please identify them?\r\nYour help would be highly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jpgc_3519.jpg]"

    Script]], (a.k.a. Goddess) although maybe a heavier weight than light.  \"Golf
    Club\" looks like an Italic of one of the Bodonis. I'll try to see if I can narrow
    it down.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Italic is pretty close (at least it has the C with no lower serif), but it looks
    like the letters were slanted more to match the script slant, and their tracking
    was tightened to cram the letters closer together.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
