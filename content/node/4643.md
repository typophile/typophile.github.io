  body: 'I&#39;ll begin by saying that I&#39;ve hotwired many fonts before. In fact
    I&#39;ve stolen Myriad before. Then I designed my first typeface and I realized
    that it takes many many months to draw all those letters. Perhaps <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&amp;profile=tphinney-users"
    target="_blank">Thomas</a> can enlighten us, but I imagine it took <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/twomblybio/main.html"
    target="_blank">Carol</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/slimbach.html"
    target="_blank">Robert</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/slye.html"
    target="_blank">Christopher</a>, Fred and the rest of the Adobe Type staff many
    moons of labor to create Myriad Pro given the thousands of letters and languages
    included in the font. <BR> <BR>But to answer your question, I don&#39;t know if
    Adobe sells a true type version anymore. They sell individual weights of the font
    for a mere 35 dollars. Perhaps the best way to find out is to do this: <BR> <BR>Hey
    Thomas, is it possible to purchase a true type version of Myriad? <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR>Randy'

    &#34;Web Pro&#34; fonts are &#34;in TrueType flavored OpenType format, optimized

  body: All told, I&#39;d estimate at least a couple of person-years of work went
    into Myriad Pro. Most of that is due to the combination of the extended language
    support and the perfectionism of the designers &#40;including Christopher and
    Fred, not just Carol and Robert&#41;. Christopher did the Greek extensions, and
    Fred the Cyrillic, both with Robert&#39;s guidance. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: You guys are right about bootleg fonts. That said, Myriad Pro is available
    for FREE from Adobe, if you buy their software. It&#39;s bundled with Illustrator
    CS, as are many other OpenType fonts like Minion Pro, and if you buy the whole
    CS suite you can download the complete Brioso Pro Opticals set of 42 fonts. At
    $35 per font, that&#39;s $1470 worth right there, more than the cost of the suite!

  body: I&#39;d be careful about using the word &#34;free,&#34; but it certainly is
    bundled with a number of Adobe applications. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: I agree with Thomas. These fonts certainly aren&#39;t free, and using that
    word may cause confusion. I&#39;d rather say they&#39;re included in the price
    of the applications from the Crative Suite set.  <BR> <BR>Adam <BR>
