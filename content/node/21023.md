  "Good Teeth," "Vitality," etc. type on this one?

    nice as well if anyone know one.

      but your mention of Font Diner jogged my memory. They have a face called Milwaukee
      that's a good fit.

    do you think it's because it was easier for lettering artists and sign painters
    to produce squared gothics with more consistency than circular ones? Also, scripts
    always seem to be part of the repertoire."

    Milwaukee is nice -albeit more rounded than the sample - hate the S tho - and
    you can't beat FontDiner's prices.\r\n\r\nI remember that recent thread about
    the Daniel Clowes lettering for Art School Confidential.\r\n"

    fairly similar, very free, and almost pefectly matches the \"Cleveland Division
