  body: "Agree Frutiger Black's _C_ and _p_ would be a good basis for modification
    to make the logo. Also the top stroke on _a_.\r\nBut the lower bowl on _a_, with
    its compound curve to meet the vertical, is closer to Folio Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/folio/
    which also has a closer shape for the foot on the vertical stroke of _a_.\r\nDon"
