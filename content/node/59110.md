  body: "There was a thread on this...\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't think there
    is any need, and it really compromises the appearance of glyphs, especially the
    Euro symbol.\r\nThe reason is that figure positioning in columns is now done by
    tabbing, rather than filling space with quads.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I do try
    and make the Dollar and Sterling tab figure width.\r\n\r\nActually, it's a good
    idea if you're thinking about tab figure width, to consider designing all figures
    in a family to the same width from the outset -- lining and oldstyle, different
    weights, roman and italic."

    one [[http://typophile.com/node/41191|here]] (asked in an eerily similar way!).
