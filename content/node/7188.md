  body: You won&#39;t be able to find an exact match. those letters are redrawn from
    another typeface with just enough manipulation to make it impossible to match.
    welcome to camp ownability. :^D  <BR>a close match is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/windsor-mt/windsor-mt/testdrive.html?s=sundance&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> windsor</a> this monotype versions seems to have the wonkiest
    serifs, but it still isn&#39;t what i would call a perfect match. korinna and
    souvenir also have some similarities, but windsor is the closest. please, someone
    prove me wrong.

  body: here i&#39;ll prove myself wrong. closer than windsor is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cantoria/mt-bold/testdrive.html?s=sundance&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> cantoria</a> i forget about this one. sorry. the serifs still
    need to be bludgeoned and then softened. but much closer.

  body: At first glance, I thought it was pretty close to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/goudy-mt/bold/testdrive.html?s=sundance&amp;p=72">Goudy</a>.
    But the terminal and the axis on the lc &#34;a&#34; are different. <BR>Although
    weight-wise it is close than Cantoria? <BR>

  body: Tiffany --   <BR>  <BR>Cantoria is close, but I think the Sundance Channel
    logo was derived from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/della-robbia/bold/testdrive.html?s=sundance&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Della Robbia</a> &#40;drawn originally for ATF by T.M. Cleland&#41;.  <BR>  <BR>You&#39;ll
    see that the structure of the &#39;a&#39; is much closer. There has still been
    some modification -- the spine and upper curve of the &#39;s&#39;, for instance
    -- but I&#39;m pretty sure that Della Robbia was the basis for this logo.  <BR>  <BR>--

  body: Good call Kent. That <i>a</i> is much closer. I do however really like what
    they did change in the serifs, how soft and <i>&#34;stickley&#34;</i> they feel.
