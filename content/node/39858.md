  body: "Hate to make this one a cold case, but I walked past Koenig today and it
    is not Akkurat. When you actually see it close the typeface has far more stroke
    contrast than the famously linear Akkurat. Call me mad, it does LOOK like Akkurat
    in that photo.\r\n\r\nThey have either changed it from the above or I am going
    insane."
