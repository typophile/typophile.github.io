  of articles I read. Just the other day I read a tutorial describing a way to make
  vector tribal art with Adobe Illustrator. Wouldn't you know it? I can not for the
  life of me find the article. I've looked in all of my Adobe Illustrator mags, Photoshop
  User, Layers, Before and After UGH!\r\n\r\nWould anyone be able to point me in the
  right direction? Your assistance is VERY much appreciated."

    about \r\nstarting from scratch or tracing existing images ?\r\n\r\ni'd draw it
    by hand first, at least the primary curves. scan, place in illustrator, vector
    trace. \r\nthe illustrator point/blunt distortion filter might come in handy.\r\ncopy,
    paste, reduce, enlarge, for rhythmic repetitions.\r\n\r\ntribal art is a vague
    term for several styles so it depends..."

    you see in all the television commericals right now. It isn't tribal by definition,
    but that's the closest term I could come up with.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply."

  body: "I haven't seen a tutorial, but it doesn't seem that complicated. I would
    scan the art, take it into Illustrator, run the auto trace tool, then clean up
    the vector lines. If you just want to get some ready made, here's a link if you
    haven't seen it already... not bad for fifteen US dollars:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gomedia.us/v3/vectorpacks\">http://www.gomedia.us/v3/vectorpacks</a>"

  body: "Ch - This may sound kind of lame, would you suggest YouTube for the frame
    grab?\r\n\r\nAluminum - Thank you very much for the link. The article was very
    much along the same line as the link you provided.\r\n\r\nBlueStreak - we have
    been debating which pack(s) to buy from that very site. Those are excellent packs
    for the price. Thank you very much."

      or do you have time to develop something ?\r\n\r\nno wrong answers - all familiar

  body: "Ch,\r\n\r\nI believe you've hit the nail on the head with a much more accurate
    and better description of the look I am trying to imitate. If you watch anything
    on Discovery/Comedy Central/you-name-it-channel, you'll see examples. The client?
    Product Managers. They've come to us to apply that same look and feel to a line
    of backpacks/messenger bags. They described one of the looks should resemble 'tribal
    art'. I immediately thought of the 'symmetrical baroque grunge' look that you
    mentioned. It just so happened, I had received a magazine of some sort that had
    a step by step tutorial on how to achieve that very look. However, with all the
    magazines I get, I can not for the life of me locate or replicate that tutorial.\r\n\r\nI
    gave them something as the turnaround of the project was a couple of days. My
    personality will not allow me to settle for what was given, so I decided to investigate
    more in-depth on my own."
