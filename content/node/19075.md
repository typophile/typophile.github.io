body: "Hi, I'm looking for a simple dotted font that could work for skywriting. I've
  tried in Photoshop to make dots over a template but I'm wearing out. I've googled
  and searched this site. I'm attaching one attempt at using a stripey font (Labtop
  Tartan--not one of your more elegant fonts...) but I'm not impressed.\r\n\r\nThanks--I'm
  new to this site but I've loved fonts for 30 years--I knew typography was a profession
  but I didn't know it was such an official obsession. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bluesky.jpg]"

  body: I'm afraid you're not going to find a font that will be convincing on its
    own. Applying the effect to soft font like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=PRC.123369.0.0">Bryant</a>
    is the best way to go.

  body: Reminds me of an old typeface from Casady & Greene called Giotto. But, now
    that I've found it, the A and K are completely different. Looks to me like they
    used step & repeat on a blue line to create this effect.

    it's a fully-connected OpenType script that has a range of monoline weights. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    take the Thin, convert to outline and texture-paint the path in Illustrator with
    dots, then import into PS and blur.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I recommend you to experiment with different "cloudy" photoshop-brushes and
    draw the text by hand. Some irregularity is a good thing here.

  body: You haven't a clue about sky writing its not a continious line like the old
    biplanes. What they do is make a series of dashes that form letters as they fly.
    An example would be an I being created from four verticle dashes with space in
    between each. A N would be the same four verticle dashes but with one dash after
    it at the number 2 level and another at the number 3 level then 4 more dashes.
    I will see If I can find an example I made a number of years ago in Photoshop.

    mask the layer with a font you like.\r\nThen gaussian blur the mask to soften
    it a little and use soft brushes in the mask to make some irregularities\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"
