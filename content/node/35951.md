body: "Hi all- this is all new to me so please forgive my ignorance up front.\r\n\r\nI've
  been tasked with laying out a 100-page textbook-like publication (research based)
  on student achievement... I don't have much of a design background at all.\r\n\r\nI
  chose Perpetua Titling for my headers, Garamond for my text body- and used some
  different versions of Garamond for my pull out boxes- back to perpetua for pullout
  quotes.\r\n\r\nMy boss likes it for the most part- but she is a big fan of Arial,
  as all of our materials that preceded this particular project (handouts, powerpoints,
  workbooks, etc.) have used Arial. For everything. It's always been one of my least
  favorites, and really looks amateur in a textbook format.\r\n\r\nI'm using the newest
  Indesign, but I don't have time to keep playing with the type as much as I would
  like, so I found you all. I'm hoping you have some suggestions that could make her
  happy (but for real, how much of a \"brand\" can you build on an Arial font?)\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance! I can't wait for your thoughts! Jen"

    like comparing Arial with fonts that are actually drawn well to make one realize
    how ugly it really is\u2014the devil is in the details."

  body: Thanks, all- If we went with something comparable to the Helvetica- what's
    a good secondary type for the pullouts?

    a serif font. (Colin Wheildon's research)

  body: "Commissioners are sometimes quite fussy and always ignorant about fonts.
    So don\u2019t try to persuade them. Especially if they are 45+ women. No sexist
    intentions there, just mere experience. If a commissioner has the time to quarrel
    over fonts and to infringe on your design, likely he or she is someone fitting
    the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle\">Peter principle</a>.
    Be pragmatic, ignore the pedantry, do as you please and get the approval of someone
    higher in rank, someone with no explicit opinions about fonts, but who'll sure
    acknowledge the designer knows for the best. He/she will really <em>see</em> the
    difference, especially if you say him/her Arial is a discount wholesale product,
    lacking each and every distinction."

    one version of it for the body text, headers, pull quotes, etc. With italics and
    size variations you can achieve contrast. If you want a contasting face for certain
    elements, use a good sans. '
