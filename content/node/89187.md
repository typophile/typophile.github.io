  in FontLab 5.1.1. before I generate a font that will be used for a Penta typesettingsystem?
  At least I hope solving the problem is in the FontInfo. Several attempts are done
  already and we are running out of time. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nNicolien"

    environment. Examine the font info and apply it back to your font.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps!"

  body: "That is something I did, it does not work. Can it be that the character naming
    for the Penta/Unix has a restricting? Use of periods in naming, or more than ten
    positions (e.g. acircumflex has 10 positions)?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "What kind of fonts are you actually making? OpenType fonts or old-school
    Unix PostScript Type 1 (.pfa) fonts or something else?\r\n\r\nFor OpenType fonts
    it should not matter when you use periods in glyphnames (as long as your OpenType
    features reference them). But PostScript Type 1 fonts don't support OpenType features
    *and* need to comply with certain encodings. Some time ago I had to generate Unix
    pfa fonts in Adobe Standard Encoding for use in Framemaker for instance."

  body: The fonts are old-school Unix Postscript Type 1. The customer told me they
    need an .pfb font, so I generate in FontLab the FontFormat 'Win Type1' and also
    an suitcase with .afm included. Maybe the Adobe Standard Encoding can be a clue.
    Thanks for this!

  body: "Paul, thanks for all the help. It seems the reason why the font did not work
    on the Penta system was not in the font itself that I had generate but in the
    Penta-system. The font is being tested now. \r\n\r\n"
