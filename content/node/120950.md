  body: "The image quality is very poor, but the style of the typeface could look
    \"copperplate-gothic-ish\", but the fish tail |&| doesn't seem common in this
    style.*\r\nSome that could remind it:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmaker/fm-bolyar-pro/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/sistina/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nonpareille/petit-serif/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-serif-gothic/\r\n\r\n*
    There is a slim chance that some of the more recent takes could have an alternate,
    fish tail |&|, but I haven't checked."
