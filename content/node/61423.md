  a hair salon. (pro bono)\r\nAs many of you are aware, an ambigram is something that
  reads the same upside down.\r\nI thought it was a nice play on the name of the salon.\r\n\r\nI've
  been staring at it a bit too long and would like to put it up on the table for just
  criticism.\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twist_ambigram_3899.jpg]"

    it's twisted gets me started. Though there two things I'm not quite sure about.\r\n\r\n(1)
    Maybe try to get the highlightet areas a bit bolder. Not the same boldness like
    in the other parts but maype a bit more solid to get an improvement of the overall
    gestalt when displayed at smaller sizes.\r\n\r\n(2)Now the very beginning and
    the very end of the word start with some kind of dot sharing the same size like
    the dot of the i. I think if you'd size it up a bit the word would be easier to
    grasp at first sight.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twist_ambigram_3899_4245.jpg]"

    thickened the down strokes slightly and made the dot on the \"i\" larger, as well
    as the starting point of the \"t\".\r\nI've also slightly changed the bend in
    the backbone of the \"s\" which is also the middle stroke of the \"w\".\r\n\r\nThe
    sketch titled \"A\" was the starting point, \"B\" is reflecting the changes described
    above.\r\nThe bottom sketch shows one idea of incorporating the type of business-hair
    salon.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your insight. What do you think?\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/twist_ambigram_02_6350.jpg]"

  body: "Can't stop smiling :)\r\n\r\nIt looks so much better than version A. I think
    you've made some really clever decisions here. Especially the changes on the backbone
    of the s makes it twisting even better than before. I also like the size of the
    dots. They absolutely fit in now.\r\n\r\nDue to your changes there is one thing
    that came to my mind. It's now much easier to grasp the word and it's really engaging
    to look at it but what if the part where 'i' and 's' meet at the 'baseline' were
    more balanced. I mean pushed upwards a little bit to reduce confusion (or call
    it graphical smog) and making it even easier for the eye to capture.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if this is understandable but I hope the screenshot shows you what I
    mean.\r\n\r\nHuge improvement so far, maybe my advice arised by reason of my personal
    taste but I would really like to see you trying something like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    combination with 'HAIR SALON' doesn't work for me. It's twisted text twisting
    around twisted text twisting in to different ways. Maybe if executed better it
    might work but generally i'm thinking of a little more solid 'HAIR SALON'. I'm
    looking forward to seeing more iterations on this task.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twist_ambigram_02_6350_6603.jpg]"

    in the center, the twisting aspect is not quite resolved on the previous sketches.\r\nthe
    ambigram adds to the complexity, as it must read the same upside down, so in trying
    to keep with that I've taken less of the twist from the center\r\nand pushed and
    pulled the ascenders and descenders to align more. \r\n\r\ni can see the loop
    in the w being mistaken for an e, lending itself to read as jewish.\r\nthe funny
    thing is you only need to see part of a letter to read it, so I'm struggling with

  body: "I would like to see the middle stroke of the 'w' to be pushed a little to
    the left so it would be in the optical center of the letter. Maybe also make it
    a little higher. I think that this would not destroy the connection of 'i' and
    's'. This is very subtle and maybe also a little guesswork.\r\n\r\nThe comment
    is regarding to (M) in which I would start/end the word with the dots featured
    in (F). I can't tell you the reason why but the dots do not only look better they
    are also supporting the overall message. They make me think of a Hair Studio.
    The later iterations do more remind me of hair in general but don't seem to work
    for the studio in my eyes. Maybe it's a bit too experimental to work as a brand.
    Somehow it reminds me of http://img.snowrecords.com/cd/1/5275.jpg which is absolutely
    gorgeous but would not be suitable for a professional studio.\r\n\r\nAfter reading
    my comment again I want to say that you've done a great job so far. Especially
    the whole process is very positive and your recent versions are really looking
    extra good. Take my advice as the result of my personal taste. I am not talking
    about having it wrong and making it right. It's just my feelings about it.\r\n"

  body: what if the tapered ends twisted the other way? you'd still have a "t", and
    without the upward swoosh you'd avoid the appearance of "j". That is, if you value
    the tapered ends. It might be just me, but the tapered ends say "hair studio"
    much more loudly than the dotted versions (which are more suggestive of "liquid,"
    and therefore could easily be a logo for a bar or bistro).

  body: '"Jewish"? Thanks makes more sense than my first mis-impression, which was
    something like "fetish." My point is that the loops in the W''s strongly suggest
    E''s, and I think they should be closed. Agree strongly that ''hair salon'' should
    be in any plain type--not twisted or tricked up, as that would distract from the
    main design. I''d like to see a version with ''hair salon'' closer to the TWIST--so
    that the descending stroke of the last T stabs down between ''hair'' and ''salon''.'
