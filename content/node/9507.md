body: Right...  <BR> <BR>I just bought Eclat from the net in college and got it to
  work on the computers there using illustrator CS and font book. But when I try it
  on my mac at home using illustrator 10 and Suitcase the kerning is wayy to wide.
  Anyone know what the problem is?

  body: You might be using optical spacing in Illustrator CS. Where&#39;d you license
    the type from? Seems to me that if I had a problem with a typeface I&#39;d call
    the people from whom I licensed the type.

  body: Technical problem with Eclat font. Small suspicion that it is a knock-off
    of some kind.  <BR> <BR>This is a thread started in the GENERAL area which I thought
    might get a few more useful eyeballs on it if it were here in the BUILD area.
