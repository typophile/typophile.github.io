  body: "Questions:\r\n1) Does there not need to be a Russian angle to the name?\r\n2)
    \"... if their submission contains the name we decide to use as our new business
    name.\" By \"contains\", is it possible you could for example add \"The\" to the
    submitted name and not pay up?\r\n3) If a submitter is told that he has to share
    the prize because others also thought of the same name, how does he know that's
    true?\r\n4) \"If you have not received an email after 30 days from your submission
    ...\" There are more than 30 days between now and March 1 (January30 + 30 days).
    Does that mean you will not necessarily wait until the deadline to pick a winner?
    Also: why would it be difficult to alert the winner?\r\n5) Is there an easy way
    to check for USPTO availability?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    not good enough. You'll have to be as specific as possible, in writing.\r\n\r\n>
    What do you recommend?\r\n\r\nA combination of two things:\r\n1) Accept only submissions
    made in public (on third-party blogs/fora, with a time stamp).\r\n2) Accept the
    first instance of a submitted name.\r\n\r\n> But in case there were problems with
    contacting ...\r\n\r\nFair enough.\r\nBut we do need to know exactly who to expect

      \ Rough & Silky sounds a bit too naughty :-P  I like Golden Steppes.  Not sure
      if I get the import part of it.. but it does have a sort of rustic grassland
      ring too it.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that you respond to the email provided
