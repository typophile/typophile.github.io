  have FF DIN (Mac Postscript) and just bought FF DIN Italic Regular and Italic Light.
  They both show up in Suitcase, but Italic Regular is missing from all CS2 apps.
  Italic Light is fine though. Italic Regular shows up in Quark 6 and even bloody
  Word; just not in Adobe apps.\r\n\r\nAny ideas or tricky tricks?\r\n\r\nCheers."

    sure you have the Suitcase plug-ins installed for all of your Adobe CS applications.
    The plug-in ensures that fonts used in certain documents will load when the document
    is opened. Just check the Plug-ins folders for each app.\r\n\r\nSecond, (this
    works in Suitcase X1, at least) you can create an Application-specific font set
    within Suitcase which will open each font added to it when that application is
    launched. \r\n\r\n1) Go to File > New Application Set...\r\n2) Drag and drop fonts
    to the application set.\r\n3) For this to work, Suitcase needs to be launched
    prior to launching the applications.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/appSet_4787.jpg]"

    you checked the font with Tools-Verify Font? (off the top of my head- could be
    slightly different)\r\n\r\nThe next thing to check would be some kind of duplicate.\r\n\r\nGood
    Luck!\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "If the font previews correctly in Suitcase, there is a high probability that
    it is functional. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you don't mention your specific OS. If,
    in fact, you have Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger), you might want to try clearing your Mac
    OS font caches. This would be performed by deleting the following folder /Library/Caches/com.apple.ATS/.
    Immediately reboot. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, fonts may not appear the same way in
    the menus of different applications. That doesn't seem likely to me in this case
    though. This sort of issue can be verified by installing the font in the system.
    I would recommend testing it by placing it in /Users/yourusername/Library/Fonts/.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're still having trouble, let us know the various versions of Mac/Win
    and Suitcase."

  body: "Oh my gosh, I am an idiot. I just realised that 'Regular Italic' is simply
    listed as 'Italic'. I guess I was looking for 'Regular Italic' because that's
    how it's listed in Suitcase and with the font files. But no, it's just 'Italic'.\r\n\r\nNot
    quite as bad as not activating the fonts, but still pretty bad! :-) Thanks a lot
    for your replies."
