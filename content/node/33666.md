  wondering what this typeface used for the DESIGN MUSEUM's identity is. I thought
  it could be some form of Din (because of the straight leg of the R) but the S is
  nothing like any Din, it has much more of an extreme curve. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions\r\n\r\nsorry
  my terminology is terrible\r\n\r\nany suggestions for typefaces of this sort would
  be a big help too. I'm currently working on typographically illustrating Nineteen
  Eighty-Four by George Orwell for my project at uni. Im looking for a very clinical
  looking font that has impact and authority on a page that can also represent the
  uniformity of life. I'm thinking maybe something mono-linear.\r\n\r\nI would love
  to be able to afford Akkurat, but i am only a student. \r\n\r\n"

    that the Design Museum uses DM Schulbuch, a custom version of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_schulbuch/">FF
    Schulbuch</a>, which is why there are a couple of differences as Jan pointed out.
