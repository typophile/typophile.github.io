body: I'm doing a project on Willem Sandberg and was wondering if anyone knew the
  specific typeface used in this piece.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sandberg_5772.jpg]

  body: "I don't think this is a typeface per se. Where did you find this sample and
    what size has it?\r\n\r\nIt looks as if a few elements were put together in different
    instances, somewhat like Gerard Ungers Decoder can be used to build 'forms'. If
    this has been done like yhat it most likely was done in 'lead'."

  body: When I first looked at it I saw blue abstract glyphs - then it clicked - but
    that is what is so cool about positive - negative interchange - you get tricked
    by context, color. texture etc. And Hrant is right - if only we could master notan
    to the level that this was not so hit and miss.

  body: "I read this interview with <a href=\"http://www.byrnerobotics.com/\">John
    Byrne</a>, the legendary comic book artist, where he admitted that as a beginning
    artist he drew the <a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2006/superman_returns.html\">logo
    on Superman's chest</a> like two little fish-like shapes -- until he realised
    it actually was a red 'S' on a yellow shield.\r\n\r\nAnd this very morning my
    daughter discovered that the <a href=\"http://www.hypercarrefour.be/\">logo</a>
    on her cereal box is a 'c' reversed out of a diamond shape. :^)"

  body: BTW <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=egizio&x=0&y=0&sample_text=LIFE&sample_size=96">Egizio</a>
    is the only slab that has the rounded inside corners where the stems join the
    arms. In the [[David Berlow's]] <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=belizio&x=0&y=0&sample_text=LIFE&sample_size=96">version</a>
    the corners are less rounded.
