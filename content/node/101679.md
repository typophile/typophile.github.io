  two images Im posting. \r\n\r\nI have tried several options but some of them have
  elaborated cursives that make phrases hard to read. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help!"

  body: "Thank you guys!   'Me conviene' is in fact done with Tiza... I like the flow
    it has.. unfortunately once downloaded I realized it has kind of a chalk effect.
    So I'm still looking for a cleaner option more like the American Standard logo.
    \ \r\nBy the way Caflish is really nice and close to that, if I don't find the
    exact match I'll be using that. \r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    their preview didn't show the chalk effect (at least I'm not seeing it).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: The effect can be seen easily in the pdf sample and, if you click on a glyph
    image on the 'glyphs' page. Does 'caveat emptor' apply here, or shouldn't the
    initial samples be much clearer?   - Herb
