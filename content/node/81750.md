  consulting business with the main topics: callcenter & help & servicedesk.\r\nI
  also want to reflect my personality in it.\r\nI\u2019m a positive thinking person
  who likes to help people.\r\nMy satisfaction comes from resolving problems of other
  people and that\u2019s why help & servicedesk is my passion.\r\nI try to enhance
  the atmosphere at the workplace with my humor. This is very important to me. I also
  like to motivate people any way possible.\r\n\r\nThis should all reflect in a font
  that i want to use through my site & stationary.\r\nCan someone help me?\r\n\r\nthx
  for your advice.\r\n\r\nPhilippe\r\n"
