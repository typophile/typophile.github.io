    found in University Roman.\r\n\r\nThe serifs on the symbol seem to be strongly
    angled, as if an italic character were rotated by 45 degrees; I recall once seeing
    an archaic mathematical character that resembles it, but I would agree in hesitating
    to conclude it came from that part of the typecase."

    very unsure that it was intended to be anything but. However, it still might have
    been something that served another purpose, such as an Armenian lower-case letter,
    before being used as a decoration, so asking what character that shape might have
    been is legitimate even when the immediate intention was purely decorative.\r\n\r\nThat
    it could have been an old mathematical symbol, intentionally used to convey some
    authority to the contents of the book (about the evil crackpot theory known as
    <em>dialectical materialism</em>, which gave rise to such things as Lysenkoism)
    is not entirely impossible."

    the right hand; even a leftie would be hard pressed to do this without stress.
    The ductus, direction of stroke, would be counter to line writing, as in writing
    text, so I would venture this is drawn, and is very much, and developed (in this
    variation) as a \"typographic form\" as opposed to a calligraphic one.\r\n\r\nWith
    Conze's propensity for languages there is no telling where this \"form\" came
    from but I am sure I am about to find out and be made fun of :-) It literally
    looks to me as though it is a flopped l/c L because of the terminals. It was not
    uncommon for designers to combine calligraphic elements (the top of the stem)
    with more \"typographic forms \" (the bottom of the stem). \r\n\r\n@Ryan... if
    \"that big thing\" is intended solely for decoration it falls way short, which
    would lead me to believe it serves more than a decorative purpose. It is integral,
    to my thinking, in the statement.\r\n"

    a LETTERLIKE SYMBOL from the past, only encoded for backward compatibility. [The

    erratic character would then go back to the very beginning of continental printing
    in symbolic logic: \"unique element fulfilling a description\" [logic]. I am no
    logician to evaluate, but I could live with it. But as there are NO logical symbols
    \"in\" the text of the book - who knows for sure? Were there printer sets with

    And the bookbinder\u2019s lettercase is something different as the printer\u2019s.
    No bookbinding workshop maintained lettercases with most special mathematical
    characters of extremely rare use.\r\nIf there is no hint at all inside the treatise
