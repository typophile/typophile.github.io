  collection.  But it does give me grief when I try to find *just* the right font
  for a given application.\r\n\r\nSo I got Suitcase for Windows.  The thing is, I
  have a lot of fonts and I was hoping that the manager would be able to sort files
  by category...but it can't.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a way to either sort the
  files on the disk into categories, or know of a manager that can do this?\r\n\r\n...Mike"

  body: "Most font managers are capable of collecting fonts any way you want, but
    unless it either refers to an included database or embedded information in the
    fonts themselves, you will have to make these categorizations manually, to your
    own specifications. This, depending on the number of fonts in your library, can
    be very labor intensive, but in the end more useful to you than any factory-supplied
    organization system.\r\n\r\nStill it would be handy to have a guide to go by.
    The Typowiki might be a good place to start looking for one."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions everyone.\r\n\r\nI agree that categories are somewhat
    arbitrary, but I'm cool with that...50 arbitrary categories are much easier to
    deal with than 6000 individual fonts :)\r\n\r\nI tried fontorg and while it is
    a cool little app, it doesn't do anything more than what I can do with FontDoctor,
    which I already have.  If you don't have font doctor though, I recommend it.\r\n\r\nI
    tried the typowiki last night before I posted, hoping that someone had already
    asked this question and found a solution...but alas, nothing.\r\n\r\nI don't look
    forward to the hours and hours it is going to take me to sort all my fonts.\r\n\r\nEven
    the ability to preview fonts in Explorer would be welcome, because i could bin
    them that way...the unfortunate thing about suitcase is that once the fonts are
    sorted into groups within that program, the list of fonts within each group cannot
    then be exported.  If they could be, i could just write a little perl script to
    do the sorting into folders thing for me.\r\n\r\nMy search continues.  Any Mac
    or Windows suggestions are welcome, as i have and use both.\r\n\r\n...Mike"
