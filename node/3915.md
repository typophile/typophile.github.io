  body: ' What does under/over-design mean? I guess to me it means that it looks &#40;although
    not necessarily &#42;is&#42;&#41; designed too sloppily/obsessively. For example,
    a lot of people think Barcelona is over-designed &#40;although I personally think
    it&#39;s the best city in the world&#41;. BTW, I&#39;m not sure what &#34;grill&#34;
    you&#39;re talking about, but hopefully -for you- it&#39;s not the one on my car,
    &#39;cause you&#39;d have to catch me first, and if by some freak of nature you
    did, you&#39;d regret it... Hundreds of Americans agree.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>As
    for your design, the orginal is definitely the best, and although I only really
    like 18.008 of all the ones we could pick from &#40;I triple-voted for it&#41;,
    24.002 is the only other one I would actually buy, if only to support Typophile.
    Tanya&#39;s is cool, but it&#39;s just too far from my &#91;warped&#93; sense
    of style. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    a three year-long &#34;how do you know when something is actually done&#34; argument.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve always thought of &#34;under-designed&#34; as being something that
    has that look of incompletion. Overdesigned is easier; you could subtract and
    be better off than when you started. Or... it looks as though every single trick
    has been used in its creation just for the sake of something, showing off, something? '

    <BR>it should definitely be either the original or the combined graphic on the
    back. I really can&#39;t figure why the choices were boiled down to what they
    were. whatever, yours is among my favorites anyway, Graham, nice piece of work!

  body: ' wow here&#39;s a thread I missed. kind&#39;a awkward. I guess mine is the
    &#34;over-designed&#34; one we&#39;re referring to eh?  <BR> <BR>I chose, tweaked
    and arranged the faces, but what &#34;overly-designed&#34; aspects you may find
    all lay in the faces themselves - I wouldn&#39;t think its in the design. the
    arrangement is justified center and that&#39;s about it. Elements aren&#39;t thrown
    about at all. - I thought it would &#42;read&#42; very clearly to typophiles.
    I was thinking about the harley-davidson emblem/patch thing. let&#39;s ride, band
    together in our bad-&#149;&#149;&#149;, coded, shirts. the way t-shirt design
    started...for a team, a uniform, worn to identify/show-off what you like, and
    what community/club you belong to. I specifically did not want it to be simple.
    I definately don&#39;t hold any bauhaus memberships but I understand having a
    purpose for each element or arrangement of.  <BR> <BR>I do like the California
    job case too. Funny - the case itself with all its mysterious arrangement of boxes,
    we knew was designed so with some purpose and yet left such confusion. My Grandmother
    still has one filled with knick knacks above the sink. - I always wondered why
    why why those shapes and sizes. '
