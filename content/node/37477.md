  body: "\"papyrus\" is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/presence_typo/fusion_engraved/?sample_text=papyrus&sample_size=36\"
    target=\"_blank\">Fusion Engraved.</a>\r\n\r\n\"ESSENTIAL LUXURIES\" has the proportions
    of a Garamond, but which cut is hard to tell because of the printing process.
    I'd guess probably Adobe Garamond because of the 'R'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
