body: Which font, Auto by Underware, or Vista by Emigre, would reign as a superior
  sans serif for a magazine? Please list pros and cons and who wins. I'll be buying
  the champion tomorrow for our alumni magazine redesign. Thanks!

  body: "Auto 1! Auto 2! Auto 3!\r\n\r\nAs Dan said, Auto has three wonderful italics
    \u2013 nuff said. :)\r\n\r\nAmpersands. This alone should help you with your decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    family can provide you with a lot of flexibility within your design. It contains
    a nice variety of weights and styles allowing for strong typographic contrast,
    as well as an extended European character set, if required.\r\n\r\n\r\nI support
    Auto, vote today. Did I mention how H O T the third italic is? "

  body: it all depends on what "look" you're going for. if you want something with
    personality, i'd definately choose Auto. If you want something a bit more subtle,
    choose Vista. Personaly, i always love to see interesting type in magazines, and
    i think Auto is absolutely gorgeous. if it were my choice, i'd choose Auto.

  body: "I haven't used Vista but I might disagree with Paul on the point about personality...
    Vista alternates provide plenty in the personality department. I have used and
    worked with Auto and I love it. The roman is very capable and the italics are
    stunning. There's a lot of versatility built in to the different italics.\r\n"

  body: of course every face has its own personality, i just meant to say Vista has
    a more subdued personality, not quite as lively as Auto's. But not having actually
    used either, i will defer to your expertise.

    body: "While Auto's italics are stunning, I would probably only use them sparingly
      in the magazine. Sort of a secret weapon to throw out there occasionally. As
      long as Auto will function as a workhorse typeface for sidebar copy, captions,
      blurbs, etc., it seems like it could be the right choice. It's fresh, exciting,
      critically acclaimed (will be recognized in TDC's next annual). Any further
      comments/experiences/advice? Thanks.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blakedinsdale.com\">bDIN.com</a>"
