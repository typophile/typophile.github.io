body: 'I&#39;ve begun work on Frimbo Sans, a companion face to my first serif font,
  <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56784.html?1104524163">Frimbo</a>.
  The goal is to retain some of the quirkiness of the original in the overall character
  while creating as even a color as possible. Glyphs like the lc &#34;g&#34; carry
  over nicely as does most of the punctuation. Other than that, I want this face to
  look more &#34;finished&#34; &#40;interesting that this is a faster process than
  constructing the parent font&#41;, slightly darker, even, and legible. Things like
  the lc &#34;o&#34; need to change. Any suggestions on adjustments to individual
  glyphs would be appreciated. As would any other critique you have to offer. Oh,
  and Happy New Year!<!--attachment: frimbosans-56909.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*60.5*Very+rough+draft+of+Frimbo+Sans*frimbosans%2epdf

  body: Hey Noah <BR> <BR>Happy new year! <BR> <BR>I am by no means an expert in analyzing
    a typeface in any other way than as a user &#40;graphic designer&#41;.  I would
    say that this face seems to be strongest when used as a headline - when it is
    set as body it has a jittery-ness that could be good or could be bad, it would
    be somewhat hard to say right now. <BR> <BR>Is there anyway you could highlight
    your thoughts and process with deciding on the shapes of the letters.  For example
    the uppercase U and the lower case u share some traits but the curves seem somehow
    off - is this intentional &#40;as I assume it is&#41; - if so, what lead you to
    making them this way?

    it.
