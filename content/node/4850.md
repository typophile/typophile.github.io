body: 'Am I getting old or what? Yeah, It&#39;s rhetorical. <BR> <BR>I seem to be
  finding a lot of examples of bad color choices with type. The latest example that
  drove me nuts was from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design catalog for continuing
  education classes. Dark yellow type on lilac. You can download the equally irritating
  pdf by clicking on the &#34;Summer Course Catalog&#34; link from this page: <BR>
  <BR><a href="http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm</a>
  <BR> <BR>It reminds me of a local eatery called  The French Meadow Bakery -- their
  coffee menu is written in brick red chalk on a black chalkboard. I told a friend,
  &#34;If I hadn&#39;t had any, I sure as heck wouldn&#39;t be able to order it from
  that!&#34; <BR>'

  body: Uf! That&#39;s pretty bad. I did a vivid orange on a deep purple once ...
    I wanted it to be jarring, though, and it was only the headline.  <BR> <BR>I printed
    your catalog out on the color xerox, and the orange died a little, so the print-out
    is almost readable.  <BR> <BR>The cool thing about this is that it makes me feel
    good about my designs.

    the local AIGA new media conference. <BR> <BR>I showed them the web site: <BR><a

    <BR> <BR>And the unanimous response was: <BR> <BR>&#39;are you nuts? It&#39;s
    PINK and I can&#39;t read any of the type?&#39; <BR> <BR>Needless to say, the
    graphic design and typography of the awards didn&#39;t win over too many laypersons
    into thinking that these were reputable awards. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>As for MCAD,
    I could have understood the color choices for the undergrad catalog, but not continuing
    ed. I can&#39;t read a damn thing on that page. <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>My grandfather &#40;a farmer whose design instincts revolved around finding
    things that could be used for fences, gates, etc. on the farm&#41; was very fond
    of pink, and even painted two rooms in their house &#40;very pale&#41; pink. They
    also had a bunch of very cool art deco stuff that I couldn&#39;t appreciate as
    a kid. C&#39;est la vie.'

    the new black. I think it reached a recent saturation point at the end of the
    &#39;90s. Interestingly, this is when I first noticed &#40;late &#39;97&#41; the
    company <a href="http://www.orange.ch/">Orange</a> was pushing itself in Europe.

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I actually think orange is a great color, but it seems saddled
    with A&#41; warning connotations or B&#41; fad-ish associations. Or maybe that&#39;s
    just me... <BR>'

    take chances you aren&#39;t trying hard enough, and if you aren&#39;t trying hard
    you&#39;re doing a disservice to your clients. A designer who never goes overboard
    is a designer who does vanilla crap.

  body: There&#39;s a fine line between &#39;taking chances&#39; and &#39;pumping
    out crap&#39; though. <BR> <BR>But, then again, I&#39;m a jaded, cynical graphic
    designer who feels a lot of what we do these days &#40;or at least what gets press
    in the community&#41; has little to do with &#39;good design&#39; and more to
    do with &#39;pretty decorations&#39; a lot of the time. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Apparently,
    the AIGA show mentioned above didn&#39;t go over real well. Most of the entries,
    as usual, were pretty, but lacked in all sorts of other design criteria &#40;usability,
    accessibility, functionality, etc.&#41;. It&#39;s that kind of thing that bums
    me out.

    You can do things with RGB that you can&#39;t in print. <BR> <BR>But the real
    weakness with the type at the bottom is this: It is set in Base, famously with
    &#34;media specific&#34; versions -- and yet the face is not bitmapping correctly
    here, it is incorrectly used. THAT is poor typography &#40;for instance, look
    at the &#34;m&#34; with uneven stem spacing&#41;.'

    kinda. I think it&#39;s OK to go overboard, but it&#39;s not OK to make something
    unreadable in the process. Maybe I&#39;ve turned into a hack, but I always ask
    myself, &#34;Is this doing anything to enhance communication?&#34; If it&#39;s
    not helping, it gets cut. If it&#39;s actively hindering communication, it gets
    cut, thrown on the floor and stomped.  <BR> <BR>The orange on purple text in the
    pdf is almost impossible to read. The printout on my color printer is difficult
    to read. Without the actual printed piece, I don&#39;t know how difficult it was
    to read, but judging from Krisin&#39;s original reaction, it wasn&#39;t good.
    <BR> <BR>If a client is paying for a design, I think the designer has an obligation
    to make it usable/readable. An unreadable piece might not be vanilla, but it&#39;s
    probably not a success. <BR> <BR>Nick: are you talking about the cover, or the
    insides?'

    I&#39;m talking about the wrong thing. <BR> <BR>I had a look at the catalog just
    now, and the PDF of the inside pages is impossible to read. maybe the printed
    version  is OK, but they should have checked at the pdf if they&#39;re going to
    post it.
