body: "Are you a designer, and do you recruit staff? :)\r\n\r\nIf so, I would like
  to know your thoughts on resume submissions. Do you look at the fonts and identify
  them as a knock-off, a freebie, or a compromise? Do you base any judgement on the
  applicants choice of resume font? Do you even look at the leading and kerning? How
  would you feel if your next applicant submitted a resume entirely in default-spaced
  bold Verdana?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you select a perfectly weighted document from
  the heap of resumes - are you easily disappointed when it comes to checking their
  portfolio? How would you feel about a resume laid out as a landscape? :)\r\n\r\nThese
  are just a few of my many concerns :)"
