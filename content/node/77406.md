  there,\r\nI'm looking for any help to a font that is close to the one pictured above.
  The closest I've found is Adobe Garamond.... any guidance would be appreciated!"

  body: This typeface predates Adobe by at least ten years, so older cuts--like Stempel
    Garamond or Linotype Garamond--will probably match more closely.

  body: It doesn't match any Garamond I know, or any other face from that period for
    that matter. It's possible it was custom-drawn for the book. It looks almost like
    it was modeled on <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-GQ7E9N">Caslon Antique</a>, but
    cleaned up.
