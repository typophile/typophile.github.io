  body: "Could be wrong but looks like a custom job to me (part of the obvious too
    many rounded corners of course), something between [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-dax/|Dax]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/daxline/|Daxline]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sancoale/|Sancoale]]/[[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ubuntu|Ubuntu]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/solomon/|Solomon]]
    for /u, /m and /n and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tipografiaramis/decima-plus/|Decima+]].\r\nFor
    what it's worth, I would probably start with Decima+ and recreate it completely
    using /a to redraw /n, /m and /u."
