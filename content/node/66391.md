  background is needed: the University where I work and study is using the Angel LMS.
  The biblical language professors are trying to find a font that could be standardized
  for both Hebrew and Greek.* \r\n\r\nWhat are our options, considering the following
  requirements:\r\n<ul> <li>Unicode</li> <li>Must have support for Greek & Hebrew
  (must point correctly in Hebrew)</li> <li>License: something that would allow us
  to upload to our own server and distribute to registered students only** / or system
  font (cross-platform compliant)</li> </ul>\r\n\r\n*They're open to using separate
  fonts for Hebrew / Greek if needed.\r\n[EDIT] ** Through a secure LMS.\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate your help. \r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "Theunis, thanks. I've been of course looking at these options, but things
    are \"buggy\". Here's an example of what I mean by \"point correctly.\"\r\n\r\n(1)
    Serif font (Times) in our Learning Management System. Displayed fine on a Mac,
    but not on a PC...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrew_4347.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    realize it's probably not the font, but I was just wondering if we have any other
    options. System fonts seem to be tricky to work with (for platform considerations).\r\n\r\nWhat's
    happening is the professor is entering text through an HTML editor directly on
    a webpage. The above example is the result..."
