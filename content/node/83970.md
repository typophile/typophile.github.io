  like it to feel 'antique-old printing-press', without being too ornate and 'olde
  englishy' - something that has some flourishes, but not TOO many.  (I'm sorry i
  don't know the names of fonts off hand to reference.)\r\n\r\nI like the font used
  in the attached (from an old Bible) - anyone know what that is? - but it's a LITTLE
  too baroque/ elaborate.\r\n\r\nSuggestions are MUCH appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nRyan
