body: "After a night of gluttony and wine-drinking, I went through the comments from
  Craig (I did try making the thin serifs heavier, but they looked somewhat lopsided,
  so I left them like they are), and then made an in-between variant, so Grumpy now
  has three variants of optical sizes: Black 24, Black 72, and Black 99:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/G3_5964.png]\r\nAnd
  now back to gluttony and wine-drinking.\r\n"
