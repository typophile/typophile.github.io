  (1987) made, but from what I read never used, by Ladislas Mandel.\r\nIn 1983 ITT
  World Directories order to Ladislas Mandel some typefaces to be used in phone directories.
  The ideia was to create a type for specific regions: Lusitania for Latin countries,
  Nordica for Nordics and Lineale- more neutral.\r\nFrom my readings It was never
  used, and I want to know if anyone here has more info about this typaface.\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"
