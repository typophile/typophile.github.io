  I really just *don't* like it.\r\n\r\nIt's been pointed out to us, though, that
  not hyphenating our name might confuse some people. \"Is Durango your middle name?\"
  Would it be ignored altogether?\r\n\r\nLindsay Durango Beeson\r\nPatrick Durango
  Beeson\r\n\r\nI feel like there's a simple elegance to it.\r\n\r\nBut I'd like to
  ask you typophiles: is the hyphen interceding where it absolutely must intercede?
  Or do you think that, in the world today, people could simply come to understand
  that Durango Beeson is meant as a surname?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time,\r\nLindsay

  body: "Also sii, the problem with using the middle name is that some people have
    two first names, at least, it's quite common here in the South and I think in
    French/Spanish regions it's common with the equivalents of John.  In the South
    there's a lot of folk with two first names, a middle, and a last name.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an example with my name, lindsay's, sii's, and a friend of mine from Spain who
    has a whopping 5 (!) names and uses them all regularly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/surnames_smallcaps_5848.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
    actually a fan of the small cap treatment even if there's no confusion.  It gives
    a nice prominence to the family name.  Of course, I've never been told what the
    practice would be if the person only has one name like in parts of Africa.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    when they marry someone with a hyphenated surname?\r\n\r\nMy wife and I went through
    this same thing when we married 10 years ago. She didn't want to change her name
    for *professional* reasons...that and she liked her name as it was. I didn't want
    *one of those hyphenated names.* I changed my \"stage name\" to Michael Hoffmann
    Koppa, no hyphen...sorry, en dash...in an attempt to persuade her to do the same.
    She never did, and in day-to-day life I remained Mike Koppa. We had a child. Katrina's
    (our daughter) last name became Koppa. Vicki changed her name to Koppa. I dropped
    the Hoffmann bit. We're all just Koppas now...boring traditionalists. But it works.
    It's over.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, consider the future implications of a complex
    last name. How many times do yo want to explain it? We found it wasn't worth the

    ...\r\n\r\nI appreciate your insights, and though it is a personal decision, I
    obviously don't mind going into detail (considering the forum!). Patrick and I
    would pass our double name onto our children, who would of course reach an age
    (or a marriage or other union) for which they may want to alter it (simplify?
    add on to?).\r\n\r\nThe reason for the double name: I quite strongly identify
    as a Durango, but I want our family to have a singular identity, and Patrick is
    more than happy (I think he's actually quite excited) to take on my name as well.\r\n\r\nIt
    will make for a tongue-twister/mind-bender, but we aren't used to doing things
    the easy way. ... He proposed on top of a mountain, at the beginning of a \"spontaneous\"
    weekend trip to North Carolina during which he managed to lead me to suggest visiting
    the very mountaintop on which he had already planned to propose.\r\n\r\nWe're

    box to check alongside one's last name on a driver's license application. Small
    caps don't translate well into handwritten text. Hyphens are nearly inaudible
    when spoken. There are no small caps in braille, text messages, credit card receipts,
    &c..\r\nThe confusion is going to happen; not because of the way the information
    is arranged, but because of the information itself. That's the problem. You've

  body: "I would suppose the kids would keep both names and then each could pass on
    one name when they're kids (maybe a daughter would pass on lindsay's family's
    name, and her son would pass on her husband's, or something).  That, at least,
    is close the Iberian tradition, where the patrolineal name is passed down, but
    the husband's name is his dad's first-last name (his grandpa's contributed name)
    and his mom's first-last name.  The wife then has several options, she can be
    her dad's last name + of + her husbands last name, or her husband's last name
    + her dad's last name.  And in Spanish society today, the order and the patro/matralineality
    of the names is optional and freely changeable and either name can be passed down
    as per parent's preference, with the child able to reorder it once they turn 18
    if they so choose.  Spaniards do father's name then mother's name, and the Portuguese
    do the reverse.  A little odd I suppose for us Americans, but these days with
    so many people taking double last names it's not a bad model to follow  (both
    of theirs can actually be extended as long as you want, though officially you
    can only use two first names and two names in each of the two last names, eg,
    your four grandparent's families' names is the max in an official name).\r\n\r\nEither
    way, the union of the names is only a superficial reference to a far deeper and
    more important union, so I think whatever you go with, will ultimately work out
    for y'all.  You could always just write down all the options and pick it out of
    a hat :)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos
