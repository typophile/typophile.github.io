  body: "Uhm, you could be right.\r\n\r\nI was looking for bold type and the different
    R on the Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed Bold was misleading me.  (see pic for reference.)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<img

  body: The crossbar on the A seems to be higher on the CRAFT sample, but still  I'll
    go with your suggestion.

  body: It could be an Akzidenz Grotesk <strong>Light</strong> Condensed, artificially
    emboldened. The crossbar of /A/ is higher and the /R/ will be more "square" as
    in your sample.
