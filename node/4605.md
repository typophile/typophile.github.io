  body: Well... it it&#39;s &#34;piquant&#34; maybe you should consider using more
    red on your logo <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: first of all I think you should make clear in your mind how the restaurant
    want to &#34;sell&#34; itself. It is a taugh task since it is you that will be
    the client. It is good to be a little Dr. Jeckyl and Mr Hyde here. For the begining
    think as a businessman. Put restrictions and rules as a client puts and don&#39;t
    consider in the first place the &#34;design&#34;. It is a good lesson to make
    the design work for the idea and not the opposite. <BR> <BR>Further, about what
    you have right now is that you miss the process i described before. You seem not
    to have a clear concept of the work. If it is about Mediterranean food you have
    to consider that one of the most strong i.d. characteristics is history/tradition
    and warm colours. I would recommend to start a small research about &#34;what
    mediterranian style&#34; is and after you have a clear view about it, then you
    can go beyond and put your own option of &#34;how I see Mediterranian style&#34;.
    Then you can step on your research and create your aspect as much &#34;modernist&#34;
    or retro you want to be. <BR> <BR>For the moment i see no food and no mediterranian
    style. <BR> <BR>Hope that i was helpfull and not disturbing. Wish a creative and
    sunny day. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: Jeremy, I don&#39;t understand the blue shape and the letter spacing needs
    alot of work. Its almost as if the space between letters increases as the word
    developes.

    red acute might be nice. <BR> <BR>&#42; Pepper-shaped? Oh, that&#39;s too Chili&#39;s.

  body: The type isn&#39;t &#34;sitting&#34; in that box very happily. Although the
    name is French, I thought of sushi. I don&#39;t think it needs to be overall red
    and spicy. Great chefs, ergo great food, has just the right amount of spice to
    achieve the desired flavor. I do think you need to explore type a more. What were
    some of your other initial thoughts/sketches?

  body: I think of a new-media company when I see your current logo. I think it&#39;s
    the shades of blue and grey and the italic sans face. <BR> <BR>Mediterranean style
    for me holds connotations of earth tones with bold accents, especially red, gold,
    and ultramarine. Lots of filigree/embellishment as well. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d consider
    using a small cap from a &#34;distinguished&#34; serif face; does FF Acanthus
    have a SC?

  body: yea i agree with most people here, it doesn&#39;t fit for the type of restaurant
    you described. <BR> <BR><b>Christos&#39; post above is exactly right.</b> <BR>define
    your concept before you even touch the computer.  write down words that come to
    mind about the restarurant, look for imagery associated with the type of restaurant
    it is, photos and drawings and such, and draw little pictures of things and letters
    and anything else.  remember, all this before you touch the computer.  seriously,
    it&#39;s been tried and proven--it works out better in the end. <BR> <BR>also,
    give your logo some breathing room &#40;a little bit of white space around it&#41;
    even if just to show us a draft. presentation is half of it.
