  word \"Streets\". He says he's seen it used for a few different games. I know the
  two S are not the same, but I'd gamble that if you rotated and stretched the second
  they would be. Anyhoo, ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soronline.gif]"

    be/probably is. I'll see if the games he has are all from the same company.\r\n\r\nOn
    the one hand the lettershapes could have been filtered. On the other hand Gaming
    companies are notoriously cheap and will do all they can not to pay for something
    like this. So it would make sense ... sort of. \r\n\r\nEither way I wasn't thinking
    it was some award winning obvious typeface, but some cheap, waste of server space,
    typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: I think the WTF MyFonts board got it. They ID'd it as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/polo-d/">Polo</a>.
    I could see this working after some more filtering and distortion. I'll call that
    good enough for this.

  body: "i'm pretty sure \"Streets of Rage\" is an old videogame from way back when
    you could actually count the pixels on your tv, and that image is most likely
    a screen capture taken directly from the opening of the game (from an newer emulated
    version of it).. so that whole image/logo was probably built pixel for pixel.
    not based on any font, most likely.\r\n\r\nand rather than handlettered, i'd call
    this one handpixeled."

  body: "I shoulda guessed this as Handlettered as Patty ID'd it. I know better. I
    was actually just hoping for something similar. There is so much crap out there
    now I figured something like this must exist. My friend showed me the samples
    and they were from two different companies so it has been decided that they used
    the same artist to create both titles.\r\n\r\nCheers."
