    Vive le Typophile! <BR> <BR>Hhp, Hector &amp; Santi; Botanical, eh? I like that.
    <BR> <BR>Adriano; I created the typeface in Illustrator but it was based on the
    circular forms found in the Bauhaus typeface... or maybe it was just based on
    circles :o&#41; Bauhaus looks alot like the Lisboa logo you&#39;d posted, though...
    then again, I&#39;m still kind of new at noticing the subtle differences between
    seemingly similar faces. <BR> <BR>Randy; I also made this connection and was afraid
    that everyone else would too... it&#39;s not a bad thing to be, but, for this
    project I was looking for something else. I was really surprised to see that not
    everyone made the youth-culture connection, but, I was mostly relieved. <BR> <BR>-craig

    subsequent viewings I haven&#39;t seen that as much, but maybe that was influenced

    I&#39;ve re-worked the logo a bit and am posting it here in the context of the
    first issue&#39;s cover... we&#39;re going to be looking for contributors &#40;artists,
    photographers, writers, designers, illustrators and, yes, even typographers&#41;
    soon, so, if you are interested in becoming a contributor... you know, Bookmark
    the site or send an email to <a href="mailto:info@formandform.net">info@formandform.net</a>.
    Stay tuned for info and feel free to spread the word. <BR> <BR>Thometz: Yeah,
    it&#39;s very similar... it wasn&#39;t intentional, but, it&#39;s funny how that

  body: Craig -- This pic, above, is this how you will use the logo? Sorry for my
    peacock comment. However, with the letters separated from the shapes, well I really
    do like it more this way.  For me, it is stronger and more unique. The idea of
    separating the letters from the shapes.

- body: Kind of cool that the front cover looks somewhat industrial; my very first
    observation was that it looks like the clover intersections on interstates, and
    Bauhaus-y. <BR>When the logo is apart from the shape, doesn&#39;t the new negative
    space bother anyone? <BR>I think because it is on a busy background that it isn&#39;t
    so noticeable, but the bg improves the logo. <BR>Its also very hard to get the
    word &#39;and&#39; out of it. <BR>The overall feel to it is very memorable though,
    and for a smaller magazine where &#39;knowing about a small secret magazine&#39;
    will be one of its strengths &#40;possibly? only guessing&#41; having a logo that
    takes a slight amount of work to figure out actually seems fitting.  <BR>What
    is the reason that the word is &#39;and&#39;? <BR>
