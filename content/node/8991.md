  body: hey guys, <BR>thanks, and yes i guess i got more hair on my chest than most
    of you got all over... so why not decorate with them ah? <BR> <BR>it all started
    from looking too long at Dalliance Flourish... and now that is the result. but
    a hair stroke is a pretty neat material to work with <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Positively follicular! <BR> <BR>My only criticism would be that the characters
    in the font that were created by mirroring or flipping variations of the same
    shape &#40;the more pattern-like glyphs, that is&#41; are much less interesting
    than the raw component shapes. I think the example that Armin produced is a perhaps
    more effective use.

  body: thanks Grant, <BR>i agree, indeed i only included three mirror-like shapes
    to see how people react and i think im going to cut them out.  <BR>the mirrors
    are more of a way to use it rather than a stand alone shape. <BR>thanks for your
    input

  body: Are you still developing additional characters for this font? I&#39;d be curious
    to see how many variations you can <i>pluck</i> out of it... <BR> <BR>{ ouch }

  body: the process was taking the hair taping each seperately and then mixing the
    shapes i got. after i was happy with one of the form i scanned it and traced it.
    than i increased the contrast, so it will work even in a small size and different
    printers.  <BR>i have tones of shapes, but at some point you understand &#40;and
    i know it sounds awkward but that is just the way it is&#41; that hair is some
    what like a snow falck i mean, all the shapes are different and exciting, and
    it is an endless resource.  <BR>so i just stoped at some point to collect them,

  body: Could you explore split ends too? Or straight hairs as discretionary ligatures?

  body: that is a pretty briliant remark. honestly i didn&#39;t think of htat. i was
    striked by the idea of stroke=hair and the way the stroke weight is changing in
    hairs. meaning the width of the line of a hair is working different than a pen.
    but what you say opens up so many options. i think that would be the next step.
    exploring the split ends. ligatures seems interesting as well. i think i might
    cpme pu with set of shapes that will work as connecting shapes betweeb two existing
    shapes. but forgive my ignorance &#40;english is my second language&#41; what
    do you mean by &#34;discretionary&#34;?
