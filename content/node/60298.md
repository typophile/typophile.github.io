  body: You posted 5600 photos from Atlanta? I guess I saved some money by not going
    ... you must have a photo a minute of the show there. Now all I need to do is
    find the time to watch them.

  body: 'I think 5600 is from the whole series of TypeCons on Flickr. Which I should
    note pre-date me. Also, I would like to thank Emma Williams for being co-photographer
    this year. She is a fine type designer and a MATD grad too BTW! And there are
    plenty of photos from attendees. That said I would not be surprised if we post
    2k photos this year. One per minute is about right. 1 in 10 might be worth putting
    up which is as much as I choose to err. '

    not covered. Any idea when you'll be adding the rest?

    one, even though it's four days early?\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/chibachiba/3708108391/in/pool-typecon\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I'm not getting why there's all that non-TypeCon stuff in there,\r\nincluding
    3D art?! Inclusiveness is one thing, not caring is another.\r\nIt's not like there's
    a limit on the number of different Flickr groups.\r\nI think the TypeCon pool
    should have, like, actual TypeCon photos only...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Some people take years to post their TypeCon photos :) So there is some Seattle
    stuff mixed in with ATL. We're asking people to tag better... we'll see how it
    goes.\r\n\r\nWe are now weeding through the images to try to get rid of those
    that are not related to SOTA/TypeCon in any way. Some people have a tendency to
    post their portfolio pieces, even non-typographic, to our groups and dozens of
    others. We're trying to clean up, but it's taking a little time..."
