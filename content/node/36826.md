body: When I outline a stroke in Illustrator CS3, it creates two stacked points for
  every one it should create, one controlled by the incoming handle and one controlled
  by the outgoing handle. This make editing the curves a nightmare. Does anyone know
  of a workaround?

    \ Because this way it is impossible to draw in Illustrator, \r\nit becomes totally
    useless."

  body: "Don't know if this works but it's worth a shot. So here is the idea though
    it may take a little time for each point.\r\n\r\nMove one of the points up by
    the arrow key. Delete the path in between. Move the path down by the arrow key
    again. Select the two points and choose join path.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, but that is redicoulously complicated. It just looks like Adobe has
    destroyed the 'Outline stroke' option, it is borked. In CS2 it worked perfectly,
    placing only one node everywhere, instead of two stacked on top of each other.\r\n\r\nIf
    I have a drawing with hundreds of points, of which I want to move say 50, your
    method would be a lot of work. ;) Needless to say that 'Outline stroke' is totally
    unusable at the moment."

    a thick fat bug in Illustrator CS3?"

    install anyway, because the patcher insists that I have a file with a bad checksum...I
    don\u2019t have time for this BS right now..."

    with the doubled points).\r\n\r\n2. Option-click (or on Windows, Alt-click) on
    the top-left button on the Pathfinder palette (the one that merges shapes)."

    forums myself. I'll give Mark's suggestion a try until some sort of patch arrives.

    Cider to port Corel Draw to my Mac. I just got Corel Draw 12 on eBay for $50 because
    I wanted the fonts, maybe I\u2019ll end up using the software, too."

    every time I use Illustrator, that would really mess up my workflow.

  body: "And if that\u2019s not bad enough, Adobe\u2019s patch utility for Illustrator
    doesn\u2019t work very well, and the workaround is to keep uninstalling, reinstalling,
    and attempting to patch until it does. I guess that\u2019s better than the CS1/CS2
    days when bugs just didn\u2019t get fixed, but it\u2019s not something I have
    time to deal with right now."

  body: To overcome the idiot factor of the programmers, I select the hollow arrow
    tool, click and drag to select the points that are stacked on top of one another.
    Then (still using the hollow arrow tool) I can click selected points and drag
    to make adjustments.

  body: I'm so happy that other people have found this problem too. I was beginning
    to question my sanity as no one I asked about it hadn't noticed anything strange.
    This totally ruins the workflow when designing logos and custom letterforms. I
    hope this gets fixed soon. Has Adobe been bombarded with notifications about this?
    They should be.
