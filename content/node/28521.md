    on the Book_Arts-L list (http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/bookarts/)
    recently: the general consensus of the conservators is that it probably wouldn't
    be archival, and that one may well pick up something \"nasty\" on the germ front.\r\n\r\nOTOH,
    I'll certainly post these links there and see what happens, and the first one
    would be great in my fibre guild's newsletter....  ;-)\r\n\r\nLinda"

  body: "Our local zoo sells elephant poop-paper.\r\n\r\nFor the record, these papers
    are likely much more archival than tree-based (as the plant matter used has much
    longer fibers). When made into paper, you're really not keeping the 'poop'...just
    the semi-digested fibers. Ruminants are really ineffecient animals in terms of
    digestion...most of what goes into them comes back out."

  body: "The real concern is not the plant fibres <em> per se </em> -- it's whatever
    else that gets trapped in the fibres, as even a good washing isn't going to get
    rid of everything.  For example, the USDA (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantproducts/soil.html)
    has some pretty picky rules about importing soil (and the constituents thereof)
    and even if what is brought into the country isn't bad (hello, Dutch elm disease)
    for the environment, it may well alter the chemistry, especially pH, of the paper.\r\n\r\nYour
    heffalumps probably produce great paper -- ours produce \"Zoo Doo\" garden nutrient.

    I just hope such ecological innovations are applied to inks and toners.
