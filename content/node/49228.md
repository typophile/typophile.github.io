  I tried to practice and generate a simple helvetica-like sans serif type for my
  own use. There is much work to do - most shapes require work I am aware of that.
  I would like to get some feedback if possible. I know some letters are irregular
  (unequal stem width etc.)... \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any feedback.\r\n\r\nUPDATE
  (10/22/08):\r\njust a sketch to get an idea where this is heading.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test-v5vtt_5797.PNG]"

    I think it's already a success! If you want to push it further...\r\n \r\nMonolines
    can be <em>tough</em>. Getting that stroke weight optically consistent should
    be your first priority.\r\n\r\nIt does look an awful lot like Helvetica. I think
    you could afford to take some more liberties, go a little crazy, then pull it
    back.\r\n\r\nThe vertical cut on the arms of the K and k is at odds with the rest
    of the terminals (maybe this feature is something you can play with to differentiate
    your typeface from other monolines). The hook on the G, and to a degree the tail
    of the Q, feel a little more forced than the rest of your solutions; they might
    warrant a little more sketching.\r\n\r\nKeep going and keep learning!"

    The vertical cut in k, K was deliberate although I am aware that it might not
    fit well with the other letters. \r\n\r\nCurrently I am struggling with the Beziers...I
    have some difficulties controlling them and making smooth curves. After that I
    will definitely try to give the fonts a more distinctive appearance. I used TypeLight
    (Type 2.2 free version) and most of the fonts were drawn using Truetype points,
    initially mostly by eye, and then tried to measure the fonts dimensions and make
    them equal - so the the results are not yet satisfactory.\r\n\r\nP.S. One of the
    things I tried to do is to give some of the fonts a more squared appearance -
    this is not really visible very well at small sizes. \r\n"

    that rest on the baseline {a,b,c,d,e,g,o,p,q,s,u}.  Typically the rounded characters
    rest slightly below the baseline, or slightly above the x-height or cap-height.
    \ They look unintentionally forced to me.\r\n\r\nThe vertical chop on the k's
    arm looks kind of lonely, maybe incorporate that in some of the other terminals
    somehow."

  body: "Thanks for the comments Eric. You are right about bowls and round elements.
    \r\n\r\nI intentionally tried to align them with the baseline/x-height. This was
    because when using the font in Microsoft Word, some of bowls/curves (at certain
    font sizes) were rendered very distorted. I did not known how to correct for this
    and I though that changing the alignment with the  baseline/x-height might solve
    the problem which it did not. \r\n\r\nIn any case I would be very curious how
    one should draw the outlines to avoid situations like the ones indicated in the
    image bellow (Word snapshot with font displayed at various sizes).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test_carpathica-sans_version

    it is meant for print, then it should be of little concern to you how it looks

    You\u2019re doing the same thing the Arial team did: trying to make a font with

    something that allows you to really focus on coming up with something that just
    works on its own. "

  body: "Thanks for the comments James. \r\nI am definitely aware of the \"Arial situation\".
    I agree with you on some of the concerns raised and I really appreciate your input.
    \r\n\r\n>>\"Erik Spiekermann likes to point out that, for what it is, Helvetica
    is perfect. Arial is a knockoff of Helvetica, and a knockoff of perfect must be
    imperfect. \"\r\n\r\nI am sure the issue has been overly discussed among professionals,
    however, I am really curious to what extent can we consider that a certain design
    has reached \"perfection\", and thus any further modifications would necessarily
    mean a departure from the ideal form - in other words a closed matter. I would
    like to read more about this issue.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I do tend to favor the
    idea that this is quite a relative matter. I might be wrong, as I do not have
    formal training in this area, but I think that terms such as \"perfect\" may be
    too rigid for describing a type. While one could say that a certain shape is perfect
    from a technical standpoint there is also a lot of subjectivity in appreciating
    its  aesthetics. \r\n\r\nWhile I agree with you that modifying a masterpiece has
    little chance to lead to another one, we also know that most beginners start by
    imitating them. From the little I know of type design I kind of get the impression
    that many of the fonts that are used today have   \"evolved\" from other pre-existent
    designs. That kind of makes me think that type design can be subject to \"evolution\".
    On the other hand it might be true that the Arial Team did not intend at all to
    further refine and develop the \"Helvetica design\" but just to have a slightly
    modified \"clone\". \r\n \r\nWhile it is true that I had Helvetica in mind when
    I was drawing the shapes, I freely drew them without any external visual help.
    As a consequence version 1 came out almost identical to Helvetica (excluding at
    this point the fact that there are a lot of technical problems).  \r\n\r\nThat
    in fact adds support to your theory, in the sense that when having a certain pattern
    in mind and trying to get the \"perfect\" shape you end  up in the same place.
    On the other hand it can also mean that we are so used (\"conditioned\") to this
    shapes (we can draw them from mind) that we consider them perfect.  \r\n\r\n\r\n>>\"I
    know that you\u2019re doing this as a learning experience, but I think you\u2019re
    getting into a negative feedback loop, because to refine you can\u2019t really
    do anything but hack and tweak\" \r\n\r\nI am not sure whether you are saying
    that the particular modifications that I made are bad, or you just think that
    anybody who will try to do such a thing will end up \"mutilating\" Helvetica.\r\n\r\n
    \r\n>>\"You\u2019re putting all of your energy into trying to force something
    good and original\"\r\n\r\nAs a beginner, I would really appreciate some feedback
    on the original aspect of Helvetica. From what I read it appears to me that Helvetica
    was also designed based on a previous type.  Just for curiosity i put together
    several fonts including Helvetica Arial, and Akzidenz Grotesk (that I think preceded
    Helvetica). Arial looks almost indistinguishable from Helvetica, and Akzidenz
    also looks very similar to me. I added the first and fourth versions of my font,
    and included a detail of version 4 at the bottom (vs Helvetica light) for you
    to compare - pointing out certain elements that were consistently changed for
    all glyphs. \r\n\r\nThanks for input, and I hope that with more practice I can
    reach a point were the font will not look just like a collection of semi-random
    tweaks. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SansSerifs_comparison-2_5915.PNG]"
