body: "This font is similar to Eras, though not exactly the same. Among its differences
  are there is no slant, and there are tails above and below some letters. There are
  some other more basic differences, the \"4\" for example is quite different from
  Eras.\r\n\r\nThis font is used very frequently by the Washington, DC Metro system.\r\n\r\nI
  know there is a version of Eras without the slant floating around that's from a
  hybrid print font from the late 80s. This is NOT that.\r\n\r\nCan anyone ID? Thanks
  in advance."
