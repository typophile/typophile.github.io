  people bending and twisting to form the shapes of the letters. But now that I need
  it I can't seem to find one anywhere. Specifically I need the numbers from such
  a font. Does anyone know the name of such a font or where I could find it.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nJohn"

    be appropriate  <smile>\r\n\r\nAzizMostafa: Interesting idea for a new project
    but not for the one I need help with at the moment.  <smile>\r\n\r\nLeeMc: I did
    see Rad but the skater thing doesn't work for the theme of the project. And I
    did see Cutout but it might be a little too stylized for what we're after.\r\n\r\nJohn"

    for numbers composed of people (kids preferably) posed as numbers.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for the pointers but perhaps it's time to give up the quest. Or maybe hire
    an illustrator."
