body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI am in the process of developing a font with FontLab (I am a
  newbie to it) and I want to know if I can get some aid from you. \r\n\r\nFontLab
  will freeze when trying to export the characters to OpenType. It will be OK when
  generating TrueType, though. When trying to generate either format, an error message
  pops up stating that some characters contain open contours.\r\n\r\nSo, question
  1:\r\n\r\nAny idea of why FontLab will freeze through the export dialog when generating
  the OT font? The TT Font weighs 406 Kbs so far and contains around 500 characters.\r\n\r\nQuestion
  2:\r\nDo you know of any FontLab forum that can be accessed through a) Outlook and/or
  b) web?\r\n\r\nQuestion 3 (a bit off the main theme):\r\nHow can I turn the colour
  red off the glyph cells that are supposed to have open contours once I've made sure
  that the contours are closed? (No more nodes marked with an X). When I re-open the
  font the cells are still marked red.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMosh"

    an OTF font, and you have the \"Export only OpenType name records\" option off
    in Preferences, <em>and</em> you have not filled in the \"Other Names\" page in
    the Font Info screens, FontLab will quit unexpectedly (OS X).\r\n\r\n2) http://groups.msn.com/FontLab/_whatsnew.msnw
    \ (The fact that it is hosted through MSN Groups sucks, but the good news is that
    at some point in the near future it will move to FontLab's own site, according
    to the FontLab people.)\r\n\r\n3) You have to manually \"turn off\" the red marks
    after fixing the glyphs--they are a nice touch, but not dynamically self-updating.
    Right-click on a glyph cell and choose Mark > None. BTW, you can use this marking
    facility however you want, for example, to help keep track of glyphs you are working
    on. I have even seen Python scripts that mark characters with different colors
    based on certain criteria. I'm not quite that sophisticated myself (yet)."
