body: "Hi typophiles! I've been looking frantically for this font. A printer told
  me it is an old letterpress font used several decades ago. I'm very keen to get
  my hands on the digital equivalent.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a fixed-width sans. It
  reminds me of the typeface used for embossing serial numbers in metal plates.\r\n\r\nHope
  you guys can help me out.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
