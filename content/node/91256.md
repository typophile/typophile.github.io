body: "My post might be better related to the typographic education section but I
  would like some general feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm teaching a type class, the last of
  a series of 4 in a graphic design diploma.\r\nLucky me I only have 4 students so
  we get to push things a bit more than usual. The next project is supposed to be
  'Typobjets' (type made from objects) but some of them have done something similar
  in another class so I'm thinking of opening up the project and turn it into making
  a collective typography. \r\n\r\nEach student would have 13 glyphs (if we only do
  uppercase and lowercase, not sure how much we can squeeze in, I'll probably have
  to adjust). It would be more interesting if we could also get some punctuation and
  the accents done so they can actually use it.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of letting them
  pick their letters within the whole but I'm also thinking it might be better if
  each of them get a more difficult letter, a round letter, etc. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm
  thinking of asking them to have one handdrawn letter, one letter sculpted (potato
  maybe), one modular letter, one object letter, one letter found in nature, etc.
  I'm hoping that by setting some categories that the end product will be less of
  a visual mess.\r\n\r\nAnyone care to share their thoughts on this? \r\nAnyone did
  a similar project and ran into problems?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm thinking it would be cool
  to turn it into a font but I haven't messed with that kind of software in a while.
  What would be my best bet? I don't think it would have to be some very complex software
  since it's probably the kind of font they would have to kern it by hand anyway.
  Suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\xC9milie"

    they sculpt one in a potato, they would stamp it and trace it afterwards or if
    they find a branch that looks like a Y, we'd take a pic and trace that. I think
    it would help if it can all be the same color because it's going to look way too
    chaotic otherwise.\r\n\r\nPhotofont seems interesting but I'm really thinking
    of a standard font. Maybe we could try Photofont as a second option though, thanks
    for the lead! I remember using FontLab when I was learning glyph drawing back
    in Uni. Does it still hold as standard for font creation?"

  body: "I retired from teaching graphics three years ago. One of the 'issues' I had
    constantly to tackle was the students' reliance on digital technology. Letterform,
    to most of them, meant a typeface from a menu list.\r\n\r\nI tried to persuade
    them to think out of the digital box by running a series of classes which were
    all about creating letters; letters which were out of any context and were not
    for anything. The students were allowed to use any materials they had or could
    acquire, except a computer or a camera, to make letters. It sounds a touch like
    your typobjects maybe, although I'm not 100% sure what you mean by that. The branch
    that looks like a Y? Or arranging (for example) bricks into an L?\r\n\r\nYes we
    did get some of that kind of thing and, over the years, many letters made from
    dried pasta but also got some fabulously creative work such as a two-storey g
    made from strips of coloured thread woven into a piece of chicken wire\u2014and
    I mean woven, not just threaded through. Another one I loved was a found, dried-out,
    trodden-on tea bag squashed onto a piece of discarded card which together formed
    a wonderfully grungie a or d or p, we never did decide.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind
    this was, clearly, to break the reliance on digital type and to get them to look
    and think hard about letters as shapes.\r\n\r\nWe would spend maybe two or three
    sessions on this and then I would contrast this with two or three very disciplined
    sessions in which they were given an example letter from a carefully chosen typeface
    (the example would be an A4 print) and they were required to draw the letter accurately
    at least three times in different media at A1 size.\r\n\r\nAs with all these things,
    it works well for some and not for others. But more than one student told me in
    later years that when they went on to a higher-level course, they became the letterform
    expert amongst their peers."

    a lot of variety! I totally agree with washishu about getting away from the computer.
    I did give some slack on this though because I'm teaching evening classes so my
    students often work full time and then go to class at night. They don't have a
    whole bunch of time to go take photos while daylight is out.\r\n\r\nWe did the
    round robin thing as oldnick suggested and I let them exchange some letters afterwards
    because one of them had a bunch of numbers and almost no lower caps. I gave them
    a few abstract categories and asked them to cover at least 5 of them.\r\n\r\nMy
    categories are :\r\nA handdrawn letter\r\nA molded/sculpted/woven letter\r\nA
    letterform found in nature\r\nA letterform found in the city\r\nA remixed letterform\r\nA
    modular letterform\r\nA pixel letterform\r\nA hybrid letterform\r\nA letterform
    found at bird's eye view (such as Google Earth)\r\nA letter found in the past
    (retro signs, etc.)\r\n\r\nWill keep you posted :-)"

  body: "I think the approach might be more aimed at what makes a group of letters
    become a typeface.  My suggestion would be that each student be assigned to design
    one letter for a typeface, the lowercase \"n\" without copying an existing face.
    \ The next step would be for everyone in the class to exchange their letter n
    with another classmate by un-named lottery.  The second person would be tasked
    with designing the lowercase letter \"q\" based on the n they were given.  The
    point being that they would have to figure out the system the first person intended
    and attempt to follow it. Next comes another lottery to trade with a 3rd person
    who would draw the lowercase \"a\" from the n and q they received. The lottery
    and trading would continue until 5 different glyphs were made by 5 different students,
    each trying to make a glyph that fits with the others. I would choose, in order,
    n q a s v.  You should end up with a set of 5  glyphs for everyone in the class
    with each of the 5 drawn by a different person.  Their should be some interesting
    comparisons and a healthy dialogue among the classmates when everything is put
    up for viewing and critique.\r\nIt is important to not use peoples names, just
    assign some number code per student.  You want to remove the dynamic of who the
    personalities of the people are and focus on the personality of the given glyph.\r\n\r\nI
    would have them draw by hand with pencil or marker (no compass, ruler or french
    curve tools allowed) but not a flat edged calligraphic tool which can dictate
    form.  Forget the computer for a while. That will come later. This should not
    be about either drafting skills or software skills.  It should be about looking
    and analyzing.\r\n\r\nThe only limitation would be that the x-height of all the
    glyphs in the entire project should be the same. This would be so that scale is
    not an issue.  After all is done, you can mix glyphs with other sets to bring
    to light what happens with differing systems of approach."

    agree at all that because one reads or gets involved in a forum it means that
    they cannot think for themselves. I am guessing you are referring to students
    who explicitly come here asking to get their comps fixed up which is definitely
    not everyone's case. I've been hanging around Typophile for almost 10 years on
    and off and I used to read the boards almost everyday when I was doing my BA.
    I learned a lot from reading the threads and I felt that the boards were bringing
    me a huge complement of information. Had I not thought it was a great resource
    back then, I wouldn't be here today. \r\n\r\nOn a whole different note, I ran
    into your tweet about my thread : <cite>On @Typophile, \u201CDo My Homework Syndrome\u201D
    \u2014 http://bit.ly/iSCQJ6 \u2014 has devolved into \u201CDevelop My Coursework\u201D
    syndrome \u2014</cite>\r\n\r\nI would obviously prefer if you told me straight
    up that you have a problem with me posting on the forum for feedback on a type
    education project instead of tweeting about it behind my back making it look like
    I'm asking for someone to come up with a project for me. Are you paranoid about
    people coming here for feedback and answers? I'm sure it happens a lot...otherwise
    it wouldn't be a forum, would it?\r\n\r\nWashishu : Google Images wasn't so popular
    when I was in school but I experienced first hand that it has taken over tonight!
    I had to insist quite a bit for them to get off it. If it wasn't for the fact
    that they are people who already work full time as well as taking classes in the
    evenings, I'd probably forbid using a computer for the research steps of the project.
    I was surprised, I actually thought they would be happy to get away from the machine
    since they normally spend all day on it. I know for one if someone told me to
    go out for a walk to find and take photos of letterforms I wouldn't hesitate one
    bit to get away from the screen. Instead I felt from them that I was taking away
    their lifeline. I think I managed to correct the direction and that next week
    will be better. After an hour, the new glyphs were way more original than their
    first research with Google.\r\n\r\nDezcom : Beautiful project idea, love it! I
    thought about something similar before for moodboards. I wanted each student to
    develop a moodboard for a specific project and then have them exchange it with
    another student so that they would have to come up with a design that would respect
    the other's moodboard. Didn't get around to do that yet but I'm planning to when
    I get a little more teaching experience. I like how your idea can involve way
    more people working on the same thing. It also offers for more variety and I think
    it could work at any level.\r\n\r\nHrant / Dezcom / riccard0 : Thank you for the
