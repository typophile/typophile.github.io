  and real italics. The character set is still very basic. Please feel free to share
  your critique as harshly and honestly as possible. Ohh and, spacing/kerning is indesign's
  'optical' job. \r\n\r\nCheers! jasper"

  body: Looking really fine, so far! Me thinks that the diagonals in the extra bold
    weight in letters such as w and y are too light.

  body: "This is quite polished! Good job. It's reminiscent of a few things (like
    Beorcana) but I think it has enough individuality to survive.\r\n\r\nMy main gripe
    -as before*- is the vertical proportions: you're clearly vying for text setting,
    and when the descenders are too long compared to the ascenders (yours seem to
    be exactly equal**) you're basically wasting \"space potential\" because in Latin-using
    languages ascenders are much more common. Although the descenders, being more
    complex, need more room to elaborate themselves, they still can't be given all
    that room to waste. The reference point I've personally arrived at is this: the
    \"g\" must look slightly cramped.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/85355#comment-502929\r\n\r\n**
    Gerrit Noordzij's Ruse does this, and that's its biggest flaw.\r\n\r\nOne other
    thing: with six weights (BTW, I personally like seeing a large number) you have
    to think clearly about what you want their relationships to be, and then do a
    good deal of testing at various sizes (and non-ideal printing conditions) while
    intermixing the weights, inline. Every type design class should have a full lesson
    on squinting!  :-)\r\n\r\nOh, and that \"Q\"... it's trying too hard. It's the
    only glyph that I think needs to be re-thought.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think the swash alternates are the weakest part, and I would even consider
    dropping the roman swashes. They seem forced.\r\n\r\nDid you try non-horizontal
    tops to the bolder roman /M/ (given the angled terminals of letters like /V/v/)?\r\n\r\nFWIW
    I think the extender lengths seem fine, but I do agree about checking weights
    of letters like /w/ (and not only in the extra bold). "

  body: "@hrant: I don't want my g to look cramped. Sensato is not made for space
    efficiency. Making the descenders appear as long as the ascenders gives the most
    'natural' look, imo.\r\n@J Weltin: I'll have a look at those :-)\r\n@Craig: I
    don't mind them looking a bit forced, if that's what it takes to draw the attention.
    The /M/ actually has slightly angled terminals on the top. If I make it more angled
    it looks forced, which, in this case, is not desirable."

  body: I like it, although some glyphs appear to have more contrast than others.
    Maybe try making the tail of the lowercase 'a' raise up a little less.

    look of them that doesn't fit so much. But swashes are discretionary so leaving
    them in isn't going to <cite>stop</cite> anyone buying it! But making them better
    could persuade someone to...\r\nThe S and s in the romans look slightly falling
    forward to me."

  body: "I think you are very close. My concern is mainly with some of the rounded
    letters: O Q C G S, and lc like o and c. I think, comparing especially the O to
    the E, you'll find that E appears to be have a little more contrast, where O seems
    to feel nearly monoline. Looking again, it may not be as much of a problem as
    I imagined. It's all evened out in heavier weights.\r\n\r\nT: I thought there
    were just screen rendering issues, but the top is actually quite wobbly. I imagine
    this either must be a glitch or an accident. :) This seems to only be plaguing
    the small cap T in the regular weight.\r\n\r\nAnyway, lovely family you got going
    there. ;)"
