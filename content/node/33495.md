  knowledge to draw my second weight of my [[italic]] typeface. So far, I drew the
  roman in thin, light, regular, bold and black. I also drew the regular italic. So,
  I wonder which way is the best one: start from the italic and drawing the bold weight
  or start from the roman bold and draw the bold italic. \r\n\r\nThank you to share
  your experiment."

    actually. One normally is using the contours from the italic, and information
    from the Bold to make the bold Italic. But I do not think, once one has an italic,
    that one should go back to the bold contours for anything but a visual reference. "

  body: "Here's how I do it. Start from your Italic outlines. Since the point placement
    and structure will be pretty much the same, you'll be in a much better starting
    position.\r\n\r\nI put a copy of the original Italic in the template/mask/background
    (different terms, same thing, depending upon your software) of the Bold Italic,
    to compare with. I also keep open a glyph window from my Bold, with a copy of
    the Regular in the template/mask/background. \r\n\r\nUsing visual comparison,
    the relationships between your Bold Italic and Italic should be similar to the
    relationships between your Bold and Regular. \r\n\r\nSo, for example, you might
    center a Regular 'o' behind the Bold 'o', and then you'll have a guide for how
    much weight to add to your Italic 'o' and how much you should add inside and how
    much outside. \r\n\r\nYou can keep shifting the relationship to check different
    aspects. For instance, I will usually position the 'n' centered on the counter
    and compare, then aligned on the right side of left stem and compare again.\r\n\r\nThis
    is how I use the Bold for visual reference. I believe it is essentially the same
    kind of thing that David is talking about.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"
