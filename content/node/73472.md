  body: "Since these letters are manufactured, there is no reason to assume that they
    are based on a font. For the purposes of manufacturing the letters, changes might
    have been made, even if an actual typeface was the initial model.\r\n\r\nIf a
    company made this sign, they may have their own custom alphabet they use for this
    sort of sign work.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any serif font/typeface that matched
    this, looking at over 1,900 families in the Serif Guide.\r\n\r\nMy guess is custom
    for this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You're right, Mike.  This typeface is called "Architectural" and is used by
    Gemini Plaques.  I don't know if it's commercially available.
