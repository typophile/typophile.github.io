  and the uppercase are just bold lowercase; not sure if it has any special characters
  or not.  Also, in the sample I've attached, the font was slightly stretched vertically
  and condensed horizontally.  Thanks in advance!\r\n"

  body: "@Curiousity\r\n\r\nYea Avenir is *very* close but not quite there.  In my
    example the tail on the 'e' curves the same but arc is shorter.  Also, the cross
    on the 't' is only on the right-hand side whereas in Avenir it's a full length
    cross.  Well this gives me a start.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have an idea?\r\n"

    are a number of, well, what one might call design errors that make it clear it
    isn't a professional-quality typeface.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "@minimalista\r\nThat is it, thank you very much!  I looked at dafont for
    a good couple hours and just must have missed it.\r\n\r\n@Thomas Phinney\r\nOh?
    Would you care to elaborate for me?  That's not a sarcastic question - I'm genuinely
    curious as I'm not a designer by trade but a software engineer.  I'm quite interested
    in design and typography and just trying to pick up as much as I can, so any more
    info would be great. Thanks.\r\n"

  body: "For one, look at the way the curved section connects to the straight section
    in the 'n' and 't' - it's very abrupt. Compare this to the sample set in Avenir
    which is optically corrected to look smooth.\r\n\r\nAlso, take a look at where
    the bowl of the 'd' connects to the stem. The thickness of the line should decrease
    in this area to accomodate the extra \"ink\".\r\n\r\nI'm sure a real font designer
    could elaborate on more \"mistakes\" but basically, the free font was constructed
    with perfect circles and lines with a uniform stroke width, and then wasn't adjusted
    at all. Avenir (even when squooshed) has been carefully designed to <strong>look</strong>
    like it's perfectly geometric with a uniform stroke width, even though it isn't.\r\n\r\n

  body: "Lex just pointed out exactly two of the biggest basic \"errors\" I was thinking
    of. The third would be the spacing is both poor and internally inconsistent. Probably
    there are other issues, but I didn't look very hard.  :/\r\n\r\n(edit) Having
    downloaded the font quickly, I now also observe that it has no overshoots for
    rounds, and the baseline is at 122 units in Y, instead of zero.\r\n\r\nOuch, that's
    seriously garbage. I feel sorry for anybody whose logo uses such a font.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    of those things before but comparing Mamma Gamma against Avenir I see exactly
    what you mean.  So, I'm looking at making some changes, heh.\r\n\r\nWould either
    of you mind if I shot you any questions regarding a font for my logo?\r\n"

  body: 'Somewhat similar to Avenir: <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008">Gotham</a>.
    There''s also three different narrow versions. Take a look at <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/graphik.shtml">Graphik</a>
    as well. You''ll have to contact Commercial Type directly for licensing (it''s
    not officially released, but I think they offer beta versions).'
