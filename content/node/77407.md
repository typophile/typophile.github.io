  a fontographer or any kind of design specialist, I'm a civilian, lol. But I love
  type, me thinks I must have been a printer in a former life.\r\n\r\nI have a question
  about Adobe Caslon Pro. Does anyone know why the line spacing is so wonky (1.5 or
  double spaced, not sure which)? There don't appear to be any characters in this
  font that need to have room made for them, so why by default is there this huge
  1.5 or double-spaced gap between lines by default in this font? This example is
  set at <strong>single spacing</strong>.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nLarry[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caslonexample_4014.jpg]"

    a single character that takes up a lot of space?

    program are you using to compose the lines you show?"

    Windows 7. Sorry for misunderstanding your earlier comment about it possibly being
    the program, Bojev. Multiple programs suggest it's the font, but I could be mistaken.
    I assumed it was a design detail, which is why I posted here. Just curious about
    this.\r\n\r\nI'm aware I can adjust the line spacing myself in the various programs.
    I'm just wondering why it's different by default than other fonts such as Times
    New Roman?"

  body: "A little detective work:\r\nIn this font, the Bounding Box goes 700 units
    below baseline, 1002 above. That's 702 units more than the 1000 unit em.\r\nThe
    height accommodates accents above capitals, and is fairly normal.\r\nThe depth
    accommodates some ornaments -- vertical border elements.\r\nThe lowest typographic
    elements (commaaccent) are maximum 277 below baseline.\r\nSo the ornaments in
    the font are responsible for its large line spacing."

  body: Here is Caslon Pro set at 14pt with 14pt leading and as you can see the ascenders
    and descenders will touch at this leading. Seems that with proper adjustment of
    leading you can solve the "problem"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaslonProSetting_4153.jpg]
