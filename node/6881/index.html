I know some of you have opinions about glaring typographic errors, etc., and I would love to hear them! Thanks for your help.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49918.jpg" alt="elite logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">i think this logo is pretty funny. i always have trouble liking logos where a picture is incorporated into the letters, because you have to try to see a picture and a letter, and you can&#39;t see them at the same time. <BR> <BR>the first E has a weird ending, and could be better... i would suggest having the line drawing separate from the type.  also, why isn&#39;t the other E attached? <BR> <BR>are the words &#34;Plastic Surgery&#34; going to be incorporated?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">looks a little op art to me.  like something you&#39;d see in the New Yorker a decade ago. <BR> <BR>However, the idea of the letters &#39;drawing&#39; the face is a good idea.  I just think here your E is getting wonky, try looking at the E without the face, as just a letter. <BR> <BR>perhaps the face is more idiographic/abstract.  the face profile could be circular and tie in better with the E.  your letters could be a geometric sans serif.  something contemporary and sleek.  I think this would be more fitting for a plastic surgery clinic named Elite. <BR> <BR>also, for another concept the E could be an eye.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The face seems as if it is being forced into the shape of the &#34;e&#34;. At first glance, I just kept staring at the face wondering what was going on there instead of reading &#34;elite&#34;. That might bring up some issues because if the name gets lost when people look at this, it will defeat the purpose of conveying the brand. <BR> <BR>The face looks like a football player from the 1920s, where a facemask wasn&#39;t a part of the helmet. Also, I thought of Amelia Eahart with the old pilot style cap which is confusing. <BR> <BR>I see what you&#39;re trying to do here by making the swash of the &#34;l&#34; cross the eye of the graphic. But it almost looks painful, almost poking into the eye which is probably not what the surgeon wants to convey.  <BR> <BR>Also, the face seems as if it is worried or concerned, as opposed to being happy and excited about surgery which might convey the wrong message.  <BR> <BR>Try to do some more research into the plastic surgery market in general, and ask the client some more specific questions to come up with more solutions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Unless the Plastic Surgery is about correcting an accident or birth defect, then its about self esteem. The illustration could use refinement but its a great start. What era was more self assorbed then pre-depression America. The Illustration alludes to what you might want to achieve, captured youth, beauty? I&#39;m not ready to say this isn&#39;t a way to go. Why look like every other Plastic Surgent. Dam the research</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again, everyone! <BR>The client specified that he wanted a female profile and I wanted to stray from any predictability. This was the only thing he was specific about.  Now, against any of Daniel&#39;s endearing support for Deco surgery, I must say that I&#39;ll re-open this logo when we get a fashion cosmetic client. Well, it was fun to work on while the moment lasted. Your comments are much appreciated!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">if the clients needs to have the profile, try looking at some profiles of women. try to determine which one represents the perfect profile.
