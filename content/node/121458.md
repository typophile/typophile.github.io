  if this has been posted in the wrong forum topic!\r\n\r\nI've recently created a
  logo design for a bespoke fashion brand using the typeface Lulo Clean One Bold (see:
  https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/lulo-clean/) and I'm trying to put together
  the rest of the brand identity. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm struggling to find a font that
  compliments Lulo Clean for body copy. The purpose I have in mind is for short body
  copy - i.e. descriptions of clothing online, perhaps sub headings / tag lines in
  italics? Ordinarily I'd try to match up fonts by using the x-height as an indicator
  of if the two fonts work together - but as Lulo Clean is an all caps font I don't
  think I can apply this rule (please correct me if I am wrong). \r\n\r\nHere are
  some of the key words for the project, to give a feel of the tone/mood required:
  modern-classic blend, sophisticated, luxurious, glamorous, high quality. I'm thinking
  of using Lulo Clean One for the sub headings / menu text, and thought that Source
  Sans Pro Regular or Open Sans Regular might work for the body copy (I'm trying to
  find a complimenting serif but none seem to convey the key words as well as these
  so far...).\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate any help/advice that the community here
  can offer. \r\n\r\nThank you!"

    you could try a text cut didone."

    are the same.

  body: "Thanks for your thoughts. \r\n\r\nI tried out Avenir and Gill Sans (unfortunately
    Gotham is still on my wish list), explored didone and geometric styles, but nothing
    seemed quite right, so I think I will need to go with a different font for the
    menu text/headlines which is similar enough to fit with the logo's use of Lulo
    Clean. \r\n\r\nAfter playing around for a while, I decided Proxima Nova was my
    best option. I've done a very crude layout just to provide a rough idea of how
    the text could be used and would love to hear your opinions on which combination
    works best.\r\n\r\nProxima Nova & Open Sans\r\nProxima Nova & Adobe Garamond Pro\r\nProxima
    Nova & Calluna\r\nProxima Nova & Merriweather\r\n\r\nEdit: Removed links as I
    have decided to go with varying Proxima Nova weights/styles."
