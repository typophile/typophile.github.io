<p>Sadly, that was the case with several revered type designers whose royalties from other foundries were meager to begin with. At CG, I worked with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tony Stan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (Stanziola) on the release of his last type family, Pasquale, named after his father.

<p>In some cases, typefaces from the metal years went through further transformations; photofilm, digital. And the licensing of these typefaces generated further income. Infringement could involve one in legal hassles.</p>
<p>Here is a hypothetical case: a very well known and long-lived typeface from a very well known firm is suspected of being based on someone else&rsquo;s drawings. Since this face had been licensed and cross-licensed over the years, if someone could make the claim that the very well known typeface itself was an infringement of this previous design that they had legal rights to, and won an entitlement, they could very well seek compensation based on all moneys made over the years.</p>
<p>Yes people do copy metal faces all the time, and sometimes they get a letter from a law firm. If rights had been established and there is a legal continuance of those rights, as in licensing, copying a metal face is as wrong, and potentially as dangerous, as copying a digital face.</p>

<p>Good point.
And I&rsquo;ll certainly be doing more research,
including contacting a grand-daughter, etc.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this particular design apparently never made it past metal. In fact the reason there&rsquo;s no digital version is probably due simply to the fact that there was never a photo version! These days people will much more rarely bother with reviving a metal face (especially one that&rsquo;s hard to find actually used extensively).
Because you need to physically find it, and then print it!</p>

<p>Here is what I was trying to get at with the words &ldquo;the right&rdquo;: In some contries, it is easier to patent the design of a typeface than it is in the US. If someone gets a 25 year design patent, and dies 20 years into it, I believe that the patent would pass on to his heirs for the remaining 5 years. In this time, you could not redigitize/release the said design without their consent.</p>

<p>Agreed, but without opening another can of worms, there have been those who claimed &ldquo;rights&rdquo; in the past who have denied revivals strictly based on &ldquo;type politics&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One of the only type families that I personally wanted to revive (strictly out of affection) is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hispalis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> originally from Fundición Tipográfica Nacional, with rights held by Neufville. A visit to Barcelona in the eighties got me nowhere (my primary objective was to license Schneidler).</p>
<p>Somehow it&rsquo;s still on Neufville Digital&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;to do&rdquo; digitizations, yet RoosterTypes has a somewhat sterilized revival version called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Schiller Antiqua<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Steve Jackaman.</p>
<p>What I loved about the metal design was the eccentric &ldquo;irregularities&rdquo; which are often the first things to go when standardizing for digital.</p>
<p>I know&hellip; sour grapes! :-\</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll report here with what I find, for

young. Wait, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Anyway.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if my offer came before or after some delving I did concerning a shall-not-be-named font I was (and still am) hoping to revive. If it was before, then what I can tell you is: ask Linotype - apparently they took ownership of most of the Nebiolo stuff. If it was after, that means I got lazy and didn&rsquo;t actually follow up (and can&rsquo;t right now, sorry).</p>
