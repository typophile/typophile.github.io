  is the choice of typeface. I wanted a typeface that felt like the illustration I
  drew...but somehow even though Futura is geometric it just doesn't quite work...but
  I am open to any and all criticism. \r\n\r\nHave at it! \r\n\r\nthanks!"

    the small details. I might not use the outline on the word bubble. The trees kind
    of look more like cacti. '

  body: Thanks Tiffany...good idea about getting rid of the outline on the word bubble
    (that does look better)...what do you think of the typeface? I also tried Century
    Schoolbook...but I am just not sure.

    you really want something cute(r) you might look into <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html">Coquette</a>.

    but not too cutesy. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone else with any thoughts on this?"
