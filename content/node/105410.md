body: "I\u2019m hoping someone can point me in the direction of some syntax examples
  for implementing language-specific ligatures.  I\u2019m not completely clueless,
  but I\u2019ve yet to find anything that\u2019s entirely clear to me either.\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  reason:</strong> I\u2019ve been looking at some [[http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html|free
  fonts]] which look promising, but they implement some ligatures that are only appropriate
  in French (ae -> \xE6, oe -> \u0153).  Seeing words like <em>d\u0153s</em> and <em>sh\u0153s</em>
  (or <em>G\xE6ilge</em>) is a little disconcerting.  I\u2019d like to corral these,
  though I suppose I could also just delete them.\r\n\r\nThe problem table seems to
  be this...\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfeature rlig { # Required Ligatures\r\n # Latin\r\n    sub
  A E by AE;\r\n    sub A e by AE;\r\n    sub O E by OE;\r\n    sub O e by OE;\r\n
  \   sub a e by ae;\r\n    sub o e by oe;\r\n script DFLT;\r\n    sub A E by AE;\r\n
  \   sub A e by AE;\r\n    sub O E by OE;\r\n    sub O e by OE;\r\n    sub a e by
  ae;\r\n    sub o e by oe;\r\n} rlig;\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBy looking at other fonts
  it seems that I would need to define languages somewhere by script, but it\u2019s
  not clear where you would do that (<em>ccmp</em> table?)."

    do not give rise to \u0153. It is the spell checker that replaces oe by \u0153
    in \u0153il, \u0153uf, b\u0153uf, etc. If you implement the ligature oe in the
    font, you will get \"c\u0153fficient\", \"m\u0153lle\" etc. which are plainly
    wrong."

    late yesterday ([[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html|Adobe:
    OpenType Feature File Specification]]).\r\n\r\nMy quick solution was to move this
    stuff to the end of <em>liga</em> in their own block...\r\n<pre>\r\n language
    FRA; # French\r\nlookup liga10 {\r\n    sub A E by AE;\r\n    sub A e by AE;\r\n

    was the usual thing to do for French, so removing it altogether is probably the
    best solution.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>May apply to some other scripts.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell
    it certainly seems to apply to text marked up as English and Irish in Webkit and
    on my Nook!\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Use the \"locl\" feature.\r\nThere have been a

    think <em>locl</em> is appropriate here, but it would certainly be easy to allow
    for Turkish while I\u2019m editing the <em>liga</em> feature.  These fonts already
    have fi & ffi in a separate block to fl, ffl & ff so it should be simply a matter
    of putting in something like...\r\n<pre>\r\n language TRK  exclude_dflt; # Turkish\r\nlookup
    liga1; # fl ffl ff\r\n</pre>\r\n...before...\r\n<pre>\r\n script dflt;\r\nlookup

  body: Just a note -- unless your font has all the characters needed for Turkish,
    it seems silly to exclude the f_i ligatures with a language tag. There were literally
    hundreds of fonts with that exclusion in {liga} that also lacked the dotted capital
    I. How would you set Turkish with such a font?

    use them for Turkish of course.  On the other hand, since these are fonts that
    can be freely modified I don\u2019t see how it causes any <em>problems</em> to
    nudge them in the general direction of Turkish compatibility.  In fact, if some
    other font was providing the missing fallback characters it could still make things
    a <em>little</em> less confusing.\r\n\r\nWhatever the practical implications,
    it has resulting in my learning a little syntax, so it was worthwhile for me!"

    the topic from <cite>books</cite> to <cite>type,</cite> in the <strong>for money</strong>
    fonts, say, oh, from Adobe, there aren't any combining diacriticals there, either.
    Show me an Adobe font that has all -- or even some -- of the characters from 0300
    to 036F. Less sure about the fonts from the Monotype conglomeration, but I'd bet
    it is similar. And include FontFont.\r\n\r\nI don't know about DTL. Wonderfully
    drawn fonts. I wish my customers (the 100 or so publishers in the Association
    of American University Presses) could afford them. I'm not being snide, I really
    would like to work with these fonts, as I think they would print (ink on paper)
    so much better than most of what is used. But I argue in vain, the annual font
    budget for most presses isn't large enough to buy even one DTL family. And designers
    have their quirks too, many would rather save up & buy the new display font of
    the year...\r\n\r\nTry offering an educational discount to, say, the University
    of Chicago Press. I'll broker the deal for free just to have the privilege of
    working with DTL fonts.\r\n\r\nGiven my customers can't afford DTL fonts my question
    is moot, but just out of curiosity, how many of them have populated the combining
    diacritics? How many languages can you cover? Romanized Arabic? Romanized Indic
    Scripts? The major (non-European) languages used in Africa? Native American languages,
    where \"American\" covers North, Central and South America?\r\n\r\nIt isn't just
    the little, unimportant people of those countries involved. Western Europe is
    full of ex-colonial powers, and as they run out of topics such as how many petticoats
    George Sand might have worn, had she worn petticoats, they turn to the history
    of those colonial days...\r\n\r\nActually, it is in the OpenSource fonts where
    attention is paid to combining diacriticals and support is given to the languages
    that require them.\r\n\r\nRemember, the Unicode Consortium said <cite>Gosh darn
    it golly gee whiz</cite> (or words to that effect), <cite>we're not going to keep
    assigning codepoints for accented Latin glyphs. The proper way to render such
    glyphs is to use a base character and a (or series of) combining diacritical(s).</cite>
    Which makes perfect sense. If you go read the section on combining diacritics
    in the Unicode Standard, everything is provided for. Now if only the font publishers
    would comply..."
