  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve recently been doing a lot more research and personal studies in type. I&rsquo;m thinking of doing an elaborate study on the perception of text, where I set a page in a certain typeface and analyze why the text is being perceived in a certain way. For example, in Maiola has a rather rich texture so if I were to analyze this typeface, it would be predominantly a study in which specific elements cause the texture to increase.</p>
<p>I would also be looking at why specific letters in a typeface are designed a certain way. J. Harris did experimental studies and found that serifs on the lowercase counters appear to reduce visibility, so in the typeface Spencer these elements are removed. Letters like h/m/n are missing the inner serif on the right side and features the suggestion of a serif on the left side and the /b features no spur. What are the benefits and what are the consequences of such decisions?</p>
<p>This would probably be an ongoing study until I feel I&rsquo;ve reached a point where the amount of analysis done results in meaningful insights. I could start with a random typeface but I thought it might be better to pick one typeface or perhaps one typeface from sans and serif to use as a standard which I can compare any other typeface I analyze to. I&rsquo;m aware there&rsquo;s no neutral or standard typeface but which typeface I select is in some ways arbitrary. What I&rsquo;m looking for is a typeface that doesn&rsquo;t do a lot of strange things, makes use of elements as we probably most expect it and has more or less standardized proportions. I think for the analysis it will be better if I select a typeface with a very consistent rhythm as well. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to select a humanist typeface because it takes too much time to explain the dimensions of a random typeface compared to the humanist typeface. Or quite possibly a humanist typeface is exactly what I need considering it&rsquo;s the first emerging style of typefaces and could therefor more or less be considered a standard. Frank E. Blokland makes an interesting case for the idea that the initial dimensions have been standardized during this period. On the other hand, the humanist model doesn&rsquo;t have the most even color so it probably fails my requirements in that regard.</p>
<p>So my question was going to be whether you can recommend one or a few typefaces that could be used as a standard in my studies, but the issue is a bit more complicated. So any help in considerations in how to go about this are very much appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I find the reply Delphic in its brevity.</p>
<p>Had the original post come from a new poster, rather than someone who is a long time poster here and a typographic professional, though, I would have tended to give this kind of advice:</p>
<p>Start with the basics. Overall texture might tend to be more uniform in two cases -</p>
<p>A typeface with a large x-height;</p>
<p>A typeface in a light weight - that is, one with thin strokes.</p>
<p>In both cases, the ascenders and descenders are less prominent, although in the second case, that isn&rsquo;t really true <!-- raw HTML omitted -->relative<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the part within the x-height, present for every letter.</p>
<p>Only after the simple and obvious is dealt with can one look at non-obvious impacts on overall texture by the characteristics of specific typefaces. Of course, there&rsquo;s lots of room for other things to have an effect; how heavy the serifs are; the way letters like &ldquo;e&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo; are shaped that are open in part within the x-height region, and so on.</p>
<p>But an approach that looks at one typeface at a time, and that subjectively, seems to risk getting lost.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, that&rsquo;s a rather disappointing answer. As far as I&rsquo;m aware Georgia was designed for clarity on computer monitors and not to provide the most even rhythm and both most generic and most consistent features. It might equate to the same in some regards, but I&rsquo;m also skeptical about Georgia still being my best choice after 20 years.</p>
<p>I must also say, perhaps it&rsquo;s just me but I didn&rsquo;t even consider Georgia for a moment because I sporadically try to set my essays in Georgia, thinking it provides clarity and comfort but I&rsquo;m always disappointed. I keep trying but I&rsquo;ve never used Georgia successfully. It just provides a very wrong texture which I find uncomfortable to read.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And this is another reason why Georgia is perhaps not the best choice or not the only choice. Like I said, there are many considerations to be made here. I have my own ideas on how to go about this but I would like some validation and other people&rsquo;s opinions. I will get more insight into the issue by simply doing experimental research but I thought I would first ask you guys as I like to start with theoretical research first.</p>

If you want to cover both print and screen, combo it with Miller, which I assume to be its print counterpart.</p>
<p>I recommended Georgia because it is transitional, i.e. not favoring old style or modern, and because of its huge distribution as a Microsoft Core TrueType font.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some experiments in extreme texture in the past but that&rsquo;s just one aspect of type. Right now I&rsquo;m doing a study into typography in a more general sense but I also look up the extremes in weight, texture and color. What I want to do now is start a study that is an extension on that one but looks in a more particular area, rather than looking into typography as a whole.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If that is the way to go, what sans would you recommend? Myriad has become a standard, but it might be too particular. Franklin Gothic is also too particular. Perhaps Akzidenz Grotesk?</p>
