  We are working on a project at our firm and need to find a typeface that resembles
  handwriting, but neat and nice handwriting. We are hoping for a more technical look
  and feel possibly nice handwriting of an engineer or draftsman. I have looked a
  few fonts that resemble drafting, but they are just a little too modular and contrived.
  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAlso one more thing, this font will
  be used sparingly throughout the report so we are hoping to not spend too much money
  or any at all on the font, if possible. "

    That Link should show you the charset available."

    (mostly +,-><?/\*()%&#%@ is what I need to have). I like the level of refinement
    here, but I am looking for something less calligraphic more like this: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Good-Foot,
    but if possible more refined and something that doesn''t look like it was written
    in such a hurry. I know I am being vague, but I am just having a really hard time
    finding something that is right, any suggestions are greatly appreciated. '

  body: "Another try: If you look for a rather neat hand printing font, maybe this
    one is the font for you: http://www.fontgrube.de/en/gapstown.htm\r\nIt comes in
    two versions (both regular and bold). The main difference is in the spacing. ISO
    8859-1 charset is pretty complete except for that currency symbol no-one really
    needs.\r\n\r\nAndreas"
