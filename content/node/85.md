  published a special seven-page supplement describing the tenth anniversary of the
  small island of San Serriffe. The island&#39;s geography appeared to be named after
  printing terms. For instance, its two islands were named Upper Caisse and Lower
  Caisse. Its leader was General Pica, and its capital was Bodoni. Articles described
  the eccentric culture of the island. One strange island custom was the Festival
  of the Well Made Play, during which islanders would perform the complete cycle of
  plays by playwright William Douglas-Home in English, Caslon, and Ki-flong &#40;languages
  of the island&#41;. Strangely enough, the islanders did not appear to understand
  the plays themselves. It was merely certain ritual aspects of the plays that they
  appreciated, as evidenced by the fact that they would &#34;applaud widely whenever
  an actor appears wearing a Harris tweed hacking jacket with a centre vent and cavalry
  twill trousers and a paisley cravat.&#34; Adding credibility to the supplement was
  the fact that many eminent people were quoted in it, referring to their experiences
  in San Serriffe. Authentic advertisements also accompanied the articles and played
  into the hoax. For instance, Texaco offered a contest for which the first prize
  was a two-week trip to Cocobanana Beach in San Serriffe. Kodak also ran an ad in
  which it said, &#34;If you have a picture of San Serriffe, we&#39;d like to see
  it.&#34; The Guardian reported that its phones rang all day as people called up
  requesting more information about the island. The success of this hoax was largely
  responsible for the flood of April Fool&#39;s Day jokes that appeared in other papers
  in succeeding years. At the Guardian itself the island of San Serriffe became a
  running gag in the years to follow. The island reappeared on April Fool&#39;s Day
  in 1978, 1980 and 1999. Moreover, each time it reappeared the island had changed
  location. It began in the Indian Ocean, moved to the South China Sea, and ended
  up in the North Atlantic.  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/af_1977.html"
