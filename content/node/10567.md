  <BR>I came across this the other day, with an old elevator still in use. Nowadays,
  all you get is the button. <BR> <BR>The awkwardness of the typography is charming
  -- the ridiculously narrow measure, and the different ways of justifying the text.
  What a lot of typography there is, caps, small caps and roman of Cheltenham, paragraph
  indents and leading, centred rules. The colon in the heading is quite unecessary,
  but elaboration is the name of the game. Beautifully written too, &#34;Press button
  firmly for a moment&#34;.

  body: Very amusing, thanks Nick. I guessed Cheltenham immediately, only because
    I used it so many times. Love the re-paint job around the brass panels.
