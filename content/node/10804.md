  body: My inspiration for this typeface originated when I was walking around the
    Nelson museum looking at early Mayan pottery. I found the hieroglyphics to be
    very interesting in their shape and use of line. I thought this would make a great
    font. I have chosen to work with the earlier style of Mayan hieroglyphics instead
    of the later style which is more decorative.  <BR>  <BR>I am still continuing
    to work on this font so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  <BR>  <BR>Thanks,

  body: That&#39;s kind of cool! A good start. My first thought is, maybe you need
    to have less differentiation between the cartouches &#40;sp?&#41; than you have
    now.

  body: I think you could have less diferentiation as well, but not tho the point
    where it loses its playfulness. <BR> <BR>i &#39;d like to see more glyphs out
    of their box that some have.
