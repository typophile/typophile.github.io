  in InDesign (CS3)?\r\n\r\nI have to copy text from a PDF document into InDesign,
  in order to be able to move around some text. The problem is, that I cannot get
  Adobe Thai Font to work properly (that is to show the proper Thai characters/signs).
  \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me?\r\n\r\nKind Regards \r\nAnne \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Where did you get an Adobe Thai font? How old is it?\r\n\r\nProper Thai fonts
    today, to operate correctly in Adobe InDesign CS/3 require to be encoded in Unicode.\r\n\r\nIf
    the font is encoded in Unicode, it should recognize all Thai characters correctly.\r\n\r\nVery
    old fonts, even in early PostScript or TrueType font formats, were not encoded
    in Unicode. As a result, they will not behave correctly.\r\n\r\n\"Smart\" OpenType
    fonts, if programmed intelligently, will not only treat Thai text encoded in Unicode
    correctly, but will also make \"intelligwnt\" contextual changes of certain Thai
    characters, such as switching one letter with a average character height, for
    another alternative character with a higher than average character height.\r\n\r\nI
    am unaware if any \"smart\" OpenType Thai fonts are available, but I know my friends
    at FontWorld (www.fontworld.com) are working on releasing a package early next
    year."

    do I find out whether the font is encoded in Unicode?

    Besides the encoding question, describe the problem of copying Thai text from
    the PDF.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that if Adobe sold it recently, it
    is encoded properly with Unicode, as Unicode has been supported by Adobe for many
    many years.\r\n\r\nThere is also the very likely possibility that the text that
    you copied from the PDF appeared as Thai, but was encoded in some wierd non-standard
    way from a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThe PDF format has been around for a long time.\r\n\r\nBefore
    text was encoded in Unicode, there were many non-standard ways of encoding text
    for Thai and other non-Latin languages.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, there are
    two options.\r\n\r\nA) If it's a small amount of text, then the text must be retyped
    using a font which was encoded in Unicode.\r\n\r\nB) If it's a large amount of
    text, such as page after page after page, then a simple text conversion program
    must be written or acquired, to convert the old text into the new Unicode text."

  body: "You're welcome.\r\n\r\nIt seems for sure that the data in the PDF and others
    like it were created either a long time ago, or with non-standard Thai fonts.\r\n\r\n(I
    know about this issue with Thai, as I have dealt with these issues in many languages
    over the past two decades. It's a real nightmere. Unicode aims to correct the
    problem for now and the future. The problem that you are facing is with the old
    data.)\r\n\r\nTo create a workable data conversion program, you need to know the
    old Thai encoding for each character, or to obtain a copy of the old Thai font
    which was used to create the files and the PDF. Can you gwet hold of either this
    information, or one of the old Thai fonts which were used? (Different Thai fonts
    may have been used by different people, creating the need for different conversion
    tables in the data conversion program.)\r\n\r\nThere was a program called \"Add/Strip\"
    on Apple Macintosh to create such a program. I am certain that there are similar
    programs on Windows. Contact FontWorld (www.fontworld.com, if you seek a custom
    solution - they have been doing this stuff for manty years)."

  body: "You can use Adobe Thai in InDesign CS3, with a couple of caveats, but it
    is important that you set the language of the text to [No language] for spellchecking
    etc. purposes. InDesign does not support Thai text beyond basic layout: no spellchecker,
    no hyphenation dictionary, etc. For some reason, the layout only works if the
    language is set to [No language].\r\n\r\nI'd say that about 99% of Thai layout
    works correctly in InDesign CS3. The thing that doesn't work is decomposition
    of the sara am vowel, which causes mark collisions when the preceding letter also
    takes a tone accent. There are manual ways to fix this, but these involve editing
    the text string, so are far from ideal."

    I made them. :)\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other OpenType Thai fonts available,
    including the classic Linotype Sukothai and Sirichana designs (the latter partly
    redesigned)."
