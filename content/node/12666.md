body: "Dear list members,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for london-based senior (at least 5 years
  experience) print and new media designers who are willing to participate in a review
  session regarding findings from my PhD subject: Developing a new framework for the
  application of screen-based typography. This review will be a chance for me to share
  my research, methods and findings with a practice-based audience and to discuss
  its relevance for practical use. Participants' insights and comments will influence
  the final development of the framework and subsequently be reported in the final
  thesis. \r\n\r\nThe review session will take place on the 8th of June, from 6.30-8.30pm
  at a central London venue. If you think you might be interested to participate in
  this review, please email me. I will send you a more detailed background information
  about my research subject and how the peer review session will be conducted. I would
  appreciate it if you could pass on this request to suitable designers outside of
  the list.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nJoyce"
