  body: Sean, I use CorelDRAW myself occasionally. I&#39;m not sure about the page
    numbers from the print dialogue--I think that&#39;s mainly for prepress. If you&#39;re
    wanting page numbers in your layout, I think you may have to add them manually.
    I would visit <a href="http://www.corel.com/support/">Corel support</a> and send
    an email. <BR> <BR>Here are <a href="http://www.cedesign.com/cefx/drawscripts.html">some
    scripts</a> that may be helpful. <BR> <BR>-Addison
