    heard this was the trip of horrors and he was a trooper! Thanks Maurice, for not

  body: Joanna-- <BR> <BR>You may have been the only person on the list of thank-yous
    to have seen my note! Can you send the text along to the three offices &#40;SF,
    Berlin, Benelux&#41; for me? You&#39;d know far sooner than I how to get it just
    to whom it should go. Thanks.
