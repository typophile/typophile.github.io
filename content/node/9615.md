  body: Zero, the idea of having a stable of faces precludes approaching each design
    project with a truly open-minded &#34;custom&#34; attitude, because you will be
    limiting your creative process into riding one of the fonts you already have.
    <BR> <BR>It would be better to acquire your fonts piecemeal, according to the
    unique demands of individual publications. That would be more like custom design.
    <BR> <BR>Better still, develop relationships with type designers, where you get
    &#34;beta&#34; copies of their latest models.  <BR> <BR>To max out the customization,
    don&#39;t use off-the-shelf typefaces at all, but commission a new typeface for
    a new magazine design.  <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>Bert, try the London
    Review of Books for major Quadraat implementation.
