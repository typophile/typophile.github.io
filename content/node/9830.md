body: This is my first post in these forums. Please be gentle. <BR> <BR>Forgive me,
  I use MS Word &#40;Windows&#41; to prepare laser-printed reports. I use Utopia in
  regular and semi-bold weights. I need roman and italic variants, including small
  caps. <BR> <BR>The standard Utopia fonts have lining figures which look gross when
  used in body text. So I switch to the small caps font &#40;which has old style figures&#41;
  to enter dates and numbers. Entering small caps also involves a font change. Constant
  font changes make writing more painful than it should be.  <BR> <BR>I see that Utopia
  is now available in OpenType versions which include the different figures &#40;lining,
  old-style, tabular&#41; and the small caps all in the one font. This would all be
  terrific if I was using inDesign as my writing tool &#40;no, please don&#39;t suggest
  that&#41;, but I fear that MS Word cannot properly select the right glyphs from
  an OpenType font to do small caps and old-style figures. <BR> <BR>Can someone please
  allay &#40;or confirm&#41; my fears?

  body: You are correct - you can&#39;t get at these OpenType features from Word.
    If the glyphs are mapped to the fonts PUA &#40;private use area in Unicode&#41;
    you may be able to insert them &#40;using insert symbol&#41; but that will mess
    up spell check, hyphenation etc., <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Simon <BR> <BR>Thanks for the clear answer.  <BR> <BR>I wonder when Microsoft
    will make Word capable of doing this? I don&#39;t expect you to answer, but it
    is a reasonable thing to ask for. After all, Microsoft is one of the OpenType
    proponents...

  body: 'The other option &#40;which I have found better, generally&#41; is to type
    everything &#34;straight&#34; and then use find and replace to make the changes
    when the document is complete. You search, say, for all figures in Utopia Regular
    and replace them with Utopia SC. You may then have to do a little manual adjustment,
    e.g. to all caps lines where you actually want lining figures, or conceivably
    even some other global change &#40;e.g., to make footnote references lining figures,
    if that is what you prefer&#41;. A similar approach can be taken to inserting
    ligatures and so on. <BR> <BR>A similar &#34;search and replace&#34; approach
    can be taken to inserting ligatures from an expert set: replace ffi and ffl first,
    then ff, fi, fl. I doubt that matters in Utopia, but in some fonts it makes a
    significant difference. <BR> <BR>You can fairly easily write or record macros
    which do these searches. The procedure then is to keep your &#34;master&#34; document
    clean. You get the text absolutely right. Then, when you want to print you run
    the macros and make any final formatting adjustments &#40;keeping those to a minimum&#41;
    and save the document under a new name. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a bit of a pain, but
    it does work. The result will not match InDesign or &#40;La&#41;TeX because kerning,
    spacing, and especially hyphenation are never up to snuff; but if your layout
    is sensible it can look much better than the typical Word document. <BR> <BR>Paul'

    that most users do not believe that it is possible because for some unknown reason
    MS decided to turn kerning off by default. The option is hidden in Font &#62;
    Character spacing &#62; Kerning for fonts bigger than XY. <BR> <BR>Hope it improves
    the result a little bit. <BR> <BR>Pavel'

    <BR> <BR>I wonder if you could change this in the normal.dot file so it becomes
    a default setting. <BR> <BR>...just tried it, seems to work. <BR>find the normal.dot
    file, open in in Word, change any settings you want to be on by default and then
    save the document. they should be applied to any new document you make after that.

    for this are... <BR> <BR>1. Word uses a different version of &#39;Uniscribe&#39;

  body: hmm, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to add a feature that switches ligs on? That
    way if you have an old document then it won&#39;t reflow or if you haven&#39;t
    upgraded your 386 to a Pentium you won&#39;t suffer.

  body: "As an aside, I know you said most of your text is ragged-right, but just
    in case you have any fully-justified: Remember that you can get much better than
    (Word's crappy..) default spacing in fully justified text by switching on Tools
    > Options > Compatibility > Do full justification like WordPerfect 6.x for Windows.
    (Which is also set on a doc-by-doc basis so would need switching on in Normal.dot
    and/or main templates.)\r\n\r\n...Word's justification just adds space until the
    words fit the line; this alternative method does attempt to tighten spaces instead
    where the result would be better. Dunno why that's not the default... :)\r\n\r\n\r\nEver
    since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."
