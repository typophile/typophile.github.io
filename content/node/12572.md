    like a turd in this otherwise wellwishing thread,  allow me to continue in English:

    is my fonty friend!</a> A trip to his summer home in Malm&ouml; was the perfect
    end to my stint in Sweden. He has a lovely family and a lovely foundry. He is
    quick to help and slow to anger. He laughs at my jokes and listens to my music.
    I love this man.\r\n\r\nHere's the best to you, Petah! Looking forward to hearing
    you and Stefan speak at TypeCon. (You've become quite the lecturer in your old
    age.)\r\n\r\nAnd now, <a href=\"http://stewf.com/stewftone/Happy%20Svensk%20Birthday.mp3\">a
