  by Imre Renner, convey a sense of power in restraint that perfectly suits this work
  by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The letters march in a pace that is measured
  but by no means static. The jacket is a gem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/breyerbkjacksm_5196.jpg]"

    concept about the writing style of Chip Kidd. I like the theme of the book. It's
    a classic choice for publishing a worthy book to make the readers conscious. I'll
    try to collect one copy of the book. Thanks.\r\nhttp://www.cochinechine.com/coats-and-jackets"

    that white space when you''re designing a portrait-shaped book jacket and the
    publisher hands you a landscape-shaped piece of artwork (that you''re forbidden

      of the colors are all calibrated to serve the tenor of the book.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    cover would look better with more wide open white space instead of having it chopped

  body: "Frank U. Finkelstein, I agree. The thin bits of the letter shapes begin to
    dissolve and the one point perspective formed by the top and bottom text blocks
    become too dominant. Somber grey tones with the 'busy' imagery make to the whole
    composition weary. All-in-all I doubt that Breyer is neither weary nor spaced
    out, lol.  \r\n\r\nAnd adding to that, his opinions are clearly worded.\r\n\r\nI
    think this Kidd's jacket is more about creating a one point perspective - as in
    - Breyer's one point perspective on democracy as a whole, and sacrificed the integral
    elements of the letter shapes to do so. Which is rather ironic.\r\n\r\nn. "

  body: A physical book is an object. Unless you are holding it in your hand, there
    isn't a lot that you can meaningfully say about its design. Looking at a low resolution
    thumbnail image of a book cover is no way to comment on its design, especially
    when it comes to factors directly affected by scale, spatial frequency and visual
    angle such as type spacing and stroke contrast.

    and sold on the internet, a thumbnail is all many buyers see before they order
    the book on-line or before they walk into the bookstore to buy or order the book
    there. That thumbnail version (smaller than the one at the top of this thread)
    is what sells (or doesn't sell) the book.\r\n\r\nThe thumbnail is the cover, and
    deserves its own review. You may not like that, but this is the way we live now."

  body: You buy books based on thumbnails of their covers? Isn't there a proverb about
    not judging a book by (a thumbnail of) its cover? I buy books based on reviews,
    recommendations or, at least, publisher descriptions of the contents. As far as
    I'm concerned, what a book looks like is irrelevant until I'm holding it in my
    hands. I think the notion of reviewing thumbnails of book covers is stupid. It
    is not 'how we live now', it is just a waste of time because there is nothing
    to be said about a thumbnail that tells you anything useful about the book.

  body: "That\u2019s not true.\r\nThe design of the cover gives the reader important
    cues as to what sort of a book is inside.\r\nWhen I was working for Harlequin,
    I discovered that there were many sub-genres of women\u2019s \uFB01ction, e.g.
    Historical, Humorous, Erotic, Chicklit, etc., and these each had a corresponding
    style of cover.\r\nWhether the author\u2019s name or the title is more prominent
    tells you how well known the author is.\r\nHow \u201Cclever\u201D the concept
    is counts too.\r\nWhen working for Jim Lorimer, he would set up prospective book
    covers on a pseudo-bookstore shelf, and see what they looked like from afar: not
    thumbnails per se, but a corresponding angle of vision. The book had to make a
    good \uFB01rst impression, across a crowded store, and get noticed enough for
    someone to pick it up and read the blurb, and perhaps open it and read the contents
    page or a few paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m surprised the brilliant Mr Kidd designed
    this dreary, unimaginative cover, though it is well-crafted and presumably on
    the money. (Perhaps he designed a really cool concept, but the client would have
    none of it?)"

    draw. For one thing it tends to be designed by somebody besides the person who
    did the actual book (which is sad) and often with zero input from the author.
    So I find it's better to [try to] ignore the cover.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Nick, I'm not debating that a cover can provide useful information, especially
    when part of a differentiated series from a publisher, as in the Harlequin example
    you give. What I am saying is that thumbnails of designs are not a worthwhile
    subject of <em>design critique,</em> especially not at the level of type stroke
    contrast as was happening in this discussion (the hairlines of the type in the
    image are greying out, whereas in the real object they would have the same stroke
    density as the main stems). I suppose one can make some general comments about
    concept and layout, but even there is is difficult to judge the real impact of
    the physical object from a small, low-res pixelated image.

    designs are generally quite dramatic, with clever concepts.\r\nThis Breyer book
    has a tombstone layout, and no concept!\r\n\u2014which is plain to see, even in
    a thumbnail. \r\n\r\nHowever, given the serious content of the book, perhaps it
    was decided that a \u201Ccreative\u201D cover was counterproductive. As Bob Gill
    put it when discussing such content, you shouldn\u2019t get creative if your text

    used with condensed fonts. Quark xPress was everybody's new toy, and they were
    letterspacing because Quark made it easy, not because it was the best design solution.
    At the time, I hated it. I thought making the type skinny and then putting wide
    spaces in it was like running the air conditioner with the windows open.\r\n\r\nI
    guess I've mellowed with the passing years. Now I look at a book jacket like this

    one is a bit unimaginative. It's not ugly, but it looks quite oldfashioned, or
    classical but not in a great way. It seems very conservative and serious, but
    perhaps thats just the thing for this book. But if someone told me its from the
    90s, I would not question it...
