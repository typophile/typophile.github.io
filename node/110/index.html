  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All. <BR> <BR>So here's my story: I've made a resolution of sorts with myself to stop design work early on fridays to start up a font ideas. So, this last friday I started in on a grotesque (purely for the name of course). Just making one little design decision after another I arrived at what follows. About 20 glyphs into it realized I'd just drawn helvetica. Lame. <BR> <BR>At that point obvious differences were the: a, k,  s and y. So I started working on variants some of which are included in the gif (really the only successful one is the two story g which is rough when you get up close). So I guess I'm looking for feedback of two kinds, 1) how could what I have be better drawn technically, and 2) any other ideas on how this could change. We need something like this about as badly as we need another humanist sans. I thought  about turning it into a slab serif? Thoughts? <BR> <BR>BTW, this is the first time I have ever made it all the way through a lower case so if only for that reason it was worth it :-) <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR>Randy <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10695.gif" alt="Neweue?"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, even though I think there are other genres more worthy of effort, to me a good, relatively readable Grotesque isn't nearly as cliche as a humanist sans. If you resist making it cloyingly grot (which however is somewhat fashionable now) and keep readability in mind, you might end up with a new workhorse. That binocular &quot;g&quot;, the &quot;k&quot;, and those angled stems for example make me think you're on the right track. What I might do differently is making it slightly narrower, and pulling in the descenders a bit. And keep an eye on Franklin Gothic, both for inspiration and to avoid coming too close to it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Excellent! Don't know why but this design makes me smile. <BR> <BR>Stuff I dig: <BR>- Double-story g. <BR>- Alternate j. (I'm not so brave) <BR>- Alternate i and j in text. Especially in the word little. <BR>- Slanted ends on the c, e, s. (Maybe make them parallel?) <BR>- The k (Star of the set) <BR> <BR>Stuff to notice: <BR>- I think the tail on the a works ok. Maybe it should be a bit <BR>bigger. It extends ok to the b and d, but it feels out of <BR>place up top on the p and q, and a little less weird on n <BR>and m. Hmm&hellip; what am I saying. Make the bigger every- <BR>where. Helvetica needs all the help it can get. <BR>- The arm of the a bulges near the end. I think the arm on <BR>that BCP needs to be slanted to the right a bit instead <BR>of pointing straight up. <BR>- The y really does look like it got stepped on. It looks ok <BR>in the text sample though, but I suspect it's because it <BR>sits next to the g. <BR>- Speaking of the g, neither version descends as far as the <BR>rest of the descenders. Here's a chance to open things up <BR>a bit more if that's your wish. <BR>- The outer curves of some characters, o, e, c, look a bit <BR>square. This makes the strokes at 45 degrees seem too <BR>thick. I like to call this the square marker effect since you <BR>get this sort of stroke modulation from drawing with a fat <BR>square sharpie) <BR>- The v, w, and x look like they're falling to the left and <BR>they're a bit dark. <BR> <BR>I dig this design on the whole. I called my second list stuff <BR>to notice because I have a natural inclination to turn any <BR>design into its closest relative, in this case helvetica, so <BR>ignore any advice that might have this effect. <BR> <BR>The beziers on the s look right on. The lower curve at the <BR>left end of the spine is a bit too square compared to the <BR>its sibling.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for the input. I dropped all the glyphs into fontographer to set some text. I hit auto space and auto bitmaps so it kinda stinks. Anyone have advise for strategies on this (perhaps a new thread). Particularly in getting decent bitmaps so you can make intelligent design decisions. I haven't the first clue about hinting.  <BR> <BR>I've made some changes based on your feedback: <BR> <BR>- Adjusted the tails. They are truely spurs now, but not high heels ( a turnoff in Franklin Gothic) <BR>- Adjusted the bulging &quot;a&quot; <BR>- Lightened and hopefully corrected the v, w, x <BR>- Narrowed the &quot;y.&quot; I wanted to avoid the standard tail, but hopefully it doesn't look to stomped anymore. <BR>- Re-drew the binocular g. The curves are much better now, but the bottom is light - grrrr. <BR> <BR>I haven't got a laser printer at the home office yet. Does it look ok printed? The 6 pt type was a little hopeful probably. <BR> <BR>Thoughts? <BR>Randy <BR><!--attachment: kortes_gothic-10721.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*31.0*kortes_gothic*kortes_gothic%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">kortes_gothic<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/kortes_gothic-10721.pdf" target="_blank"><b>kortes_gothic.pdf</b></a> (31.0 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>
