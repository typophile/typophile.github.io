  for multiple uses? (offset, thermal and flexographic print, computer and smartphone
  screen, etc)\r\nThe idea is to know what kind (if any) optimizations in design are
  made for preparing the font for a particular medium (specially for the new smartphones/web).\r\nThank
  you\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"

    find those studies about the development of typefaces for phone directories [[http://nicksherman.com/articles/bellCentennial.html|like
