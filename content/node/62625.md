  light bulb effect, doing that part in aftereffects, but just a similar script font
  with a nice thick stroke.\r\n\r\nExact not necessary, but the closer the better."

    Mistral (you need to do something about the M). \r\n\r\n@paulstonier: Silken has,
    btw, serious design and spacing problems with the germandbls (test: flei\xDFig),
    but that seems to be quite frequent with Scholtz' fonts.\r\n\r\nAndreas"
