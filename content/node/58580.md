  body: "I think if you are looking for \"free analogues\" the best place would be
    to look at the [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Sans Serif category]]
    at Dafont. That G in VEGEMITE is going to be a challenge, because that is probably
    a custom logo.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Dafont is always my first stop! I think I can edit the 'G' for the large 'VEGEMITE,'
    but what I'm really after (free or not) is the font used for 'FOR CHILDREN, TEENAGERS..'
    with the low feet on the 'R'.

  body: "Other than Neutraface, the only sans I can think of with the large counter
    on the R is Joe Treacy's Forever family. I can't seem to get his website to open
    (www.treacyfaces.com), but you could see them there. However, looking at hte sample
    in the old FontBook, the C seems more closed than your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just spotted this: \r\nGaraje 53 Unicase Black \u2013 http://www.256tm.com/en/special_offers.htm\r\n\r\nIt's
    not a super-close match (see the \"C\" or \"G\" for instance), but it shares the
    approximate proportions, and has the somewhat low waisted \"R\" that you're after.
    \r\nAnd it's also free."

  body: "Thanks for the heads up altaira! I think I might be able to cobble something
    together using Garaje.\r\n\r\nTreacy's site is blanking for me too, but I'll try
    it again in a couple days. Thanks for the insight in any case, Mike!"
