  I'm trying to transfer it into Indesign for aesthetic purposes. I'm not too concerned
  with re-setting the type however I have a number of references in the copy which
  are linked to footnotes. Is there any way of exporting those references to Indesign
  so that they are still linked to the relevant text?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
