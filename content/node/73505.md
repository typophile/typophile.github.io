  threads/posts with the glyph/character discussed would be very helpful. For this
  to work, you\u2019d have to be able to search the forum with one character only
  (now you need minimum three). Special characters should also be supported. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nA
  search for \u201C&\u201D should return all the threads/posts concerning ampersands.\r\nA
  search for \u201Cz\u201D should return all the threads/posts concerning z.\r\n\r\n"

    and flexible solution for now would be to keep the wiki up to date.\r\nExample:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12521\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14489"

  body: "Could work if there was a naming convention, quite often people refer to
    glyphs \u201C&\u201D, \u201Cz\u201D so i'd imagine something could be built to
    find those sort of strings.\r\n"

    it would pick up all those glyphs mentioned in the Critique section, for example.
    Which could be desiderable or not."
