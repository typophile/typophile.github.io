  body: "Your sample's really intrigued me. Shame it's not bigger, but hey-ho. I'm
    getting a sense of Century Oldstyle, particularly from the serifs on the Cap-T.
    However, the x-height and general balance seems to have more in common with a
    Garamond. I also can't tell whether the type in your sample is intentionally weathered;
    the \"i\" is either missing its dot, or it's so tiny that it doesn't register.
    I like the colour of ITC Founder's Caslon, which is weathered and seems to share
    a balance with yours, but the characters don't match.\r\n\r\nA couple of options
    that aren't it but ride somewhere in the vicinity are linked to below.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/century-old-style/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_founders_caslon_std_virtual/\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/janson-text/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/williams-caslon-text/\r\n\r\n-NJ"
