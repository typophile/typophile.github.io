  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m searching for information on historic characters sets, that means: which characters were present at a certain time at a printers office - e.g. Hans Lufft in Wittenberg for the bible prints in the 16th century.</p>
<p>Information in this special details (based on a printers available set) would be fine, 
but even a more generic table would help, e.g.
When did a versal (capital) U join the character set besides the capital V used for &ldquo;U&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I already did some research on this, but couldn&rsquo;t find any information online.</p>
<p>My interest results from a special case:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in the Schwabacher which Hans Lufft used for the german bible prints between 1534 and 1545. 
As far as I can see he hadn&rsquo;t a capital U (&ldquo;rounded&rdquo; form) but used everywhere capital V (as used at that time). On the other hand small u and v are present and used alternatively.
Looking on specimens I have available (e.g. Muzika, Die schöne Schrift) there isn&rsquo;t a capital U but &ldquo;&hellip; T V W &hellip;&rdquo;, but at the same time there seems to be U already in Fraktur.
In later specimens of Schwabacher U is present.</p>
<p>So there should be any information when certain glyphs were introduced into the character set of fonts.</p>
<p>I know an essay listing &ldquo;The supply of types in the sixteenth century&rdquo; by &ldquo;A. F. Johnson&rdquo;, but it does only list the fonts a printer had available and doesn&rsquo;t mention nor show the character sets.</p>
<p>Maybe someone can help me to find out more.
Thanks in advance for every hint.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Johnson, in <em>One Hundred Title Pages,</em> notes G.G. Trissino as being a proponent of Latin alphabet reform &ndash; introducing the U and J to disambiguate from V and I (and also proposing &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; omega to disambiguate long and short &ldquo;o&rdquo;).</p>
<p>However, his Wiki page doesn&rsquo;t mention this aspect of his career.</p>
<p>This page is from 1529, with the types of Lodovico Vicentino.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/trissino_4193.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It looks like, during the time that Trissino&rsquo;s reforms were making their way into general usage, printers would improvise, borrowing the &ldquo;new&rdquo; roman characters from Greek or Italic sorts. Or perhaps, as with a titling W, cobbling it together from a couple of Vs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, very interesting page. Thanks for the posting of this!</p>
<p>Apart from the fact, that they&rsquo;re different fonts in the titling line the omega really looks good, especially in the italic line (why didn&rsquo;t it succeed? maybe in these times as well as our times not always the best solutions are successful ;-) )</p>
<p>So Johnson seems to be am important person/researcher in these questions?</p>
