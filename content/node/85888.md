  body: "You won't get anything for free. Either you invest time to learn Wordpress
    Syntax (and HTML, CSS and some PHP if you don't know that yet), or you pay someone
    to do it. Either way, there's no such thing as a free lunch with this.\r\n\r\nThe
    proper way will depend a lot on what your site is and how clean your code needs
    to be. You can hack together a Wordpress-based site quite easily, but if every
    piece of text on the site needs to be controlled via the backend, you may need
    quite a bit of customization, depending on the original design. An experienced
    WP-Themer will be able to tell you more about this.\r\n\r\nAnd don't ask for pirated
    content on this forum, your requests will not be met warmly."
