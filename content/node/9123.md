body: Hey everyone. I was getting ready to design and flow a book and I am looking
  for everyone&#39;s favorite typeface to use for book interiors. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  used Bembo at 9/13.5 as well as Minion, Slimbach, and Serifa. <BR> <BR>Anyone have
  any favorites or any suggestions?

  body: Maybe the text could point you in a direction. What face would be right for
    the text?

  body: I for one don&#39;t have a single favorite font that can work optimally for
    all kinds of books. <BR> <BR>What is the book about? <BR>How long is it? <BR>Illustrations?
    What kind? In what proportion to the text? <BR>How important is readability versus
    economy here? <BR>At least. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: It&#39;s a book on Christian discipleship. I&#39;m more into readability over
    economy. Looks like it will be in the 200-225 pages range.

  body: Galliard, perhaps with Mantinia for titling. As Hrant and James have indicated,
    the project &#40;book&#41; itself should lead you. In addition to what Hrant has
    listed, consider also the market/audience.

    successfully uses it and I&#39;ve used it several times now in a book series.

  body: Dante seems to be popular with the Catholic press.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a very
    nice book face that was used for Crossing the Threshold of Hope, by Pope John
    Paul II.

  body: If you do opt for Galliard, I would highly recommend purchasing the Carter
    &amp; Cone version with small caps, oldstyle figures, fractions, alternates, etc.
    -- essential in my opinion for first-rate book typography. <BR> <BR>Available
    from FontShop for $149.... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&amp;displayfontid=CA.6675.0.0"

  body: For a religious book, but not a sacred text, and for an American audience,
    I would consider some of Goudy&#39;s faces, such as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-berkeley-old-style/"
    target="_blank">Berkeley</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/goudy/"
    target="_blank">Goudy</a> Old Style. These bring a warmth and personal touch you
    may want, depending on the nature of the text. If you decide on Goudy Old Style,
    I think P22 will probably soon reissue Lanston&#39;s version with the full descenders,
    which will probably be nicer.

  body: I was going to recommend Goudy for religious texts as well! I think it comes
    from the family bible being printed in Goudy, it&#39;s an automatic association
    for me. <BR>And how did you know that &#34;P22 will probably soon reissue Lanston&#39;s
    version with the full descenders&#34;? have you been peering over my shoulders?
    ;^&#41; It should come out with the next issue of Lanston fonts in April, I believe.
