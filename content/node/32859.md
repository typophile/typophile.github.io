    Vista - there are far fewer joining forms than Latin or Cyrillic in the font but
    there are some.

  body: "Gerry Leonidas has been collecting examples of Greek handwriting from different
    periods (mainly modern examples, i.e. since renaissance and earlier periods are
    well covered by palaeography studies). From what I have seen of recent Greek handwriting,
    most of it is disconnected, but there are some interesting shape distinctions
    from typical typographic forms, most notably the lowercase sigma, which when written
    quickly has a shape similar to a loosely formed Latin G.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's new
    Segoe Script font seems to do a pretty good job of imitating modern Greek handwriting.\r\n\r\nGerry
    has some lovely examples of fine penmanship from earlier in the 20th century."

  body: "It is not possible to map Latin hand models to Greek ones in anything approaching
    a one-to-one relationship. It <em>is</em> possible to see how specific tools lead
    to corresponding ranges of shapes, but there has been little effort to deal with
    the question \"what forms does this tool give rise to?\" There have been sporadic
    entries for Greek in the \"manuals\" of writing masters, which are really there
    to tick the box (\"Look Ma, I can do Greek!\") but range from the uninformed to
    the clumsy. An exception is Porson's manual devoted to Greek (see an excerpt below)
    but it tries to find consistency is some movements where none exists.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1835_PorsonYoung7w_6327.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore
    importantly, in addition to the absence of writing manuals generated by an elite
    (what you could call top-down models) there is a corresponding absence of models
    for teaching schoolchildren, and by extension adult learners of the script (bottom-up
    models for wider consumption). This continues through the nineteenth and twentieth
    century, despite the weight attached to language as an instrument of nation-building.
    To this day no Greek Ministry of Education or related authority conducted any
    serious research into the matter, and primary school teachers are left to their
    own devices. The official books for the early school years differ considerably
    in their approach (some have script models for copying, some use Helvetica --
    I might add: a fantastically uninformed choice that betrays not only cluelessness
    in matters or writing system acquisition, but also the history of typeface design).
    Parents and adult learners are left to consume mostly flimsy booklets produced
    by the numbers, often translated from British editions. \r\n\r\nThere is only
    one serious study of the matter, a 1935 work by a Cretan educator, M. Amariotou,
    but it is as rare as it is important: I have only had sight of one copy (in Klimis
    Mastoridis' library) and know of no other copy in existence. \r\n\r\nSo, after
    this long diversion, the answer to Paul's question is: different script, different
    models. The script does not lend itself to joining as much as the Latin does,
    but most native writers join the letters in very imaginative (and often illegible)
    ways that you wouldn't expect, because people tend to develop highly personal
    hands.  \r\n\r\nOf script typefaces out there, Segoe Script is probably the best
    model for a contemporary informal Greek hand you can find. Jim and Carl did a
    great job of a difficult brief. \r\n\r\nAnd, just to throw you off the scent,
    here's an excerpt from a letter (2000, educated male): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/2000xM1w_3811.jpg]"

    letters, it's closer to block printing. \r\n\r\nA formal style based on the Bergling
    model would be quite appropriate if it were kept tight and \"professional\" --
    in the same way that 18th century Roman scripts still have typographic currency.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    for the typographer there is the matter of historical allusion, of mixing types
    from the same era and style to provide an innate harmony. So the question would
    be, which serifed or sans fonts have the classical gas to run alongside a Berglingesque
    script? One of the GFS Bodonis, for starters. As with Snell, the capitals would
    make great initials, so I'd say go for it Paul. The interesting part will be using
    OT to deploy the alternates, such as the tall tau, which goes in the middle of
    words only, AFAIK, and tall zeta at the beginning? "

    examples posted here, I haven't seen any examples of formal, connecting scripts
    for Greek (the elegant kind you associate with copperplate, wedding invitations,
    etc.) either as typefaces or handlettering. Reading through this thread makes
    me wonder if there is much to be found. It's interesting that Greek forms seem
    more flowing and fluent than the Latin and Cyrillic counterparts, yet it's the
    latter two scripts that have a strong tradition of formalized connecting script
    forms.\r\n\r\nWhen I was learning to write Greek the one manual I saw was based
    on upright letterforms, so this was a question I had, too. Have there ever been
    script models for teaching based on connecting scripts? You know, like for learning
    'cursive' for Latin and Cyrillic?\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know where I can see
    samples of the Segoe Script Greek? Don't have Vista yet.."

    worth remembering that the dominant Greek writing styles that emerged in the Byzantine
    empire and which persisted for several hundred years were a mix of connecting
    and unconnecting forms. The early formal book hand is entirely unconnected, but
    around the end of the first millennium AD a connected uncial form developed. The
    letters are still very upright and formal, but there are a lot of x-height and
    baseline connections and some exciting x-height cross-strokes that connect more
    than two letters. In Barbour's <em>Greek Literary Hands,</em> almost all the manuscripts
    between 850 and 1400 are variants on this style. During this period, some writing
    speeds up, with the usual results of horizontal compression, slant and abbreviation,
    laying the groundwork for the style that Aldus adopted in print, and which became
    to dominant writing hand in the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, almost no Greek
    palaeography texts cover anything after 1600. Still, that's 800 or so years of
    resolutely connected Greek script."
