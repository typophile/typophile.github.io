<div class=commentbody>I'm still somewhat unsure if it's suposed to be a "script" font or not, hence the name. <br> <br>My plan is to use it for section titles on my website. I didn't spend too much time on kerning, because I felt that it would be easier to kern it by hand when applying it. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/580.gif alt=vacillation2.gif> <br> <br>-Jonathan</div>

<div class=commentbody> My impression is that you're going to need a good number of alternates to make this work as a script - but it's a great idea! <br> <br>BTW: <br>1. I think your lc "s" can be confused for an "8" in some contexts. <br>2. The lc "g" is descending an extra pixel. <br>3. You might try making the lc "f" descend. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Jonathan, <br> <br>I echo Hrant's comments. Looks like the 'f' does <br>descend, but try another pixel. I really enjoy <br>the tapering terminals (f, p, K, R). It gives <br>the thing a nice blackletter feel without <br>sacrificing legibility. Very nice start. <br> <br>One more idea: drop the script tails on the <br>numerals. I'm not sure they need to be a part <br>of a connected line. <br> <br>Stephen </div>

<div class=commentbody> I would agree with everything that's been posted so far. <br> <br>On the lc "s", why not experiment with even more of a cursive form, dropping the upper loop altogether and widening the lower one? <br> <br>Regarding that lc "g", I like the look of the elongated lower loop, but it does stand out from the other glyphs. I think Hrant's suggestion to vertically condense the lower loop by a pixel is a good one. <br> <br>The only other suggestion I have is to check the "M" and "N", as well as the "U", "V" and "W". When set together, these characters seem to be running in to each other a bit, causing some legibility problems. Perhaps adjusting the script connectors somehow would help, or maybe a pixel of kerning added to these letter combinations.... <br> <br>It strikes me that these forms would make an interesting vector-based font as well. Nice work. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Fun. It reminds me of Matthew Bardram's <br>Scriptometer (with a larger cap height?). <br> <br>I was skeptical of Scriptometer at first but <br>actually grew quite fond of it. (In the <br><a href=http://typophile.com/articles/bardram target=_top>Bardram interview</a> here.) <br> <br>As to Hrant's suggestion for alternates-- <br>although it might add some depth to the face, <br>I'm not convinced it's necessary. <br> <br>I agree with Stephen about the numerals. <br> <br>//joe</div>

<div class=commentbody> Thanks for everyone's suggestions! You've been very helpful. <br> <br>I especially like the idea of giving the lc "s" its cursive form. <br> <br>I'll try and work on it some tonight, and post the results tomorrow. <br> <br>-Jonathan </div>

<div class=commentbody> Even though it now fits in the vertical bounds, the new "g" is still the most prominent character, thanks to its bulky descender (which I think is nice). <br> <br>BTW, your scheme of separating the connectors is pretty cool. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Getting nicer, indeed. <br> <br>The new lc "g" (as well as lc "f" and "j") is really nice. <br> <br>The uc "M" and "N" are much improved, but the uc "U", "V" and "W" (with the connectors activated, anyway) still read like one long piece of hard ribbon candy. (Mmmmm, hard ribbon candy....!) I guess it's sort of the point of the connectors, and I must admit, the connectors most probably wouldn't be used with this combination in the caps all that often, but it still might warrant one more look. <br> <br>And if that's the only criticism I can come up with on second draft, I'd say you're on to something here. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> Very nice. <br> <br>David </div>

<div class=commentbody> Thanks, Hrant, David - I really appreciate you taking the time to give me pointers and encouragement. I'm relatively new to font making, so it's good to hear feedback from people who already know what they're doing. <br> <br>As for the "U","V" and "W" I've tried several different ways of connecting them, but can't seem to avoid the appearance of them all running together. (Yes, Mmmmmmm, ribbon candy!) However, I agree that it is unlikely that this issue will come up very often in "real life". <br> <br>In response to something you said in your first post - I originally created Vacillation as a vector based font (.ttf for PC), so if you'd like a copy of it I'd be more than happy to email it to you.
