  body: hi tom. <BR> <BR>There are tons of Dover books with typographic ornaments,
    scrolls <BR>and flourishes ... try bookfinder.com with a  <BR>keyword of &#39;ornament&#39;  or
    &#39;flourish&#34; <BR>or try the design/clip art section at a major bookstore.
    <BR> <BR>btw, that&#39;s the work of Hydro 74 ... he started working for Relevant
    a few months ago. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.hydro74.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hydro74.com/</a>

  body: those examples in your second post have some nice ornaments indeed.  I wouldn&#39;t
    mind knowing the font on girlspink_shirt_zoom.jpg myself, although it&#39;s probably
    a hydro74 custom aswell right?

  body: There are a couple of things I see on ProDTP that I like and that are downloadable,
    but how do you contact them?  I don&#39;t speak or read Russian and wouldn&#39;t
    want to put something on a commercial site that would cause me problems. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Sharon
