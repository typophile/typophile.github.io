body: "Three of my favorite movements of art history are the Bauhaus movement, the
  Constructivist movement, and the Futurism movement.  Clearly, Bauhaus, Futurism
  and Constructivism are related insomuch as Constructivism was the Russian lovechild
  of Bauhaus and Futurism.  And so it goes:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhaus_5755.jpg]\r\nBauhaus
  is the big granddaddy of 20th century design.  Strong geometric shapes and lines
  characterize this style.  Streamline was key not only in Bauhaus architecture, but
  as is apparent from the picture, in design.  Sans serif fonts became more prevelant
  thanks to Bauhaus, and the modern age was born.  Oh, the celebration of man!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1038935991futurism_5897.jpg]\r\nFuturism
  began in Italy in the early 1900s and lasted until the end of WWI.  Futurists took
  the Bauhaus' teachings and made them political.  Relating natural and man-made forms
  to the laudability of war and fascism, Futurism was used as a rallying mechanism
  for the Italian people.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Malevich%20-%20Suprematism_5072.jpg]\r\nIronically
  enough, the Bauhaus also came to inspire Constructivism, which typified Communism.
  \ Isn't it great how one school of thought can appease an entire spectrum of political
  belief?  The strong primary colors, abstraction, and gemometric shapes in Constructivism
  were used as tools rather than pretty aesthetics.  How can such things be tools,
  you ask?  The designs were strong to represent the strength of the Russian government
  and workforce to reassure the people of the validity of Communism."
