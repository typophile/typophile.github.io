body: I've been a PC user for many year but have finally gotten frustrated enough
  to want to switch to a Mac. My problem is i have a couple thousand fonts on my computer.
  Most of them are adobe fonts with some true type in the mix.  So what i want to
  know is there way to transfer my font collection to a Mac or am i screwed and have
  to get all new fonts?

  body: If you get a Mac, you will need font management software to supplement the
    built-in Font Book...FontAgentPro is the best. FontAgentPro supports all major
    type formats, including PC TrueType, for use in your new Mac. So there should
    be no problem importing your PC fonts. Whether they will look as good as your
    new Mac PS fonts is another question. Also, get FontDoctor...it's the finest,
    most rigorous diagnostic test-and-repair software for checking and fixing your
    fonts, whatever their format.

  body: "The problem lies in PC-PostScript-fonts. These can\u2019t be used on a Mac
    straightaway. You need to convert them with a tool like TransType.\r\n\r\nIf your
    collection contains PS-fonts you bought, you could enquire at the vendors whether
    they\u2019d be willing to crossgrade those (for a small fee, hopefully).\r\n\r\nBTW
    Using FontAgentPro to manage fonts is a good idea. There's also FontExplorerX,
    which is free and a viable solution too. (Don\u2019t go the Extensis way \u2014
    Suitcase has been a buggy product forever.)\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Warning: I found that FontAgentPro and FontExplorer have bad software conflicts
    in Mac OSX, so it's better not to put them together. FontBook, already installed
    in your Mac system, will display font sample alphabets adequately, though no better
    than that, but at least it operates seamlessly with FontAgentPro (which also displays
    sample alphabets, but not ideally).\r\n\r\nNot sure about support for PC Postscript...the
    FontAgentPro help section says they support all type one postscript, which would
    seem to include that. I'm sure I have some PC Postscript faces in there, supported
    now, but I can't swear to it. So make some inquiries, or do the conversion Bert
    suggests.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you get some Storm Foundry type families, you
    will have to install them in Fontbook rather than in FontAgentPro. Storm is the
    only foundry I know with that problem: only via FontBook do you get all fonts
    represented and linked properly. On the plus side, their text families are nicely
    priced and all fonts in the family are keystroke-linked, which is rare among boutique
    foundries. Regent II, Tusar, Jannon, and the best Walbaum on the market: each
    bundle is less than $80, instantly downloadable from myfonts."
