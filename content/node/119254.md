  tell me how do they format the quoted titles from other newspapers?\r\n\r\nFor example,
  in this article about Novak \u0110okovi\u0107, take a look at how the formatted
  the headlines from <i>Observer</i> and <i>Independent on Sunday</i>?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/02/the-third-man-8\r\n\r\nCould
  you also take a look at the formating of A.M. and P.M.? They should both be in small
  caps, but the A in A.M. looks a bit bigger."

  body: "In the article to which you linked, I presume that \"We're too sexy for our
    shirts\" is the headline from another publication to which you referred.\r\n\r\nIn
    my browser, it looked like it was in normal Roman upper and lower case, but in
    a smaller point size than the rest of the text.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if the print
    edition of The New Yorker does things that way, and I rather hope that it doesn't."

    known as one of the most fastidious publications when it comes to grammar, style,
    and typography, for example, typesetting any abbreviations with less than 4 letters
    in normal capital letters and those with 4 or more in small caps."

  body: "Used to subscribe. I guess I am a semi-regular reader. The old issues I have
    available ATM  (2008\u20132011) set blockquotes smaller with tighter leading,
    and they set long acronyms a point or two smaller. Enough to make it look noticeably
    lighter than surrounding text. Although I would love to see the New Yorker use
    proper small caps, Caslon\u2019s are way to small for acronyms. In that sence,
    dropping the font size is a less jarring solution. If they are as perfectionist
    as they say, the limit is six letters: UNICEF is faux SC, MSNBC is all cap. Newspaper
    headlines sit between double curly quotes, but in the same style and weight as
    the surrounding text. I don\u2019t know if they changed this in the new redesign.
    The designer of their new text typeface, Williams Caslon (used to be Adobe Caslon,
    I believe) is a regular here. His name is William Berkson. He might know more.
    \r\n\r\nEdit: Five letter acronym PIIGS also faux SC, NYPD caps. Not so consistent.\r\n\r\n"

    to me, and, at the same time, there is too much white space around it. I much
    more liked the old look with the Times New Roman. Fortunately, the Adobe TypeKit
    can be turned off.\r\n\r\nSo, the limit is six letters? Who says that?\r\n\r\nWiki
    also says 4:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps"

    Caslon Pro) as the text, just 4 points smaller (the text is 20 px, the quoted
    head 16 px). \r\n\r\nSame goes for the A.M. and P.M. (the A appearing larger than
    the M is only an optical illusion), which is set in 16 px.\r\n\r\nI was always
    taught to set acronyms in smaller sizes than the surrounding copy (not in small
    caps, just a point or two smaller), but I've never seen anyone set a quoted headline
    smaller than the surrounding text. It may just have been a tagging error."

  body: My Williams Caslon Small is used only in the Goings on about Town listings
    in print. The rest of the print version is now still in Adobe Caslon. I believe
    they use they only use Adobe Caslon on line; on screen they have more space to
    use it at similar, larger size in their listings.

  body: "In reality, JamesM and kthomps5, I wasn't asking about that.\r\n\r\nI was
    asking is there a typographic rule which says that you need to typeset newspaper
    headlines in lower text size.\r\n\r\nThen I added the question about the number
    of letters in an abbreviation for it to be typeset in small caps.\r\n\r\nI have
    no idea how kthomps5 thought I asked a question about Caslon, which I wasn't.\r\n\r\nI
    have no idea why JamesM felt the need to point something out, to be helpful, but
    then ended up being very unhelpful and snarky. Why haven't you, James, posted
    a link? Why didn't you do a search? You knew what thread it was, it was much easier
    for you to do it than for me to divine which one you meant."

  body: "Sylph, please reread my first post. \r\n\r\nI was merely pointing out that
    the quoted headline was in the same typeface as the surrounding text (and identified
    the typeface), but in a smaller point size. I also pointed out that the smaller
    size was most likely an error, which Michel Boyer confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe whole
    Caslon discussion was initiated by someone else, and the additional link I posted
    was a response to JamesM, not to you.\r\n\r\nIf you want a good guide to typography,
    Robert Bringhurst's \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" is your best resource,
    and it covers both the abbreviation/acronym question and the book/journal/article
    title typesetting question. You can find it at Amazon and Barnes & Noble.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you make the investment in the book, for I wouldn't expect many answers
    to any of your future posts on this forum....\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    so it had <em>some</em> relation to your question. Although I have to admit that
    if one Googles about how this kind of quoted material is handled typographically,
    what you will normally see is <em>italics</em> if not just quote marks... this
    is really the first time ever I have heard of anyone using a smaller type size
    for in-line quotations.\r\n\r\nQuotes of whole paragraphs are a different matter
    - they may well be in a smaller point size in addition to being indented at both
    margins."

    and someone might refer the poster there politely, but IMO it's undesirable to
    be too persnickety in this regard, as in this case, where the subject was not
    really the same, or simply when circumstances have changed a great deal since
    the last occasion and you not want to wade through a whole historical discussion,
    except of course where Chuck Norris comes into it.
