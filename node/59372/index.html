<strong>
Banner Competition
<p>Whilst preparing for the launch of the Taskforce and this website we were looking at a mock up of the site. It looked a little bare. We needed a banner. We thought, who better to supply the banner than you? So rather than send the job off to the department’s designer we thought we’d hold a competition to design a banner for our site, and a logo for the Taskforce.</p>
<p>The prize? Well like a lot of things on Web 2.0, there’s no money involved, just your pride in your work and the opportunity to have that pride vindicated and acknowledged publicly – in short a platform to show the world how good you are! And a platform to express graphically the potential of Government 2.0.</p>
<p>So get to it.</p>
</strong>
<p>The address is <a href="http://gov2.net.au/banner-competition/">http://gov2.net.au/banner-competition/</a></p>
<p>If your keen better get in quick, I&rsquo;m sure there are going to be plenty of quality designers chasing that sweet reward.</p>
<p>Pride&hellip;.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say my post was stupid.
I was pointing out that professionalism is not, as you infer with the term &ldquo;so called&rdquo;, an opinion designers may have of themselves, but may also be by constituted by membership in an organization that is recognized and respected by non-designers, and, in the case of the RGD, defined by government as a profession, in a similar manner to the traditional professions.</p>

<p>p.s.  the word you were looking for is &ldquo;imply&rdquo;,
and not &ldquo;infer&rdquo;&hellip;  &ldquo;infer&rdquo; was what <em>you</em> did&hellip;
but considering that &ldquo;infer&rdquo; is what you did,
and &ldquo;imply&rdquo; is <em>not</em> what i did, there is some
strange correctness that you chose that term.
to me, if you get paid, you are a professional.

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.
As far as one&rsquo;s practice goes, one might choose to raise one&rsquo;s prices, sniff, and walk on.
But there are duties involved in being a professional, one of which is advocacy.
I recall attending a talk by FHK Henrion many years ago, where he stated the duties&ndash;first to conduct one&rsquo;s business properly, but also to organize, promote, and educate.
We have to continually get the message out as to what is appropriate behavior, because the culture of graphic arts has been so disrupted by digitization that there are many without a formal education who, according to your basic definition of professional as getting paid for work, are professional designers, but have no idea what is ethical or not.
Sure, it&rsquo;s a power play by the establishment, but it also represents the cultural equity of evolved values, a remedy to the race-to-the-bottom free-for-all which does nobody any good in the long run.</p>

<p>if you <em>really</em> want to get involved in &ldquo;education&rdquo;, though,
i&rsquo;d suggest you start at the top, with google.  they&rsquo;re doing
a program where they invited artists to design their page&hellip;
for no pay.  and a number of artists said &ldquo;no pay?  no way!&rdquo;
which i salute.  google just shrugged, because other artists
thought that the &ldquo;exposure&rdquo; would be well worth it, to them.
which i salute&hellip;  so google, one of the richest corporations
in the world right now, got their art for free.  i salute that&hellip;

<p>no budget for a banner, nope.

If you don&rsquo;t have a budget for a banner then don&rsquo;t have a banner.</p>
<strong>

<p>yeah, but he refuses to do spec work,
so he won’t be entering the competition.
</strong>
First, not all designers are men.</p>
<p>Second, the point of having a departmental designer is so that when you need design work done, someone with intimate knowledge of your business is on hand to do it—eliminating the need to hold a &lsquo;competition&rsquo; like this.</p>
<p>Finally, the departmental designer wouldn&rsquo;t refuse to enter the competition because the departmental designer would be getting paid for their time—winning entry or not. Not spec work. Just work.</p>
<strong>
> Not to mention that its a government operation.
<p>well, that explains why they have no budget for a banner.
</strong></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a budget for a banner (or logo—which is really what this competition is asking for) then don&rsquo;t have a banner (or logo).</p>

<p>the more you continue, the more i laugh!</p>
<p>the fact of the matter is that there are
all kinds of entities out there who are
getting people to <em>give</em> work to them.</p>
<p>does it suck that people are willing to
do <em>your</em> job for absolutely nothing?
well, it sucks for <em>you</em>, that&rsquo;s for sure.

<p>and why should this entity &ldquo;go without&rdquo; something

<p>look, this is all funny enough to me, even without
you giving me even <em>more</em> reason to laugh at you!</p>
<p>besides, your bias here might be very shortsighted.
perhaps this entity is simply trying to <em>engage</em> their
target audience by involving them in a little &ldquo;game&rdquo;.
maybe they&rsquo;re attempting to whip up some interest.
my word, could anything be any more boring than
&ldquo;government 2.0&rdquo;?  the thought of it makes me puke.
but remember, i&rsquo;m not defending these cats at all&hellip;
i am <em>laughing</em> at them.  and i&rsquo;m not defending the
people who submit work to this little &ldquo;competition&rdquo;.
i&rsquo;m <em>laughing</em> at them.  oh, and i&rsquo;m laughing at you.
and the more you persist, the funnier the joke gets&hellip;</p>

<p>speaking of competitions, though, it is perhaps ironic that
today, &ldquo;the netflix prize&rdquo; has finally gotten a qualified entry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/leaderboard">http://www.netflixprize.com/leaderboard</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with this particular challenge,
but some 3 years back, netflix offered a million-dollar prize
for significant improvement on their recommendation engine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/winning-teams-join-to-qualify-for-1-million-netflix-prize/">http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/winning-teams-join-to-qualify-for-1-million-netflix-prize/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>teams of statisticians have been on the attack ever since.
one team &ndash; a merger of two previously-existing teams,
both of <em>them</em> the result of prior mergers &ndash; has finally
reached the threshold, triggering a &ldquo;last call&rdquo; for all teams
to try to match or beat the leader.  if no team can do that,
and the leader&rsquo;s results stand up against all netflix data,
the million-dollar prize will be awarded&hellip;</p>
<p>considering that netflix has like 10 million subscribers,
the per-subscriber cost of this prize was 10 cents each.
since good recommendations result in happy subscribers,
and better retention of their monthly fee, that&rsquo;s a good deal.</p>
<p>the nice part is that netflix only gets a nonexclusive license,
so the inventors of the methodology can license it to others,
who will likely be motivated to pay much more for the system.</p>
<p>another nice thought is that the teams that came &ldquo;very close&rdquo;
might be motivated to turn their systems into &ldquo;open source&rdquo;,
meaning that this technology could get a big boost very soon.</p>
<p>eventually, collaborative filtering systems like this one will
be able to pull out the &ldquo;needles&rdquo; from the huge &ldquo;haystack&rdquo;
of digital content that is now growing by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>think of collaborative filtering as a &ldquo;magnet&rdquo; to extract them,
customizing the results to every person&rsquo;s <em>specific</em> ratings&hellip;</p>
<p>the books you love, the movies you love, the music you love,
the art you love, the poetry you love, all delivered right to you,
effortlessly, without you having to do any searching.  magical.</p>
<p>this ability for artists and audience to connect directly &ndash;
with absolutely no middlemen or &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; required &ndash;
will boost the fortune of artists to a tremendous degree&hellip;</p>
