body: "I am creating a long checklist with an underscored tab at the beginning of
  each line and am having trouble getting the text that flows over onto the next line
  to line up. The attached file shows want I want to achieve, followed by want I am
  getting.\r\n\r\nif I hit enter where the line would break then set the indent in
  the tab settings it works but there must be a better way.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the
  best way to go about this?"

    where you want the text to align to. That should make all the text in the paragraph
    align to that point.\r\n\r\nOr I may have misunderstood you\u2026"
