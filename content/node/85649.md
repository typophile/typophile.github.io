  body: "I suppose he means that it is a font for printing ancient Greek, since it
    has some of the accents...\r\n\r\nbut those it has are not centered, and the final
    sigma looks oddly bold, so I can see the reason for your comment.\r\n\r\nIf only
    an approximate match is required, GFS Philostratos might be considered."
