  also enable me to print out a sample of each of the fonts I have?  I like looking
  through a paper library rather than online.\r\n\r\nI have used Suitcase in the past
  and think that the management tools in there are pretty cool, but is there any free
  software that is similar or as good for the mac?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."
