body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm hoping for some help with FontLab. I'm pretty new to
  the program and am having some difficulties when pasting in from illustrator. Based
  on a friend's good knowledge, I think the glyphs are pasting as a background layer,
  as they are not editable and show as a filled object rather than outlines like they
  normally would. Hopefully this makes sense. Does anyone know how to turn off [?]
  pasting as a background layer?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!\r\n\r\nRo"

  body: "One simple way: In Illustrator use your select tool to go around a glyph.
    You should see the nodes highlighted. Do copy. Open a new blank file. Paste the
    information. You should see just the gyph. If you see more, delete the extra stuff
    -- this may be simple or complex depending on your source. Transform by expanding
    scale, e.g. 500%. Copy. Paste into FontLab. Adjust scale. Close open contours
    etc.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for the help. I don't think that's the issue though, unless I'm not
    understanding you fully. I am definitely just pasting the glyph in to FontLab,
    no 'extra stuff' and the glyphs are already at the correct size for the FontLab
    file, any bigger and it just pastes in as the correct size but still as what I'm
    guessing is a background layer.

  body: Make sure that in the FontLab editing layer palette all of the layers are
    checked - then you should be able to just copy and paste into a glyph window.
    If it does not work - what version of Illustrator and FontLab are you using?

    body: Thanks bojev. Doesn't work as far as I can tell but, maybe I'm not actioning
      your instructions correctly! There's a strong possibility. I'm using FontLab
      Studio 5 and Illustrator CS6.

    the glyph is shown as an outline and whatever I paste in appears like this, in
    purple. I'm not able to edit the glyph at all.\r\n\r\nThanks again everyone for
    trying to help I really appreciate it! I'm sure it's a silly thing but am not
    experienced enough in FontLab to work this out easily...!"

    hidden or disabled. FWIW, I don't use FontLab as much as I used to, so I might
    be forgetting something. \r\n\r\nIf none of these suggestions work, I would recommend
    you ask over at the FontLab user forum. People who work at FontLab often answer.

  body: "How come you mention shapes having a fill, yet in the picture you posted
    there is no letter apart from the one that is in the background, which is default
    in FontLab. Are you actually seeing the letter you past into FontLab at all? Because
    I can imagine if you copy/paste straight from Illustrator, your letters may be
    pasted into FontLab too small to see, or outside of the field. I have a separate
    Illustrator file that correlates to the dimensions of FontLab, so I don't actually
    copy/paste from the Illustrator file where I have the typeface directly into FontLab.
    I copy/paste the shapes into the secondary Illustrator file with the correct dimensions,
    and copy/paste that into FontLab.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you do see your letters but
    they have no counters anymore, one of your nodes is broken. If this is the case
    you will notice a cross over the broken node. Select the node in Illustrator and
    press Cntrl + J. This will join the node(s) so it's not broken anymore. I've experienced
    sometimes when working in different versions of Illustrator (CS5 and CS6 for example),
    sometimes some of the nodes will break. You don't actually see that until you
    copy/paste your design into FontLab, in which case your letter has a complete
    fill without any counters.\r\n\r\nIf you're not experiencing either issue, I have
    no idea what's going on. I've never had FontLab turning layers off or losing the
    ability to edit your shapes in FontLab."
