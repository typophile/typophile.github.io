body: "Hello dear Typophiles,\r\nThis is my first post, after sneaking around for
  a long time , I think it is finally my turn to ask.\r\n\r\nI am working on a magazine
  project, whatever I did, I couldn't come up with a nice charming justification setting.
  I've inspected other magazine designs online and on press, and I've realized that
  designer has to sacrifice a part while saving other parts in justification, like
  to keep the letter spacing and glyph scaling on reasonable levels (or not using
  at all), usually word space is sacrificed excessively.\r\nI've spent nearly two
  of my weeks just measuring many possibilities. Before I go nuts, I've decided to
  consult you people out there about some things.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nAbout my design,
  here are the key points of my design that I've learnt here what affects justification:\r\n<strong>Column
  width</strong> is 156.882pt\r\n<strong>Font</strong> is Minion Pro (10pt) / -10
  Tracking\r\n<strong>Type of magazine</strong> is Economy (long words are common)\r\n<strong>Justification
  settings</strong>: Word S.:80/133, Letter S.:-3/+3 , glyph scaling: 98/102, Adobe
  Paragraph Composer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is to keep minimum word space
  on reasonable levels on a real basis of between 90% and 100%, as I don't want too
  close words one near another, loose lines would be okay to make a sacrifice for
  now. Also I don't know if I can explain but when I look at a column, I want to be
  able to pick words when I look at a column, when I seek my eyes across columns I
  want them to be pick-able, noticeable, I don't want them to get lost in column crowd,
  I don't know how you guys call this phenomena.\r\n\r\nSo when I alter the settings,
  for example between 80% and 99%, there is not really a big difference at all, til
  I make it 100%, then it gives me what I want. There's a huge difference between
  99% and 100%, 99% is not \"99%\" at all. I also realized that letter spacing and
  glyph scaling changes the word spacing, regardless of word spacing preferences,
  not even mentioning hyphenation settings now, so everything is messed up for me.
  I have really started to doubt about the practicability of indesign's justification
  algorithm, sometimes it is just so out of proportions.\r\n\r\nI really would love
  some example justification settings as start that I can stay sane with Minion Pro
  I guess.Thanks already for your kind responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Screenshot of some
  too close word spacing I work on (justification settings are same as above) : <a

    with justification. Have you considered making it rag right?

  body: "The justification engine in InDesign is a complex beast and the relationship
    between the values in the Justification settings and the results is far from obvious.
    \r\n\r\nThe numbers that are entered in the Justification settings of InDesign
    are parameters. These parameters are then used to establish a \u201Cscoring\u201D
    system that the algorithm uses to evaluate the various possibilities of adding
    or removing space to justify a line. This is typically used in conjunction with
    an evaluation of all reasonable hyphenation points as well (according to the parameters
    set in the Hyphenation Settings), so it is all quite interconnected.\r\n\r\nAt
    the end of which, InDesign applies the solution with the least-bad score. If you
    selected the Single-line Composer, then it will move on and not look back. \r\n\r\nIf
    you have selected the Adobe Paragraph Composer, then it will look forward and
    backward through all the lines in the paragraph (and all their possible scores)
    and adjust them to achieve the best *average* least-bad scores over the range,
    which may or may not yield an optimum score for any given line.\r\n\r\nSetting
    Optimum word spacing to 99% only yields 99% of the font\u2019s nominal wordspace
    value on the last, unjustified line of a paragraph. For all other lines, it just
    resets the reference point from which the algorithm calculates the score. \r\n\r\nIn
    many, many cases, there are only a few reasonable break points for justifying
    a given line of text within the constraints of a setting (e.g., the content, the
    font, the size, the line-length). So, minor twiddling of the optimum value may
    not change the results at all.\r\n\r\nThe Minimum Word Spacing value establishes
    the smallest word space that the algorithm will allow in its calculations of possible
    justification settings for a line. InDesign\u2019s engine will calculate using
    only word spacing until it reaches that minimum, after which it will then start
    applying negative letter-spacing down to the minimum value set for that parameter.
    After which is will continue by reducing glyph width, down to the minimum value
    set for that parameter.\r\n\r\nTake note that decreasing letter-spacing (and glyph
    scaling, to some extent) will have a continued effect on the perceived word space.
    I don\u2019t know if letter-spacing continues to operate directly on the word
    space itself (I\u2019m pretty sure it does when applying manual tracking, for
    instance), but at the very least, it reduces the space on either side of the word
    space because of the reduced sidebearings on the adjacent letters.\r\n\r\nIn a
    quick test I just did, it looks like -3% letter-spacing for Minion yields a word
    space that looks roughly equivalent to 94%.\r\n\r\nSo, I might guess that in the
    particular example that you cited, where changing minimum word spacing value below
    99% did not yield appreciable difference, what was likely happening is that you
    were just exchanging letter-spacing for word spacing.\r\n\r\nIf you had a setting
    where the solution arrived at by the algorithm involved word space values in the
    94% range, and then you changed the minimum limit to greater than 95%, the engine
    would start applying letter-spacing instead and would likely arrive at a similar
    solution which used something like -2.5% letterspacing and yielded word spaces
    that were very close to where you started from \u2014 no appreciable difference.\r\n\r\nThe
    more word spaces there are in a given line, the more likely this reciprocal exchange
    of letter space for word space.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nice write up of the process, Kent.\r\n\r\nIMO Americans mishandle workspaces
    and the standard settings in InDesign reflect this \u2014 way too wide. Wordspaces
    should be in the range of the widths of /i/ to /n/ for serif type and in the range
    of 'up to' or 'around' the width of /n/ for sans.\r\n\r\nA good way to define
    the settings is to start with the Letter space and Character scaling locked to
    100% and begin with just the Word space settings (I start with something like
    75/90/100), playing around with that and choosing an optimum for the desired effect.
    \r\nThen you\u2019d add some latitude for Character scaling (just a few percents
    both way).\r\nYou should forget about Letter space \u2014 that\u2019s just plain
    bad and ugly."

  body: "Just to clarify: Setting the Maximum word space to 100 does not prevent the
    justification engine from using word spaces much larger than that. I think this
    is a common misunderstanding. (Not necessarily you, Bert; you probably know what
    you\u2019re doing.)\r\n\r\nThe Maximum word space value establishes the upper
    bound when calculating possible justification schemes for a line. But if the justification
    engine cannot find a way to justify a line within the given parameters, then as
    a last resort it will only add extra space to justify.\r\n\r\nThat is to say:
    if the constraints in the H&Js are too limiting, then it\u2019s entirely possible
    to get lines that are very loose, where the justification engine was unable to
    find an acceptable solution and had to throw up its hands and just space out the
    line.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s counterintuitive, but setting your parameters too narrowly
    can sometimes yield more loose and gappy lines."

  body: "@James, I think I will stay with justification, because whether I try to
    widen the columns or not, in 3 column outline I guess I won't get to a result
    that satisfies me soon.\r\n\r\n@riccard0, thanks, I didn't know we could do google
    search on Typophile, the one it has not really functioning properly if you ask
    me.\r\n\r\n@kentlew, thank you for the long explanation! that was really helpful.
    Now I realize whatever I do won't help me to achieve such effect because so many
    variations are interconnected to each other, I think I can only come out with
    something \"agreeable\". Also your last post made me \"illuminated\" once again
    because that is what I was talking about at first, algorithm of InDesign doesn't
    let us go straight with the numbers but does it's own way. So I was trying to
    make minimum space 100%, or maximum space 100%, realized both doesn't let me stay
    in the exact amounts, only on average \"100%\"s. I guess the only way would be
    to find something average and rewrite the lines, which is not practical at all.\r\n\r\n@Bert
    Vanderveen as in the screenshots below I've tried according to your suggestions
    and Kentlew's, and some other adjustments visible. If you open the images in new
    tab there are h&j settings on the right of the images.\r\n\r\nAs in this picture,
    letter spacing downed to 0.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ss1_6058.png]\r\n\r\nThese
    are my current settings, as you can see f and t letters are nearly being a ligature,
    I may be exaggerating. But as you can see at the second and last line on the image,
    the word spacing is pretty tight.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ss2_4551.png]\r\n\r\nOn
    this last image, I put down all values to 0 more or less, but now indesign highlighted
    all of my two pages nearly, and it is right because the minimum word spacing is
    likely preserved, but now I'm afraid of big gaps everywhere even leading to something
    worse: rivers\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ss3_5335.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    thought I might have come to something satisfactory with using -20 tracking (these
    images are in -10 tracking), then I realized I will be sacrificing less glyph
    scaling, and less of letter spacing (used nearly none of both). Word spaces were
    mildy improved. But then I am not sure how Minion Pro would look with -20 tracking
    , I haven't tested it yet that way. \r\n\r\nI also would like to ask, how much
    should one care about indesign's h&j violations? Because when I change the letter
    spacings to 0 and glyph scaling also to 0 (while adjusting other settings mildly),
    there is not even line changes on most of the page. Only glyphs move on nanometric
    levels, some letter spacing, but not even a word moves to next line.The only difference
    between -3 letter spacing and 0 spacing is just indesign's making it \"highlighted\"
    sometimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
