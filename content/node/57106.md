body: "Ok so I'm making a logo for a photographer. \r\nShe plans to shoot anything
  and everything, but her own personal style\r\nis a lot of macros of natural things
  like plants and insects.\r\n\r\nSo I got a logo here that is using the symbol for
  a roll of film, creating\r\na butterfly. There are 2 versions which I am posting,
  the only thing being\r\ndifferent is the orientation of the butterfly's antennae,
  and the spacing\r\nof the \"wings.\" \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the mark?\r\n\r\nAnd
  the typography is just kind of thrown on there,\r\nif possible I would love some
  suggestions on some good\r\nscripts and sans-serifs that are free, or that I may
  potentially \r\nhave in my library already. \r\n\r\nPlus any suggestions as you
  see fit. Thank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Version1_4632.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Version2_3487.jpg]"

    am trying to make it cute--and I thought the antennae helped do so by making\r\na
    little creature out of an otherwise formal and rigid mark.\r\n\r\nBut yes making
    a flower out of the icon had occurred to me. Let me play around\r\na bit and tomorrow
    I will post a spin-off concept. Thanks"

    the font, so I'm just kind of\r\nthrowing it in there as a jpeg in the original
    black. \r\nFinal versions I think would be purple. (assuming i stay with that
    color scheme.\r\n\r\nShould i stay with a single color? If 2 colors, which version?\r\n\r\nand
    as always, anything else that comes to anyone's mind, much appreciated[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Version1_3611.jpg]"

    and the antennae seem too tight, also. I'd give it all some air. The mark is too
    whimsical to feel so rigid. \r\n\r\nI do like the colors you've chosen. Have you
    tried it with just the inner circles orange? Or the text purple and the mark orange?
    \r\n\r\nOverall, it's coming along rather nicely."

  body: "New versions:\r\n\r\nWill--Created a flower out of the symbol as mentioned.
    Although I myself am still leaning towards the butterfly.\r\n\r\nAlaskan--I spaced
    the mark out a little bit as requested. I certainly had thought of making the
    inner circles the lighter color, here's what it would look like.\r\n\r\nBut this
    leads me to a conceptual question that i'm struggling with. I included in the
    far right of the image, the basic black film roll icon. The mark I created refers
    to that icon, though I admit it is no longer simply a film roll--it is now a butterfly.
    But in the way that the icon uses the same color for both inner and outer circle,
    should i do so for MY mark? Does changing the color of the inner and outer circles
    (as opposed to using a two color scheme in which the inner and outer are always
    the same color--as in the previous versions) take away from the idea that this
    mark has to do with photography?\r\n\r\nAnd in the last version I post, I almost
    get the read of binoculars which has to do with optics and lenses, seeing...photography.
    \r\n\r\nAny other opinions or input?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Version2_4603.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Version3_4925.jpg]\r\n\r\nPS.
    Alaskan--haven't bought the font, so that arrow says \"purple text,\" which can
    happen when i buy that thing"

  body: I think the type should be on the right of the butterfly ragged right, aligned
    perhaps with the top and bottom of the bottom row. Nice mark, but I don't think
    those are very butterflyish colours. Something more photographic, RGB, silver
    halide foil block?

  body: "You may be correct about rag right. I'm not sure if I can drop the caps treatment
    on the word Photography then... what do you guys vote for, caps or no?\r\n\r\nOk
    people--I apologize for getting color crazy. But I've sourced some RGBs from pictures
    of butterflies. I don't think the tri-color treatment works though. It looks to
    me as though having a diff. color for the outer circle and antennae screws with
    immediately recognizing the butterfly. I tried a whole range of colors, clearly,
    sorry... as well as a black and silver combination--of which there are 3 shades
    of gray.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that many butterflies are duo-tone, with black
    edges.\r\nSo I'm now leaning towards the two with black outer circles, and blue,
    then red inner, respectively. Or one of the ones below those two that feature
    gray inner circles (there's something elegant about them).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Version4_5688.jpg]"

    it's close in length to your client's name, which becomes a bit distracting to
