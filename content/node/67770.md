body: "Victoria Espinel, the new I.P Czar (officially the U.S. Intellectual Property
  Enforcement Coordinator), is soliciting suggestions on how to improve the state
  of intellectual property law and enforcement in this country. There are a number
  of more formal requirements (see the open request form [[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fedreg_2010/02232010_ipi.pdf|here]]),
  but I think this could be a great opportunity to get the voice of the digital type
  industry heard. I don\u2019t personally have the time or the well-developed, responsible
  worldview to put together a cogent proposal myself, but I imagine there are some
  great minds here that are more than up to the challenge. \r\n\r\nSubmissions need
  to be in by March 24, 2010.\r\n[[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/02/23/intellectual-property-and-risks-public]]\r\n"
