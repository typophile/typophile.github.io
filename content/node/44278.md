  the discussion was someone asking for the font Muse uses for their logotype, which
  is frutiger:\r\n\r\nhttp://board.muse.mu/showthread.php?t=2591\r\n\r\nThe conversation
  quickly turns to people requesting / offering to share the font files with others.
  This prompted me to sign up for the message board just so I could post a little
  comment (at the end) about font awareness. I was rather disturbed by such a blatant
  violation (especially by the second to last poster who seems to have posted it Frutiger
  for download). Has anyone come across stuff like this before? It would seem to me
  that it's like trying to bail the titanic out with a teaspoon. If so, what measures
  do you usually take?\r\n\r\nAnyway,  none of these people will be likely to read
  (or care about) my comment because the thread is from a while ago.\r\n"

    sure this happens in lots of places, and you're right that its tough to fight
    against.\r\nI'd think that if the font file was actually posted on the boards,
    depending on the site, you could report that post as abuse and ask the administrators
    to take it down, since it's essentially promoting software theft.\r\n\r\nJason

  body: Yes, it's all over the place. At the same time, it appears to be kids wanting
    to decorate their own fan sites. So, it's wrong, but probably not the biggest
    fish to go after.

  body: "I agree it's not the worst case scenario, and i know we can't go around finding
    all the cases of this, but it's just a real annoyance. Just seeing each instance
    of even asking for a single font from a typeface, you just tally in your head:
    there's $29, there's another $29.\r\n\r\nI guess you instill respect for digital
    media when you can download a song of itunes for a dollar. To the uninformed,
    it's not so far fetched to not understand type costs a lot more. I guess the number
    of replies to this thread suggests that nobody here is all that surprised."

    The problem is that most music is downloaded free. I asked my college class of
    30 students on Tuesday if anyone had ever downloaded and paid for a song. They
    acted like I was crazy. To them songs are free and only crazy people would pay
    for them.\r\n\r\nAll iTunes does is allow those people who don't want to steal
    music a chance to do so."

  body: "I wasn't really saying that Itunes is a problem. Itunes is my sole source
    of music purchases. Logically, a thirteen dollar with thirteen tracks comes out
    to about that. I was more or less saying (albeit unclearly) that if the maximum
    you would ever pay for a song was a dollar, it's hard to see a teenager willing
    to pay even $20 for one weight. I mean to say, that they probably have no indication
    of the work that goes into a typeface, or it's net worth (i mean OBVIOUSLY a single
    song by My Chemical Romance is worth more than a \"stupid\" font).\r\n\r\nPlease
    read that sentence with a sarcastic tone.\r\n\r\nThe node recently created about
    Letterhead Fonts indirectly leads to this instance, which is a much worse violation
    than I seem to have found:\r\nhttp://www.gfxworld.org/fonts/new_fonts_5.html\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    guess the summation of this thread is: They're kids, and what harm can they really
    do? There are bigger fish to fry. Okay, I agree, but i think it's still death
    by 1,000 cuts to some degree."
