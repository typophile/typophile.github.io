  format\r\n(.shp) to  .gdf file (Tele Atlas implementation) but I don't know gdf
  data structures. Can you send to me gdf data structures? I have read documentations
  at links following: \r\n http://www.ertico.com/en/links/links/gdf_-_geographic_data_files.htm\r\n
  http://www.4d-technologies.com/writegdf/ \r\nBut these documentations are difficult
  to me writing a tool to convert from shp file to gdf file. Have you got this tool
  or source code to gdf read and write? If this is a licence, how can I buy it?\r\n\r\nBest
  regards"
