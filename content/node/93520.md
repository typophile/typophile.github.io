  and it said the closest match was Saloon Girl from Font Mesa but Saloon Girl has
  these little nodes on the letters that the logo does not. I know it's possible that
  this could be a font that was taken and altered to create the logo but I was just
  curious if anyone had any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance! =)"
