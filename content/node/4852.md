  as XXVII and iX or simply V with connecting strands of Roman Numerals? just wondering....

  body: Roman numerals actually have their own codepoints in Unicode &#40;goofy though
    that might seem&#41;. So, you can just use those codepoints. <BR> <BR>In addition,
    or instead, if you want a substitution feature to exchange default forms for ones
    that have connecting serifs, I&#39;d suggest simply using stylistic sets. I can&#39;t
    see roman numerals being common enough to justify their own unique feature. <BR>

  body: i knew i had seen those unicode character slots somewhere. i realize this
    would be totally useless to anybody but me, but i was curious. and since i have
    no shame... what are stylistic sets?

  body: I didn&#39;t say Roman numerals were goofy. I said it was goofy that they
    had their own slots in Unicode. <BR> <BR>Although, on further consideration, it
    is true that they have semantically different meaning than the same glyphs used
    as letters, so the argument that they should have separate Unicodes is not without
    merit. Still, I suspect that their existence in Unicode is due to compatibility
    with some other encoding. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas,  <BR> <BR>I think Roman numerals should have their own Unicode values.
    The difference between European numerals and Roman numerals are somewhat like
    between uppercase and lowercase -- they share some characteristics, but are also
    different in some regard. For example, in scientific or legal texts, Roman numerals
    may designate a different level of structure than the European numerals, so keeping
    them separate makes sense.  <BR> <BR>Encoding Roman numerals as a mere styllistic
    variants of European digits isn&#39;t obvious at all -- you would need to do very
    elaborate contextual substitutions.  <BR> <BR>First, because depending on the
    position within the number, the European numeral converts to a different Roman
    numeral, and secondly, obviously, because for certain numbers, the Roman numeral
    must be repeated. So for example, 4444 translates to MMMMCDXLIV. Making an OpenType
    layout feature that does the conversion is possible but not trivial. Also, in
    some older sources, alternate renditions of various Roman numbers were used, e.g.
    XXC = LXXX, IC = XCIX, IIXX = XVIII. Therefore, I think it&#39;s better when Roman
    numerals have their own Unicodes.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam

  body: I was actually thinking of treating them as variants of European &#42;letters&#42;.
    But since they have their own legitimate Unicodes, and the semantic meaning of
    the letters is quite different, that would be against the philosophies of Unicode
    and OpenType. <BR> <BR>That being said, the practical implication is that you
    stick the characters in the font, but have no easy way to input them, unless you
    use a custom keyboard setup. Otherwise, you&#39;ll have to hunt and peck them
    from a utility palette &#40;glyph palette / character palette / character map&#41;.

  body: WoW! OT converting Arabic numerals to Roman? I hadn&#39;t even thought of
    that! And i&#39;m afraid i&#39;m not that ambitious to try to figure it out. I
    just meant a feature that would Roman caps symbolizing numerals into forms that
    actually link with each other. That&#39;s all, nuffin more.

  body: 'Here&#39;s info on Stylistic Sets from the spec: <BR> <BR>Function: In addition
    to, or instead of, stylistic alternatives of individual glyphs &#40;see &#39;salt&#39;
    feature&#41;, some fonts may contain sets of stylistic variant glyphs corresponding
    to portions of the character set, e.g. multiple variants for lowercase letters
    in a Latin font. Glyphs in stylistic sets may be designed to harmonise visually,
    interract in particular ways, or otherwise work together. Examples of fonts including
    stylistic sets are Zapfino Linotype and Adobe&#39;s Poetica. Individual features
    numbered sequentially with the tag name convention &#39;ss01&#39; &#39;ss02&#39;
    &#39;ss03 ... &#39;ss20&#39; provide a mechanism for glyphs in these sets to be
    associated via GSUB lookup indexes to default forms and to each other, and for
    users to select from available stylistic sets. <BR> <BR>Recommended implementation:
    An ssXX table maps GIDs for default forms to one GIDs for corresponding stylistic
    alternatives in each set. Each ssXX feature uses one-to-one &#40;GSUB lookup type
    1&#41; substitutions. Font developers may choose to map only from default forms
    to variants for each stylistic set, or may choose to map between all stylistic
    sets in each feature, depending on intended user experience. For example, feature
    &#39;ss03&#39; might contain lookups mapping variant glyphs from &#39;ss01&#39;
    and &#39;ss02&#39; to corresponding variants in &#39;ss03&#39;, in addition to
    mapping from default forms. <BR> <BR>Application interface: Note that the application
    is responsible for counting and enumerating the number of features in the font
    with tag names of the format &#39;ss01&#39; to &#39;ss20&#39;, and for presenting
    the user with an appropriate selection mechanism. For GIDs found in the ssXX coverage
    table, the application passes the GIDs to the ssXX table and gets back one or
    more new GIDs. <BR> <BR>UI suggestion: This feature should be off by default.
