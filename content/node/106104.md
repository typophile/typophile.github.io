  nor a font/typeface designer. However I am fascinated with fonts, their history,
  philosophy and art. And of course their creators.\r\n\r\nSince there is a note saying
  that any subject can be posted to this forum, here is where I am doing so. However,
  if there is a more appropriate forum to do so, I would be grateful to know about
  it.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nShab\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sort of taking you at your word...\r\n\r\nFor handset type, up until the
    1890s, I'd recommend Updike's <cite>Printing Types, Their History, Forms, and
    Use: A Study in Survivals</cite>\r\n\r\nOne link:\r\nhttp://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/printing-types/author/daniel-berkeley-updike/page-1/\r\n\r\nIf
    you've used Abe's I'd reorient the search for hardcover, and most reliable retailers,
    then get whatever condition your budget allows. I've been at this over 30 years,
    and still consult Updike from time to time. Remember there are two volumes.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, there is always Amazon,\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Printing-Types-Their-History-Forms/dp/1584560568\r\n\r\nbut
    I don't think I'd want it (judgement not made by having one to hand). There was
    a good edition under the imprint of The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,
    1966.\r\n\r\nFor an interesting exploration on how the initial machines affected
    things, esp, Monotype, one picture -- or one tiny part, maybe -- is Dowding's
    <cite>Factors in the Choice of Type Faces</cite>. Wace edition, if at all possible.
    Skip the other Dowding book.\r\n\r\nAs you get into photocomp & the contemporary
    era, everyone's probably got an opinion. While I don't agree with some of what
    Kinross' author's say, I don't think anyone would debate the importance/quality
    of what the Hyphen Press publishes.\r\n\r\nhttp://hyphenpress.co.uk/"

    history of type.\r\n\r\nHow type relates to history in general, though, has only
    been hinted at in asides; i.e. that its development suffered in Spain and Russia
    because of heavy censorship. How it relates to philosophy has been touched on
    hardly at all.\r\n\r\nIt's not a coincidence that the Netherlands, home of the
    Elzevirs, has been very influential. Caslon, and even Times Roman, both show a
    profound Dutch influence."

  body: "Such a vast area.\r\nSome examples on history and art movements:\r\n1. Blackletter
    typefaces were an essential part of the issue of German cultural identity from
    the 15th century until about 1942, as opposed to the countries in the area formerly
    ruled by the Roman Empire. See  _Blackletter: Type and National Identity_ edited
    by Peter Bain and Paul Shaw, 1998 ISBN 1-56898-2.\r\n2. The development of display
    typography in the 19th century was fueled by the rise of the consumer society.
    Visual advertising was contested between typography and lithography. Type makers
    continually innovated to try and match the visual impact of lithography.\r\n3.
    The rise of imperialism, jingoism, and assertiveness circa 1898 shifted typographic
    interest from fine esthetics and carefully constructed artistic printing to strong
    typefaces, such as Doric, a heavy sans designed for scare-head newspaper headlines
    such as \"War in Cuba.\" \r\n4. The breakdown of Western Civilization's consensus
    of rationality, order and optimism in the early 20th century spawned radical new
    thinking in politics and the arts, including new typefaces which were designed
    for crude impact. \r\n5. The post WWI zeitgeist of technological advances and
    sleek new products produced the Art Deco ethos, which included the geometric and
    simplified designs for typefaces\r\n6. Science Fiction created a demand for futuristic
    technology typefaces, usually very simplified with bizarre features.\r\nI trust
    you can think of many others.\r\nDon \r\n"

  body: "Also interesting are historical advances that did <em>not</em> affect the
    appearance of type \u2014 such as, for instance, the invention of printing. Gutenberg,
    of course, gave us his best impression of the scribal hand of a monk.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the invention of digital type began not with forms that arose naturally out of
    the limitations of the medium but with desperate imitations of the best of the
    metal type era.\r\n\r\nOne possible conclusion: historical shifts outside the
    realm of typography have a more profound impact on the forms of letters than technological
    shifts within typography.\r\n\r\nThough this does ignore the contributions of
    individual designers, who, after all, are the people responsible for advances
    in the design of type."

  body: "Type design is a very narrow and specific subject, when you focus just on
    letter forms. However, it lies at the intersection of art, science, industry,
    literature and culture, so in another way what is relevant to its history is vast.
    So really you have to start with a specific question\u2014almost any will do,
    but it needs to be authentic, coming from you, and specific, if you are to make
    satisfying progress in your efforts, in my opinion. So what is your specific question?\r\n\r\nBasic
    more recent works than Updike that will give you some grounding are Bringhurst's
    <em>Elements of Typographic Style</em>, though it is narrower than it presents
    itself, and <em>Letters of Credit</em> by Tracy, which is broader than it presents
    itself."

  body: "I agree that it's sometimes useful to have a wide open brainstorming session
    at the start of a project as unfocused as this one. But then choices have to be
    made. Various posters have suggested a wide range of topics. This would be a good
    time for you to try and specify some terms of reference for your project. After
    you have some results is the time to look at a variation or a new issue.\r\nAs
    \ a final comment, the references suggested are excellent and a worthwhile use
    of your time, but I would suggest that you also spend some time looking critically
    at a few type specimens from different periods -- some of the books have fonts
    organized by time period -- and ask some simple questions such as why did a new
    type design or fashion meet a need at that time and why was it abandoned later.
    The answer varies and says a lot about changing cultural values, technology, current
    events etc.\r\nDon"

  body: "Don, the arts are not merely reactive, but, being part of cultural ecology,
    shape civilization.\r\n\r\nFor instance, with regard to your explanation of Art
    Deco, why did earlier eras of technological advances not produce Art Deco? And
    isn\u2019t it putting the cart before the horse to say that \u201Csleek new products\u201D
    gave rise to Art Deco?\r\n\r\nParadoxically, the technological advances of the
    early 20th century were employed in the commercial arts to produce historicism.
    That was Benton\u2019s agenda at ATF for Linotype, and Morison\u2019s at Monotype.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, I don't see Benton an historicist. Is Hobo historicist? Or Souvenir?
    \ Benton just tried to produce better crafted versions of whatever was out there,
    plus some new designs like Clearface, and other things. To me he didn't really
    have an overall agenda, other than to sell type. He did have an approach to type,
    which was to keep himself invisible, and sell good craftsmanship. The historicism
    was under way, with William Morris having made it fashionable in the 90s. M.F.
    Benton is just riding the crest of all the various waves passing by. \r\n\r\nMorrison
    was clearly historicist, but even he is complicated. Monotype did revivals before
    his influence, and he championed Gill, and at least backed Times New Roman, which
    wasn't really historicist. "

  body: "[Corrected post. Had bad connection and I mangled my post]\r\nGood points
    Nick. \r\nPerhaps what we have is a mutual influence process between technology,
    the arts, current events etc. The influence is clearly not one way.  Each is both
    initiator and recipient. \r\nThere is no hope of a \"true\" explanation that attempts
    to describe a complex relationship in a few words.  My terse phrase about Art
    Deco clearly lends itself to interpretations that could indeed be seen as \"cart
    before the horse.\" This the reason for editing before publication. Unfortunately
    posting in an e-forum does not benefit from this.\r\nAs for Benton and Morrison,
    a few thoughts, with which you may or may not agree.\r\nBenton, encouraged by
    DeVinne during the Century project, was enamored by technology that could produce
    more precise typefaces. He was unsatisfied with the existing ATF font library,
    inherited from a hodgepodge of foundries and designers. His solution, as you note
    was historicism -- a quest to use new technology to produce revivals of the great
    designs of the 18th century and earlier that would meet the demands of industrial
    society. At ATF from the late 1890s onward he axed most of the fonts in the catalog
    -- with all their fascinating variety -- and directed the creation of a new precisely
    ordered, mechanized world of fonts. \r\nThe adoption of new technology was in
    itself a forces for font redesign. For example, designing fonts for Monotype and
    Linotype machines was subject to severe design restraints.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
