    you can make it much easier if you show us what you are trying to match. Please
    capture images to show, or include the actual links. The more work you expect
    us to do just to find your font samples, the less help you may actually get, because
    we get a lot of requests that don't require extra work first.\r\n\r\nThe next
    point I want to make is that you often will not find fonts, especially free ones
    (in case that's what you wanted for the charity site) when you are trying to duplicate
    someone's branded look. The Guardian has had type designed for them, and if it's
    available, it sure will not be free. Not sure about what Flickr and Snapfish use,
    but often commercial sites use custom fonts to maintain a unique look. They are
    not happy when other sites try to imitate their style, as a general rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n-

  body: "oh hai Mike,\r\n\r\nYes ok. I totally understand that they dont want anyone
    copying them...\r\n\r\nAnyway the situation is, I am not a designer- I'm just
    a marketing exec, and I have been thrown into the very deep end. so I thought
    why waste time researching what kind of fonts to use,lets just use tried and tested.
    Bad idea definitely.\r\n\r\nOk here's a link to the home page of this website
    (I know, I know, its coming along)\r\nhttp://myexphone.com/myexphone/Default.aspx\r\n\r\nand
    the logo is just a bunch of recycling arrows.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest what font
    will work well on this page.\r\n\r\nI thought of these:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cooper-old-style/urw-t-bold/\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/caxton/\r\n\r\nwhich
    I think comes close.\r\n\r\nplease help!!!\r\n\r\npic related:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/guardian_logo_6065.gif]"

    look, I just thought it would be a better approach to talk to someone who does
    design, rather than marketing. Maybe you should start a thread on the design forum
    here. I'm sure you would get many opinions, even many helpful ones.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "emmm... no budget for a designer but you would like to recreate a brand that
    is heavily design-lead (Guardian) maybe you need to re-work not only the budget
    but also the brief with your client.\r\nAdding the Guardian's font  will not aid
    your client in any way, branding is far more involved than just choosing a font,
    and if i may be so bold, hiring a web designer would be a good idea to.\r\nMartin"

    \r\n\r\nEither this project needs good design or it doesn't. \r\n\r\nIf it doesn't
    need good design... just go to DaFont and grab anything and don't worry about
    how it looks. \r\n\r\nIf design is important... hire a designer. It really is
    that simple. As with Mike and Barkeep, I'm only trying to give helpful, professional
    design advice. Either you got it, or you don't. You can't learn this stuff in
    a few weeks.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are some nice, close matches to the Guardian Egyptian
    font. But I will be honest and say that I wouldn't divulge to someone who would
    use them as fuel in a fiery plane crash."
