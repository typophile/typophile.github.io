  seemed to be a Miller & Richard Bohemian, yet I found out the foundry specimen and
  the Nick Curtis digital revival and the two typefaces have both strong similarities
  and differences:\r\n\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/NickCurtis--MillrichMoravian-2010--afterMiller+Richard-Bohemian-1918b.gif\r\n\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/NickCurtis--MillrichMorovianNF-2010.gif\r\n\r\nThis
  could be some kind of rip-off between foundries and it's gonna be very difficult
  to ID my very font.\r\n\r\nDo you have any clues?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\na.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, it will be difficult. This could be the original from which Miller and
    Richards\u2019 version was derived, or it could be the other way around\u2026or
    they both could have been derived from a third source, perhaps Swiss. Happy hunting."
