body: "So I'm curious if there is a way to do the following:\r\n\r\nI have a document
  that is setup as a template.\r\nThere are two pages in the document, one that is
  in color and one that is in grayscale.\r\n\r\nThese templates have text modified
  and then are saved foreach vendor. The modifications to the color are axactly the
  same as to the grayscale. Is thre I way I can duplicate the text from the first
  to the second? Like a symbol instance in illustrator, you would change the parent
  and all the children would change? I'm trying to think of an easy way to do this.
  (aside from just copy and pasting items)\r\n\r\nHelp is appreciated."
