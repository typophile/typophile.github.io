  shrunk since the last update. Before I had a tracklist which went over one or two
  pages, now I have only 11 entries. Also haven\u2019t found out how those remaining
  entries have survived. Some are a few weeks old, others are years old.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tracklist_5090.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  someone having the same problem, or is that just me?\r\n\r\nI hope the postings
  are not gone. Was easier to find recent postings \u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry if
  that was discussed before, but haven\u2019t found something alike. \r\n\r\n"

    they're doing everything they can to fix this soon.
