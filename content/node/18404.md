  wooden motorboats. i've had a lot of trouble with it, specifically with the 'RAS'
  letter combo, and i could use some expert eyes. any advice is greatly appreciated...\r\n\r\n/aaron"

  body: Lots of fun. Have you tried adding a little variation to the second S -- maybe
    it drops a little lower and wraps into the first -- or the second L? The way that
    the RA letter combo almost appears to be interacting is really nice. I might also
    consider varying the Bs a little.

  body: "thanks for the response.\r\nwell, i'm not exactly sure what you mean, but
    initially i did try doing things with the 'SS' pair. it seemed to make the wordmark
    feel unbalanced--more complicated on one side than the other... i just wasn't
    pulling it off right somehow, so i simplified it...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/masthead2.jpg]\r\n\r\n/aaron"

  body: i think the key is to find balance as you have seen. The right stroke on the
    A could fall down behind the normal stroke of the S (from the first jpg) and then
    the second S could interact with the first S. You could have a entrance swash
    on the first B and maybe an extra swash on the bottom loop of the second B, or
    maybe the E could interact a little with the first L or something like that. I
    guess it depends on how swashy you want it to become. Perhaps to see what is possible
    you could check out the <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/gallery/">gallery</a>
    at <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/">Letterhead Fonts</a>, there are some
    really great examples there.

  body: "As mentioned above I think you should look at the bottom strokes and alignment
    of the ELL, you could also look at making the letters slightly wider to match
    better the R & A; you could also look at modulating the stroke on the bottom counter
    of B, like the top counter, a slightly more protruding serif on the Bs and R might
    look good; the terminals of the Ss is a bit too decorative compared with the simpler
    strokes used for the other letters you could look at reducing the spiral shape.
    Overall though it is a friendly image that goes well with the handbuilt quality
    of wooden boats.\r\nTim"
