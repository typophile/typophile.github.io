    </a>or <a href = "http://www.linotype.com/1224/memphis-family.html">Memphis </a>.

  body: Ben, when I saw the sample, my thoughts also went immediately to Hoboken High,
    but it would have to be customized - for instance, the stroke is thicker, the
    point on the "M" comes to a complete vertex in the center, and the serifs on the
    "E" and "F" characters are longer than in Hoboken.  My guess is that this is a
    very generic and not-all-too-hard-to-make custom display that happens to resemble
    Hoboken.
