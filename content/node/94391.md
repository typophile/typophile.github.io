  anyone ever been able to purchase any of these fonts in the past? It seems like
  they are not for sale and haven't been for quite some time.\r\n"

  body: how unfortunate...i hope the clients paid him extremely well for those typefaces
    because I'm sure he could sell them for a long time to come....i want some of
    them quite a bit!

    of their bespoke designs in perpetuity, while others accede to having such use
    for a limited period of time, after which the type designer can  offer them to
    the public. '

  body: "I wrote to I\xF1igo back in 2008 with the same questions. He did explain
    the fonts were developed to exclusive use of Suite magazine and are not commercially
    available. Although he said the fonts may be available for sale in a near future,
    I think this will not happen (at least for now) as since then he developed more
    fonts for Suite and none became available. It's a pity as his designs are really
    impressive. Hope Suite staff know how lucky they are."
