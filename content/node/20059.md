body: "The Font I am searching for should have the character of a handwriting. Is
  as fast  and lively as a note, but although readable.   \r\nIt should not have a
  firm x-height and the letters should not have a strict baseline.     Many  Scripts
  I like (for example the Scripts of House Industries) are a little bit too clean.
  \       \r\nTherefore I first thought of Linotype Notec. But the font has some bad
  problems with some ligatures and the line strength is a bit too irregular and its
  a bit too grungy to me.\r\n\r\nA mix of Bello and Notec would be the best for me.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help."

    I am a bit discerning  : )"
