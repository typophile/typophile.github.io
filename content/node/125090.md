  what's the new Typophile all about?\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, all the archives
  have been preserved and we've even worked hard to ensure that URLs have remained
  as consistent as possible. You'll find old Forums content now grouped under an appropriate
  Community.\r\n\r\nTypophile has all always been about community. It's the relationships
  and conversations we've built together over years that has made Typophile what it
  is, so we've decided to double down on community. To this end, we've done a few
  things.\r\n\r\n<strong>Home. Optimized for mobile</strong>\r\nWe wanted to encourage
  quick and easy sharing, so we've built a status engine that gives you up to 329
  characters (ahem, Latin 1 + 2 if you're curious) to share a thought, link, or picture.
  Snapping found type and posting from your phone just got really easy.\r\n\r\nGot
  a few free moments? The new Typophile makes it even easier to scroll through updates
  and see what people are up to.\r\n\r\nGoodbye Forums. Hello, Communities\r\nWe are
  declaring the message board format dead and welcome Communities in their place.
  Active topics across all communities rise to the surface, allowing you to graze
  and discover new communities that pop up.\r\n\r\nAnyone can start a community! We
  hope that the new system encourages lots of meaningful groupings and activity.\r\n\r\nAlways
  Improving\r\nDespite the unfortunate hiatus, our commitment to Typophile remains
  stronger than ever. To that end, if you encounter bugs or design glitches, check
  the known issues and add it in the comments."
