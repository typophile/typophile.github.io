  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Din, actually. The sample is small, but it looks
    like it has rounded dots on the i. If you squished <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/aaux/regular/testdrive.html?s=The%2BCriterion%2BCollection&amp;p=36">Aaux</a>
    I think you&#39;d be closer but still not there. I know Neil Summerour is about
    to release versions of Aaux with OSFs, so it&#39;s possible that this might be
    an early release of that font, but it may just be something else.

  body: Hm, you&#39;re right.. DIN isn&#39;t as open, and where would those OSFs come
    from. Aaux looks great, I&#39;ll put that on my shopping list.

  body: Check out <a href="http://www.positype.com/">Neil&#39;s site</a>. It gives
    a glimpse of Aaux OSFs. <BR> <BR>I chose Aaux and Aaux Office as the only typefaces
    I use for my theater company, <a href="http://www.impacttheatre.com">Impact Theatre</a>.
    Check the site out for examples of Aaux in action.

  body: '... <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a tough call, but I still think it&#39;s DIN. The numbers
    are a much closer match than aaux. Because of the way the 4 looks vertically stetched,
    i think someone just made their own OSFs, badly.'

    on DIN. <BR> <BR>Weird. It must be Helvetica NEUE
