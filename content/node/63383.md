  FF's Super Grotesk close enough to look akin. \r\n\r\nFB's 'Nobel' is on the plate
  and looks almost just right - if it wasn't for the difference in weight. 'Nobel
  book' is too light to fit, 'Nobel Regular' feels almost bold.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know similar typefaces that might come close?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(top to bottom:
  SG-faux, Nobel-Book, Nobel-Reg) "
