  body: "That 'a' looks like a 'frankenglyph'. I doubt that's the way it looks in
    the original font. There may have been other editing of features from certain
    letters. Are these the only letters you have seen in this font?\r\n\r\nThe q is
    like something Arthur Baker does, but this doesn't match any of his fonts.\r\n\r\n-
