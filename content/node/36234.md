body: "Hi everybody!\r\n\r\n1.\r\n<em>Chumbitos</em> is an unicase & monospaced ultra-fat
  typeface I'm working on. Take a look on <a href=\"http://www.fictilia.org/stuff/Chumbitos_070817a.pdf\"><strong>this
  pdf</strong></a> and tell me what do you think about... ;-)\r\n\r\n2.\r\nSome days
  ago, after I've drawn all the basic glyphs -- Caps, lower-case, numbers and some
  diacritics --, my friend <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/14604\"><strong>Quincunx</strong></a>
  told me about some similarities between <em>Chumbitos</em> and <a href=\"http://neutura.org/Deuce.html\"><strong>Deuce</strong></a>.
  In fact, some glyphs are very very similar, but the <em>intentions</em> of mine
  are far from that, as you can see on the pdf. Well, I don't knew <em>Deuce</em>
  before to drawn <em>Chumbitos</em>, so what do you think about this kind of <em>situation</em>?
  Legally, Ethically, ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nundr"

  body: It's not uncommon to come to similar design solutions independently. I think
    these two typefaces are sufficiently different. Don't worry. You might want to
    rethink your 'M'. The thin stems don't work so well and a different solution will
    set yours apart even more.

  body: "Thank you Stephen. I'm very neurotic with this kind of stuff... :-)\r\nAnd
    I think you're right about the 'M', and I extend it to the 'N' to... They are
    not so <em>consistent</em> with all the other glyphs... Maybe I didn't saw it
    because the '@': it's killing me... ;-D\r\nThank you again."

  body: "Well, I already said I liked it! :)\r\nAnd I agree with Stephen that similarities
    are not uncummon. Some of the shapes are almost archetypical in a sense that they
    can't really be any different because of the grid and general style, which might
    explain similarities with other typefaces in this style. Which is fine. And your
    design is different enough.\r\n\r\nAs for the 'm', I think the way you constructed
    the 'w' might give you some ideas.\r\nAnd I like the idea of putting the diacritics
    and accents inside the characters. \r\nI'll make a post with more comments on
    a later time, because I can't right now.\r\n\r\nOh, and on a sidenote, on page
    2 of your PDF, it says 'cumbitos'... ;)\r\n"

  body: "Thank you very much Jelmar.\r\n\r\nI've did some quickly changes -- I'm moving
    to another house, so the things are chaotic this weekend :-P --, take a look...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chumbitos_var1_6500.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    I think both can live together to, one more contrasted (original) and one more
    \"normal\" (with these possibilities). What do you think?\r\n\r\nundr"

  body: I like the broader terminals. I'm not sure about the diagonal cut-offs, although
    I also somehow like it at the same time. But I think this typeface could use some
    alternates anyway, so you can always supply some of them as alternates.

  body: "After some experimentation and many additions of unnecessary elements, I
    decided to back to basic and to the original intention of Chumbitos: The less
    as possible elements <em>over</em> a square to build a glyph. I did a full revision
    and I'm thinking in release only Chumbitos-Regular and Chumbitos-Bold, without
    any Alternates. I don't know why, but I think this typeface don't need it with
    all this ideas behind it...\r\n\r\nOn the Regular, I worked always with 10% of
    the square size for all the elements over the square. On the Bold one, I changed
    it to 20%, but it affects only some <em>vertical elements</em>, leaving all the
    others unchanged. So, the Bold version don't has all its glyphs different of the
    Regular, but it offers a considerable increase of weight on use...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fictilia.org/stuff/Chumbitos_070822a.pdf\"><strong>Here
    is a pdf</strong></a> to illustrate what I said.\r\n\r\nNow I think it needs just
    some little adjustments and it will be fine to go... ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nundr"
