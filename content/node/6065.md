  body: 'I was there just a couple of weeks ago scouting around for bookshops.  <BR>There&#39;s
    a concentration of bookshops around Leicester square tube station.  <BR>A lot
    are second hand shops, which are pretty much useless. There are also  <BR>a few
    good shops on Charing Cross Road, literally one minute&#39;s walk north  <BR>of
    Leicester Sq tube. There was one ... I can&#39;t remember its name ... but it
    had  <BR>a lot of stuff you can&#39;t usually find elsewhere, a lot of Hyphen
    Press stuff. It&#39;s  <BR>a good job I was short of cash, or I would have emptied
    my wallet. '

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>As Alex said the walk along Charing Cross Road,
    and from there to Covent Garden, has more art/photography bookstores than what
    a designer&#39;s salary can withstand. Enjoy! <BR> <BR>ps. also check out the
    Design Museum and Tate bookstores.

    selection of design books most of the time.

  body: The best second hand and antiquarian typography bookshop in London is Collinge
    &amp; Clarke on Leigh Street, north east of the British Museum and Russell Square.
    Definitely worth a visit. Just around the corner from them is Judd Books, which
    is a remainder shop that usually has some good stuff in their books-on-books section.

  body: Also, the bookshop at the British Library is excellent. It focuses on book
    typography rather than graphic design, but it has an excellent selection of scholarly
    books on type and printing history, many published by the BL. It is only a short
    walk north from Collinge &amp; Clarke.

    Road &#40;this used to be called Zwemmers, but is now called Shipley&#41;.
