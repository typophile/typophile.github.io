  Text</strong> is a reworking and extension of Panno (now renamed Panno Sign) and
  is optimised for continuous text. Similar to its signage counterpart it has narrow
  proportions, a very large x-height and open counters. The design of Panno can be
  characterised as simple and robust with little difference between its thickest and
  thinnest parts. Panno can serve as a perfect replacement for DIN in situations where
  the latter might feel too constructed or too cold. It will feel comfortable in many
  different environments whether that might be in editorial use, in corporate identities
  or in manuals.\r\n \r\nIn comparison to the signage version many shapes have been
  carefully adapted and the spacing has been completely reworked to assure excellent
  legibility in small sizes. Furthermore the family has been expanded into multiple
  weights and to complete the typographical palette each weigth comes with a proper
  italic as well. Every version sports an extended Latin character set and various
  OpenType features that give access to fractions, different styles of numbers and
  alternative versions of glyphs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Bold Monday</strong>\r\nhttp://www.boldmonday.com/en/pannotext/\r\nhttp://www.boldmonday.com/en/pannosign/\r\nhttp://www.boldmonday.com"
