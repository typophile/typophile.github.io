body: "Trying to ID this font, looks like \"Interstate black\" and \"Maquette\" had
  a baby....\r\n\r\nI've seen it around before I think most notably on a History Channel
  or National Geographic campaign in the NYC subways over the summer. Anyway the sample
  is here....\r\n\r\n[[http://www.plu.edu/~trullcw/img/newtype.jpg]]\r\n\r\nIt's the
  \"GUYVER\" text in the foreground.\r\n\r\nHere's another with some lowercase characters...\r\n[[http://www.scifijapan.com/news%20bites/NTUSA04a.jpg]]\r\n\r\nIt's
  \"Le Chevalier D' Eon\" in the foreground.\r\n\r\nI'm probably just blanking out,
  I have a few so similar. Any help would be appreciated.-C."
