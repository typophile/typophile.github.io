  then please direct me to the relevant thread, but I am shortly intending on buying
  a new laser printer (mono) and was wondering whether I should be looking for a really
  high DPI or LPA? Or are the two impossible to separate (i.e. you cannot have a low
  DPI and a high LPI)?\r\n\r\nI am currently thinking of the <strong>HP LaserJet P2055d</strong>
  which has 1200\xD71200dpi? Is a Postscript printer I should be aiming at instead?
  Mostly my work involves rather long technical reports and environmental reports
  but I wouldn't want to short-change myself too much on quality. I haven't got a
  massive budget on this so this seems quite a good deal.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or tips
  would be appreciated."

    of print quality. Though there are other factors.\r\n\r\nThese days, PostScript
    is not a necessity, especially if you are primarily printing reports. Your HP
    does have PostScript emulation, which is a third-party clone of PostScript, in
    the event you need it. For your usage, I don't see any major advantage for having
    Adobe PostScript.\r\n"

  body: "The <strong>short answer</strong> is: Don't worry about it. Pay attention
    to the above previous post. I would contend that LPI is more a concern for a designer
    using an offset printer\u2014yet not as much as in days past; I'll explain why
    in the second paragraph. HP seems to be good about publishing its LPI and it can
    be useful to know in certain cases. But for a personal printer or proofing device,
    it's not as much of a concern. Especially if you are personally equipped with
    a large hard drive and lots of RAM pushing your file to your personal printer.
    The <strong>long answer</strong> is as follows: Knowing LPI used to be a detail
    that was much more of an issue prior to enormous storage sizes of digital media;
    think Iomega ZIP disk days. It's really a simple answer of what sort of file resolution
    you want to print and does the LPI on the printer allow for such a resolution?
    To add one more acronym, LPI has much more to do with PPI (pixels per inch) of
    the digital file you are saving. In other words what is the resolution your Photoshop
    (PSD, TIFF or EPS) file?\r\n\r\nLet's forget the subject of your HP printer for
    a second and let's talk the foundation of the issue of LPI. There is a formula
    to use if you know the LPI output of the device (whether it's old school film
    or large format digital Epson or HP or even offset poly-plate) so the designer
    can plan the most optimal PPI for their files. This is particularly important
    if you have a huge newsletter or magazine with tons of photos. Example: lets assume
    an offset printer has an LPI of 150. (it's possible that it may print 2400 DPI
    or even more, but that is not the point right now.) <em>The formula is as follows;</em><strong>
    125% of the LPI of the printer device (or film/plate) is the absolute minimum
    to figure the resolution for PPI. </strong>\r\n\r\nLet's try that; say you have
    a printer with 150 LPI. That means a minimum (Photoshop) file resolution size
    at 189 PPI. Yes, 189 PPI. I know that seems low but it works as the minimum size
    principle. It of course can be higher but that is the absolute minimum for 150
    LPI and <em>not</em> get bitmapped jagged edges on photos or artwork.  I've been
    doing this long enough to remember the days of 44MB SyQuest disk or Iomega Bernoulli
    media to know what I'm talking about and how to optimize file sizes. \r\n\r\nEver
    wonder where the 300 PPI file standard came from? Back then, (1992ish) when we
    had to figure out digital file sizes, we didn't like doing the math.  Instead,
    we would double the percentage of a typical high resolution file that was being
    printed on a 6-fountain offset printer, (150 LPI to 300 PPI) and that would cover
    our bases. One more example: In the days before digital offset, some films were
    even output at 133 LPI (or lower) when they were printed on uncoated paper. The
    file resolution for 133 LPI was 167 PPI. \r\n\r\nNow, back to your HP printer
    LPI concern. If you know the LPI, you know what the minimum file PPI size needed
    to print great looking artwork on the printer. The two most important advantages
    of knowing the minimum optimum resolution is: 1. getting the most out of your
    storage media or 2. when the file is being rendered for print. For instance, a
    file with two hundred good-sized TIFF images at 188 PPI is a much smaller file
    than the same two hundred TIFF images at 300 PPI! Both will print identical looking
    files. It not only saves storage media but when you RIP the file to the printer,
    it also takes much less time to print no mater how fast your computer is. LPI,
    DPI, PPI, whew, that's way too much info for one post but there you have it.\r\n\r\nTom

  body: Thank you everyone, especially to <strong>wreckedangles</strong> for a highly
    informative answer / mini-lecture, very much appreciated. I note that someone
    else has also posted a thread about what printer purchase to make so I will read
    that, armed with my new knowledge of DPI, PPI and LPI!
