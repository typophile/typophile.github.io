  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My company is sending myself and other Mac users on a two day course next month to learn about [[Adobe InDesign]]. Specifically, whether it is worth changing the whole (advertising) company from [[Quark 4]] to InDesign as opposed to upgrading Quark (the more expensive option).

Although I am a bit wary about changing over, I'll be going along with a (relatively) open mind. But I would like to know what thoughts do you people have about the differences between [[QuarkXpress|Quark]] and InDesign? Things to look out for? Basic boxes or tricky typographic twiddling? From an overall design perspective to a more particular typographic viewpoint -  which is best?

Apologies if this has been covered before, but it would be really useful to have a few opinions and perhaps things to look out for from people who know their stuff.

Thanks</div>

Quark though, rested on its laurels way too long. When they finally got to OS X it was way too late and without any compelling reasons to go back.

		<div class="commentbody">Heh. I must say, I&#39;m happily surprised to see that somebody considers Quark to be the underdog at this point. <BR> <BR>Of course, Quark was unchallenged in their market segment for quite a few years, and their development really stagnated. But even  <BR>if one thought that InDesign&#39;s market share could end up as strong as that for Photoshop, do people think that&#39;s bad? Has having the largest market share for high end image editing hurt the development of Photoshop? <BR> <BR>How do people feel about using apps from a bunch of different vendors? Is there anybody who used to use the Photoshop/Freehand/QuarkXPress combo who has moved to Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign who can comment on how much of a plus there is from app integration, versus folks concerns about having one vendor providing multiple apps? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rob: <BR>I use InDesign 2 &#40;on Windows&#41; at work &#40;a major Canadian Public Library&#41; and I enjoy it and it works well, smoothly, and is wonderful at setting text. I just like it. If you are already using Illustrator and Photoshop, InDesign makes an excellent fit. <BR> <BR>There are some interface inconsistencies with Illustrator and Photoshop, and that can bug you, but in all they are very nice together. <BR> <BR>I have purchased Creative Suite Premium for my own use &#40;on Macintosh&#41; and the integration is better through-out though there is still more to be done. It is pretty well wholesome and delicious from my POV. <BR> <BR>Thomas: <BR>I can&#39;t speak to crossing the Quark with Adobe apps. I have only ever used Adobe apps. I even liked Pagemaker and thanks for bringing back the Control Panel in CS. <BR> <BR>It looks like Macromedia Studio MX is in my very near future because of my various capacities at work, so I may be able to comment on this soon. <BR> <BR>Nick: <BR>What I don&#39;t understand is why you feel embarrased that your students haven&#39;t learned Quark. InD is clearly gaining traction and improving steadily, and seems the way of the future. Your students are well prepared. I don&#39;t understand why employers and potential employees both worry so much about whether you have one or the other. Can&#39;t the other be learned and conceptually we&#39;re talking about the same stuff right &#40;text and pictures combined on a page&#41;, so you sit down, RTFM, screw around, commit to using the new one for a critical project and then you&#39;ve got a pretty good idea of what goes on. I know this sounds like I&#39;m an arrogant prick &#40;I can be&#41; but what I&#39;m getting at is: are these programs that conceptually different? From what I have seen in the screenshots and movies and stuff it looks a lot the same.&#42; <BR> <BR>In general: <BR>I have never had the opportunity to use Quark. I&#39;m sure it can be learned. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a very capable program or the large number of companies that do use it would no longer be invested in it. <BR> <BR>As a potential customer &#40;and up until my recent CS purchase I was one&#41;, nothing that Quark did or said could convince me that their world was better. Truthfully I must say that their insistence on not bringing their stuff to OS X drove me mad and predjudiced me against them forever. <BR> <BR>Jon <BR> <BR>&#42;I remember now: their Flash movie seems to not work when you get to the Landmarks section. I&#39;m downloading a demo of Quark right now just to prove to myself what a reasonable guy I am...</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><b>Grant,</b> I was referring to Nick&#39;s disappointment that OT implementation in InDesign is botched &#40;Nick&#39;s words, not mine&#41;. I only say InDesign is pioneering, because it&#39;s the only mainstream app that can use OT fonts at the moment. <BR> <BR><b>Nick,</b> there are color swatches in InD. They just happen to be in the color palette. &#40;Imagine that.&#41; Rather than in an obscure dialogue box. I agree with Jon, that is one aspect of the Adobe suite that&#39;s really nice - the apps all play nicely together. For the most part all the key commands are the same. <BR> <BR><b>Thomas,</b> of course Quark is the underdog. They&#39;re not Microsoft or Adobe. =&#41; It was easy to predict the day Adobe announced InDesign &#40;1998?&#41;. I knew then PageMaker and Quark were doomed if Adobe got InD right. &#40;Frankly I was kind of puzzled to see PageMaker continue on for so long after InD came out.&#41; <BR> <BR>Furthermore, you&#39;re right about the Photoshop example. I&#39;ve been impressed that Adobe has continued to innovate with Photoshop. &#40;Afterall, they still want people to have a good reason to upgrade every year or two, right? No different from any other software maker.&#41; <BR> <BR><b>Rob Walker,</b> one final point. Don&#39;t expect to install InDesign and &#34;get it&#34; immediately. If you know Illustrator, sitting in the InD saddle will feel very familiar. But when you switch, give yourself some adequate time to try stuff, read the manual, etc. For me it took half a day to get over the awkwardness of a new app and about a full week before I felt like I really understood the more complex stuff: how to use masks, masterpages, style sheets, etc. <BR> <BR>I guess the bottom line is, I don&#39;t believe in hanging on to old tech for nostalgia&#39;s sake. For utility&#39;s sake, yes. Just don&#39;t expect to see me with a Newton. =&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas asked: <i> ... who has moved to Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign who can comment on how much of a plus there is from app integration, versus folks concerns about having one vendor providing multiple apps?</i> <BR> <BR>I can comment on this. Although I&#39;m far from expert, I have to say that is one really major reason I&#39;m trying to work with only InDesign and not going back to Quark. The fact that everything seems to be one application. The ability to go back and forth without having to mentally switch different quick keys. The downside for me is speed. I&#39;m using Panther and Indy CS &#40;all CS now actually&#41;. But Quark is still faster, and not just marginally, I would call indy slug-like even. But, I use Indy because the patience pays off in the end. --- BTW Indy &#62; GoLive &#60; Illustrator is pretty cool too.  <BR> <BR>Nick said: <i>EMBARRASSMENT that my students &#40;I teach part time&#41; will graduate proficient in InD, but with no Quark skills &#40;the faculty chose Adobe&#41;, when that&#39;s a requirement of most entry-level jobs</i> <BR> <BR>This is a reality. I can relate to this. It seems most entry level jobs want friggin&#39; ambidextrous multi-lingual multi-platform multi-media geniuses ... an unfair amount of pressure is put upon the teachers whose hands are tied.  <BR> <BR>I can also say that I have put zillions of hours into Quark and can only say that I&#39;m happy that Adobe allows the quick-keys &#40;and other such&#41; to be the same app to app. I can even set my palettes up almost identically from app to app. Lurvely! <BR> <BR>Up until recently I&#39;ve managed to leave Quark alone. I do have a two clients now, one a publisher the other in the training field, who both use Quark 4.11 -- so I happily can help them. Otherwise I might not have been able to accept the work. I consider Quark a tool that I can use when I need to, but only often enough that it doesn&#39;t get dusty. However, if more clients need me to use Quark I won&#39;t turn my nose up at them. Quark isn&#39;t a way of life, it is only a tool to me. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">rob, <BR> <BR>I believe that stitching is an on-screen side effect of the &#34;smooth line art&#34; setting. If you turn it off &#40;or is it on?&#41; it should go away. It may or may not be worth it to lose the anti-aliasing. Adobe is aware of this issue, though it turns out to be really difficult to eliminate in all possible situations. <BR> <BR>Joe, <BR> <BR>You write: <BR> <BR><i>I only say InDesign is pioneering, because it&#39;s the only mainstream app that can use OT fonts at the moment</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure you and most of the people in this thread know what you actually meant, but just for the benefit of any lurkers, I should say: <BR> <BR>- there are very few apps that have shipped in the last five years or so that do not work pretty well with OpenType fonts. However, many publishing and graphics applications don&#39;t speak Unicode &#40;and therefore can&#39;t use any extended language support, if present in the font&#41;, and/or don&#39;t support OpenType layout features &#40;and therefore can&#39;t get at added typographic goodies in the font, such as built-in small caps, more ligatures, whatever&#41;. <BR> <BR>- Besides InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop are both fairly fluent in Unicode and OpenType layout. Premiere and AfterEffects both speak Unicode, too. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joe: re the colors -- there really were no Pantone colors anywhere in InDesign 2.0! This bug was fixed with 2.1.  <BR> <BR>Grant: re &#34;OT botched&#34; in InD, there are several problems. To begin with, the OT commands are buried on a 2nd-level submenu. It would be nice to have an interface which showed the user at a glance what features were available for a particular font -- Basic, Faux, or OT -- and allowed one to select a piece of text and just click on buttons to see the effect, rather than &#34;click-drag-drag-release&#34; every time. Secondly, the major issue of &#34;is it or isn&#39;t it&#34; faux small caps is not resolved. Ultimately, OT features should not be in an add-on menu, but integrated. It&#39;s unfortunate that they were not a more integral part of the InDesign coding from its inception, because the timing was concurrent. <BR> <BR>The OT palette is a work in progress, and is more progressed in Illustrator CS than in InDesign CS. And I am PLEASED that it&#39;s getting better all the time! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I see nasty notchy blocks of justified copy, I shiver and think of the days before I had the paragraph composer. I get angry about dongles. Even worse: one undo. I hated Quark every minute I used it &#40;starting in 1994&#41;. When InD came out I bought the first copy. When my OS9 machine crashed &#40;we all remember those days&#41;, I was amazed to find the project I was working on happily waiting for me when I re-opened InDesign. It was slow, but in that moment I was sold. <BR> <BR>I do use multiple graphics platforms. For web work, I use the macromedia suite &#40;photoshop for the web? yuck&#41; and BBEdit. I rarely mix the two suites, however. I still have a soft spot in my heart for Deneba Canvas &#40;bet you never heard of it&#41;. It&#39;s a do-everything graphics app that my Dad bought me when I was a kid &#40;mostly because it was so cheap&#41;. I acutally used it my first year of design school, because it&#39;s all I could afford. Now it&#39;s marketed to engineers. <BR> <BR>As for competition for Photoshop: how do we know how good photoshop would be if it had some serious competition? Maybe it would be faster, or have new features we haven&#39;t thought of; maybe it wouldn&#39;t cost so much. I love Photoshop, but I wish it had some friendly competition. <BR> <BR>As for botched OpenType support: I&#39;ve talked about this before, but why should supported features be defined by the application? Why shouldn&#39;t they be defined by the type designer? For example, why can&#39;t I add four different ligature sets to a font. Why do I have to put them in the &#34;titling alternates&#34; feature, just so I can access them? It&#39;s times like this that I&#39;m saddened at Apple&#39;s lousy job of promoting AAT, and that I&#39;ll probably never see AAT features supported in Adobe apps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I actually agree with Christian on competition. I actually hope that the InDesign/QuarkXPress rivalry lasts a good long while. Both applications will benefit, as will end users. Except for people who have to do output and stuff, who will have to know and use both apps where they otherwise would only have to deal with one. <BR> <BR>&#62; why should supported features be defined by the application? <BR> <BR>Because that&#39;s the only way for the application to know what&#39;s going on in the line of text. And such knowledge is important for a number of things, including... multi-line composition. I had a discussion with some of the Apple folks about it once, and we agreed that it would not be possible for an app to do multi-line composition and also use the GX/AAT Line Layout Manager. <BR> <BR>Maybe the recent changes in the AAT architecture will have fixed this situation. I&#39;ll have to ask some time. <BR> <BR>&#62; Why do I have to put them in the &#34;titling alternates&#34; feature, just so I can access them? <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice by making messed-up features, but I understand the impulse. I certainly agree that it&#39;s frustrating that not all OT features are supported by the existing OT savvy apps. And I can understand the designer&#39;s desire for arbitrary features. <BR> <BR>&#62; I&#39;ll probably never see AAT features supported in Adobe apps <BR> <BR>I feel pretty safe saying &#34;never&#34; on that proposition. Apple chose to back a single-platform horse and refused to open it up. They dug their own grave on this score. <BR> <BR>Have you ever done any significant feature programming in AAT? Programming them thar state machines is quite a pain. &#40;But at least the performance is acceptable on early 90s hardware.&#41; <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

It&#39;s just so simple and beautiful to turn on one character, without having to install an entirely new font. What&#39;s more, with features that aren&#39;t mutually exclusive, you could conceivably have tons of different combinations with just a few features. In the mean time I will have to make different combinations myself and package them as different fonts, instead of leaving the combinations up to the type setter, which is what I&#39;d rather do. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#62;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; In fact, I would say that a comprehensive set of alternate ligatures does qualify as a separate style. <BR> <BR>Certainly it&#39;s distinct. But a comprehensive set of small caps is also a separate style. Really, the whole dividing line between styling within a font and separate fonts in a family is mostly pretty arbitrary. <BR> <BR>&#62; There&#39;s nothing to stop type designers circumventing the InD set-up, by creating an OT &#34;small cap&#34; font with SC glyphs encoded to the standard character. Just like the way Type1 and TrueType SC fonts work.  <BR> <BR>Sure! That doesn&#39;t do much fundamental damage to the underlying text storage. Having fonts where ligatures are encoded as VWXYZ and the like, though, that&#39;s a real problem. <BR> <BR>&#62; A putative OT Mrs Eaves, with the two sizes of small caps, would have to take that route, although your idea that the two SC options should appear in the features menu makes more sense. <BR> <BR>Urm. Mrs Eaves has been shipping in OpenType format for quite a while now &#40;a year or more I think&#41;. There is an OT feature called &#34;petite caps&#34; that specifically allows a second set of different-sized small caps. <BR> <BR>These days, for arbitrary stuff like this, one probably ought to put it in the &#34;stylistic sets&#34; features. Leastways, that&#39;s how I&#39;d do it. It would be a relatively short-term workaround to put them in separate fonts, and has disadvantages as Christian says. <BR> <BR>Christian wrote: <BR> <BR>&#62;  &#34;Significant&#34; programming is a pain no matter what you&#39;re working on, though. <BR> <BR>Mmmm. Well, sort of. You can do contextual stuff pretty easily in OpenType, while it is reportedly quite a challenge in AAT. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course, this is only an option. By default, InD uses the kerning built into the font. Personally, I&#39;d use optical kerning on almost any shareware font, and some retail fonts. When it comes to really well made fonts, I still use it for unusual letter or symbol combos that are unkerned, or other special situations. It saves me taking the time to kern the combination manually, and usually comes out with about the same result. <BR> <BR>Hrant will swear that optical kerning does a better job than all but the very best type designers.

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;d go even further, Thomas, with my reservations about optical kerning. <BR> <BR>Unless a typographer takes the time to actually compare the effects of Optical Kerning on different kinds of fonts, he/she won&#39;t know whether it will improve, leave unaffected, or make worse the spacing. <BR> <BR>As an example of where it makes things worse, consider good old Times. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/35812.jpg" alt="albowni"> <BR> <BR>In the top sample, there is no kerning. <BR>Below, optical kerning. &#40;I have adjusted the tracking so that word lengths match, as Optical Kerning is equivalent to about minus-15 of tracking with this face.&#41; <BR> <BR>You can see that optical kerning has added space between a-l, and removed it between l-b, making the rhythm of vertical strokes in those first three characters uneven, <BR> <BR>Between &#34;o-w-n&#34; it has effectively moved the w to the left, again making an uneven distribution of the heavier strokes. So, it looks like the algorithms, concenred with &#34;negative&#34; spaces don&#39;t &#34;see&#34; the overall impression of a rhythm of dominant strokes which a typeface makes. <BR> <BR>The character shapes and the sidebearing widths of typefaces such as Times were specifically designed NOT to be kerned. Only in the &#34;impossible&#34; character combinations, such as T,V,W,Y followed by a round lower-case characters, were kerns made, for instance by the Linotype machine, with &#34;Two-Letter Logotypes&#34;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; <BR> <BR>In my experience, InD optical is best used sparingly. Aside from the=20 performance issues, I agree with Nick that it more often mucks things=20 up when you start with a well spaced font. Even with a poorly spaced=20 font, InD can only help so much. I used to set preliminary text samples=20= <BR> <BR>in a font, to get an idea about which characters needed to change=20 before I spaced it properly. I found that InD optical only &#42;influences&#42;=20= <BR> <BR>the spacing, as opposed to replacing it as Hrant suggests. So if you=20 have a poorly spaced font to begin with &#40;e.g. ScanFont&#39;s auto-spacing&#41;,=20= <BR> <BR>InD can only go so far to make things better--though it can improve=20 things. I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s more useful for titling since so many=20 fonts are spaced for 12pt: even titling fonts. The optical size=20 compensations are definitely cool. <BR> <BR>&#62;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I&#39;m doing all the work here!  <BR> <BR>My argument is made with visual examples and testing, rather than theories about immersive reading and the way optical kerning works. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s see some visual proof, in one-on-one testing, of the superiority of Optical Kerning. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve made some refinements to refute your criticism. I&#39;ve made this sample from 9 pt. type. Then I blurred it, to highlight the rhythm of dominant strokes, and the broad shapes of inter-character spaces. <BR> <BR>By bunching up &#34;lbow&#34;, optical kerning has worsened the spacing here. Perhaps it&#39;s an anomaly, but this was the first character sequence I chose, off the top of my head, because it has some difficult combinations that I often use in the type design process. <BR> <BR>Times: Above, no kerning. Below, Indy Optical Kerning.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/35930.jpg" alt="albowni2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;&#34;my theories&#34; <BR> <BR>Hey, you&#39;re the bouma guy. <BR> <BR>&#62;Two words &#40;one of them a non-word&#41; from one font is more than enough testing <BR> <BR>One word is not comprehensive enough to make a solid generalisation, but if optical kerning can&#39;t get &#34;and&#34; in Times Roman right.... <BR> <BR>Anyway, I checked out a few more good old serifed faces, and optical kerning does the same thing in all of them for the &#34;a&#34; -- adding extra space after, when a vertical stem is next.  <BR> <BR>That is really dysfunctional, because all the faces were designed so that the tail serif and sidebearing on the &#34;a&#34; provides both the appropriate &#34;breathing space&#34; and &#34;connectivity&#34; with following letters. <BR> <BR>The right sidebearing on trad serifed &#34;a&#34;s is less than for other characters with lower right serifs, because the top of the right side of the a is curved back, away from the following letter. this is why the serif curves up, to compensate, to make the letters appear more connected, yet without touching.  <BR> <BR>The right vertical stem of the &#34;a&#34; is designed to be a certain distance from following vertical stems; and the serif of the &#34;a&#34; is designed to be very close to serifs that follow, yet Optical Kerning looks at that minimum distance and won&#39;t allow it, thereby pushing the adjacent stems too far apart, creating uneven color. <BR>QED.</div>

But from what I&#39;ve seen &#40;previously and in this thread&#41;, it looks like it improves the <i>overall</i> spacing of <i>most</i> fonts. Maybe 90% is too much, but it still feels way above 75% to me. <BR> <BR>Plus the good news is that: <BR>1&#41; You can somewhat predict when you shouldn&#39;t use it &#40;based on the source of the font at hand&#41;. <BR>2&#41; For point sizes outside the original &#34;intended range&#34; it does much better than brute tracking. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
