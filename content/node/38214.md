  is the problem:  I'm working at a University department that does applied research
  and also publishes documents.  All in-house, and out of Microsoft Word.  Currently
  there is no usage of \"styles\" in word and thus a document can get passed from
  author to author in the final stages of writing, and one adjustment by someone can
  potentially create more work in re-\"styling\" things to some ambiguous undefinable
  format, but an eventual \"end product\".  So basically, font/headings/italics/locations
  of captions, etc etc are somehow decided at the end of the paper.  Without going
  further, it's a mess.  \r\n\r\nWhat actually gets printed is very minimal.  Maybe
  only 20 copies max, but many pages. (100-200 page reports)\r\n\r\nThe goal:  To
  be able to still use Word between authors to write a document and continue making
  adjustments without fear of destroying other's work in the process. \r\n\r\nTo throw
  another wrench into things: Cross Platform, this means Word 2007 and Word 2008 (for
  OSX), or at this time Word 2003 and Word 2004 (OS X).\r\n\r\nThings I have already
  done:\r\n1. Looked into using something other than Times New Roman, or Times on
  the Mac and placing it on every machine we use.  This is where style issues have
  occurred because it seems not everyone has the same font.  A designer that is helping
  \"rebrand\" this facility wants to use a Helvetica Neue and Sabon look to our papers.
  \ We own the Adobe CS3 package, so we now own Garamond Premier Pro (but only Reg/Ital/SemiBold/Semibold
  Ital comes in that family.)  So I suggested instead of Sabon, we use Garamond.  (If
  Sabon was required, I would promote Sabon Next instead.)\r\n\r\n2.  Worked on creating
  rules and styles within Word, so that changes in heading size and look are restricted
  to what the ultimate end style can use.  Thus no one can assign a font (accidentally
  or intentionally) to a \"Heading 2\" style, and when it gets sent somewhere that
  doesn't have that font, they can't mess up formatting of a document.\r\n\r\nSome
  questions/thoughts: As far as fonts go, within a family how many variations do we
  really need to publish a generic \"report\"?  Would you recommend getting caption
  faces?  Do the regular faces of Garamond not perform  well at smaller sizes?  What
  sizes? \r\n\r\nWhat if an author wants to send a doc for review outside of our internal
  group, do we have to worry about issues and changes in a file's look if it comes
  back edited?   I assume it makes more sense for the authors to simply track changes,
  and blend any changes into their original document.\r\n \r\nIs there anything else
  that we can consider to make publishing easier for everyone?  We are willing to
  do the work to get to that point, but we want to make it easier for authors in the
  end.  We don't want to turn authors into typesetters, but we want the look of their
  finished product to be of a good quality.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions at
  all, please let me know.  (I am aware Word stinks for publishing, save your stamp)."

  body: "Re your point #2, creating styles (or complete templates) in Word isn't going
    to solve the multiple editor/reviewer problem unless you can ensure that nobody
    will ever modify the styles -- which of course you can't. Worse, you can't stop
    people from creating new styles (unique to themselves) and formatting the document
    using their styles instead of yours. Even worse, any number of people can create
    wildly different styles that all have the same name. IIRC, what happens then is
    that when A sends a document to B and B returns an edited copy to A, any of B's
    styles that have the same name as A's override A's styles. And if either A or
    B copies stuff into the document from other sources, those source styles go along
    for the ride too (unless the copy is done with a Paste Special as unformatted
    text).\r\n\r\nThere are other problems not related to styles. For instance, you
    might find that B is using a French version of Word while A is using English (I've
    seen this happen even within the same company), and when one checks the other's
    spelling, typos go undiscovered.\r\n\r\nWord change tracking? Not too bad when
    the only changes are to text, but not so good  when formatting is involved.\r\n\r\nI've
    fought this battle for years, and the only solution is to have one person maintain
    a master document that is never touched by anybody else, with internal and external
    reviews done using commentable PDF files. These can be created by Adobe Professional
    7 or 8. "

  body: "I can only speak to small part of your question(s).\r\n\r\nI format LOTS
    of very long documents, often books well over 500 pages. For internal government
    documents - which in many ways are quite similar in terms of needs & audience
    to academic documents - I've found a very narrow style using simply:\r\n\r\nroman\r\nitalic\r\nsmall
    caps\r\n\r\nworks very well. No bolds or semibolds; I leave that to the heading
    type, where I use various weights and widths of a titling face like your Helv
    Neue or something similar depending on the grid, space, hierarchy, etc. Also,
    no underlines; in 99.9% of all cases, italics do what bolds and underlines would
    otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs far as the proofing / writing goes, you might want to look
    at using Google Docs for proofing - it will track changes, allowing you to retrace
    your steps at any point; it will tell you who did what; it will keep all styles
    consistent between platforms and machines, and it can be shared with an unlimited
    number of people. You can also restrict permissions, I think, so that some people
    can read and not make changes, or annotate only, etc.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how
    possible this might be, but I'd also suggest not even beginning ANY typesetting
    / design until after the last person involved in editing has signed off on the
    document and it's ready to go. While I'm all for cross-pollination, I think that
    the writing and editing stage of document creation MUST be completely finalized
    before typesetting even begins, as the smallest changes in length, formatting
    and general style will often completely negate tremendous amounts of typesetting
    labor.\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\nJoshua\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt : http://www.hewnandhammered.com"

  body: "The key thing in my experience is to educate your authors/editors to use
    styles as much as they can. Remember this not only keeps formatting consistent
    but, perhaps more importantly during the editing phase, also labels the hierarchy
    of each paragraph in the document. If you're concerned with authors editing style
    definitions (most won't know how, though), keep them in a master template and
    reapply this to the document when it comes back to you. Good practice (per Gus's
    point) to also scan for rogue styles in the doc and revert these to your master
    styles. Stick to built-in style names as far as you can.\r\n\r\nYou can make applying
    styles more convenient by adding them to a custom toolbar, menu or keyboard shortcuts,
    rather than having to hunt through the Style Pane (which never seems to show you
    just the styles you want to use). You can also use macros to automate processes
    such as style cleanup, for example.\r\n\r\nRemember that Word has a few odd habits
    - the document will be reformatted automatically for the current printer - this
    can mean that the same document has slightly different effective margins when
    seen on different systems, and page breaks can move. You can mitigate to some
    extent by using \"page break before\" on paragraphs rather than manual page breaks,
    but I wouldn't worry about it too much and accept there will be some fine tuning
    at the end.\r\n\r\nIt's not really too difficult to manage. You might be surprised
    just how much Word is used for publishing by financial firms, for example."

  body: "To further this... The reason we want to stick with word, and the reason
    we can't have it all flow through an editor all the time, is that the authors
    are (self-admitidly) lazy in attacking the report before it's due.  They write
    and edit and write up to the point before their deadline, and want to fire it
    off from their desks.\r\n\r\nIt may seem weird, but it is how it is done."

    up to print deadline and analysts, editors, publishers and legal advisers all
    need to be able to work on the doc until that point. And believe me they don't
    want to learn InDesign...\r\n\r\nOne key issue I forgot to mention was that Word
    will output RGB files -- so either you or your printers' prepress dept may need
    to use something like Pitstop Pro to convert to print colours. You can automate
    this so it's a one-click process."

  body: If you have Word 2003 or 2007, you can lock the styles (see [[http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10877_11-5884344.html|this]]
    article). However, it appears that it doesn't work with earlier versions of Word,
    so those users could mess up your document. I'm still using Word 2002, so I don't
    know about any other unexpected side effects.
