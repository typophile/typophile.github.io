  but I'm wondering... how do you avoid or double check that the logo your creating
  hasn't already been created or isn't too similar?\r\n\r\nI'm currently working freelance
  on a few logos and now I'm paranoid that there's possibly similar logos.. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "I came across [[http://www.logodesignlove.com/similar-original-logos|this
    article]] not too long ago that you might find interesting. Looking at the examples
    of similar logos, you can see how some are too close for comfort, and some aren't.
    For example, I think the Sun Microsystems diamond very clearly has the word \"Sun\"
    in it, and the Columbia Sportswear is doing its own thing. To me, they are different
    enough. But someone is always going to think your logo is similar to someone else's,
    so why worry about it? As long as you aren't actually ripping someone off (especially
    [[http://www.davidairey.com/the-worlds-best-logo-designers/|these guys]]), and
    have good reasons for the design choices you make, you should feel confident that
    your logo is unique enough.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jackson does make an excellent point
    about checking out the competition. If the Sun/Columbia companies were in the
    same industry, THEN I might think twice about their logos. \r\n\r\nI have a vague
    memory of a site filled with well-known logos, but I can't find it now. Perhaps
    it was just something I dreamed up. "

  body: "A logo that manages to capture some of the essence of a company/organisation
    can\u2019t be wrong, similar or not. Since this is so very, very hard to achieve,
    stumbling upon a look-alike may evoke the notion that your own design is too random.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, researching the clients competitive landscape is mandatory. Doing it too
    early in the process can obstruct the basic approach, though. Better to throw
    out all your favorite sketches later."
