  Is there a way to get it done?\r\nAs far as I get it embeds in PowerPoint (Office
  2003 and 2007) but no way to get it embedded in Word (2003 nor 2007).\r\nFontValidator
  doesn't report any critical error.\r\nI could follow a topic in this forum about
  this issue but there wasn't any final solution-conclusion.\r\n\r\nAnybody had these
  problems and have any light for the path to solve them?\r\nMany thanks for your
  help,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoancarles, BaseLab"
