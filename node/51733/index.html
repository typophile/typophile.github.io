David and Raphael say not. Israel says yes. John Hudson thinks maybe. William just thinks. :) Davis starting to think yes, too.

Is there any different between a kamatz katan, a chataf kamatz, and a chataf kamatz katan?

Raphael says no. Israel says yes. Prof. Dotan wonders. David didn't comment.

		<div class="commentbody">Raphael: <cite>Yes, but that is my point. With the furtive patach, you can encode it (if people actually want it is another question), but I still don’t see how you are going to even encode the kamatz katan. Even with our siddur we have made editorial decisions as to what is a kamatz katan or not based on various sources and changed our minds. How are you going to allow a person what to do?

I always cite the easy example of the Hebrew word for afternoon which the first kamatz is katan according to sefardim and gadol according to ashkenazim (and that’s an easy one). You have yet to address this problem.</cite>


gohebrew: <cite>I would make all the different forms of kamataz katan. People can chose which glyph they want.

Chocalate for chocalate lovers; vanilla for vanilla lovers; and even strawberry for those daring type.

If a GSUB routine can be written whereby ordinary kamatzes will be selectively replaced with one form of kataz katan, then so it shall be.

I then make three nearly identical versions of the font, each with a different default. If you pay extra, you get chocalate. If you pay extra, you get vanilla.

About kamatz katan for Ashkenazim, I was told by Israel-based kollel Hemdat HaAretz (the halachic decider for the OU) that even for them it is an issue, just not in recognizable pronunciation.

I think they mean on how it impacts the shva-na.</cite>

You can NOT do that till you'll solve ( I don't know how) the whole Halakha thing. Here's something new: The Yemenite tradition.

1. putting a football over a Hebrew letter isn't very typographically aesthetic imho
2. the chirik under the first lamed is too far to the firght.
3. the shva doesn't sit correctly under the resh.
4. The kadma over the nun needs to move to the left.
5. the mercha under the chaf is too far to the right.
6. The lower nikud in general are too close to the letters.
7. the lower taamim have been lowered for some reason. It looks odd to me.
8. The font needs to be kerned a little better. The vav and nun need to be closer together for example.

You are a very good typesetter, sensitive to the nuances in the example.

I simply pointed out to you a grammatical issue: placement of a shvana symbol in Biblical text.

Although the SLM typesetter was lacking, the custom font used has the nikkudot at the hieght of three levels, then the group of lower taamim at the middle horizontal height and finally the meteg starts from the lowest vertical height.

Does Koren use this three leveled system?

Firstly, I don't understand why the meteg is different from the other taamim.

Secondly the position of the taamim in Koren is according to each taam but in principle it's not lower from the nikud and I am confused as to why to employ such a system.

The taamim are tertiary to the nikud and therefore they are often designed to be lighter than the nikud as in Koren, but why should they go off the baseline?

Sorry for being confused. I thought this was a typography forum not a grammar forum. I apologise for thinking that's why you posted it here.

But then again, I'm still confused, why are you showing this awful bit of typesetting on such a forum?</div>

So you hold that there are only nikkudot, which do not include metteg, and taamim, which do include metteg.

Though the function of metteg with nikudot is different than metteg with taamim.

Athough the metteg's graphical form is the same, their grammatical function differs.

You also think that Shai Lemora's symbol for shvana looks like a football.
Do you think Kehot's small asterish looks like a hotdog, or is OK?
Does ArtScroll's rafe-like horizontal line look like a pickle? Sometimes over a vov or even a gimmel it is wider than them, like a deflated blimp.
Do you really think bolding and/or enlargening the shva is better? At least, it only looks like an overweight shva.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">personally I think the asterisk is also very tacky but not as tacky as a football.

Artscroll's use of a rafe is better although of course incorrect since a rafe has a different meaning, but personally that doesn't bother me. The problem with the rafe is that it gets in the way of taamey mikra.

Making the shva larger is pretty ugly, however it became popular after making the kamatz katan larger too. It works graphically much better than a football or an asterisk.

If there are no taamim, then a rafe also works graphically because a horizontal line fits with the letters (eg a patach).

Regarding the meteg. There is no meteg in nikud. However, traditionally just as Artscroll "incorrectly" use a rafe to indicate a shva na, the meteg was used "incorrectly" to indicate a mileil.

It's like Rinat Yisrael who use an ole to indicate a mileil on commonly mispronounced words or a zarka for milra. It doesn't turn the taamim into nikud!

Also you don't address the bizarre vertical placement of the taamim.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the use of a rafe horizontal bar is not proper, because letters have different widths, from narrow to wide.

If the rafe bar is one size fits all, over narrow letters its too wide, and over wide letters its too narrow.

Using a round symbol like an asterisk is suitable for different widths.

Your rejecting the Kehot asterisk or Shay Kemora's "football" ib favor of ArtScroll's rafe symbol, or the over emphasized extra bold shva is simply an issue of taam verayach - personal preference, with no logic. I like it this way; I don't like it the other way.

Such lack of logic and reason is not convincing at all.

For example, the elongated kamatz katan is hardly similar in bold emplasis like the highlighted shva. Are you a graphic artist? 

The one is weighted like the other nikkud, but shaped differently. The other is very very differently that any other nikkud, and draws way too much attention to itself.

The small asterisk doesn't fraw any extra attention. Furthermore, according to the Minchat Shai's definition of shvana, it never occurs when there is a upper taam in its place. I checked.

Now, this seems to imply that there is a relationship between thr tules of shvana and the taamim, even though we don't know what is yet.

I think Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefeld of Shay Lemora chose the football=like asterisk inside a circle to distinguish his Minchat Shai-based shvana symbol from Kehot's Rav Henna (Hanau)'s asterisk shvana symbol.

So, in conclusion, ArtScroll's rafe symbol is illogical while Kehot's asterisk symbol is not.

In my view as a professional graphic artist, there is nothing wrong with the current depiction of the kamatz katan.

Regarding the meteg's widespread usage in non-taamim text, "go fight city hall" if you think that it will change. It ain't gonna happen.</div>

okay, I see your logic, but then again, do you make the patach longer or shorter depending on the letter?

<cite>

</cite>

I gave my opinion. I gave my logic. Why is my logic lacking. You don't have to agree. That's okay. But I would point out that most siddurim that I've seen in Israel that mark the shva na do so by making it larger thus kind of creating a standard. The asterisk is normally used to indicate a note and therefore I find it somewhat disturbing in it's position. The football is just daft.

<cite>For example, the elongated kamatz katan is hardly similar in bold emplasis like the highlighted shva. Are you a graphic artist? </cite>

Isn't it? I think it is. Are you a typographer? typesetter? doctor? lawyer? I'm confused. Your thoughts are all over the place and I don't understand what you are saying.

<cite>The one is weighted like the other nikkud, but shaped differently. The other is very very differently that any other nikkud, and draws way too much attention to itself.</cite>

Huh? which one is what? Which one draws too much attention? please clarify this point because I think this is interesting.

<cite>The small asterisk doesn’t fraw any extra attention. Furthermore, according to the Minchat Shai’s definition of shvana, it never occurs when there is a upper taam in its place. I checked.
</cite>

Doesn't it? Who says? I personally find it extremely distracting. It's a personal thing.

<cite>Now, this seems to imply that there is a relationship between thr tules of shvana and the taamim, even though we don’t know what is yet.</cite>

huh? Again I'm lost. To what are you referring?

<cite>I think Rabbi Shmuel Yehuda Winefeld of Shay Lemora chose the football=like asterisk inside a circle to distinguish his Minchat Shai-based shvana symbol from Kehot’s Rav Henna (Hanau)’s asterisk shvana symbol.</cite>

why? if the asterisk was so good, why create yet another symbol? Did Chabad copyright the asterisk?

<cite>So, in conclusion, ArtScroll’s rafe symbol is illogical while Kehot’s asterisk symbol is not.</cite>

Hey, I got 100% in logic at University and I'm completely failing to see the logic of yours. Both symbols have other purposes. The asterisk is probably more well-known than that of the rafe. Also the rafe is actually a taam whereas the asterisk has no basis in Bible typography. I think according to that logic, the rafe is far superior choice than that of an asterisk. But that's just my logic.

<cite>In my view as a professional graphic artist, there is nothing wrong with the current depiction of the kamatz katan.</cite>

Thank G-d. I will inform typesetters all over the world that we have Scott's approval on the symbol that has been used now in hundreds of thousands of siddur world-wide for over 50 years. People will be so relieved.

<cite>Regarding the meteg’s widespread usage in non-taamim text, “go fight city hall” if you think that it will change. It ain’t gonna happen.</cite>

Huh? What are you talking about. I have no objection to the meteg being used at all. I had it added to the new Koren Siddur that I produced. I think it's an excellent way of indicated mileil. Why would I "fight city hall".

I just pointed out that it isn't a nikud. The same way that the zarka and ole that is used by Rinat Yisrael are not nikud either. They are taamey mikra. They are used "incorrectly" in both instances, but who cares. They solve a problem very nicely.

2. every week or two you're changing your questions. now is "above the same letter".  well, not just sheva but also chataf (with lower or upper taam); because they can't "hold","carry"  the melody. but this is 100% pure cantillation grammar, and no point to talk about that right now.

I only appear to be saying:

1. Poetic license: not be taken literally. (I was quoting Shirley Temple. Anyway, it's not "no never" but: "no, no, never" - it's a triple nagative: still negative!)

2. hmmm. From day one, I'm suggesting this (<cite><strong>"A shvana symbol never occus above a letter that has an upper taam"</strong>, never!</cite>).
Currently, I'm weak in "cantillation grammar" and its melody. But, watch out, David.

3. Evidence is from Shay Lemora's relatively recent chumash, which R' Winefeld suggesats is based upon Minchat Shai's rules.

4. Only Winefeld is Chassidic, and wears a yellow frock coat on the Sabbath; he's yellow (and never served in the IDF, those chassidim. The others were in the IDF; they're not yellow.

		<div class="commentbody">David,

From studying patterns, I noticed that whenever the second letter was a shva, following a hei hayedi'ah, a hei with a patach, then the shva of the second letter was always na and not nach.

In your two examples, you see that too.

I posted other examples.


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/et_habracha_shvana_6263.jpg]


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samples_ha_shvana_4271.jpg]

I am certain that there is a different grammatical rule that these examples fall under.

But, remember, David, I am seeking to define context based rules. At first, Prof. Dotan got emotional, and insisted that this was impossible. Then, he though out it for a long time, and concluded it was possible.

When I asked R' Rabin in Toronto, he though long and hard about this, and concluded that it would take a lot of "sorting out", but it was in deed possible. But according Rav Henna (Hanau), it was most difficult, but was also possible.

I think the key lies in old Kehot prayerbook which provides over a thousand examples of Rav Henna's system, and Shay Lemora's books which provides over a thousand examples of Minchat Shai's system.

Where would I best read and analyze the significance of the seguence of the nikkud, and how one nikkud which precedes another nikkud 'influences' it. Where is the inter-relationship of different nikkud discussed?

In a different type of thought, we see that each taam has a dual function in (a) cantillation grammar and (b) melody. Where is it discussed the interelationship between these two factors and each kind of taam?

And where is each kind of taam appearing together with each kind of nikkud discussed?</div>

I'm a BT. If I thought only practical 'bout things, like money, I'd be in California some place, with more money to "piss off", and a few girl friends to... um.... hmmm.

But at age 22 or 23, I changed, and became a Chabadnik.

I gave up a scholarship at Spertus College (they thought I'd be the next Elie Wiesel), a gifted sports car, and a stipend to go out with girls every week. Plus I'd be invited for Shabbat every week by a dozen Conservatives. All they wanted in return to stay from those "stinky Lubavs".

Pretty good deal, huh?

But, I must have been really dumb. I picked those "stinky Lubavs". I ended going to yeshiva for years, getting married, having 8 kids, and the grandkids keep popping out...

I learned type design after a rav told me to stay away from safrut (because of my being left-handed, with strength in my right).

Now, I graduated to master OpenType thanks to Diane Collier and John Hudson. With a little more help from my friends (Rabbi Rabin, Prof. Dotan, David Hanuel, and others), I'll get this shvana, kamatz katan, meteg stuff mastered too (G-d made these things to figure out and master)...

Money is not my motivation. 

A person needs money to live. But living is not for money. It's only to make a living.

My goal is restore Jewish understanding of this grammar stuff to where it was before there were maskilim, and Jewish people began to lose knowledge of it, like today when 99.9% don't know the grammar of their own language.

I will spend less than a 1,000 hours researching it, and less than a hundred hours programming it. OpenType/Volt is brain intersive, not heavy in time consumtion - that's why I think you made a big mistake picking Tvika.)

My goal anyway is to earn money not from this mainly, but from other ventures, as seen as www.gotalmud.org and www.gohebrew.com.

<cite>[Btw, "harbs" disappointed me a great deal. You made him out to be really great, but he seems at best run of the mill - I would not buy anything from PrintIsrael. I see that www.fontworld.com is a much better source. Nothing Harbs claimed could be substantiated. Also, Kesofsky knows of your work and talents, and respects you highly.]</cite></div>

Re Tzvika. Why was he a mistake. He drew Koren perfectly. The font is stunning on screen and even more so when printed. Tzvika didn't program it in Volt, he just drew the font. I have my own programmer for the programming. 

Re Harbs. Sorry it didn't work out for you. He has been absolutely invaluable to my work and has given hundreds of hours of help to me as well as the few scripts that I've commissioned from him to make our Siddur and Tanakh projects work. He has come through for me time and time again.

We just launched the new Koren Siddur at the OU convention. It was very interesting. There must have 200-300 men on shul on shabbat. A lot of black hats. A lot of Rabbis from America. 

You know what? Despite the fact that they were using a siddur which had a shva na and a meteg (I'm ignoring the kamatz katan because this crowd didn't do Israeli pronunciation), the ba'aley tfilla who were a combination of prominent Rabbis and Chazanim still managed to mispronounce every word. Even the ba'al koreh was awful and not a single person corrected him.

All the siddurim put in a meteg, Artscroll has a very prominent line and some siddurim have footballs, yet nobody notices. I just wonder if literally millions of siddurim mark this already (some for over 100 years) but this has had no impact on the supposedly knowledgeable public...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just out of curiousity, Raphael, how were they "mispronouncing" the prayers? I put that in quotes because according to the essay by William Chomsky on the shva that came up in these discussions, it is very questionable whether the "correct pronunciation" was ever correct. He says that historically the current views on the correct places to pronounce the shva have their origin in the views of David Kimchi, also known as RaDaK. But if I read him rightly--and I am a novice at this--these were conjectural attempts to make sense of the Tiberian system of nikkud, and are of doubtful value. 

He says that within living memory both Ashkenazi and Sfaradi speakers of Hebrew have followed much simpler spoken rules. These have been: 1. Pronounce a shva if it is under a prepositional prefix or a conjunctive vav. 2. Pronounce it if it is under the first letter, and the first letter is a 'liquid consonant'--yod, mem, nun, lamed, and resh. 3. It is the second of two successive shvas. (I suppose the rule about two successive letters, eg hallelujah, applies also.)   

So, for example in k'tana and g'dola (little and big, feminine) the shva at the beginning is a shva nach, contrary to the 'right' rules which say that it is sounded. 

So if ignoring the supposed 'right' rules for the shva na is all they are doing 'wrong' my feeling is: "if this is wrong, I don't wanna be right", to paraphrase a country song. </div>

Although the OU has ascended in broad respectabilty among heredim in the USA, the ignorance about even basic issues is still widespread, evcen among those dress like heredim.

This only proofs the desperate need to increase awareness and educate.

I believe an automatic feature will increase awareness and educate. A teacher simply applies GHB FrankReuhl A to show before, and then GHB FrankReuhl B for after. Then, he or she explains the difference. 

I believe in a generation or two, things will improve.</div>

Also, regarding the "fact" that a taam never falls on a shva na. Well the tlisha ktana, being a prepositive taam will fall on it regularly whenever you have a word which starts with a shva. Also you will face collision problems in many faces with a lamed shva combination.</div>

When the stress is on the first syllable, you're going to see only one telishah (short words-- two letters); when the stress is on the second syllable (red arrow), then a second telishah gedolah is above the accented letter. However, this is an aid; to help the reader;  
 there's always a second telisha with any word with sheva na, or chataf; that said, sheva na, or chataf can't "hold" the melody.

You are correct that most people don't indicate the shva na at the beginning of the word and for that reason you were convinced that the shva at the beginning of the word is a shva nach!

In Koren, you will be pleased to know, we indicate the shva na at the beginning of the word.

I don't know if I accept your comment of:

<cite>Most everybody places a graphic symbol over a shvana in the middle of a word. </cite>

I am pretty sure that if I went into a Jewish Book shop in the neighbourhood, I'll find ten times more siddurim with a larger shva as a shva na than a rafe or football on top. Heck, I don't even have to leave the office... my boss has a nice collection of siddurim and... yep they all have larger shvas. No footballs, no rafes, no stars.

Yes Artscroll puts a rafe. Chabad puts stars or footballs (don't remember which was which), but that's really a minority when you come to Israel.</div>

Perhaps his view that spoken Hebrew is really more accurate is irrelevant for siddurim because there is a tradition since 12th century of influence the views of Kimchi, which would put the shva na where Chomsky would not.

I'm certainly no expert, but what our Rabbinical Grammarians say is that the pronunciation of the Hebrew in the siddur should reflect the period that the prayer was said. So for example, in Koren, the priestly blessing is Ye-va-rekh-kha (ie shva nach on 3rd syllable) and not Ye-va-re-khe-kha (ie shva na) as is in siddurim such as the Artscroll.


Unfortunately I have the luxury of an extremely professional staff whom I trust implicity and therefore don't have to learn too much grammar (I just ask them what to put where :-) ) so I don't really know much more than this.

That doesn't sound very professional I know, but I can certainly tell you how much I kerned the nun and yud :-)</div>

Which font design is this? Are you the designer?

It is both traditional judging from many design aspects, but it is also modern, because of different design aspects.

Shall I elaborate?

Usually, Biblical text is set in very traditional designs, like Vilna, Koren, or Hadasa (semi-modern). Rarely, is Biblical text set where the stroke width is uniform, as in the sample.

In a sense a uniform stroke width allows greater readability, like the advantages of sans-serif designs, such as Hevetica, versus serif designs, such as Times-Roman, but in my opinion non-uniform stroke widths allow the design greater creativity in creating a beautifil design, such as Bodoni or Vilna.

Do you agree?

Your design is very good. Does this font have a name? Do you have a sans version.

I created sans and san serif designs based on Ariel Hebrew, by my friend Boruch Gorink, a Lubavitcher in Crown Heights Brooklyn, called Safed. I think that I posted a sample.

Safed is also a uniform stroke weight. I want to created also a set of non-uniform stroke widths, where the vertical stroke widths are wider than the horizonal ones, for the Hebrew only users, and where the horizontal stroke widths are wider than the vertical ones, for the Western users and/or mixing with Roman languages.

In your email message you refer to helping, but I am unsure to what you are referring. Are you referring to Volt programming?

		<div class="commentbody">Btw, I would change the angle of the left horizontal stroke to match the tet's left horizontal stroke.

In this way, the left space would be roomier, and appear not so "dark" from a distance.

I would create a non-nikkud version of the ayin, where the right horizontal stroke reaches farther below the baseline.

I would shorten the top vertical bar of the gimmel to increase the "breathing space". Most designers do not extend the top vertical bar of the gimmel to equal the length of the bottom stroke.

See the noon for a good example.

I will comment upon the aleph later. There are excellent design elements there, but I question the validity of the "spitz" in the top left hand part. Although the intention to make the aleph match other letters is important, I think it may be excessive, as most designers do not do so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>John Hudson told me that the Volt programmers at Microsoft observed that Biblical Hebrew represented the ultimate test of Volt programming. Is anything more complex?</em>

That's not quite what I said, Israel. What I actually said is that my VOLT project for SBL Hebrew was the most complex Sergey had seen at that date. Since then, I've made the Gabriola display typeface, which is more complex than the SBL Hebrew, and am now working on an Arabic project that is more complex still.

Biblical Hebrew is complex because of the contextual behaviour of the marks. The Gabriola font is complex because of the multiple stylistic options and the contextual behaviour of the letters. The Arabic involves contextual behaviour of both letters and marks, as well as contextual interaction between the two.

Biblical Hebrew is certainly complex, but because the rules for mark behaviour are established by the masoretic codices, the limits of that complexity are quite circumscribed. The actual letters are very regular and do not connect or otherwise interact -- even in the cursive style, Hebrew is notable for involving very little ligation --, so as long as one has worked out the contexts for the vowel and accent behaviour one has reached the extent of the complexity.

[Performing automatic sheva na-nach ect' at the glyph substitution level will certainly add to the complexity of VOLT contextual lookups, but as I've argued before, I don't believe that semantic distinctions should be made at the glyph level even when it is possible, and if something requires dictionary support in some instances then that's all the more reason for it so be a character level operation.]</div>

first, open type operates fast and is online, not as a script that takes more time and must be ran every timr a change is made.

second. this product is wanted and used bt meny publishers who find it very usful.

third, becouse their is no unicode for shevana, there is no standart where these glyphs should be.

doing a task like this manualy for an intire TANACH would take years.

if it works, and works well, there is no reason not to take an OT solution.

My point is that there should be a Unicode for shevana, just as there is to distinguish the different qamats. This is a semantic distinction that some users wish to make, and semantic distinctions are properly handled at the character level, because they should not be lost just because the user changes fonts. I'm happy for you if you have a solution that works for your needs, but your needs are not everyone's needs and having a clear understanding of what belongs at the character level and what belongs at the glyph level is necessary to standardisation of text encoding and display.</div>

In normal modern hebrew there is no need for qamats qatqan and sheva na.
in traditional hebrew they come to use, but remember, in traditional text we use traditional type faces.
Frankruel, Haddasa, Vilna, Droglin, Koren, Ivri.

Publishers from all over the world order my developments, because who ever needs these distinctions have no other solution but the solution i provide.


until now there is no other solution like a program or script do complete the task.

So this argument is more of principle than actual.
if you can come up with a better solution, be blessed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, it is an argument from principle, but in the area of text encoding principle tends to win out eventually. Sheva na was not proposed to Unicode at the same time as qamats qatan because there was uncertainty over the best way to encode it. Mark Shoulson, who co-wrote the qamats qatan encoding proposal, documented three different ways of representing the sheva na in text, as used by three different major publishers. If I recall correctly, two involved marks below the letter and one involved a mark above the letter. Since Unicode encodes what is 'on the page' rather than semantics, this presented a confusing case, and Mark decided to proceed with the simpler qamats qatan encoding proposal independent of the sheva na issue. Since then, I get the impression that there might be more agreement on the 'proper' way to indicate sheva na, and hence an encoding proposal might be easier to produce and have approved.

I've written to Mark to bring this discussion to his attention, in case he wants to comment on or correct anything that I've written.

I'm not criticising your fonts Eli, and I understand that your very clever OTL approach is the only current option. I'm just saying that a semantically significant text entity should be an encoded character, not a glyph variant, and that based on this principle sheva na should be encoded in Unicode.</div>

As a programer I think i could write an application to do this at a character level.
But.....

As you understand I am mainly a simple type designer who tries to give typographic solutions.

when giving a solution as OT it's easier to protect your work than an application that any one can make an iligale copy and use it and you can never proove it where with a font you can recognize the type face as yours.

		<div class="commentbody">Not being familiar with what Qamatz Qatan, Shva Na, and Meteg <em>are</em>, I looked them up on the Internet.

I see that there is more to this than the issues addressed in some of the papers about typesetting Hebrew with TeX, which discuss such matters as having a symmetry axis for each letter to govern positioning of vowel points when more than one vowel point symbol is applied to the same letter.

Specifically, Kamatz Katan, for example, is an alternate form of one vowel point used to indicate an alternate pronunciation <em>which no longer exists in modern Hebrew</em>.

So the question isn't really "can this be automated", but rather "does one wish to automate this". Many word processors include dictionaries for the purpose of spell-checking. One could, theoretically, have a Latin font that comes with a very long embedded program which also does spell checking, but if that's <em>inside the font</em>, then there's no interface with which to override any decisions the font makes to change the spelling of a word you want to print.

There are things that can't be automated within a font in a useful manner even if they're not so complicated that they can't be handled algorithmically - because the font is the wrong place to do it.</div>

I disagree.

Shai L'Mora publishes davka prefer Mincha Shai.
Many argue in Chabad the 5th 6h and 7th Lubavitcher Rebbes chose Rabbi Zalman Henna.

The Vilna Gaon, and ArtScroll wanted Rabbi Eliyahu Bachur.

this is john hudson's view

what is the ot level, if not an ot font?



>>  any qamats that the following letter has a dagesh hazaq the qamats is qatan unless you hav a qamats under the letter with the dagesh hazaq

so i need to define dagesh hazak in order to define a kamatz katan or kamatz gadol
is there anything else?
how do i define a dagesh as either chazak or kal?

kollel revach cites words in prayer that if there is no kamatz katan symbol, it is not just mispronounced but means a different word. in short, that word must show a kamatz katan.

is there any word that should have a shva-na, and by not showing a shva-na, it s not just mispronounced but means a different word.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">gohebrew, may I give you tip before you post your next post:

type away but <em>before</em> you hit the post button on your keyboard do the following:
<li>assess whether what you have just said is relevant to the thread (I give away is if you start typing in Yiddish or mention that you are Lubavitch, then you probably should be rewriting it)</li>
<li>can you rewrite what you have said in less words? Remember it takes people time to read this and let's respect that time.</li>
<li>will you have more to say? there is nothing more irritating than seeing 10 posts in a row from one person. Perhaps ponder your paragraph, have a little break and then write a little more (again <em>before</em> hitting the "Post" button.</li>
<li>are you creating a chillul hashem by what you write? How is what you are writing being perceived by somebody else. If you are calling other people names, or accusing them of theft, how will you be perceived and how will am yisrael be perceived. Look at previous posts by others making comments on this. Is this constructive?</li>
<li>finally there are many experts on this forum. Respect their opinions, after all that's the point of this forums. This isn't your personal Hyde Park corner.</li>

I have more to say, but inline with point number 2, I'll end this here.

I have never discussed the talent of Zvika Rosenberg. This is not relevant to me since I use the Koren font at work which is not Zvika Rosenberg's "talent". However, with regards to all my dealings with fonts over many years and several companies, I have found Rosenberg to be incredibly honest. I can only judge a person on my personal experience, but I can publicly say that my dealings with Masterfont from my very first dealings when I made aliya in 1993 at Dfus HaMakor, to the Jerusalem Post, then my only firm and now at Koren has been extremely professional and both him and his wife are an absolute pleasure to do business with.
> e) the necessity to keep Typophile as sterile and impersonal as possible
true.
> f) will the NY Yankees win the world series next year
on this one, I can firmly say that i have no opinion whatsoever. I'm assuming you are talking baseball and not cricket right?

I am happy for you that your business dealing with Mr. Rosenberg and his company Masterfont has been good since 1993, after I made yerida in 1988.

Perhaps, I believe lashon hora and motzei shem rah, improper speech and slander.

I know that I have given font software from Ofek, Masterfont, and others in Israel. Most were poorly made, often with missing glyphs. We never used their inferior software. 

Rather, new outlines with different bezier control points were created. Often, new US Copyrights were subject to new US Copyright registration, to avoid any legal pikpuk speculation. This has always been my consideration since 1986, when I founded Otzar HaOht, the Typeface Treasury, when Tzvika was riding a bike to Apple Israel's offices at Yeda Computers.

Eli, I do design typefaces. I created the first Arabic font in 1987. I sold Hebrew fonts for bundling with laser printers then as well. I created the first set of BeloRussian typefaces in 1989, when I sold the first Macintosh typesetting system to the post-Gorbachov Minsk-based government.  Later, I created and sold Ukrainian fonts for a printer.

I prefer to revive old designs, as they are not available.

I seek to do things that benefit people. On the way, G-d sends me parnasa via different jobs.

I think the automatic shva-na would be a great accomplishment, despite what you and others say. Only G-d knows the future.</div>

I did it, so i know it can partially be done to a 99%.
but you first have to know your stuff.
just having matirial is not enough
