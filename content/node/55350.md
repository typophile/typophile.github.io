  I still feel like I know so few compared to those who are out there.  I'm not sure
  how long he will be my favorite, but for now, I think I like Stefen Sagmeister's
  work.  I find it super interesting, and it is definitely not like anything I've
  ever seen before.  I love that he uses the human body in different ways and that
  he uses very interesting media.  I find that his work has a useful and good message
  behind it.  I think its uniqueness makes it special, and I think his work will be
  around for a very long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sagmeister-book-versions_6579.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/15_4Lg_6381.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ssinstallation2_3694.jpg]\r\n(Bananas!)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sagmeister.com/index.html\r\n"
