body: "I would love to find a way to generate diacritic glyphs in Fontlab. The issue
  is that most of my base glyphs (eg. a, n, r, A, N &t.) are constructed from components,
  which means Fontlab's 'Generate Glyphs...' does not work. Other people must surely
  have been in this situation before, and I would imagine that one could script ones
  way out of this. Now the thing is that I can't write scripts, so does anyone know
  a workaround that does not involve decomposing the components in all the baseglyphs?
  Or does anyone have a script, or know of one, that would be available to do this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nClaus"

    situation while you are building? If it is just temporary, then I would just hold
    off till you feel you have them solidly designed before creating diacritic glyphs.\r\n\r\nOr
    perhaps you have commitment issues! LOL"

  body: "It's a temporary situation until I have to produce the fonts. I really have
    to keep it that way when I take it to Multiple Master. And I prefer to test with
    actual text that use those diacritical characters. Imagine that I would have to
    redo either the components or the diacritics manually after I could see from the
    test texts that a change is necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd I can't commit, but that is
    beside the point. :-P"

  body: Could you perhaps copy all the components into the mask layer, decompose all
    the outline layer glyphs, do your auto diacritics glyphs, and switch and repeat
    until satsfied. Even saving 2 files (1 with the composites and 1 decomposed),
    and assigning the needed font to the mask layer and switch as needed would be
    fairly easy.

  body: FontForge should do the thing you're asking with <em>relative</em> ease, though
    not necessarily for other functions. If it can really aid your workflow, it may
    be worth it to at least try.

  body: "I conducted an experiment to see how easy this would be to do in FontForge.\r\n\r\nI
    drew three glyphs at one, two, and three, and by copying references from them
    assembled A:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/construction1_6264.png]\r\n\r\nI
    then drew a series of accents:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/construction2_5217.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    the font view I selected all of the accented A glyph slots, then from the Element
    menu chose Build > Build Accented Glyph. The following were generated automatically:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/construction3_3966.png]\r\n\r\nIs
    this the sort of procedure you had in mind?"

  body: "\"I really have to keep it that way when I take it to Multiple Master.\"\r\nI
    think, if I understand you, and I've been there having made an entire serif old
    style font from components, if you want to keep the base glyphs as components
    so you can get their design correct all the way through to multiple styles in
    a variation technology (MM in this case), then you really do not need to see accented
    versions yet. I mean, I've never made changes to the base glyphs based on what
    I saw in accented characters, it's always the other way around. So, short of some
    helpful script that decomposes and recomposes, maybe there's no problem? :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"
