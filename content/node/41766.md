  body: I for one have promised myself not to use Illustrator for sketching type again.
    Since it's so specialised they should have made it for Fontlab. Huge timesaver
    that would be, but in Illustrator the time one saves is eaten up moving the designs
    into Fontlab.

    Pen before write this topic.\r\nIt much editable and simple, than tableet.\r\nIt

    not wanting to create the glyphs in Illustrator and then move them into Fontlab,
    as doing so can be a PITA. It could be great for lettering artists, or designers
    who can letter but have limited time budgets and can\u2019t take the time to clean
    up their own work for publication. \r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s still irrelevant to the
    50%+ of designers who don\u2019t work on Windows."

    ongoing 'Kalliculator' (http://www.kalliculator.com/) and the soft Marc Antoni
    Malagarriga and  Daniel Rodriguez Valero are developing (http://re-type.com/notaweblog/?p=71)."

  body: "This looks very nice, I often wanted a tool that can modulate stroke weight
    by numeric numbers.\r\nIt would be even better though, if it was in Fontlab than
    in Illustrator.\r\nAnd of course, for myself I don't mind, but lots of people
    would like to have it on a Mac than on a Windows machine...\r\n\r\nEdit: on the
    Download-page for the demo it says:\r\nCS3 and CS versions and Mac CS, CS2 and
    CS3 version will be available soon."

  body: "The main problem seems to me that once you have made the step from calligraphic
    drawing to contours you cannot go back.\r\n\r\nThis means that you either have
    to develop the whole typeface with the calligraphy tool, which would be difficult
    if you cannot actually typeset (does Live Pen export fonts?).\r\nOr, you would
    make the step to contours at some point but then you loose the advantage of making
    calligraphic adjustments unless you go back again, convert again and so on.\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    you should have a tool that controls stroke weight and transitions according to
    a calligraphic logic but is implemented on the basis of outlines in the first
    place (and in FL, of course). That would allow you to work in both 'modes' at
    the same time."

  body: "\r\nI just tested this tool briefly and was quite disappointed:\r\n\r\n1.
    I could not find any setting that allows to draw with a broad-nib pen.\r\n\r\n2.
    Also, there is no setting that controls the transition between thin and thick,
    it is always linear.\r\n\r\nIn that sense, it is far inferior to Kalliculator.
    None of the Noordzijan logic implemented.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can do all this
    by making up the letter with lots of individually adjusted nodes but then that
    is not quicker than drawing the contours straight away.\r\n\r\nAs I said, that
    was just a quick test, maybe I missed something."

    that Tim Ahrens was not able to consider how can imitate the lines drawn by split-pen,
    in which no Kalliculator.\r\n\r\nI am also surprised that no Tim drew attention
    to the number of points after expanding option. They were really little. Sorties
    when exporting to fontlab not found.\r\n\r\nThe only point - although the absence
    of any tutorial.\r\n"

    respect and be very loyal to them. I totally agree with you.\r\n\r\nI also belive
    that a person can be loyal to things: for example, I am not going to change my
    notebook yet, though it conflicts with passwords.\r\n\r\nLoyal is everthing. To
    my great regret, in Moscow did not have feather to the left, and searches yhe
    Internet for video lessons left ended in failure. I had thought that perhaps no
    one I encounted this problem and this must be change. Than I decided to loyal.\r\n\r\nI
    am very sorry that I have dissapointed you, but forgot to write that it was me.
    I am really sorry. \r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nAndrey Burdin."

    software is down, also, Fontlab purchased the software, but I've check with them
    and there is no release date for this year. This software is so hard to find on
    the web.

    does anyone have an opinions as to why none of these tools really became essentials?
    They are nice to fool around with, but it still does seem when the proper work
    needs to be done I still need my points and handles.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience,
    using the real world tool, and analyzing the results provides something applications
    can't emulate...yet. Or is it that most of us are proper fussy sorts who get off
    on plotting the most efficient curve (MEC) for our glyphs?"

    even understand how most type designers work. So something really brilliant like
    LivePen comes out as a Windows-only Illustrator plugin. But at least FontLab was
    able to buy it, and hopefully it will turn up in a future version of FontLab sometime
    around 2025."
