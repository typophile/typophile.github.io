		<div class="commentbody">So I skimmed through Javal's book, reading some short passages, photocopying longer ones for later (who knows when&hellip;), and scanning up a few things. What might be relevant in this thread is a comparison of the two alphabets made by Dreyfuss for Javal (although it's not clear how much direct guidance he got). Except for that large sample I showed above, they're both shown reduced by a &quot;photoengraving&quot; method to very small sizes. The largest size is 5 point, and here's what they look like: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16606.gif" alt="Javal_a.gif"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16607.gif" alt="Javal_b.gif"> <BR> <BR>Javal concludes by saying that the first one doesn't go far enough while the second goes too far. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Tiffany, I didn't see any explicit connections made by Javal with graphic minimalism (the Bauhaus per se didn't yet exist at his time), but I still think there's some commonality there, even though as JF says their conscious directions ended up very different. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I'm not sure when Javal evaluated Dreyfuss's alphabets, but I guess he must have still had enough of his vision, otherwise it would be pretty funny. The book must have come out some time afterwards*. On the other hand, Javal did continue to contribute greatly to science (including work on Braille) way after his blindness.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Could I get them from you, Hrant? <BR> <BR>I think we can do this. Although the more I look at this design the more I want to do it myself! :-/ It seems to represent that &quot;missing link&quot; even more than I originally thought. I realized this in looking at the italic (for which I was happy to find a setting in English): <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_italic.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_italic.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_italic.gif</a></a> <BR> <BR>It's a slanted roman of the highest order - the best I've ever seen. Not a result of saving money (like the ATF slanted romans), but an ideology tempered with typographic intelligence (unlike the fanatical approach of Morison). I thought my Patria italic was progressive - this is much more so. And it was designed over a hunder years ago! <BR> <BR>But the roman is no slouch either. The whole seems to be what the Grandjean/Jaugeon effort was <i>supposed</i> to be, without the sterility of the Didone class. A new well of possibilities! <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>The thing is, Chris, I'm not sure you even need me. There <i>must</i> be good specimens of this design. I think you should ask JFP for help in tracking those down (and in making sure nobody already has the rights to it - which I highly doubt). What you'd be looking for is Maison Deberny specimens from the late 19th century, or very early 20th. <BR> <BR>But let me know if you have other preferences of how to do this. Hey, maybe we should make it a Typophile collaboration? A revival might in fact be more managable for that model than an original creation - although not as intellectually challenging. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, here's what I'd suggest: <BR>Barring a sudden general interest in doing a collaborative Typophile deal, I'll try to track down the best specimen available: besides JFP, a &quot;font-line&quot; lead is Christian Paput (the Imprimerie Nationale's punchcutter, who once graciously gave me a tour of that venerable institution), although I only have a snailmail address for him. Once the best sample is made available, I'll get in touch with you and maybe I could serve as an informal consultant in the project, especially if you get brave and decide to do two optical masters (as this design deserves).

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, Amelia, great!! (Thanks Kent.) <BR>Yes, I saw that the Cary had that stuff, but wasn't expecting so much help so soon! <BR> <BR>As much as AMG seems fascinating, I don't need anything from it right now if you have actual Deberny specimens of the fonts in question. The fonts were made under the direction of Tuleu some time between 1878 and 1905, but I guess they were still selling them in 1923. They strike me as the sort of thing Charles Peignot wouldn't have liked, so maybe by the next specimen they got rid of them? Anyway, that's just a side question. <BR> <BR>&gt; switches to a one story &quot;g.&quot; <BR> <BR>First: switching to a monocular &quot;g&quot; for the display sizes makes perfect sense to me (it's great to see some people had already realized that and actually implemented it long ago*) because the binocular &quot;g&quot; is great for readability, but lacks harmony with the rest of the alphabet during conscious appreciation. I will be doing what Tuleu did in my own text fonts from now on. <BR> <BR>* I also like that old French style of old-style figures (with the 3 and 5 ascending) more than our general convention. <BR> <BR>That &quot;g&quot; is actually why I thought the #17 was the one I wanted. In the Javal book (which uses the #17 and the #18*) he shows a sample of the #16 at 30 point, and it has the mono &quot;g&quot;. So I thought the #17 was the one I wanted. I'm still a little bit confused though because he also shows a 5 point sample of #16, and that has the mono &quot;g&quot; as well**. So I would most like to see samples of #15-#16 I guess. What do you see as the differences between them? And what are the chances you could provide a hi-res scan of the full character set? <BR> <BR>* Javal mentions the #18 as being a variation on the #17 (with longer descenders, bringing the 9 point forms to 10 point). Not sure where it ended up. BTW, he also mentions the 8 point #17 as being a short-descender version of its 9 point - which would make it a nice cheap method of optical scaling. <BR> <BR>** Could they have switched to a mono &quot;g&quot; at the bottom range as well, to cater to legibility?! That would rule even more. <BR> <BR>In case you're wondering why Chris and I like this design: <BR>I think Chris likes it because he likes it (the best reason!), while I like it mostly because of its evolutionary singularity: it's like a &quot;missing&quot; offshoot from the Romain du Roi. I've been reading up on Fournier, Baskerville, Bodoni, Luce and Didot, and none of them are even close to it. Not even Grandjean had an italic that &quot;pure&quot;. It's like an entire class of font that I'd never seen before. Both Chris and I would like to see it digitized - preferably by ourselves! BTW, do you see any legal/ethical complications with that? <BR> <BR>Waiting for a reply with bated breath!  :-) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have been studying this work by Emile Javal, so naturally have ended up here.</p>
<p>I should mention that the reference to page 226 makes more sence if you look on page 225 where M. Telu gets a mention as does the beginning of the turned paragraph thanks ‘La maison Deberny’.</p>
<p>I think seeing the series 16 type as the missing link is interesting.</p>
<p>As I try to transcribe and create a gist translation of Chapter XVII, I see that some of M. Javal talks about is a typographic missing link. He is making many observations some of which I have not specifically had related to me before, but were more inert understandings.</p>
<p>He does have a somewhat methodical approach conducting his own experiments (apparently at home) and takes those results as a basis for his criticism.</p>
<p>I wonder if M. Javal consulted with M. Telu at Deberney et Cie in the development of series 16 (He and M. Telu definatly communicated), or that his finding are much based on what was relayed to him by M. Telu. M. Javal taking it upon himself to push typography further.</p>
<p>It has been good to see that kakaze continued with research and developed &ldquo;Telu&rdquo; - Good!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Notes accompanying my previous post:</p>
<p>Untitled – Size 5, (Experimental typeface proposal), 1905 [Charles Dreyfuss/Émile Javal].</p>
<p>Drefuss and Javal produced two sets of experimental letterforms embodying the principles set out in Émile Javal’s book. The following study looks at the “size 5”, the larger of the two unless direct comparisons are made. The font lacks typographic niceties, so looks unusual compared to other more refined typefaces like Fleischmann and Didot. Indeed the letters look like caricatures or cartoons of letterforms where their visual features are exaggerated.</p>
<p>The bold nature of the design means that it will still be visible at very small sizes. Shapes are used with non reliance on the counters. Other ways have been introduced to differentiate characters from each other. The act of identification of the letters is more important than the act of reading, therefore the set of letters lack cohesion. Because the letters are made up of even width strokes and geometric forms, the tops of the characters tend to have the same appearance density. Javal himself points out that the top half of the letters are important in identifying the character, however the type developed from his ideas lacks adherence to this observation.</p>
<p>In the type example given in the book [particulière se (fig. 68) p.229] some of the more challenging letters (in terms of structure) are omitted. These include the letters  k, j, y and z. This means that the Javal ‘Size 5’ proposal lacks a full set of characters which would have gone a long way to prove his case. Non completion of the character set possibly have contributed to a negative effect on the popularisation of his ideas.</p>
<p>It is noted that the s looks very similar to the lowercase Didot s, which looks out of place with the other characters. The s does seem to be one of the most challenging letters when it comes to reduction and exhibiting it at a small size. The s could look to the proposed z from the smaller character set as a potential solution.</p>
