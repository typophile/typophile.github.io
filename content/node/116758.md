  a lady who loves Geosans light and desperately wants her heading text, extra large
  in it. However, I am really struggling with a body text pairing. Her design is very
  stark and modern. Any ideas? Thanks so much"

  body: Why not continue using the same font for the body  text? Use larger than usual
    point size but reduce line space to make the text one well- defined block  - it
    could even slightly overlap a very large heading.  With generous white margins
    all round. Starkly modern!
