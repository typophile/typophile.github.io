body: "hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI'm writing my bachelor thesis: It's topic is experimental
  typedesign.\r\nBy extremly pointig out formal basic elements (like form of serifs,
  stroke contrast, white space, proportion etc.) and combining them with emotional
  parameters (elegant, reliable, light, heavily etc.) I will create type-experiments,
  which are at the sidelines (but within the scope) of legibility.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nExecution
  will be performed in the following way:\r\n<strong>experiment</strong> #1 =\r\n<strong>parameters</strong>;
  formal and emotional (fragmented shapes (1-D) + serifs  (5-C) + hairline (3-A) +
  fashionable)\r\n+ <strong>hypothesis</strong> (\xBBeven less tha 60% of necessary
  elements would be readable\xAB)\r\n=> <strong>a new typeface</strong> or <strong>a
  proved impossibility</strong>\r\n\r\nThrough uncommon or hard realizable combination,
  interesting type-drafts and/or scribbled rudiments should be created. Nevertheless
  these fonts should follow typographical conventions and not become \xBBFree-Fonts
  \xE0 la dafont. com\xAB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next weeks, I'll post my first
  drafts.\r\n\r\nI'm rally happy for every single comment, every advise, every link,
  even for an abstruse combination of the parameters \u2026\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."
