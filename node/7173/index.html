  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The  United Nations is hosting Wolrd Enviroment Day in San Francisco in 2005. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its theme is;  World Cities:  Where the future lives. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess through my teacher they are going to pick a poster from my class that will be plastered throughout the city next year.  This  concept is the one that my class picked for me out of the three that I showed them.  I am not sure it says what the title says. What do yall think?  Do you think I should try to come up with another idea.  I would really want to take advantage of this situation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->btw I have another idea i never photographed it because I thought it might be hard to execute  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was to have a robot and women (mother earth) shaking hands it would only feature their hands close up and it would show that we are going to make a commitment to the future to improve our cities.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gregory, I find the skyline shilohette upside down disturbing and unnessary. I'm from Manhattan and skyline shilos bother me since 9/11. Next the photo looks like the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. No buildings, no people, no animals, just leaves not growing up but strewed along a (barren airport?). Hardly what I would like to experience in an urban green environment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I suggest is show positive aspects of new urban living. Wind fans generating electricity, parks, people planting trees on urban streets, public transportation. If you can do something abstract try emulating the 60s poster approach like a flower sticking out of a power plant smoke stack. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, you have &quot;World Environment Day&quot; but no date. You have to have a date. Investigate another typeface for &quot;Green Cities&quot; too much Gill Sans for my taste. &quot;Where the future lives&quot; doesn't mean anything. &quot;Where our future lives&quot; is somewhat better but need explaination and you have plenity of room on a poster to do it. Does the poster want someone to do something or just know the day exists. If its proactive have contact information, phone numbers</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thnx for the feedback. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John:  its funny because everyone ive shown the first one too said they liked it but when I tell them I feel like it has no meaning to me, they still say they like it  .  Maybe I should have developed it or tried to make a concept out of it, but I decided to move on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Daniel:  the arrow is supposed to represent a cycle.  I wanted to show that the city is a cycle.  Similar to the cycle in research and development. Constantly trying things and then when they dont work, you try them again.  I guess I was trying to address the technology part.  Iam unsure that it reads right; and now that you have questioned it. I may take it out.  I will see what I can do with the colors.  This is due soon and I need to send it to the printer.  Thnx for your advice! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall iam bummed on the outcome!  I like the new direction better. I learned from this process that communication is hard.  I usually dont get most posters or design and as a result its hard for me to communicate to others.  Ive had some more simple ideas but i didnt think they were fresh or visual compelling which a poster is supposed to be. In general book covers and posters are hard for me.  I  am starting to realize my interests are identity and typoghraphy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">gregory &hellip; a few things stands out as needing work,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if you indeed keep your current layout. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* the butterflies are detailed and correct, shapewise,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while the ladybug is a simple circle, rather than its true shape. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I expected to see more GREEN in the design, but it feels <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more like something for a Ciudad del Sol, than Green City. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* the word cities is kind of a strange, when it sits <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by itself. I think you can do something better with cities <!-- raw HTML omitted -->than Scriptina out of the box. Take a look at: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- the i-t-i combination. There is a possibility for some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->life here. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- extending the s with a longer finishing stroke. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- the t swash that gets too close to the e. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you sketch some letterforms on a piece of paper, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you'll see that your hand can create something better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->than what you have. Sketching is a good thing&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or get a calligraphy pen at  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an art store and write on a napkin &hellip; the ink bleed is beautiful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bj</div>
