    - he has the answer and hopefully he'll be allowed to share it. \r\n\r\nIt is
    however interesting that hinted TrueType, an Apple invented and Apple controlled
    (via their patents) technology, has been largely abandoned in their recent products
    (Mac OSX and iPods), but continues to gain some traction over bitmap and PS fonts
    in the device, rich media and OSS space."

    has, if not abandoned, certainly deprecated it. Unless MS\r\nis playing the blossom-slowly
    cleverness with CT and we'll end\r\nup seeing superhinted CT one day! For example
    note how originally\r\ny-direction hints were not included, but soon they will;
    although\r\nthe official stance seems to be that was for reasons of previously\r\ninadequate
    rasterization performance.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    that with respect to the higher profile MS work, but in reality we're still spending
    a lot of money on hinting, and I think all the hardcore TT hinters are being kept
    very busy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes hinting time allowed and the money companies are willing to pay or invest
    has decreased. But FontLab has increased the speed of production dramatically
    by including a decent AutoHinter and Python support.\r\n\r\nI learned Python in
    a few hours and in less than a week I wrote enough functions to make a 250 glyph
    font into a 650 glyph font with extended fractions, superiors, inferiors, and
    accents to cover up to European Ext-A. Been able to batch process glyph names
    and other font info to fix or rename whole families and write out a fully localized
    name table all within the FontLab file. \r\n\r\nYou can also hint to a similar
    level by using the autohinter then changing it's hints or adding your own. \r\n\r\nSo
    in the long run we are hinting/creating font files that are 3 times as big as
    we did five years ago, hinting to the same level and doing all that for 1/2 the
    price in 1/3 of the time. \r\n\r\nClearType and the Mac OS-X fuzzies have eliminated
    the need for heavy hinting but there are still situations that require manually
    hinted TrueType."

  body: "First, here's something from Peter:\r\n\"\r\nTrueType and TT-CT hinting have
    never been used by OSX.\r\nEverything is anti-aliased by the Quartz 2D rendering
    engine.\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/macosx/features/quartzextreme/\r\n\r\nOlder QuickDraw
    APIs still use hinting below the user-nominated\r\nthreshold size (usually 12pt).\r\n\"\r\n\r\nI've
    asked him a follow-up question or two, and will report back.\r\n\r\nBTW, this
    older API business makes me wonder:\r\nIs there a not-too-inelegant way of bypassing
    the OSX fuzzy\r\nrendering so a font could get its hinting kicking in again?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAnd
    now I have another question:\r\nHow do CT fonts render out when their hints are
    ignored?\r\nDo they look like \"regular\" AA-ed fonts, or do they come out worse?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nVincent,
    that was a great synopsis - a keeper.\r\n\r\n> FontLab has increased the production
    time dramatically\r\n\r\nYou mean decreased?\r\n\r\n> for 1/2 the price in 1/3
    of the time.\r\n\r\nAh, leveraging some new margin in the new system, eh?  ;-)\r\n\r\n>
    ClearType and the Mac OS-X fuzzies have eliminated the need for heavy hinting\r\n\r\nYou
    mean heavy <cite>manual</cite> hinting, right? Because I'm\r\nwondering how that
    jives with \"we are hinting/creating\r\nfont files that are 3 times as big\",
    which confused me.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    but soon they will</em>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean by this
    Hrant. Y-direction hints, including deltas, are supported in current CT rasterisers
    and, as far as I know, they always have been. This makes sense, since the sampling
    gain is only in the x-direction. You need y direction hints to establish consistent
    alignment and horizontal stroke weight.\r\n\r\nWhat is new in the Vista CT rasteriser
    is gasp table controlled y-direction greyscale antialiasing."

    grab of the new CT fonts (or I guess any highly CT-optimized fonts) when installed
    on OSX? Especially nice would be a comparison against some \"native\" OSX fonts.
    Failing that, if there's a way to turn off (or maybe you'd have to remove) the
    hinting in the new CT fonts and show how they come out on Windows that would be
    good too.\r\n\r\nPlease? Pretty please with pixels on it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
