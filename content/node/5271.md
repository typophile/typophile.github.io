  <BR>Can anyone tell what the font in this logo is. I&#39;ve tried a few including:
  akzinenz, univers, news gothic, trade gothic, helvetica, swiss 721 and zurich. The
  closest was zurich, but Zurich wasn&#39;t quite narrow enough as well as a few other
  character differences.'

    done some horizontal tweaking.

  body: Nope... That&#39;s not Conduit &#34;t&#34;. It&#39;s Din alright. Maybe Din
