  am about to start a new brief for my BA Graphic Design course and I have chosen
  to do a competition brief set by the ISTD (link below).\r\nThere are a few briefs
  to chose from but I have chosen one which involves creating two contemporary and
  explorative type specimens for two of Monotypes fonts.\r\n\r\nIn relation to this
  I wanted to ask here and see if anyone knows of any really good contemporary type
  specimens, that I can look at for inspiration. I have searched and found some, but
  wanted a second, third or fourth opinion :)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSam\r\n\r\n[[http://www.istd.org.uk/education]]"
