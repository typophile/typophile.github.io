  body: I think the &#39;i&#39; is the best character!  <BR> <BR>The &#39;t&#39; is
    a bit of a stretch. Why are you afraid to do a crossbar? <BR> <BR>Excellent idea
    on the &#39;Q&#39;.

  body: Hey wow, thanks alot Kyle! You rule. <BR>Now that you can actually see the
    face, I should probably explain my idea. <BR> <BR>I looked to some of  Herbert
    Beyers early faces in addition to many other modular, grid fonts and geometric
    sans faces for inspiration.  I wanted to mesh the formulaic and reconstructing
    attributes of modular design with a touch of humanistic qualities to give a bit
    of spontaneity to the forms.   Thus, a kind of subtle man vs. machine characteristic.
    <BR>I limited myself to vertical and horizontal segments &amp; one radius for
    the construction. <BR>

  body: Bye the way, Thanks for the advice so far, and thanks a ton Kyle.....what
    did you do? <BR> <BR>The green characters I feel need some help, and the Pink
    characters I feel are very bothersome.  I am working on making alternate characters
    to be included in the face to play along with the title of the face-Stereotype-.  The
    characters are simular in thier construction, but by using shift or option you
    could get alternates to kind of destroy the stereotype of preconcieved ideas of
    what the next typed character will look like.

  body: <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7134.jpg" alt=""> <BR>Here
    is the beginnings of the numerals, and some punctuation, etc. I am not sure about
    which @ I like better, and again characters in green are possible alternates/replacements.
    <BR>Your suggestions are greatly appretiated. <BR>My grade depends on it!  Thanks!

  body: I think it has some nice aspects to it, but I have to translate it in my head
    before I know what it says. I simply can&#39;t read those Ts. It looks like &#34;SLEREOLYPE&#34;
    to me. Actually, the O bothers me a lot. Nothing wrong with a plain old circle,
    or even just a circle that doesn&#39;t close at the top. Rotate the zero 45 degrees
    so you have a diagonal bar, and you&#39;ve got a nice joke on dot-matrix zeroes.
    <BR> <BR>The &#34;ED&#34; ligature is very, very interesting. Something very Shakespeare-gone-modern
    about that.

    -for some reason I have not changed them, I think I got used to them and just
    needed someone like you to wake me up to how problematic they actually are. Thanks. '

  body: i disagree with chesh, i really enjoy what&#39;s going on with the t.  its
    all subtle and ramp-like and the shape is repeated throughout the type.  nice
    work, will.
