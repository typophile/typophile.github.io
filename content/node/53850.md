  and prefer not to draw the type.\r\nAny clues on what font this might be?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/theprod_5216.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks"

    is similar to most of these letters. I think only the E and R would need to be
    replaced, and I am sure these can be found in other 'Futuristic' fonts. Of course,
    some squooshing(tm) would be needed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Any other guesses?"

    convincing them to redesign it. That thing looks like garbage."

  body: "lol I agree. Oh well I just used Nasalization and altered the P, R and E.
    It looks close enough. \r\n\r\nPaul, trust me, over half of the artwork that comes
    into my hands to deal with needs to be seriously redesigned, however the customer
    is rarely for it since it costs money. This is what happens in the world of promotional
    products and printing...:("
