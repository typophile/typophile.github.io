body: Hi again. I&#39;m having some trouble with a logo I decided to help a friends
  band with. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions as on what to do? The original idea was to have
  some sort of ligature, but none of the ligatures I tried to make looked good. <BR>
  <BR>This is what I have got so far, the &#34;lundstr&ouml;m bygdell&#34; part is
  temporary, I&#39;m looking for another condensed and good looking typeface &#40;current
  is trade gothic condensed no 20&#41;. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1366.gif"
  ALT="logo"> <BR> <BR>Suggestions welcome, it would be a huge plus if the typeface
  was available from the font folio 9 disc as my budget for this job is $0.

    Like the logo to a dentist&#39;s office. Maybe pretend for a moment that LB is
    really a dentist&#39;s office, and design the logo of their nightmares. '

  body: ' Doh, I usually don&#39;t forget to describe the client when it comes to
    logo critique. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a nu-jazz band. meaning they play jazz but incorporate
    samplers and syntheziers in their music... They are also some sort of conceptual
    band, so they don&#39;t stick completely to the jazz route.  <BR> <BR>I wanted
    a logo that was relatively neutral for the above reason, but when I think about
    it, it should be something organic. <BR> <BR>As for the dentist office comment,
    yeah, I have had it before... :/ <BR> <BR>Back to the drawing board I guess.  <BR>
    <BR>Suggestions for a condensed gothic typeface? &#40;other than trade gothic&#41; '

    out the logo here: <BR><A HREF="http://www.thtfct.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.thtfct.com/</A>
    <BR> <BR>And there was also a logo shown here on Typophile, but I can&#39;t find
    it now - it was a lc &#34;b&#34; with some amorphous border - that was great too.
    <BR> <BR>Ligation: too often it&#39;s relied on as a gimmick, but here it might
    actually make sense. If the band were German I&#39;d suggest trying to make an
    eszet look like an &#34;L&#34; &#43; &#34;B&#34;... Or what about this: try merging
    the &#34;L&#34; &#43; &#34;B&#34; into something that looks like a musical note,
    like maybe that clef thing. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=musical%2Bsymbols"

    to turn your current logo into a musical &#34;repeat&#34; bar -- the double bar
    with two dots next to it &#40;the two dots, of course, would be formed by the
    counters of the &#34;B&#34;&#41;. This way ou could keep the &#34;LB&#34; direction

  body: I&#39;m playing with the idea of growing branches, and perhaps flowers &#40;but
    that&#39;s stretching it a bit&#41; on the LB part, to emphazise the jazz in an
    interesting way, it helps getting away from the corporate look IMHO. Here&#39;s
    a small update &#40;only sketches&#41;. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1375.gif"
    ALT="branching"> <BR> <BR>I feel that the first one is the best looking, extensive
    ornamentation might be interesting but It&#39;s quite difficult to get good looking
    branches <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
    <BR> <BR>Comments? <BR> <BR>As for the musical note ideas, I thought of it from
    the beginning, tried a few... but the band didn&#39;t want anything obviously
    related to music, very interesting ideas and links non the less. Thanks.

    <BR>Makes sense. And the botanical angle is cool. But you&#39;re right about avoiding
    too much ornamentation. <BR> <BR>The left one is the best, but it really looks
    like an &#34;L&#34; licking an &#34;R&#34;. The licking might actually be a plus
    &#40;and in any case the two forms seem to be interlocking nicely&#41;, but of
    course not the &#34;R&#34; part. BTW, have you tried a leaf, instead of a branch?

  body: Nope, haven&#39;t tried a leaf... I&#39;ll do that. <BR> <BR>One request I
    got from the band was to make the logo less fat... It had the downside that the
    B began to look as an R instead. I&#39;ll try to fix it, but I might end up scrapping
    the LB &#34;ligature&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for ornamentation, Bj&ouml;rk &#40;or her
    design bureau&#41; have made some nice ornamented design, but as stated previously,
    it&#39;s difficult to get it looking good. &#40;not to mention print and especially
    web issues...&#41; <BR> <BR>As for branching, I&#39;ve found a flash magazine
    that had some nice animated flowers with the look I&#39;m going for &#40;http://www.thisisamagazine.com&#41;
