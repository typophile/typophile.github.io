body: "\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/231069_3666.gif]\r\n\r\nI once went
  into the Louisiana Art & Science Museum in Baton Rouge to discover, much to my dismay,
  an entire exhibit on Egypt laced with descriptions typed in Papyrus typeface.  First
  off, this is an ART and science museum, and the designer in me just died.  Second,
  what is the obsession with Papyrus? A 2-point analysis:\r\n\r\n1.) It's \"edgy\"
  (vomit).  In thinking of the unstructured edges of the Papyrus letterforms, some
  (non-designers) think that the result is an artistic, \"fancy\" font. WRONG. Quite
  the opposite.  Papyrus pigeonholes design into the realm of the overdone, tired,
  and just plain terrible.\r\n\r\n2.) It needs to be put on everything as body text!!!
  Rebuttal: Poor legibility. Need I say more?\r\n\r\nPlease stick to the basics if
  discerning good type from bad type is not your strong suit.  Baskerville and Garamond
  would appreciate it.  Thank you, and happy Mardi Gras!"

  body: Although I'm pretty much with you, and would never use it myself, I was surprised
    a couple years back when I was at a zoo where they use it on all their signage,
    and it struck me as not being that bad. The letterspacing is really awful, though,
    which is the part I can't stand about Papyrus. That P is about a foot away from
    the "...apyrus."

  body: "I completely agree. I go to school in Savannah, GA. Over the last year I've
    counted at least nine or ten different places that use Papyrus on their signs.
    On one of the main roads in the historic district you can walk three quarters
    of a mile and pick out at least four separate businesses that use it. Everything
    from sushi restaurants to boutiques. Hideous.\r\n"

  body: "I actually think Papyrus is an elegant design. Classic, yet highly original
    calligraphic letterforms, with a treatment that invokes ink on actual papyrus
    ( a very rough surface I can attest). The only problem is usage. To be effective,
    such an original face needs to appear sparingly, not just in its application,
    but in the broader social context. That is, any use of papyrus in the world around
    you makes every other use a bad choice.\r\n\r\nI just want to distinguish bad
    design (spacing aside) from bad usage. \r\n\r\nUsage is all about context. Any
    designer who wants to use Papyrus as a display font at the end of the nineteenth
    Century, or the begging of the 20thC, should not be dissuaded by your thread."

    but in how it's improperly used and overused."

  body: I think my main gripe is just that the typeface itself has so much baggage.  It
    doesn't allow the words to really speak for themselves because the design is not
    subtle.  So I agree with you to a point, BeauW.

  body: "I like Papyrus. I think that it is just fine. \r\n\r\nOverused? Sure. \r\n\r\nNot
    for every use? Well, what typeface is?\r\n\r\nThe P a in Papyrus in the sample
    above is probably that way because the program that made that sample graphic didn't
    support kerning."

  body: "Papyrus is not a horrible font to begin with, but its uses are what make
    me cringe every time I see it: history teachers trying to be \"authentic\" when
    teaching a lesson about Ancient Egypt, Rome, Native Americans, etc., small businesses
    such as spas, t-shirt stores, or galleries, and so many more. I cannot even begin
    to count the times I have seen the font.\r\nStrangely, I see Papyrus used more
    on the West Coast than the East. A font overused in the East is Copperplate."
