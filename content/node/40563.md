  After some research I have to say that most of printers' websites don't look very
  inviting, to put it mildly.\r\n\r\nI guess Typophile, full of people publishing
  for print, is the right place to ask my questions. Your feedback would be much appreciated.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>What
  is the first thing you are looking for when visiting a printer's website?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Do
  you think that the quality of a printers' website may be an indication of their
  services quality? If a site is too complicated - do you leave it and forget it or
  are you trying e-mail or call them?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Do you prefer to get a quote
  on-line or do it over a phone?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>What else would you expect from a
  good printers' website?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIf you have anything else to add, please
  don't hesitate to do so.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "1. Contact information... even if its on every page!\r\n\r\n2. Yes, I think
    it will really reflect on the printer as do all websites. Keep it really simple
    no flash crap! People will only spend about 30 seconds on a page maybe less and
    if they can't get what they're looking for they'll just go back to google!\r\n\r\n3.
    I dont mind really, I don't like to fill in online forms I prefer an email address
    with a fast responce. (maybe a standard price list, but not loads of reading)
    \r\n\r\n4. Some examples of work shot professionally, work done by previous designers...
    a small bit dont go crazy!\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is to keep it simple
    don't over design it.\r\n"

  body: "NO ON-LINE QUOTES!\r\nI never get quotes on line or on the phone. I e-mail
    specifications to printers and I ask them to send me quotes back by e-mail.\r\n\r\nI
    find that no printer's web site quote apparatus is sufficient for me to convey
    all the info I need to give them. I have a boilerplate spec form that I customize
    to each project. I rarely get calls or e-mails asking me to clarify specifications.
    When I try to convey specifications via inadequate on-line forms I always get
    calls about what I meant. Usually the calls are stupid calls that could have been
    answered by the caller if she/she had taken 2 more minutes. \r\n\r\nOther than
    that, I want to know what kinds of books they produce, and especially what their
    binding capabilities are. I like to be able to see what kinds of text stock they
    keep on the floor.\r\n\r\n& I don't care about the ability to upload files to
    a website or ftp site. I always send printers a stack of page proofs anyway, so
    I might as well burn the files to a CD and send it along. Not that much time difference.\r\n\r\nI
    realize that the quality of a web site has little to do with the quality of a
    finished book. But still, if I have to look at these things, I do hope they will
    be easy to navigate, at the very least. I do not want to see any stock photos
    of one person peeping over the shoulder of someone else sitting at a monitor.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "   1. What is the first thing you are looking for when visiting a printer\u2019s
    website?\r\n-Technical capabilities, prices and turnaround time.\r\n\r\n   2.
    Do you think that the quality of a printers\u2019 website may be an indication
    of their services quality? If a site is too complicated - do you leave it and
    forget it or are you trying e-mail or call them?\r\n-I would expect a competent
    and professional printer to likewise respect the quality of designer's work and
    invest in a conceptually sound and aesthetically pleasing website. At the same
    time, I would rather go for a relatively simple and crudely made site, then a
    confusing multi-tabbed juggernaut of marketing nonsense. I expect my relationship
    with the printer to be direct and personal, and the latter type of a site, would
    suggest the nightmarish future of being bounced between faceless departments,
    with all of the confusion, mistakes and misunderstandings that can arise from
    that.\r\n\r\n   3. Do you prefer to get a quote on-line or do it over a phone?\r\n-Online
    (via email) if possible.\r\n\r\n   4. What else would you expect from a good printers\u2019
    website?\r\n-Easy transfer of large files, examples of prior work, easily accessible
    templates for commonly used cd's and folders, list of preferred formats and file
    specs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal Art

  body: I'm with Will, but I don't mind getting quotes over the phone. Perhaps I just
    don't trust myself or the printer enough. But I find that a conversation must
    take place in between myself and the printer. Discussing the project is where
    a lot of the bugs get worked out. If I only get a quote from a list of specifications
    and I don't get any remarks I worry that they are only scanning over what I've
    requested and are not really focussed on what I need.

  body: "Let me expand on what I earlier wrote.\r\n\r\nI only specify and buy printing
    for books, casebound and paperbound. I work with only six printers at the most
    over the course of a year. Sales and service staff at these printers and I know
    one another quite well. Specifications for books such as we publish are for the
    most part pretty standard. It is in the details where each differs from the others.\r\n\r\nThat's
    why I type out my specs and require in return quotes that can be shown on paper:
    I want that paper trail.\r\n\r\nPlus: I am a bit constrained in my bidding process
    by state purchasing regulations. The paperless office is not yet here: the Finance
    office requires a paper copy and I keep one on hand for reference. Storage of
    quotes will always be an issue: paper in file cabinets or files on a server which
    is already overcrowded.\r\n\r\npowers"
