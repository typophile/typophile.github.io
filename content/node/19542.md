body: "I'm creating the logo for a small interior design firm. The owner preferred
  initial mockups in Clearface Gothic and Officina Sans over more elegant (Bodoni,
  Didot, Optima, Centaur, Caslon Openface etc.) and contemporary (Gill Sans, Futura,
  Avenir, Helvetica, Mostra) ones. \r\n\r\nHere are my questions:\r\n\r\n1. Do you
  think a font like Clearface or Officina suits such a business's identity?\r\n\r\n2.
  What are some similar fonts I can consider? \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."

    Gothic seems a little out of date for a creative firm. I suppose it depends on
    what sort of interior design they want to be known for. Officina is not too bad,
    more modern, but overused. I'd consider one of these, gentle and friendly like
    Clearface and Officina, but less common and more up-to-date:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Cronos\">Cronos</a>\r\n<a

      you are. As a male, I was rooting for the more contemporary    geometric fonts.
      Thanks for your suggestions, Stephen, I'll be sure to look into them.\r\n\r\n<CITE>Clearface

      on this subject, what (semi-unique, not oft-used) typefaces would all of you
      consider \"in date\" for a creative firm? Would you have chosen some of the
      same fonts I have written down above?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The disatvantage of using a well know typeface in a logotype, could be that
    the unique feeling get lost a bit. Even if the letters themselves are edited,
    the typeface itself is soemtimes so familiar that the overall result is too \"common\"
    or \"flat\".\r\n\r\nMy advise would be to find slightly less familiar typefaces
    to start with for the logotype.\r\n\r\nYou might something apealing at http://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nGood
    luck"
