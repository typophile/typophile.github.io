body: Hi Typophiles! <BR> <BR>I was wondering about the origins and the further development
  of the so called pilcrow sign. All that i found was this small text. Does anybody
  of you know more about the &#34;clenched fist with the index finger extended, pointing
  right&#34;? <BR>How it looked like in the different epochs and how it was used?
  <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>hannum <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: I&#39;ve never heard the &#34;fist&#34; explanation. It sounds suspicious
    to me. There is a history of printer&#39;s fists with fingers pointing, used to
    draw attention, but I believe these derive from the 19th century and have never
    heard of them having anything to do with the pilcrow or paragraph mark. <BR> <BR>The
    pilcrow began as an ornate form of the letter &#39;C&#39; -- for &#34;capitulum&#34;
    -- and marked the head of an argument or thesis. You can see this form still in
    use in typefaces like Centaur which are based on the earliest type forms.  <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t recall exactly the evolution toward the current &#34;backward
    P&#34; form, but Hrant might have the references handy. Do you still have a copy
    of Parkes, Hrant? <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>

  body: if this helps with your research, i&#39;ve also read printer&#39;s fists referred
    to as &#34;bishops fists&#34; &#40;baseline magazine No 37, page 34&#41;. also
    on page 43-44 of rick poynor&#39;s book <i>typographica,</i> an article in a 1953
    issue of herbert spencer&#39;s magazine of the same name entitled, &#34;a show
    of hands&#34; by charles hasler about printer&#39;s fists is references; the book
    reproduces a portion of this article, including some beautiful examples of fists
    and their origins, and if your eyesight is good you can read a some of this article,
    which includes a discussion on how &#34;the only outstanding designer to turn
    his attention to the design of fists has been Eric Gill...&#34; the issue of the
    magazine itself i suspect would be very difficult to track down... &#40;i&#39;ve
    checked on ebay for old copies of the magazine, no luck&#41;. anyways, that&#39;s
    all i can think of for now. ciau!

    pretty rare. <BR>After half a dozen ILL requests at UCLA, I still haven&#39;t
    gotten my hands on all of them. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
