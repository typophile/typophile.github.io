  I pass by this building and admire this typeface. Surely it's something simple,
  but I can't quite place it. Help if you can.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nhttp://printinghousewestvillage.com/"

  body: Very Caslon-ish, something close to Caslon Graphique or Grouch... May be [[http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_big|Freight
    Big Black]]?

  body: It's the accent on the lowercase g that stands out so it's not Caslon Graphique,
    Grouch or Freight, but we're on the right track!

  body: Agree and Freight Big /t top and /a top left part look off too. So, definitely
    not Freight Big...
