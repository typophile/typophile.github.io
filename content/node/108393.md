body: "Hello,\r\nI'm hoping there are some former phototypesetting workers on here
  or possibly some folks who are knowledgeable in that area. I'm desperately hoping
  to accurately ascertain a certain font used in various magazines in the 1980s. I've
  included some examples below from three separate magazines.\r\n\r\nHere are the
  examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://sendbackmystamps.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/forever-2-reader-charts-playlists.jpg?w=949\r\n\r\nhttp://sendbackmystamps.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/editorial-news.jpg?w=949\r\n(main
  body text, not the headers)\r\n\r\nThe fonts are neither Signa nor Univers (the
  G and 9 are slightly different). Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!!\r\n"
