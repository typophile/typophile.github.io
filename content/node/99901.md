body: "I am currently a senior at the American University Dubai, majoring in graphic
  design. However I have a strong liking towards type design and I was wondering if
  anyone could recommend good type design firms to intern at.\r\n\r\nI was and still
  am working on a typeface that I created for my senior project.\r\n\r\nThe typeface
  that I am working on is based on the Devanagri script however is an adaptation to
  the latin typeface futura. I have worked independently on the typeface teaching
  myself how letterforms work. I was determine to get my basics right and therefore
  flew out to India for 5 days where an Indian type designer ( Prof. Mahendra Patel)
  guided me as I had no faculty member on campus or in Dubai to help me understand
  the script and build my sensitivity towards letterforms.\r\n\r\nI want to make my
  typeface part of reality. I need a lot more experience and if I get the chance to
  be exposed to the felid will help me develop my skill a lot more.\r\n\r\nAs of now
  this is my most important project and it is based on type design and it is one field
  I want to pursue.\r\n\r\nI have attached an image of what my typeface looks like.\r\n\r\nI
  graduate in May and just gaining some experience in the world of type would be a
  great opportunity for me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2013-01-21
