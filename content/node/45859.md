  Printing Museum in Carson, California. A DVD is available at [[http://www.calgold.com/calgold/Default.asp?Series=8000&Show=806|Howser's
  \"California's Gold\" website]]. The show is a little cornball, as all of Howser's
  stuff is, but the museum has some interesting items.\r\n\r\nThe museum's website
  is here: [[http://www.printmuseum.org/|International Printing Museum]]."
