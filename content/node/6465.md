  to redraw.  Any ideas?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47947.jpg"

  body: Clearly anything painted on an airplane in WWII wasn&#39;t done using a computer
    font. So that means you are looking for a font that might help approximate this
    lettering. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/condensed/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=ILL%20WIND"
    target="_blank">Clarendon Condensed</a> isn&#39;t quite as squared off, but it
    might work, and it is based on a design that is old enough to have been around
    as a model for this lettering. Another more popular style from the era is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cheltenham/"
    target="_blank">Cheltenham Extra Condensed</a>.
