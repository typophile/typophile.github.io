body: "Greetings,\r\nI was wondering if you might know which Bodoni is used throughout
  Steven Heller's beautiful book on Paul Rand. I think it's Berthold Bodoni Antiqua,
  but I want to make sure. As a follow-up, can you recommend your preferred version
  of this font for book use?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rand1_5825.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/rand2_4051.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/rand3_5479.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
  always, thank you!"

  body: "Yes, the Medium OSF, from the look of it.  \r\n\r\nAs for my preferred version,
    um, well, I really don't like using any Bodoni for lengthy texts -- I find the
    contrast to be difficult to read in extensive passages."

  body: I'm with Linda. I don't think there's a version of Bodoni that is particularly
    readable for text, at least compared with all the other didonesque options. <a

    might be the best text Bodoni as it was created to best match the metal size masters.
