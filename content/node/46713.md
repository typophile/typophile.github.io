  body: That is a typeface that is currently proprietary to Punchcut. Currently we
    use it for comping device UIs (mobile device screens) but if I have my way it
    will become the Punchcut house face. Glad you like it.

    as well, I think, judging from the characters I can see. I hope you consider releasing
    it commercially.    "
