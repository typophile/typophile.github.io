  looking for a font that has just a \"hint\" of celtic design to it. Most of what
  I've seen, i.e. Jana Thork, Libra, Carolina, etc. are too much for what I want.
  Do you have any suggestions?"

    maybe still a bit too much.\r\n\r\nIs there a certain time period that you want
    to invoke, or do you want something more contemporary with a Celtic 'hint'?"
