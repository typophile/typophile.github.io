  that specialised in ancient middle eastern/hebrew etc typefaces. I had noticed the
  guy pulled the site down some time ago, but I thought that he might be coming back...but
  no, so now this great name is available again !\r\n\r\nIt still gets a tonne of
  legacy traffic (about 5000 Unique Visitors/month), so would be a great domain name
  for someone either starting up a new design & typography blog/website, or somebody
  who already has one and is looking for some instant, highly targeted traffic (via
  301/302 redirection).\r\n\r\nCheck it out here:\r\n\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Desi
  ... 911.c0.m14\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPat"
