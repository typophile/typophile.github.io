  body: "bauer comes close but if you notice, the \"a\"'s are more rounded than bauer
    and the \"i\"'s have dot's where bauer does not.\r\n\r\nThe other thread deals
    with same company, but the font they use for that other logo in that thread is
    not the same as this one, Virgin is like the Walmart of company's, putting their
    name on everything from records to fuzzy slippers."
