    wanting to redesign my resumes/invoices/other materials. \r\n\r\nSame reason as
    my previous request for a companion to Centaur, which I'm using currently (alone)...\r\n\r\nThen
    I stumbled upon Dearest...which really suits my personality/illustration style
    perfectly.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and patience, I'm new here.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    180# Winstead, with the 396 also as edging.\r\n"
