body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nFor my portfolio site I will make use of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Formschneider.jpg|a
  woodcut image]]. I want to find a serif typeface that would be historically appropriate
  for it and/or an interesting choice (for whatever reason you find it to be so; but
  please explain that reason). I can't give too much information about the site, but
  I'll just mention this: I plan on designing custom blogs for Protestant Christian
  writers, so a typeface that references the Reformation period (or is in any way
  relevant to the Reformation) would be a bonus.\r\n\r\nRequirements for the typeface:\r\n*
  It must be available as a webfont, preferably through Typekit or Google Webfonts.
  But I'm open to other suggestions as long as I don't have to host the file(s) myself.\r\n*
  It must have both a regular and italic style. (I'll be loading only these two styles
  of the typeface on the page.)\r\n* It must be suitable for both display and text
  use. I know, it's not ideal, but since this is for the web, I can't load too many
  fonts on the same page. However, text size in this case will be somewhere between
  16-20px.\r\n\r\nHere's what I've played with so far. My favorite for the big text
  is Adobe Garamond, but I'm having a hard time making it work at smaller sizes, as
  it looks rather fragile even at 18-20px. (Please check out the links for a full
  view.)\r\n\r\nAdobe Garamond \u2193 [[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10841489/garamond.png|(FULL

  for taking the time to look at this.\r\n\r\nPS - I'll be using a heavy weight of
  Museo Sans Rounded for small text, mostly in all caps. See full images for an example. "

  body: "You have the Minion image twice.\r\n\r\nHow about something a little distressed,
    like Founders Caslon, Old Claude, Celestia Antiqua \u2026 ? (I don't know if these
    are available for web licensing, but you should be able to find something similar.)
    Maybe too much for the text size, but you do specify a rather large text size,
    so it might work. \r\n\r\nIf you like A Garamond, have you tried Garamond Premier?
    What about a Jensen? Or Centaur/Arrighi?\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I see, you've tried
    the Fell type, but it didn't show up in the main post. I really like this choice.
    The question is whether you want to have a kind of sleek, polished aesthetic that
    makes some subtle references to craftsmanship and woodcut style (as in, for instance,
    much of the branding on  [[http://www.lulu.com/publish/?cid=en_tab_publish|Lulu]]),
    or whether you want your own words to embody the spirit of the woodcut. So \u2014
    contrast or concord?"

    VIEW)]]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fell_double_pica_small_4655.png]\r\n\r\nJoshua,
    good thoughts. Re distressed fonts, including the above example: I'm worried about
    rendering (especially on Windows), so I think I'll stick to the more \"polished
    aesthetic\". \r\n\r\nAh, yes. I forgot about Jenson. Thanks for reminding me.
    Garamond Premier is also available on Typekit. Looks to be a bit darker than Adobe
    Garamond. \r\n\r\nOf the examples above, do you find anything particularly appropriate?
    Thanks for the help."

    type highly readable, yet is also suitable for display settings,\" says a [[https://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro|Typekit

    mention): the site will be responsive, so what is a \"display\" use on certain
    devices becomes \"text\" use on others (e.g. smartphones, if I choose to have
    the fonts load there too)."

  body: "Well, of the ones you have, I think Arno works best. Arno is available in
    several optical sizes, but those would probably count as different fonts for your
    purposes. I like it because it references classical renaissance faces, but is
    a bit modern and sleek. It's also not too stylized or flamboyant. \r\n\r\nMinion
    in this context looks to me absolutely like the \"welcome to the exhibition\"
    sign at a museum of printing history. In general, paragraphs of text, set FL in
    a large size of a clean text typeface (and overlaid on a rough, muted illustration)
    feel like museum signage. I think."

    is subtle enough to not hinder legibility at small sizes)."
