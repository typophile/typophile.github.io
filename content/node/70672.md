  body: Judging from the inconsistencies (compare the same letter in different words,
    such as the "e"), I would say these were lettered by hand. Maybe someone else
    will have suggestions of fonts that are similar. I'm not well versed in typefaces
    of these genres.

    as Mark said, the film* being from 1921, they obviously aren't fonts, but hand
    lettering.\r\nThe first images are of some sort of Fraktur, but it's difficult
    to find one with that style of D along that style of T. One I found, albeit less
    elegant than the one shown, is Feder Fraktur (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/feder-fraktur/).\r\nFor
    the last image, you can check, for example, Dafont's \"Foreign look\" theme (http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=201).\r\n\r\n*

  body: Hey thanks Frode! I always kind of liked that font, and occasionally wondered
    what it exactly was. It works perfectly on the screen, even on these 13 pixels
    high characters you can clearly see the difference in weights.
