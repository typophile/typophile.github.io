  much sadness we share the news of Vladimir's death. He passed away peacefully on
  August 6th, at home surrounded by the love and care of friends and family from near
  and far. He used his final energy to express his love and to complete his last painting:
  a large, magnificent canvas of a cherry tree in full bloom. We know how much his
  friendships meant to him. Thank you so much for enriching his life and bringing
  him joy!\r\n\r\nWith love and gratitude,\r\nKyoko, Mariam, and Mona\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur
  dear friend Vladimir was an active participant in (and a founder of) this Arabic
  forum on TPHL! We shall miss his wonderful friendship and talented insights.  Please
  celebrate his life by visiting Vlad's website and exploding his incredible work
  and accomplishments in many fields:\r\nhttp://vladimirtamari.com/index.html\r\n\r\nAlso,
  appreciate his wonderful font addition, designed in the early 1960s and released
  few years ago!\r\nhttps://www.fonts.com/font/alquds-fonts/alquds \r\n\r\n\r\n "
