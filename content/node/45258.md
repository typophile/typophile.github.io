  body: "For some reason I think this looks customized, or else like several fonts
    were mixed. The stemless u and n might have had 'stem-ectomies'. The closest font
    resemblance I can find is the [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts|Chalet
    family]] from House. However, I think there is no k in Chalet that matches the
    one in your sample. That looks more like Futura. I think this may be the reason
    that no one has ID'd this so far (because it isn't one font).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
