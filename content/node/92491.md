  when I adjust the kerning in Kerning Pairs regarding a specific couples in a font,
  the change doesn't apply into the Illustrator file (or InDesign) file where this
  font is in use. I'm designing a Cyrillic font and took into consideration all possible
  Kerning Pairs in the font but these pairs doesn't look properly kerned in Illustrator.
  Do I make something wrong when applying \"Generate Font\" command or should look
  elsewhere.\r\nThank you very much in advance."

    some applications\u2014that your font had to include one other feature besides<strong>
    kern</strong> to get kerning to work."

      you very much.

    font caches for changes to take effect (how this is done will depend on your OS,
    but a google search should provide the necessary info).\r\n\r\nAnd depending on
    how your FL preferences are set, you may need to manually regenerate your kern
    feature from the OpenType menu (available in the OpenType Pane).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    applications programs, you need a substitution feature --  a gsub feature -- before
    the gpos features are applied. liga is, of course, a substitution feature. So
    too is frac (fractions). But capital spacing, for example, is not."

    but with no results so far. Indeed I thank everybody who tried to solve this problem.

  body: After editing the kerning, did you update the Kern Feature via "Kerning Assistance"?

  body: Yes, and when I click the "Ing-Yang" button "No errors found" message appears.
    It's very strange because when I make double check of the adjusted pairs with
    "Kerning Assistance" feature they all appear exactly as I set them. But when I
    switch to Illustrator where I have inserted long copy which is supposed to be
    with this typeface those pairs are still as they're auto kerned and for Cyrillic
    letters this is really awful. Tried dozens of tricks and nothing seems to solve
    the issue.
