body: "You corrupted one of the fonts, Microsoft Sans Serif, Tahoma and tahoma bold.
  You deleted Micross.ttf, Tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf except the font Courier New.
  If you're deleting Courier New, an undefined character will show when Vietnam character
  isn't defined, like an O with horn, shows up the font Courier New rather than Microsoft
  Sans Serif. You deleted tahoma. Pronouncing the word tahoma will be good. Why not
  reinstall the micross.ttf, tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf? So why not add Kerning pairs
  like TA, FA, AV, PA, LT, into Microsoft Sans Serif? Tahoma already had kerning pairs.
  And why not add some kerning pairs like AW, WA, VA, TA, FA, Aw, Ay, AY, etc. to
  Gulim? How add some kerning pairs like AW, AV, TA, PA, WA, VA, YA, AY, Ay, Av, Ta,
  Tc, To, Te, etc. to Batang? And how add some kerning like AV, AW, AY, AT, TA, to
  Lucida Grande? And add all kerning pairs to Lucida Sans Unicode? Segoe UI had kerning
  pairs. Both Tahoma and Verdana has kerning and Microsoft Sans Serif has no kerning
  pairs. You can download the fonts that start with Tahoma. Code 2000 also includes
  239 kerning pairs. You can download Code 2000 from the website. And you noticed
  Microsoft Sans Serif was to include the Oi.\r\n\r\nPlease give me the font files
  for micross.ttf, tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf so you can convert these to Tux Typing
  files!\r\n"

  body: The OP is from Seoul, where a form of spoken Mad Libs called "Type Scat" is
    sweeping the nation. Unfortunately it loses something when translated from the
    original Korean.

  body: "You have the Microsoft Sans Serif font file and a corrupt Tahoma font file,
    then deleted the fonts.\r\n\r\nBut you don't see any Abkhasian. If you copy and
    paste a letter like Ghe stroke, Zhe descender, Shha, Schwa, Barred O, it will
    change the font to Courier New. If you use ctrl backspace, the letter couldn't
    be changed. If you install Microsoft Sans Serif, the font looks good if you copy
    Pe middle hook or any Abkhasian letter, the font will change to Microsoft Sans
    Serif. If you delete the font then restart the computer, Microsoft Sans Serif
    will be unaccessible. If you copy the character, the font changed to a glyph named
    '.notdef', which is also in FontCreator 5.6 Glyph Postscript lists. If you copy
    a letter like O with horn, capital Schwa, U caron, u dieresis macron, A caron,
    A circumflex hook, Combining hook, then the font will change to Courier New, then
    press Ctrl+Backspace, the glyph will be changed to a glyph named '.notdef' and
    another .notdef glyph will appear. If you copy a Hebrew letter, the font is changed
    to Courier New. If you press Ctrl+Backspace, a .notdef glyph will be shown but
    the font shouldn't change for the Hebrew letters to your own font.\r\n\r\nIt's
    why the PS name whitecircle wasn't in the FontCreator PS name list. It's why the
    name whitecircle will become available in the list, like this:\r\n\r\nUdieresis\r\nUgrave\r\nugrave\r\nunderscore\r\nv\r\nV\r\nw\r\nW\r\nwhitecircle\r\n\r\nIt's
    how the PS Names like uni_2120, uni_212F, uni_2137, uni_2136 will become available
    in FontCreator's PS names. But how the PS name smallscriptl will become available
    in FontCreator? You ask Erwin Denissen to make\r\nuni_2120 uni_212F uni_2137 uni_2136
    smallscriptl uni_2223 uni_2228 uni_2227 uni_22BB _2566 _2567 _2568 _2569 _256a
    _256b _256c uni_25C7 become available by replacing Bitstream's glyph table with
    Custom Bitstream's glyph table. You ask Erwin Denissen to make uni_301A uni_301B
    uni_EFBF uni_EFC0 uni_EFC1 uni_EFC2 uni_EFC3 uni_EFC4 uni_EFC5 uni_EFC6 uni_EFC7

    uni_EFD1 uni_EFD2 uni_EFD3 uni_EFD4 to become available in Custom Bitstream's
    glyph table. Asked Erwin Denissen to make uni_EFD5 uni_EFD6 uni_EFD7 uni_EFD8
    uni_EFD9 uni_EFDA uni_EFDB uni_EFDC uni_EFDD uni_EFDE uni_EFDF uni_EFE0 uni_EFE0

    uni_EFFF available in glyphs list with uni_**** and hp****. You think the simple
    glyph Scaron contains 2 contours and 89 points. If you delete the caron, then
    it will change to a letter S. If you delete the 68 points then use Copmlete Composites,
    Scaron will become a composite glyph. The other glyph Racute has 69 points and
    3 contours. The other glyph odblacute has 4 contours and 70 points. If you delete
    the whole glyph and use Complete Composites, then the glyph changes from simple
    to composite. You think the \u0143\u0144\u0147\u0148 were simple. Delete the letter
    and use Complete Composites to complete the selected 4 glyphs: \u0143\u0144\u0147\u0148.
    These are in Unicode and encoded as Latin Extended-A Unicode block. You think
    the 8 glyphs \u0112\u0113\u0116\u0117\u0118\u0119\u011A\u011B were simple. Click
    the letter then use the Delete button to delete the E letter and use Complete
    Composites.\r\n\r\nCopy and paste this to Nimbus Mono if your font is like Courier:\r\n2-7-3-9-2-2-5-2-4-4\r\n\r\nYou
    think the 4 greek letters \u03B6\u03BE\u03C1\u03C5 also have serifs. 4 greek letters
    \u03B6\u03BE\u03C1\u03C5 from Courier New doesn't, but Free Mono still has serifs.\r\n\r\n"
