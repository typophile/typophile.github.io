body: "I have hit an issue I have never had before with InDesign CS3. I have imported
  a Word document and am setting it now. The client had set up his own styles in Word
  which I asked InDesign to ignore. However, I am still hitting this problem; <strong>when
  I select a list and delete his bullets InDesign places a space at the start of the
  line</strong>. This in essence means when I apply my bullets style the alignment
  is off.\r\n\r\nHas anyone any idea? If you need any more info to diagnose let me
  know. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[edited] I have also just realised that it is doing
  it when I copy and paste a selection - for instance I was selecting two numbers
  only, no space before or after, and when pasted InDesign was inserting a space before.
  It is doing it across all documents and is obviously not document specific."

    in Preferences and InDesign appears to have stopped misbehaving. Have I solved
    the problem or created a new one?
