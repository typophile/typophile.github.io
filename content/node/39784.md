    The Font</a> service turned out to be pretty helpful \u2013\_contrary to my expectations
    when it comes to script fonts, by the way. But as this very one is disconnected,
    WTF once more could shine (me being just the intermediary \u2013\_never heard
    of Petras Script before).\r\nJust upload a picture, check/enter the detected characters
    and there you go!"
