    but couldn't find anything. I suspect you could use the term \"letterpress\" and
    anybody who would know what that is would know the English term too. But you might
    contact Jorge directly - he's highly approachable; he teaches at the Universidad
    Iberoamericana in Tijuana. I'm sure he can help you find letterpress printers
    too.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you could do is ask old-timers at newspapers that have
    been around for a while (like at least a few decades) - they're likely to have
    good leads for you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hola Javier, I believe that the name is \"Imprenta de Tipograf\xEDa\" or
    \"Imprenta Tipogr\xE1fica\". The problem I see is that this name in the present
    time is too general, too common becouse of the word \"Tipografia\".\r\n\r\nDe
    todas formas intentalo tambien con estos nombres:\r\nImprenta de Tipos M\xF3viles\r\nImprenta
    de Caracteres M\xF3viles\r\nImprenta de Tipos de Caja\r\n\r\nBuena suerte.\r\n"

  body: "> Imprenta de Tipos M\xF3viles\r\n\r\nI saw that in Jorge book, but it can't
    work, because letterpress isn't necessarily done with movable type. Especially
    now with photopolymer printing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yeah I know I somebody told me about that term \"Imprenta de Tipos M\xF3viles\"
    and the ones Ignacio posted  but I didn't though it was it. Now that you both
    have said it I think I sould just go with it. I guess even though its not movable
    type anymore the name just got stuck...\r\n\r\nI also tried looking into the yellow
    pages from my town and I couldn't find any printer relevant to that \"term\"...maybe
    it died there or the name is just mistaken...\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\n"

    for letterpress in spanish but I've heard of a couple other ones besides the ones
    listed here:\r\n\r\n<cite>Prensa plana</cite>: I've heard this from someone who
    creates custom paper for wedding invites. That's what she calls it.\r\n\r\n<cite>Minerva,
    Minerva tipografica</cite>: I found this through google.\r\n\r\nYou can see some
    HEIDELBERG here:\r\nhttp://www.interempresas.net/Graficas/MercadoDeOcasion/Ofertas/Busca.asp?ID=16\r\n\r\nthey

    me, but they're in Buenos Aires!\r\n\r\nI just found a couple of websites based
    on the updated info you posted:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.museodelaimprenta.com.ar/impresion.asp\"
    target=\"_blank\">Museo Virtual de la Imprenta</a> has some info on different
    types of printing presses, with plenty of images.\r\n\r\nUnos tipos duros has
    a <a href=\"http://www.unostiposduros.com/paginas/tra02b.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tratado
    de tipografia</a> that has some helpul info too.\r\n\r\nI've linked directly to
    the pages with the info, so you don't have to do any searching.  :-) Good luck!"

  body: "kco:\r\n\r\nThe correct terms are imprenta tipografica and prensa plana,
    as someone said, which correspond somewhat\r\nto \"letterpress shop\" \"platen
    press\".\r\n\r\nI have a small (very) letterpress shop in the city (D.F.), dedicated
    to limited editions of poetry,\r\nwhile the most experienced shop I know is called
    Ditoria, and they have been working for almost 15 years.\r\nThey have made some
    20 or 30 fine editions during that time.\r\n\r\nThere is a medium-sized shop with
    a large heidelberg cylindrical that prints wrestling posters\r\nand used to do
    some work for bullfights, not the fancy kind of poster, mind you, in the Colonia
    Obrera.\r\n\r\nOther than than that, small shops use letterpress to number invoices,
    and that is about it.\r\n\r\nThere is also the handpress printer Juan Pascoe in
    Michoacan, and there are some graphic artists\r\nlike Ehrenberg and Magali Lara
    who have made \"artist's books\", as well as Toledo. But I have not seen\r\nexamples
    and cannot be sure if they can be considered letterpress.\r\n\r\nI hope this is
    of some use. Send me a message if I can help you out with anything.\r\n"
