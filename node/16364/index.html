<div class=commentbody>I'm not from where you's fulla's are, and I clearly have less emotional attachment to a Telco's logo. But it is worse, so much more! I think the USATODAY write up says it all:
"AT&T's logo has been rejiggered to give it a 3-D effect."
Imagine adressing a boardroom full of powersuits and selling it with that line! The actual pitch and the USATODAY write-up would be hilarious to read side by side.
"He says the pint-sized letters, reminiscent of alphabet soup, were a tough sell internally"

It still has problems (the type, that 'a' gives me the willies), but that 3-D Sphere of Mesmerizing Technology Swirls is just silly. They should have stuck with the uppercase type. No reason to stop. They're just losing some of the 'burned-in-the-mind' features of the old one.</div>

I think Linotype own the TM so no other cut could use the name.
I think Cingular's brand is all Avenir, which makes the choice all the more/less interesting.

It depends how stern a stuff you are made of, Hector.
Just how many corporate meetings and are you prepared to sit through, how many powerpoint rationales are you willing to give, before your brain turns to mush? Could you make it different, but kind of the same? Sure, give me the money, you want progressive conservative? -- no problem!

<div class=commentbody>I don't think this is lack of good designers, as much as it is influence of the corporate higher ups and what they think is good. I see this at work sometimes (RCA Records) on the American Idol and other things that Clive Davis gets his hands on. The ADs just give up and let him do what he wants with the artwork because it's a never ending battle on certain artists.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, but if they bring the bell back they can have the "ill communication" again. Though the new bell would probably be 3D as well, and have an animated clapper or something.

<div class=commentbody>The real sad part is less about changing AT&T. To me the sad part is losing the Cingular brand mark. Cingular had successfully created a brand avatar that was so much more than a logo. Maybe the "jack" as they called it was a bit too trite, but it had some life to it. This is in the same vein as TiVo, only Cingular executed it better.

By contrast Verizon's new name and especially logo were pitiful. The reputation of their phone service was better though, at least on the East coast. </div>

<div class=commentbody>VSA did the original cingular mark and type which I thought was nice. Then the logo got hi*jacked* and turned into the 3D *person*. Then they added the speech bubbles. Then with the AT&T merger, they changed the colors to orange and blue with bubbles and 3D.
All that to say Cingular was long gone. To be fair I do think they made the right choice about which was the stronger brand: AT&T.

I don't really care for sniping at corporate redesigns. I'm as big of a fan of good design as anyone else. But consider the UPS moves that got talked to death. They have done a beautiful job implementing their new logo IMHO. The put up the bucks to gradiate the tails of every aiplane and patch on every shirt. AT&T will throw enough money at the implementation of this new design that it will also work. This is true of the Verizon abomination. The logo sucks but the brand is strong because of the dollars spent putting it in front of our noses.

<div class=commentbody>The old ampersand was great. Do you remember the ads they ran (about a year ago probably)? The new logotype retains the most memorable features of the mark, but throws out the best typographic feature.
And I like the new Sprint mark a lot. It has a nice sense of motion and balance. It also plays off their pin drop motif without hitting you over the head with it. I regard Sprints new work as some of the best ID work on that scale (with that much nationwide presence).</div>
