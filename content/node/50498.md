  slides that are clear, compelling, and informative.   They can be PowerPoint, Open
  Office, or anything else.  Preferably they would be from real presentations rather
  than samples.\r\n\r\nWhere should I look for really good slides?  Do you have any
  to share?  Post a link to a really good one and I might feature it in my new book.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZack"

    DC area design firms. Many federal agencies and contractors require copies of
    presentations and only accept Powerpoint files. This has created a market for
    good Powerpoint presentations and local designers are all over it."

    DC AIGA.\r\n\r\nWhat if I opened the question up to really good slides from any
    tool?  Does anyone have any presentation slides from any tool that are particularly
    good?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZack"

  body: "Next time in the future get your self a mac and buy an application called
    \"Keynote\". Its better, and cleaner then PowerPoint.\r\n\r\nAs for the layer,
    I would use Helvetica Bold as your font, keep every sentence on the left, and
    align the text. Set the background black and the font white. thats probably the
    most beautiful color combination there is, also you show contrast so it'll be
    easier to read. \r\n\r\nIt'll look good."
