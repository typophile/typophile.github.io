body: I was experimenting with some quick sketch thumbnail's I had made last week.
  Its nothing big, however I had fun throughout the whole process.  The AIDAN (son's
  name) letters were originally drawn with a Copic marker, Its was heavily modified.  Any
  feedback would be great, Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Samples_4162.jpg]
