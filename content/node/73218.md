  body: "Assuming that the type was from 1972 (or earlier) means this is pre-digital,
    and I don't think I've ever seen this in digital form. Not only that, I don't
    think I've seen it in any of my type books. Someone here with a good collection
    of film type books would be your best hope to name this typeface, but I really
    doubt you will find it in digital form.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    wrong, but I still can safely say I have never seen this one. Anybody else?"
