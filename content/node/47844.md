body: So I came across this font a good 3-4 years ago, and I used it in a logo. But
  now I can't find what specific font it is. Below is a picture of a T in this font.
  If anyone could identify it or help me out, that would be great! Also, I'm pretty
  sure this was a free font, but I'm not 100% on that. Again thanks to anyone that
  can help out!
