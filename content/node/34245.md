  in an advertisement for one of my clients. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it would be better
  to use a font that creates that effect, or to create the effect in Photoshop on
  an existing font. \r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions, \r\nR."

    or render in 3-D.\r\nSince this is the Type-ID-board - the font is Albertus ;-)"

  body: "What about the flourishes/ornaments?\r\nIf you want to emboss the entire
    page (as if printed the ol'fashioned way), just a typeface won't be enough. \r\nMaybe
    use Photoshop after all...\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Design the page/ad using Illustrator
    or InDesign; Export to PDF and finaly Import to Photoshop again...(use transparent
    background and a reasonable resolution).\r\nCreate a new layer (filled white),
    Select the layer with text/image and 'clear' the selection layer from the white
    one.\r\nApply some kind of 'embossing effect on this white layer.\r\nPerhaps you
    could bring the 'embossed layer' back into InDesign in order to maintain the quality
    of the type.\r\n"

  body: "You can create a look similar to this in Photoshop, but it'll look far less
    organic. It's pretty simple, though:\r\n\r\n1. Set your type in Photoshop\r\n2.
    Set the layer effects to Bevel and Emboss, and select Emboss and choose down as
    the direction. Adjust the depth and everything until it looks right. Subtlety
    goes a long way here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/faux_emboss_5886.png]"

  body: 'It''s pretty easy to do a simple effect in illustrator. first change the
    transparency of your type to multiply at 100%. then select the type and go to
    effect: stylize: inner glow. set the opacity at 8-10%, change the mode to multiply
    and the color to black. it gives a subtle indented look without the hassle of
    photoshop. '

  body: You could always design with the real letterpress type. There are some sites
    with stock art or you could go to www.woodtypeimage.com the have tons of stuff
    as well as freebies section.

  body: Brad B's well-done tutorial shows sharp ink traps. Before applying these effects,
    you might want to dirty the type up a bit by applying a small-radius Gaussian
    blur, then adjusting the levels to eliminate the gray.

  body: hi, i served an apprenticeship in letterpress hot metal works because of the
    physical pressure of type into paper to try and recreate this you almost need
    a stroke but the subtlty is sublime that is what gives letterpress the edge over
    litho. no easy way , not even thrru photoshop, which as a bitmap prog will never
    be as effective as illustrator, you will have to use  a dark grey, stroke it with
    black but use a mask to keep the integrity of the font, play

  body: "Fred Goudy's fonts were arguably the first to imitate a letterpress effect,
    especially Kennerley (1911).\r\nAlthough he was working with metal type, there
    was sufficient distance, in terms of resolution, between his subject material
    of relatively crude Renaissance text typography, and the large, sharp letters
    he was able to create with refined early 20th century printing technology, to
    allow an objective historical perspective to be expressed in letter details which
    were informed by the trace of process.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Phoenix_6689.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is a display setting of Kennerley from 1920 (you can see from the text show-through).
    Note the blobbyness (in imitation of ink spread) and flex of the serifs, the drastic
    thinning at the joint of \"h\", and the fly-away tittle, after Jenson.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poly_5829.png]\r\n\r\nPoliphilus
    was conceived at Monotype in 1923 as a photographically-engineered simulacrum
    and facsimile-maker of Renaissance typography. \r\n\r\nSo to a certain extent
    such types incorporate in their design the artefacts and effect of letterpress
    printing, in whatever medium they are rendered, be it letterpress, offset, or
    screen.\r\n\r\n"
