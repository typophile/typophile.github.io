It doesn't have to be 1000. In the font you posted it would be 1125 + 375 = 1500. 1500 is not the typical figure, but it will work fine. <BR> <BR>To do this, just go to the Font Info window and check both &quot;Retain path coordinates when changing em square&quot; and &quot;Automatically compute em square from ascent + descent&quot;.

The problem (or at least part of the problem) is that you are drawing the characters far outside the boundaries of your font. The ascent and descent lines are where the topmost and bottommost parts of your characters should normally stop. If you extend parts of characters beyond those limits, they will get clipped off when you use the font in most programs. <BR> <BR>I would suggest spending some time with the Fontographer manual, go through the tutorials, etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matt, is it possible for you to post the Fontographer font file here? (Not the generated TrueType of PostScript font) There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with the way you've set up the font. <BR> <BR>Jim, FontLab uses a different system for curve/line transition points which may make more sense to you. These points can be designated as smooth or not smooth. Smooth gives the same effect as a tangent point in Fontographer when a line a curve meet. The control point of the curve is aligned to the angle of the incoming line keeping the transition between the curve and the line smooth. When the point is set to not smooth, the control point is unconstrained allowing the transition to form a sharp corner. The smooth/not smooth thing works with the transition between curves as well except that it keeps the control points on either side aligned, again creating a smooth transition. This is the same as a &quot;curve point&quot; in Fontographer. <BR> <BR>I sure hope there are other people familiar with Fontographer to help answer some of these Fontographer questions. I switched to FontLab cold turkey over a year ago and would rather forget about Fontographer and all the stupid little tricks you have to learn to use it effectively. FontLab is way better.  <BR> <BR>And Matt, as it seems you are just starting to learn about making fonts, I would suggest using something like FontLab's <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/TypeTool/">TypeTool</a>. It's cheap and easier than FontLab, and you won't be learning to use an obsolete and virtually unsupported program (Fontographer was last updated in <i>1996!</i>). Plus, you can upgrade to FontLab later if you decide you like this sort of thing. Just a friendly suggestion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jim <BR>Fontographer set a default value of 800 for ascent and 200 for descent, so obviously if your font goes beyond this default setting you have to do what Mark has shown you. If you did not comply with the default settings, then the program was a bit unforgiving, causing you to have to check the &quot;automatically compute em square &hellip;&quot; as Mark shows.  <BR> <BR>By the way, I use Type Tool 2 and find it excellent and you can upgrade if you like to FontLab as was pointed out. Further, there are a lot of things about Fontographer that are annoying, lousy manual, etc., but one of the most irritating is what is referred to as &quot;grid spacing.&quot; If you do not select all of the points and then select the &quot;Align Points to Grid&quot; command, you get points without integral numbers; in other words, instead of 120, 66 horizontal and vertical measurements, you will get fractional hundredths, like 120.223, 65.97 (from the manual) measurements. This might sound silly, but it can be problematic. Type Tool automatically does away with decimal percentages like this and effectively snaps to a grid. Mind you, Fontographer was the choice of most for years, so I shouldn't complain too loudly. And, just to add one more thing, &quot;auto spacing,&quot; and &quot;auto kerning&quot; were never a good idea because the results were always lousy. Not to say that I didn't try.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matt, Jim, et al <BR>I opened your file to look. Just a note - as there is some overlapping of forms in a couple of the glyphs of the font, first select all of the points in that particular glyph, then go to the Elements drop down menu, and then select &quot;remove overlap.&quot; This happens when the points actually are directly on top of each other, not when the forms overlap but the points of the forms of the glyph are in different places. Anyway, have fun with this. Font creation is always an adventure.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm. From what you say, it sounds like you're running OS X. There are some issues that affect font developers having to do with the system font cache in OS X. Try giving the font a different font name when you generate the font. It could be that the system has cached a copy of the earlier version and is not showing the new one. <BR> <BR>There is also a utility called Font Finagler which will clear out your font cache if you don't want to change the name. Changing the name is easier, though, since clearing the font cache requires restarting or logging out and back in. <BR> <BR>I don't know for sure that this is what's going on, but it seems likely.</div>
