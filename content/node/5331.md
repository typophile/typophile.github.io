  <BR>Kub was initially design to be a 3D typeface &#40;as a sculpture&#41;. <BR>
  <BR>Now a font, the actual suitcase contains a Regular, light, midtone and shadow
  version, the best result is achieved when the fonts are layered on each other in
  varied tonal value to create a single 3D typeface.  <BR> <BR>AF Kub is part of the
  ACME font library <a href="http://www.acmefonts.net/" target="_blank">www.acmefonts.net/</a>
  and is available to buy at Fontworks <a href="http://www.type.co.uk" target="_blank">www.type.co.uk</a>

    of this design?"

  body: "Hmm\u2026 that's a bunch of fonts that have to be laid over top of each other
    isn't it. I always wonder if those actually <em>sell</em>. On outline version
    would be cool."

  body: "This reminds me of that cool Nofont thing a while back...\r\n\r\n> that\u2019s
    a bunch of fonts that have to be laid over top of each other\r\n\r\nBut how else
    can you get shading Dan? Type3 is dead, Photofonts is bitmaps. But yeah, I <strong>would</strong>
    be curious to find out how these things (FF Primary probably being the least obscure
    example) actually sell...\r\n\r\nAs for the forms:\r\n- Can the \"e\" be improved?
    I think it could get mistaken for an \"o\", especially in some contexts.\r\n-
    I wonder if there's a way to pull apart the \"h\" and \"n\".\r\n- The \"r\" and
    \"u\" are not working.\r\n- Could the \"x\" be less out of character?\r\n- The
    parens looks just like the square brackets.\r\n- I can't tell what the thing between
    the percent and the question is.\r\n- ...\r\nNow I'm actually tired - I'm gonna
    take a break.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: In a way this reminds me of certain graffiti styles - specifically, the way
    strokes can be seen either as 3D volumes (which are purely pictorial) or 2D shapes
    (which are purely symbolic). The balance struck here is pretty cool! Easy to interpret
    as volume or shape, simultaneously even.
