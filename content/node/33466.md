  had to leave to continue her studies in another country, so I've decided it has
  come the time to refresh the identity and change the name.\r\n\r\nThe name I've
  decided to use on last was undu, the reasoning behind it might sound silly but it
  is a reminder on what not to do, in spanish (im from Mexico) to undo hears exactly
  the same as undu, and also when I started to draft over other names this one is
  the one that I think I would like to develop the most. \r\n\r\n\r\nI understand
  this are simple letterforms, I want it to turn into a mark by itself and later attach
  a surname for the divisions which are starting to arise. (TV, print, web). However
  I've got 2 questions. \r\n\r\nFirst: Which of the 3 would you choose, I know 2 is
  to trendy but i added it for comparison purposses.\r\nSecond: If you like 1 or 2
  what font would you suggest to go with it, I was thinking along the lines of mic32
  by t26 or Tarzana by emigre. But im not completely sure those font choices go on
  the spot. \r\n\r\n\r\nSorry for english if any critical mistakes are made during
  this brief writing. \r\n\r\nThanx in advance."

  body: "I like both the name and logos 1 and 3 (you're right; 2 is not quite right).
    I really like how both are quite abstract but not difficult to decipher. Nice
    work! If I had to decide, I'd go with 3; it's a really cool mark, aside from having
    letters within it.\r\n\r\nTo go along with it, some suggestions are <a href=http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html>Bryant
    2</a>, which echoes the simplified letterforms in your logos (although you may
    or may not like the rounded ends)."

  body: 'Thank you auric, im doing some more font research, and trying mix and match.
    while i like bryants simple letterforms I feel the rounded ends do affect the
    relationship. So im gona try to find something more contrasting. Ive been trying
    neutral fonts on pair with the 1 concept and they sime to go well. however im
    still looking for a rather modern sans, that goes with it dont want to be seduced
    by Helvetica this time. However helvetica rounded plays well with last mark but
    its not giving the message I want. I feel it too soft. '

  body: "I think #1 is your best option right now. The recognition of the actual name
    is most effective here, while #3 may be mistaken for just an abstrasct symbol.\r\n\r\nI
    think simple almost always works, so I wouldn't change #1 much. Perhaps try a
    typeface with rounded terminals? But I think the face you choce is the best choice
    for the space.\r\n\r\nThe frame of the logo seems a little tight...I would enlarge
    it by about an 1/8\" of an inch. It seems tight in the upper left corner, especially
    because this is one of two places where the square terminal of the letterform
    approaches the rounded cornder of the frame. Visually, the breathing room around
    the perimeter on the left doesn't seem balanced to the right.\r\n\r\nHey, do me
    a favor...I could use some critique on my logo too - it's in the forum."

  body: "Using the same character for all the letterforms seems like a strong idea
    in and of itself. (<-- see mark to the left of this ;o)\r\n\r\nHave you tried
    using #1 but with just the type all set on one line? \r\n\r\nI like all of these
    ideas, but I'm wondering if they're perhaps a bit too much. Or, maybe you use
    one of them in combination with the UNDU set on one line. One being the wordmark,
    the other being the logo itself.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "well i treid a couple things. I really liked number 3 after a second review
    I feel the rounded square on no1 makes it stiffy however im having second thoughts
    after a discovery, undu3 is a big nosed man witha  mullock. \r\n\r\nNeed help
    here. Tried bryant and it works really well. with no3\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/undufinal_4656.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/undu_3875.jpg]"

  body: 'Ty dave, indeed type looks the same but lighter. I knew too simple to risky
    im gona stick with the concepts 1 and 3 to avoid this. Without the wordmark to
    avoid relating to it.  I bought Bryant and its lovely on headings etc. ill up
    more proofs as are developed. '

  body: "nice...\r\n\r\nyoure lucky with those letters....i like the abstract mark
    where you have joined the letters....it aludes to a ' + ' symbol, although it
    throws up problems of recognising the letters, probably for that reason if it
    was me id go for teh third one along, its simple and i think these shapes could
    be useful, like used for arrows on your website etc..."

  body: "i love the mark too (#3). it really lends itself to multiple applications.
    the one with the \"eye\" does look like a man with a mullett, but i also saw it
    as a bird (which may be fitting, as the eagle is mexico's national symbol). \r\n\r\nlove
    the flow of it...awesome\r\n\r\n-scott"
