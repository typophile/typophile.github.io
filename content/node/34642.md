  body: "The first thing to recognize is that you have two different typefaces in
    your samples. Sample 1 is a Bold Condensed Slab serif like an Egyptian, and Sample
    2 looks like a normal bracketed serif, possibly Cooper or Goudy Catalogue, which
    have angled stress on the C like this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I think 1 is a [[squooshed]] <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/itc_bookman_std_demi/&sample_text=B.S.%2C%20D.C.&sample_size=74">ITC
    Bookman</a>. The serifs give it away.

  body: 2 is definitely Goudy Old Style - bold, I think. But it sure isn't Bookman.
