body: "I'm trying to experiment with the attached wordmark. It's MrsEaves with a slightly
  altered d and lowered dots over the i's. I'm not sure if I've overdone the kerning
  or not though.\r\n\r\nI like the tight spacing, but will it work (as a logo)? Is
  it obvious that it consists of  two separate words?\r\n\r\n\r\n(The Cadillac in
  question is a French d\xE9partement and not a car brand).\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nCouldn't
  get the attachment to stick, so I've uploaded it to Imageshack:\r\nhttp://img137.imageshack.us/my.php?image=logoxd6.png"

  body: Paul, In my humble opinion, the type is too heavy and too tight and, moreover,
    I prefer the original "d" and "i" - You might want to try a another font or two
    and go lighter on the manipulation.

  body: "Thanks, I've lessened the heaviness slightly by going back to the regular
    style. I'm not sure I like it though.\r\n\r\nAre there any \"rules\" governing
    how heavy a wordmark can be? Obviously it's mostly a matter of trusting your gut
    feeling, but is there a metric that can support my decision when my gut fails
    me?"
