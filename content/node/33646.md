body: "Erwin Gothic is a sans-serif font designed to accompany Erwin Text as a headline
  font for use in the local weekly newspaper, The Erwin Record in northeastern Tennessee,
  USA.\r\n\r\nThe design of Erwin Gothic is based on a series of German grotesque
  families from the early 1900s, designed originally by Johannes Wagner and distributed
  originally by Wagner & Schmidt as Wotan (c. 1914?), Lessing, Reichsgrotesk and Edel
  Grotesque; and subsequently reworked and re-released by several foundries under
  these names as well as names such as Annonce Grotesque (c. 1912?), Aurora Grotesk
  (c. 1928), Neue Aurora Grotesk (1964) and Aura. Anzeigen Grotesk (c. 1943) appears
  to be another offspring of these designs.\r\n\r\nThese designs were, in turn, based
  on older 19th century woodtype grotesques. (The German word \"wotan\" translates
  to English as \"wooden\".)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErwinGothicBoldCondIcon_4520.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErwinGothicBoldCondSpec_6410.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  designing Erwin Gothic, I have lengthened the ascenders and descenders somewhat
  for legibility and readability. Erwin Gothic is also cut more deeply than its predecessors,
  resulting in smaller joins from curved strokes to the main stem, deeper ink traps,
  sharper spurs on upper-case \"G\" and lower-case \"b\" and \"q\", and a more crisp
  overal finish. Many characters have been redesigned, and many alternate glyphs are
  included. Notably, a binocular lower-case \"g\" is included, as well as an angled-crossbar
  version of lower-case \"e\"; the bowl of upper-case \"P\" has been enlarged; the
  rounded legs of the upper-case \"K\" and lower-case \"k\" have been straightened.
  Curved-tailed versions of upper-case \"Q\" and \"R\" have been included, as well
  as both the round-sided and straight-sided variants of numeral \"4\" and letters
  \"V\", \"v\", \"W\", \"w\", \"X\", \"x\", \"Y\" and \"y\". In addition, the tail
  of lower-case \"y\" has been smoothed from its previously abrupt angle. A shorter-armed
  lower-case \"r\" is made available, as are variant forms of many punctuation glyphs.
  There is also a less-formal and somewhat unorthodox alternate upper-case \"E\",
  as well as several other additions to the basic design.\r\n\r\nThe finished family
  will ultimately include at least three weights (light, regular and bold) and four
  widths (compressed, condensed, regular and extended), each with a regular set and
  an alternates set in Postscript and TrueType formats; OpenType formats are planned
  for future release. The first version showing here is the bold condensed.\r\n\r\nComments
  and suggestions will be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

    for the alt M,W,N etc though it might riff on the golden-type-esque arts-n-crafts
    references in the serif. \r\n\r\nThe leaky faucet alt r is a no go IMHO.\r\n\r\nR"

    would look good with your Erwin serif. I think it's the softer finish and waisting
    that adds the warmth that would match nicely. This needs more of that and less

    btw. Worth a gander."
