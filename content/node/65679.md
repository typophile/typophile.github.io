body: "I'm working on a typeface which was first a personal project, but I'm now adapting
  it for a client. I originally designed it on a UPM of 2000. However, the client
  needs a Type 1 font for their system. I'm having difficulties with the vertical
  metrics when I test the Type 1, especially in InDesign. \r\n\r\nIt's prefectly fine
  when I export it as OpenType, but with the Type 1 it's as if the whole baseline
  shifts up (or the baseline stays put but the letters shift up, however you look
  at it). This makes all ascenders and caps to extend outside of the text-frame (which
  doesn't happen with the OTF). The cursor and selection box is of the right size,
  but the type is shifted up, so to speak.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that Type 1 originally
  doesn't allow any nodes to extend outside the 2000 and -2000 boundaries, but also
  read on typophile somewhere that the real boundaries are more in the range of 4000.
  As far as I know I've set the vertical metrics correctly, with the help of the how-to
  on typophile and the pdf that is floating around made by Karsten L\xFCcke.\r\n\r\nIt's
  possible that a 2000 UPM doesn't work, and that I need to scale it. Is there a good
  way to do this without too much nodes rounding of very crudely? Scaling to 1000
  with the 'scale all glyphs...' option checked does cause quite a bit of rounding
  off changes.\r\n\r\nOr maybe there are other tips you guys can give me?"

    in the first place?

    I was not planning on exporting it as Type 1, but now I am forced to.

  body: "Strangely enough, when exporting the Type 1, the Font BBox gets scaled down
    automatically to some random numbers, even when 'Use WinAscent and WinDescent
    as font vertical size' is ticked on in the PostScript-specific Settings. \r\n\r\nI
    tried exporting with the Type 1 Export Terminal this time, and manually changed
    the BBox numbers to the ones that are shown in Key Dimensions (on the bottom).
    Tested the font in InDesign, and the glyphs are now back onto the baseline and
    nothing extends outside of the bounding box (apart from characters like \xC2,
    but that is obvious).\r\n\r\nI have no idea why it changes the BBox size to something
    completely wrong on itself..."

  body: "Well, apparently exporting Type 1 automatically assumes the typeface is on
    a UPM of 1000. As a consequence, everything in my typeface gets halved. Font metrics,
    but also kerning.\r\n\r\nIs there anyone that knows how I can prevent FontLab
    from doing this? Or perhaps knows about another way that I can generate a Type
    1 without everything getting halved?\r\n\r\nOr if that is not possible, how I
    can scale down the UPM to 1000, without getting too much rounding errors?\r\n\r\nOn
    a sidenote: strangely enough the font does display correctly in InDesign. For
    example, it says kerning between L en Y is -90, but it displays it as -180. If
    I reopen the exported font in FontLab, it says -180 again (while the afm clearly
    says -90). I have no idea how exactly this works. It seems weird."

    it's the renderer in a given SW. That would be why InDesign\r\ndoes it right while
    other apps don't.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure because I've always stuck with 1000 (for
    PS) to be safe...  :-/\r\nIt's probably worth going to the trouble fixing everything

  body: "Well, everything in the .afm file is scaled down to 50%. I don't know if
    FontLab does this, but <em>something</em> does. It scales all values to 50%, but
    the glyph shapes themselves are larger than this, so I could see how this is problematic.
    I.e. The cap A is 1450 high and 1512 wide. But the afm shows it as 741 or something
    like that.\r\n\r\nThe font will be used in CCI (newspaper software), which is
    rather deprecated and weird software, so I'm trying to get it right so CCI will
    display everything correctly. They told me that the font prints properly, but
    that the screen display is showing squashed glyphs (the glyphs are compressed
    so that it almost looks like a condensed font). I thought this was caused by the
    scaled down BBox, but after that I noticed <em>everything</em> is scaled down,
    not only the BBox but also the metrics, kerning and the glyhs themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, I will also be sticking with UPM of 1000 from now on. But as I said, I was
    only planning for it to be for my own use, so OT or TTF only, and for those a
    UPM of 2000 is fine. But then someone decided to use the typeface, to which I
    obviously wouldn't object but for which did not plan, and they need Type 1 for
    CCI. ;)"

    think the official recommendation is 1000 (as it uses postscript outlines), but
    not a requirement, as OTF fonts work perfectly fine at 2000. And at seemingly
    random sizes as well, if I'm not mistaken."

  body: "Thanks CurveDoctor. I knew about the 1000 UPM requirement, but not that FontLab
    <em>will</em> automatically scale all vertical metrics to 50% when you export
    Type 1, but just leaves everything else at the original size. This will obviously
    cause problems, as the original size glyphs won't fit into the halved vertical
    metrics / BBox. It would be more workable if FontLab tells you a UPM of 2000 isn't
    supported when you export Type 1, and that it will auto scale everything when
    you proceed. Now it tells you nothing, and just scale down the vertical metrics
    but leave the UPM at 2000.\r\n\r\nNow that I know all this, it isn't longer a
    problem and I just check everything by hand.\r\n\r\nThis thread is basically me
    completely not understanding at all. I should have done some more research before
    starting it. But perhaps it can be of use to someone else having the same lack
    of understanding in the future. :)"
