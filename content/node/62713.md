  share of time browsing my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Writing-Systems-Peter-Daniels/dp/0195079930\">Daniels
  and Bright</a>, and looking through Unicode code charts.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm thinking
  it might be a fun project to do a real font for one. The purpose of this post is
  to explore whether anyone out there is wishing for a font for an underserved script.
  What I'd most like to do is something like Jim Rimmer's <a href=\"www.p22.com/RTF/canadiansyllabics.html\">Canadian
  Syllabics</a>, applying a calligraphic style where previous fonts are much cruder.
  I was also reminded by the recent thread on <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/49264\">Georgian
  fonts</a>, although it looks like there are beautiful fonts available.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nSome
  of the scripts that look appealing to me include <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/phagspa.htm\">Phags-pa</a>
  (for which I have some rare early 20th Century French samples), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmanya_script\">Osmanya</a>,
  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh\">Tifinagh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese.htm\">Burmese
  script</a>, or maybe one of the Phillipine scripts such as <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hanunoo.htm\">Hanunoo</a>.\r\n\r\nIs
  there anyone out there desperately wishing for such a font? Maybe considering producing
  a book in it? I'd likely make it available under a free license, so it could be
  included in Linux distributions among other things.\r\n"

    and have failed. I have tried using extenders and other styles from other scripts.
    None of the styles I have come up with works. I would like to have a nice free
    Osmanya font as most are very crude.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you know, can you show me
    how to make a new keyboard layout for Linux? I'm tired of using gnome character
    map to write Osmanya."
