body: "After almost seven years of putting it off the time has finally come to assemble
  a portfolio and stationary etc. Over the last few months I've been looking at a
  number of typefaces to use for 'branding' myself so to speak and have almost certainly
  settled on Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed Light and Regular. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things
  I love \u2013\r\n\r\n<li>The vertical sides to the C, D, G, O and Q characters.</li>\r\n<li>It's
  subtly square\u2013ish appearance (for example the bowl on the P and R characters).</li>\r\n<li>The
  straight diagonal leg of the R character.</li>\r\n<li>It's history and heritage.</li>\r\n<li>I
  love condensed fonts.</li>\r\n<li>It is very utilitarian and simple.</li><ul>\r\n\r\nThe
  things I do not love \u2013\r\n\r\n<ul> <li>The inconsistencies between weights
  \u2013 between light/regular and medium upwards, some of the characters change completely
  (B, J, K, Q, R at first glance)</li>\r\n<li>For a personal project it's pretty expensive
  (You can't buy individual weights).</li></ul> \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, I just
  want to make sure I'm not overlooking any alternatives. I've looked at Tungsten
  and Knockout from H+FJ, Univers Condensed, DIN, Trump Gothic by Canada Type \u2013
  all of which have some aspects that I love, but there is usually something I really
  don't like also. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/akzidenz_6225.png]"
