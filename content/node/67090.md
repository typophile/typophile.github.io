  body: "Cze\u015B\u0107 Jan,\r\nthis is one of those special typefaces for cartography.
    They used to have pretty generic names, like \u2018Kartenschrift\u2019 [map type].
    Hard to find samples.\r\nYour best option might be <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/roemisch_com_stehend/?&sample_text=Jungfrau&sample_size=74&update=0\">R\xF6misch
    Stehend</a>. Karten-Augustea is also very close, but it seems to be unavailable.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, you might enjoy <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2524903281/\">this
    g</a> aswell.\r\nF"

  body: "Hallo Florian!\r\nThank you very much.\r\nI found this thread helpfull: www.typophile.com/node/54634\r\nBerthold's
    Karten-Augustea could be [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/59825996@N00/3110505654/|here]]
    \r\nAlso Uli tips off forgery of Karten-Augustea, so the font was digitised (by
    Berthold?).\r\n\r\nThis hand-made \"Ausgang.\" is beautifull!\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJan

    3084 Wabern looks a bit different than Karten-Augustea. We need to look at Berthold's
    fotosatz specimen. Is there anybody here?\r\n\r\nRegards - Jan \u017Burawski"
