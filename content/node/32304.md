  of full time employment, the time has come to wreck the ol' Visa with a massive
  font purchase.\r\n\r\nMy plan?  To purchase FontShop's Top 100 (as well as few more
  esoteric choices).  So my question is; what is the best/cheapest way to buy the
  Top 100?  Are their any collections that will get some of the job done at a discount?\r\n\r\n"

    with just Fontshop? Why not put together a nice list of typefaces from various
    foundries and then work your way throught bit by bit... I agree FontShop is a
    good start but they don't have ALL the goodies.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: I just saw that fontshop Germany deal today, perfect timing, however I'm imperfectly
    a US citizen.  I agree that putting together my own top 10 list in an excellent
    idea, the only thing I'm afraid of is buying 10 or 20 fonts separately when I
    could of purchased 50 for the same price as some kind of bundled collection.

    if you buy a bundle of 50 fonts, of which you end up using only 5 because the

    <em>always</em> contain deadwood and also-rans. How else to get rid of the inventory?
    Far better that you build the library of what you think is truly terrific, one
    face at a time if need be.\r\n\r\n(shameless plug) Fontshops version is a good
    one, but is not the only <a href=\"http://www.100types.com\">list of top 100 typefaces.</a>\r\n\r\nI
