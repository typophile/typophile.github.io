  body: Looks hand-drawn as all repeating letters are different (3 different /a, 2
    different /e). Agree also with Kevin, very "Bookman Italic with swash". Another
    good option for this one is Mark Simonson [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania|Bookmania]].
    You may also be interested in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/scrubby|Scrubby]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/keightley-ryan/butternut|Butternut]], less
    clean and maybe a bit vintage/rough/hand-drawn.
