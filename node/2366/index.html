  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m creating a Estonian avation information webpage called &#39;Tallie&#39; &#40;the title might change&#41;, which offers information about international civilian and mil aircraft, texts about history, info about local companies and so on. <BR> <BR>Anyway, at first I was thinking about a logotype with similar motive to Boeing&#39;s logotype, but when developing one I got another idea- a logotype that symbolises the middle window of a commercial aircraft, which has a view to the wing. Here is the first version of it. <BR> <BR>Feedback about comosition, typography and logotype is welcome. <BR>I will probably post the more Boeing-like motive later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. my problem is that somehow on first sight it feels as if the wing-pictogram &#40;which also reminds me a bit of a runway, which ain&#39;t a bad double-association, I think... but maybe you should make the wing graphically more recognizable&#41; belongs to the typo, which makes me read Atallie or Ntallie.  <BR> <BR>Other than that, perhaps a less overused typeface would be nice, just for fun&#39;s sake. Apart from that, the letters could do with a bit of manual kerning, especially t and a and the lli.  <BR> <BR>The window-idea is very very nice, almost too smart for an aviation company :-D. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the nice feedback. <BR> <BR>Actually I&#39;m having double thoughts about this symbol, because it relates more to the commercial aircrafts than military ones, and that is not right because of the information database&#39;s content. Since I didn&#39;t make the &#34;wing&#34; that recognisable, it also works as a silhouette of rear wing. I don&#39;t know if this double meaning is good or not. Well, triple meaning, since it really works as runaway too! <BR> <BR>Concept definitely needs more work and luckily I have you guys <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is nice. I alway like to sit next to the wing when I fly, and look out the window in amazement that we are actually flying. But I love to travel.  <BR> <BR>I would say if your rounded the ends of the wing a bit, it might be a little more &#34;wing-like&#34;. Also, the type seems too big for this size of a mark.

		<div class="commentbody">The type is still visually too bit. I think the reason is &#40;1&#41; the type is darker than the mark, &#40;2&#41; the thinnest space in mark is thinner than the type. Yes, that is a matter of opinion, but I think you will find that going one weight down will help. I might also consider aligment. Should it be a the &#34;visual&#34; bottom of the mark? Or, should it line up with the &#34;actual&#34; bottom of the mark?</div>

Have you thought of any ways to make it more obvious? The most apparent visual seems to be the rear wing. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing. <BR> <BR>I agree with Tiffany 100%.

Wouldn&#39;t it be more effective to make the window and wing more realistic - moving clouds &#40;blue sky&#41; through the window? think Netscape icon - introduce some action - passing jet trail? <BR>How about placing window over name&#62; <BR> <BR>cheers, charley </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree. Iconic forms that are learned or open to multiple interpretations &#40;for example: I saw a tailfin first&#41; are more likely to be remembered. A good graphic symbol should be as simple as possible without being so abstract that it has no meaning. I think this it still makes sense as is--adding clouds or vapour trails would just muddy it up. <BR> <BR>To add more of a wing flavour, couldn&#39;t you perhaps add flaps or some other distinctive wing features? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I will post some mark studies later. <BR> <BR>I think I will skip the frame part and just make the silhouette more wing-like. This will probably weaken the window concept, but in that case it has meaning on two levels - a wing, or a wing seen through window - and not two separate meanings. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the great feedback everybody. I really learn a lot in Typophile forums and I will definitely continue to bug you in the future too <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, here is the flipped version. I didn&#39;t change anything else yet. <BR> <BR>Do you people think that I would be making a mistake when I leave the mark&#39;s meaning open and don&#39;t add any details? I know what I said about the concept in the beginning, but now I&#39;m thinking that if the mark is more general, then it suits the project much more. In its current state a pilot might see the mark as a tail fin or runway and a passanger might recognise the view to the wing. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22333.jpg" alt=""></div>
