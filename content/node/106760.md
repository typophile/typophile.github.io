  the kerning between the two? There\u2019s 6000 pairs in both master weights."

  body: Sounds like a trick question... but I drew both weights in FL. Then built
    the groups in MeMa and kerned both weights there. Copied all groups and OT kern
    data to FL. Exported the UFO to Superpolator, where I generated an instance to
    notice the OT kerns were not right.

  body: "No trick question intended ;)\r\n\r\nPerhaps try to save the kerning from
    MetricsMachine directly into the UFO (as a kern feature) which you then open in
    Superpolator. It\u2019s really hard to get the kerning from MetricsMachine into
    FontLab accurately and completely. So try to avoid going through FontLab a second
    time.\r\n\r\nFontLab \u2192 UFO \u2192 MetricsMachine \u2192 UFO \u2192 Superpolator"

  body: Thanks Jens, I'll try this. But isn't the data in MeMa UFO just similar OT
    kern feature code? Do you know if the master's pairs have to be identical? To
    reduce the number of pairs, I've decided to leave the zero kern pairs out.

    file to FL. Nice workflow! \r\n"

    think they are similar, but FontLab will not work well with kern feature code
    that is copied into its OpenType panel. It is likely to get removed or replaced
    with kerning data from its Metrics window (which may contain no kerning data,
    resulting in an empty kern feature) when generating fonts or exporting to UFO."

  body: "It is possible to work with OT kern feature data from Metrics Machine in
    FontLab if you have pasted it into the OT window in FontLab if you say \"no\"
    to any attempt by FontLab to \"update\" the kern feature (it always asks first).\r\n\r\nA
    better way is to use an \"include\" statement in the lower right pane of FontLab's
    OT window linked to an external text file containing the kern feature from Metrics
    Machine. That way, even if FontLab \"updates\" the kern feature, it won't do any
    harm. You can just delete it."

    this case, I've got two feature files, \"common.fea\" and \"italic.fea\" because
    there are some exceptions with the italic styles. I also have a \"roman.fea\"
    for the romans. The \"../../\" is because the feature files happen to be two folder
    levels up from the .vfb files. \r\n\r\nThe same thing works with kerning feature
    files from Metrics Machine."
