  from using their new logo which to me looks like a bunch of bananas or some other
  produce formed into a W.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/technology/biz-tech/apple-claims-woolies-is-getting-fresh-with-new-logo-20091004-ghxe.html\r\n\r\nI
  live in Australia and see the W logo everywhere and I am a fan of it, I have never
  ever thought of an Apple let alone Apple the electronics company when I have viewed
  this new logo.\r\n\r\nI mean the logo does not share any aesthetic qualities compared
  to the Apple logo in terms of color/style although there is a tiny outside resemblance
  of an outside shape of an apple and one that is not near the shape of Apples.\r\n\r\nI
  mean how much overkill can a company go to stop another unrelated company from using
  a logo? Is someone employed at Apple to view logos all day to ensure no one goes
  near their brand? \r\n\r\nI mean if Apple gets there way you may as well not even
  think about designing logos anymore, I see logos that look like other ones all the
  time and look a whole lot more alike than the Apple Woolworth W!\r\n\r\nHeck why
  doesn't the creator of Pacman sue the pants off LG for using the pacman shape in
  it's logo!\r\n\r\nhttp://en.akihabaranews.com/36529/misc/pac-man-hidden-in-lg-logo\r\n\r\n\r\nTalk
  about Apple turning into the new Microsoft.\r\n\r\nJust wondering what others thoughts
  are on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This story seems to be from October of last year. Is this in the news again,
    or just posted to pile onto the current Apple backlash? \r\n\r\nA quick Web search
    reveals that Woolies TM application permits using the logo on electronic devices.
    Slap this bad boy on the back of a store-brand netbook, Android powered Slate,
    or MP3 player (esp if they make it gray) and you can see why Apple is crying foul.
    \r\n\r\n>Talk about Apple turning into the new Microsoft.\r\n\r\nI don't recall
    a similar logo dispute involving MSFT?   \r\n\r\n"

    a connection to the Apple logo if it was on groceries, but AppleInsider.com says:
    \"Woolworths' application asked for a blanket trademark extending even to electrical
    goods and technology\".  So if they had the right to put it on an electronic item,
    I could see why Apple might care."

    mac logo all day...\r\n\r\nBut seriously, appl is probably just suing to say that
    they didn't have any instances of not defending their trademark."

    to Apples apparent need and greed for world domination of late, like the no flash
    allowed on Iphone issue, just reminds me on Micro$oft back in the 90's trying
    to monopolize everything."

    or northern spy.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of the Woolworths logo to the Mac logo
    is slight and they are less confusable than the Honda & Hyundai \"H\" logos by
    far, The idea that Apple is within it's the rights to trademark not just their
    particular illustration of an apple but an entire species of fruit is just absurd. "
