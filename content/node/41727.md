  body: "I like it! It instantly reminded me of water or something maritime. That's
    due to the tilde I guess. The italic subheading adds nicely to that illusion.
    If you choose a blueish colour scheme for your final version, the illusion is
    perfect.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Designer Hamburg]]"

  body: "Norwegian! Neutraface is an excellent choice. I'd probably set the tagline
    without those swashes though \u2013 as of now it's drawing to much attention to
    itself in my opinion. Also, depending on the final size, Farnham Regular might
    work better."

  body: "It's very beautiful. Great work!\r\n\r\nJust one observation: for instances
    where the mark appears in relatively smaller sizes, you may need to rework the
    relation between the logo and the descriptor to make the latter bigger."

  body: "Cheers guys. Thanks for adding the link picard102 :)\r\n\r\nI'll have a think
    about the issue with small sizes.\r\n\r\nHowever, i've tried to use the \"tagline\"
    with farnham regular, but it gives no contrast to the wordtype and they are both
    very stable, so\r\ni think it added an intresting contrast having the tagline
    in italic and swash."

  body: "It's a very nice and simple wordmark.  \r\n\r\nI think you should look at
    the overall weights of the letters and possibly re-draw some of them to harmonize
    better.  The A and V stand out to me right away as having stroke weights that
    are too thin in comparison to, say, the R and the L."
