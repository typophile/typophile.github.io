  google and other forums but they only mentioned the publication typeface that is
  used.\r\nThe closest fonts that i've tested out are Times and Baskerville Old Face.
  Anyone who did variations of this ad before care to enlighten?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    appeared in 1984, so the typeface was pre-digital. \r\n\r\nIt appears to be some
    form of Baskerville, but I haven't found a match yet.\r\n\r\nHere are some links

      off.

  body: "All I know is that _The Economist_ has a long history of bespoke typefaces.
    Some such as the Officina Display used on the cover were under limited term exclusive
    license. Others, such as this one seems to be, may not have been released for
    public sale. You might ask _The Economist_ for information on the ad series typeface.\r\nDon"

  body: "The answer? http://www.economist.com/help/about-us\r\n<blockquote>Our logo\r\nThe
    corporate logotype of The Economist has evolved from the gothic lettering used
    on the cover of the first issue, published in 1843, to the box device designed
    in 1959 by Reynolds Stone, a British engraver and typographer. It now incorporates
    a font from The Economist Typefamily, a typeface created specifically for our
    use.\r\n\r\nMore details on The Economist typeface\r\nThe Economist has used a
    specially designed family of typefaces since May 1991. Development work focused
    specifically on how the new type family would respond to electronic transmission
    and different printing conditions at The Economist's seven international production
    sites. In our recent re-design a new typeface, Officina, was introduced for cover
    headlines and all navigational information. <strong>Ecotype</strong>, The Economist's
    main typeface, was also redrawn to make it easier to read. If you would like to
    buy a copy of our type family, or if you would simply like to find out more about
    it, please go to Agfa Monotype's website.</blockquote>"

    Unfortunately none of them mention the typeface used by David Abbott. So the question
    remains unanswered.\r\nDon"
