body: "Not strictly a type question (in fact not really at all) but I've got a series
  of 6x6 cards going to print, and yet again it's a project that was abandoned (perhaps
  wisely) by a previous designer.\r\n\r\nEach card is black, with white type and a
  photograph taking up most of the design. After a bit of research here, and despite
  some variation of opinion I've settled on a deep black using CMYK (30,30,30,100)
  - No problem there, but unfortunately, the photos are of objects shot on a black
  background. The photographs are also in CMYK, but the blacks do not even come close
  to matching. I'm trying to find an elegant solution here, as there are 8 different
  cards and 4 posters all using the same source files. In my mind I can think of 2
  options:\r\n\r\n1. clipping mask around my objects (super time consuming)\r\n2.
  setup the backgrounds in the cards to match the images (some nasty 84,72,75,95 concoction)
  and let the printer sort it out (I really don't want to this)\r\n\r\nTo add insult
  to injury the black in each photo is different, so even if I went with option 2,
  the printer would likely have to adjust differently for each card.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  ideas?"

    the card+bleed, rather than an image on top of a black background? The one with
    the brush doesn't /look/ like it would be too hard since it's just pure black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    mixture across the cards.\r\n\r\nbrush no. 1 there, the Background is (82,74,73,95)
    \r\nwhile brush no. 2 is (75,68,76,90)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you could get the black selected you could use a Channel Mixer adjustment
    layer in PS to get where you want to go. Or could float the layer and delete the
    black info then put it on your rich black background. Depending on the source
    material and how good of a selection you can make (Color Range being the first
    thing I would try) one of these methods will work quite well. If it's a good enough
    selection I would probably use solution #2.\r\n\r\nLooks to me on this example
    you could get a pretty good selection using Color Range to select the black then
    deleting the black background.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\npbc"

    probably from the conversions or lack thereof.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "75,68,67,90 - Ah, you are correct - is this the default conversion to CMYK
    from RGB (0,0,0)? If so, how can this help (please excuse my ignorance on this
    one)?\r\n\r\nAlso, after a bit more digging, only the first image is anything
    other than (75,68,67,90) - I have not yet found the source files for these CMYK
    images, and doubt that I will - but if I did and they are likely RGB - what would
    be my best course from there?"

  body: "For What It's Worth:\r\n\r\nYou might try determining a target rich black
    that is a good compromise of all the backgrounds, then use Image > Adjustments
    > Selective Color\u2026  on the Blacks to try to push each of them toward a single
    target. Keep an eye on the Info palette with your cursor in a variety of edge
    locations. Using Method=Absolute will move values more quickly. Depending upon
    the image, Selective Color should stick pretty much to your background, but keep
    an eye on any shadows or dark neutrals just in case. \r\n\r\nYou're not likely
    to be able to get to your ideal 30.30.30.100, but you could get the images close
    to each other. Then you might stand a chance of using the compromise rich black
    build as a background and get them all to be cohesive.\r\n\r\nMight work.\r\n\r\n--

    have exactly what you expect. Make a close cut of the object, keep a small feather,
    save it as a psd file and paste it over a black color you will choose in your
    page layout software (Indesign works well with psd file). '
