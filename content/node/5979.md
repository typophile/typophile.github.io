  body: 'I think most of it is based on Harrington &#40;a.k.a Hermosa&#41;. It&#39;s
    an old Art Nouveau era design that Microsoft and Richard Beatty &#40;and probably
    Scriptorium&#41; have digitized. I can probably find a link for one of them. <BR>
    <BR>Only the looping &#39;l&#39; looks really new, and the crescent dot on the
    i. The &#39;a&#39; has been truncated to remove the serif, so it didn&#39;t clash
    with the r, and a tail has been added to the e in an attempt to make it connect
    with the &#39;r&#39;. '

  body: I found the Scriptorium version. It is called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/rossetti/"
    target="_blank">Rossetti</a>. I also found the Identifont page on <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?1ND"
    target="_blank">Harrington</a>. I got my copy of Harrington in a Microsoft TrueType
    Master Set for Macintosh in 1994.
