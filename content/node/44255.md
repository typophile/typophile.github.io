body: "I'm hoping some of you might have some movie credit advice you'd be willing
  to impart. Essentially, I'd like to  know what a typical point size for crawling
  credits might be, and how it might transfer to the big screen. I've seen some nasty
  typographic accidents in local film and I'd like to avoid making these mistakes.
  \ \r\n\r\n\r\nA colleague I'm working with is concerned that if I make the text
  too small, viewers on the web/youtube may not be able to read the credits and general
  motion type - however, I'm worried the text will look clumsy or horsey when viewed
  on a larger screen. I know this seems to be a case of poor planning - I know we
  should have taken into account the multiple contexts but this doesn't really work
  with our time and budget constraints. I tried to explain to the director that when
  we scale things up in print we have to readjust the type and imagery in regards
  to the new format, etc., but I don't think I'm getting my point across and I need
  to find a happy medium here. \r\n\r\nHelp for a first-timer? "

    reading distance. I can tell you the exact numbers when I get home and check a
    book.\r\n\r\nI don't know typical movie font sizes."

  body: You're designing for a medium that can be of various physical sizes and various
    resolutions. Alas, there's no blanket answer for your other than 'make it as big
    as you can to accommodate the lowest common denominator...likely YouTube'

  body: "A bit late...\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is probably based more on things
    like signs than movie credits, but it should give you an idea. The text should
    be the sum of 1/600 of the viewing distance and 7.2pt (good vision and lighting)
    to 21.6pt (bad eyesight or lighting).\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't look right, tell
    me, and I'll check in more depth; I slightly simplified what I read."
