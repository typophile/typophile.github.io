  I think this might be my first post.\r\n\r\nI did a search and there are a lot of
  other threads people have posted requesting what one font looks good with Chronicle,
  for example, but I couldn't find a thread dedicated to fonts that work well with
  each other. What are your favorite pairs?"

    for H&FJ font pairings, I think they do an excellent job showing how nicely their
    typefaces play together.\r\n\r\nI usually have luck searching a specific face
    to find out about pairings."
