  appreciation for the intricacies of the letter forms that make up a typeface.\r\n\r\nThe
  assignment was to create an upper and lowercase 27th letter of the western alphabet.
  The focus is on the stress, stroke, and serif of each individual letter, all of
  which contribute to the overall look, personality, and readability of the typeface.\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface used was Times STD."

    Yes, I agree with jasonc, it looks italicized. Thank you for your comments!\r\n\r\n@Mill
    .. we were thinking of iev, like a russian. I wish we could upload a sound file,
    it would be so much easier to explain!\r\n\r\nThank you again!\r\n"
