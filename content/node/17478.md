body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently started working as a typesetter on study guides for
  insurance exams. I am working mostly with pre-set styles, but there is a lot of
  tweaking needed to make the formatting right.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems I am having
  is with bulleted lists.  There is already a style set up for the right bulleted
  list.\r\n\r\nHowever, in these bulleted lists are also sub lists with en dashes.
  \ I cannot make the rest of the paragraph indent properly.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\no
  Item one\r\no Item two\r\n  - for example the second line\r\n  does not line up
  with the 1st line indent.\r\n\r\no Item one\r\n  - Does anyone know how to make
  the \r\n    rest of the paragraph indent.\r\n\r\nAlso if there is a way to set a
  style for these en dash - sub-points please let me know.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows
  any good resources especially to do with hanging indents, setting tabs, and lists
  in Indesign CS I would be grateful.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here's a quick-and-dirty way to line up the second line:\r\n\r\nPlace your
    text insertion point after the space (after the bullet) and do command-\\ (Mac).
    Note: The subsequent lines must be part of the same paragraph, so if you force
    a line break, be sure it is a soft line break (shift-return).\r\n\r\nThe same
    thing works in Quark--Adobe copied it from them.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a way
    to make this part of a style sheet, but I'm not sure off the top of my head."

  body: "For future reference, to make this part of a style, in nested styles you
    can choose \"[indent to here]\" in the character drop-down.\r\n\r\nFor my money
    the indent-to-here character is even better than a hanging indent, since it turns
    a set of regular tabs into an indent grid without needing more than one or two
    styles."

  body: "I thought the standard technique was to set up your styles:\r\n\r\n1st level
    bullet:\r\nLeft indent 5mm\r\nFirst line indent -5mm\r\n\r\n2nd level bullet:\r\nLeft
    indent 10mm\r\nFirst line indent -5mm\r\n\r\nThen start each bulleted item with
    the bullet character followed by a tab character which will automatically indent
    to the value of your left indent. You don't need to set tab positions in the styles.\r\n\r\nAFAIK
    this works in Quark, Indesign, Word"

  body: "The main advantage of that way (over the \"Indent to Here\" method) is that
    it gives you better control over the space between the bullet and the text. It's
    smarter but takes a bit more work. I find I use the \"Indent to Here\" more frequently
    because it's so simple to do.\r\n\r\n(I just remembered that Quark was not the
    first to use this idea. A Compugraphic typesetting machine I worked with in the
    early eighties had a feature that functioned the same way. There was a special
    character code that could be inserted in a line. Subsequent lines would indent
    to that spot.)"

  body: "Just for argument's sake, here's three bulletted list paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIn
    the first and second paragraphs, the bullet is separated from the following text
    by a tab. In the third paragraph, the bullet is separated from the following text
    by a wordspace.\r\n\r\nIn the first paragraph, the hanging indent is accomplished
    by a paragraph indent and a first-line outdent. In the second and third paragraphs,
    the hang is accomplished with an indent-to-here character before the first character
    of Text.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3bulls1.gif]\r\n\r\nObviously,
    the tab gives you more control over the amount of space between bullet and text.
    And at this point, you've made the compositors' job very simple\u2014all they
    have to do is put a tab between the bullet and the text, and they don't have to
    worry about any finnicky hidden characters. Unfortunately, look what happens when
    some nutcase gets ahold of it and starts using text wrapping:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3bulls2.gif]\r\n\r\nYou'll
    notice the space+indent-to-here character combo maintains its formatting quite
    nicely, while the tabs and indents get demolished."

    as well as Quark) you can create a nice wide space from bullet to text, you can
    also use double or triple word spaces but that smacks of the amateur.\r\nTim"
