It's the first Latin sans I've attempted that's not a heavily geometric construction, so any input would be great. I was trying to throw some slight corners into certain characters (o, e, c, etc.) to open up the counters a bit. And have been playing with small flares and tapers on various letters. Not sure if either one is working to anyone's great satisfcation. &quot;vent&quot; is just a detail - and Ardbeg is just a whisky - the face is nameless as of yet.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestions fellas. I wouldn't've thought to add some contrast to &quot;v&quot; et al, but I think it's working well. I still need to shave some weight from the &quot;x&quot;, but otherwise they're fitting in much better as far as color goes.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And I shortened the descenders a bit (thanks for pointing that out, Eduardo) - I hadn't even noticed how incredibly long they were. The &quot;g&quot; still needs a lot of work. When I shortened the descenders, I redrew it with the Beziers to bring it in line, but I think I really need to rework it on paper. It seems too light and perhaps too narrow all the sudden.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Oh yeah, I also fiddled some more with the terminal flares and notches at som eof the joints. I moved the top notch on &quot;p&quot; because the top joint is already tapered - it seemed more logical to trim the bottom joint. And I took a nibble out of the shoulders of &quot;m&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incidentally, the cyan is the first version, the black is the revision.

		<div class="commentbody">Seeing your text setting, I am excited that this promises to be a very readable sans even in text. It is narrow but very open because of the angular counters. You might compare Vesta, the new face of Gerard Unger at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.gerardunger.com">www.gerardunger.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is one of the most readable sans I have seen, and your face promises to accomplish the same thing in a different way. He has rounded counters, and a narrow, humanist structure. He gets the openness partly by very narrow joins between round and straight strokes - a general feature of his designs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are approaching this in a different way, which gives a wonderful liveliness as well as good 'color'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like your new 7 and y. I don't know whether the f is an improvement; I would like to see more text setting.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The g I think still doesn't work; it looks odd and sticks out, to my eyes. Is the problem that the link between the loop and the top of the g sticks out too far to the left? That the link should narrow more in the joining to the top? Or maybe that the bottom of the loop should be lightened, following the stress in serif fonts? Unger does all of these in Vesta. You have a very different look, but maybe there is a way to make the g more harmonious adapting these patterns to your deisgn.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, it's been a while since I've posted anything about this face. Because it's been a while since I've done anything to it.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, here are my thoughts on spacing sans serifs. They come only from experience of looking, not designing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spacing between letters, according to Walter Tracy and others should relate to the space in the counters of the letters, as well as varying with external letter shape. I think the thickness of the stems is also a factor.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The challenge with san serifs is that absent serifs the spacing looks wide, tending to break up the words. So sans often more closely spaced than serif faces. But this close spacing can hurt readability, IMHO. Here Helvetical/Arial is a prime offender. When you have very circular letters, as opposed to narrower ovals then balancing the spacing with the counters can get ridiculously wide. But putting them very close hurts readibility, as the shapes of the letters become lost in the crush. If you look at a text setting of Meta, which is narrower and has more space in relation to the counters, it is much more readable than Helvetica.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I tend to think that Hrant is just mistaken about the greater importance of the external outline of the word, the 'Bouma' as he calls it, compared to the discernment of the shapes of the individual letters. I think that both are important. Thus wider spacing, to a point, helps, not hurts readibility. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another factor here is x-height. Another reason Futura is more readable than Helvetica, in spite of its circular letters, is that the smaller x height allows the space between letters to be looser and hence both more balanced and legible in relation to the spaces in the counters. And, yes, taller extenders also help on differentiating more the external outline of the words. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With all these ruminations in mind, my reaction your spacing is that in the more black text setting the spacing is OK, but it is too loose in the case of the lightest weight.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the letter forms. If I am not mistaken (I don't have the font) I believe that is what Gerard Unger does with his Vesta. That way when you narrow the spacing - which the narrow stems also seem to call for - you still have balance between the inter-letter space and the internal counters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I said earlier in this thread, I am really struck by how readable Vesta is as a sans. Unger has written a book about is views, and I am looking forward to the English edition, which I believe his site says he is working on.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Randy said, and as I noted earlier when you posted a smaller text setting, it is striking how readable Ardbeg is in smaller text settings. I think you have going for you not only the narrower shapes and the open counters that the angularity gives you (a la Dwiggens), but also a more generous x-height than Vesta.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of this promises to have you end up with an exceptionally readable sans, which I think is great. I think playing with the letter widths as well as spacing with the different weights, as Vesta seems to do, may help you get to this goal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the differences in the weights, Unger likes the relatively small differences between different weights, I guess based on the idea that what pairing of weights a designer would want would depend on the design and the paper.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for all the feedback. I'm implementing the suggestions, and I should have a new sample in the next day or so. The contrast is being dropped substantially out of the heavy master, and I'll re-interpolate the other heavy weights based on that. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;James Montalbano also gave a very interesting rationale  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had forgotten about that post. Thanks for the reminder, William. Based on that, I'm wondering if there should be 3 steps between the regular (fourth row in the PDF above) and the heaviest weight. As opposed to 2. That would allow a Medium weight to function per James analysis. As the weights stand, I can't see them working as a regular + bold and medium + bold. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;according to Walter Tracy and others  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I actually just picked up a copy of L.O.C. when I was at the Newberry Library last week.

That's this weekend's labor. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as the spacing goes right now, I've set the spacing for the regular weight - obviously it is in want of some tweaking. The lighter weights are optical spaced (a la InDesign) and tracked tighter - though not tightly enough. I haven't even begun to touch them for real. And the heavy weights have just some rudimentary side bearings set. Clumsy and horribly un-craftsman-like I know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That said, I shall attempt to tweak the letterfit of all the weights this weekend, concentrating on tightening the fit of the light weights. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;it allows you to make great quasi-fake smallcaps.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps I'll use this as my next test for weight distribution&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;In the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the letter forms.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I may yet give this a try.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Futura has wider spacing than Helvetica because it's designed better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ok, I can buy that Futura is better designed.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, I think there is more going on here. When I track Helvetica progressively wider, and the same with Futura, the words of Helvetica seem to fall apart and the whole look too loose long before Futura falls apart.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the longer extenders hold together the 'Boumas' (ack! did I say that?) better, so the smaller x-height sans can take looser spacing. In other words, I think the Helvetical designer did the spacing he did for a good reason, even though it messes up the readability at small sizes.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;a larger looking face compared to others of the same point size, requiring more spacing at the same optical size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, Tracy says that the spacing should match the counters, which don't change with varying the extenders. But he didn't discuss sans serifs. If you look at digital Gill sans, and type iio, the space between the ii is much smaller than the counter of the o, whereas in say Times it is very similar. Now I think I read that Gill in metal was spaced much wider, but again I think the digital adjustments were in response to a problem that the spacing looked too loose in the metal.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ok, the following is just a pet theory of mine, but there may be something in it. My theory is that without serifs you not only have problems visually finding the line of text, but also the spacing problems become substantial. Space a sans like a serif, and the words fall apart. Space it closely, and the legibility and hence readibility decreases in small (text) sizes. Hence sans are usually harder to read in text sizes. Large, the tight spacing is not a problem, as the absolute space between letters is big enough that legibility is not hurt.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the x-height and weight of the stem also affect how spacing works, especially with a sans. Also with narrower designs, the problems aren't so severe. I don't know what Unger has figured out about all this, but from the PDF of his Vesta, which mixes sans and serifs impressively, he has some new insights.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So even two Hrants (shudder <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) don't convince me.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Monarchy fovea bouma notan <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Democracy, iris, letter, notan (ok, I like notan). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The relevance to Nathan's spacing challenges in different weights is this the following. I don't have a clear theory of how to space a sans. But my point is that there is more in spacing a sans than is usually realized, and that therefore it is worth experimenting with both letter width and spacing, rather than just one or the other, if you have a goal of readability in text for your sans. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Note that your vertical proportions should ideally be multiples of 11! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; 1/28 <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That seems a bit low - the slant might disappear at lower resolutions. You might try 1/16. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not really. In fact a decimal base is easier to work with during editing; like 1/10 and 1/20 might be better here. I'm just a binary boy, that's all. On the other hand, powers of 2 are: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) easier to halve. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) in tune with TrueType's &quot;ideal&quot; Em values; like an Em of 1024 or 2048 will actually render [marginally] faster in the TT engine.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Nathan. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is shaping up to be a useful addition. Surprised at how small it sets. Lots of internal leading going on. 11 looks like 9. Looks good, but I might scale everything up 10%. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some general comments: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the lc italic is working fine. The upper has issues as you mention. It is much too dark. I tend to like caps that match the lc color very closely. To that end even your Roman caps look dark to me. Also, I'd add a touch more slant to the Italic caps (could just be the dark color that's over-emphasizing it) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Specifics: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->W: Not digging the crossing. It makes a huge black spot. Maybe in a titling version, or the light, but here it's too much IMHO. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->v,w: Watch for optical illusions in the stress. Looks left heavy. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->w: Looks dark. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Q: Thin the tail join <!-- raw HTML omitted -->F: Drop the crossbar a hair lower than the E <!-- raw HTML omitted -->S,s: Not digging the curves. The spine looks like he broke his back in 2 places. A bit less abrupt, but keeping the corner? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->d: Consider reversing the cut angle on the stem for uniformity. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->!: Looks dark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys. I kinda submitted this on a whim, Hrant. I'm working on a few more projects (a serif text face, another Thai bitmap, a Renner revival for a friend, etc.) but at this point I hate them all.
