  if anyone could ID the font used on the cover and as titles in the book accompanying
  the V&A exhibition \"Power of Making: The Importance of Being Skilled\". Doesn't
  even say inside what it's set in so little hope of naming the title font. I think
  it might be custom & there was an initial edition with a different set of fonts,
  I want the one with the green bits. \r\n\r\nLink: http://www.vandashop.com/product.php?xProd=8948&xSec=282\r\nISBN:
