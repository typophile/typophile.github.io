  body: "The 'O' gets lost for me (I read it as \"MMGamer\" until I realized \"MMO\"
    made more sense.) Make sure you design in one colour black and white before adding
    any colour or gradients to make sure it will read properly. Also, I'd suggest
    sketching on paper first (which it doesn't look like you did).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

- body: It reads "MMG AMER" to me. The AMER makes me think it's short for America,
    and MMG is a common abbreviation for "MultiMedia/Graphic Design" or "Microbiology
    and Molecular Genetics" at colleges. So instead of MMO Gamer, I read "Microbiology
    and Molecular Genetics America. That's not what you want, obviously. I agree with
    Lex - start on paper.

  body: "Drop \"The\" it's an unnecessary add-on, not to mention it may confuse people
    thinking that it's part of the URL.\r\n\r\nI'm also in agreement that the \"O\"
    is lost. You're being overly clever for no reason. "

  body: "Im case you're sticking to your design, try treating the \"O\" as a ring
    and hook the \"G\" to it.\r\n\r\nBut I would love to see you design some other
    alternatives."
