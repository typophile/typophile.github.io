body: "I've been eager to join this forum. This has been a really helpful source of
  information for the last years. \r\n\r\nI am trying to find a book about type design
  focusing on the process of designing a font. That is, since the catalyst or the
  idea, to the first primitive sketches, through the processes of adjusting and choosing
  the best forms for specific letters, designing alternates, etc. I am more interested
  in understanding how type designers \"think\" than the results they achieve.\r\n\r\nCan
  any one point me in some direction?\r\nAfter a quick search, I couldn't find any
  reference to such a book in Typophile. If this is a repost, I apologise.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

    a great source.\r\n\r\nShould I repeat this thread in the appropriate forum, or
    could a moderator please move is there?"
