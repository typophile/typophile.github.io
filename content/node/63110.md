  graphic for the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/smeltery/soupirs/|Soupirs ornaments
  on MyFonts]].\r\n\r\nAs this might very well be custom, I am also interested in
  anything with a similar feel (stencil or not).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stencil_6004.png]"

  body: It's <a href="http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/geronto-bis">Geronto Bis</a> by
    Jack Usine at Smeltry with a couple of custom additions. I'd hope they wouldn't
    use someone elses font to promote these. ;)

  body: "As the \xBBSoupirs\xAB-part in <a href=\"http://www.smeltery.net/dl/soupirs/soupirs.pdf\">this
    PDF</a> is embedded not as a font than as a pict, I would say it is custom designed.
    \r\n\r\nEDIT: Okay scratch that, Jeff got it right. It is embedded as a pict because
    of the ornaments. Good work. "

  body: I didn't look but I'd almost bet they used one of the floral ornaments from
    the font in the wordmark.
