body: Im working on a brochure for a Body Building/Fitness program. I&#39;m considering
  PENUMBRA &#40;the multiple master&#41; for titles. <BR> <BR>Looking for suggestions
  on a pair for text. <BR>Leaning twards a san serif face, but open to a serif as
  well. <BR> <BR>Ideas? <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>

  body: 'I&#39;ve always liked Penumbra, although it&#39;s probably the font that&#39;s
    suffered most from Adobe&#39;s dumping of MM, since its whole point was to smoothly
    vary the serif design. Good thing you have the pre-castrated version. <BR> <BR>For
    a matching text font, it would help to know how much serifness you&#39;ll be using
    Penumbra with. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, as much as I don&#39;t enjoy recommending
    Berthold fonts these days, you should look at their new &#40;actually pretty old&#41;
    Nero as an alternative to Penumbra: <BR><a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/home.html"

    Mantinia - Nero has some cool ligs too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I should have mentioned that this is a rather pro-bono type thing, so I&#39;m
    stuck with the type I have access to &#40;for free that is&#41;. I do have the
    font folios 8&amp;9 &#40;8 being where I had the MM faces&#41;. <BR> <BR>Ideas
    still? <BR> <BR>I was considering about a 600 setting for serif. <BR>Which is
    a little more than half way. I guess a little more the direction of serif, than
    wedge. <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>

  body: OK I might be changing my mind  -- MVB Celestia Antiqua Std?? Maybe? Never
    have used this yet. I liked the idea of the distressed/oldstyle that Nero had,
    and It made me think that I already had this. <BR> <BR>Ideas? <BR>

  body: 'I&#39;m envisioning something a bit wide and squat, and somewhat rigid, without
    much detailing, and maybe a certain Grot feel. Or maybe just some of those things...
    <BR> <BR>What about a wide cut of Kepler? <BR>Or a Clarendon. Or Egyptian 505.
    <BR>Do you have Warnock? <BR> <BR>Or if you want something really close to Penumbra,
    check out good ol&#39; Albertus. <BR> <BR>Wait, I got it! Kinesis. Although it&#39;s
    not squat. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m having second thoughts about the &#34;weathered&#34;
    look: it seems anti-fitness. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Something with veins.  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Actually, if there&#39;s a &#34;patriotic&#34;
    spin to this I&#39;d look harder at Clarendons, or maybe trusty Franklin Gothic
    &#40;assuming there isn&#39;t <i>too</i> much text&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    and of course clarendon, but no egyptian. <BR> <BR>Ohh and yes I have franklin
    &#40;maybe not Carters new fancy version ;&#41;&#41;

  body: Kyle, <BR> <BR>I assume you have <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/STUQ/F_STUQ-10005000.jhtml">Studz</a>
    from the folio? :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously, perhaps <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1702.jhtml">Calcite
    Pro Black</a> if you&#39;ve got it. It looks like it has the right balance of
    heft without being ITC Machine :-&#41; <BR> <BR>You might also consider a slab
    serif for your text. Lubalin Graph? Serifa? Or even possibly headlines. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: I think I have decided on Warnock. I enjoy the &#34;sleekness&#34; of it,
    while still having a touch of masuline flare.
