  can I get peoples thoughts on the kerning? The 'G' is causing me particular consternation...\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "There's an alternate 'G' in Bello Script (at Unicode 0122, gcommaaccent)
    that would fit better.  The short leading stroke on the subsequent 'r' is awkward
    to deal with, but can be moved closer to the alternate G. I tried connecting the
    G to the r, unaesthetically!\r\n\r\nThe gcommaaccent alternate would have to be
    modfied to remove the accent; for some reason that's the ONLY glyph with that
    alternate 'G'\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "I would amputate the \u201Centry\u201D stroke of /r.\r\nBut can\u2019t you
    modify this wordmark in some conceptual manner to make it really special?"

  body: Nick above said exactly what I would chip in to this. You usually need to
    sort out the lowercase 'r' for script typefaces, plus any other connections that
    don't actually connect. But really you want to also alter something to make it
    more unique and 'say' more about the brand.

  body: "Thanks all. Had an issue with the relationship between the d and h, which
    we've resolved by creating a ligature. Also made the G bigger which allowed us
    to move the r in closer and make it more like a vapour which adds the character
    - it is for a coffee shop after all.\r\n\r\nStill a work in progress but hopefully
    this is moving in the right direction. What do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grindhouse_logo_new2_4785.jpg]"

  body: "That \"dh\" conjoined twin action is pretty bad.  :-/\r\nIt might work to
    make them \"hug\" the way \"Gr\" is hugging.\r\n\r\nI would also try unjoining
    the bottom of the \"G\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again. The bottom of the G opened up looked a bit odd to my eye. However
    agree the conjoining was awkward - perhaps the rhythm of the other joins was throwing
    it out? Anyway do you think this is an improvement?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grindhouse_logo_final_5544.jpg]"

  body: "Strictly speaking, if you\u2019re being true to the inherent calligraphic
    ductus of this style, the d should join the h at the top, e.g:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cadburys_logo_6205.gif]\r\nHowever,
    I don\u2019t mind the gap you had originally, which echoes the space between G
    and r, and also follows the syllabic word break."
