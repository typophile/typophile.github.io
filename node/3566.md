  body: It looks like handlettered calligraphy. The only duplicated letter is the
    &#34;I&#34;, but the top serifs don&#39;t appear identical. I know that&#39;s
    not much to go on, but that&#39;s my guess.

  body: There is a Photo-Lettering type called Edridge Bookhand that looks a lot like
    this. It&#39;s in the 1960 Photo-Lettering Alphabet Thesaurus &#40;Vol 1&#41;.
    The problem is that the sample is too brief to see many letters. It seems that
    the possibility of film type being used must be a possibility too.  <BR> <BR>You
    asked if anything we know is close to it, and I would say <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/"
    target="_blank">Lydian/Lisbon</a>, but that has no serifs. I guess you could add
    some if the need was sufficient.
