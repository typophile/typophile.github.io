  body: "Why on earth you don\u2019t spend more time with these fonts before you release
    them is beyond my understanding. Some of the stuff you\u2019ve drawn is amazing!
    You clearly have talent, but it seems like you\u2019re focusing on quantity rather
    than quality."

  body: "Frank may have a point here. Look on \u203ATelltale\u2039. The weight distribution
    in a and e particularily seems rather unbalanced. The a is too fat between t and
    l. The swashy upwards terminators of w and y I find disturbing.\r\nWell, apart
    from such issues, it looks quite likeable. "

  body: "Frode-\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I've disappointed you. And you are right; some of
    my stuff I really should not be put for sale. Like Telltale.\r\n\r\nTelltale was
    a study of a low contrast serif type. And also an ongoing study of italics (So
    Andreas, your comments are valid as well).\r\n\r\nI quess the reason is that I'm
    currently working on four font families of my own design, and also on a smaller
    family that was commissioned, and waiting for the nex commission that should be
    coming in shortly.\r\n\r\nI've tried to do other things in between, but they tend
    to drive me away from any current work. Sort of like runner trying swimming for
    relaxing. That does not work for me.\r\n\r\nThat's why I go back to my old stuff,
    or make new stuff; to keep myself entertained. You know that after design there
    comes a huge amount of repetitious work: weits and italics and kerning pairs.
    I'm happy to do that stuff for a day or two, but after that I need more. That's
    why I keep bringing these smaller works about.\r\n\r\nBut you are right; I should
    not put these fonts for sale, just because I'm done with them as an interim study.\r\n\r\nFrode;
    I'll keep these to myself now on."
