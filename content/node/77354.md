  body: If you are planning to use water cooling in a computer, indeed you should
    use distilled water, because impurities in the water would cause the tubing to
    eventually clog - and, before that happens, the build-up of scale, for example,
    would reduce thermal conductivity.

  body: I'm afraid a water-cooled PC is a red herring. You need to look into [[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/potassium/potassium.htm|potassium
    cooling]]. The chemical symbol for potassium is, of course, K, and therefore would
    be of much more benefit in conferring sacred properties on your PC than holy water.
    Even better, you should try [[http://www.goucher.edu/x39600.xml|diode laser potassium
    cooling]], because this would get you much closer to absolute zero, which is of
    course holier. Then too, there is [[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/294/5545/1320.abstract|Bose-Einstein
    condensation]]of potassium atoms (K) by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_cooling|sympathetic
    cooling]]. Not only is one Bose-Einstein condensate, the Higgs boson, called the
    "[[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2850/what-is-the-god-particle|God
    particle]]," but sympathetic cooling is clearly better than the forced cooling
    practiced by unfriendly computer technologists. (And of course we all know who

    that having it in close proximity to the CPU of a computer employed in the task
    of designing a font for the Latin alphabet that has more positive spiritual characteristics
    is something you may view as fitting or beneficial.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted,
    though, that in general the expense of fitting a computer for water cooling is
    considerable; it is a minority of dedicated players of computer games who seek
    to overclock their CPUs far enough so that they require such an extreme measure
    to achieve adequate cooling in order to continue functioning.\r\n\r\nI note that
    at least one participant in these forums, Hrant Papazian, was sympathetic enough
    to your goals to participate in a font design for you. In general, as I'm sure
    you have noticed, there is considerable skepticism concerning the merits of your
    project.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly possible that some type designer here is also a
    fanatic gamer, with an overclocked rig, but I do think that the odds are slim."

    may also be noted that there is nothing wrong with the phoneme /k/. The original

    what people use to write.\r\n\r\nNow, I will admit that Kali isn't a very nice

    the convoluted letter substitution plan, it seems far too absurd to ask about
    a holy water cooled computer. Probably, if javascript really wanted the holy water
    to somehow affect the holiness of the exported fonts, why would it be required
    as a coolant. Although, I don't know for sure, I doubt that any religion requires
    or even recommends using holy water as a coolant for machines. Why wouldn't someone
    simply place a bottle of holy water inside the computer case? I think the first
    post in this thread was designed for comedy effect and nothing more. Because as
    absurd as his previous threads were, the very idea using holy water as a electronic
    device coolant is just too conveniently bizarre. While religion in general is
    chock full of cuckoo cuckoo, this request is akin to asking if anyone has made
    fonts using a computer that dispenses Eucharist wafers. Would you even doubt that
    such a thread is a troll?\r\n\r\nYes, I followed his previous thread and I thought
    there was a 30% chance he was the real deal. I believe there's a 90% chance this
    guy is yanking our collective wire.\r\n\r\nOn the 10% chance that javascript is
    actually serious about this: even if it turns out that converting to steam renders
    the water useless, perhaps almost boiling & reverse osmosis filtering could make
    the water clean enough to run through a filter."
