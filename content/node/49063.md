body: "Before I start asking questions, I do plan on purchasing a book to learn the
  ins and outs of typesetting. But in the meantime any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhen
  using small caps for abbreviations I've heard you you only apply small caps to abbr.
  with three or more letters. Is this correct? also do you apply small caps to numbers
  within the text i.e. 60%, 2008-2009, 2008 VA etc...\r\n\r\nAs a general rule how
  far do you indent bullet points? Does the rule apply for each level?\r\n\r\nHow
  much space do you leave between bullet points? Assuming you have type at 10/14 would
  each bullet point have a full line between them or about half. (Right now I have
  half a line of space between bullets on the first level and no space on the second.)\r\n\r\nI've
  seen where people small cap the first few words at the beginning of a chapter, or
  section; is this pretty standard practice?\r\n\r\nIs there a way to set up an action
  like in photoshop to change selected text from capital letters to lowercase and
  then to small caps?\r\n\r\nAny other links or wisdom you can send my way is also
  welcome. I know these questions are pretty type 101 but I've always worked online
  and have started to move into some print work and would like to do it right.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n

  body: "In general, I'd say the answer to all your styling questions is no. Buried
    in that is the notion that there are no rules. With book composition, some of
    these items would be covered by a publisher's house style, some by the designer.
    Still, in many ways design and composition are a continuum; it is hard to say
    *exactly* where one leaves off and the next begins. \r\n\r\nBut I'm a book typesetter,
    and you may be speaking of another form of \"print work.\" With \"print work,\"
    much is a matter of convention, not rules. In my area (book work), the old convention
    is to present material to a reader in a form that is both familiar and comfortable
    -- sometimes known as The Crystal Goblet -- except for very rare exceptions, such
    as with <cite>The Telephone Book.</cite>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Telephone-Book-Technology-Schizophrenia-Electric/dp/0803289383\r\n\r\nAs
    to changing the case (caps/lower case) and small caps automatically, that would
    depend on the layout program. If you are using Adobe's InDesign (paralleling Adobe
    Photoshop), the answer is yes."

    under actions with no luck. What are \"actions\" called in indesign?\r\n\r\nI
    understand that there are really no rules involved, but I guess I was hoping to
    get some people opinions on what they see as correct. Right now I'm at the beginning
    or learning all this and would like to hear from those who have been doing this
    for awhile.  "

  body: "It seems to me that you are interested in the nuances of traditional typography.\r\nIn
    that case, your best bet is to work in a page layout application, namely Quark
    XPress or InDesign, with OpenType fonts that have typographic features (small
    caps, alternate figure styles, etc). Then you will be able to access the actions
    you describe in the OpenType palette of these applications. Illustrator and Photoshop
    don't have quite so much typographic scope.\r\n\r\nAs a type manual, Bringhurst's
    <em>Elements</em> is the \"bible\".\r\n\r\nYour question about small cap figures
    (numbers) is an interesting one, that depends on context.\r\nIf you are mixing
    upper and lower case text with small caps, then old-style figures are probably
    best.\r\nThat's why it makes sense to check the fonts you intend to use beforehand,
    to see whether they have oldstyle figures.\r\n "

  body: "That is exactly the information I was trying to give you.\r\n\r\nTake bulleted
    lists for example. Whether or not to indent the bullet depends on the other list
    structures.  In general, you can indent the list proper the same amount you would
    indent an extract, and hang the bullets back. Or you can indent the bullets to
    the same point as an extract, with a further indent to the list proper.\r\n\r\nAs
    to spacing between items in the list: If the items in the list are short, no extra
    space is needed between them. The bullet will identify a new item. If the items
    are long (i.e., long paragraphs), then extra space between each item may help.
    space above & below the list is another matter; just as with extracts.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    if the list items are short (short paragraphs), I would probably set them ragged
    right. If they were long, and most of the other material were justified, I'd set
    them justified.\r\n\r\nI would never use a full line space extra -- unless you'd
    used that above & below an extract, and with 14-points of lead, I wouldn't do
    that.\r\n\r\nLarge bullets are usually considered in poor taste in bookwork, though
    I suppose they are the cat's pajamas in ad work. The old standby was a 2-point
    bullet, which would be close to a \"periodcentered.\" Another way is to not use
    a bullet at all, but an en-dash. Less obtrusive. What is considered important
    is the list proper, not the signaling device. A large bullet is too \"important\"
    visually.\r\n\r\nIf all this is beginning to sound like \"it depends on the content
    and the rest of the book,\" Then I've made the point I was trying to make.\r\n\r\nJut
    out of curiosity, why would you use full caps for two letters, but small caps
    for three. If you say \"The US and the USSR,\" would you full-cap the US and small
    cap the UUSR? I sure wouldn't. People might suspect a political meaning, which
    would (likely) be inadvertent.\r\n\r\nEtcetera"

  body: "Thank you for the thorough explanations. \r\n\r\nCharles_e I suppose I understood
    that it all was dependent on the content, but being new to this world I was hoping
    for some common standards to fall back on.\r\n\r\nAs for the two letter small
    caps, it didn't make much sense to me either. It seems to me it would be all or
    nothing. It was just something I had read and wanted to confirm.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Again  \r\n\r\n"
