  body: I think there's no such thing. I can't imagine that stretching and compressing
    a humanist serif font into monospace widths could result in anything you'd call
    "nice"...

  body: Thanks Nick, found some nice faces, but nothing that hit me in the face. If
    I can't find a monospaced humanist/traditional serif font, I'd like to find one
    thats Y width (when set in caps) is relatively close to each other.

  body: I'm curious what this unique application is. I'm assuming it's not code, so
    why do you want it monospaced?
