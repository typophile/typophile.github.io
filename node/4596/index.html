  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Earlier this year, I picked up a book in New Orleans containing two Greek plays: <i>The Frogs</i> and <i>The Birds</i>. The former is set Fleischmann with a great all caps display type. The following is based on (not exactly) those letters. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35103.gif" alt="Frogs sample"> <BR> <BR>I am looking to create a titling font with the fine lines of Bodoni or Didot, but more Baroque in flavor. I suppose the actual types could be a display version of Fleischmann. I'll post the printed sample when I get a chance. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Addison, I'd have to check the Enschede specimen book I'm hoarding from the UCLA library (the stratospheric 1908 edition) if this is really based on something F'man did (it sort of feels like Rosart too, although much more refined). Please remind me on Monday. <BR> <BR>BTW, this is feeling more and more like Carter's Victoria&amp;Albert font, a revival of which is now used by the LA Times for the section heads. <BR> <BR>About the widths: an all-caps font can have more ample widths for &quot;lopsided&quot; letters (like the &quot;T&quot;), because it's supposed to be spaced out a lot anyway. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">About the width of capitals, I believe that for a titling face there is often more variation in width than in caps made with an eye to lower case. Personally, I think it is more elegant to have not uniformity in wide or narrow, but the variation, such as in Forum caps or Zapf's Michelangelo titling face.  <BR> <BR>I suspect that small caps may often work better for titling because they are designed and spaced for all caps setting, as opposed to regular caps, which are done with an eye to the harmony with the lower case.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, JFP, for your correction and clarification. I have been using Minion SC for subtitles in a project I am working on, and found it worked better than the caps, but that is not actually a title, and there probably the smoothness of the small caps setting helps. I will look at this and check where I am using caps vs small caps with a better awarenes of the difference. <BR> <BR>But I guess for Addison, who wants to work on an all-caps titling face the point holds: he would best be guided by looking at other titling faces, or compare those faces which have both regular and titling caps.</div>
