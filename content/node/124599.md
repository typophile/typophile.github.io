body: "Hello folks,\r\n\r\nI'm hoping you guys can help me here, I'm trying to find
  out what correct typesetting rules/conventions there are for Arabic. So for example,
  when you have a quote, do you place a comma before it and then speech marks, or
  is there no comma? For a quote within a quote would you use a single speech mark
  or two? If you were mentioning a book and page number would there be a comma before
  after the book's name and then the page number? And if your type the letter \u0635
  for page should there be a full stop after it and then the page number [i.e., \u0635.
  \u0667\u0668] or no full stop [\u0635 \u0667\u0668]? And should the book name and
  number be between brackets, etc? Is there a single space before a question or full
  stop, as is the case in many books?!\r\n\r\nJust any help on correct conventions
  in Arabic typesetting would be great.\r\n\r\nThank you."
