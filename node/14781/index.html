<ol>
<li>Extend your arm horizontally to its full length in front of you with your thumb pointed up to the sky. 2. with both eyes open and head still, site on an object in the nearby visual field, 2-4 meters is best, longer is more difficult, shorter less telling. 3. as you line up the thumb and object, focus  on the thumb, leaving the object in the background to defocus. 4. When this is done, you&rsquo;ll find by closing one eye at a time, that only one of your eyes is still sited on the target, and the other is not. 5.

My left eye has been lasered to about -1.75 and works quite well for things closer up, eg the speedometer.
My brain is supposed to work out which image to use. It mostly does (took some time to get used to it).
I sometimes wonder whether I oughta had the two done the other way round. But then I may not be a graphic designer for the rest of my life…</div>

<p>Bert, lemme get this straight: you got your eyes intentionally lasered differently to be able to focus at different distances?! What&rsquo;s with you man, eagle-envy? I mean, I did that once with the Hella lights on my 2002 (one pointing to the rearview mirror of the car in front and the other to the left side mirror - to blind slowpokes into submission), but your <strong>eyes</strong>?!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I discussed it with the guy who did the lasering and it&rsquo;s perfectly feasible. My intention was to postpone the need for reading glasses as long as possible (since I an working with stuff at arms length mostly, like books. monitors etc.).</p>
<p>He told me a &lsquo;funny&rsquo; anecdote about the capabilties of the brain to adjust: seems that when older people that have cataracts have their natural lenses removed and exchanged for artificial ones are sometimes unable to discern distances at all, upto a year. Their brains can&rsquo;t adjust as easyly anmore.
Since I don&rsquo;t consider myself old yet, I was not to worried about this. ; )</p>
<p>Adapting to the &lsquo;dual vision&rsquo; was quite easy and the sensation of being able to see sharply when going for a snacking spree in the middle of the night is still a thrill&hellip;

<p>That&rsquo;s certainly true here too - probably even more so. But the thresholds seem to be very different. So for example lasik is much cheaper here, but that&rsquo;s because: people are looking after every penny; and the whole thing has been streamlined. The end result is if you want something different, you <strong>can</strong> get it, but you have to find somebody &ldquo;special&rdquo; and the price goes through the roof. Like bathroom tiles: if you&rsquo;re a person with normal finances, your choices are limited to what I call the Draconian Color Trio: White, Black, Almond. &ldquo;White, black, or almond, sir?&rdquo;, &ldquo;White, black, or almond, sir?&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s all they know how to say, repeatedly, until you break down and choose one. And Almond is a joke. You want a window installed that&rsquo;s not a white-aluminun double-pane with FAKE divisions deal? Pay through the nose and wait a month. You want a deep tan fridge to replace the one in your old kitchen where everything is deep tan? Well, screw you, you eccentric but not-rich-enough freak. The whole thing is becoming an Infernal Average.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Every October in Central Park there is a Falconery show and one speaker was talking about the Bald Eagle reentry program (They use to be all over the Hudson River). For four years they released 4 birds, all with tracking devices on them to tell where they went. The park they released them from is at the north end of Manhattan, I don&rsquo;t remember the park. Well one Bald Eagle flew up to a branch and looked upriver and took off in a shot. One of the observers used his radio tracking to follow the eagle 12 miles up the Hudson where the eagle had seen another eagle and went to meet it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. But I believe it. Just as amazing as their acuity and color sensitivity (they can detect a rabit&rsquo;s eye color from 1.5 miles away) is the fact that the lens in their eyes can morph at multiple points (as opposed to just getting globally thinner/fatter), which allows them full focus across their entire visual field. If humans had that we could read probably 3-4 times faster (not to mention have fewer car accidents). Like Sagan said, radiation is good for you.</p>
