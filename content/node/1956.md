  body: Haven&#39;t got a clue, Jason. As the lc &#39;a&#39; and &#39;e&#39; are  <BR>flipped
    versions of the same peculiar shape, there&#39;s  <BR>a possibility this is tailor
    made or at least customized.

  body: Take a look at <a href="http://www.fontalicious.com/super/fonts.html" target="_blank">
    Swinkydad</a>.  You have to browse through a couple pages of fonts to find it
    at the site.  The lc e is wrong, but Yves may be right about flipping the &#39;a&#39;.
