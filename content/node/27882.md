    1995\r\n\r\nITC Vinyl was designed by J. Keith Moore, who was born in Germany
    but raised in Colorado. The typeface is a hybrid of Art Nouveau, street attitude,
    and 1950s design and was created with pen, ink, and French curves before being
    converted into figital fonts with Adobe Illustrator. ITC Vinyl is a family of
    four display faces in outline and solid designs with corresponding \"sawtooth\"
    variants for each.</cite>\r\n\r\nMust be the 1950s bit."
