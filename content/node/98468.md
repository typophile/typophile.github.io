  body: Looks like Eclat by the late Doyald Young. Nick Curtis did a revival under
    the name of Creampuff.

  body: I recognized Doyald Young's and, thinking of Eclat and knowing it's not available
    to download, I overstated it could have been, Creampuff, simply slightly stretched.
    But you're as usual damn right Jan. Thanks for correcting me and sorry for my
    mistake.

    only as Mac Type 1 and as webfont."

  body: "As an aside, I recently, serendipitously came across two well made Bayer
    (1998) WinTT fonts called Buccaneer and Buccaneer Swash. I thought they'd do nicely
    for a little project, so I headed to Fonts.com to do the right thing. What do
    I find?\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/buccaneer\"
    title=>This</a>. No means I can find of seeing the 3 fonts included and only WinPS
    and MacPS as the format options. Bob Anderton originally offered this font family
    via ITC, so I tried that website - only to get no more info and be promptly kicked
    back to fonts.com.\r\n\r\nI contacted fonts.com asking what's up with only T1
    fonts in (then) 2012? \"I have money ready to spend on your website if you can
    offer me modern day WinTT or Opentype fonts.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later, my contact
    respond thusly, \"I spoke to the font development team and there are unfortunately
    no plans to convert the data of Buccaneer to TrueType or OTF. I apologize for
    the inconvenience!\"\r\n\r\nWhat the hell?? How hard or time consuming would it
    be to do the conversions?\r\n\r\nI really hope they don't drag down their various
    acquisitions to their level of website functionality or customer service. Am I
    missing something? Is there some good excuse for offering (lots of, I've since
    found) T1 fonts with no plans to update?"
