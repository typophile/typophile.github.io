body: Dear Typophiles; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m producing a small booklet with text samples
  and it&#39;ll be printed in Swedish and English.  <BR>I have, however, no clue what
  kind of text to use in the english version. I don&#39;t want to use <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>,
  and <i>the quick brown fox...</i> is a bit too short. <BR>What would you choose,
  which are the standard sample texts in english? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Fredrik, I never use Lorem ipsum, it has too many characters that aren&#39;t
    used in common english language. What I use for my comps is a part of a chapter
    of Alice in Wonderland. Mad tea party. I would advise you to investigate snippets
    from stories that might be in the public domain.

  body: How about if you use the text of any of &#34;Dubya&#39;s&#34; speeches.  They
    CERTAINLY qualify as Dummy text :-&#41;

  body: I usually try to grab interesting passages of text from the <a href="http://gutenberg.net/catalog/">Project
    Gutenburg</a> archive, possible even something thematically relevant to the project
    I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s absolutely one of the best places to find public
    domain texts.

  body: I&#39;ve heard it said that Lorem ipsum is used because it tends to make text
    look good. The theory being that the letterforms evolved for letter frequencies
    characteristic of Latin. If so, it might have value for presentation.  <BR> <BR>Since
    your purpose is publication, however, I think you should look for a passage that
    suits your fancy in some classic public domain text, a chidren&#39;s book or a
    classic of travel writing, for example. Take it as an opportunity to put some
    of your own personality into the project.

  body: Tom, Latin text has way to many x&#39;s, u&#39;s and other non common characters,
    and not enough e&#39;s so the color isn&#39;t accurate for common english text.
    I love Grants suggestion, but Cris has a point.

    copy.

  body: <i> &#62;the color isn&#39;t accurate for common English text</i> <BR> <BR>I
    know -- that was my point, actually. The idea of using Lorem ipsum is that it
    might make the presentation look better than the reality. Or so I&#39;ve heard
    said.  <BR> <BR>But that&#39;s not an idea I like. Personally I use my own dummy
    nonsense text or else some literary text.
