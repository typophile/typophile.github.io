body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nThis is my typeface Epiphany.\r\nIt is a contemporary interpretation
  of Russian skoropis. Epiphany has its origin in calligraphic scripts of 15-17 centuries,
  but it has almost no contrast. I saved typical calligraphic movements and historical
  letterforms, but I removed original skoropis tool (goose quill). So, Epiphany is
  not a revival, but skoropis of our days. It has rich set of Cyrillic ligatures and
  alternates.\r\nNow I want to create Latin letters for Epiphany. What can you advice
  me? Are there any Latin calligraphic styles which are suitable for my typeface?\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/epiphany_poster_900_600_6684.gif]"

    calligraphic styles that are \"suitable\" for this face. \r\n\r\nI'd start by
    adapting letters like A, B, K, etc. that are the same in Cyrillic and Latin, and
    then finish the rest off in the same style.  \r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: "Thank you, Matt!\r\n\r\nEpiphany has a lot of historical forms, because it
    is based on 15-17 centuries writting. So, I would like to add a shade of archaism
    to Latin too. And I need original historical Latin forms. Do you know any Latin
    script like a Russian skoropis?\r\n\r\nSorry for my English."

    modern for you. But \u0421yrillic readers can feel the spirit of the Middle Ages
    in Epiphany. So I would like to find historical forms to Latin.\r\nWhat can you
    say about my first attempt in Epiphany Latin?\r\n\r\nOleg Macujev\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/epiphany_latin_3617.gif]"

    ligature ss, and contextual alternate end character a. Why do you need to find
    something else?  You are perfectly capable of creating it yourself. Carry on in
    that vein and it'll be a winner in Latin and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

    Miss Tiffany: Art Deco? It\u2019s funny. I didn\u2019t think about this style
    while working on Epiphany.\r\n\r\nto Mica: Exactly, Epiphany is closely connected
    with national culture and national crafts. So, pysanky will be good application
    for my typeface.\r\n\r\nOleg"

    I think it\u2019s because it seems to lack an uniform direction/structure."
