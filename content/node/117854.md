body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy boss has lost the screen for one of our T-shirts, and he needs
  me to remake it in Adobe Illustrator. I was not the original creator of the design,
  and I'm stumped as to what fonts are used. The bottom one \"University\" looks like
  a typical varsity font, but the top one is giving me trouble. I tried to clean up
  the image in Photoshop and use whatfontis.com, but my graphic-art skills are limited,
  and I had no luck. If anyone could identify this font for me, or suggest a close
  alternative, I'd be most grateful. Cheers!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bighittersmall_6430.jpg]"

    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-agency|Font Bureau]] version if you'd
    like to get different variations in weight and width.

  body: Ryuk, Agency is a much better match for UNIVERSITY, not so much for CORNELL.
