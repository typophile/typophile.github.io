body: "Hello everyone, I've just bumped into this great site today, and was carried
  away by lots of interesting stuff and cooments and subjects ppl discuss here. Plenty
  of creative, out-of-the-box fresh thinking and professional advice.\r\n\r\nMy friend
  is opening a cafe soon here in Archangelsk city, Russia,so I have ordered a few
  designers a cafe logo, but still not satisfied with what they show me...\r\n\r\nThe
  name if the cafe is \u041A\u041E\u0424\u0415\u0420\u0423\u041C which (COFFEEROOM
  in english)...I sense that the Cyrillic font is not very familiar to ppl here...but
  maybe someone's got an idea of what font can be used for the logo...or recomment
  some web site with good logos archive so i can look thru it to get some inspiration..:)\r\n\r\n\r\nthanx
  everyone in advance\r\n\r\nhi from Russia\r\n\r\nAnastasia"

    want to have? With a name like \"COFFEEROOM\", maybe a tightly kerned Helvetica
    Bold in black on white would work, but we really need more information.\r\n\r\n

  body: "thanks all for a feedback :)\r\n\r\nwell, I will try to describe it in a
    few words : it's planned to open a cafe chain, with three or four outlets in our
    town and if all is well, few other towns as well. The cafe will offer one of the
    best coffee in town, bakery and drinks. It won't anything exclusive or arty, just
    a good coffee, nice lounge music and patisserie. can describe it as a good standard.
    as for target audience..middle class, students ...business people...\r\n\r\nIt
    is not an up-market project, just a good local cafe chain, as i already mentioned
    above- no special exclusivity about it, but still good value.\r\n\r\nAs for image...the
    owner really havent got any ideas so far, but i think it shouldnt be just trivial
    cup of steaming coffee or some simple coffeebean, although one can look really
    good if implemented creatively, so ....id like it also not to be very abstract,
    arty or quirky thing...maybe it can be icon image (pictogram) thing...it has to
    be smth simple at not banal at the same time...i will show down below the logos
    of the cafes i personally like...so maybe can bring u some ideas....\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
    everyone in advance\r\n\r\nAnastasia"

  body: "doesn't sound (to me) as though you're putting your efforts into finding
    suitable designers for these projects.\r\n\r\nI'd love to work on an identity
    for a cafe (based on a decent brief from an owner who knows how they want people
    to perceive and respond to their cafe/bar, i.e, not necessarily\"I want it to
    look like this\" more \"I want it to feel like this\")\r\n\r\n... anyway ... sounds
    like these designers had a great opportunity and let you down.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br

    Russia, though not the best one up to me...:)\r\n\r\nwe're local cafe chain...not
    up-market, Victor :) you comment made me smile :) but still thank you very much
