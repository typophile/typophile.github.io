  where, let me know if so.\r\n\r\nI am looking for font recommendations for a particular
  style. Its for a web 2.0 logo, ok,  I know all the typical web 2.0 style fonts,
  but what I need is very particular, I may even have to create a custom font. Anyway,
  I need a bold curvy font that all its letters joined up, sorry for lack of terminology.
  The company is building a social networking style site, I would like the lettering
  to play on the idea of 'connecting people'. I am sure I have come across such a
  logo, any idea/recommendations would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks"
