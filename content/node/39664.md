  way that commercial artists/graphic designers are treated in American society. I
  read it years ago, but have completely forgotten the name of the piece. Anyone have
  any idea what it is or where I could find it?\r\nThanks!!"

  body: "I believe the piece you are looking for is \"A Technique for Dealing with
    Artists.\" It's a little bit tongue-in-cheek, in a Jonathan Swift sort of way.\r\n\r\nThe
    original article was published in 1941 by the Press of the Woolly Whale. It's
    since been republished in a number of places. One is the 1947 Typophile Chapbook
    XVII -- <cite>MSS. by WAD</cite>.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's also included in the
    more recent <cite>Looking Closer 3: Classic Writings on Graphic Design,</cite>
    from Allworth Press.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    archives of what looks to be a bookplate collector's club magazine "Eks-Libris"
    - They are all presented in English and Croation.  The one you're looking for
    is issue 12
