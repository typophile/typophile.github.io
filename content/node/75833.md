  was used. New Times Roman (unfortunately) get fairly close, but not quite there,
  terminal of the upper case J is different, as are the proportions of upper case
  O and E. I only have this very small JPG available for indetification. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PSLogo_6669.jpg]"

  body: "I think whatever this began as, it has been altered. I seem to see possible
    connections to Perpetua. The J is closer to a shortened Perpetua J than a truncated
    Times J, I think. Perpetua's letters, such as the R are also wider. It might be
    a 'Franken-font', with parts from different fonts, AND with some editing. \r\n\r\n-
