  the german illustrator A. Paul Weber.\r\nIs he known out of Germany? What do you
  think about his work?\r\nIs it art? \r\n\r\nIts more a private question and I hope
  I am not disturbing.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nAh... what I forgot: \r\nMy Avatar
  shows one of A. Paul Weber's illustrations.\r\nIts called \"Optimismus ist Feigheit\"
  - (\"Optimism is Cowardice\"). \r\nIts from 1934.\r\n\r\nHere's another one, called
  \"Das Geruecht\" (The Rumor)\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4620.jpg]"

    what is art I would simply ask if his work is collected and displayed by art institutions
    as they are in the business of defining the issue.\r\n\r\nAlso look at defined
    sub-genres like \"outsider\" art. There is a wonderful book that comes to mind
    published by the Museum of American Folk Art titled <cite> Self-taught Artists
    of the 20th Century</cite> (ISBN 0-8118-2098-X) you might look at. I was particularly
    taken with A. G. Rizzoli and his work. The line between fine art and works recognized
    but relegated to qualified sub groups is hardly worth the time spent thinking
    about it. If it sticks with you and gets you going it is good."

  body: "Well...\r\nI agree that it makes no sense to discuss if something is art
    or not. Its enough to be touched. \r\nWhat I am thinking about: Weber was a political
    illustrator and he fought against Nazism in Germany. But - and this is very important
    (for me) - he does it in 1934, one year after the Nazis overtook Germany. And
    not in 2008 virtually in the Internet like lots of people who claim their anti-facism
    opinion (this is much more easier).\r\n\r\nIf someone insists on to forbid to
    show these illustrations - does'nt he try to hurt the general freedom of art?
    Do you think its a frontier violation or a worse attac against whomever to use
    e.g. the Avatar I do?\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

  body: "Who has the power to forbid that an artists work be shown? A curator makes
    a decision to include this artist and not another. I mention Dix because he was
    political and active during both world wars. You find, though, that his paintings
    relate to the German Expressionist movement in style. This makes his work linked
    historically to a movement and its stylistic innovation. He is not collected because
    of his political message.\r\n\r\nPossibly Weber worked in a political style but
    did not participate as heavily in the innovation of the German Expressionists.
    I don't know his body of work, and I'm not a curator so it is hard to judge if
    he is overlooked.\r\n\r\nMaybe you are speaking about copyright issues when you
    discuss showing the art and the use of the avatar?"

    I'm not thinking about copyrights.\r\nI do not know enough foreigners in Germany
    I can ask.\r\nSo I thougt to get an idea here how people out of Germany think
    about the artist A. Paul Weber, his work and if it is \"political correct\" to

    Art) in Duesseldorf 1970 or so... 400 freaks, all stoned and/or on good Timothy
    Leary's acid. Kraftwerk and its lasesrshow. It was dramaticly good.\r\n\r\nNo,
    not as a primary one. I don't believe that artists like Weber, Grosz and others
    thought in this way. They were bravehearted enough to work in an active way against
    the majority which voted AH. And this is the same majority which does not have
    any civilcourage (JFK) today to stand up and to say the truth.\r\n\r\nThanks for
