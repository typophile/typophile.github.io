body: "Hello all, first post.\r\n\r\nI have been told this could have been a Bodoni
  font that has been manipulated for an ad. I don't remember why I have it, it's been
  around for many months...it may be a scan or screenshot. but I've noticed that the
  counter, or opening of the o's are wider than most Bodoni's and PT Didona. Also
  the  top of the lower case \"i\" has a curve to it that kind of cups the dot, s
  does the \"n\". And of course, then, are the fantastic \"g's\". Any help would be
  MOST appreciated.\r\n\r\nthx  micki \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gione_4768.jpg]"

  body: Yeah, it kinda looks like it except for that very specific loop. I prefer
    Peter's.
