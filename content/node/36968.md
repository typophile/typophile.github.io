    fonts I have ever laid eyes on.\r\nI love the monocase version. The 'it' and 'gi'
    ligatures are lovely too. I could have done without knowing about that one. Now
    I have to go through coveting recovery."

    the graphic on that page reflect the font? There are all kinds of odd serifs that
    I kind of like, but Imperial doesn't seem to have them."
