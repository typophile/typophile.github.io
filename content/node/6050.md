body: What do you think about including latin punctuation on an otherwise english
  buiseness card. You see my name in spanish has an accent over the &#40;a&#41; while
  in english it doesn&#39;t. I think leaving the punctuation will ad a bit of destinction
  but then again I want to be typographically true to the design. Suggestions?

  body: I love it - although it&#39;s often used annoyingly. <BR>But it can be a non-intrusive
    way to add some flavor. And a great way to piss off Anglo purists.  :-&#62; <BR>

  body: If you want your name recognized with the accent, and to have people such
    as clients spell it with the accent, then by all means use it. &#40;I agree with

  body: thanks for the advice. this really pushes my design foward. I&#39;ll show
    some pics of my designs soon. All I  can say is that it will be very simple and
    elegant. It will be purely typographic and it will be letterpressed on cream color
    cotton stock. <BR> <BR>IM
