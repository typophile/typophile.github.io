  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Finally, I got myself together and now I&#39;m posting one of my designs for critique. The story so far: The company &#34;Paldin Holiday&#34; wanted a logo design. They operate a significant number of hotels and resorts. The task was described like this - &#34;we want something that would appeal to rich European customers. We like to show that we have hotels &amp; resorts not only on the Bulgarian Black Sea, but also in the Rhodopes Mountains, various ski resorts &amp; hotels&#34;. PALDIN is an old Roman name for my city, Plovdiv - but wanted me to stay away of the Roman element. That was okay for me, so I did something rather expected: <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53262.gif" alt="Logo 01"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53263.gif" alt="Logo 2"> <BR> <BR>Then, after a month of silence, they appeared and said: &#34;you know what - funny, but the real estate business exploded enormously, so now we&#39;re not only build and rent hotels, but also sell appartments. We love what we see so far, but could you incorporate some &#34;real estate&#34; element in the current suggestions. And they look like a travel agency&#34;. I pollitely told them: what do you expect , with HOLIDAY in the company name? Okay I&#39;ll see what I can do <BR> <BR>As you all see, those designs wouldn&#39;t allow me to add some sort of building, house or similiar symbol. So I started all over again: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53264.gif" alt="Logo BIG"> <BR> <BR>or  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53265.gif" alt="Logo 4"> <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m wondering, would they understand the last one, the roof shape that&#39;s being formed by the 3 squares... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m open for suggestions &amp; comments. Thanks in advance&#60;/font&#62;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ivan, this is where you need a marketing man to help you explain that you can&#39;t stick 10lbs of s_ _ _ _ in a five pound bag. If someone is looking for hotel properties or resort properties they probably aren&#39;t looking for real estate as well. I think either two logos will do it or they need to change the name to something that sounds like a holding company like Paldin Inc. The word Holiday looses its meaning.</div>

The logotype clearly states, in writing &#39;hotels, resorts, real estate&#39; so I think the roof angle, while nice, isn&#39;t really necessary...it&#39;s just a nice &#39;aha!&#39; when you explain it to them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that you are using too many colors on your logotype&#40;4&#43;&#41; and I don&#39;t really like the typeface you are using. You should work on the illustrations. I hardly see the mountains and the house looks more like a doggy shack to me. <BR>  Of the variations you gave the one with the circles have most appeal. <BR>  You can also try to make the symbols a bit smaller. <BR>If I am to compare the disigns : the ones that you made a month ago and the recent designs, I would surely choose the recent ones. <BR> <BR>Salute, Ivan <BR>&#40;i uspeh ;&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everybody, for the feedback. My main concern about the second set of designs is that they may look a bit like and information signs, rather than a logo. I would love to design a wordmark only, and lose all the symbols. But hey - the company I&#39;m working for is not Kioken and we can&#39;t afford to &#34;fire clients&#34;, like they did with Sony.  <BR>Galin is right for the colour usage...I should see how all these symbols would look in a single or 2 colour scheme. <BR>  <BR>Now I&#39;m waiting for them to decide.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Ivan  <BR> <BR>i have experience from a similar project in which the client  <BR>needed to achive his corporate id in various fields  <BR>and i can say that a succesfull marketing strategy might be  <BR>that you can create a generic id which can be transformed  <BR>easily to &#34;brand-identities&#34;. What you need is a simple,  <BR>flexible and distinctive form that will allow you to maintain  <BR>the charaxter of the company applied in various mannrs. <BR> <BR>For examble you may use two blocks:  <BR></div>
