  Matisse</strong> was inspired by the exhibition <cite>Drawing With Scissors</cite>,
  which I visited at the <cite>Kunsthalle Schirn</cite> in my hometown of Frankfurt
  am Main in 2003 and the book <cite>Jazz</cite> published in 1947 by <cite>Henri
  Matisse</cite>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, before i visited that exhibition, I wasn\u2019t
  a fan of Matisse\u2019s work, neither his late nor the early work. That definitely
  changed after the exhibition. While his motifs have been overused on postcards and
  mouspads, in front of the originals you forget those tiny pictures. Some of the
  works were massive\u2014larger than 24ft. By cutting directly into the color Matisse
  created shapes with strong dynamics.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ciseaux-matisse-specimen-typophile_4591.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nYears
  later, in 2007, I used that inspiration to cut an exclusive font for a newspaper
  that I designed at that time (see pictures below). Later I developed that font into
  the four styles featured here. \r\nThe <strong>cut-out style</strong> is a paper
  cutout; <strong>boxed</strong> is the paper background. Both <strong>linear</strong>
  and <strong>boxed linear</strong> have no curved outlines, so they are more <strong>aggressive.</strong>
  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs drawing with scissors implies, all characters are <strong>cut by
  hand</strong>. With only uppercase letters, this font is designed for editorial
  use:\r\n<strong>headlines, slogans</strong> in ads, or musical usage in <strong>posters</strong>
  and <strong>flyers</strong> that need the little touch of the <strong>jazz scissors.</strong>\r\n\r\nIn
  special cases the lowercase letters contain alternate shapes to the uppercase forms.\r\n\r\nThe
  Font is available in a set with paper-scissors directly on my <strong> Website\r\n[[http://www.haraldgeisler.com]]</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Special
