  a deadline for a direct mail 4/4 uv. The whole piece is designed with placeholders
  for logo.\r\nOf course they send one from the web, too late to get ahold of sign
  company or whoever did the logo.\r\nHave to do the whole rebuild it over the top
  thing in Illustrator.\r\nGot the script from the top (cropped out) but I know this
  is a basic font for the yellow letters shown in my sample image.\r\nThanks everyone....\r\nVisuaTek\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/motorco_5231.jpg]"
