  as given [[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=16834&start=0|there]]:\r\n\r\n1
  - Go to wikipedia. Hit \"random\".\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random]]\r\nThe
  first random wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.\r\n\r\n2 - Go to
  Random quotations:\r\n[[http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3]]\r\nThe last
  four or five words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first
  album.\r\n\r\n3 - Go to flickr and click on \"explore the last seven days\"\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/]]\r\nThird
  picture, no matter what it is ((SFW of course)), will be your album cover.\r\n\r\n4
  - Use photoshop or similar to mix it all up. Host it and bring it here.\r\n\r\nI
  bet you all can come up with some spectacular ones. Here are a few that I've already
  done: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_4571.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New

  body: Blame it all. I even searched Typophile for "album cover" first. Well, this
    thread is still open, whereas the other isn't. Whatever you feel should become
    of this thread will be fine with me.
