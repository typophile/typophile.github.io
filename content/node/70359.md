  body: It's very similar to Knockout Junior Flyweight in but some of the characters
    such a 1 and J are totally different. Thanks though. Any other takers?

  body: Figured. I was surprised, since it seemed to ignore the limitations of printing
    boarding passes at kiosks. But since more and more people are printing boarding
    passes at home, I thought it was a possibility that Delta was starting to abandon
    thermal printing.
