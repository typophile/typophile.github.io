body: 'Hi All. <BR>I&#39;ve been working on and off with a collection of typefaces
  for my conceptual foundry Brainreactor/GyoDea. The collection starts to take shape,
  and I would be glad of any comments regarding my work.  <BR> <BR>The collection
  contains both display/experimental and some sans serifs for Display/Logo purposes.
  <BR> <BR>I appologize for the pdf layout in this preview, I work on a book where
  all the fonts will be displayed in a proper way. <BR> <BR>All typefaces have full
  alphabets with upper- and lowercase letters, numbers and so on. However,  I think
  it&#39;s a bit early to show them all in here. I have 24 other full alphabets going
  on on top of the ones I show here. I will upload a new pdf within two weeks, with
  more and harder experimental Typefaces. <BR> <BR>Any comments? <BR> <BR>Andreas

    I think each one needs its own topic for the sake <BR>of clarity.

  body: Andreas, I like the types, allthough they very much remind me of B&uuml;ro
    Destruct.  <BR>I see the point Stephen has with the readability and clarity, but
    that doesn&#39;t bother me that much. These types will probably only be used in
    flyers, poster, CD covers, etc. Therefor they are OK, if you ask me. They are
    more peaces of artwork than types.  <BR>Where BD made more readible type, in the
    shape of futuristic forms, you go more autonome. It&#39;s your personal decision
    and that&#39;s fine. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t stop bringing them out. You will find
    people that want to buy them. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren

  body: Ok, it seams like you guys want some more to discuss. <BR>I will upload some
    more when this discussion starts to discontinue... <BR> <BR>&#62;Jim, sending
    30 dollars with mail worked a couple of years ago, the thing is that the fonts
    where released with a book called &#34;Metalheart&#34;. Some people wanted the
    fonts only and asked me how to get them without buying the book. Back in 2000,
    I was making the site in that purpose. I still get some dollars from it. The site
    is almost 4 years old, and some of the fonts are 8 years old. Still going strong
    in some computers... Thanks for your comments! <BR> <BR>&#62;Ren

  body: Hey, I will continue with my experiments... Or call it self-expressive needs
    if you want. I think Hrant is right about the theory about readability versus
    experimentation, but if everyone was experimenting with readability I think the
    typographic scene should look very boring after a while...? <BR> <BR>Think about
    this; If I tell my wife that I Love her, I should probably use a quiet language
    typed with my mouth using some classic typography. If I want to scream to the
    world that I have something to sell, say or maybe proclaim... I think a language
    that gains interest visually is better...!? <BR> <BR>Andreas <BR> <BR>&#62;Ren

    it&#39;s a matter of balance, and giving society what it needs at a given moment
    - certainly a very dynamic thing. I just think readability doesn&#39;t get any

  body: 'Andreas, I&#39;m a huge admirer of your work. Let me say right now that I&#39;m
    no type guru. But I am a lover of words. In fact, my love of type comes directly
    from my love for words and the act of expression through writing. <BR> <BR>For
    this simple reason, I have no problems at all with the readability of individual
    characters, or even the readability of a word, so long as its aesthetic expression
    is dramatic and intelligent. It may take a moment of adjustment to pick up the
    letterforms, but it is the artfullness of the type that demands I invest my attention
    in the word it represents. <BR> <BR>What I mean to say is, there are more uses
    for type than just stringing together complete sentences or paragraphs. I do not
    see any need to compare your work to more mainstream samples or useage. <BR> <BR>There
    is a definate place for your type: right on the cutting edge. <BR> <BR>Wherever
    there are words written in the throws of anxiety, anger, excitement, suprise,
    nearly any condition of extremety, your letterforms shine appropriate.'

  body: Hrant, I agree with you completely. <BR> <BR>My point was that much of Andreas&#39;
    work is so obviously aimed at titling and not paragraph useage, there is no need
    to justify why we like his work with comments like &#34;these types will probably
    only be used in flyers, poster, CD covers, etc. Therefor they are OK&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>I do not want to lock horns with you on the deeper effects of typography upon
    the reader, as you have given this subject much more thought than I. <BR> <BR>However,
    I for one, am up for the challenge of a few new takes on familiar letterforms
    for the sake of emotional representation of the word itself.
