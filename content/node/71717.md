body: Hello, I am new to typophile and figured i would get my feet wet with a critique.  This
  is a logo I am working on for a mortgage company.  They are looking for an upgrade
  from their current identity and would like the new look to reflect power, and look
  new and clean.  The color pallet was chosen by the customer as well as the general
  look and imagery. He has a specific look in mind similar to that of "Nation's Plus".  I
  would appreciate and constructive criticism.  Thanks.

    on alternating planes, and it's chaotic. That said, it's quite valuable to work
    strictly in black and white and finalize the design before adding color. \r\n\r\nRight
    now, none of them stand out. They're all too crowded and unbalanced. Keep simplifying.
    An old professor once said \"you'll know you're done when there's nothing left
    to take away, and your message is still in tact.\""

    a need to simplify (my professor was cut from the same mould). Having said that
    there seems to be some promise in the right hand column designs.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "I'd definitely play with the first and third ones in the second column, the
    others are a bit simplistic and for some reason they seem horribly familiar to
    me somehow. I agree with the others  on the colours, the alternating colours on
    the text make the words jump, it's not very pleasing to the eye.\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    On a completely different note (is it the company with the current orange/green
    website with the bizarre font?) you might want to suggest to them that they make
    a definite choice between \"1st\" and \"First\" (I see you've used both) and stick
    with it, everywhere. It's their name, and as far as establishing that name and
    making it findable, it would be handy if they decided on one or the other.) "
