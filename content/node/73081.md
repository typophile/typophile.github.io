  body: "Society Page NF is a digitization of Announcement Roman. So is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/odette/?testdrive=src%3Dcustom%26text%3DThe%2520Holt%2520Family%26size%3D81%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3DFFFFFF%26w%3D720%26goodies%3Dfit%252Cot.liga%26dock%3Dfalse%26seed%3D25?refby=mfde\">Odette</a>.
    Latter has both the straight and the swashy \u2018T\u2019 bar, while Society Page
    NF has only the curly one."
