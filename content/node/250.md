body: Hello everyone. I happened upon this site a week ago, and I must say I enjoy
  looking at all the original logotypes and custom lettering. So much so that I felt
  like dusting off an old project. <BR> <BR>The loose name for the face is Shard.
  It is not done yet, and it needs Caps. I thought I&#39;d turn to the online type
  community for inspiration. <BR> <BR>Btw, I am without $549 at the moment to buy
  Fontlab, any other way I can turn this into a font from an EPS file? <BR> <BR>Thanks
  much, <BR>Andrew Baker <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11238.jpg"
