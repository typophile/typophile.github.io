body: Hello, hoping someone can help me out. I have created 4 fonts in a family, however
  the alignment of the baseline moves up and down when I select from different styles
  in Suitcase, or Mirosoft Word etc...  <BR> <BR>I have created them in FontLab, and
  ensured that that dimensions &#40;decent, acent, descender, ascender etc..&#41;
  across all four fonts are identical. No matter what I do they never turn out consistent
  though. I have opened other fonts in Suitcase and their baselines remain identical
  when selecting from various styles in a family. What am I doing wrong?... <BR> <BR>Any
  help is REALLY appreciated.
