A good way would be to have 3 tabs up the top to open up seperate sub pages which could be:</p>

<li>Solved posts.
This way people could look in a more focused and uncluttered way.

(b) be instantly deleted;

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, it&rsquo;s 01:45 am now, and I had to drive all the way back to work to print the remainder of the 192 page book I designed the past two weeks, as they need to be proof-read by my colleague first thing this morning. While the prints are rolling out of the machine, I&rsquo;ll tell you guys a little story.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I was a &lsquo;regular&rsquo; visitor of Typophile. Managed to pull off a couple of successful ID&rsquo;s, built up a little rep, got friendly with a number of people. In those days, the Stewfmeister literally owned this place.</p>
<p>At some point, the tagging, (x)-ing and renaming of successful identifications was introduced. It was a vast improvement for the reasons we all know, but Stephen once explained me how much work it was. He had to open <em>every single thread,</em> check if it was identified and by whom, double-check both sample and result to assess if the identification was correct, then go to the Admin side and tag and rename the thread. All went well until I noticed that &ndash; as traffic started to exponentially grow &ndash; Stephen appeared to have trouble keeping up. I <em>did</em> know he was a busy guy, being co-owner of Typographica and actively involved in a couple of other type websites, but it still came to a point where I started to get annoyed by the lateness of the tagging.</p>
<p>Did I start a thread on the forum to whine about it? Nope, I sent an offline e-mail to Stephen, offering to help him with the maintenance of the Type ID Board. And now it&rsquo;s me who&rsquo;s head honcho of this place.</p>
<p>I realise this might sound like I&rsquo;m ticked off, but don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not. That&rsquo;s why I first cleaned some of the backlog before replying. I just wanted to put some stuff into context.</p>
<p>The prints are all done, so I&rsquo;ll continue with some &lsquo;splainin&rsquo; of the current situation tomorrow. Then, after that, I&rsquo;ll peek into my crystal ball and tell you what might be in store for this area once Typophile finally gets out of Beta.</p>
<p>Bear with me, it&rsquo;ll be worth it.</p>

<p>It says on the Forums page that the Type Identification Board is sponsored by FontShop, and there occasionally is some advertising on the site, plus there are quite a few paying members.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be mistaken &ndash; I don&rsquo;t see <em>any</em> of this money, not one cent. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to neither, but the fact still remains that I invest real actual time into this place, and quite a substantial amount even, for free. I used to participate in General Discussions, and I used to pull off double the ID&rsquo;s I do now. Not anymore, as I don&rsquo;t have any time left besides my family, my work, my independent graphic design activity, my rock band, and my three (soon four) writing assignments.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m playing the victim here &ndash; I like doing this, because it allows me to give to the community, to provide a real and valuable service. I&rsquo;m not complaining, but maybe a reminder of the proper context was in order.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks David. :^)</p>
<p>While driving home I realised I forgot to answer Patricia&rsquo;s original question:</p>
<p>Whenever my daytime job starts spilling over into my downtime &ndash; which is never really &lsquo;down&rsquo;, but what&rsquo;s in a name &ndash; my voluntary work is the first thing to be sidetracked. I&rsquo;ve been racing against the clock to design this book, so that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the maintenance of the Board lately. Today I sacrificed my lunch break to clean at least the current page, and I&rsquo;ll see what more I can do this weekend.</p>
<p>As long as the new functionality of typophile isn&rsquo;t implemented, this will be a recurring situation. It has always been like that in the past, it will be like that in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I will take into consideration any and all applications for assistance and pass it on to J&rsquo;n&rsquo;J, but please keep in mind I&rsquo;m just the cleaning lady here &ndash; it&rsquo;s not up to me to decide whose profile can be upgraded and granted moderator access.</p>

<em>For all the work you had, and may have, with Typophile and the Type ID boards.
For all those helpful replies, for clearing things up.</p>
<p>( I actually dont quite understand / get this thread, but what ever. I dont know how some of you even find the time to be &lsquo;here&rsquo;, day and night. Even I try to get back on here, log in as often as I can, but &lsquo;The Real Life&rsquo; and what some may call &lsquo;Work&rsquo; is sometimes more than just &lsquo;catching&rsquo; up, with me. I love Typophile, I really like and respect its fellow members, its just that there sure still ARE other things happening beside and beyond it. )</em></p>
<p>Thanks, Yves.
Thanks, Typophile.</p>
<p>Dav</p>
<p><em>* I wouldnt want to be a Typophile moderator, as I not even had / have the time to be a regular user / member / reader / poster, in here, lately. ( And, Thats why I do respect those unpaid, freelance &lsquo;Moderators&rsquo; like Yves, who gave and give their heart blood for Typophile, for keeping, along with the participation of all the &lsquo;regular&rsquo; members of course, this place alive, and, clean. )</em></p>

However you manage to find the time I never could figure out.
And how you keep track of all those fonts is a bigger enigma :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to sound unappreciative of Yves&rsquo;s (or anybody&rsquo;s) hard work, I didn&rsquo;t understand how this worked exactly. I was just having trouble finding some threads and figuring out if they&rsquo;d been ID&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>So Yves, thank you for providing me with an excuse to take a break from work. Ironically I&rsquo;m on this site more often when I&rsquo;m swamped with work because I&rsquo;m spending more time in front of my computer. When I&rsquo;m not that busy I try to get out of the house and to my painting studio or a museum.</p>
