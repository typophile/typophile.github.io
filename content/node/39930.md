  hereby another program I worked on: [[http://www.fontconstructor.com|Font Constructor]].
  It's a free to download! \r\n\r\nThis project started as an tool to explain construction
  of an alphabet to students. Font Constructor is not only ment for students. The
  application can be used by graphic designers, typedesigners or be anybody who has
  fun with it.\r\n\r\nYou can: \r\nimport/export UFO's\r\nexport OTF's (be aware,
  very rough: no hinting, no kerning, no features)\r\ncopy paste from Illustrator
  or Fontlab\r\nit has a small vector editor inside. \r\n\r\nMore info about the application
  is available on the [[http://www.fontconstructor.com|Font Constructor]] website.\r\nThere
