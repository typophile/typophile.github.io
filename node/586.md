body: 'we are involved in the rebranding of romania&#39;s seventh IT company and we
  have analysed so far rebranding programmes for IT companies. almost all of them
  go for the logotype solution. <BR> <BR>so, we tried to develop a logotype based
  on the visual personality of the old logo, in an attempt to preserve some brand
  equity. I wanted to ask all the great type designers on this forums where they get
  theit inspiration from. <BR> <BR>how do you start working on a logotype? <BR> <BR><img

  <BR>is the solution we came up with acceptable from the type pont of view? thank
  you all so much .... <BR> <BR>PS: there is another thing bothering me now: brand&#39;s
  verbal distinctiveness lies in its &#34;X&#34;, but this letter evolved into a visual
  cliche. what&#39;s left to be done?'

  body: I don&#39;t like to be rude, but maybe you should really think again about
    the concept of that double line in x letter. It is not just that it is a visual
    cliche, that cliche is also a bit dated and could even cause difficulties with
    legal protection in many countries.  <BR> <BR>&#62; how do you start working on
    a logotype?  <BR> <BR>Mostly the same way you did. What you did could be one of
    the schetches, but maybe you have to look for more solutions and than choose the
    one with no obvious problems like &#39;visual cliche&#39;. <BR> <BR>In case you
    insist to present this logo, you will probably have to make vertical/horizontal
    optical correction. You should also consider the rythm of the logo which is broken
    &#40;as Dmitry noticed&#41; by the very wide and open D. It&#39;s counter is much
    larger than the ones in other letters.  <BR> <BR>I hope that we will be able to
    follow the evolution of this logo soon. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: George told us in his post that Radix is &#34;romania&#39;s seventh IT company.&#34;
    Therefore I would assume that they are involved in &#34;information technologies&#34;
    and process or manage some sort of information. <BR> <BR>Vague still, but probably
    not copiers.

  body: yes I read that part. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m talking like what kind of information
    and what kind of technology, what are the processing, managing - what&#39;s the
    difference between them and Nortel or Adobe or wotever. are they involve in HR
    tech, Telecom tech, bio tech, Security &amp; Encryption, do they have products?,
    is this database engineering, archival? surveys? what!! information tech dosen&#39;t
    mean anything anymore - there&#39;s a human side to every company...what makes
    them important to have, hire, know about. <BR> <BR>&#34;IT&#34; is about ambiguous
    as &#34;consultant&#34; or &#34;designer&#34; for that matter <BR> <BR>Xerox the
    copy copany,  is IT as far as my definition goes, they have a technology for information,
    they do understand themselves as IT however old school it is; but the common understanding
    is that they help you copy information.  <BR> <BR>IT could also be the dewy decial
    system.

  body: well, it seems I wasn&#39;t very specific with the details I have provided.
    Radix is involved in several field of IT. more can be found on <a href="http://www.radix.ro"
    target="_blank">www.radix.ro</a>, their corporate website. <BR> <BR>as I have
    already mentioned, they decided to rebrand due to several factors, among which
    the high similarity of their symbol to that of one competitor, and the anniversary
    of 10 years of activity. the celebration will be held on July the 19th and all
    the work has to be done by that moment. they decided for a logotype that incorporates
    some design element that would preserve a part of the visual equity of the brand,
    that&#39;s why the whole process is rather hard to develop. <BR> <BR>I will be
    providing refinements made to the logotype as I develop them. <BR> <BR>thank you
    for your imputs.

  body: <i>mm = millimeters versus points.</i> <BR>It is preference in units. The
    advantage I see in using points is a direct relationship between the layout measurment
    and the type measurement can be more precisely calculated. However, since so much
    of design is not about calculating, but seeing, I&#39;d say who cares. Trust your
    eyes.  <BR> <BR>The card looks nice. <BR>Good work George.
