  I'm searching for the following:\r\n\r\nWe all know Eurostile, and while it's a
  fine font, it's being abused to no limit. I seek those abuses ! I spent hours searching
  in various bookstores with a nice supplement of extremely old and bad SF/Fantasy
  [where Eurostile is much in demand] but couldn't find a single one ! oh yes, all
  other 60-80's favourites passed, DIN, Data 70, etc but no Eurostile !\r\n\r\nSo
  while I can go search on with no end in sight, I hope some of you might have seen
  things like this, the older, the worse, the better ! I'm sure there are even books
  typeset in it, which would be even better. I'm still searching myself, and seem
  to find more Eurostile in dance/trance music covers and bad suspense novels.\r\n\r\nExtra
  kudos for books translated in a different language ! [those tend to end up designed
  pretty poorly and have bad typesetting]\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nOranginas"
