  and New York. Is there a place where I can get these? (Preferably online, as I don't
  really want to dive into my huge collection of system and OS-discs to find it right
  now...) \r\n\r\nIn theory, I still have the license for them, as my old OS licenses
  are still valid; though I really wouldn't mind paying a little for them either...\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I'm reasonably sure Apple has their old Mac operating systems available at
    least up to System 7, if not later, available for free download at their company
    website [[http://apple.com]]. I can't think of the direct link off hand. Those
    old OS versions should include the basic fonts along with them. You'll have to
    dig through their download archives, though, and there may be other hoops to jump
    through.

  body: "From that list:\r\n\r\n[[http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/System/Older_System/System_7.5_Version_7.5.3/]]\r\n\r\nIt
    appears System 7.5.3 is the latest full version posted for free download, but
    with updaters you might be able to push that to 7.6.1. You'll have to skip up
    the parent directories to find everything. I'm not sure how up-to-date the fonts
    are at those versions. You should find the GX versions of the ones you're looking
    for, which is nice to have, though you might have to take them apart to find all
    the goodies hidden within."
