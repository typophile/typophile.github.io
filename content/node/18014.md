  body: Interesting news, Alessandro. Is this a design magazine, or more fine art-related?
    Does it have anything to do with typography or type design? Are you involved with
    it editorially

  body: Thank you, glad to hear that. 'Bak' is a visual arts magazine, which includes
    graphic design (and typography of course), illustration, photography, paintings
    and original print works. So people can submit their typographic works or visual
    arts related articles about the theme of the issue, too. There is lack of typography
    in Bak for now and we hope talented typographers will submit their works for the
    future issues. Yes, we started a collaboration.
