  body: There is a digital version of it, called <strong>Serius SSK (Bold)</strong>
    (or Serius SSI) but it's from the well known font forgery company Southern Software
    (Copyright 1993 Southern Software, Inc) so I suppose they steal the outlines from
    another digital font as usual.

  body: "Found another version with rounded top M - 1990-1993 FontBank, INC. called
    Rondalo Regular (possibly source of SSI)\r\n\r\nedit: further research shows FontBank
    did digitize its products from various printed type specimens.  The most likely
    source being a old Chartpak transfer lettering catalog which shows both M versions."
