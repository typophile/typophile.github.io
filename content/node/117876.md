  I'd like to send them a note, but don't know how to put it in words. The lines look
  irregular, both vertically and horizontally to me, but maybe it is just that the
  column is too narrow to do full justification at that size? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type1_4165.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type2_3442.png]\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "There's no specific defect in this sample. There are no hyphen strings. There's
    a river, but it's not egregious. There are a couple of loose lines, but overall
    the word spacing isn't excessive. It would look better with another point or two
    of leading, but journals don't usually have that luxury.\r\nThe text face itself
    may be what you're reacting to. It has a large x-height, shortish ascenders and
    descenders, and small, blunt serifs. It also has low contrast between thick and
    thin strokes. To my eye, these factors combine to make the letters all look the
    same, and thus impede reading. If I were designing this journal, I'd use a more
    traditional text font with more thick-thin contrast and slightly smaller x-height. "

  body: "IMO the spacing is wrong for a condensed, low contrast face. Increased sidebearings
    on the curved characters and diagonals would help\u2014or, same difference, reduce
    sidebearings on the verticals and track the whole thing out.\r\n\r\nNote in the
    enlargement how o_d creates a heavy area, and how y_o is tighter than o_u. And
    see how in l_u_d the space between characters is uneven, although the curved stroke
    of /d is close to vertical.\r\n\r\nIt would have been better to have adopted the
    spacing paradigm of a condensed sans, rather than use that of a typical serif
    face.\r\n\r\nThe italic is also off-center, to the right.\r\n\r\nThe hyphenation
    at right might bene\uFB01t from hanging, which can be done via InDesign\u2019s
    \u201COptical Margin Alignment\u201D (Type and Tables > Story)."

  body: 'Thanks for the great insights. I think the x-height must be the main culprit.
    The baseline looks like it is bouncing as well: in the enlargement, the u in the
    bold `source` looks elevated. The n_ot in `not` looks off too. Maybe I''ll just
    send them a link to this discussion and see if they will consider another typeface. '

  body: "The overall effect of the spacing is not good. The first thing I would try
    would be to take the type size down a half a point. This in effect increases the
    leading, but it's not quite the same thing. Example: I recently tried spacing
    (kerning plus side bearing work) a font, and with a 10-point setting, it just
    didn't work very well. I could get it better, but not joyful. But set at 9.5 point
    (and with several leadings), everything began to click. \r\n\r\nOur one-size-masters
    tend to work that way, esp. for continuous text setting. There will be a range
    of sizes, ceteris paribus, that work well. Things will quickly fall apart as you
    stray too far from these. You can save them to a degree by changing the word spacing,
    or leading, or measure (margin) but it's only to a degree. The internal space
    of letters, which is not modifiable in layout design or typesetting, has an affect
    too, along with word spacing, leading, and margins. All space interacts. \r\n\r\nYou
    have to learn to live with what a particular typeface offers and use it to its
    best advantage, not some theoretical ideal. That's part of what is called \"interior\"
    or \"text\" design, and it is by no means as easy as many think. It takes an eye.\r\n"

  body: "When you consider that this is probably a modification of an existing \u2013probably
    decent\u2013 font (look at the contrast in quality between the easier letterforms
    versus that horrid \"g\") I think what's happening is that Luin made the serifs
    much heavier but left the round overshoot the same, which means they became inadequate,
    causing apparent misalignment. The spacing being so uneven might even point to
    the original having been a sans, but I'd have to look closer.\r\n\r\nIf we want
    them to change the font, we'll have to suggest something similar in character
    but crafted much better. Maybe one of these sisters:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/meridien/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger-serif/\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    internal space of letters, which is not modifiable in layout design or typesetting</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHmmm,
    now I'm wondering whether InDesign's \"optical spacing\" can be useful here.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You
    have to learn to live with what a particular typeface offers and use it to its
    best advantage</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUnless you can simply jettison the sorry turd
    into outer space.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Equally unable to put my finger on the source of the discomfort, I just wanted
    to say that the typeface (Memento) feels hard to read to me as well. One thing
    I spontaneously dislike is the tight spacing. The spacing generally isn\u2019t
    great (some random examples <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-7Vp7gO\">here</a>;
    apparently nobody thought about the possibility of two consecutive forward slashes
    when the fonts were created, but words starting with \u2018Py\u2019 already existed
    in the 90s). One more downside, in my eyes, is that the regular cut looks quite
    light, even flimsy (but I\u2019m admittedly partial to \u2018darker\u2019 typefaces).
    Contrary to what somebody else said, I actually see a fair bit of contrast in
    the letters. These two factors\u2014light and some contrast\u2014might contribute
    to the bad screen rendering on some devices. When I printed out a page, things
    got a little better, but that doesn\u2019t really help when most people probably
    read the PDF."

  body: "Within certain limits, InDesign's optical spacing -- if I understand you
    aright -- is, in effect, like a multiple masters font with a width axis (for condensing/expanding).
    You can do things with such tools, but maybe different things than one might expect.
    When Minion Multiple Masters first came out, Richard Eckersley (a book designer)
    and I played around a fair bit with that axis. Richard was fond of shorter measures
    -- his favorite trim was a 5.5 x 9 (just trim off the extra half inch), or even
    a 5 x 9. To get that to look good, a shorter measure was called for. \r\n\r\nBut
    given academic prose (look at what's written in the sample we're all complaining
    about) there is a tension between the measure and number of word spaces. To justify
    a line, you vary the word spacing or hyphenate. The more word spaces there are
    on a line, the less each has to absorb the needed variance. (Yes, modern layout
    engines can automatically apply glyph scaling and tracking, but if you think that
    doesn't show beyond small amounts, we have very different eyes). It isn't the
    big words that kill you, it is the absence of short ones, with the spaces they
    bring.\r\n\r\nAnyway, using Minion MM, we played around a lot with that width
    axis, and you know, the type held up quite well. I think the space contained within
    a letter, even one open on the bottom like h, m, n, is not just a total amount
    of white, but is also in some ways set up by the curves of the letterforms. When
    they're working well, condensing a font doesn't hurt. When those relationships
    are bad, or \"fussy,\" not much helps -- you've got a one-size turd at best. (Which,
    I think, is why my biggest complaint about a number of interior designers is they
    spend too much time being tempted by letterforms, and not enough paying attention
    to how those letterforms interact.)\r\n\r\nNor do I buy Publishing Mojo's analysis,
    at least, not in toto. You can make Matthew Carter's Charter a wonderful text
    face, yet \r\n\r\n<blockquote>It has a large x-height, shortish ascenders and
    descenders, and small, blunt serifs. It also has low contrast between thick and
    thin strokes.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut I do agree we'd all live longer if a lot
    of turds were thrown out. Or not really \"turds,\" say rather, fonts that work
    best with uses other than setting extended text."

  body: "Actually InDesign's \"optical spacing\" is not like a width axis at all.
    Besides the fact that it does not provide a continuous harmonization between internal
    and external whites, it actually essentially replaces a type designer's spacing
    determinations with its own, using a clever, but of course not truly intelligent,
    algorithmic. Many people think Optical Spacing should never be used; I'm of the
    opinion that in cases where a font is very poorly spaced (but otherwise desirable)
    it can be helpful.\r\n\r\nTurds: although no font is good enough to be optimal
    in any situation, I think there most certainly are fonts that are not optimal
    in any situation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I noticed that in the bold of the original paper, using Adobe Acrobat Reader,
    letters like m, n, and r were above the baseline. However, this went away if I
    changed from \"fit width\" to a magnification that was an even multiple of 100%.
    So there may be problems with how the face is hinted.\r\n\r\nThe face is lighter
    and more condensed than the typical faces used for scientific papers. It did seem
    like the right margin was uneven in the cases where a hyphen was present, but
    I didn't notice a problem in <em>that</em> respect otherwise."

  body: "<blockquote>Many people think Optical Spacing should never be used; I'm of
    the opinion that in cases where a font is very poorly spaced (but otherwise desirable)
    it can be helpful.</blockquote>\r\nThat's kind of strange. I initially learned
    that Optical Spacing should always be used, but my own research has lead me to
    believe that for body text it's best to use Metric spacing if you're using a professional
    typeface. If the spacing isn't great Optical Spacing should be used and you may
    want to add a bit of tracking to compensate.\r\nFor titles using Optical Spacing
    may be more logical. I tend to use it by default for headings.\r\n\r\nRecently
    my typography teacher told our class to always use Optical Spacing. I think this
    is a myth going around in the design community, at least at the art academy I'm
    at. I told her what I came to understand and I think she has updated her information
    accordingly. It's kind of pleasant to hear apparently many people think Optical
    Spacing should never be used. To me it emphasizes the notion that there is middle
    ground and one should decide whether to use it or not for each individual project,
    rather than completely avoiding it or always using it by default.\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, I think I find the text from the sample hard to read because it's such a
    condensed typeface with such a tall x-height, combined with the tight spacing
    and the lack of any advanced typographic functions. I think the text would be
    much more pleasant to read if the tracking is set to 10, Story is activated and
    the settings for Justification and Hyphenation are set accordingly. Even with
    a typeface which clearly isn't optimal for reading, there's quite a bit you can
    do in InDesign to make it much more pleasant to read. "
