  things that Tracy seemed to be saying is fine type design does not include letting
  the software you're using run routines to proportionally increase and decrease the
  size of one or two sizes that you've designed.\r\n\r\nSo how many sizes do you create--I
  mean, I'm sure you can create a hundred sizes if you wanted to. But practically
  speaking, how do you handle making different sizes?\r\n\r\nAnd what about italic,
  do you simply slant a roman typeface?\r\n\r\nThese may seem like awfully basic questions,
  but since I have no burning need to do any type design until I know what the hell
  I'm doing, I figured I should gather all the info I can first.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Usually there are some different optical sizes made going from small to large,
    like: caption, body, headline and titling. These are optimised for normal sizes
    like eg. 9 or 10 for the body cut.\r\n\r\nSome typefaces have a slanted version
    instead of a true italic. That causes some problems, especially in the shapes
    of the characters a,e,f and so on \u2013 you get the idea. I suppose this was
    done so to save a bit of work in it's time before digital typefaces."

  body: "As a beginner I don't think you need to concern yourself with different sizes.
    Designing and producing one weight is difficult enough. You're becoming weighed
    down with the nitty gritty before you even start, so don't run before you can
    walk.\r\n\r\nJust buy 'Learn FontLab Fast' by Leslie Cabarga, read it, and then
    start work on one upright typeface to see if it is something you would wish to
    continue. Believe me - it is a LOT of time-consuming work with no guarantee of
    success.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to put you off - you might enjoy the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "<cite>Just buy \u2019Learn FontLab Fast\u2019 by Leslie Cabarga, read it,
    and then start work ...</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, I'm moving slowly because I'm trying
    to get a sense of what I really want in a typeface. I've said it before elsewhere:
    I can't draw a lick, and so visualizing something diffrent, but worth trying to
    bring into existence is a real issue for me. I'm also going the FontForge route,
    instead of FontLab\u2014also discussed previously and elsewhere in these parts\u2014purely
    from an economic standpoint.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, there\u2019s work obligations.
    I'm knee-deep in work and a little bit from setting aside even an hour or two
    each day to pursue this type design project. I have two books going. The first
    I'm putting into first draft pages as I write this\u2014on a break, as it were,
    before starting the day\u2019s work; and on the second, I\u2019m awaiting corrections
    amd changes. Plus there's the matter of finishing up a booklet project\u2014interior
    pages, covers, and j-cards for five booklets.\r\n\r\nSo I'm kind of dragging my
    feet, I guess, because I don't have the energy or time to plunge in. But at least
    I'm using the time to get a foundation of information that will help me with this
    project.\r\n\r\nI have heard good things about <em>Learn FontLab Fast.</em> I've
    read most of Cabarga\u2019s <em>Logo, Font & Lettering Bible</em> and I am mightily
    impressed. I wish there were a \"Learn FontForge Fast.\""

  body: "I recommend starting with Regular or Medium\r\nWhen you're happy with that,
    start your Thin and Extra Bold by pasting it into the mask/template layer.\r\nMake
    the Thin by drawing a single skeletal path and applying a stroke value of 20 units.\r\nMake
    the Extra Bold by a combination of dragging parts of the letters wider, and applying
    \"add weight\"/\"parallel path\" commands.\r\nFinally, you can use the Multiple
    Master feature to interpolate all the other weights between those three masters."

  body: "> And what about italic, do you simply slant a roman typeface?\r\n\r\nThis
    question suggests that you need to spend a lot more time looking at type. Here
    is a starting point. Find a program that will slant text for you (many can). Type
    a line in Times New Roman 24 to 36 point, make a copy, and then slant it 12 degrees.
    Convert the top line to true italics and then compare the two. \r\n\r\nDo this
    with at least 50 different fonts. Compare the differences. (You will find that
    some sans serif fonts are pretty similar but almost no serif fonts are.)\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing to do is to type similar lines in differing fonts, but the same weight and
    style (all roman or all italic). Look for the differences between the shapes of
    the characters. Once you get a good read on how the types differ, you can start
    to imagine which features you would like to use."
