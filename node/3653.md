  to splurge, so I am betting it&#39;s custom. <BR>Still, I have an inkling that I&#39;ve
  forgotten something. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28791.gif"

  body: <i>&#62; They did fix the M tho.</i> <BR> <BR>Actually we&#39;re looking at
    TF Forever Two, the version  <BR>from 1986-92 with a single-storey lc &#34;g&#34;
    and the  <BR>junction of the middle strokes of the uc &#34;M&#34; that extend  <BR>to
    the baseline. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if Joe could enlighten us; he posted  <BR>a
    comment on another thread just recently.
