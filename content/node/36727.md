  pal of mine. \r\n\r\nHere the type has been squished or squooshed- whatever- messed
  with. On top that- tacky fills and drop shadows.\r\n\r\nMy friend said he got it
  in a zillion fonts for five bucks cd. I told him there must be a respectable professional
  equivalent. The fake name was something like Blue Denver or Blue Mountain- something
  like that.\r\n\r\nAny clues?\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woArt_3876.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/soaring-title_6021.jpg]"

  body: The S is the key -- no actual serifs but widening ends.

  body: "My guess is a revival of Romana or a Romana-look-alike.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/\r\nAt
    least the capital S, although being wider, has the same serifs.\r\n\r\nDe Vinne
    is even closer.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/\r\nThe
    capital T seems a better match."

  body: "Actually I finally found the exact design. It is Denver after all. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/denver/\r\n\r\nHowever
    I do wonder, since this TypeShop company appears to be a copycat foundry, what
    is the name of the original design?\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: Typeshop was Walter Brendel. Brendel did a lot of altering existing type to
    be heavier/thinner/wider/narrower to meet customer demands. He did have original
    designs, too, though. To my eye, Denver looks to be a narrowed Devinne. And perhaps
    the naming (Devinne -> Denver) would kind of reinforce that?

    don't see much of Devinne in there I do see a similarity.\r\n\r\nYves you can
    mark this one as found now. \r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
