  body: "Dan X. Solo's Boul Mich was included with the Dover Book 24 Art Deco Alphabets.
    \ Wordshape's digital version by  Ian Lynam is at http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T3153/boul-mich?affid=143174
    Unless you can buy a copy of the Dover book, the only legitimate way to get Boul
    Mich is to purchase Ian Lynam's version. The Solo version is more artistically
    pleasing for some glyphs, such as the _8_, but the Lynam version is more precisely
    engineered. Both versions could be improved from a technical point of view. Your
    image could be from the Solo version or from a predigital source.\r\nDon"
