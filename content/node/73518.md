  short time that computers have been a way of life.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of disappointment
  that Hoefler & Frere-Jones, among others, don't make samples available in pdf format.
  I understand why they don't (there are enough threads on this forum about intellectual
  property theft etc.) but I find some of the pdfs offered on some  websites border
  on sublime perfection.\r\n\r\nClearly there are berzillions of pdfs out there but,
  if you had to, what would you say were your favourite type-related pdf downloads
  and, if it needs stating (which I very much doubt), why?\r\n\r\nLet me kick off
  proceedings with with <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tss/workingdrawings/alphabet/th2transportheavyalphabet.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\">this beauty</a> from the United Kingdom's Department of Transport."

  body: "After my last release I decided to stop producing big PDF specimens because
    very few people download them at all, so they have little impact on font sales.
    It makes more sense to put my effort into the little 720x360 pixel specimens because
    that\u2019s what get people to buy a font. Other type designers download the PDFs,
    but they don\u2019t buy type!"

    the Armitage page at dunwichtype.com see at least some of the 720x360 images,
    but only 10% viewed the thirty page PDF. "

  body: James, fair comment but are you telling me you have never appreciated anyone
    else's pd-efforts, like I've now had a chance to with your <a href="http://dunwichtype.com/pdfs/TypeTrust-Recovery.pdf"
    target="_blank">Recovery</a> and <a href="http://dunwichtype.com/pdfs/DTF_Armitage_Specimen.pdf"
    target="_blank">Armitage</a> etc.? I was hoping for lots of inspiring links to
    pdf masterpieces.

    specimens ;) Anyway, the specimens that Scott and Nix have done for <a href=\"http://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/SevenOneEight\">Terminal
    Design</a> are wonderful\u2014you print them out and fold them into little books!"

  body: Yes, agreed about Terminal Design. I also bitterly regret not adding <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/pdfs/underground.pdf"
    target="_blank">this beauty</a> by Paul D. Hunt, without which no pdf type collection
    is complete, although I also love the TfL's brand pdfs, of which <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/lu-basic-elements-standard-issue02.pdf"
    target="_blank">this</a> is a good example.
