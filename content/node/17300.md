body: A really rough job of redrawing the Koster font, from poor images. It was just
  a quick job but this shows some of the variations that there was. The Kerning was
  not enacted here, but had to hand do all of them one by one.

  body: "FYI -- From a collection of old metal fonts that a friend pulled samples
    during the mid-seventies, I have this poor repro showing that the cap \"Q\" uses
    the same ornamental treatment as the cap \"C\" on the top. He called design <em>Antique
    Initials 2</em> because I don't think he was able to identify it... neither could
    I.\r\n\r\nIt may be due to the point size sample or the poor repro, but it looks
    like the \"crown\" ornament on the cap \"C\" and \"Q\" are a slight bit more delicate
    than in your redrawing. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ant_init3.png]\r\nIn
    the specimen above, the \"X\" was originally upside down which I corrected in
    Photoshop, but I believe the cap \"S\" is still upside down.\r\n\r\nThe sample
    below was originally posted by Mark Simonson, which shows the same treatment of
    the cap \"Q\" that you rendered. Between the two samples you will spot minor variants
    in drawing like the additional swash on cap \"S\". Hope this helps to round out
    your source material.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Koster_Simonson.gif]"

    show what state up to, but more a sort of fishing trip. Could we have a fishing
    trip forum :)?\r\n\r\nChange it over to where you would have expected it to be
    if you wish.\r\n\r\n"

    a look/check for me, if anyone wanted to. That way I get a proper opinion instead
    of from an image.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
