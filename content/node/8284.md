  body: You could also check out House&#39;s <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTCOND-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Neutraface Condensed Thin</a>. It hasn&#39;t got quite the personality
    of your sample but shares some characteristics. If you&#39;re going for the deco
    feel but don&#39;t need an exact font match there are a LOT of free &#40;and legal&#41;
    fonts at <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/a.htm"
    target="_blank">TypOasis</a>.
