  body: 'Ok. I&#39;ve re-read the script. I&#39;m pretty sure that this story is being
    told from the child&#39;s POV. It is, actually, more of a long poem set into a
    book. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t show you text or images so I know this makes it into

  body: Tempus and Tempus Sans are not chidlike, but they are quite playful, but still
    very readable. I don&#39;t know if they suit your project, but they are a masterful
    version of this kind of thing.

  body: 'Yes, if the text is short, actually lettering it is the best thing. If you
    are not a letterer, getting a great letterer like Mark Simonson might be the best
    route, if the publisher can afford it. An actual child&#39;s writing might be
    too undisciplined for readability, but you could try it, as Po-Hsuan suggests. '

  body: After sleeping on it for one night. I&#39;ve decided, as some of you have
    suggested to pursue handlettering as an option. The illustrator also has a very
    unique lettering style that would fit right alongside her illustrations. This
    is only for a comp to present to the publisher&#39;s. They have approved the manuscript,
    but we are now onto getting the artwork approved. One step at a time.  <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Take P22&#39;s advice, if you want a handwritten font, then hand write it.
    No digital face can express what the hand can do. Script fonts look fake in my
    eyes. <BR> <BR>

  body: i agree.. digital handwritten fonts never look quite right. probably because
    as each character is repeated, it is the exact same glyph, unlike what happnens
    when something is actually hand written.  <BR> <BR>on a side note.. does anybody
    know if there are any, or if it is possible to make a font where you have several
    &#40;maybe 5 or so&#41; glyphs for each character that are used at random when
    typing? I always thought this would be something that would help a handwritten
    digital face look more authentic. <BR> <BR>Joe- thats a great link, i enjoyed
    seeing holly&#39;s work.. very inspirational.

    seeing some of the drawings of the illustrator, yes Tiffanny it is a PITA, they
    have to work so well together...  <BR> <BR>You could also take a look at the  <a

  body: '&#62; probably because as each character is repeated <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve come
    to the tentative conclusion that the necessity for letterform &#34;randomness&#34;
    is limited to foveation. What I mean is that as long as the font uses 3 or 4 variants
    of a glyph &#40;which is the most we can see in the fovea at one time, and that&#39;s
    assuming 3 or 4 of the same letter ever actually happens in sequence...&#41; it&#39;s
    OK, because short-term memory concerning exact glyph shapes probably doesn&#39;t
    survive a saccade. Interestingly, Letterror&#39;s FF Kosmik-Flipper uses 3 variants
    per character. <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ve also come to realize there&#39;s a much bigger
    problem: handwritten stuff typically has <i>mistakes</i> in it, which can either
    be corrected -but visibly- or just left in. This means you need some fancy software
    to replicate that in order for something to truly appear handwritten... <BR> <BR>hhp
