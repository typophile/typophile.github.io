  about Neue Helvetica on my blog and then Erik Spiekermann joined in (as he was a
  design consultant for the face) and things got awesome. Today he emailed me some
  scans of the original marketing materials from the 80's. You can download and view
  them from the article's comments section. I hope you like it.\r\n\r\n[[http://travisneilson.com/thought/old-vs-neue/]]"

    is superior for print.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the article was great. Thanks for sharing
    that with us."

  body: "Thanks for liking the article. I appreciate the read. I did not, however,
    conclude that Neue Helvetica was superior. In fact what I said was:\r\n\r\n\"Of
    course this study only concerns two weights from each family, and is therefore
    slightly limited in its scope.\r\nI am not recommending that in all cases this
    is true for all applications, but for this study, the winner is Hel\xADvetica
    Neue with three out of four votes!\"\r\n\r\nI have not heard that the original
    Helvetica is better for print before. Why do you say so? Is that your opinion,
    or is there data to back that up?"

  body: "The redesign of Helvetica Neue to make the characters a little more structurally
    unified fits better to the pixel grid (or at least seems to), making it easier
    to read on screen. The slight differences that the original Helvetica has between
    characters (well, the ones the Neue alters) make it easier to read on print (by
    making the characters more distinguishable).\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, I'll pull a quote
    from your article to get the true opinion flowing:\r\n\"For the longest time I
    used Helvetica and Helvetica Neue interchangeably and really had no preference
    for either of them.\"  One just does one job slightly better than the other, that's
    about it.\r\n\r\nRegarding your opinion on which is superior, I was referring
    to the section just above that block of text. It seemed to be implied that your
    preference was very slightly towards Neue."

    superior over the other.\r\n\r\nAs for Neue Helvetica, it renders absolutely horribly
    on the web in Windows. I don't know how Helvetica performed on the web, but everything
    set in Neue Helvetica actually discourages reading as it's just so uncomfortable.
    I much rather read Arial on the web. Neue Helvetica requires another upgrade:
    Neuest Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI'm curious about those scans as well."
