  body: "Don't do things like this. \r\n\r\nMaybe, if your font is intended for dilettantes'
    only -- an author who will not ever make use of an editor, designer, or compositor,
    and whose work will <strong>never, ever</strong> be rendered in any font other
    than yours, and where no XML document will ever be needed, it is passable, but
    not really.\r\n\r\nUnicode is suppose to end all the nonsense of special encodings
    -- what character you get depends on what font you're in -- and that means ccmp
    should allow decompiling to canonical Unicode. Look up the proper form.\r\n\r\nAnd
    take some pity on the poor editor, designer, typesetter, too.  The author will
    supply his/her text in Times, (or Gentium if everyone's terribly lucky), and someone's
    going to have to figure out how to use your font with the text string supplied.
    \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, what does \r\n\r\nsub d-ae-1 uni030A by d-ae1-1;\r\n\r\ninvolve?
    \r\n\r\na <strong>d</strong>, ligatured with an <strong>ash</strong> character
    (variant 1) with a <strong>ring accent</strong>?\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, I'd
    make up the ash with a ring & substitute variant one in the same set where I substituted
    the variant ash character, then lig it with the d.\r\n\r\nAnd if ae is a ligature
    rather than the ash character, make that clear (work), too.\r\n\r\nEverything
    should all work seamlessly with your font if the (original) text stream is in
    canonically correct Unicode, with the designer/typesetter having to figure out
    only which character variant to select. And once a pdf is made, extracting text
    should be seamless, too.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAs for debugging, the old rule is
    get something that works, and add one thing until that works, too. Then add the
    next. In a play file. You've got my sympathy here -- been there.\r\n"
