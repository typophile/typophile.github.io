<p>The principal benefit I can think of to handling set-width spaces at the glyph level in fonts, rather than in distance offsets in layout software, is that these glyphs are then available for inclusion in OpenType Layout lookups. I can think of situations in which it might be appropriate, for example, for a contextual substitution that takes places across a standard word space to also be triggered across other kinds of spaces.</p>

If, on the other hand, you take the comp&rsquo;s point of view &ndash; that the type designer&rsquo;s job is to furnish tools &ndash; you should include them.</p>
<p>Put rather pointedly, I&rsquo;ll allow.</p>
<p>For many years I was use to a typesetting program (TeX) where the comp could specify any needed space on the fly. InDesign doesn&rsquo;t provide for this; I find I miss it. I do use the figure space and punctuation space routinely when setting tables. Yes, I know you can use ID&rsquo;s decimal alignment, but fairly often you get a longish column where only one or two numbers need &ldquo;padding&rdquo; with white space, and it is just easier to add them &amp; center the whole thing with the column head.</p>
<p>BTW, there is a bug, apparently in InDesign CS4, Windows only, where if nine of these spaces (uni 2000-200B) occur on a line, and if &ldquo;show hidden characters&rdquo; is switched on, the program crashes. Miguel has tested this, and assures us it will not occur in the CS5. Got to be one of the worlds oddest bugs.</p>

<p>If one can make a strong enough case that there are circumstances in which an entity needs to be distinguished in plain text, such that the distinction will not be lost in text interchange, then it will probably end up encoded as a character. But those circumstances may be quite precise and limited, sometimes to specialist usage, and the use of that character for some other more general purpose &ndash; e.g. using particular width space characters as design elements &ndash; is often inadvisable.</p>

<p>Personally, I have long been of the latter POV, but I don&rsquo;t think the people who want to omit them are crazy, either. So I didn&rsquo;t argue the point too strenuously when over-ruled on this question at Adobe.</p>

In InDesign, you can only use predefined spaces. Unfortunately with some fonts, you won&rsquo;t find the right space, it&rsquo;ll be either too much or not enough. Reason why I&rsquo;d like to be able to set a value, which could be available as &ldquo;Custom Space&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Insert White Space&rdquo; menu.
Anyone knows why this option doesn&rsquo;t exist in InDesign, or shall I study the manual closely, if it is?</div>

<p>I think the difference is that a font is allowed to ‘lie’ about one set, but not about the other. For example, in a very narrow compressed or very wide expanded font, the nominally en/em characters might actually be proportionally narrower or wider than actual width relative to body height.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the en/em quad characters are the ones that should be fixed relative to the body height, but am not 100% sure about that.</p>

<p>Problem is that encoding these spaces creates expectation that they should be present in fonts. (Complaint: Missing!) And type designers who add them likely interpret the use and thus width of these spaces differently, so that hair space might be visibly different in different fonts.* (Complaint: Not the width I expected!) They more &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; for end users to modify fonts.**</p>
<p>Worse, they obscure the idea of what encoding characters means. The Unicode 5 book, p.205, suggests that
<cite>U+2009 THIN SPACE and U+200A HAIR SPACE are successively smaller-width spaces used for narrow word gaps and for justification of type</p>
<p>where, in my understanding, &ldquo;narrow word gaps&rdquo; refer to the text level while &ldquo;justification of type&rdquo; (things like adjusting uppercase spacing?) is not a matter of text encoding but of design. Inviting to produce ambiguous data: when is thin/hair space a real space, when does it serve as design hack?</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicode 5, p.205, says:
<cite>where they</cite> [u-2000..U+200A except sometimes U+2009] <cite>are used (for example, in typesetting mathematical formulae), their width is generally font-specific</cite></li>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never accepted the argument that just because something is in Unicode it should be in any font, let alone all fonts. Glyph sets are determined by font makers. Unless you are claiming support for a character set that includes characters that you don&rsquo;t in fact support, those characters can&rsquo;t be considered missing.</p>
<p>I do put these space characters into my fonts, but that&rsquo;s because I know they are useful for scholars dealing with manuscript transcription in which capturing different widths of spaces in plain text can be important, and my clients tend to request them.</p>
<p>FWIW, these are the space widths I use in fonts (most are obvious):</p>
<p>U+2000 |enquad| 1/2em
U+2001 |emquad| 1em
U+2002 |enspace| 1/2em
U+2003 |emspace| 1em
U+2004 |thirdemspace| 1/3em
U+2005 |quarteremspace| 1/4em
U+2006 |sixthemspace| 1/6em
U+2007 |figurespace| tabular numeral width
U+2008 |punctuationspace/ comma width
U+2009 |thinspace| 1/5em <em>or</em> 2/3wordspace (whichever is narrower)
U+200A |hairspace| 1/18em
U+202F |NBSPnarrow| 1/5em (or 1/3em for Mongolian fonts)
U+205F |mathspacemedium| 1/4em</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kent, this is why I fill in those Unicode characters. The <em>figure space</em> gets the width of a tabular figure, the <em>punctuation space</em> the width of a tabular comma, which I sometimes make up &amp; switch with the regular comma &ndash; Minion needs one, for example. When I need one of these spaces, I enter the Unicode from the keyboard rather than counting on InDesign to figure it out.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, but I use a 155 unit space for a thin, and a 55 unit space for the hair space &ndash; same as John with the hair, &amp; real close with the thin.</p>
<p>There is some precedent for varying hair space values; what a comp setting metal actually used for a hair space was &ldquo;whatever suited.&rdquo; The thin space is a different matter; in Linotype is was the spaceband, unexpanded (you could switch in different spacebands). For systems using the em, I&rsquo;d imagine it varied as well.</p>
<p>BTW, not all fonts have the same width for lining tabular figures as for oldstyle tabular figures. Well, it&rsquo;s not ideal, but you can live with that. What you can&rsquo;t live with are those fonts where the setwidth for roman tabular figures is different than for italic tabular figures. Ah, font designers. Why end users have to modify fonts.</p>

<p>I just thought, that it would be handy to have an embedded font in the css stack, that contains only different spacing characters. Up till now I used the span-tag in cases, in which the spacing was very bad, but this soils the markup more than having a font just for such extra spaces.</p>

<p>I don’t know, if the problem is already solved in Firefox, but if you change the leading with the help of CSS with a relative value, it can happen, that one line is one pixel higher than the following one. I found this very bothering, because one pixel more or less is visible. So it would be possible to provide a font in the first place of the stack with a higher space for long lines for the case that Mozilla will not fix this bug (caused by too strictly following the specification). In the Internet Explorer the leading is even.</p>

<p>I should&rsquo;ve thought of it earlier &ndash; since InDesign CS4 you can use a GREP style to apply the horizontal scale to em-spaces <em>only</em>. A GREP style only can apply character styles, which is sometimes annoying (just a little!), but in this case it&rsquo;s an advantage because you can change the scale in that style, and it&rsquo;ll be changed all over your document.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting? Create a new GREP style. In the Apply Style list, choose &ldquo;New Character Style&rdquo;. Select this and name it &ldquo;em width&rdquo;.
In the To Text box put &ldquo;~m&rdquo; (<em>sans</em> quotes, of course). Insert a number of ems into your document &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to apply the style manually &ndash;, then change the horizontal scale in the &ldquo;em width&rdquo; character style to 50% and 200% to see what happens.</p>

<p>Until you have won the TypeCon quiz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To cop William Buckley&rsquo;s famous line from 1965&rsquo;s New York Mayoralty campaign - if I were to win, the first thing I would do is demand a recount.</p>
<p>Spacing glyphs, spacing glyphs&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a Beta tester, I <a href="http://readableweb.com/ie8-bug-html-spacer-entities-create-one-pixel-jog-in-line-height/">reported a bug</a> in IE8 on Windows XP (only XP) that caused a 1 pixel &ldquo;jog&rdquo; in line height when the author used one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html">HTML character entities</a> like &amp;thinsp; or &amp;emsp;
However, if the font contained the character corresponding to those entities, the bug went away. It was a problem related to whatever way IE8 was synthesizing the character - at least on XP.
But it was filed too late in the game and perhaps not deemed critical enough and IE8 shipped with it.
This was one clue that including spacing characters in the font was, perhaps, a good idea. After all, why rely on UA synthesis if you don&rsquo;t have to?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe Clark stopped by Readable Web to make a snide <a href="http://readableweb.com/ie8-bug-html-spacer-entities-create-one-pixel-jog-in-line-height/#comment-14">comment</a> about my using HTML Character Entities for spacing.
Which read:
<em>You mean you’re using “spacer entities” (fun neologism, BTW) just like spacer GIFs? Because they’re easier than CSS?
You’re so 2009 you’re 1997!</em>
I replied with an apt example and, credit to Joe for re-thinking when re-thinking is due, he seems to have come around to the wisdom of using spacing characters in certain situations:
<a href="http://blog.fawny.org/2009/10/24/thinspace/">Talking With The Taxman About Thin Spaces</a>
These entities are part of the specs - both HTML and Unicode - and they do effortlessly what, in some situations, could take many lines of fitful CSS and added HTML span elements. (And, without going into a lot of detail and explaining why it&rsquo;s important, I can tell you firsthand that if you want to get decent H&amp;J text out of a browser, these glyphs are indispensable.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if the glyph is not in the font, there&rsquo;s a disconnect with the CSS spec. If you read the spec carefully, you see that the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; behavior for a browser - if it cannot find the corresponding glyph in any of the fonts in the font stack - is to display the rectangular &ldquo;character not found&rdquo; box. This is what Opera does. IE and some other browsers, more practically, will attempt to synthesize the space. But Opera&rsquo;s unsightly behavior is actually correct.</p>
<p>And, as you can see from Kent&rsquo;s analysis of InDesign&rsquo;s behavior, even a high-end app can be weird about the math, let alone a browser you get for free.</p>
<p>In line with Phinney: why not add certainty when it &ldquo;costs&rdquo; nothing?
Including these glyphs should be de rigeur.</p>
<p>Where they don&rsquo;t exist, I add them.</p>

<p>My guess is that IE was using font swapping (if I recall correctly, a function of RichEdit) as do a lot of other MS apps. So instead of displaying a .notdef glyph for the unsupported character, a different font is used to display the character (typically an MS core font). The reason for the linegap jump is that the substituted font has larger vertical metrics than the other font.</p>

<p>With regard to the thin and hair spaces, at least, this isn’t really a fair accusation. There is no standard width for these. So, I’m not sure that you’re going to be a whole lot more satisfied having the type designer define these willy-nilly either. (We all know how capricious they can be ;-)</p>
<p>Unlike the objective, relative, nominal spaces (3-to-em, 4-to-em, et al.), there is no objective definition for a thin space. I believe the Unicode spec says “a fifth of an em (or sometimes a sixth)” — well, which is it? And some comps might say, Neither. (I happen to like 8-to-em thin spaces.) If the intention was to encode a 5-to-em space, then it should have been called as such.</p>
<p>Back in the day, there may have been a generally shared understanding within certain typesetting shops of what one meant by a thin space, but the truth of the matter is that this will have varied between shops and typesetters.</p>
<p>In fact, the term <em>thin space</em> was also used generically, as in “one of the thin spaces,” referring to several different spaces up to about a fifth of an em — spaces such as a copper or a brass (which James facetiously referred to above) or even a hair space.</p>
<p>And a <em>hair space</em> usually just meant “some small amount of space to make it look good.” Often a comp might just use a scrap of card stock or a piece or two of cigarette paper.</p>
<p>So, I wonder at the wisdom of encoding these subjective spaces. Might just as well encode a <em>tad</em> — “Hey, would you space that out a tad, please?” “I think that could use a tad less space.”</p>
<p>At least a copper and a brass had definite measurements. But these were absolute spaces, not relative. A <em>copper</em> referred to a half-point space, and a <em>brass</em> referred to a one-point space. (These were provided in the different metals to make them easily distinguishable at a glance.)</p>
<p>The reason James’s reference above is amusing is that you can’t realistically provide for these in a digital font. A “brass” in a 12-point font would have a value of 83 em units; but set in an 8-point font, it should be 125 em units; etc.</p>

<p><em>Oh, you and Joe have made compelling arguments for including them in any font destined for web use, certainly.</em></p>
<p>Me, Joe and, apparently, Microsoft.
As sii posted:
<em>we had bugs related to &ldquo;square boxes&rdquo; logged against various fonts</em></p>
<p>So my question now is: if one of these characters have been added to a font, does an app like InDesign use them? Or does it continue to just do the math and synthesize?
(BTW - in my previous life I spent quite a bit of time with tool-and-die guys. Apropos of &ldquo;hair space&rdquo; - do typographers ever use the term politely abbreviated as CH? And if so, is there any distinction made between a red CH and a blonde CH? [Lascivious giggling allowed.]
Didn&rsquo;t hear &ldquo;tad&rdquo; used at all in any shop - too imprecise.)
Interestingly, steel rule cutting dies use the point system for the width of the steel - like type. Never found out the history of it, though.</p>
<p>@thomas phinney
<em>it&rsquo;s the kind of thing one would expect to throw in near the end</em>
Absolutely. And as you say - there&rsquo;s no glyph data - it adds next to nothing to the file size.</p>

<p><cite>So my question now is: if one of these characters have been added to a font, does an app like InDesign use them? Or does it continue to just do the math and synthesize?</cite></p>
<p>There was a thread on this a while ago where it was mentioned someone had made a special &ldquo;non-breaking space&rdquo; glyph. In one of the older CSes, the glyph was invisible and ID substituted its own: a regular space with software-supported non breaking properties. After a wee bit o' complainin', the next major release featured the logical way: use the font&rsquo;s own glyph (whether or not it has &ldquo;ink&rdquo; on it) if it&rsquo;s there &ndash; and presumably its width as well &ndash;, synthesize if it&rsquo;s not in there.</p>
<p>If you have a recent InDesign and a program to quickly draw some glyphs, you could try if that holds for all spacing glyphs. (And it&rsquo;d better! Would Adobe fall for the same trick twice?)</p>
<p>Three glyphs that are not mentioned so far are a bit of a mystery to me: The En and Em Quads (U+2000, U+2001), and the NEL (Next Line) character U+0085. Are these deprecated? [*]</p>
<p>A mean thing to stress-test InDesign with would be to proffer it a font with glyphs for the Zero Width Space (U+200B), Zero Width Non-Joiner (U+200C) and Zero Width Joiner (U+200D) &ndash; all of course <em>with</em> a width. [Imagine Devilish Grin Here]</p>
<p>[*] Okay, I see <em>you</em> listed the quads. :-P</p>

<p>If any of the subjective spaces I mentioned (hairspace, thinspace, punctuationspace, figurespace) is present and properly encoded in the font, it appears that InDesign will respect and use them. I don’t know about the nominal spaces. I’d have to rig a font with incorrect widths and see whether they showed up right or wrong. I’d expect that InDesign will respect any encoded space, that the calculated spaces are just fall-backs, but I haven’t tried.</p>
<p>Oh, but when I entered the nominal spaces in an earlier test and exported the result, they were encoded, so that’s further indication that Indd will probably respect the font.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a little fuzzy about what these zero width chars are meant to accomplish, exactly. I do know that 8203 will signal to the browser where, in an unbroken string, the string is to be wrapped to a new line. Handy for URLs and the like. It can prevent unsightly overflow or large gaps at the ends of lines.
Plus, it seems to be well-supported by browsers, generally. Although I haven&rsquo;t done extensive tests of all the major browsers.</p>
<p>@kent</p>
<p>Thanks for checking it out. What you found was what I expected - first, it looks for a corresponding glyph and if not found, it synthesizes one based on, I assume, the UPM.
Of course, with browsers, we have the fallback font to contend with.
Based on what Sii is saying, it looks like, as of Win 7, in Windows the browser will always find a corresponding glyph because it will keeping looking down the font stack until it hits the final built in fallbacks: serif or sans-serif or monospace.</p>
<p>Hey, want to see something? Remember my thread about duplicate font names?
Take a funky looking font, rename it &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; and install it.
It won&rsquo;t happen on every site, but sooner or later you&rsquo;ll see that font pop up unexpectedly because nearly all browsers still don&rsquo;t make the distinction between:
font-family: &lsquo;inherit&rsquo;;
and
font-family:inherit;
(Inherit is CSS for &ldquo;apply the same font-family to this HTML element as is being applied to its parent element&rdquo;.)
They are supposed to make this distinction, of course. If quoted it&rsquo;s a legit font name, unquoted it&rsquo;s the CSS value.
Oops.
I&rsquo;m afraid to see what happens if I name a font <em>serif</em> or <em>sans-serif</em>!</p>

<p>Well, for InDesign anyway, it’s not necessary to reference the UPM. Remember, the em is relative to point size, which is being declared at the layout level, not the font level.</p>
<p>So, only in the case of punctuationspace and figurespace does it need to give any deeper consideration to the specifics of the font. To synthesize, it would need to read out the specific width value of the period (for punctuationspace) or zero (for figurespace), and then factor in UPM. Something like that.</p>

<p><em>Remember, the em is relative to point size, which is being declared at the layout level, not the font level.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. What I meant was - say a four-per-em space - would have a width in the font that&rsquo;s 25% of the UPM. If 1000, then 250, if 2048, then 512. And, of course, that&rsquo;s going to scale up and down (or more like out and in) depending upon the point size.</p>
<p>And, no sooner do we speak, but look at my previous comment with the italic <em>f</em> bumping into the exclamation point at the sentence ending with <em>serif</em>!
(Should I have italicized the exclamation point also? What would you do?)</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s what Joe C&rsquo;s been carping about. If the needed space doesn&rsquo;t exist in the font, then the browser should try to synthesize. But stupidly, the CSS spec actually reads that if it can&rsquo;t be found in any font in the stack, the notdef black box is what gets displayed.
Actually, I really should take a look and see what the status is on that in the current flurry of revisions at the W3C. Maybe make the suggestion. In the case of spacing characters, notdef just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We’re basically on the same page, so it may just be semantics; but my understanding is that, for any given character, the app has to calculate width ÷ UPM * point-size to figure out how big to render. I believe points are the base units for the type handling at the app level, not UPM em units.</p>
<p>So my point is, if the space is not encoded in the font and it has to synthesize, why would it go all the way back to reading the UPM to then determine how many em units will yield one-quarter, and then turn around and divide by the UPM to return 0.25 in order to multiply by the point size to then render the four-to-em space.

<p>Exactly. I agree. That’s the way it should be.</p>
<p>And so, back to where we started, re: your initial question — Since the onus in the past has been generally on the typesetting system or software, most font makers have probably just figured that’s what was already happening and haven’t been in the habit of encoding those spaces.</p>

<li>Unicode attempts to encode existing computer character sets, several of which included space characters</li>

Unicode contributors with typographic knowledge (viz Everson) generalize from nonbreaking-space case and include all known space characters of yore</li>
