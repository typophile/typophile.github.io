  purpose of selling children\u2019s clothes. Age 0-8 years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I need
  some inspiration/suggestions for a feminine font. The product is called \"botop.dk\"
  so the font needs to be a bit characteristic and girly ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n/Henriko "

    Strada</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Cocon&x=0&y=0\">FF Cocon</a>?\r\nWith
    the half-rounded terminals, without getting <em>too</em> soft."

    <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Kontour/Odile/mudTyper+Weights/">Odile</a> by <a
    href="http://kontour.com/">Sibylle Hagmann</a>, which has a 'feminine' feel without
    being obvious or cliched.
