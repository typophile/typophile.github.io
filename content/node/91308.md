  energy/focus. On the other hand, when\r\nyou provide one service people might stick
  around\r\nfor another, and even start helping others.\r\n\r\nEspecially if there
  will not be a way to filter the\r\nbrowsing experience on Typophile, I suggest that\r\nPunchcut
  conduct a quick statistical analysis that\r\naims to find out: what proportion of
  people who ask\r\nfor type IDs never do anything else here. If we find\r\nthat most
  people who get IDs here only use this site\r\nfor that purpose, I propose that we
  start charging\r\nUS$1 per ID request.\r\n\r\nAlthough this might raise a modest
  sum over time,\r\nthe main goal is to discourage ID parasitism. But that's\r\nassuming
  ID requesters don't hang around for much\r\nelse; if they do, I for one wouldn't
  mind keeping it free,\r\nbut then filtering would be needed after all.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Well, this is a problem not with the /tracker or the noise or new users posting
    into whatever default section, but with the lack of basic usability provisions
    on the forum. The /tracker should allow subscriptions to the forums you are interested
    in. It should allow subscribing to new posts of the users you are interested in.
    It should allow subscribing to the new comments in the posts you are interested
    in. This is trivial to implement. Like "few hours of poking around the code" trivial.
    The fact none of this has been done in - what? - 10 years of Typophile's existence
    just shows that it is not likely to be ever done at all. Making members' lives
    on the forum more comfortable is clearly not a priority for Typophile's admins.

    will be greatly reduced. I think most who use that forum are those who wouldn't
    pay. And those that are left over are very few and far between. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    we could create one of those quick question forms for them to check a box or two
    about what and why they use the Type ID forum before they can post up their request?
    In that way we could glean the info needed to create a user fee or not. That form
    alone will knock down traffic.\r\n\r\n"
