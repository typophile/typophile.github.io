  body: I think it <i>IS</i>, but they customized it a bit to make the  <BR>logo more
    unique. Somebody else&#39;s got an idea?

  body: I agree Yves. The S, Q, and of course the E have been modified, but those
    are all very simple changes. &#40;Make the new Q from an O, for example.&#41;

  body: I think is NOT bank gothic, because is used in magazines, etc, have all letters
    A-Z, it is another.  <BR> <BR>Pay attention to the OBSCURE text, from the cover
    of this magazine. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40732.jpg"

  body: Javi-Chan, the &#34;OBSCURE&#34; looks like it&#39;s probably unadulterated
    Bank Gothic. Note that the S is different from the one in &#34;Square.&#34; The
    one in &#34;OBSCURE&#34; is the real Bank Gothic S. They must have simply customized
    it for that one logo and used it as is for the rest of the magazine.

  body: We cannot see enough detail of the magazine text OBSCURE to see that it is
    different from Bank Gothic. Can you enlarge the part of the magazine that shows
    these letters? <BR> <BR>I will try to show you how easily Bank Gothic can be made
    to look like SQUARE ENIX in another post in a few minutes.

  body: Bank Gothic looks pretty close to me for the &#34;Obscure&#34; word... the
    S, R and E look identical.

  body: Here is your sample followed by one I created from Bank Gothic BT. I only
    had the Medium weight, so I added stroke thickness. I used four white rectangles
    to modify the S &#40;2 places&#41; and the two E&#39;s, by hiding parts of them.
    I used 2 red rectangles to make the bars for the E&#39;s, and I used a black rectangle
    to add a tail to an O to make the Q. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40744.gif"

  body: It might have been based off of a different Bank Gothic than the one you have,
    Javi... the various digital versions of Bank Gothic differ in width. The <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/">Bitstream
    version</a> seems slightly wider than the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bank-gothic-ef/">E&amp;F
    version</a> -- maybe this is based off of E&amp;F&#39;s. Another possibility is
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/">Banque Gothique
    RR</a>, but this one seems wider also.
