body: '[[Gerard Unger]]''s [[Swift]] is a trend setting typeface, marred only by its
  lack of a [[Bold Italic]], like many other of Unger''s type designs. Why did he
  choose not to design Bold Italics? Any ideas?'

  body: Sounds like you need to license Swift 2.0 ... the first version did not have
    a bold italic.

    or you could call it capricious &#40;or rebellious&#41; anachronism. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I don&#39;t know about Swift 1.0 or its history, but don&#39;t you think that
    in some cases the client simply didn&#39;t want/need a bold italic and so it wasn&#39;t
    in the budget?

  body: An OpenType version of Swift 1.0, as well as several other typefaces from
    the Dr.-Ing Rudolf Hell archive, will be available in OpenType format shortly.
    I just rekeyed Swift into the database a few weeks ago; can&#39;t remember if
    the OpenType version had a bold italic though. I&#39;ll check tomorrow.

  body: And as a type designer it&#39;s hell to make the bold itallic weight. Not
    only do you have to make adjustments from regular, but also count for all the
    changes of details and angels as well. <BR>I wonder if the old masters felt the
    same &#40;apart from the general opinion that body copy didn&#39;t needed a bold
    italic&#41;? <BR> <BR>Cheers/SH

    is it being rereleased by Linotype while the  <BR>superior 2.0 is available <a

  body: Yves, we are converting our Hell Typefaces archive to OpenType. Most of those
    typefaces were designed by Hermann Zapf and Gerard Unger. Swift is just part of
    the general archive, whose fonts will now finally be available in OpenType. Unger&#39;s
    selling of Swift 2.0 is a separate enterprise. <BR> <BR>On another note, there
    are several versions of many typeface families within the Linotype Library. Helvetica
    has Helvetica, Helvetica Neue, and Helvetica Linotype &#40;OpenType fonts optimized
    for Office use&#41;. Palatino also has the old digital version, the Palatino Linotype
    done for Microsoft, and soon the new Palatino nova. When new releases of old fonts
    are brought into the library, the old ones normally stay in, too. There are still
    good typefaces, too.

  body: From what I&#39;ve heard the difference between Swift 1 &amp; 2 is not huge.
    But if you can afford to help out the designer directly, that&#39;s always good
    - and you <i>will</i> get something better. <BR> <BR>hhp
