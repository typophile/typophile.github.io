    target=\"new\">here</a>. Maybe a customization or slightly variant rendition of
    Bernhard's design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Good one Paul! \r\n\r\nIf the design dates are right, Willard Sniffin 'designed'
    his typeface two years after Lucien Bernhard did it in 1925, and the history of
    ATF being what it was, 'Liberty' was obviously their way of being able to sell
    something that was almost identical to Bernhard's typeface here in the U.S. \r\n\r\nI
    think Norbert deserves partial credit, at least, for the ID.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Nope... \r\nPaul really had to dig deeper to find that forgotten ATF cut.\r\nI
    just looked and felt it must have been one of Lucian Bernhard's designs (thus
    Mike and I question details). It's all in the details.\r\n\r\nGood one, Paul."
