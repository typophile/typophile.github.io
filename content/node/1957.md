body: 'Hey everyone, <BR> <BR>A fellow student and I are creating a design studio
  freelance gig thing for a credit here. We came up with the name Letter Studio and
  now  we&#39;re working on a logo. There are several issues we have come up with
  in regards to these designs. <BR> <BR>Our idea was to have the T also look like
  an &#39;H&#39;  to represent us, our last names being Helms and Heffron.. its also
  split into two halfs. Do the two t&#39;s on  #3 look like  &#39; F &#39;s ? Is the
  nature of the top of the &#39; L&#39;  less comfortable as far as readability? <BR>
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for any comments. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19852.gif"

    read &#34;letter&#34;. <BR>But I don&#39;t get the &#34;r&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Yeah, what he said. what is up with your &#34;r&#34;? you <BR>might want to
    try and regulate your x-height. It jumps <BR>around too much. It looks like there
    are 4 different <BR>glyphs.

  body: Join the t&#39;s and change the tint of the t&#39;s to contrast with the other
    letters or it will never work as an H. I agree with Hrant and Kris the r comes
    out of left field. Dan

    alt="letter 2"> <BR> <BR>Do the two t&#39;s look too much like an H when joined?
    We want the &#39;h&#39; to be more subtle.. I dont know. Yeah the &#39;r&#39;
    really doesnt flow right to me.. I think I&#39;m heading in the right direction.

  body: Drew, this last sample you posted, second one down ... try moving the t&#39;s
    a bit closer &#40;not touching&#41; but flip the second one horizontally so the
    curves both point inward. Maybe the eye will catch onto the curves and follow
    them downward completely the H?? <BR> <BR>I agree that the r seems odd.

  body: 'Drew. <BR> <BR>Your getting lots of suggestions. Here&#39;s a few more: <BR>Try
    that curve on the inside of the e&#39;s - top round, bottom flat. Then try using
    that curve to form the r &#40;flat on bottom, curved on top&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    all those nice little slits are going to close up at small size. You&#39;re probably
    better off just closing them up. Your letterforms will be unique enough without
    it. &#40;if you choose to try this, you can still do the curve suggestion above,
    just overlap a tiny bit.&#41; <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: Thanks alot of the suggestions guys. <BR>I can see how all these important
    issues with my logo that you guys are bringing up goes right back to my typography
    class i&#39;m in right now.. <BR> <BR>Daniel - Good point, I was actually trying
    that because the typeface was orginally like that.. but then i realised that using
    that would not only look bad, but wouldn&#39;t represent my ideas for the design.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant - I understand what Randy is saying, that at a small size it isnt
    really noticible. Maybe I&#39;ve just been looking at it too long, but doesnt
    it seem akward joined? The rest of the letters have this rythmic space inbetween
    them and then one large glyph without a space looks weird. I guess if I join them
    all together it woudnt look bad. <BR> <BR> <BR>Tiffany - Thanks for your suggestion.
    Do you think flipping it would create the same problem in my first designs.. that
    it would look like two tottaly differnt characters.. an &#39;f&#39; and a &#39;t&#39;?
    <BR> <BR>Randy.. good point, I didnt think about the size thing with the gaps.
    But the &#39;R&#39; .. your right on the money. I didn&#39;t even consider that.
    I mean, I know that it looked off, but I wasnt sure why. Making it more similar
    to the counter space of the &#39;E&#39; has made the design more cohesive I feel.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to figure out what else I could do to this. Perhaps back
    to the drawing board. This forum is a great tool and is helping me learn alot
    about typography and design in general.. I just don&#39;t want it to seem like
    I&#39;m coming here for someone to hold my hand and make the design for me, you
    know? Albeit, these suggestions are very helpful and have definately improved
    the design. I guess, as long as I understand why it makes the design more effective.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again everyone <BR> <BR>Drew <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/20014.gif"

  body: 'Of this batch, bottom is best. <BR> <BR>Ok, looking at the 2 t&#39;s: <BR>The
    spacing is bad. Check the space between et vs. te vs. tt, they should visually
    the same, and all should be tighter to jive with the le and er spacing. <BR> <BR>The
    x-height seems too close to the ascender height. Seems like you have 2 choices:
    1&#41; raise up the L and the TT, and 2&#41; lower them both to x-height, ok and
    3&#41; raise the L, but lower the TT. &#40;maybe best?&#41; <BR> <BR>Hard to tell
    from the gif, but double check to make sure the L isn&#39;t below the baseline.
