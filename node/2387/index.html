Too many people focus on the seemingly obvious alignments when there are far more important alignments to be watched.

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Jon, my remark was a big generalization, but from my point of view its often true.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The new breed designer that gets hired in-house for minimum wage is given a computer for &quot;tools&quot; and a copy of photoshop for dummies. Often enough they get reshuffled from the communications dept once some manager discovers that John Doe created that smashing powerpoint with rotating globes.
