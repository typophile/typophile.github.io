body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m searching for resources on designing typefaces for screen
  (books, websites, blog posts, etc.). I\u2019ve looked here and there and didn\u2019t
  find anything so I wondered if someone here could be of some help. This question
  is curiosity-driven since I\u2019m not working on such a project, this is why I
  wanted to focus on the design part of the issue. I know of course that hinting comes
  into play for the rendering process on screen and that every screen and situation
  (based on software, etc.) is different, but this not a technical question (and that\u2019s
  why I\u2019ve put it in the Design section). I\u2019m talking about the forms of
  the letters. What are the design principles for type design for screen? For instance,
  if I take a look at Px Grotesk by Optimo (http://www.optimo.ch/typefaces_Px-Grotesk.html),
  I can deduce that it is grid based and that there is a strong emphasis on the squareness
  of the stems to match the pixels. This is the kind of information I\u2019m looking
  for. I can look around and compare typefaces of course but I wanted to know if there
  was some kind of exhaustive resource like there is <em>Size-specific adjustments
  to type designs</em> for the subject of designing for specific sizes.\r\n\r\nI hope
  I was clear enough and thanks in advance."

    I wanted to specify that it\u2019s not a technical questions since I\u2019m not
    looking for anything related to the font technology such as hinting, font formats,
    etc. My question revolves around the visual aspect of type design. I wonder if
    there are particular forms deriving from the context of screen display, some design
    \u201Ctricks\u201D inspired by technical constraints such as inktraps (different
    context of course) or rules in the letter proportions, etc."

  body: "Dear Emmanuel, \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think PX Grotesk is a very relevant example.
    I like it very much. However, it is not <em>drawn for,</em> but <em>inspired by,</em>
    the \xE6sthetics of lowres. I would rather look into Font Bureau\u2019s RE series,
    or other initiatives like H&FJ\u2019s ScreenSmart fonts,  Typotheque\u2019s Screen
    fonts, Letter From Sweden\u2019s Core fonts or our (Monokrom\u2019s) Screen series
    (admittedly not much of a series, yet). You can read a little bit about <a href=\"https://monokrom.no/fonts/aften/design\">my
    process with Aften Screen here</a>.\r\n\r\nI went far with Aften Screen, and perhaps
    I will tone it down in the future when medium resolution screens are more common,
    but there are still lessons to be learned. With anti-aliasing, letters start to
    behave very much like they do in small sizes on paper. When blurry edges overlap
    and multiply, you end up with a fuzzy image. One can counteract this by moving
    things further apart: enlarging the x-height, drawing wider shapes, increasing
    the spacing, simplifiying shapes, opening the apertures, \u201Ctrapping\u201D
    the corners &c. The ideal weight of a text cut differs from browser to browser
    and system to system, but better results can generally be achieved with a slightly
    lighter weight than the ideal print weight. You\u2019ll want to focus mainly on
    simplifying things that cause fuzz in the y-direction. The computer doesn\u2019t
    have eyes \u2013 it sees only coordinates. If some vertical alignment differ only
    by a few units across your styles, it is bound to be rounded differently by different
    browsers and different systems at different sizes. David Berlow preaches a different,
    but related, idea (and I\u2019m not indifferent, just focus slightly differently):
    quantification (which is a variant of the same thing I\u2019m talking about \u2013
    only he seems more interested in the x-direction). \r\n\r\nAnother thing, that
    is not directly design related, but crucial to contemporary web fonts: keep the
    points as few as possible, keep your hinting effective, and use components whenever
    possible \u2013 in short, keep the file size as tiny as possible."

  body: "It's a good question. \r\n\r\nI mostly agree with Mike and Frode,  though
    \"quantification (which is a variant of the same thing I\u2019m talking about
    \u2013 only he seems more interested in the x-direction\", is not quite all right.
    I quantize quantifiably.;) \r\n\r\nMy interest in x is no more than Latin's greater
    complexity there. I think Latin glyphs exhibit uniqueness in their combinations
    of x and y things. But in y there are a few alignments, their over/undershoots,
    and waistbands, while in x, each letter has something unique.\r\n\r\nIt's slightly
    more comforting a design process than normal though, as the way a normal font
    may be used off-screen, it's nearly impossible to test everything that may be
    done with it, while designing for, e.g. small size use, only on the web, the designer
    is much more free to really look at, and address everything likely to happen in
    recommended use, for a change. ;)\r\n\r\n"
