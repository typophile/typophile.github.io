  beauty ..is it related to caslon in any way?\r\nI found it during a project research
  at the local library.  \r\nI think this is brilliant typesetting, and I just love
  how the \"v\" interacts with the \"a\"\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/observateur_3717.JPG]"

    Graphique</a> is quite similar."

  body: "Yes it seems very similar.\r\nBut I guess it must be an altered version or
    a custom job then. It works really well with the tilted \"e\" and I love the round
    bottom of the \"b\". It also seem more condensed.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link anyway"
