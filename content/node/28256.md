body: I have been given the task to design a logo for a clothing company that will
  manufacture skirts (for women obviously). It's not supposed to be extremly upper
  class, neither very hippy style. For the avarage young modern woman I suppose. This
  is what I have been working on. Any feedback here would be very welcome. Does the
  design suck? Is it good?

  body: "I think its very nice, is the script an adapted existing typeface? \r\n\r\nThe
    \"since 2006\" troubles me a little, maybe it has too much character and fights
    with the oppskjortet. A quieter alternative might be a geometric sans like verlag
    or futura or something?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thank you for your feedback. The script is Poodle Pusher from Nick's Fonts,
    somewhat modified. You may be right about the "since 2006". I will try Gotham
    or Futura instead. Or maybe a SC Freight?

  body: "Hi there!\r\n\r\nNice work! I think it looks appealing - I'm not 100% sure
    about the 'Since 2006' typeface - I'd be tempted to try a less organic-looking
    font (it looks a bit like a celtic type style). It was only on the second viewing
    that I saw the needle - I like the idea, but I think you're trying too hard to
    make the acsender of the k like an eye of a needle, and it looks a bit awkward.
    Why not try to make it flow more and not be 100% like an needle eye as you don't
    get a counter anyway in the letter k, so it would be noticeable and might well
    encourage someone to asscoiate the meaning with it). Leave the eye in - the logo
    doesn't depend on someone 'getting it' to read it - but it's a cute touch if they
    read that meaning into it.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see it at a small size also - the
    eye of the needle might fill in when it goes small."

    a few days so I can see it again with fresh, and not tired, eyes. Here is a small
    version also.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oppskjortet_small_6017.jpg]

  body: "Try to put the 'SINCE 2006' under the lettering 'Oppskj\xF8rtet', next to
    the j's tail, about two or even three times bigger. It will be much more readable
    (and hence more fit for embroidery at small sizes)."

  body: "I think you need to add a bit more weight to the s j and o; and increase
    the space between r and t, I read \u2026odet. I am not sure that the pin is as
    successful as the needle, might need to be thicker or maybe even dropped to keep
    the image play to a minimum. The cross of the \xF8 looks a bit too symmetrical.\r\nHowever,
    I am not sure that it is appealing to the modern young woman and it might be something
    as simple as pallette or slightly rotating it.\r\nTim"

  body: "I really like it! \r\nOne concern: the \"r\" seems a bit heavy and too close
    to the following \"t\", almost suggesting a \"d\".\r\nA subtle adjustment: I would
    recommend thinning the bottom curve of the \"r\", and moving the vertical stroke
    of that \"t\" a little to the right.\r\nAlso, you might consider tweaking the
    two \"p\"s so that they are not identical -- after all, it's supposed to look
    hand done, not mechanical.\r\n\r\nIs it too retro for today's young woman -- grandma's
    brand?\r\nIt's hard to say. Kids rock those styles, which is annoying. When I
    dress like my dad, I look like an old geezer--when my son does it, he looks hip.\r\nSo,
    it might be a good idea to present your client with some alternatives, and have
    them tested by a focus group.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think you need to think about how its ultimately going to be used. Will
    it be stiched into the skirt? Will it be on a label on the skirt and how big will
    it be used. I will guess unless its very large your Since 2006 will be lost. I
    would suggest getting more information then you can focus your design based on
    end use.

  body: "\"since 2006\"?\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of that?\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm wrong,
    but I always thought what little value there was in 'since...' or 'founded...'
    tag-lines was to indicate some long-term health of the company.\r\n\r\nMaybe hold
    off 25 years or so before adding that. ;o)\r\n\r\nThe logotype, though...wonderful!"

  body: "There is a little inconsistency between the line weight of where the interior
    swash meets the right side of the \"O\" and where it emerges. It might be an optical
    illusion, but line seems to dramatically narrow as it \"passes through\" the O.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the curve of the swash on the interior of the O doesn't match the angle that it
    emerges from the O and travels up to the K. The curve on the interior looks like
    it produce an exterior swash curving lower, more toward the tops of the Ps. Right
    now it looks too stiff as it emerges from the O--the swash needs to feel as fluid
    as it does on the interior of the O."

  body: Does your client manufacture skirts for other labels or will this be the final
    logo that will be used on the skirts? I know a fews things about the apparel industry
    and it's looked down upon to actually involve tools like sewing machines, needle
    and thread in a fashion logo. This would work better for a seamstress that manufactured
    clothing for other labels.

  body: "I'd recommend a slight alteration to one of the p's so they're each unique...\r\n\r\nAs
    long as it is reproduces faithfully (silkscreened/printed and not embroidered/stitched
    as others have cautioned), I think this is fantastic. I'm a sucker for visual
    puns/hidden elements.\r\n\r\nOne other random thought... what are your thoughts
    about the color palette? Maybe a second color (for the thread and the pin) would
    add some spice? (On the other hand, maybe it would make the puns too obvious.)

  body: "I think your logo is great, but I'm quite sure it wouldn't work for modern
    young women in the market where I currently work (south-eastern Brazil). Since
    I don't know anything about the \"average young modern woman\" in your market
    (Scandinavia?), I would strongly suggest that you try this logo on a focus group.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you'll find out that you're in perfect tune with average modern young women in
    your corner of the world, maybe you'll come to the conclusion that their taste
    sucks, or that they don't get and/or don't interpret your logo the way you would
    like them to. Problem is, you can't change the target audience (well, at least
    not without spending several million dollars on a massive campaign); you must
    adapt to it.\r\n\r\nGet your focus group to rate your logo on several different
    criteria, using a scale from 1 to 5. For instance:\r\n\r\n(a) This logo suggests
    products that are:\r\n1 (old-fashioned) ... 2 ... 3 (neutral) ... 4 ... 5 (modern)\r\n\r\n(b)
    You're most likely to associate this logo with:\r\n1 (techno music) ... 2 ...
    3 (rock'n'roll) ... 4 ... 5 (classical music)\r\n\r\n(c) A product bearing this
    logo is likely to be:\r\n1 (horribly expensive) ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 (dirt
    cheap)\r\n\r\nAnd so on. Example (b) might be silly, but questions along these
    lines can be helpful, since people normally associate things in intricate ways.
    And anyway, you may want to know whether a girl would feel comfortable wearing
    an Oppskj\xF8rtet skirt to a hip nightclub.\r\n\r\nMake sure your scale isn't
    always 1=low/bad, 5=high/good, or people may become biased towards one end of
    the scale."
