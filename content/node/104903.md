    There's also [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/the-foundry-typefaces/sans/params/foundry-gridnik|Gridnik]]
    but 250\xA3...\r\nSome more, may be more affordable: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scannerlicker/gerusa|Gerusa]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/scriber|Scriber]], [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontsmith/fs_sinclair_family_ot|Sinclair]]\r\nHard
    to say for the family... I've actually sorted mine under \"(like) blender\" name...
    Gerusa and Scriber are both tagged as \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aoctagonal|octogonal]]\".
    May be octogonal sans would be fine..."
