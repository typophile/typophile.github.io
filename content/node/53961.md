  atypical topic from NLT 1861 (via StrangeMaps blog, article at http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/353-kanawha-and-a-landlocked-virginia/).
  \ \r\n\r\nCan anyone kindly ID them:\r\n\r\n1.  Existing state names (OHIO)\r\n2.
  \ Proposed new state names and bodies of water (KANAWHA)\r\n3.  Non-capital cities
  (Pittsburgh)\r\n\r\nRivers, capital cities, and physical features appear to be obliques
  of the above three.  There are a couple of other minor entries for scale, caption,
  and copyright that I'm less interested in.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kanawhamap_3593.jpg]"

    thick and thin stroked alphabet is hand drawn. I think the state names are too.
    There is a lot of other more obviouse hand drawn lettering there but some of those
    city names do look like type. If so, how could type be incorporated into a drawing
    from this age?"
