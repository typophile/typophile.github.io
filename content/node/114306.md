  body: "Found a match called Arroyo but as I can't state about its legitimacy, I
    prefer not linking to it. It is actually very close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/anzeigen|Anzeigen]],
    main difference being on /R leg.\r\nMore in same ballpark: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/header|Header]],

  body: "Hi Ryuk, perfect find for the yellow letters. Note the red letters are stretched
    vertically so the VIKI ANDERSON is not overpowered by the yellow letters. A clear
    example of photo morphing of the font. The digital Arroyo is fairly well made.
    But has no designer or copyright info other than a reference to fontmonger. Would
    be interesting to find out who did it. BTW note the ampersand. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArroyoAmpersand_6059.jpg]\r\nOnly
    a few fonts use this version.\r\nDon"

  body: "As for the narrower bottom row, Wagner Grotesk http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/wagner-grotesk/
    is as good a match for this one as Anzeigen is for the yellow lettering. In both
    cases the R has the wrong leg. Wagner Grotesk has an ampersand that is similar
    to Arroyo except it lacks a opening between the bar and the lhs.\r\nDon"
