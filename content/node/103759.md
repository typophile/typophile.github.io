body: "Hello there ladies and gentlemen. I'm in an odd situation and would like some
  advice. \r\n\r\nI am about to graduate from Loughborough University with a degree
  in Graphic Communication. In my final year I developed a love of typography and
  would like to follow this as a career. I created a font in Fontforge, which you
  can find on DaFont (search for Tomb if you're interested and it's called Tomb2013).
  However,  I am not actually sure how to pursue a career in this field! It's the
  creation of working fonts that interests me most, rather than the kind that is typically
  more decorative that you might find on banners and posters. I'm more into the legible,
  workable, downloadable and easy to read fonts that use simplicity to portray emotion
  and a story etc. I hope you understand what I mean. \r\n\r\nI'm just totally lost
  as to how to start my career. Do I need to stay freelance? And if so, who on earth
  needs this kind of work doing? As far as I'm aware, most places just opt for a standard
  font that already exists. Is this completely wrong?\r\n\r\nAny help would be fabulous.
  I live in England in Northamptonshire, so if you know of any places around there
  (or anywhere in the UK, really) that you think would be good to contact then please
  let me know! I'm also unsure as to how my typography work will be received by a
  standard design agency (i.e. if they want an artworker). Although I'm capable of
  doing this, my portfolio is geared towards typography. Any tips? \r\n\r\nSorry this
  is such a beastly long post :) Can you tell I'm confused/worried? Cheers! "

    typography) I would recommend getting in touch with the [[http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/|Department
    of Typography and Graphic Communication at the University of Reading]]. Even if
    you are not likely to undertake post-graduate work at the moment they offer a
    [[http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/Shortcourses/typ-shortcoursesTDi.aspx|summer
    programme]] which might be perfect to give you the kind of focus you are looking
    for.\r\n\r\nThere is a requirement for freelancers in this field but it is already
    populated by a large number of well established designers (many post here). That
    is not to say that you shouldn't put yourself out there in that respect but it
    may take some time to establish yourself. You could also do a lot worse than reaching
    out to UK based foundries and seeing if they will take you on as an intern. When
    jobs in the type industry do come up they are often posted here and on [[http://typedrawers.com/|TypeDrawers]]
    and it is not uncommon for people to request work on this site (http://typophile.com/node/103704).\r\n\r\nI
    hope that helps..."

  body: "Hi Karl, \r\n\r\nThanks for your speedy response! Very helpful. I'll get
    in touch with Reading. I've already explored their typography department on an
    open day :)  I had no idea that they ran these 5-10 day courses though! Other
    than that, I guess it's a case of unashamed self-promotion for my future then.
    I'll just keep trying and hope for the best. Thanks again."

    to do full-time (although it depends entirely on how you like to -and can- live).
    At least to start, you might make it only part of your income stream.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      leaving me with just perseverance and dedication. I guess I''ll have to re-think
      my whole career. Not sure why lecturers never say anything like "Just so you
      know, that''s a tough gig". That would have helped before I spent my final year
      focusing on typography. Eek! '

  body: "What Hrant said as well. It is worth bearing in mind that fonts have applications
    in numerous industries and that pure type design does not need to be the only
    path. Understanding and working with complimentary technologies and professions
    (typesetting, editorial design, web design, rendering environments, communication
    design) will often lead you back to working with fonts.\r\n\r\nIf it makes you
    feel any better (it probably will not) I have a degree in literature and did not
    start working with fonts until my late twenties. Having this focus now and sticking
    with it should definitely lead you somewhere interesting!"

  body: "Hi Lucy!\r\n\r\nGlad to see you using FontForge! :) Are you using GNU+Linux,
    Mac OS X, or Windows?\r\n\r\nThe FontForge community has put together www.designwithfontforge.com
    which is intended as a 'beginners guide' to both FontForge's UI and typeface design.
    There's also www.oert.org, an open educational resource on type and typography.
    \r\n\r\nThe type review boards on here and TypeDrawers are an amazing resource,
    and I suggest posting your work in progress there to get feedback. \r\n\r\nI also
    help put on type design workshops around the world - www.craftingtype.com - and
    we're expecting do something in Spain this summer and something in London in September/October.
    You can follow @craftingtype or join the mailing list to get an update, or just
    keep an eye on the site. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDave"
