body: "I'm finishing up my font Insider and a friend of mine is test-driving it. The
  font seems to work just fine in FontExplorer, but doesn't work well in InDesign
  CS3 (5.01) and Illustrator CS3 (13.02). All fonts are suitcases for Mac.\r\n\r\nIt
  keeps giving out this error:\r\n\"You might not be able to print with \"fontname\"
  or stroke its characters because the font outline file is missing.\"\r\n\r\nThat
  the hell does that mean? I never get that error here. I don't have InDesign CS3,
  so I can't reproduce the problem. Is there anyone else that get's the same errors
  and knows how to solve this?"

  body: 'If you generated a Type 1 font for Mac, there will be two files: The font
    suitcase ("FFIL" on the icon) and an outline font file ("LWFN" on the icon). The
    error indicates that only the suitcase file was installed.'

  body: "Normally I double click the FFIL file and the font is installed in Fontbook.
    I don't know how FontExplorer works, but my guess is that it works the same. How
    else should you install both files? \r\nIf you check the destination folder for
    the fonts, both files are in there.\r\nIs there another problem that might initiate
    this error?"

  body: "The sure fire way is to go to your home folder, then go to Library > Fonts.
    Drag both files to the Fonts folder. This is essentially what Font Book does when
    you tell it to install a FFIL file you double-clicked on. I knows about the companion
    LWFN file automatically. FontExplorer's default behavior is to make a copy of
    the files in its private database, but you have to drag both files to it, not
    just the FFIL. \r\n\r\nGenerally, when I'm testing fonts, I don't use a font management
    tool. I copy files manually to either my user Fonts folder or the Adobe Fonts
    folder ([main hard drive]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/). "

  body: "Ok, quick reply. Both font files are in the right place. FontExplorer seems
    to have an own ordner per font, so there must be another problem at work. \r\nCan
    the LWFN file be corrupt? Can it be that, when generating the font, the outlines
    are not put out? \r\n\r\nStrange..."

  body: I've never heard of an LWFN file being corrupt, but I suppose it's possible.
    In the pre-OS X days it was common for FFIL (suitcase) files to become corrupt
    because they were always open for read/write access when they were active.
