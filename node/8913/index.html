		<div class="commentbody">Em is a unit to measure type. It is not really related to the letter &quot;M&quot; in any manner.  <BR> <BR>In digital type design, em is the size of the em square. The emsquare is a hypothetical square that your type design relates to. The always corresponds to the point type size in the design application. This means, whenever you set 10 point type, it will be the em that actually will be 10 points. In a digital font, the em is divided into units &ndash; typically 1000 units per em. If you set 10 point type, the 1000 units will correspond to 10 point. If your caps are 700 units high, this means that in 10 point type, the caps will be 7 point high. If your descenders are 200 units, they will be 2 point long in 10 point type (and 3 units in 15 point type, obviously).  <BR> <BR>An en space should be 1/2 em, i.e. (typically) 500 units wide.  <BR> <BR>It is advisable that the distance between the ascender line and the descender line in your font equals the em size, i.e. typically 1000 units. For example, if your ascender is 750 units, the descender should be 250 units. By doing so, the user will have better chances to accurately measure the type size of printed text set in your font.  <BR> <BR>Adam</div>

If the &quot;mark&quot; feature is not included in the font, a layout engine such as that in Microsoft Word XP (or Publisher XP, for that matter), the accents will be centered.

I usually put them on the width of the lowercase o, positioned so that they would be in correct relationship to the o if superimposed. Then I can make the combining versions as composites and simply shift the left sidebearing onto the right sidebearing.

		<div class="commentbody">Not to break an interesting discussion, but in passing, could you talk about how would one handle the scansion marks *ictus* (a sort of large *acute*) or the *longum* (a sort of *macron*)? With scansion marks, the mark is usually positioned in the middle of the syllable, so the longum and breve are much wider than the diacritics which go over a single letter. &ndash; when we had to set a scansion breve, I'd use one of the phonetic symbols &ndash; a tie, I believe &ndash;then draw up a macron to match it. In classical prosody, you use the longum &amp; breve with Greek &amp; Latin; the ictus only is used in English. But as with most things, modern writers on prosody have adopted more symbols to show more things, so the ictus &amp; &quot;reverse ictus&quot; (*grave*) are now used with the longum &amp; breve. <BR> <BR>This becomes more of an issue as the *file* rather than the printed book becomes the end product of publishing. <BR> <BR>C</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Charles, the syllable-level scansion marks seem to be similar to the challenges of Hebrew masoretic mark positioning. This is a circle above the text that is properly placed as close as possible to the centre of a word (taking into account that there may be other above-letter marks that will displace it slightly). Unicode has no mechanism for encoding marks relative to words, and smart font formats like OpenType have no mechanism for positioning marks relative to words. In both Unicode and OpenType, a combining mark belongs to the immediately preceding base character. So this means that a manual mechanism is required to allow the user to encode and position the masoretic mark as close as possible to the desired position. In effect, this means that the mark has to be positioned either above a base character or between two base characters. A greater level of refinement than that it difficult to obtain without user-controlled adjustment of mark positioning (such as provided in the Middle East version of InDesign). <BR> <BR>This is the mechanism I worked out for the Hebrew masoretic mark, which perhaps will help you with your scansion marks. <BR> <BR>The mark is centered on a zero width (this is actually common for Hebrew marks, due to the method of mark positioning used by some older Hebrew layout engines, and so differs from the typical left-offset of Latin marks or right-offset of Arabic marks). This means that when the mark is not positioned relative to a base using GPOS mark positioning, it will naturally rest between two base characters (blind positioning). GPOS anchor attachment information is provided to position the mark above a preceding base character. This anchor attachment positioning becomes the default positioning. This positioning can then be inhibited by insertion of the zero-width non-joiner character between the preceding base and the mark, restoring the blind positioning between the two base characters. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/64086.gif" alt="Masoretic mark positioning"> <BR>[By the way, I'm familiar with the term ictus in a different context: in Gregorian chant notation, it is the small vertical line below a note (or in some note arrangements above) indicating the first beat of the rhythm in that part of the melody.]</div>
