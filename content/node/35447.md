body: "It\u2019s kind of a black letter but joined together. I got the inspiration
  from seeing some badly set text. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s at a really early stage. I'm
  just a little unsure about the whole thing. Sometimes I like it; sometimes I think
  it just isn't going to work. \r\n\r\nThe fully finished version is going to use
  a lot of contextual alternates to get around some of the problems. It\u2019s just
  the general construction of it I need help on and some good advice from people more
  experienced than me."

  body: "overall, it's super klutzy in a way that's really interesting.\r\n\r\nit
    kind of reminds me of the fake blackletter the nazi party commissioned for WW2
    communications in germany. you might research that period if you're looking for
    more shapes. there's a lot of examples in a biography of renner written by christopher
    burke and published by princeton architectural press."

  body: "I like this a lot.  I imagine this font on a vintage tourist brochure from
    the early 1960s for a Bavarian castle. \r\n\r\nI think it would look a lot better
    if you made the letters more consistent:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>the i is too short
    -- the dot should be above the x-height, like in the j</li>\r\n <li>the spacing
    between dot and main letter stroke should be the same in the i and j.</li>\r\n
    <li>The descenders of the y and the g look like streched versions of each other;
    they should either be identical or be very different.</li>\r\n <li>The widths
    of the bowls of the m are different, they should be the same.</li>\r\n <li>Either
    the w is too narrow or the m is too wide -- they should have similar widths. </li>\r\n
    <li>The heights of the verticals in the w should be consistent; or at least the
    first and the last should. </li>\r\n <li>The x seems to stand out a bit; I would
    maybe pull ideas from the k for the x.</li>\r\n <li>The z is too tall.</li>\r\n</ul>"
