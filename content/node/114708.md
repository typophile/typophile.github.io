    start with reworking serifs of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/engravers|Engravers]]
    mainly because of proportion and bowler size.\r\nOther alternative: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/craw+modern|Craw

  body: "Hi Ryuk, here are the results of applying your idea to Craw Modern bold in
    two steps. First, rounding of serifs and other stroke connections to match OBAN:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CrawModernBoldModified1_5510.jpg]\r\nSecond,
    thickening of letters by using the parallel lines method:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CrawModernBoldModified2_5532.jpg]\r\nPretty
    close.\r\nDon"
