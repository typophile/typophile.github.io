  or Fontlab Studio.\r\n\r\nMy first question is if I upgrade from Typetool to Fontographer
  later then would that mean I have to give up my license for Typetool and no longer
  be able to use it?\r\n\r\nSecondly, I currently use Windows and am thinking of moving
  to a Mac in the near future. In that case would I have to buy the Mac versions again?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJason "

    program.\r\n\r\nTwo: If you've already upgraded to FOG or FL, yes. Check with
    FontLab to see if you can upgrade cross-platform."

  body: Thanks for the info Nick, so an exchange from PC to Mac isn't possible then?
    I'll ask Fontlab about the cross-platform upgrade.

    so I'll see what they say regarding an exchange between platforms.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I think the forum over here is more active then over there so if anyone from Fontlab
    sees this post then it'll be much appreciated if you could answer my queries."

    to send an email to FontLab and get an answer.

    the same question to Fontlab,\r\n\r\n\"You would lose your license to Typetool
    if you are not an owner of the software.\r\nIt is possible to change from one
    platform to another within a certain amount of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n-Jason"

    I think he meant to say that if you sold it or something?? But that wasn't even
    part of the question. \r\n\r\nI think somebody else might be able to clarify this."
