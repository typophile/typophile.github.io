body: I have a client that strikes through their previous price in their ad, then
  shows a new, lower price next to it.  <BR> <BR>Can anyone suggest a font that has
  a line through it? It is not an option to ad the strike in layout.

  body: Laura, if there is a specific font you would like to  use, don&#39;t let the
    lack of a strikethrough option hinder you. <BR> <BR>If you have an image editor,
    such as Photoshop, Illustrator, or even MSPaint, you can type the words you need
    in the font you want, and then add lines through it as needed with a Line tool,
    and usually Photoshop or Illustrator has some neat looking line options to really
    make it look as though it were crossed out with a marker, for example.  Hope this
    helps!

  body: Thank you Ryan, but unfortunately, I MUST have a Type 1 Postscript font.  I
    create templates for an automated print system.  A pre-defined layout is created
    in XML, and the fonts must be pre-defined with it.  Then, as content is changed,
    the whole thing is sent to the printer for printing.  Thus, I must have a font,
    and not just an image. <BR> <BR>I am currently looking into Fontographer or something
    like it, because I&#39;ve had no luck finding a strikethrough font.
