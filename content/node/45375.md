  by... is it simply licencing, is one better than the other, one more meticulous
  than the other?\r\n\r\nITC Lubalin Graph by Elsner+Flake (on FontShop)\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/itc_lubalin_graph_bold/\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nITC
  Lubalin Graph (on Monotype)\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=425731&gclid=CLeZw-6wqJMCFR0ZagodZhYAoA\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: IIRC Elsner+Flake own different data than that owned by Monotype so there
    will be subtle differences. I know Monotype seems to have more of the ligatures
    for Avant Garde than those of Elsner+Flake.
