  glyphs so they come out that way when typed? Do programs even support that? I'm
  not doing anything professional with it, just for interest sake.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think there was an encoding for that once by Adobe but no applications
    support it anymore. So - no. There is also a thing called Phototype that is coming
    which has color bitmaps. \r\n\r\nYou might be able to build a 'macro' or script
    that auto-switches the font settings including color for you though. I would go
    that route if you really want this."

  body: "One of my students asked me that once. The short answer is No. The long answer
    is that you can embed information within the glyphs of a font (most easily within
    their width metrics) that can used by a script in an app to assign colors to the
    glyphs. Maybe.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I hand draw a lot of alphabets with colours in them, and I'm basically looking
    for a way to type them without having to hand set every single letter.\r\n\r\nComputers
    have let me down *gasp*\r\n\r\nI'm going to look into the colour metrics. I want
    to make a font that can only be pink."

    is not necessarily possible, and if it\r\nis it would require some (light) programming.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    pink font in then?"
