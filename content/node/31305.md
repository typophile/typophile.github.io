  two weights of Avenir. It's for a logistics company doing import/export. In addition
  to Avenir, I'm considering recommending a secondary text type option (serifed) for
  corporate communications. Or to keep things simple, should I stay within the Avenir
  family throughout? \r\n\r\nAny suggestions or thoughts?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAndrew"
