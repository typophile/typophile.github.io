body: "an eclectic typeface i designed while experimenting for my final major project.
  Designed with children's beads.soon to be printed on A1 paper and displayed at my
  colleges end of year show\r\n\r\nalso i'm contemplating printing a few up to sell/send
  to people for promotional purposes though if you hang around i will more than likely
  be designing a Complete poster with illustration etc\r\n\r\nalso this is purely
  for display purposes only,i have never used fontlab or any font making software
  and don't think i'm about to,i'm just happy making typefaces that can be used as
  headers or such like\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasbird/2430990587/\r\n\r\npsview
  all sizes to get a better view of the typeface\r\n\r\ncrit more than welcome\r\n\r\nthom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Great experiment Thomas. If you turn them to EPS files maybe they might be
    worth to sell.
