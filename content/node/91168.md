  body: No, the /G/ is not right. This is one of those more recent in-between grotesques,
    but I don't know which.

  body: Actually, the slanted cuts (on r, e, etc.) in the sample look a bit less steep
    than the ones in Arial.

  body: "WhatTheFont thinks it's Arial, although Riccardo is right about the cuts.
    However it looks identical otherwise. Perhaps someone went to the trouble of customizing
    Arial a great deal for the job\r\n\r\n Arial is a pretty close fit, if you need
    to use a similar font. Helvetica or Neuzeit S would probably also do the trick.

  body: "From it's <a href=\"http://www.radimpesko.com/fonts/union\">site</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Union
    is intended for situations where Helvetica seems too sophisticated and Arial too
    vulgar, or vice versa.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo I suppose it's to be used when one
    wants something between vulgar and sophisticated."
