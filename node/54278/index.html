  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Last semester we had to design a booklet on a certain time period in graphic design history. I had three, and although my booklet was not my best work, there is one artist who&rsquo;s work I fell in love with from &ldquo;The New Conceptual Poster&rdquo; era. Gitte Kath. The texture in some of her posters makes me want to touch them: there&rsquo;s an almost tactile quality to them. Some of her posters take months to create and usually incorporate more than one medium. These posters, for example, incorporate photography and painting. I also enjoy the fact that many of her projects have the same background: she uses an old painted wall as a background when photographing objects. I just love collaged pieces!</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/small_Gitte_Kath_6579.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another designer I&rsquo;ve noticed in a few time periods, New Conceptual Poster and New Typographic Expression, is Paula Scher. Some of her most famous pieces include her work for the New York Public Theatre and &lsquo;Bring in da noise, bring in da funk&rsquo; posters. My favorite of hers though, is her poster for the &ldquo;Diva is Dismissed&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s kind of simple, but extremely accurate in portraying the idea of the show. And I love the expression on the woman&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>The other piece that caught my eye is from the more Recent British Graphic Design. At first, all I saw were stamps, but then on the page previous, I saw the image of the back side of a mannequin and seemingly random blue brushstrokes. I love the contrast between them. Much of the time period involved combining new media and new design studios with new approaches to &lsquo;visual problem solving&rsquo;. (I&rsquo;m not sure who the author is or even what the title is right now, but I&rsquo;ll find out and post it tomorrow!)</p>
