  of our times\"</a>, which makes some major misstatements. Perhaps there is no byline
  for a reason?\r\n\r\n<em>\"In 1956, the Haas Type Foundry commissioned Max Meidinger
  to redesign Akzidenz-Grotesk, to make it more legible to modern applications. The
  result was Haas Neue Grotesk, which the foundry\u2019s owner renamed Helvetica in
  1960. This was followed shortly thereafter by Meidinger\u2019s Univers. Helvetica
  went on to become the most in-demand font for near 20 years.\"</em>\r\n\r\nOops.
  Spiekermann's letter to the editor:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>The man was called Miedinger;
  he may only have been a foreigner, but we also like our names spelled properly</li>\r\n<li>Neue
  Haas Grotesk was a redesign of (surprise!) Haas Grotesk, which in turn was partly
  based on Scheltersche Grotesk from Schelter & Giesecke -- in those days, type was
  also quickly assimilated, copied, emulated, ripped-off; the success of Akzidenz
  Grotesk had alerted Haas to the fact that they were missing sales because all the
  Swiss designers were specifying AG from Germany.</li>\r\n<li>The name Helvetica
  was coined by a salesman -- Heinz Eul -- at D. Stempel AG, a foundry in Frankfurt
  who didn't want to market a typeface with a name like Neue Haasche Grotesk. Credit
  for the invention of the name later went to Eul's boss, Schultz-Anker, the MD of
  Stempel (in case you wondered: i have the original correspondence about the name)</li>\r\n<li>Univers
  was designed in 1957 by Adrian Frutiger, while working for Deberny & Peignot in
  Paris.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nI post this not just to poke a bit of fun, but because the
  details of typographic history are known to so few, it's important that a major
  design publication gets them right, or they can quickly get lost. <em>Computer Arts</em>
  quoted me later in the article, but failed to get the name of my blog right."

    special issue.\r\n\r\nI have to agree that the Type of Our Times was a bit wack,
    but it wasn't the Helvetica details that bothered me, but the Modernist perspective.
    The history of type culture is not Bauhaus, Dada, Constructivists, etc. But this
    fault is widespread in design history, exemplified in Phillip Meggs <em>History.</em>\r\n\r\nFor
    an English perspective, it's like you're travelling through vast pre-war suburban
    estates of mock-Tudor semi-detached homes, to get to a 1930s international style
    mansion at the end of a lane."

    have another good article about Erik himself!. The wholw magazine is about typography,
    so it is not to be missed by most of the people around here. I myself was asked
    to make a tutorial... how to create a classic typeface.\r\n\r\nI think the general
    problem with being misquoted etc, is because of the tight deadlines. They don't
    have the time or staff to read through the the copy enough before printing."

    do seem to trip themselves up a bit sometimes. The \"Summer 2006\" issue (#126)
    had a nice marquetry effect cover design (teamed with a Photoshop tutorial inside),
    but touted it as \"woodcut effects\"... er, no.  Oddly, the same month's issue
    of Creative Review does actually have a woodcut on the cover.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nEver

    comprehensive history of graphic design. \r\nIn focusing on the modernist thread,
    he reflected a general consensus, and also set the tone.\r\n\r\nLewis Blackwell's
    20th Century Type is similar, but it's like two separate histories in one. On
    the one hand it shows a history of avant garde examples of modernist typography,
    but on the other, it dutifully shows the major type designs, many of which are
    historicist, as alphabetic specimens -- but few are shown in use."
