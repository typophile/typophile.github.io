body: "I received the CD on Helvetica and was surprised that there were a few inaccuracies
  in the story of the development of the Helvetica family. There wasn't any information
  about the first release of the Helvetica family which contained some of the Anzeigen
  Grotesk fonts and the competition of families such as Folio. When I worked with
  Saul Bass he preferred the Folio series over the first release of Helvetica. The
  official type face for the city of West Berlin was the Akzidenz Grotesk Buch  designed
  by G.G. Lange for Berthold and not Helvetica. The Neue Helvetica was shown and not
  mentioned as a remake by Linotype.\r\nHaving lived during that period of early Helvetica
  and worked with both Bauer, Berthold and Stempel I was aware of the competition
  and the maketing. The first typographer in the USA to put in the Helvetica was Spartan
  Typographers in Oakland, California and the fame of Helvetica from there. If you
  run across the original showing can see a hodge podge of fonts.\r\n\r\nI LIKED THE
  FILM"

    the correct information... Have you shared this in any other way? And, If you
    don't mind me asking, what was it like working with Mr. Bass?\r\n\r\nI also liked
    the film."

  body: "As I recall this historical stuff wasn't part of Gary's original plan for
    the film. But anyway although it's technically a documentary I think it\u2019s
    aims to be entertaining rather than historically accurate- you know, like that
    Al Gore film, or a Michael Moore movie."

  body: Having never watched an interview with any of those famous typographers, I
    really appreciated those talks, which I found greatly inspiring (and eventually
    found myself reading this board very often). I now consider myself an infected
    typophile, even though I have rather limited knowledge on the subject

  body: My friends and I recently organized a screening of the Helvetica film in our
    college. I was interesting to see the type of students that turned up. Most of
    the students came from a design background, but a few that didn't have a major
    interest in type still sat through the whole movie. Entertainment-wise it does
    have its funny moments, it also gave us visual communication students a chance
    to make a poster and promotional helvetica badges for the screening. As you do...Have

  body: "albriks\r\nI had about 2 1/2 years working for Saul Bass. He had a big staff
    of designers that submitted work to him for approval and he usually\r\npicked
    a simple solution and was a great teacher. His film work was not a financial success;
    especially with clients like Otto Preminger.  He created a whole industry for
    motion picture title design. I even acted in commercials for him. Probably the
    biggest project I worked on was the film titles for \"Mad, Mad, Mad, World\".
    There were 24 actors that had 100% billing and had to be the same size, but different
    type faces. I remember doing the credits on an Easter Sunday. He was associated
    with the famous film maker Haskell Wexler and Saul was able to direct the cinema
    photography as well as the graphics. It was a creative experience I'll never forget!\r\n\r\n"
