  body: "I think this looks like it could be done as a composite of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horatio/|Horatio
    Light]] and/or a font called [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6B.html|Harry/Hammer]]
    (samples from Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide). The only missing letter is the W,
    which could be made with two V's from either of these fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
