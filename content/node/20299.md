  I would make my first post. I am currently a student studying graphic design, and
  have a quick question regarding a specific typeface.\r\n\r\nThis semester in school,
  we worked with Simoncini Garamond for a study. I found this typeface to be very
  beautiful, and a very distinctive revival of Garamond. I've been trying to research
  its history to learn more about this typeface, but have not been able to find much
  information. I looked in one of my textbooks, The Elements of Typographic Style,
  written by Robert Bringhurst, and all he mentions about this typeface is that it
  was designed by Francesco Simoncini in 1958. Does anyone know more about this typeface?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I was just curious what your favorite revival of Garamond may be. I'm glad I have
  found a site where one can converse to other type enthusiasts!\r\n\r\nJustin Clapp"

    Adobe Garamond Premier Pro, despite it\u2019s name. Simoncini is very nice, too.
    I think there was a thread about it already but I couldn\u2019t find it."

  body: "Hi Justin,\r\nSimoncini Garamond is, as perhaps you know, based on the work
    of Jean Jannon rather than Claude Garamond. Jannon is surprisingly well-served
    by modern revivals: Storm Jannon, Lanston Garamont and Monotype Garamond are all
    excellent, and there are others too. Jannon was a great type designer, if anything
    somewhat underrated. His work seems to me the most beautiful of the Baroque period;
    full of subtle distortions, it is sophisticated rather than serene, polished rather
    than pure. \r\n\r\nClaude Garamond himself has a great reputation, and is well-served
    by Adobe Garamond Premier Pro. He apparently designed his roman working from a
    copy of <cite>De Aetna</cite>, set in the Italian Francesco Griffo's half-complete
    final roman; rather suspiciously, he consistently chose the most unusual of Griffo's
    variant forms as his model, though he also eliminated most of Griffo's structual
    quirks and reduced his serifs, leaving what seems to me a less interesting kind
    of type. I like his italics better; they are revived in Stempel Garamond."

    body: "George,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for the information! I learned about Francesco
      Griffo in a class studying the history of graphic design. There is so much more
      I want to learn though. Do you recommend any books or sources on the history
      of type design and typography?\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed \"A History of Graphic
      Design\" by Meggs. I found it quite interesting and very informative. I also
      had to read \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" for school, which was a great
      book. I'd love to find a great book focused specifically on the history of typographics
      though.\r\n\r\nJustin :)"

    <cite>still</cite> deny it's not a Garamond. The description on\r\nMyFonts is
    hysterically apologetic (well, to a type geek).\r\n\r\nJannon: I'm not impressed.

  body: 'Really? My impression is that Jannon was doing with his romans something
    like Granjon and his C17th Dutch imitators did with italics, pushing each letter
    a bit off balance in order to render the precarious overall balance of the whole
    alphabet pleasurable and readable. I agree that Simoncini Garamond has an ugly
    a, but Storm Jannon''s is much better, and his is apparently the most accurate
    revival. I''d like to find out more about Jannon - does anyone know of a really
    good reproduction or analysis? '

    on Jannon. Bringhurst discusses the Jannon/Garamond issue in some detail in Elements
    but I believe his book was written before the Storm faces came out. Storm''s Jannon
    Text Moderne is attactive and highly readable. '
