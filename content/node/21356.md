body: " In 1986, Mkele Mbembe was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from college.
  On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one
  leg raised in the air.  The elephant seemed distressed so Mbembe approached it very
  carefully. He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot, and found
  a large thorn deeply embedded in it.  As carefully and as gently as he could, Mbembe
  worked the thorn out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put
  down its foot. The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather stern look
  on its face, stared at him. For several tense moments Mbembe stood frozen, thinking
  of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned
  and walked away.  Mbembe never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. Twenty
  years later he was walking through a zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached
  the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where
  Mbembe and his son Tapu were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Mbembe
  and lifted its front foot off the ground then put it down. The elephant did that
  several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemembering
  the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.
  Mbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the
  enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. Suddenly
  the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of the man's legs and
  swung him wildly back and forth along the railing, killing him. Probably wasn't
  the same elephant.\r\n"

    thorn out of the elephant's foot and they won't get captured and sent off to some
    zoo where they will be unhappy the rest of their days. Zoos don't want damaged
