  body: Feeling like such a n00b right now. Super confused by this posting/comment
    system and can't figure out how to get rid of the pink background. I hope it's
    posting correctly! Sorry if it's not!

  body: "Agree with R. I looked through all the usual sources and couldn't find anything
    closer. The combination of smoothly flowing _S_, the spurless _G_, the parallel
    sided _C_, _G_, and _O_, and the R with a vertical leg without a bottom kick,
    knocked out all the other possible candidates that I found. This version seems
    somewhat bolder than Jean-Luc but the letter forms are indeed spot-on.\r\nDon"
