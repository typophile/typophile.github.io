  body: "How long will the text be?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking slab serif here: (depending
    on style) Cholla, Vista Slab, FF Unit Slab, Prelo Slab, Dispatch, Soho Etc.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    more refined, something like Melior would work with it's square shoulders, or
    Charter with it's crisp details?\r\n\r\nDon't have Klavika to try these out on.
    Lemmeknow what you do."

  body: Not very long. It's for an identity project. I'm thinking some "newer" serif
    might work..not sure which one though. I won't be setting oodles of text with
    it that's for sure. Just enough to act as a contrast and counterpoint to Klavika.

  body: You might want to check the Process Type website, and see if there are any
    examples there in-use. You could also contact them directly and ask, I'm sure
    they would have some good suggestions.
