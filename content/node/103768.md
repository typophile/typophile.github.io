  body: "Letterpress on the business card, so it's an old metal type design. I zoomed
    the image & suspect that it's a Clarendon bold condensed rather than a slab serif
    Egyptian. Many foundries have made Clarendon's since 1845, when Besley/Fann Street
    first published it. The version is not clear from the business card.  Other letterpress
    names for Clarendon include Besley. See digital <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/besley+clarendon/fonts/\">Besley
    Clarendon</a>. You can also use PublishingMojo's myfont's link for digital Clarendon
    bold condensed.\r\nDon"

    are produced from computer files. Ergo: any font goes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It does look a lot like Clarendon with the exception of the apostrophe. Clarendon's
    looks to go straight down whereas this one seems to go in to me. It may be close
    enough for my client though, thanks for all the input everyone!
