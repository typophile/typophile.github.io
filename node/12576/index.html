  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">My client (Robert Ayres) freelances as a stylist and makeup artist.
He also does his own photography, with focus on weddings. 
He has used the logo icon  (which I created a couple of years ago) as
Ayres Creative, 
Recently he has decided that it would be better to push his name (which as
a great reputation in the field). Business was re-named Rob Ayres (the &ldquo;creative&rdquo; was dropped).
I am revamping the old type work which was done using Lineto&rsquo;s Normetica
font (which I will continue to use in associaterd text).  I am thinking that in
fashion, simple sans serif in a light to medium weight and wide seems to works well.
I like to openness of the design, with the large counters, and alternates.
I am having issues with balancing everything, as well as choosing the best characters.
I have done several Y&rsquo;s (unicase and standard caps), target-shaped geometric O&rsquo;s
and an alternate O with has larger counter. There was alternates A&rsquo;s designed
as well. I will post my a few designs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Is the second one supposed to be centered? With the slant of the A, it&rsquo;s hard to tell. I like in the second one how the gap between the block and  ROB is closed. What does it look like when left-aligned, with the block almost as far left as it is in the first one, but with the amount of space between the block and the R from the second one?  Unless some of the letters start lining up strangely, that might be the best way to go.</p>
<p>I think the wider A and squared O match the rest of the letters better. The S looks like it could be wider. The curved Y is great, I think, and gives it extra personality. The O though looks a little small. Since it&rsquo;s not a flat top &amp; bottom, it should probably crest above/below the cap height &amp; baseline.</p>
<p>Are the grey lines part of the logo? Also, what is the dot in the block? I almost don&rsquo;t want to suggest this, but the more I look at it, the more it seems like you might be able to get away with just the letters&hellip;the block is very dark compared to everything else, and the letters are working very well by themselves.</p>
<p>But without a logo, you always feel bad about charging someone for just letters. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Grey lines are from a grid I used and not part of the design. As for the O, I realize in most cases that &ldquo;O&rdquo;&rsquo;s often more extend above and below beyond the x-height by 3-5%, and I may explore this as well. In a closely stagered formation as this is I suspect it will not work , but that is what experimentation is for. I have the files on another computer so I will upload some changes in the afternoon when I am working on that system.</div>

Second design is supposed to be centered (and aligned) in a &ldquo;regtangular&rdquo; formation and not the trapezoid as shown, but AYRES is too wide at this stage. 
Block / Icon will be printed in metallic foil, so it will look seperate from rest. 
Client paid for Logo over a year ago, it is just being re-used. Type treatment is new.
I usually charge extra for guilty feelings, but in this case there are none.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the foil printing is a nice touch-The first one with the &ldquo;fun&quot;y is the type of letter that bugs you enough to make you remember it and brings unique personality and contrast within the font. I think the logo should form a justified rectangle with the spacing between the icon and R as in the first logo. I understand that you are set on using the icon but I do have to agree with the previous post and you could(in the future) use just the type and maybee print foil just for the y or a die cut&hellip;I just like the y&hellip;it&rsquo;s a logo within itself!</div>
