body: "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI wonder what piece of software most of you use to create typefaces?
  I have been advised to get Fontlab, details for fontlab :\r\nFontLab Studio + ScanFont
  Bundle for Mac OS X\r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/buy/\r\n\r\napparently this gets you
  the normal fontlab studio liscence (might want to check this covers multiple computers?)
  and also software that allows Professional font creation from scanned images.\r\n\r\nThis
  Costs: $699 or \xA3443.64\r\n\r\nIs there any way of finding this cheaper? Or any
  problems you have had with the software? Anyone use fontographer? What are the differences?
  Thanks. "

  body: Scanfont is a very useful application and works with either FontLab or Fontographer.
    Both Fontographer and FontLab produce professional quality font files but the
    learning curve on Fontographer is shorter while FontLab gives you more options.
    Many people use both for various parts of the process.

  body: You can get your feet wet by purchasing TypeTool, and get to know the basic
    FontLab interface. If you decide you want to move up to the next level, you can
    purchase an upgrade to FontLab Studio and actually pay a little less than if you
    had purchased FontLab in the first place.

  body: "@CaleD - It doesn't harm that it is easy to write a program that makes an
    SFD file -- easy when compared to writing a VFB generator.\r\n\r\nLast Friday
    I woke up very early with the urge to Hack Fonts Fast. Long to short, I hacked
    together code on the Linux box that converted EGA/VGA screen fonts to SFD, then
    used FontForge to create a TTF file. Goal achieved."
