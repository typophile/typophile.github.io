  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">First and foremost, I'm really naive to typography. My interest in this subject just started earlier this year, so please be gentle on me. :)

During the last few months on my extensive research about letter forms (before I started my 2nd attempt to make my first font), I stumble upon the word "Romanee" several times on almost every article that I've read. I first thought it was some sort of style in type design. 
That word keeps recurring into my head especially everytime I get my hands to work on my font. And now that I encountered it again on the article I'm currently reading, I can no longer contain my curiosity. So I searched for it via Google and here's what I found.

[[http://www.thechestnutpress.com/top-ten-typefaces.html]]

So... Romanee is actually an old metal (just assuming, not sure) type, and a very beautiful one at that.
The author states that the specimen shown there is his own digital revival of it which he's been working on for his personal use, which only means that it has never been revived by any type foundries.
I don't know how accurate that revival is, but it's really a fine piece of work.

For such a beautiful typeface to be left outdated is a total bummer.
I wonder how many more old typefaces of the same quality suffers the same fate...

By the way, the other typefaces below looks amazing as well.
But for now, my entire attention is on Romanee alone.
Sigh... If I only have access to the original specimen, I'll sure go attempt to make a revival too. ;)

Thanks for reading.
