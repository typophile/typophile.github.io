  questions about the MPAA rating letterforms, but my situation is a little different.
  \r\n\r\nWhile I know these types are varied and possibly illustrated by hand, I'm
  trying to create a simple piece of art mimicing the movie rating system but need
  to have a another letter(s) to come close as I can to the \"feel\" of the other
  already rendered by the MPAA.\r\n\r\nI've tried narrowing down a few fonts (ie;
  Latino Black, Melior Std Bold, Clarendon Std Bold and Egypienne Std Blk) that could
  come close or if need be modified to my liking but was wondering if any have further
  suggestions I could look for. Thanks in advance."

    at one point I had this same question. I ended up finding the logos online somewhere
    so didn't have to re-build them. But, IIRC I was just going to use Melior.\r\n\r\nHere
    is one link:http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/categories/movies/132046.html \r\nBut
    this isn't where I found it. "
