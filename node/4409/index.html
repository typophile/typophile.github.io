  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hrant, rather than add more clutter to the Top 10 thread, I thought I'd start a new one for our Fenway discussions. <BR> <BR>I finally had a chance to stop by the local B&amp;N magazine rack and take another look at those men's health/style mags.  <BR> <BR>In fact, <i>Men's Fitness</i> is indeed using Fenway. (Along with plenty of super chunky FF Bau by Mr. Schwartz &ndash; mmmm. And some slab-serif I don't immediately recognize.) Interestingly, they're using Fenway ff-ligatures, which IIRC the original cut didn't have. (And they aren't in the Fenway showing in the <i>Indie Fonts</i> book either.) <BR> <BR>I looked again at <i>BusinessWeek</i> and I still think that their setting is a little too tight. I think some uneven combinations are being created. Plus, those f-lig rsb's are still driving me crazy. <BR> <BR>BTW, it's <i>Men's Journal</i> that's using Farnham &ndash; sparingly: it looks like mostly some subheads, decks, leads. The main text face is FB Eldorado. Seasoned with plenty of Parkinson, Glypha, and Akzidenz.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">{Thanks for starting a fresh thread.} <BR> <BR>&gt; Men's Fitness is indeed using Fenway. <BR> <BR>Then they must have switched since the November '03 issue, which clearly is not Fenway: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/34072.gif" alt="SIvsMF"> <BR> <BR>The top is Fenway (in SI), the bottom is Zocalo (also used by Mexico's El Universal newspaper) in [my copy of] Men's Fitness. <BR> <BR>What's strange is that the November issue was when a redesign was launched (including new fonts), so did the readership hate it so much they did another redesign? But in that case it seems very unlikely they'd choose Fenway, since it's pretty close (superficially). Are you sure you were looking at Men's Fitness? <BR> <BR>&gt; Along with plenty of super chunky FF Bau <BR> <BR>I don't see no Bau, but another great Schwartz face: Amplitude. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
