  \ She found a font she likes on some literature.  Has anyone ever seen this font
  or anything close to it?  I've been searching all over the Internet and cannot find
  anything similar.  Someone may have created this font.\r\n\r\nANY help would be
  greatly appreciated, Karen\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MochaFont_6305.jpg]"

    comes more from the color and depth effects than the lettering itself. Nevertheless,
    here are some similar typefaces:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_humana_script/\">ITC
