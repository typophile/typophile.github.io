		<div class="commentbody">Hi!

Sorry, I don't understand the relationship between your company and the leaf/feather motif... if you're confused as well, work out the essence of what your company does and use that as a basis for your identity. It might be that a wordmark will suffice or you go down the using-your-company-intial route. I'm afraid nothing's jumping out at me: there seems to be a lot of polish (everything's had the full illustrator treatment with gradients etc.) and not much substance.

Switch off your Mac, get the pencil & paper out and force yourself to come up with a notebook page of ideas. Then weed out the ones you think are strongest. Then switch the Mac back on!

Sorry to be critical - it is constructive criticism, I'm not trying to put your work down; I'm really looking forward to seeing new ideas.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you very much Simon. Your critique is useful for me. 

But you know, I could not think about icon of my logo. My company is software provider. The logo company, at first used some icons like CD, mouse, etc inside logo. But it's not good icons for my company because we produce high level products. I thought that CD icon may be logo of CD burning program.


Can you suggest some icon for using in the logo? What do you think about text-only logo?

I agree with Si, in that I am unsure of the meaning in the leaf. I'm guessing this is something you requested though, as it is in most of the designs. I don't know what it says about your company and the products you produce. Sometimes it seems just tacked on for no reason -- like in #3, 5 and 7.

Also, in most of these, it is hard to determine the focus. Is the graphic or the company name more important? In nearly all cases the relationship between the graphic element and the text is weak, in my opinion. 

They all feel like they're <em>trying</em> a little too hard. Maybe something simpler -- for example, just a leaf graphic next to the name with no attempt to be clever about it being part of the 'R'.

Personally, I think the text in #3 is the strongest. None of the graphics strike me as memorable though.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you very much Lauren. I used of lead because simply I could not find other element to use. As Dan mentioned may be it's better to use text only logo.

What do you think about icon or element that I can use for my company? I can't find a icon for software company. We produce 3 strategic product: making help file for computer program, taking screenshot from computer user and making demo file (SWF) from applications. All of our products used by other companies and developers.

		<div class="commentbody">I think #1 is a strong mark: It is unique, simple, vaguely evocative of tools and technology, and makes an "R" without having an obvious plain old "R" sitting there. It's the sort of mark that could stay fresh for a long time as your company grows. The type, however, all looks like it was randomly thrown together.

The problem with these designs is that there are always three different elements competing for your attention: the mark, the word "Rasa," and the word "software." The effect is confusion. Instead, there should be two. That means either (A) eliminating the mark, (B) eliminating the word "software," or (C) making "Rasa Software" into one element, by setting it in one typeface in one size on one line.

The name of your company makes me think of "tabula rasa," the blank slate. The #1 mark is somewhat suggestive of the corner of a tablet/screen and a stylus. If you're going to try more marks, that may be a concept to explore further.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I find designing icons difficult - for the simple reason that they have the difficult task of summing up a concept in a very minimal way and communicate this efficiently. It seems from what you've told us that the company's field of work is quite diverse; to this end it would most probably be a strong solution to use a distinctive wordmark approach. I'd lose the leaf as it adds nothing except serving to confuse and pare everything down. Also a good idea would be to ignore the colouring at this stage and get something strong which works in black & white; keeping it strong and simple will let it work down at small sizes (which if you want something to appear on a OSX/WindowsXP desktop icon) will make the transition a lot easier. Think simple, not complex. If you look at most well-known brands, they work very well small, in single colour at their most basic.

I like the Rasa name, in itself that's a good start. Such a distinctive name should lend itself to a wordmark well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks very much. here is a very intersting forum. I learn from pro here a lot. I think duckworth is true. I decide to lose leaf and think about Rasa word itself.

But I have a very big problem in layout. layout of logos that designed by logo company are like this:

    R  
 R a  s a
 Software

layout of logo number 12 are like this:

++ Rasa

What do you think about layout. I think it is not very standard. I see a lot of famous brand at <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com">Brand of the world</a> website. they are always horizontally. but my owns are vertically.

How elemts exist at the logo like Rasa word, Software Word or R icon must arranged?

Does someone have a idea?

		<div class="commentbody">Many logos are set horizontally, with an icon to the left ot right of the name. I believe this is done more often so the logo can appear larger when (vertical) space on a page is limited. It's also just natural to "read" this way. 

Some companies have both a horizontal standard design, and an alternate "stacked" version for when space is limited in the other direction. This can get confusing though to have different versions of your logo.

You need to think about how your logo will be used. Which way makes more sense for your Web site, packaging, products, other promo materials?

Either way is "correct" if it works for you.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know that you want to take the 'brands of the world' web site too seriously. It is no measure of quality in my opinion.

I didn't really like any of the logos in the PNG. They were all too complicated, and worse without any purpose or reason for that complexity.

What Lauren Engelhard was saying about logo configuration is correct. There is often a horizontal & a stacked or 'vertical' version too. For instance both Starbucks Coffee, Microsoft do it. The main reason is that the name is long. This doesn't mean that a clever designer can't help you avoid the having two versions especially if you have a short name - but if not it's not a problem if you end up that way.

I suggest that you simplify the logo to the word 'rasa'. 

You don't need to explain what you do in a logo. That is a common but sophmoric mistake. Beside what you do may well change in the future and a description could undercut your flexibility.

I suggest a simple but robust type face with no ornamentation 

Try for instance typing RASA here:

http://www.typography.net/samplers/shires/derbyshire/index.htm

If you like it you can buy it here

http://www.typography.net/type/shires.htm

This idea may very well not be the best one, since I haven't thought about it for too long.  I suggest you listen to Simon Duckworth and simply begin again with a pencil but with one addition. Think carefully about what the logo is mean to do for you. What impact do you want the logo to have on your business? Think of the logo as an employee. What's his job exactly?
