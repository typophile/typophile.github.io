  that this is custom, but maybe something similar exists digitally?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NUMBERS_5756.jpg]"

  body: "It looks like it was at least inspired by <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/5845\"
    target=\"_blank\">Motter Ombra</a>, with the 'O' standing in for a '0', and modified
    '9' and '6'. It also looks a little stretched.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    href=\"http://www.dafont.com/dsmotterho.font\">DS Motter Hombre + Style</a>, and
    it's from the freeware departments. Therefore no luck with the numbers and many
    other original glyphs \u2026"
