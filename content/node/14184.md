  artists, illustrators, and lettering artists. I thought I'd post this offshoot here.
  \r\n\r\nI think Rick Griffin is my all-time favorite illustrator/lettering artist.
  His figures are so abstract but fit so well within his poster compositions. Most
  of his work is ultra-psychodelic, but is just so tight for something hand rendered.
  His 3-D lettering is my favorite out of his whole collection of work.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a link to some of his work:\r\nhttp://www.myraltis.co.uk/rickgriffin/\r\n\r\nAlso,
  there is a book that I have in my library called \"The Art of the Fillmore: The
  Poster Series 1966-1971\" that is a great resource of incredible lettering. Makes
  me wish there was still this level of technical precision with hand-rendered type.
  Wouldn't that be great?\r\n\r\n"

    for computer fonts pretty much rendered by hand? Or is it the thrill of working
    without an \"Undo\" command what you miss? Back in the olden days, \"undo\" meant
    white gouache, white mylar tape, or starting all over again. Been there, done
    that: I prefer the current method.\r\n\r\nBTW, I really like Griffin's work, too.
    My freeware font <strong>Circuit Bored</strong> was based on the lettering used
    at the bottom of the deadegypt poster."

    must admit that I learned \"to SEE\" by painting letterforms by hand and am glad
    I experienced it (40 or so years ago) but now that I have \"Seen Paree\", I am
    not going back to the farm.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    thread</a> that spawned this offshoot -- <em>Having spent many, many hours early
    in my career hand lettering headlines, and using lettering devices (Varigraph
    Headwriter, Leroy Pantograph) to create ads, I\u2019ve always admired lettering
    artists who had such a facility and love for the craft.</em>\r\n\r\nI used to
    think that \"doing things the old way\" sharpened my sensitivity to character
    shapes and spacing, but in giving my younger son a brief tutorial on Photoshop
    and Quark, I was astounded how quickly his work flourished.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
