  body: This looks like an odd customization of something like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.121025.0.20&attributes.sampleSize=74&sampleText=Kitchen&sampleSize=96">Univers</a>
    by someone not so experienced in type design. There are some awkward things going
    on here, especially in the 'K' and 'a'.

  body: My initial reaction was <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.108002.0.0"><em>Industria</em></a>
    by <strong>[[Neville Brody]]</strong>. But alas nae. Although it does look like
    the bastard child of <em>Univers</em> and <em>Industria</em>.
