body: Hi, I am doing some work regarding a restored gas station &#40;built in 1920s&#41;
  and am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on type from this period. If there
  is anywhere in particular I can look for ideas that would be greatly appreciated
  as well. Thanks!

    a copy of &#34;Trademarks of the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s&#34; by Eric Baker. <BR>
    <BR>There are also numerous resource books on the history of the American gas
    station at Amazon.com.  Just do a search for &#34;gas station.&#34;  A client
    just got several of the books for a restoration project of the same period. <BR>

    as well as any of her other books. While her books are not an all encompassing
    explanation on design theory from that time, they are amazing little time capsules
    for those of us which love these periods.'
