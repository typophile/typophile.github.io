  from old B&W Hollywood movies. The typeface was custom designed in vector format
  using a high number of colors to produce a realistic 3D effect.\r\n\r\nIt is perfect
  for display use, large format graphics, magazines, posters and 3D design.\r\n\r\nIt
  was showcased at Typography Served: http://www.typographyserved.com/gallery/Smoking-Club-Typeface/5410327\r\nMore

  body: "As nice as this design and implementation is, it is not a typeface or thefont,
    but a graphic alphabet. That is, it cannot be used in any standard computer application
    by entering via the keyboard. For all practical purposes, this is letter-shaped
    clipart.\r\n\r\nHerb"
