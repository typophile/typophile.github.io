  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The Elston Press is noted by one author, at least, as being the most important of New York&rsquo;s private presses.</p>
<p>When I stumbled onto one of their books on Google Books, I immediately noticed the strong resemblance to the books of William Morris:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/elston_4501.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>But on a [[http://www.elstonpress.com/PrivatePressTypes.html|web page]] about that press, to which I went in order to find information about the types used by that press, I found that they apparently made do with what they could get from ordinary sources, particularly ATF.</p>
<p>Initially, searching for the source of one typeface with an unfamiliar name led me to Lanston Monotype, but in fact the face originated at Barnhart Brothers &amp; Spindler, and continued its existence at ATF, being licensed, like Century Expanded, to Lanston.</p>
<p>But while the web page referenced above indicates that the sample from an Elston Press publication is likely to be in Caslon Old Roman, and an enlarged image on a [[http://www.galleyrack.com/images/artifice/letters/press/comptype/monotype/typography/composite-specimen/|web site about Lanston Monotype]] seemed to confirm that,  looking in specimen books for Barnhart</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/coroman_bbs_5275.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>and for Lanston Monotype</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/coroman_lmo_5972.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>instead gave the impression of a dated type not close enough to either the original Jenson or to a modification in the spirit of Morris' Golden Type to produce the attractive kind of private press book that Elston produced.</p>
<p>Of course, there could be more than one typeface under the name of Caslon Old Roman. (It was originally called just Old Roman, but a more condensed face was under that name in the BB&amp;S specimen book I looked at.)</p>
<p>Or it could just be subjectivity distorting my perceptions. The same BB&amp;S book gave extended body copy samples of Fifteenth Century, which looked far less bad than I would have expected (another name for that reprobate, Caslon Antique).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah. Looking at my post, with the specimen-book examples taken out of their context, they do not look so dated; but it is also clear that the sample from an Elston Press publication is, or seems to be, much bolder than they are, although not otherwise differing much in typeface.</p>
<p>In any case, I found the specific book alleged to be set in Caslon Old Roman on the web page from which I learned that name, and it was digitized more clearly; here is a sample from it:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/elston_hesp_3811.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>and again, it seems as good as the products of those private presses that commissioned their own types rather than simply buying suitable types from standard suppliers.</p>
