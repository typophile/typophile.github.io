  body: "I think this is something that has been modified. Could be as simple as removing
    part of the U serifs from Adobe's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/courier/\">Courier</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    spent a lot of time looking for slabs with U serifs like this, and I didn't see
    any. Even matching the R was not too easy, although it's possible serif amputation
    was used on the leg of the R. The \"Courier solution\" doesn't require that step,
    however.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Ah, I was wondering. Modified Courier makes sense. It looks cute with the
    half-serifs on the "U", but if it was actually a semiserif font, I'd suspect the
    serifs on the "R" and "T" would be different too.
