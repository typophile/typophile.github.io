body: "Hey all, this is my first time posting here, need some help on a logo. \r\n\r\nThe
  client is a photographer who focuses on music/band and fashion photography, aimed
  mostly at younger people. He says what sets his work apart from the rest is the
  way he captures colour and movement.\r\n\r\nThis is what i have tried to represent
  in the logo. The final roughs i think look OK, albeit rather cliched. The client
  has chosen the logo bottom right (despite me saying the extra swirls and colours
  seem a bit overcrowded, and that the swirls on the other logos 'sit together better).\r\n\r\nThe
  client is happy, but i can't help but think that i could make the logo more impressive.
  I'm not too hot on identities and logos (this is my first paid job), so any pointers
  are appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://s47.photobucket.com/albums/f196/mister_tech/?action=view&current=roughs7copy.jpg\"

  body: "I'm not feeling it...\r\n\r\nWhat is the name supposed to mean? No-ID(ea)?
    No name? - but that's a photographer's best asset.\r\n\r\nThe eye is definitely
    clich\xE9d - there's heaps more to explore - flashes, viewfinders, framing, viewing
    the world differently.\r\nIn my opinion doesn't really capture \"movement\". There's
    also the issue of being able to consistently reproduce that number of colours
    in a logo (you'll be printing CMYK every time.)\r\nCould you not simply use and
    abstract portion/crop of the photographers work next to the text, thus allowing
    some flexibility in the 'identity' you print that logo under a picture in a book
    etc and it'll take focus away from the image.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "Well the name itself is not down to me, i think the client already has it
    established and therefore can't be changed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the identity is mainly
    to be applied to his website (not printed onto every photo etc), although i'm
    not sure where else he would want it.\r\n\r\nHe stated he wanted an eye, so i
    couldn't be too creative with ideas either, i was going for an aperture ring effect
    inside the eye to link it with photography.\r\n\r\nGood point about the colours,
    though.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feeback :)"

  body: "My suggestion would be to design in one colour first (black on white) then
    add colour later.\r\n\r\nI don't see music/fashion aimed at younger people in
    this logo. It's too clean and subdued, but it is a good start. Try a different
    typeface.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I saw a rainbow sphincter and the picasa logo.  I didn't even see an eye
    until reading the discussion!\r\n\r\nI strongly agree with the advice to start
    with b&w, and also to try a different typeface.  Go for punky & distressed!  Perhaps
    retro art of an eye rather that's more stylized and less abstract.\r\n\r\nPlay
    with it!  I look forward to seeing what you come up with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "Hi there.\r\n\r\nI agree with the comment that you have to try black and
    white first, then add color to the logo.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend that you use a more
    \"youthful\" typeface, perhaps something more \"grunge\". You also have a great
    opportunity to create an \"eye\" out of the letter \"O\" of the name.\r\n\r\nPlay
    with this logo! Have fun with it!\r\n\r\n- Manuel\r\n\r\n\"Less is more\""

  body: I also saw the picasa logo, and the colors give me the idea of a print shop
    or graphics company.  I agree with others regarding the typeface that it's not
    "young" enough, maybe you can show movement in the typeface.  I just didn't feel
    it at first, but now that I've been staring at it for a while, I kinda like the
    left bottom one.

  body: "OK, I just went to the website.  I am sorry to say this, but I like the current
    identity (white sans on black bg, minimal) better than this one.   I think refining
    the minimalist look or going punk would both be good directions, but that the
    current logo proposals seem totally inconsistent with the brand.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"
