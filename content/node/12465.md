  body: "I think it's similar to one of the Century family of typefaces, such as <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-731/bold/testdrive.html?s=CAP%27N+CRUNCH&p=48\">Century
    731 (Textype)</a>. You would have to probably add some thickness, and the outlining
    and then bounce the letters, but I think that could simulate the lettering pretty
    well.\r\n- Mike Yanega"
