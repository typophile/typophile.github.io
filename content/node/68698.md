body: It's something I've never thought much about but I've seen it in a few fonts
  of late. Some fonts with oldstyle figures include currency symbols at or near the
  smallcap/OSF height. It seems like a good idea if you're going to have oldstyle
  numbers, but how frequently is this done? And which symbols should correspond to
  which of the varying number heights?

  body: "Depending on the font, I make up all the currency symbols, a numbersign,
    and the arithmetic operators. Size & position to fit comfortably with all the
    old-style numbers -- a bit of compromising is involved. Switched with the numbers
    in the lnum and onum features.\r\n\r\nAlso a colon, so, for example, 12:24 spaces
    better than the with the text colon. I include i, v, and x in the conditional
    set to include front matter roman numerals.  \r\n\r\nAgain depending on the font,
    I may make up a tabular comma and period as well."

    I am feeling particularly ambitious, I also include superior currency symbols:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figs_5897.png]\r\n(The
    fonts cost a bit more than that.)"
