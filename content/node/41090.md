body: "A while back, I did some simple OT development on a font that a friend of mine
  was commissioned to create based on the writing of a designer. He got that font
  back as well as a few others (ones I had nothing to do with) for minor fixes. Since
  he isn't as yet able to work with OT as yet, I agreed to do all the fixes. One of
  the complaints they listed was that the fonts were \"too small\". At this point
  I haven't been able to even communicate with the art director, but I know they are
  comparing it to another font with shorter ascenders/descenders. They also said this
  caused the preview in the character window to be too small to read. I know they
  are using InDesign (and WORD as well), but not sure yet which version.\r\n\r\nSo
  I started with one of the fonts that I didn't originally work on, did the changes
  and increased the size. Before I loaded it I checked the preview in the character
  window of InDesign CS3. It showed small and hard to read. After replacing with the
  new version (via Font Explorer) I expected the bigger size to show up, but it did
  not. I opened Illustrator and noticed it displayed the bigger size in preview. This
  is compared to the one that I developed next to it in the menu. I did find that
  you can increase the preview size in the preferences, but I'm wondering if Adobe
  apps keep some sort of preview cache that doesn't necessarily update itself.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas how to get a bigger character preview to come in properly? I should note that
  I don't have a great deal of experience with InDesign.\r\nStephen Rapp"

  body: "Font \"previews\" are all ostensible the same... the preview is a set size
    for ALL the fonts (unless the application has some feature to change those sizes).\r\n\r\nSome
    fonts specify an irregular UPM value in relation to their Ascender/Descender values.
    The UPM determines a font's \"scale\"... if your UPM is 1000, then there are 1000
    \"units\" per 1-point size. If your Ascender value is 700, and your descender
    value is 300, then you font should measure exactly to the point size (a 12-point
    setting would measure exactly 12 points from the top of an ascender to the bottom
    of a descender).\r\n\r\nBut a lot of fonts go \"over\" or \"under\" their Ascender/Descender
    values... I have seen a couple that have a UPM of 1000 but have an Ascender of
    over 2000! That means they look TWICE their size! Some fonts ignore limits altogether,
    so they clip off in some applications.\r\n\r\nYou want to increase the size of
    your glyphs relative to the UPM.\r\n\r\nGood discussion HERE: http://www.typophile.com/node/19130"

  body: "Thanks for the link, Scott.\r\nWhat I'm seeing in the font menu is the name
    in a standard face, and next to that a sample in the script of choice. These vary
    in size depending what the font is like.\r\n\r\nI do understand about the UPM
    values. The fonts were originally made a bit smaller because of the ascender/descender
    lengths, but I enlarged them 150%. I didn't want to go much bigger so as not to
    run into problems of clipping or excessively clashes at default leading. It seems
    to me that InDesign doesn't recognize the difference in the font menu preview.
    I don't know much about the inner workings of InDesign. At my day job we still
    use Freehand which has an uncanny way of holding onto old data that you might
    not want it to, especially regarding font updates. In Freehand a metrics problem
    that was fixed will sometimes come right back in. Retyping the glyphs will sometimes
    fix that.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "For displaying the Font sample and the glyphs in the Glyph palette, InDesign
    probably uses the font's bounding box to determine how much it needs to scale
    down the preview image to fit all the glyphs. If the difference between the largest
    and the smallest glyph in the font is big, the smaller glyphs will be displayed
    really small (and often unintelligibly) because InDesign is trying to fit the
    bigger glyphs. You can clearly see this happening with Bickham Script Pro (below).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID_bbox_4804.png]"

    look very insignifcant (comparitively) when scrolling through the character palette
    but it seems a bit much to modify the font (increase the scale) just for the possibility
    to have it look slightly better (bigger, clearer, bolder) in the character palette
