    this year's "Little Miss Sunshine"

    was frickin' funny, and <em>Juno</em> is supposed to be a good movie as well.

  body: I was wondering if I'd enjoy <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>. There were parts
    that were trying too hard. For instance, the son reads Nietzsche but when he finally
    expresses his anger at the world (the 2 times actually) his vocabulary is reduced
    to a bunch of 4 letter words. I'd have assumed he'd be able to be more articulate.
    The little girl was adorable though and the point made by the entire movie was
    nice.

  body: I think the reading Nietsche bit was more a way of making himself look cool.
    I fear his whole attitude was just that -- attitude. ;^)

  body: Yes. That is what I concluded too. I wanted to hug him anyway because his
    character reminded me of my nephew who is going through that stage of life right
    now too.

    Sort of.\r\n\r\nThat was a compliment.\r\n\r\nI liked the movie, but I liked the
    soundtrack even more. The music from the film is as naive as the font you're looking
    for.\r\n\r\nTry one of the many handwritten fonts on DaFont: [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=603]]"
