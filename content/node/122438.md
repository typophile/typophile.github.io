    and Radim Pe\u0161ko's [[http://www.radimpesko.com|Larish Neue (less Larish Alte)]].
    There are aslo in the same vein [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org|Colophon]] Fortescue,
    Value Serif, [[http://optimo.ch|Optimo]] Stanley, Markus John's [[http://tendollarfonts.com/products/rasmus|Rasmus]]
