  body: "This looks a lot like Mortimer Leach's hand-lettered Bodoni.\r\nThere is
    a similar digital version, the one used for your image, that is called Didi by
    ICG, but the contours have lots of things to be fixed (like the counter of the
    'd').\r\n\r\nI would recommend James Montalbano's Terminal Design 'Yo Andy' or
    'Yo Frankie' families.\r\nhttp://www.terminaldesign.com/Fonts/#/YoAndy/TypeTester\r\n\r\n"
