    wireless USB Logitech mouse and like it just fine \u2014 it uses a wireless USB
    receiver instead of Bluetooth, which I hate, and it's small enough to throw in
    my bag if I need to use it with my laptop. I don't feel super strongly about it,
    but I like it and you can't beat the price."

    in your hands, super fast and crazy accurate.\r\nSetup your custom buttons and
    you will never go back using a other mouse, believe me.\r\nBest mouse out there."

  body: I use the Logitech B100, the better I've use ever. I work with this mouse
    all day with no wrist or shoulder pain. But your ergonomic site (chair, table)
    has to be well set up.

    a gaming mouse but who cares it is great for work also."

  body: I like the current Apple mouse ("Magic Mouse"), mainly because the surface
    works like a track pad, allowing zooming and multidirectional scrolling with no
    moving parts. It also has one- and two-finger swipe gestures for switching between
    pages or screens, which I use. I might look like it has only one button (the entire
    surface), but it has both left and right button function. And I like that it's
    wireless.
