    clearly see its spacing is so-so and its lowercase 'e' is cramped and hangs to
    the left. Use Times Roman whenever possible -- in print (again), this comes out
    clear and very readable."

  body: "Times New Roman is a very ordinary font and it suffers from having a truly
    ugly bold which doesn't match the roman. The capitals are too heavy and wide.
    (Try looking at German copy set in Times) The italic is also too wide \u2013 it
    probably had to match the width of the roman when it was originally drawn \u2013
    and is also boring. Did I mention the bold? It is ugliness incarnate. Why this
    font is the mainstay of the desktop poster maker is beyond me.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone
    wants to use a Times style typeface I suggest Times Classic by Dave Farey which
    is truly magnificent but possibly not commercially available yet.\r\n(You can
    post me the cheque Dave)"

  body: "Times New Roman is a terribly <em>overused</em> typeface. But that isn't
    likely to change, and it's not just because of its availability.\r\n\r\nBack when
    it was less heavily used - in 1968, for example, when a book set in Times instead
    of Baskerville or Imprint or Century Expanded or Number Twenty-One or Caledonia
    or Garamond or even Weiss Roman actually stood out from the crowd - it looked
    fresh and new and modern, but without being <em>excessively</em> or self-indulgently
    modern, the way a book set in Helvetica, Univers, or Optima might have seemed
    - it would be clear that it is a face of great beauty.\r\n\r\nI think it's not
    just a <em>good</em> typeface, but a <em>great</em> typeface. Things move faster
    these days, so perhaps it won't last quite as long... but I think that a very
    apt comparison is to categorize it as the Caslon of today.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt,
    use Times.\r\n\r\n(Of course, you can still show you can afford extra fonts for
    your computer by using Palatino for your resume instead. But if you don't have
    extra fonts, I would suggest that Times is to be preferred to Arial, let alone
    Comic Sans, for that purpose.)"

    Roman was an improvement.\r\n\r\nThe only other proportionally-spaced choice back
    then would have been Arial. This was before Georgia came along. (I think we can
    leave Comic Sans and Impact out of consideration, don't you?)\r\n\r\nSo the choice
    of Times Roman over Arial comes down to it being a serif typeface, which is generally
    considered more readable and legible. Thus, I would assign primary responsibility
    for the choice of Times Roman specifically not to Marc Andreessen, but to Bill
    Gates and Steve Jobs. <em>They</em> could have built Windows around Caledonia
    or Baskerville instead, had they so chosen.\r\n\r\nBut I think that Times was
    already so popular in the market that they really just went along with the flow
    as well."
