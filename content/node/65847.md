  after reading a few forums posts and tutorials I'm still at a loss. I have open
  what I think are the most important windows, hopefully. Is there any chance it is
  caching? I installed it to see if it worked prior to kerning, I'm thinking this
  is a potential issues as well? don't think this is it since the font was changed,
  which worked but the kerning stayed the same.\r\n\r\nhttp://localhostr.com/files/ea1344/Picture+2.jpg"
