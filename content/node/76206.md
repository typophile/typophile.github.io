  at all in a work, then anywhere titling figures appear, it'd better be in an all
  caps environment. But if we're to really stick with the\r\n\r\nold style figures
  : titling figures :: lowercase : upper case\r\n\r\nanalogy, wouldn't that mean the
  '7' in\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nought not to have that descender? After all, in words,
  it would be \"Chapter Seven.\" (It actually makes me pause when I see \"September
  23, 2010\" and all the numbers are text figures. That can't be good, right?) But
  then, following the rule strictly, \r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nought to have two different
  styles for the two different '1's. !!! =(\r\n\r\nAnother issue: the longer I stare
  at text figures mixed with small caps, the more out of place it looks. Why aren't
  there small caps figures too? Everything's looking ugly and I don't know what to
  do."

  body: "Some of the more complete text faces do have small caps figures. If you're
    running into that issue a lot, you should get one.\r\n\r\nAs for \"capitalization\",
    numbers can't be made to follow exactly the same rules as words. I think it's
    sensible to want lining figures where you would expect a capitalized word; a book
    title like <em>22 Facts About Cheese</em> begs for lining figures. But both digits
    should be lining, of course."

  body: "IMO, figures in headlines and titles should generally be lining.\r\n\r\nBecause,
    as Kevin observes with \"22\", some combinations of old-style figures are just
    too small, and can look like a \"wrong font\" mistake.\r\nThis is camouflaged
    in body text, where the full variety of old style figures appears.\r\n\r\nSince
    I've been making fonts in the OpenType format, all those with small caps have
    included small-cap-height lining figures, which are deployed by the OpenType menu
    command \"All Small Caps\". Several other type designers do likewise, so look
    for recently-designed typefaces to have this feature.\r\n\r\n"
