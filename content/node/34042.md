  early 70s, but \r\ncould anyone help in possibly identifying this typeface, with
  or without the block shadow? Thanks in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b79c_1_5710.JPG.jpg]"

  body: "I looked through several books of Photo-Lettering and other film types, which
    were widely used in the 70's. The open typeface which has the closest 'G' I could
    find was called Henrion Weight (In Photo-Lettering Catalog Vol 2). I don't know
    of any digitizations of this.\r\n\r\nFor something similar in digital form, I
    think <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/folio-sb/\">Folio</a>
    has some weights that have this approximate shape and a somewhat similar G. I
    little shape manipulation could make the resemblance stronger, and Folio was designed
    in the late 50's - early 60's, so it fits the era.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
