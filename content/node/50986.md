body: "For school I was assigned to redesign the entire corporate identity for a company
  of my choice, starting with the logo. I chose Verizon because their current logo
  is thought to be one of the worst designed logos ever. I don't know if it's \"the
  worst\" but it certainly is pretty awful looking.\r\n\r\nKey ideas that I'm trying
  to express are connection, broadcast, communication. The circles to me represent
  both communication, as well as a literal representation of broadcasting. An open
  network. An ever growing circle. These are all still in their early stages. The
  typeface I'm using is Gotham by Hoefler and Frere-Jones. Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Indeed, Verizon is one of the ugliest logos out there. That said, it's unique
    enough to be readily identifiable in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nWhat you have is
    a start, but is a fairly generic form/concept. I think you need to spend some
    more time further exploring ideas.\r\n\r\nAnd Gotham is a great typeface, but
    these days, it might warrant a bit of a push away from it. There's going to be
    a lot of student portfolios coming out the door with Gotham everywhere."

  body: "I like the third one. Focusing on the link seems to be a good idea, because
    Verizon is known for their strong connection (except on the left side of my room).
    However, the circles jumble together a bit, seeing as how they are all the same
    stroke width. Try varying the strokes, or eliminating the outer two circles all
    together and focusing on that one link.\r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to focus
    on the \"network\" premise, as they seem to be big on that right now."

  body: "Its funny. I work for an interactive Agency that does all of Verizon's online
    advertisement and web pages. Yes the logo is terrible. Myriad Pro is their corporate
    face if you care to include that (or it could be interesting to turn away from
    that completely).\r\n\r\n@aluminum: Yeah that logo is pretty ugly especially how
    they highlight the Z. Oh and the way the dot of the \"i\" sits bothers me. There
    are 2 versions actually. One where the V's ends tapers off and another where it
    fades away at the ends.\r\n\r\nI agree with the complaint that its a little generic.
    Why not take the company's history as a starting point. They are the second biggest
    phone company in the world and actually offer the fastest form of internet in
    the US (if FiOS is available in your city). That could be another point.\r\n\r\n@aluminum
    again: I hope you are wrong about students and Gotham. I just branded a start
    up company with Gotham rounded. Oh well"

    logotype as well, and have noticed quite a few others since then.'

  body: "I like the original third one, but I find that the uniformity of the line
    width in the design, and the uniformity in stroke width in the text leave me feeling
    very cold and as though I am looking at a machine.\r\n\r\nI think that although
    technically, this logo is well executed, I feel that adding certain flair to it
    could much improve the experience and message it communicates.\r\n\r\nWhat if
    the circles had a varying width, one thicker part and one thinner part?\r\n\r\nWhat
    if the type used a slightly more human-friendly typeface?\r\n\r\nPlay with it,
    I don't think it's done, but I do think you're definitely on to something good
    here too!"

  body: "I might be in the minority but I like the new version 2.\r\nThe 3 circles
    seem like circles for the sake of design. I know you are going for the communication
    theme. I guess these are waves or signals being cast out? Its a little abstract.
    It doesn't make me think twice.\r\n\r\nThe 2 rings feel like they actual mean
    something. Perhaps a dialog between 2 sources. Play that up maybe.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.logopond.com]]
    is a great resource for logo trends and examples.\r\n"

  body: "I'm seeing two words; VERIZ and ON. Also, with its pure forms, I'm thinking
    this direction is a little too modern as a replacement for the real Verizon logo.
    They have to appeal to a very large group of people. I don't think you're tackling
    that part of the challenge of a Verizon logo redesign.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "I agree with the bolding making a separation between the 'Veriz' and the
    'On'.  I've seen that used most publicly in Apple's branding as a delimiter between
    words:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iphone_5347.png]\r\niphone3G\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/macbook_4541.png]\r\nMACBOOKair\r\n\r\nAnd
    the other place I've seen this is even more serious when you consider the nature
    of the Business: Bell Canada, a very popular Telecommunications company started
    by Alaxander Graham Bell (inventor of the telephone) himself.\r\n\r\nBell recently
    went through a change in corporate identity, and has turned heads, especially
    in the design community with their new website.  The entire new campaign and branding
    also focuses on the emboldening of any 'er's in the text, and because Verizon
    and Bell are in the same industry, I think at that point that would be fresh in
    any designers mind when viewing your logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bell_5413.png]\r\n\r\nNow,
    I highly doubt you intended this, but if I were you now that word is out, I think
    I would change it just so the next person who comes along (and may not be as open-minded
    or forgiving) doesn't just assume you ripped off some Canadian telcom company
    for your logo.\r\n\r\nBest of luck, I wanna see what you come up with, cheers!"
