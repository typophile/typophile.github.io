body: "I've been reworking some old proprietary PS fonts for someone who needed the
  character sets filled out and will be using in Flash as well as other apps. The
  first one came out fine. Then I worked on one that is a formal script. All seemed
  well until I had a peek at it for the first time in Illustrator. OUCH! In the glyph
  palette (see below) you'll notice that some letters are extremely distorted. \r\n\r\nI
  thought maybe it might be some kind of hinting error. I don't know how to hint ttf
  fonts so I tried removing hinting, autohinting, etc. No matter what I seem to do
  I get the same results. Not sure why C is fine but \xC7 is not. When I type it looks
  fine until I zoom out a ways. Then I get the same distortions as the glyph palette.
  I tried the old PS version in Illustrator with no problems. Any ideas how to resolve
  this?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Glyph_palette_4354.gif]"

  body: "I had already decomposed and merged contours. I'm not seeing any duplicate
    paths on the ones that show up bad. I hadn't reset to TT curves and direction
    because I thought that when you generated it as a Windows TrueType/OpenType font
    that conversion was automatically made. Anyway\u2026 I went ahead and tried that
    and still had the same problem. On the \xC7 I had a change. On that particular
    character I had copied from the old PS version. Then this time around I went back
    and put in the new C and cedilla (with cleaned up outlines). The \xC7 was better,
    but not right. The cedilla seemed to show as a heavy spot on the curve rather
    than hanging below. It was merged and showed no bad points in Font Audit.\r\n\r\nI'm
    wondering if scaling the font up to 2048 from the 1000 would help. Also\u2026
    is it best to remove hinting, autohint, or maybe leave only horizontal hints since
    the verticals have nothing to align to?"

  body: Occasionally, I have encountered some kind of voodoo in a .vfb file that defies
    any fix I can throw at it. In such instances, I have generated a PS Type 1 font,
    then opened the generated font in FontLab, and the problems have gone away. This
    process may not solve your problems, but it's worth a shot...

  body: "I'm wondering if I just copy everything into a new font window including
    kerning data and see if that might do it. The first font that I reworked I did
    this way and had no problems. This one I just opened in FL and reworked directly.
    The font was a very old proprietary PS font and had some weird things to start
    with. Like\u2026 whoever put together composite characters just used any random
    dicritic slot. So there was a tilde in the circumflex cell and they used dotaccent
    in place of dieresis. I might see if that helps fix it."

  body: "Fixed it. The font was very old with many updates, but still had diacritics
    mapped incorrectly, no extremes on curves, etc. After fixing all that and pasting
    in a new font window using the paste special command to avoid carrying any unnecessary
    legacy data I managed to get it working. Also followed Mr. Shinn's notes.:-)\r\n\r\nThanks
    guys."
