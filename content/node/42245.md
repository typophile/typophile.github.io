  in the above, not the (condensed) logotype used for the title, but the font used
  in the different categories (\"characters\", \"story\", etc).\r\n\r\nI tried to
  use 2 web font identification tools, and the results were Olympian (not even close)
  and VandenKeere. Perhaps the font is a display version of the VandenKeere text font?
  There appear to be some slight differences, but its hard for me to tell.\r\n\r\nThx..."
