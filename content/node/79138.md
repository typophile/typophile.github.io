body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI designed some alternate glyphs to lower case and small caps.
  Making the opentype feature to swap the regular lowercase to the alternate lowercase
  was easy. I then made the small caps opentype feature. But when I mix both features
  I don't get what I expect. The sc -e- is being swapped with its alternate glyphs
  but the A (which does not have alternate glyph in sc) also swap with the alternate
  lc -a-. The result is, I get a mix of small caps, alternate lc and alternate small
  caps.\r\nI do something wrong but cannot figure out. I guess I need to create an
  aalt feature for swapping the regular lowercase with the alternate ones (with 2
  classes with the regular lc and another with the alternate lc) and I also need to
  create a second aalt feature with classes that include small caps in one class and
  alternate small class in another. But this doesn't seems to work either :(. Anyone
  might have some advice to resolve my problem ?\r\nI made a pics to explain visually
  my problem.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/expli_5247.jpg]"

  body: "Most likely, you've got your features defined in the wrong order.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm not clear on why you're using the 'aalt' feature here. I'd use a stylistic
    set (e.g. ss01). 'aalt' isn't normally a user selectable feature -- it's used
    \ by things like the glyph palette for determining which alternates are available
    for a given glyph.\r\n\r\nMake sure your 'smcp' and 'c2sc' features are defined
    before your 'ss01' feature.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    :)\r\nChanging the features order (and reorganising my classes) make it works
    fine . thanks for your help !"

  body: "http://www.typophile.com/node/17887#comment-109421\r\n\r\nAlso, the ordering
    of the feature definitions in FontLab Studio's OpenType panel is important. If
    you place your \"ss01\" or \"salt\" above \"smcp\", then \"ss01\" or \"salt\"
    will take precedence when used together with \"smcp\". This means that first \"a\"
    will be replaced with an alternate \"a\", and then \"smcp\" may try to replace
    the alternate \"a\" with an appropriate alternate small-cap \"a\". If you place
    \"smcp\" first, then it will be applied first, so first \"a\" will be replaced
    with a small-cap \"a\", and then your \"ss01\" or \"salt\" might try to replace
    the small-cap \"a\" with an appropriate alternate small-cap \"a\". \r\n\r\nBoth
    ways are workable, but you need to write your feature definitions to take into
    account the order of the features in which they are applied in combination. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    does. It uses \"salt\". InDesign on the other hand uses \"ss01\"-\"ss20\". Both
    also use \"swsh\". \r\n\r\nAFAIK, the most up-to-date version of the table that
    lists which OpenType Layout features are supported in various applications is:
