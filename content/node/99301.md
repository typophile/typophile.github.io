  to figure out what typeface this was created from.  The designer that originally

  body: "Could very well be!  The 'S' sticks out to me from the rest as too perfect
    to be handwritten, which is why I'm hoping that it could be a typeface.  I also
    think the kerning might not have been manually adjusted, which led to the overlapping
    of some of the characters the way they sit now.\r\n\r\nBut I agree it definitely
    has a hand-written feel.  Hopefully someone has seen it somewhere before!"

    the starting point.  \r\nTHANKS!!!\r\n\r\nI figured out that the S is Ministry
