I&rsquo;ve asked what kind of computers and software companies use at interviews and, if they are using old equipment I try to see if they&rsquo;ll be upgrading or willing to as part of the job.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a worldwide company with design departments spread around the globe I can see the logic of what they are doing. They probably invested heavily into one system and software to cut down on compatibility issues years ago and kept up with it.</p>
<p>Myself, I much prefer working on a Mac, because i know the OS and hot keys; but Windows isn&rsquo;t all that bad, just different. If it was a design studio using just PC&rsquo;s I might be a little more hesitant.</p>

<p>You can drag icons to the start button to add them to the first pop-up when you hit the window key. Or drag them to the toolbar down where you probably already see the IE icon.</p>
<p>You can fill the toolbar up with icons if you want (you might have to unlock the toolbar). You just have less room to see what is open.</p>
<p>I have been a Windows user all my life, and just switched to Mac. I have never used Vista, and I have heard complaints, but suffice to say, you&rsquo;ll be probably be OK and live to tell about it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a designer, but I wouldn&rsquo;t turn down a job just because I had to use Windows rather than OS X.  If that&rsquo;s the only thing holding you back, take the job, figure out which of your co-workers are the gurus and let them know that you&rsquo;re quite competent with OS X and InDesign but need to get quickly up to speed on Windows and Quark.

Despite what others have said above, Quark is a very solid design/layout program. I know InD lets you import your keyboard shortcuts from Quark (which was a HUGE help to me since I learned Quark way first) but I&rsquo;m not sure it works the other way around. In any event, intuitively the programs are very similar and Quark even has a few features sorely lacking in InDesign such as customized kerning tables, very important for type purists.</div>

<p><strong>Come over to the Dark Side, Katherine!</strong>  ;-D</p>
<p>I kid. I spent several years working only with Macs. And then, one day, I started a job where each designer had a Mac <em>and</em> a PC. At first it was troublesome, but pretty soon I got the hang of it. I am no longer at that job, but learning how to use a Windows machine was helpful. I still prefer Macs, though (sorry, Darth).</p>
<p>As for QuarkXPress, back in Version 3.x days, the Windows version was awful. Nowadays it is pretty similar to its Mac counterpart. I too have my InDesign keyboard shortcuts set to the Quark 4 shortcuts! But you can&rsquo;t set Quark to InDesign shortcuts&hellip; Sorry.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just did the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; to mac due to a new job&hellip; I worked on macs while being at university, then &ldquo;returned&rdquo; to windows (XP) because it still felt more natural to me (it&rsquo;s all about being used to a system), and now I returned to OSX again&hellip;
I did Indesign, xPress, Illu, Photoshop, HTML-Coding, making books, marketing material, fonts and everyday work on the system, and it was very reliable and in 5 years there were no compatibility issues with printing services, fonts, or when exchanging data with other windows- or osx-machines. So: it works.</p>
<p>After one week on OSX, I am at about lets say 60% of my usual working speed, but I am slowly getting used to it, adjusting the system and getting used to it. I&rsquo;ve learned that one has to tweak OSX as well as one has to tweak Windows, out of the box both of them are hard to get used to if you compare it to a machine fully adjusted to your needs you used before. So if you give Windows a chance, it&rsquo;s possible to work with, but don&rsquo;t be frustrated in the beginning&hellip;</p>

Having said that, it wouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult to adjust, it&rsquo;s only platform/software after all! I&rsquo;ve worked with both platforms and both applications, and it&rsquo;s just a question of getting used to it. If everything else about the new job and other circumstances (move etc) are just about perfect, I&rsquo;d go for it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I interviewed for this job 9.5 years ago, one question was &ldquo;What kind of computer do you work on and what software do you use?&rdquo; My immediate answer, given with no hesitation was &ldquo;I work on a Macintosh and use Quark. But I&rsquo;ll learn whatever machine/software you folks use here.&rdquo; I did know that my predecessor used used Windows and Quark [InDesign was just a glimmer then].</p>
<p>I had never even sat at a Windows machine. But I knew I was smart enough and nimble enough to make the machine switch. And I wanted the job: the type of work, the added money, the new responsibilities, the shorter commute.</p>
<p>These are the sort of things you should think about. They are not asking you to switch religion [I hope], or to get rid of your dog and get a cat. It is just a damn machine.</p>
<p>Think through what you really want. Machines and software can be mastered.</p>
<p>powers</p>
<p>PS: I was offered the job. Before the offer was made, the Managing Editor talked with other book designers and found that Mac / Quark was the preferred combination. On the day she asked me to come to work here she also said &ldquo;Give me a Macintosh shopping list.&rdquo; So in the end I had not to make the switch. But I was ready, and I like to think that honest willingness to shift was a factor.</p>
<p>Still using Quark.</p>

<p>That closes the window you were working in, not the program itself! In most cases, you could have several windows per program open. Difference between a Mac and a PC. PC&rsquo;s have windows nested inside other windows, while Mac OS tends not to.</p>

I started on OS 9 using Quark, bought a Powerbook and taught myself InDesign, built a PC so I could work on the Quark files at home (my newspaper got rid of their PCs, so yay for me, a free Quark license!)</p>
<p>I was used to my nice Powerbook and Creative Suite workflow when I took a job at a newspaper that used OS 9 and Pagemaker 5. Talk about a step backwards.</p>
<p>And how did things turn out differently? Nothing changed. You place some photos, you wrap some text around it, you hit print.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, always before considering a job, find out from the company who had the job before you. Why do they no longer have it? Did they move up the ladder? Did they leave cursing up a storm? How long did they have the job - how many people have had this position?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Although I&rsquo;m pretty much the biggest mac fanboy there is, I wouldn&rsquo;t pass up a 30% raise at a great firm just to have to work on a pc. The quark thing may be the downside for me. I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone still uses it, especially with the new creative suites. I feel like quark impedes my process so much that the result is lower quality work. I&rsquo;d personally say go for it though, and hope that quark waves the white flag before cs4 comes out in a year or so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use Quark 6 on a mac, but use Indesign CS2 on a PC with newer versions on Illustrator and Photoshop so I have to switch between mac and pc all day.  I don&rsquo;t know PC&rsquo;s as well as macs but have to say I much prefer working on the mac, dragging whatever you want into the icons is so much handier than using menus to open stuff every time, along with everything else that&rsquo;s handier on a mac, but I am new to PC&rsquo;s so I may have some more to learn there. Quark 7 is close enough to indesign if they have that, don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s selling well mind you, I could count the quark 7 files I received so far on one hand, PDF&rsquo;s produced are OK but still not as good or as small as those from indesign&hellip;you shouldn&rsquo;t have too much trouble with quark if you know indesign but you will have more work to do, especially on a PC, which are a lot cheaper than macs, but I have to say they feel a lot cheaper too&hellip;.take the job and if it doesn&rsquo;t work out I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find another one anyway.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Please excuse this outburst, but since switching to Mac in late January, the thing that strikes me as completely blowing away PCs is the search function. The magnifying glass in the upper right corner searches not just file names, but inside .pdf and various text files files and Word docs, spreadsheets, e-mails, etc. (on all your drives) and gives you a definition from the dictionary as fast as you can type it in the search field. Stunning the first few times; still pretty amazing.</div>
