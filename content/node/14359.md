  Script</a> for names for my sis's wedding invites. what should i set text in? Would
  Californian be OK? or something more along the lines of Bodoni? oh, and <a href="http://www.annswedding.com/ProductCluster.cfm?prev=1&TempPrev=0&blnPreviewRequestSubmitted=0&recordsperpage=9&CompletedOrder=0&sBasketID=0&ClusterItem=Clust3099&iSubGroupID=1405&alogo=1&menu=none&morethanonepage=YES&HostDomain=0&FirstTimeThrough=1&option=ProductCluster.cfm&format=PG0269&CFID=1814966&CFTOKEN=70572151">here's

  are welcome.

  body: "Bodoni?! It's a wedding, not a funeral.\r\n\r\nWhy not just use Ministry
    (a great match for those cards - which are nice btw) for everything? Everybody
    knows what a wedding invitation says anyway. As long as the numerals are unambiguous
    (for address & date/time) you should be fine. Just maybe lighten the names manually,
    since you'll probably be setting them larger, but you don't want them to scream
    - unless it's that kind of wedding I guess.\r\n\r\nBTW, with all those kerning
    pairs I bet you're\r\nseriously tempted to include a colophon eh?  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'i think you''re right hrant. that''s the conclusion i was coming to--all
    in ministry. i think i''ll set it without frills (well you know what i mean!)
    except the names, which i''ll fancy up a bit (hopefully not <em>too</em> much.
    i have a tendency to overdo that kinda thing.) so i''ll pitch all ministry at
    my sis, but for some reason she wanted everything in a plain text font (but the
    names) so just for backup, still taking suggestions... '

  body: Paul,  OT, but I can't find a link to your website anymore.  You had a font
    that was unreleased.  I wish I could remember the name but I can't.  Are you planning
    on releasing this anytime in the near future.  Thanks, Sharon

    fonts for a while, but if you''re interested in a particular one i might be able
    to finish it up for you. try to describe it in an email and we''ll figure it out.
    if you click on the contact tab on my profile, you should be able to reach me
    that way. '

  body: hello, is this thing on? well i attached a PDF of what i've got so far, but
    i'm not sure anyone will be able to view it!!! (the attachment is attached to
    my first post) Anyhow, if you CAN view it, i did lighten the names a bit, but
    did i do enough? Did i go overboard with swashes? (i tend to do that) anyhow,
    hopefully i can get a crit on this somehow. I'm afraid i might have to post a
    jpeg or a gif for anyone to see... i might do that just now...

  body: I think too many typefaces on those cards would be certain death anyway, so
    Ministry Script is fine. I like the treatment, but I think I'd like the bride
    and groom's names just a wee bit smaller and / or lighter. They're kinda shouty
    right now, or at least the disparity in sizes between the small and large text
    makes it seem so.

  body: Paul, try to find different alts when you have descender and asceder colliding.
    Is there a way to combine them? I would have really like to see a separate typeface
    combined with this. Why? I think, in this instance, especially since the enlarged
    letters appear to be heavier weight, that a different typeface would allow the
    two names, in the script, to appear ... hmmm ... more hand drawn? I can't think
    of the word. Does this typeface have different weights?

  body: okay, check out the redux version attached to the first post... i agree with
    norvell, those names were just <em>too</em> huge. hopefully they're better now.
    as stated before i <em>did</em> lighten the names up a bit, but do i need to go
    further? (this face doesn't have different weights). should the names match the
    rest of the text in weight? or is it ok for them to be slightly heavier? tiff,
    are there any spots in particular where the ascenders/descenders are a problem?
    any other feedback? thnx for what you've given so far!

  body: Much better, and I still think using the single face works well in context.
    With the tweaked sizes, I don't think it needs to be any lighter.

  body: Paul, with the changes you made -- sorry for not noticing you had changed
    the weights -- I think the main areas have been resolved. The descender g, in
    Egan, no longer bumps into the Ch, in Charles. As well, reducing the contrast
    in size helps with the visual divergence of the two point sizes. Could you make
    the names a little lighter?
