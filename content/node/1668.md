body: So, I was wearing last year&#39;s Typophile Tee at a local coffee shop last
  night &#40;Farley&#39;s for those of you in San Francisco&#41; and a guy came up
  to me and said, &#34;Why would are you wearing a California Job Case on your chest?&#34;
  I was floored. It&#39;s the fist time since I&#39;ve been wearing this shirt that
  someone actually knew what it was &#40;my desiger friends of course recognize it
  in general, my students, sadly, do not&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve had many comments
  on the shirt, including &#34;nice shirt, I love Mondrian,&#34; but that was the
  first time the design has been &#34;outed.&#34; I thought I&#39;d share, on the
  eve &#40;I think&#41; of the new shirt being announced.  <BR> <BR>Hopefully it gives
  Graham a little tickle...

  body: That is funny. Mondrian! <BR> <BR>To tell you the truth, I wouldn&#39;t have
    known it was called a &#34;California Job Case&#34; before I designed it.  I had
    the idea for the graphic, and then looked through my 1923 ATF catalog for one
    that looked like the ones I&#39;d used in school.

  body: 'Jared,  <BR> <BR>I did indeed &#34;typovangelize.&#34; It started with me
    earnestly insisting &#34;No, no! Typo<i>phile</i> not typo<i>philia</i>!&#34;
    Once that was cleared up we talked about the site briefly and I urged him to check
    it out. It turns out he used to run a print shop and now has the entire thing
    &#40;three presses and who knows how many tons of type&#41; in storage. He does
    AutoCad now. <BR> <BR>We discussed about the possibility of him starting up again
    or deciding to sell the equipment. A good friend of mine bought that press that
    was posted on typographi.ca earlier this year &#40;I seem to be quite the hook-up
    artists&#41;, so we talked about that for a bit too. <BR> <BR>Of course, I don&#39;t
    go anywhere without a stack of self promo books, so I gave him one of those and
    wrote your URL on the inside front cover. &#40;I feel it&#39;s only right that
    I split my commission on hos memebrship with Graham, since his shirt was the catalsyt
    for the whole interaction. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Because the design is white on dark &#40;red&#41;,
    and blanks are <BR>easy to come by, we have the ability <BR>to substitute standard

    red, if anybody wants to. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know when these&#39;ll be sold,
    but something to keep in mind. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>

    you put it on, but the heat from your body turns it to blue and then red. hehe!

    <BR>I stand corrected...and sorry to commandeer the thread, but <BR>this stuff
    would be out of place, imo, within the other discussion <BR>about the contest...
    <BR> <BR>anyway, &#39;like&#39; just struck me as such a slippery word. Do you

    foreground type, and they say, &#34;Design is a good idea.&#34; But I&#39;ll still
    buy the shirt. I&#39;ll just have to bring in a different mousepad on the day
    I wear my typophile shirt.
