  body: 'Try to read the magazine -- I dare you. <em>All text</em> in Grafik is set
    in ITC Avant Garde Gothic. I wanted to read my own article ("Anatomy of a typeface:
    Odile" of almost a year ago) and couldn''t. I tried, I swear, but honest to God,
    it''s unbearable.'

    Please elaborate. (You can tell I've been watching a lot of <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/\">Deadwood</a>

  body: some of us are perfectly helpful; we're just tired of avant garde and the
    kneejerk irony applied to it these days.

  body: "I agree it's not easy to read, but it doesn't help the letter-spacing and
    leading are unnecessarily tight. \r\n\r\nJust thought I would also mention it's
    different from the Adobe Std, the captial R changes between book and bold, not
    so in the Adobe Std release."
