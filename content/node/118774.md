  album]] at a flea market yesterday and was struck by a typeface that appears near
  the bottom of the back cover, at around 12-ish point height. It's got some very
  distinctive features \u2013 classical proportions, somewhat extreme serifs on some
  letters (especially N), straight-leg, Trajan's-column-inspired R, unsual shapes
  to the G and S...\r\n\r\nSorry about the image quality. Phone camera tends to distort
  and blur non-centred macro objects.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_0216_4114.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  clue?"

    quite an unfortunate digitalization."

  body: "Birdseeding, I hadn't looked at the full album cover before--might have saved
    me some search time!\r\n\r\nAt first, I wasn't sure if I had it right, but I think
    it's a combination of poor reproduction on the album cover itself and the tendency
    of font digitization to be overly pristine."
