    is female. \r\n\r\nNot sure how to treat the final logo yet in regards to showing
    both together but what i've got is a start. \r\n\r\nI'm just looking for something
    to go along with it for any marketing material. Could be a brochure, website,
    tags. etc. "

    have if Jason had been the only one to make the mistake, but it happens quite
    often at Typophile so I thought it was time to say something. Your turn next Dave.\r\n\r\nIn
    answer to the question, not a lot of extended faces out there, but I believe that
    Zuzana Licko has made quite a few, so check out the Emigre catalog."

    for small use. that one would be thicker, and then they can use it for other things
    too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    resolution of embroidered labels is quite low, around 110 tph (threads per inch)
    horizontally, and strangely variable in the other direction. So unless your lettering
    is specifically \"pixelized\" (see \"TORONTO\"), fine type will get the jaggies."
