  are excited to release the award-winning <strong>Nassim</strong> by <strong>Titus
  Nemeth.</strong> \r\n\r\nThe typeface is \u2013 thanks to its use by BBC Arabic
  and BBC Persian \u2013 one of the most read webfonts in the world today with around
  56 milion readers each month. It was first released in 2008 with the Tasmeem software.
  With the current new and revised release in OpenType technology, Nassim is, for
  the first time, now available for all mainstream software environments, allowing
  for high quality Arabic typesetting across platforms and media. It lends itself
  equally well to Arabic and Farsi, thanks to the dedicated Persian letter drawings.\r\n\r\nNassim
  comes in four weights with \u201CNassim Latin\u201D supporting more than 63 languages
  using Latin script, and \u201CNassim Arabic\u201Dwith additional support for Arabic,
  Persian, and Urdu. Pan-European Latin is included in all fonts by default.\r\n\r\nNassim
  received acclaim from its first public appearances. It was awarded the <strong>\u2018Certificate
  of Excellence in Type Design\u2019</strong> at the <strong>TDC\xB2 2007</strong>,
  first prize for <strong>\u2018Original Typeface Design\u2019</strong> at the <strong>European
  Design awards 2007</strong>, and was shortlisted as <strong>\u2018Design of the
  Year 2007\u2019</strong> by the <strong>Design Museum London</strong> and featured
  in the accompanying show. \r\n\r\nRead more about the family at: [[http://www.rosettatype.com/Nassim]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nassim_slide_2_6739.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nassim_slide_3_4895.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nassim_slide_4_3961.png]"
