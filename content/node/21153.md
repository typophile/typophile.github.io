  body: "What was the reason for making the new fonts smaller?\r\nWas it to appear
    more \"posh\" -- like book faces, rather than news text faces -- or was it to
    accomodate the accents in wider encodings? Or are the fonts on a standardized
    x-height, pegged at the typeface with the smallest x-height? Or something else?"

    points-per-inch higher, which shrinks 'em. This is why they are 8-7 pt. optical
    masters, not the 10-12 pt. they should be. \r\n\r\nCT is the first technology
    ever released where non-bozo users are recommending the use of the monospaced
    font as the best of the bunch. "
