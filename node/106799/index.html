  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone, first post here.</p>
<p>I found typophile while looking for some infos about Bembo Std (picked up from the Adobe shop) which I&rsquo;m using for a book.
First of all in the Adobe page there&rsquo;s the following statement:
&ldquo;Bembo Std family is designed to be used at a text size of 8.0 points&rdquo;
So, is it a problem if I set size to 11pt ?</p>
<p>I also have a little problem with kerning (I&rsquo;m using InDesign).
I set &ldquo;Metric&rdquo; in the paragraph style (I read &ldquo;Optical&rdquo; is not the best choice for text ) but the result is not so good.
Especially for the &ldquo;V&rdquo;. The kerning is automatically set to -175 with the result that there&rsquo;s almost no space between the &ldquo;V&rdquo; and previous character. <img src="/images/old-images/kerning_4368.jpg" alt="">
If I set kerning to &ldquo;Optical&rdquo; everything looks better so I&rsquo;m thinking to switch to that but I&rsquo;m curious about this strange behaviour.</p>
<p>Any guess?
Thanks in advance (and forgive my dodgy english!)</p>

<p>Metal fonts could and often did have different designs for the different sizes. When fonts were first made available as photocomp, traditionally, an 8-point master (for footnotes) was made, a 12-point master (for text), and finally,  an 18-point (for display). &ldquo;Master&rdquo; equals the size of the design with the metal fonts.</p>
<p>Generally, these were &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; successful. The people making up the photocomp fonts usually didn&rsquo;t have the skill, or maybe time, to get the thick-thin proportions of the metal fonts, when printed with the paper of the time, into the photocomp environment. As a result, one size was often more successful than the others, and occasionally, the 8-point &ldquo;master&rdquo; became the preferred version. It could be more than just the technical success of the rendering, of course, Magazines were coming along, and the design of a &ldquo;footnote&rdquo; font more closely matched the perceived needs of magazines than text fonts.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, the 8-point master became the preferred one for Bembo in photocomp, and the only one originally offered in PostScript (for Bembo &ldquo;Standard&rdquo;). You don&rsquo;t think they redid anything, do you? Not for PostScript, and not for OpenType.</p>
<p>However, it is still terrible. If you want to use Bembo for text, you should be using the newer Bembo Book. Why do they still sell the Standard? Well, a fool and his money are soon parted; if you&rsquo;ll buy it, better they get your money than someone else, eh? And the &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; is still marginally useful for display settings, even though it is an 8-point design.</p>
<p>Nice font in metal. Rushed to market in Photocomp (and PostScript). Happened to a lot of the fonts popular in the metal era. Your money, your choice.</p>
<p>As to the kerning. Yes. A part of setting type. That&rsquo;s what typesetters are for. You need to learn how to do that. We&rsquo;re still not to the point where you can simply dump a text into a machine and wonderful stuff pops out. Probably never will be, unless we standardizes everything &ndash; type size, measure, margins, on &amp; on. Most of what a typesetter does is to try &amp; pick the best compromise.</p>
<p>Kerning isn&rsquo;t a compromise? It falls between letter pairs, with no eye to the letters on the other side of that pair. Example: Kern WAVE by hand. For drama, use a setting size of 18 points. Now use the same value for WA that you used in WAVE, but set WARE. In 14-point. As Alan Greenspan was heard to say, &ldquo;oops!&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">When Bembo was digitized 20+ years ago, it was the fashion to kern fonts aggressively. 
Hence the closing up between the “space” and “V” characters.
But problems emerged with this approach, and I don’t think too many foundries do it any more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, thank you Charles for your in depth answer and the quick history lesson. Didn&rsquo;t know the story (I should have pointed out that designing books is not my cup of tea so I realize I made some noob questions).
I will experiment with similar fonts and I&rsquo;ll maybe switch to Bembo Book if it&rsquo;s affordable.
Thanks also to Nick for pointing out this detail, I was in fact quite puzzled seeing that kerning value with no reason, so to say.</p>
<p>I still have a lot to learn here.</p>

<p>Me too, and I&rsquo;ve been at it over 30 years.</p>
<p>While not an answer based on exhaustive searching (I don&rsquo;t know, for example, what ShinnType offers in a Venetian revivalist mode), take a look at Espinosa Nova.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/</a></p>
<p>It appears the roman is still free and the italic $50; you can go a long way with them. To go beyond is essentially the full $400 package, perhaps a bit pricy for a beginner, but we in fact have the entire offering, so I&rsquo;m familiar with it. Both my company and my wife&rsquo;s have set several books with the fonts; they worked well.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a modernization of the work of a Spanish priest in the New World. Call it an oldface if you want, but to my eye, the influences are more Venetian than French.</p>
<p>And Christóbal Henestrosa took the pains to test the fonts with high-resolution offset printing as well as laser printing before publishing them, an important but usually overlooked step.</p>
<p>The thing that attracted me in the first place was the EULA &ndash; Christóbal allows the end user to modify the fonts, without prior permission, though he does ask to be notified if/when modification work is done.</p>
<p>Not to say they are bad as published. The x-height is a little taller than with Bembo, but that is in keeping with a 2013 fashion. I think they still need a little more weight, but unlike with Bembo, that is at least arguable. A couple of the characters need work, to my eye, perhaps not to yours.</p>
<p>All in all, if Bembo (Standard) is an appropriate choice for your book, Espinosa Nova will be better. Whether it is better than Bembo Book, I can&rsquo;t really say. At $50 for the roman and italic, it is certainly cheaper.</p>

<p>Hmm. Garamonds seem popular. We get in a number of books specified in Adobe Garamond Premier &ndash; you know, the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; version of Adobe Garamond.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found French typefaces like French cars. &ldquo;Interesting, very Interesting,&rdquo; spoken in your best Arte Johnson voice. Take the Citroën. Now maybe if I were being chauffeured around, I&rsquo;d think it delightful. But not as a driver. I&rsquo;d prefer an Italian car. And I prefer Italian type, too, when I&rsquo;m driving&hellip;</p>
<p>If Bembo is just too tutu, There is always John Downer&rsquo;s Iowan Old Style. Great big honking x-height, and with a little work, wonderful character fit. A little light for text, but they all are, to my eye, so maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. Intermediate on the x-height is Espinosa Nova.</p>
<p>Having said all that do you care to show it? (&amp; allowing that &ldquo;Garalde&rdquo; can have a lot of different visual interpretations - are you using the term to mean &ldquo;between humanist &amp; modern&rdquo;?)  If you can post a link where I can see it, I&rsquo;d like to take a look. Esp. if it&rsquo;s flavor is more Manutius than Garamond.</p>
<p>If you were too true to letterpress &amp; wetted paper, it will likely be of no use to us modern folk &ndash; e.g., offset printing on Glatfelter 55 uncoated papers. But if you&rsquo;ve reinterpreted it a certain way, it might be interesting, esp to those in scholarly publishing who don&rsquo;t favor the currently fashionable &ldquo;chunky&rdquo; letterforms.</p>

<p>Well&hellip; I doubt it&rsquo;s ready for prime time, and the italic is a bit French, but at least it&rsquo;s easy to read. I went more for a vibe and what pleases me than for specific details, so there are some anachronisms. You can see the original at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/107005">http://typophile.com/node/107005</a> along with the current revision.

<p>As for optical vs. metrics kerning, use whatever works best, and don&rsquo;t sweat it. Your font simply has a kerning table that is optimized for a given point size (or, if you aren&rsquo;t charitable, it has a bad kerning table), and InDesign&rsquo;s algorithm does a better job. If the result looks good, it <em>is </em>good. If you want to, you can tweak the kerning yourself, but that takes a lot of work and your font license might not permit doing so.</p>

<p>I think you should press on, but that&rsquo;s more encouragement than interest. My <em>interest</em> remains with a closer following of the  Manutius/Griffo tradition. I have no idea why.</p>
