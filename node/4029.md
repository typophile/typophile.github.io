    TARGET="_blank"> FF Dax</A> was designed in the mid-nineties by Hans Reichel who
    created <A HREF="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90042.html" TARGET="_blank">
    Barmeno</A> for Berthold in 1983. And you can&#39;t but notice the similarities
    with his <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=719" TARGET="_blank">
    FF Schmalhans</A> too. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hans Reichel &#40;born 1949&#41; is a musician/inventor/composer
    as well as being a type designer. For 20 years he&#39;s made a name for himself
    as an accomplished acoustic and electric guitar player. He&#39;s also the inventor
    of the Daxophon &#40;sic&#41;, an instrument where thin strips of wood are played
    with a bow to mimic animal sounds and human voices.&#34; <BR> <BR>More information
    on his musical endeavors can be found <A HREF="http://www.shef.ac.uk/misc/rec/ps/efi/"
    TARGET="_blank"> here</A>. <BR> <BR>FF Dax was his first release under the FontFont
    banner. Reichel also redesigned and expanded his popular Barmeno family for FontFont,
    but had to change the name to <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=2665"
    TARGET="_blank"> FF Sari</A> to avoid being sued by the new owners of the Berthold
    Type library. <BR> <BR>Which in short means he doesn&#39;t own his creation anymore.
    Go figure.'
