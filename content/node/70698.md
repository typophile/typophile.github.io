  outside thoughts. \r\n\r\nI started off wanting to do something futuristic but classy,
  but may have strayed from that a bit, which is probably for the best. I see this
  as more of a headline font, especially in this weight, shooting for sizes 18+. Eventually,
  I might try to get the lighter weights to work in smaller sizes. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  would be greatly appreciated. I think what I'm struggling with most is the widths
  and proportions of the caps. The semi-double-story g will have to be an alternate,
  if included at all. \r\n\r\nNo kerning yet, by the way.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saloscreen_3615.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/saloscreen2_4638.png]"

  body: "This looks very nice!\r\nI think widening the glyphs a bit to let a little
    more white into those narrow counters might be good to try (unless narrowness
    is a priority purpose of this font). The counters look cramped, and consequently
    the whiteness of letters like /C/, /c/ and /r/ may jump out.\r\n/W/ looks exceedingly
    wide; /T/ and /L/ might be a bit too wide too. Maybe /S/ too, which also leans
    backwards a bit, like /s/.\r\nI like the /t/, and the shape of the lowercase ascenders.
    That's a nice /h/!"

  body: Thanks Craig. I think you may be right about the narrowness. It is making
    some ugly gaps. I was trying to keep it slightly condensed as a design constraint,
    as well as to keep it from getting unwieldy at larger sizes. But perhaps it would
    be good to open it up a bit.

    (But still a lot different.)

  body: "<em>did you try not starting with meta outlines mate hahahaha!</em>\r\nDamn,
    wish I would have started with meta. Would have saved a ton of time. \r\n\r\nSeriously
    though, I'm certainly not going to deny that I find Spiekermann's work inspiring,
    but I did not copy any outlines, and would not ever intentionally rip off any
    design. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, here's the M with the vertex going to the baseline, and
    a few more tweaks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/M2_5401.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otheralts_6033.png]"

    the M at 2 (not the gray one)\r\n- I think the black \"a\" is better\r\n- Same
    for the \"g\"\r\n- Gray \"S\" is somewhat too fat and quirky. Black one is better,
    but the middle piece is a little too high compared with the black \"s\".\r\n-
    I'd prefer an alternate t with a complete stem at both sides.\r\n\r\nKeep up the
    good work! :D"

  body: "Hey Travis,\r\n\r\ndon\u2019t wanna be a killjoy but when I saw this, my
    first thought was these are FF Unit outlines, slightly blended with those of another
    font, e.g. Meta (Condensed) and adjusted in details.\r\nThe reason for my \u2018suspicion\u2019
    might be the fact that there are a lot of \u2018newbie\u2019 fonts out there these
    days that share significant similarities with existing fonts, mainly differing
    in some \u2018unusual\u2019 characters or in details (most often at the end of
    strokes, since this is the quickest way to change the overall appearance of a
    font).\r\nOn the other hand, if you did this from scratch you could take my comment
    as a hint that your font might look too similar to an existing one.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nJ."
