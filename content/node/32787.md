  off the top of my head is Nasalization, but this one is almost entirely angular.  I
  did some forums searches, but almost everything relating to NASA is harsh critiques
  of the "meatball."  :)  Thanks for taking time out of your day to help.  '

    body: Anything close is fine - I don't mind modifying it by hand, just starting
      from scratch.  Thanks!

    body: I agree with you, Stephen, but I'm matching existing marketing materials
      and the customer is not looking for a total rebranding at this time.  I appreciate
      the suggestions.  Looks like this is going to be a re-creation heavy affair.

    their options.
