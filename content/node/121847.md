body: I just finished two typefaces of 3 fonts each but for some reason in Illustrator
  it only shows the regular weights. When I select Light or Bold, all text disappears.
  In InDesign everything works as it should. I believe I actually experienced this
  before and if so, the problem might go away on its own. However, I'm wondering what
  this could be. Do any of you have experience with an error like this?
