    \r\n>I\u2019m not sure who Benson is or if he sourced Optima in his design.\r\n\r\nHuh?
    According to Hermann Zapf where and when? In Linotype's brochure for Optima nova,
    there is a photo of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial lettering, because it is done
    in Optima. For the same reason, in at least one of Hermann Zapf's books, a picture
    of a rubbing from the wall appears as well.\r\n\r\nYou should know who John Benson
    is\u2026 aside from being a type designer in his own right, he ran the John Stevens
    Shop in Newport, RI for decades, and undertook a number of prominent lettering
    commissions in Washington, DC (and elsewhere). His son Nick runs the business
    now as far as I know. I'm sure that David Berlow could fill in more details.\r\n\r\nThe
    story that I had been told was that Maya Lin spoke with him about the lettering.
    It would have been too labor intensive to letter all of those names by hand, so
    a typeface was used instead. Apparently, Benson suggested Optima to her, and it
    was used."

    are going, and it may have been a ploy to distance themselves from the wall while
    sticking to a \"similar/familial\" face (screen resolution is not so good).\r\n\r\nThe

    issue of who owns all caps Optima lists. This is VERY clearly a take off on the
    Memorial. Anyone who thinks otherwise has not seen it. I am as fond as anyone
    of the visual pun but this is just insulting and in very bad taste. I hated the
    war then, I hate the war now, I hated being there and seeing a country being strangled
    by bloodshed there while another country, mine, was being strangled by lies and
    losses of its own. Whatever you think of that time in our history, the people
    who died there needlessly deserve better than this mockery. \r\nImagine if Bloomingdales's
    or Macy's in New York would place posters in the New York subways depicting people
    jumping out of windows of the WTC holding signs with the names of the various
    department store locations? This isn't just a coincidental use of Optima, it is
    done on purpose. I can't imagine the conversation at the presentation of those
    ads to the client. Sick bastards!\r\n\r\nLike Dan said above, everybody who lives
    around here knows damn well what that is!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I think the highly reflective surface of the wall has more to do with its
    identity than anything else. Reverse any sans serif list in all caps out of black
    and put a high gloss over it and people will make that connection. The rose and
    other nondescript reflections really just put the nail in the coffin of at least
    a few peoples' jobs.
