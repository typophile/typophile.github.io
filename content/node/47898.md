body: "I'm working on a poster for a party.. The idea is \"Tacky Holly Golightly.\"
  Pink champagne/Cigarette holders/Virginia Slims/Bubblegum cigarettes will be given
  out at the party.\r\n\r\nI used Candy Script and really felt good about it, but
  this is the response I got: \"The 'champagne Jam' typeface isnt blowing\r\nme away...
  Blingy and bubbilicous. The font should give me the feeling of girlies with luscious
  lipstick drinking tacky pink drinks by the pool in too-short shorts.\"\r\n\r\nNow..
  that's the feel I am getting from the Candy Script. Granted, when I think \"tacky
  type\" I think Curlz and Eurostile. I've never had to make something look both good
  and \"tacky\" before so I would *highly* appreciate some suggestions from you guys
  to help get me out of this box!\r\n\r\nAw heck, I'll post the image so you can see
  the context I'm working with:\r\n\r\n[[http://img142.imageshack.us/my.php?image=birdsaug9id2.gif|Champagne

    specific one, but I wanted to give you my impression anyway.\r\n\r\nTo me the
    font is too thick and bulky. The capital \"C\" and \"J\" are just too clumsy.
    I think a more delicate, slightly more refined font would better suit your needs.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps in some way."

  body: "Please read my post, as \"refined\" is really quite the opposite of what
    I need.  In my mind, a failed attempt at refinement is the very definition of
    tacky, but this leaves me at a loss as far as typeface options to consider. Besides,
    you know.. Papyrus.\r\n\r\nCandy Script, to me, at least had both playfulness
    and a suggestion of elegance combined."

    have said . . . more girly.\r\n\r\nHere are two that perhaps illustrate what I
    mean better:\r\n\r\nFeel Script: http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/91\r\n\r\nBuffet
    Script: http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/27\r\n\r\n\r\n*Edit* Oh, and NO PAPYRUS."
