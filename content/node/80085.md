  anybody have some suggestions on what to see (graphic design, studios, museums,
  typography etc).\r\nWe would also like to visit a printing company, and I would
  be really grateful , if somebody could come up with a few names for me. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I'd suggest the Victoria and Albert Museum in South Kensington. Although
    there isn't a lot that is a concentrated collection of just graphic design there
    are lots of great examples of it amongst other good design in the modern galleries.
    I love the fashion collection and the S.E.Asian collections. 19th Century plaster
    casts of the Trajan Column and similar monuments displayed in a 19th Century manner.
    Lovely building. Good bookshop and gift shop. It's free although there are some
    exhibitions that have an entrance fee.\r\nhttp://www.vam.ac.uk/\r\n\r\nThere's
    a Wim Crouwel exhibition at the Design Museum while you're here.\r\nhttp://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2011/wim-crouwel"

  body: I'm sure there are many design studios in London, but one that pops into my
    mind is the London office of Pentagram (pentagram.com), a famous international
    graphic design group. Obviously you'd need to contact them ahead of time to see
    if they'd have time to talk to your students.

    and ads on vehicles.\r\nAnd of course the famous Underground map.\r\n"

    inspired by the breathtaking antiquities collections in the Britisch Museum.\r\nAnd
    if some pounds are left, embark on the \u201CLondon Eye\u201D. It\u2019s worth
    the money.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/London_4_BM_9_kl_6142.jpg]\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/London_1_Westm_1_kl_4397.jpg]"

  body: Check out what exhibitions are on at the British Library during your visit.
    The permanent exhibit of books and manuscripts is always worth a visit, and there
    are often interesting temporary exhibits.

  body: "Head to Brick Lane and up towards Old Street (East End) for graffiti and
    street art...don't venture too far off the beaten track though...ride any of the
    overground trains around the south and you'll see some pieces on the warehouses
    and retaining walls.\r\n\r\nThe Cemeteries near [[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&rls=en&oe=UTF-8&redir_esc=&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=st+pancras+cemetery&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=st+pancras+cemetery&hnear=London+N12&cid=0,0,9397200359882542634&ei=1X6GTZWZH86ChQfPn_27BA&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&resnum=2&ved=0CB4QnwIwAQ|Highgate]]
    might offer some rewards too.\r\n\r\n@1985 - good call. Always be looking up,
    the commercial signage for Chicken Cottage et al is a feature in itself.\r\n\r\nI'd
    split them into groups, it's a big ass city to cover.\r\n"
