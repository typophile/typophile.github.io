  and I\u2019m having trouble finding good photos of the guys. Everything I have is
  scanned from design magazines, but the dot screen in those magazines is giving me
  the most horrible moire patterns I\u2019ve ever had to deal with. Does anyone have
  some good photos of Jonathan and Tobias from conventions?"

    I know there's a forthcoming Blu-Ray edition, so the resolution will be really
    great. You could try e-mailing Gary Hustwit about using them.

    who work with them. Talk to Sara Soskolne, for instance. Maybe she has some nice
    candids. Didn't Jared Benson intern at HTF (as it was known then)? \r\n\r\nWhen
    David Berlow was awarded the SoTA award at last year's TypeCon, Sam had a hilarious
    photo of Jonathan from the early days -- long, curly, wild-man hair. I'll bet
    FB has photos of Tobias as well. I don't know if they'll feel comfortable giving
    them without permission from the subjects, however.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    into one of those now-you\u2019re-a-big-design-student publication projects and
    I\u2019m just going for quality and variety. I know how photo-happy some Typophiles
    are, but Flicker wasn\u2019t turning up much, and I was just hoping to find some
    solid photos that looked a little casual. "
