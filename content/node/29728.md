  Font Explorer for Mac.  I don't recall which version it was, though.  I've been
  getting messages to upgrade to version 1.1.  I'm quite happy with 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know if 1.1 is working fine or has any nasty bugs?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I rarely run into issues with FEX 1.1. Occasionally the Indesign plugin will
    beachball and claims to be activating fonts when opening documents,  clicking
    cancel gets it to proceed without any trouble. The only other times FEX causes
    me trouble are when the memory leaks in Firefox start piling up and I start to
    run really low on RAM, but at this point I'm about to switch to Safari and fix
    all of my Firefox issues for good.\r\n\r\nRegardless of these little things, it's
    still about a million times better than any version of Suitcase I ever used."
