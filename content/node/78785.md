body: "Hey guys, I'm relatively new to the realms of Typophile and graphic design,
  in about 15 days I begin my Bachelor of Design,\r\n\r\nMy father, brother and I
  are partners of this company and I, due to my chosen career path, was tasked with
  assembling an identity.\r\nThe business is called China CV, I wasn't allowed to
  play with the name, its a online service that in 24 hours, using real people who
  can read/write both English & Chinese, translates your resume & other professional
  documents from English to Chinese.\r\n\r\nThis is what I've come up with - \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4236.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface is up for discussion, I used Lato because it is using a Free-Font License
  (as far as I'm aware this included commercial ventures but if i'm in the wrong I'd
  love if someone gave me the heads up?).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chinacv_5421.png]\r\n\r\nI
  based it on Chinese coin designs that were used for centuries, in hindsight it kind've
  looks like a bank, which isn't a bad thing necessarily as we are involved in e-commerce,
  which is renowned for 'dodgeyness'. \r\n\r\nTell me what you think!\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nchillphilli"

  body: "It's nice, I like the simplicity. A couple of suggestions:\r\n\u2022 The
    logo could do with some optical correction. Inner square should be slightly lighter
    than the outer circle as curves need more weight to look balanced. Horizontal
    lines of the box should be thinned slightly in relation to the verticals to look
    the same weight.\r\n\u2022 Due to the interaction between the circle and the square,
    you should make the circle slightly superelliptical (pull out the bcps slightly
    away from the nodes). That way you'll avoid the optical illusion that the circle
    is slightly diamond shaped.\r\n\u2022 Check the spacing around the logo. I'd suggest
    it should be about the same as the space between letters. Unfortunately with the
    shapes of the A and C surrounding the logo, you'll still end up with white triangles
    next to the circle. However, this can easily be put to use and solved by moving
    the logo upwards from the baseline."

  body: "I too like it (maybe not that fond of the purple ;-)\r\nIt has something
    of a bank about it, but the type counterbalance that.\r\nHave you tried rotating
    the logo 45\xB0? (in doing so you could subliminally refer to CV without actually
    \u201Cplaying with the name\u201D)"

  body: Good comments above.  The only thing I would add is that putting the symbol
    between CHINA and CV is not really working to me.  It reads too much like a wannabe
    letterform, and breaks up the readability of the name.  How about a more traditional
    layout with the text below the symbol?  Or an option with the text to the right
    of the symbol?

  body: "I didn't get the coin at all, even though I've routinely used similar coins
    in the past. I think this was primarily due to square stroke being of the same
    weight as a circle. So, to echo Bendy's first suggestion - make it lighter, and
    not just slightly. \r\n\r\nSecondly, it may be worth noting that I keep seeing
    a pair of Playstation control buttons, one in another. Reducing the stroke weight
    will help getting rid of this association.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would have a look
    at typefaces that have circle(-ish) capital C, e.g. like that in Proxima Nova
    or Gotham. This should help tying the type to the mark."

  body: Agree about Gotham, that would go very well with the logo. But for me at least
    it is very much part of this decade's zeitgeist, which may or may not be a good
    thing.

    some more options and bring them to the next meeting, Gotham is indeed a good

    some Chinese folks, too, as graphics can sometimes have different meanings & associations
