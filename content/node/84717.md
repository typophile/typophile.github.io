body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for opinions/suggestions about the following
  issue :\r\n\r\nI've been teaching on and off recently in graphic design in the college
  where I used to study 10 years ago. This semester I'm giving an introduction to
  type class and from what I can see, the college still has all the same fonts than
  when I was a student (and who knows how long they've had them before that). No Officina,
  no DIN, no Gotham, nothing even Opentype I fear but I need to confirm that. Fortunately,
  we have a lot of classics but nothing so contemporary. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
  we are updated our Adobe suites yearly (or as they come out should I say!). \r\n\r\nI'm
  afraid we are helping them become good technicians more than giving them the tools
  to produce a portfolio that will help them land a job later or get them into university
  (we tend to do 3 years of graphic design in college here, followed by another 3
  years in a BA, but the BA is difficult to get into).\r\n\r\nOther than fontsquirrel.com,
  which I guess would be ok for institutional use since it's ok for commercial, I'm
  not sure if I have many other options than raise the issue with convincing arguments
  so the department will think it's an investment and not lots of money going out
  the window.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on the issue typophiles?\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your time,\r\nEmilie "

    of the need and have support by other staff as well. If they can see a worthwhile
    benefit from the expenditure they are more likely take it seriously.

    most schools do not have many fonts outside the Adobe educational options is that
    there is very little else available at prices schools can afford. Aside from Adobe,
    Sumner Stone is the only type designer I know of who offers fonts to schools at
    prices most can afford. When schools have to choose between computers or fonts,
    the computers come first.\r\n\r\nAnd serious students manage to acquire the fonts
    they want to use in their work without the school doing it for them."

    Officina look outdated to me. The others, just overused. Honestly: an up-to-date
    Adobe catalog sounds like an excellent foundation to build upon. Didn''t someone
    here once suggest requiring each student to spend a set amount of money on fonts
    as part of the course? I like that idea.'

  body: Requiring students to pay for fonts seems like a good idea, and might work
    in some countries. But here in the USA tuition prices are exploding and even part-time
    jobs can be hard to find. I get students who can barely afford textbooks, they
    do not have money for fonts, no matter how many times cranky old designers quote
    statistics about what students spend on beer.

    font piracy. The students see all these fonts out there that they want to use
    but lack the funds to purchase them. \r\n\r\nIt's much easier for them to download
    a torrent of 10,000 fonts than to save for 1 typeface.\r\n\r\nIn a way, when students
    use these pirated fonts, it slightly undermines any sort of ethics in design and
    can potentially lead to problems in the future (as we have seen recently (Harry
    Potter & P22 is one example of many)). \r\n\r\nHowever, the limitation in choice
    can help the students as it prevents them from always having the right font for
    every project (therefore making them work with what they have and not allowing
    them to \"take the easy way out\")."

    had on a student's budget.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere is, but design teachers and designers
    hiring students need to consider realistic student budgets. Many students can
    afford to buy fonts from ExLjibris, especially on a per-font basis. Far fewer
    can afford to buy a complete family from H&FJ, or even the Canada Type value packs.
    There is too much pressure on students to purchase the same high-end type that
    professionals use. Expecting a design major to buy Font Folio Education Essentials
    for $150 is reasonable. Expecting a design major to spend $200 on a four-weight
    family from a foundry that does not offer student discounts is not reasonable."

  body: "<cite>I have found that I learned more through working with poor fonts than
    ones that look fantastic out of the box.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat should give me some
    food for thought. What do you feel you've learned better working with poor fonts?
    Or is it that when you finally got to work with a good font, you were use to work
    hard to make it look good so it was easier? Or was it that you had to find the
    good font in a sea of poor fonts?\r\n\r\nI don't think our problem is lack of
    fonts; the font collection is pretty big (not sure it's Adobe's though. Adobe's
    bundles look clean to me compared to what we have). The quality vs. quantity in
    my opinion is poor. Lots of decorative stuff and so-so fonts and many fonts that
    are similar. Especially when students first start, they really get lost into this
    IMO. \r\n\r\n<cite>There's plenty of amazing type out that there that can be had
    on a student's budget.</cite>\r\n\r\nI understand asking students to buy some
    fonts would be reasonable considering it's a tool to create, just like they buy
    markers and rulers and brushes and whatever else we ask. Then again, if their
    own school isn't able to step up to this, I wonder how they would feel about the
    quality of their education? Most of them are on a tight budget. I give evening
    classes so I get older students and it's not as bad in their case but I still
    have to insist that designing a font takes a lot skill and time.\r\n\r\nI actually
    revised the font bank to see what we had in Mr. Shinn's Perfect Set and glad to
    see we actually have Officina and I was wrong (but forget about Cartier, Matrix,
    Scala, Base9 and many others...). \r\n\r\nI've spoken to colleagues about the
    issue and they seem to agree we could use an update but were not so optimistic
    that we would have the money. Then again, I felt as if they had not given much
    time to think about it before I mentionned it. \r\n\r\nThank you for everyone
    who provided links, it might prove useful in a near future.\r\nEmilie\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    in the manual. \r\n\r\nSeriously... My company requires consultants to use an
    OpenType font and to be just a little bit be OpenType savvy. When they learn this,
    they go \"Whaaa...\". \r\n\r\nIt's annoying. Why do I have to explain this stuff
    to them. Have they not been to school... Oh yeah. Apparently schools think computers
    use some kind of digital analog of metal type which was all created in the dark
    ages and has been frozen in aspic ever since. \r\n\r\nPeople like me... I.e. clients,
    need designers who have an understanding of modern typography. I think it's a
    reasonable assumption that they'd get that from some exposure to modern fonts.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@emspace\r\nI would suggest you encourage your students to directly contact
    the font companies whose work they find interesting. No harm in asking for a student
    discount directly. They may or may not get the response they are hoping for, but
    it will reinforce the idea that type designers are people too, that most of us
    want to be helpful, and most of us run small enough operations that can respond
    to personalized requests.\r\n\r\nIn crafting the request, I would suggest that
    your students explain in real design terms, why they are interested in using a
    particular type design. What is the scope of the project and why this particular
    typeface is important to the success of that project. Stating that this or that
    typeface is \"really cool\" or that \"I'm in love with it\" will not cut it."

  body: There's nothing you can do with a bunch of recent vintage fonts that you couldn't
    accomplish with a standard set of Adobe fonts. At least, nothing that a good designer
    couldn't accomplish. But isn't that the point? You're trying to turn them into
    good designers. If you can make something good with a bog standard font, you could
    make it great with a specialized typeface.

  body: "There are two different issues here. Yes, being able to design well with
    a limited set of fonts is important. But, at the same time, students should be
    getting relevant experience - which means learning how to deal with the quirks
    and limitations of today's popular typefaces.\r\n\r\nFor my needs, the font collection
    from Bitstream that is included with various Corel products is wonderful, because
    it includes quality versions of nearly all the classic typefaces I'm interested
    in. For a student today, though, something like that would not be enough.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    learning about the quirks of Lucida, Stone, Gandhi, and similar faces, for example,
    is likely going to be very relevant. Or, as a random example, perhaps Marat, from
    Ludwig Type, depending on how popular it is. Or Bitstream's Charter.\r\n\r\nOr
    FontFont's Ernestine - just <em>one</em> example related to a participant here;
    <em>many</em> others qualify, since faces embodying contemporary design principles
    are useful even if they're not the currently fashionable and overused faces. (One
    of the reasons Gandhi, being free, came to mind earlier.)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
    if some of the struggling smaller font houses might get together and offer some
    kind of deal to colleges... it wouldn't hurt to have a generation of typographers
    growing up with experience with Williams Caslon and Goodchild and Bouwsma Text..."
