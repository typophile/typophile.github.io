  body: Get rid of the 'th', then put a | or a centre dot in between the dates instead
    of the comma.

    want to repeat the bar in the dates, so here's with the centre dots and commas...I
    think the dots looks a bit too decimal so probably going with commas. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dates2_4706.jpg]"

    it be too weird to put \"May\" ahead of the date numbers? Might help the reader
    parse the list of numbers as dates."

  body: Why are the hyphens there, when comma's would do the same? Or am I missing
    something? By the way, maybe it would look better with wider spacing around the
    centre dots.

  body: "Good question. Personally I like the typography of having the dashes, though
    the sense would be the same with commas.\r\n\r\nI guess also having the pairs
    of dates with dashes shows there are some two-day events, rather than a series
    of one-day events. My brain parses that differently somehow."

  body: "Those hyphens look to actually be en-dashes, and is the accepted form for
    indicating an inclusive range of numbers in text (though easily confused with
    a minus sign in a mathematical equation). Or maybe it's supposed to be an em-dash.
    So many things to remember in those style guides; the one I had I gave away many
    years ago.\r\n\r\nBut yes, since the dates shown here are consecutive, the dashes
    seem overkill, unless it's meant to show the event runs overnight or something
    like that."

  body: Bendy uses the en-dashes correctly to signify a range. If you were to use
    the middle-dot I would suggest an en-space on either side instead of the (normal)
    word-space.

    than a normal space \u2014 so that might have contributed to my preferring the
    commas."

  body: 7-8, 14-15, etc. are not ranges, as there are no days between them. Why not
    just use commas for all? 7, 8, 14, 15? This is different from an actual range
    such as 4-15.

    think I still prefer the version with dashes...easier to see there are four periods
    when the exhibition is on, rather than a set of isolated one-day events. Seems
    to me this is an instance to break the rules purposefully."

  body: I prefer the second one from april 22, with only midpoints, or the first one
    from April 21, with midpoints and commas (and hopefully with more space around
    the midpoints). The latter does make it clear that there are four unified events,
    not seven, which may, as you pointed out, be important.

    | Type and Typography]] by Phil Baines.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dashes</strong>\r\n'For
    parenthetical clauses use a dash not a hyphen. En dashes  with a space either
    side are the norm today in Britain and are nearly always better than em dashes
    with sans serif typefaces. Em dashes often look more bookish and tend to work
    better with older typefaces. They should be used without a space either side.'\r\n\r\n'Never
    use hyphens for this role. Hyphens simply indicate broken or compound words. An
    em dash is also used within contracted dates and page numbers, where it is employed
    without a space either side.'\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Dates</strong>\r\n'British style
    is to use cardinal numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and in the following order: 8 December
    1958. US style uses ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) as follows: December
    8th, 1958.'\r\n\r\n\r\nSB\r\n\r\n "
