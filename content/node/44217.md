  target=\"new\">Another (better) link</a>\r\n<cite>\r\nShowing as part of the Medieval
  season. Stephen Fry goes in search of the story behind the inventor of the printing
  press, Johann Gutenberg, travelling across Europe to find out how Gutenberg kept
  his development work secret, and how his approach started a cultural revolution.
  \r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand the man and his machine, Stephen assembles
  a team to help him build a copy of Gutenberg's printing press as well as learning
  how to make the paper and type so that they can print as Gutenberg once did.</cite>"

    just that much less mind-rotting than ours?

    advertising to accompany 'Mad Men' which it also airs. So you get the idea...\r\n"

    your link points at, is that it shows a technique that appears to be the way  Gutemberg
    printed his bibles, in a way that each spread with 2 or 4 pages was actually printed
    (pressed) one page at a time. I will certainly look for this documentary. Thanks
    for the link.\r\n\r\n\xA1 awesome !"

    be entirely dismissed as beyond the pale, gentility-wise. In Stephen Fry and the
    Machine That Made Us, he was at his most engaging, presenting with intelligent
    wit the story of the man who invented the printing press almost 600 years ago
    \u2013 Johannes Gutenberg from Mainz on the banks of the Rhine , \"the silicon
    valley of medieval Europe\".\""
