body: I am in need of a delicate script font, something very feminine and light, for
  use in various promo materials for my wedding photography business.  I really like
  windsong (http://www.dafont.com/windsong.font), but the loopy lowercase d drives
  me insane, especially since "wedding" requires it to be doubled up, which just looks
  tacky and wrong.  I have tried modifying the more subtle lowercase b, but without
  much luck.  Any suggestions for a similar look?
