  predecessor suffered from FFFS (fondness for free fonts syndrome). It's a low-budget
  project, but the client is insisting on an exact match. My former colleague is out
  of the country and I'm up the proverbial creek.\r\nYour suggestions will be welcomed
  with open arms (and a modest donation to Typophile).\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/stimac_sans_3834.gif]"
