body: "Hi all, I'm working on a logo and looking for a font with a really small x-height.
  I started off with Bliss, but \u2013 concerns just one Dutch word in SC \u2013 it's
  too dominant. Which is a pity, I like Bliss. \r\nSo it has to be a sans, otherwise
  I would have chosen Mrs Eaves Petit Caps, or something similar.\r\n \r\nAnybody
  got any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, Brieck."

    will be seeing a Little Johnny Eaves and a Little Janie Eaves, adding a slab and
    a script to the collection.\r\n\r\n(Just kidding, in case anyone out there still
    takes me seriously.)\r\n"

  body: If you really like Bliss--I'm a fan as well--you could try just using a smaller
    point size on the small caps, or else going to the next heavier weight and shrinking
    that down. It might work.
