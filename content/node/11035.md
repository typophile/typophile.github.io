body: 'hi, <BR>thrugh my search for info on lucas de groot&#39;s fonts i run across
  some terms that i am not familiar with, like: <BR>expert glyphs <BR>hanging monospaced/proportional
  figure <BR>lining monospaced/proportional figure <BR>fraction figure <BR>f-ligatture
  <BR>i guess that some of those terms are really basics, and might be that it is
  just the difference between designing in hebrew or latin typeface. so if anybody
  have an idea about where i can find this info, i&#39;ll be thaxfull! <BR>roy <BR>

  body: <b>glyph:</b> A character&#39;s form or shape in a font.  <BR><b>expert glyphs:</b>
    This may not be correct usage. The usual term would be expert characters. It means
    characters intended for use in more refined typesetting, such as small caps and
    ligatures &#40;see below&#41;.  <BR><b>hanging figures:</b> Number characters
    which sometimes hang below the baseline. Also called old style, ranging, or lowercase
    figures.  <BR><b>lining figures:</b> number characters which are all the same
    height  <BR><b>monospaced:</b> All the same width &#40;as on a typewriter&#41;.
    Monospaced figures are designed to line up neatly in tables or colums of figures.   <BR><b>proportional:</b>
    Varying widths. Proportional figures are designed to look better in headlines
    and text.   <BR>&#40;Usually, figures are monospaced, whether hanging or not.
    de Groot is saying he also provides proportional sets of both styles.&#41;  <BR><b>fraction
    figures:</b> A set of small number characters, both superior and inferior, for
    creating arbitrary fractions &#40;e.g. 13/457&#41;. A special fraction bar character
    is used with these. An example of something which would be part of an expert character
    set.  <BR><b>f-ligature:</b> A ligature is a pair of characters combined into
    one character, usually to solve awkward spacing problems, but sometimes decorative.
    An f-ligature would combine f with some other character &#40;fi, fl, ff, ffi,
    ffl, are typical&#41;. f-ligatures are the most common kind of ligatures. The
    top of the f in many typefaces extends far enough to the right that it can cause
    problems when setting next to certain other characters &#40;mainly i and l&#41;.
    Ligatures are designed to solve this type of problem.

  body: 'Regarding glyphs and characters: <BR> <BR>A character is an encoded semantic
    entity, e.g. &#39;Latin uppercase A&#39; encoded in Unicode as U&#43;0041. <BR>
    <BR>A glyph is a particular representation of a character, multiple characters
    &#40;ligature&#41;, or even part of a character. A font is a collection of glyphs,
    some or all of which may be directly mapped to characters. It is possible for
    a font to include &#39;unencoded glyphs&#39;, <i>i.e.</i> glyphs that are not
    directly mapped to characters, but only indirectly mapped via glyph lookups. So,
    for example, a regular uppercase A, a smallcap A, and a swash A are all glyph
    representations of the character &#39;Latin uppercase A&#39;, but only one of
    them will be directly mapped to the character codepoint U&#43;0041. The others
    may be called &#39;expert glyphs&#39;, but the more usual term is &#39;variant
    glyphs&#39;.'
