Now Adobe sent me a promo offering the Photoshop upgrade for $169 but I could buy the complete Suite with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and GoLive for $749. Since I have the most recent versions of all those programs I did the math. Buying the individual upgrades for each program came out to $676 or $73 cheaper than buying the suite.

I just think they should have given the same price for the suite as the upgrade per product. In my case they will have to send me 4 products separately (free shipping) rather than one product one time. I understand it was a promotional price but if its worth over a $1000 and your discounting to $749 why not discount it to $676 the cost of upgrades of the 4 products each?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. Well, it certainly is getting a lot of attention.  <BR> <BR>So, does anybody have a problem with the $169 individual application upgrade price? No? <BR> <BR>So, what's bugging people is that the all-in-one upgrade to the suite for Photoshop users is a little more expensive than doing individual upgrades, IF you already own all the individual applications? Right? <BR> <BR>So, DON'T buy the suite upgrade if you already have all the individual apps! What's the big deal? <BR> <BR>Also, remember that not everyone already has all the Adobe apps. For those who use other apps (or no apps) in one or more categories, the suite upgrade from Photoshop looks a lot more attractive. <BR> <BR>By the way, there are a couple of things that come in the suite that don't come separately: <BR>- Version Cue <BR>- several weights of Brioso Pro and Warnock Pro <BR>- a Total Training CD (I admit I don't even know what that is!) <BR> <BR>However, one certainly should balance that against the lack of printed manuals (which DO come with the individual apps). <BR> <BR>It's understandable that people are unhappy with the *relative* prices, but I think it's worth noting that these are pretty reasonable rates in *absolute* terms, or compared to the competition. Look at what Quark does for upgrades&hellip;. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Craig: The software industry has always been based around licenses. They're just doing a better job of educating consumers about it. <BR> <BR>I agree that in general font bundling depresses the demand for fonts. There's no question about that. There's a reasonable argument to be made that it either directly or indirectly depresses the customers' valuation of fonts. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I'll also note that the general trend for Adobe has been to bundle fewer and fewer fonts. Back when I started at Adobe there were individual products that bundled 220-350 fonts EACH. So the current system where you can buy ALL the individual products and only end up with 138 bundled fonts, or 212 if you buy the suite, is a significant improvement. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, I think a Trial-Software would be good. I'm, however, completely opposed to anything even closely resembling copy-control-technology (like Fontwise) or Activations-stuff, anything that pre-criminalizes the User and makes Font-Usage complicated. Let's not repeat the error of the music-industry. The best way to sell fonts is to make the public aware of nice typefaces and their importance, to make buying them as eay as possible, and to make friends out of customers. I'd never ever steal a font from, say, Luc(as), because I know that this is at least )in my case, a small) part of what he lives from. You don't steal from folks you like.  <BR> <BR>BEn, I think dismissing the printed manuals is a BRILLIANT idea, ecologically speaking. I've been throwing away this s*** for years, never ever needed them. The help function and a PDF are absolutely enough. and even more practical. Let's keep more trees alive&hellip;</div>

They provide an okay service, at least via the forums (alas not via phone, but no company really does these days), they manage to actually still improve their products with most updates (Photoshop 7 and InDesign 2 being great examples), they still come up with revolutionary new techniques like OTF&hellip;  <BR> <BR>It's just that CS is a very sure sign that Adobe is adopting some bad marketing policies.
