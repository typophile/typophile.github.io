  and bold for an ebook. The Author at this stage is not yet sure whether the book
  will be sold in the apple store but there is a good chance it will be. \r\n\r\nI
  have the fonts on my mac because they came with software and I will now purchase
  them, but can they be used for the ebook? I really hope so. I can officially purchase
  them here - http://www.fonts.com/search/all-fonts?searchtext=Calibri&SearchIn=all-fonts#product_top\r\n\r\n...
  but do I need to since they came with office products and even if I do purchase
  them, will that allow me to use them in the ebook? I believe the fonts are packaged
  when the fixed layout epub is created using CC Indesign 2014 meaning if the epub
  was taken apart by someone, they could potentially install the fonts, which I believe
  is a no no (despite them being available for free on the internet). \r\n\r\nHoping
  someone knows the answer or can point me in the right direction. We need to publish
  in 2 or so days!! HELP. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nKat. "

    </cite>\r\n\r\nA \u201Cnormal\u201D license is usually a desktop license, which
    only allows the installation on a fixed number of local devices. It doesn\u2019t
    cover any uses which \u201Cdistribute\u201D the font to other users. There are
    special licenses for that: web license, app license, ebook/epub license, OEM license. "

    uses?\r\n\r\nFirst things first:\r\n- What's the book about?\r\n- How long is
    it?\r\n- What kind(s) of illustrations?\r\n\r\nBTW Riccardo, that book looks like
    a must!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
