  body: According to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721/">its
    MyFonts page</a>, Swiss 721 was designed by Max Miedinger, and its letterform
    design is based on Helvetica.

    other. Swiss 721 has a narrower M and R and a taller bowl on the g. The e and
    c seem to have slightly flatter sides too.\r\nHelios? No."

    for that, Stephen. I wasn't too sure about their statement myself, and interpreted
    it as a sheepish acknowledgement that Swiss 721 owes a lot to Helvetica."

  body: I worked at some publications back in the Seventies that had Compugraphic
    or AM typesetting equipment in house. Their respective versions of Helvetica--Helios
    and Megaron--were noticeably different, but superficially similar to Helvetica.
    I remember wishing we could afford to send out for type from a shop that had Linotype
    equipment because the knock-offs didn't look quite like the real thing. Another
    common off-brand Helvetica back then was Aphatype's Claro. Compugraphic released
    an exact copy of Helvetica in the early Eighties called Triumvirate. (Now that
    I see the name again, "Megaron" sounds like the name of a Japanese movie monster.)

  body: "I think it's interesting how clones and metrically compatible fonts have
    been effectively \u201Cretired\u201D as foundries have consolidated. From the
    \u201Cold days\u201D what do we have in every-day use? Swiss (as seen in the recent
    Sony eReader) and Arial, and even Arial has been \u2018retired\u2019 as a default
    in Office. On the other hand in the past ten years we\u2019ve seen several new
    fonts based on Arial\u2019s metrics. "

  body: The old clones were mainly a result of the fact that fonts from one manufacturer's
    equipment could not be used in another's. In effect, there is only one kind of
    typesetting machine now, and fonts are for the most part interchangeable. If you
    want to set type in Helvetica, you don't need to by your "typesetting machine"
    from Linotype anymore. You just need to license the font.

  body: "Mark -\r\n\r\nTriumvirate was produced digitally by Agfa Fonts for the Mac
    back (I think) in the early '90s. \r\nAlphatype's Claro - was really, really weak
    as a Helvetica. Our shop loved getting in the Berthold one - and Len Leone Sr.,
    the art director of Bantam Books at that time - really took notice to our Helvetica.
    I think I shared that story here before, so I won't do it again.... but hey, it
    was a good, positive sign for my typeshop... \r\n\r\nAlso, you may remember that
    the Helvetica on film for typositor was also very different from the digitized
    versions for Alphatype, Harris, Compugraphic, Linotype and forgive me for all
    the other typesetting equipment I didn't name that bit the dust.\r\n\r\nOne of
    my favorites was from Castcraft -- Helvetica Advertising. It had lower case the
    same height as upper case - and it was wonderful for ad copy."

  body: "Yes, I remember Triumvirate was released by Agfa (before it joined up with
    Monotype) when they first started selling PostScript Type 1 fonts in the early
    Nineties. It seemed like a strange idea to me at the time. Why would you buy it
    if you could get the real thing?\r\n\r\nThe film headline fonts of Helvetica were
    based on the metal foundry type for display sizes. Most of the current digital
    versions are based on Linotype's machine-set metal version, which were all designed
    for 18-point or smaller. The display sizes in metal were always more elegant and
    refined, no matter what typeface it was. Sadly, most of the digital versions of
    the old standbys are based on text sizes. URW has digital versions of both for
    some faces (designated with a T for text or a D for display), as does Bitstream
    (with the word \"Headline\" in the name). Check out URW's Nimbus Sans D and you
    will see the Helvetica you remember."
