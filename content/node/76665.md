body: "Hi there, i am currently in my third year at university studying graphic design
  and have recently started my dissertation.\r\n\r\nI have decided on an area of which
  i would like to focus on however the subject area has been covered before and continues
  to be discussed in the design industry of late.\r\n\r\nI would like to base my dissertation
  on print and pixel and where the two are heading. However i am really struggling
  on pin pointing one aspect within such a large subject (help?). For me print publishing
  will always appeal to me, the aesthetic value of a well designed publication is
  what print is all about. Its why I love what i do.\r\n\r\nNow i have discussed and
  brainstormed the subject with my tutor. But if anyone can provide me with further
  advice then it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nBen"

    value as a dissertation because it\u2019s just speculation. Find a way to turn
    this dissertation into the development of something concrete instead."
