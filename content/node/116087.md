body: "Hey Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo for a news website. I've attached
  a few examples of the current direction it's heading in. The 'B' stands for buzz,
  eg: ' a hive of information and up-to-date news. The original concept was that the
  'B' could represent a literal Bee and the form of the letter 'C' would represent
  it's wing from a side-on perspective. I wanted this reference to be extremely subtle
  and as far from illustrative as possible so as to avoid it being over the top, in
  your face, or cliche. Whilst the client really likes t, unfortunately the select
  few I've shared this with don't think it works even subtly (the bee concept), but
  they quite like it regardless.\r\n\r\nI'm asking because I want some genuinely expert
  feedback regarding ways I could improve or different directions I could take it.
  Most importantly I want it to be typographically strong and not look amateurish.
  For thirds interested the letters are a heavily edited (bastardised?) Museo.\r\n\r\nAll
  criticism and comments welcome!\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/2qFSpoT.png[/img]"

  body: "I like the third version from the left, although I don't like the black background
    -- that's too limiting for variable use. As for a \"bee\", or by inference a \"hive\"
    concept, it fails totally for me; I just don't make any connection. \r\n\r\nWhen
    I first saw it my immediate reaction was \"citizen's band\", which I think is
    still around. So perhaps you should approach this more from the standpoint of
    news communication which is what it is. CB could fit comfortably within that category,
    I think. It's just a more personalized method of information and/or news dissemination.\r\n\r\nMy
    own personal hive of information is the internet. Everything you might need to
    know can be found there, somewhere."

  body: "I agree. I like the third version and maybe the fourth. Surely the ones where
    the two letters don't touch. I don't think the black background is a problem,
    it will work with black on white background too.\r\nAs for the bee I am sorry
    to say that I would have never guessed it by myself and even now that I know it
    I can't say I really see it there. It does not matter though, number three is
    a very good logo."

  body: "If you're not constrained by the color scheme, you might strengthen the \"Bee\"
    hint by using yellow/black instead of the red? Without your explanation, I wouldn't
    have associated the insect (or relations) with the logo :)\r\n\r\nOther than that,
    yes, third from the left I like best."

  body: "Thanks all for your feedback! I agree the third from the left was the most
    successful - I also agree the 'Bee' concept was a bit of a stretch. I would (and
    did, for experimentation) change the colour from deep reddy orange to a more conventional
    'Bee yellow' but the client is pretty set on what we have so far. \r\n\r\nHe requested
    the whole word 'CoinBuzz' in the same bastardised Museo (yay) so I quickly knocked
    off the curvaceous serifs and was left with the below images. I suggested he could
    use both the full logo and the reduced 'CB' at his leisure depending on any size
    or dimensional constraints.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a1_5039.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a2_5365.png]\r\n\r\nI
    quite like it but lack the veteran eye of a type designer and not sure if my taste
    is failing me. Issues i'm aware of being:\r\n\r\n-The curvature of the 'C' is
    more horseshoe than rounded, almost  awkward (not sure if anyone agrees?)\r\n-The
    square tittle from the 'i' was replaced with a friendlier round one. I made sure
    it didn't ascend too high but matched the width of the i's vertical stroke; not
    sure if it sits nicely or looks 'off'.\r\n-Most importantly, removing the serifs
    from the 'n' and 'u' has reduced their character width somewhat and consequently
    might need to expand them and give them a bit more room to breath. Note the 'o'
    in comparison to the 'n'. \r\n-Kerning needs work?\r\n\r\nWould love to hear others'
    thoughts on my (above) notes - or any other further comments or criticisms. I
    want this to be as polished as possible and ideally to learn from you guys in
    the process. Thanks :)"

    <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-SgdeIg\">Museo Sans</a> ;-) Now you\u2019ve already
    done the work, you can at least go compare if Jos Buivenga did anything differently."

  body: Thanks for this! Yeah I should really have done that although I don't seem
    to have Museo Sans 700, only the lighter weights! But I will definitely compare
    the two when I get the chance.
