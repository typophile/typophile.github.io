body: "This is my first attempt at making a typeface. It is meant to be a rather generic
  looking sans-serif as the main purpose of this is for teaching myself by making
  something. One thing I wanted to have is a clearly differentiated I, l and 1 which
  is the reason behind the l having the curl. I haven't done accents yet, but I want
  to 'finalise' the main letters before I do them so I don't get into a situation
  where I have to change 8 glyphs because of a change in one of the characters.\r\n\r\nIf
  someone with more experienced eyes could take a look and spot things I missed, I
  would be very grateful!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/sample_b.gif\"></img>"

  body: "I like the relationship between the small x-height and the narrow caps (but
    some aren't narrow enough). This could possibly become more than a learning exercise.\r\n\r\nMany
    of your curves are wobbly - look at the \"e\", and the top counter of the \"R\".\r\n\r\nSome
    things:\r\n- The \"Q\", \"g\" and \"s\" are out of character. For the \"g\" you
    might try a Koch form.\r\n- Bottom of the \"s\" is too thick.\r\n- I actually
    like the \"t\" being tall (especially in this modest-x-height design).\r\n- The
    \"x\" and \"z\" are top-heavy.\r\n- The little notch in the \"y\" is too tentative
    - dump it or grow it.\r\n\r\nLast but certainly not least: spacing is a bit tight
    (and uneven).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks everyone for the comments. I'm reworking the spacing* and fixing the
    curves on the glyphs at the moment. Things like the top heavy z was something
    I didn't see, but now you've mentioned it I see how it makes the character look
    top heavy with the equal widths.\r\n\r\nI'll look at the other 'problem' characters
    as well; I find the 's' one of the trickiest to do. In terms of the Q, what other
    characters do you look at to make an equivalence in the tail? \r\n\r\nI'm do like
    the Koch form 'g', so it should be fun to try that out. I didn't go with the \"standard\"
    single-storey 'g' because something about it bothers me, I can't explain exactly
    but it can occasionally trip me up when reading something with it sometimes, usually
    in roman sans-serifs. Strangely, it doesn't bother me half as much when it's in
    a blackletter style typeface; I don't know if this is due to personal bias, something
    quirky with my eyes/brain or something else.\r\n\r\n*I think sometime I must have
    shaved off as many as 10 units from each side of all glyphs as an earlier version
    was much looser (probably too loose but I went too far the other way). "

  body: "The \"g\" on the left isn't bad for an open-bottom form (which is hard to
    get right since there's less of a precedent so people don't just accept it unthinkingly*)
    but it's too playful here - you need to figure out how to tame it (maybe make
    it more rigid/rectilinear). As for your second \"g\", the advantage of the Koch-style
    form is its ability to accommodate a short descender (while avoiding a \"g\" that
    looks way too small**) but that's not the case here, so... A way you can still
    use it though is making such a \"g\" look larger - by making the head larger (although
    that might clash with the overall character of the font). And in any case you
    should consider removing the spiky part in the middle. Look at Ernestine's \"g\"
    for a very successful Koch-style \"g\":\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\n*
    To me the closed form is actually inferior.\r\n\r\n** Any binocular \"g\" <em>must</em>
    look at least slightly small, otherwise bigger things go wrong.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a certain cheapening Trebuchet-ness to the overall appearance of text.\r\n\r\nIt's
    been said before, but the cut-off of the |e|'s tail looks like a mistake. Those
    on |a 3 5| have a milder version of the same problem. I'd suggest bringing those
    in line with the straight cut-offs that dominate the rest of the letters. |6|
    and |9| look tilted, probably because of their slanted cut-offs.\r\n"
