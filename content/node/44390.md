  body: "ooooh, B&W is the best by far!  yum!\r\n\r\nI'd just watch that you place
    the exact same width between the stroke of the 'c' and the 'c' and the 's'\r\n\r\nRight
    now how close the 'c' and the 's' looks awkward in relation to the rest of the
    logo"

    the 'S' sits a bit too tight in the 'C'. Check it out at small sizes.\r\n\r\nI
    would go with a vivid second color - like green for a black cats eyes >\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/catsam_BW_5974_3896.png]"

    use a happy color like this green. You could play with the bottom S in order to

    not that that's a bad thing either.\r\n\r\nPersonally, of all I've seen I think
    this last post is hitting something gold, the left-most one is wonderful.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'd try, is pumping up the letter-spacing on the word \u2018design\u2019 so it's
    the same width as CATSAM, but without being the same height.\r\n\r\nbest of luck!"
