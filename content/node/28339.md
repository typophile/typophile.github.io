  on pp. ZU1\u201324) and <a href=\"http://www.thesetimesdemandthetimes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on-line</a>.
  Anyone has an idea of the typeface used? That Humanist sans-serif, in all caps,
  generously letterspaced?"

  body: "Nice traps; and unusually narrow caps compared to the lc in the lighter \"See
    the TV Spot\". Makes me think of phone book fonts. Also, interesting curvature
    on the legs of the \"M\" (zoom in to a big one in \"THESE TIMES DEMAND THE TIMES\"
    while the intro is playing).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
