  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It has occurred to me that moderating the posts of new users would not be too onerous a restriction to impose for this forum&hellip; <em>with one important exception</em>.</p>
<p>But making that exception would help solve <em>another</em> problem this forum has, in addition to the spam problem.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my modest proposal:</p>
<p>New users would see their posts await approval before appearing on the forum - usually, only the first post would need to be so delayed - <em>except if they&rsquo;re posting to one of the Type ID boards</em>.</p>
<p>Because if you want a Type ID, you may be in a hurry. And this would be of a huge benefit in keeping the Type ID requests in the right place!</p>
<p>So, as I said - two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Type ID request showing up everywhere all over, I was thinking we could create a filter that would be &lsquo;trained&rsquo; to redirect a Type ID request to the Type ID forum. I have notice that most every Type ID request has key words in them such as &raquo;&gt; help, does anyone, please identify, &laquo;&lt; etc.. Spam filters use word recognition so I don&rsquo;t see why we couldn&rsquo;t do the same for a Type Id filter?</p>

<p>Okay. My guess (and it&rsquo;s just a guess) is that the spam filters already weed out most of the spam so the number of first-time posts to review each day wouldn&rsquo;t be that huge, but I don&rsquo;t really know for sure as there are some forums at Typophile that I don&rsquo;t read.</p>

<p>New user accounts for Type ID show up in the General, Blogs, and some in Design forums. Outside of Type ID new user accounts I&rsquo;d guess that between 0-5 new user accounts are generated everyday.</p>
<p>So if that is about all, then I&rsquo;m guessing that a 24hour account approval period would not realize all that much of a drop in overall forum activity &hellip;maybe?</p>

<p>Things may have changed with the new spam filters, but back when I used to deal with some of this, Typophile was getting around 100–200 new accounts in a 24-hour period. These were mostly what I call “sleeper” spam accounts – dummy accounts with spam links in profile fields. And sometimes one of these “users” would surface after several months (or even a year) and post a spam thread.</div>
