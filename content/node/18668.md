body: "Ok designing a typeface is a small part of my thesis \"Designing for Vision
  Problems\". I just started, so I need initial crits (i figure I'll need like 20
  before its done). I will post the complete set soon.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nOpen
  Counters and Apertures\r\nLarge X-height\r\nShort ascenders + descenders\r\n\r\nThe
  name is based on Marla Runyan: an olympic, blind runner whos nothing short of amazing.\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys."

  body: "great project, a few questions:\r\n1. Why sans ? wouldn't the serifs would
    help the reading?\r\n2. Why short ascenders? wouldn't that make it less readable?\r\n\r\nComments\r\n1.
    why not try to put slight changes in the stroke as the pen moves around the form.\r\nI
    think that helps, check out gill sans next to another sans. Its stroke varies
    slightly, gives it life. You have it going in the bowl of the \"a\", and the leg
    of the \"R\".\r\n\r\nSuch a great idea for a font? are there others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well see I had those same questions too but the past couple of weeks Ive
    been doing nothing but research and I fonud out that for people with vision impairement,
    SANS is a tremendously better than serifs. The idea is to make clean simple glyphs.
    NO fancy techinques or serifs here because when its blurred, none of it will matter.....only
    hurt the legibility.\r\n\r\nI see what you mean about the subtle strokes. Good
    point."

  body: "wow, what do you mean by research? have you tested this on impared people?
    \r\n\r\nIf it is the blurring effect that makes the serif worst that would mean
    sans is more noticable at a distance, where I would assume the same blurring takes
    place.\r\n\r\nlets try it.\r\n\r\nI see what you mean\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/impared.jpg]\r\namazingly
    I think I slight blur makes the sans even easier to read or at least bolder\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slight
    blurimpared.jpg]\r\neven at this stage the sans is still holding up.\r\nBut maybe
    thats just cause te large x-height?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heavy

  body: "Typography for people with vision impairement was one of the possible topics
    I was doing recherche for my diploma thesis, and I think if I hadn't found anything
    slightly more interesting, it would have made the run. I did this blurring tests
    as well, trying to find out whether there is potential in it.\r\n\r\nWhat I also
    found out: clearly distinguishable letterforms: none should be too similar to
    an other.\r\n\r\nOpen counters and apertures, and large x-height will do the job
    well, I think they help in the same manner as they helped Adrian Frutiger when
    designing Frutiger for airport Charles de Gaulle.\r\nI don't think though that
    short ascenders and descenders will help much, I rather have the impression that
    longer ones are more helpful, but this would have to be tested for single words
    as well as for larger amounts of texts (as this may change there).\r\nWhat will
    also help you is to have a look on Typedesign for Screen. The solutions for low
    resolution displays may be useful for your task as well.\r\n\r\nOn the design:
    should it be easy to the eye for non-impaired people as well? This would be a
    much harder job, except you make compromises.\r\n\r\nLettershapes (if you need
    this already. based on the assumption that this should be for seeing people as
    well, I can't test the other one):\r\nR: top is very geometric, descenter just
    a bit too weak\r\ny: right upper side too bold. Do you want to have such tiny
    details like the hooked tail in it?\r\na: appears to be meager compared to the
    rest\r\ngeneral: The overshoot of round shapes is exaggerated --> n and a look
    larger than y and u. u seems to hang below baseline.\r\n\r\nsebilar"
