body: "A client of mine is reporting some strange behaviour of the OT features of
  a font in Quark XPress 7 and 8. In some documents the features are accessible, in
  others they are not. The OT features of this font work properly in Adobe InDesign.\r\nIs
  this a Quark issue? If so, what is the best work-around to avoid this behaviour?
  It also seems that the features work in the same document the other day when they
  were not working the day before. ?\r\nAny advice greatly appreciated."
