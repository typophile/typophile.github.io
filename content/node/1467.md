  body: OK. It&#39;s official - all designs are up. If you have submitted a design
    but do not see it anywhere, do this. <BR> <BR>1. Look very carefully, under the
    day&#40;s&#41; you submitted entries. <BR>2. If you still don&#39;t see it, email
    us at <a href="mailto:tee@typophile">tee@typophile</a> and tell us your  name
    and original date you  sent the design. <BR> <BR>In the meantime I&#39;ll go back
    through and see if I can find any that may have slipped through our fingers. With
    some ~326 entries, it&#39;s entirely possible.  <BR> <BR>jb
