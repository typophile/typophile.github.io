  a 17th-century engraving that is the centerpiece of the poster) with information
  about the current event (title, date, location). And I'd like this information to
  appear in a font that emulates the original typeface as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat
  font would be the best match here to convey a feel for the period? \r\n\r\nSuggestions
  much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANewSystem-type_4366.jpg]"

  body: It's a bit of a different feel, but <a href=http://kimeratype.com/>Lagarto</a>
    (click on English, then KTF type gallery) came to mind. The only other one I could
    think of is Storm's <a href=http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-63-antique>Antique</a>
    suite.
