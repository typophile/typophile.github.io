  of a sans-serif, lower case, double-storey letter g. The G doesn't have the link
  between the loop and the bowl. It sits simply as two rings, the top one with an
  ear. I know it was quite beauitful, but I can't find it. If anyone can supply a
  link to an image that would be great. If there is a typeface that comes to mind
  that would also be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    It was more along the lines of the News gothic g though \u2013 perhaps even bliss.
    I may have mislead with the 'simple rings explanation'. Thanks so much for your
    suggestions."
