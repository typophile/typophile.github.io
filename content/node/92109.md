    interface.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there are some of us who only
    sell through distributors. This is a business decision that each font maker must
    make, whether to take on the responsibility of dealing with customers and payments
    directly or not. I did this for a while, and I liked the direct contact with customers
    most of the time, but the extra percentage of income from the direct sale of a
    license was not worth being on-call 25/7 for support issues, which most often
    were from novice users with installation or download difficulties. I am a one-person
    operation. I'm happy to pay my distributors for taking this burden from me and
    leaving me to do what I do best (presumably).\r\n\r\nSorry for going somewhat
    off-topic, but there seems to be an assumption that distributors are a bad deal
    for font makers, and that they should be avoided if possible. If MyFonts' \"large
    library and great interface\" makes it easy for you to find the fonts you want,
    don't be a jerk. If font makers don't want you to buy their fonts on MyFonts for
    some reason, they shouldn't be on MyFonts."

    You'd think a competitor could come along and tell all their artists they'll give
    them a giant cut of the sales to go exclusive with them. A stock agency with 1/6
    the sales volume could make it worth it for an artist by turning their 15% share
    to a 90% share. And by poaching major talent from iStock, the smaller rival will
    grow, benefiting the artist and the agency alike. But what do I know.

  body: You'll probably find most foundries here that are on MyFonts are on a better
    rate than 50%. But even at that rate, the exposure you gain that you wouldn't
    on your own is invaluable. That's why many foundries that do sell direct also
    go through MyFonts. It'd be interesting to hear a breakdown of their sales, but
    I'd wager the vast majority of their income is from MyFonts sales rather than
    direct.

    amount of work it took to get MyFonts to where they are today. Sell one font on
    your own at 100% royalty rate, versus, say, ten at 50% (conservative estimate
    of differing exposure levels!) and it becomes clear that MyFonts is the better
    option. If you're coming at it from a point of \"I spent ages making this font
    and they just take their cut for doing not very much\" then go out on your own.
    I prefer the \"MyFonts get me way more exposure than I could dream of getting
    on my own and they only charge a small (relative to other distributors) cut for
    it\" way of thinking. Each to their own though, I suppose."

    if one designer is getting a better rate than others, I can see why they wouldn't

    is, it didn't take an effort anywhere near 50-50 parity to the development of
    over 100,000 fonts by 1000 foundries. The simplest way to earn more money -- a
    much more cost-effective use of time than developing another font for sale at
    MyFonts -- would be to organize with other foundries and demand a higher base
    rate for all designers or else MyFonts will find themselves lacking products to
    take half the profits of. But I have a Norma Rae streak in me.

    so a strike could be highly effective. Losing distinctive, well-known bestsellers
    like Museo and Storefront Pro would be especially problematic. People looking
    for those fonts will just Google them and start buying elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf MyFonts'
    50 bestselling fonts, 11 come from itself (Monotype, aka Berthold, Bitstream and
    Linotype -- and several others that aren't in the top 50), while of the rest,
    the majority share comes from just 7 sources: Jos Buivenga (exljbris), Hannes
    von D\xF6hren (HVD), Hubert Jocham, Emily Lime, Ryan Martinson (Yellow Design
    Studio), Parachute and URW++. I'd imagine Mark Simonson, owner of #1 bestseller
    Proxima Nova; and Font Bureau, with two entries on the top 50 and a large library;
    could also wield some influence.\r\n\r\nThere's also grounds for a DOJ antitrust
    suit against Monotype, as they are the Walmart (MyFonts), Target (fonts.com),
    Proctor and Gamble (Monotype), Johnson & Johnson (Linotype) and Unilever (ITC)
    of their industry, setting the terms by which every smaller manufacturer must
