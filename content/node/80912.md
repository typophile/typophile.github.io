  contextuality</a>\r\n\r\nAn essay I wrote for I Love Typography.\r\nSome history,
  some theory, and some show and tell.\r\n\r\nMy apologies to John Hudson for not
  mentioning the readability contextuality feature in his Gabriola face, I don't claim
  an encyclopedic memory on the subject, and observations can get buried in the Shinn
  memory until I see something that reminds me. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
