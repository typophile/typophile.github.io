  body: Not ITC Bookman--notice the serifs on top of the T. It's Bookman Oldstyle,
    the one that Microsoft bundles. The reason it screams "Ed's my dad" is because
    it was derived partly from ITC's version.

  body: "It gets tricky when foundries create similar faces to stand in for the originals.
    \r\n\r\nBookman Oldstyle is to ITC Bookman as Arial is to Helvetica (although
    in this case the result is an improvement in some ways--a little closer to the
    pre-ITC original Bookman)."
