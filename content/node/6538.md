  body: Paul - for you second post you might look at <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?268">Thundirbird</a>
    and it&#39;s variants. <BR>For you first post, about Ferrero Rocher, may be it&#39;s
    custom designed by <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?11J">Athur Baker</a>
    - look at Hiroshige, Mercator, Baker Signet.
