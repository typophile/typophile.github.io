body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI use a certain font for writing musical chord symbols. Now I changed
  my software for creating sheet music. I would like to keep using my old font with
  the new software, but unfortunately for transposing, it requires that all twelve
  pitch names (A, A sharp, B flat etc.) are on certain places in the font. Which of
  course isn't the case.\r\n\r\nI hoped there would be a way to map the characters
  in my old font according to the positions in the new font. E.g. a symbol that used
  to be on Unicode 0021 would have to go to 00A8 etc.\r\n\r\nAs this is not possible
  from within the software, can anyone suggest a way to do this outside? It only concerns
  5 characters, so it would be ok to spend an hour doing it. However, I wouldn't want
  to buy software for this issue...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\nPeter"

    to hand-editing text files (as opposed to working with a GUI), have a look at
    <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html\">TTX</a>. It's free and
    it will let you do what you're trying to do.\r\n\r\nYou can download Windows and
    Macintosh versions from the <cite>ttx binaries</cite> section on <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29196>this
    page</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Windows, I compiled a newer version of TTX a
    while back that you can download from <a href=\"http://www.font.org/software/ttx/\">Adam
    Twardoch's TTX page</a>."
