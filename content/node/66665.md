body: "Is it possible to change the way the preview window in FontLab renders the
  font I'm working on? \r\n\r\nI'm working on a screen font, and when I test it within
  the application I'm making it for it renders really sharp, stems are sharp 1 px
  lines. In the FontLab preview the render is much smoother, pretty much every line
  is very fuzzy. \r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking, maybe I can change how fontlab renders the
  font, to more accurately emulate how it's displayed in different rendering engines?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSvenni"

    renderer with its own autohinting. This is not customizable. \r\n\r\nIf you activate
    the TrueType or the Type 1 hinting tool, you will be able to preview fonts using
    the system renderers (TrueType or Type 1), and you can even select some different
    renderers (this is different for Mac and Windows versions of FontLab Studio). "

    can't seem to find where you select the different renderers. Could you tell me
    where this setting is to be found?\r\nI'm using a Mac, by the way.\r\n\r\nSv."

    the Type 1 hinting tool:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/t1hintingtoolmac_3642.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    pop-up showing the choices is hiding in the tiny icon in the top-right corner
    of the preview pane.\r\n\r\nWith the TrueType hinting tool, only a black and white
    preview (presumably using the FreeType renderer) is available, so no pop-up with
    other choices."

    up on your system beyond pressing the button in the hinting toolbar? I saw on
    an old thread* that you noted it wasn't working in OSX with previous versions
    of Fontlab.\r\nI can't get it to show for me (FL5.0.4 on Leopard). \r\n\r\n* http://www.typophile.com/node/15436"

    was fixed in 5.0. \r\n\r\nTo get the panel, you just open a glyph window and click
    on these two buttons:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/t1hintingpreviewpanel_5498.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't see the panel, perhaps it's off-screen somewhere. That can happen if
    you were running FL with a different monitor set up previously."

  body: Thanks Mark. I think it was an off-screen situation. I deleted my preferences
    and now I can see it.
