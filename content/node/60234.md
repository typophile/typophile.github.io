  designing a display font from scratch.\r\n\r\nI am using FontLab 5.0.2 on a Mac
  running OS X 10.5.7 and I have designed my font in illustrator and have been copy
  and pasting each Glyph into FontLab individually.\r\n\r\nI have figured out my kerning
  classes and I am happy with the results in apps. such as Indesign and Illustrator,
  at the moment i am just using FontLabs auto generated hinting.\r\n\r\nHowever, my
  new font displays in my version of the Mac app FontBook with seemingly none of my
  kerning classes recognised, it seems to recognize some from different classes but
  leaving most of the typeface looking really unprofessional and unkerned, why could
  this be? "

    the system font caches to get a proper display in FontBook. Use an utility like
    FontFinagler or Cocktail.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Thanks Bert, I tried that but to no avail, so I installed FontAgent Pro to
    see if that would make any difference since Font Book is not always that great
    at managing fonts apparently, but this also displays the font the same, with irregular
    kerning.\r\n\r\nI have now noticed that this happens in the mac app. TextEdit
    too, although as before Illustrator, Indesign and Photoshop CS3 all work fine.\r\n\r\nI
    am wondering whether I need to watch a few more tutorials on kerning classes and/or
    maybe some  even they way I am generating my font, which by the way I am doing
    as OpenType TT.\r\n\r\nAny more pointers?"

  body: I think a lot of applications do not pull in kerning data. Even font managers
    often give preview without showing the kerning. In Font Reserve's preview you
    can use the pull down menu and get font info which will list some kerning general
    kerning info. I'm surprised that text edit didn't. Were you in rich text format
    as opposed to plain text?

    'oldstyle' kerning tables since I created each of these in the 'kerning' setting
    (bottom left hand drop down) in my classes window, and nothing lists as 'OpenType,
    only the latter."
