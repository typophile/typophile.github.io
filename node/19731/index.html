<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Six weeks away from graduation, and I am redoing yet another résumé. I have really focused a lot on typography through my studies, and am planning on furthering my education into grad school. Essentially, I do need this to look good, and be typeset well. Below are the specifications and the details about the design.
Size= 7.25 x 10.25
Typeface Indetification-
Name and Footer= Meridien Roman
All other= Kepler
My main concerns are:
1) That the hierarchy is clear, easy to follow, and understandable.
2) It has been brought to my attention that I have used a category to seperate my "Technical Qualifications", where as I have not included categories for "Education" and "Experience" for it would ruin my hierarchy. It is my opinion that these two categories are not needed, as the first two things on a résumé are typically your education and your previous experience. The question of flow is really the one posed, as some seem to feel that this omission causes an interruption.
3) I have utilized small caps in the sentence fragements where necessary, however, the term "OSX" baffles me. Should this be set in standard magiscules, or do they cause an interruption in the typography?
4) At this point, I have not yet decided how exactly I am going to orient the text block on the page, wether it be justified left with a larger right margin, centered, or what have you. If you have an opinion on this as well, I am more than open to hearing what you have to say.
I really appreciate any suggestions and criticism, and the harsher the better. A dilutted opinion is one less valueable to my goal. Thanks.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>In my opinion, as far as I can gather from a quick glance.
<strong>Dash issues:</strong>
I’d question your use of n-dashes instead of hyphens in your body text;
I’d also question your use of n-dashes instead of m-dashes in your dates.
I have neither Meridien nor Kepler. Their respective hyphens may be longer than usual (it seems so), nevertheless I’d use m-dashes for your dates.
<strong>Grammar issues:</strong>
I’d question your omission of full-stops (periods to the American English folk).
I’d hyphenate the words “print” and “based” to read “print-based”.
Things are “comprised of” other things.
Hope this helps.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I have always been told that n-dashes are preferred, as opposed to a standard hyphen. An m-dash does seem rather obtrusive in length for the use in dates, at least with Kepler. I suppose I could just substitute a glyph from one of the condensed weights to remedy this however. Perhaps you can recommend a font that has well proportioned m and n-dashes that I could view to gain a better understanding of just what a well proportioned dash should look like, width wise.
I also avoided periods upon another recommendation. I felt, as others did, that since I have avoided using complete senteces, that puntuation was not necessary. Additionally, I chose the word "comprise" based on the recommendation of Strunk and White. Their definition relates that this term literally translates to "embrace". I don't mind changing the word though, it is really not a big loss either way, although I would prefer to correct it so that I position the writing to affect the middle 80% of the population whom have the average understanding of grammar and spelling. This seems to be the best tactic, as the bottom 10% and the top 10% of designers are clearly not where I am aiming as of just yet, being not a seasoned designer myself.
Thank you for your suggestions, they are appreciated.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Its a little lengthy. Your name can be more prominent. Overall, its nice and clean....although it lacks personality. I think you could use a touch of humor or quirkiness in there, whether it is textual or graphical. Then again, thats where the line between graphic designers and everyone else gets more apparent.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I feel like there is not enough white space. Its hard to scan your resume. I feel like your hoping they will read the whole thing.
Also, I would try to avoid justifying the right margin. Iam a wrong. Someone prove me wrong. Ive been working on my resume lately but I think there are standards you are trying to break. I feel your contact info is tucked at the bottom and hidden. And over all the design is to grey.
Dont get me wrong but based on my research this is how I feel. You definately are great at typography and iam impressed overall. I will post mine if you like. Maybe I should shut up.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>No, don't do that mad_grab. I have had some many different résumé's at this point, so, its not like I don't understand where you are coming from. I did not really set out to break any standards, and I typically do prefer to set well proportioned, fully justified text than to have ragged, unbalanced lines of type. I do do both, but on this occasion, I felt it better to keep it simple, the old KISS principle. The lack of character might be bad, but really, I aimed at again, easy readability. I was surprised to hear Prakash Nair comment on the length, as its far shorter than any other résumé I have done in the past, its not even on a full 8.5 x 11 sheet. Also, I should point out that the character comes through the paper based on the stock that I have chosen to print with. I ran across it really on accident, its a laid text weight from Neenah, that is actually a light blue, you can view a sample <a href="http://www.neenahpaper.com/itemlisting/index.asp?ft=Home&s=Laidc&b=05&c=CBL">here</a>. I think that this lends enough character, plus the odd size, to set me apart.
I agreed although about my name and contact info, I will make those items more prominent. After all, those are rather important items of information.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mastery comprehension?
Medium singular, media plural
Strikes me as having too many adjectives and I get the feeling that they are there to make the line lengths.
I don't mean to be harsh, but it is worth considering these things
It is worth indicating the generation of software, and making a brief self-introduction to a potential employer, for example marital status, driving licence, home address etc.
Good luck with the job hunt.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>the use of adjectives comes from the fact that I don't like to simply use the same words over and over again. Is there any other way to go about that, not sure.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>That is a fair point, however it could also appear that you have looked up skilful in a thesaurus, the best alternative I have used is an introductory sentence along the lines of "I have full working knowledge of (software…)", you could then follow/integrate the list with bulleted (or single line) statements.
