body: Hi out there, <BR> <BR>Below is a concept for updating an identity &#40;Donovans&#41;
  that for the past thirty years has used a scripty like font in a couple variations.
  Here&#39;s their website to see the logo in action http://www.donovans.ca &#40;we
  didn&#39;t design the site&#41;. In one of the initial meetings with Donovans, they
  mentioned that wanted to explore a totally different direction b/c they are moving
  to a new location and it wasn&#39;t bold enough when contained in logo soup.  <BR>
  <BR>Donovans is a women&#39;s clothing store that caters to the thirty-five to fifty
  year old professional. Similar stores would include Lord &amp; Taylor and Marshal
  Fields. Part of my inspiration came from http://www.miumiu.com/ and http://www.jjill.com
  where the logotypes visually seemed pretty interesting.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately,
  in the end they felt they had too much equity in the script and decided that is
  where the energy should be spent in making it better. Too bad, but I guess that&#39;s
  why design is considered a business rather than art. As a critique visually, any
  comments? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Michael <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1400.gif"

    and the &#34;V&#34; and &#34;A&#34; are clotting a bit, and I might make the &#34;S&#34;
    more narrow/closed, but I personally like it. On the other hand, unless they start
    selling clothing for dominatrix, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s appropriate.  :-/ <BR>

  body: ' I like the look of it but it does read heavy on the masculine influence.
    Certainly a stark contrast to a Marshall Fields srpingtime script. <BR> <BR>The
    way the specimen is shown as stark black on white probably influences the feel
    also. I bet a really elegant inline effect or 3D convex gold letter would certainly
    move the feeling back toward an upscale women&#39;s shop. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

    TARGET="_top">http://www.lindex.de/</A> I lke the logo, because it is very feminin
    and very subtle. <BR>maybe this can give you a few ideas. I think your logo is
    not subtle enough. <BR> <BR>Jacques'

    I don&#39;t think you were off target in the design, its just they have an identity
    already. There'

  body: ' It&#39;s amazing. I thought, as did Michael, along  <BR>those same lines
    ... ergo &#39;the discriminate  <BR>dominatrix.&#39;  <BR> <BR>one of the problems
    I can see is that you&#39;ve a few too <BR> many typographic/graphic tricks going
    on for such a  <BR>small word. The &#39;S&#39;seems foreign and too open. the
    &#39;V&#39; and  <BR>the &#39;A&#39; seem foreign as well... or maybe it should
    be said  <BR>that the &#34;ONO .. N&#34; are one family, the &#34;VA&#34; are
    another,  <BR>the &#34;S&#34; a third and the &#34;D&#34; a fourth. I like the
    idea behind  <BR>the &#34;D&#34;, but then the trick is gone and it is all monoline  <BR>and
    round then it is monoline and sharp and so on.  <BR>Could you incorporate the
    trick of the &#34;D&#34; somewhat in  <BR>the &#34;N&#34;s? I think the &#34;D&#34;
    is strong, but because of how  <BR>strong it is, visually, it is alienating the
    other characters. <BR> <BR>after reading this ... &#34;trick&#34; is too strong
    a word. &#34;style&#34;  <BR>suits my thoughts more. '
