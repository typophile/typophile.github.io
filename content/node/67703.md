  got a completed font that I'd like to generate. Both names and unicode numbers are
  right. But, when I view the font in index mode, the glyphs are all in the wrong
  position, and this shows when viewing the font in the glyphs window in Adobe Illustrator.
  \r\n\r\nHow do I get the index corrected?"

  body: Never mind. Brought it into FL5 and sorted by unicode in the glyph menu and
    that fixed it. Ugh. At least I didn't have to sort them by hand. Now I get to
    go back and fix all of the fonts I didn't realize were screwed.
