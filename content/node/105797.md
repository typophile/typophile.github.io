body: "In my last topic I created a logo for Tasty Morsils, I didn't really care for
  it. I created this logo/mark \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tasty_4868.png]\r\n\r\nI
  thought more into it and many times i think way too hard then i should and go basic.
  what does the name say? Tasty Morsils. Morsel? A morsel is defined as a small bite
  so I created a simple round olive circle with a simple chocolate chip cookie with
  a small bite/morsel in it. \r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think?"

    the t-shirts. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/tasty3_6296.jpg]

  body: "Wow, you've really simplified it! I like the concept but think it needs some
    fine tuning. \r\n\r\nTo me it doesn't look enough like a cookie, although I'm
    not sure what to recommend. (For a moment I thought it was the moon.) And I'd
    try one big bite, not 3 tiny ones, and maybe try it without the crumbs. And I
    like pastels, but on my monitor these colors are too light.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Making the chocolate chips (?) more irregularly shaped would make them look
    more like chocolate chips and less like holes in swiss cheese.

  body: "Now the chocolate chips look too much like chocolate chips. Their style is
    in conflict with the intense modernism of the rest of the logo. I would try making
    them just various oval shapes. I also think an oval shape for the cookie would
    be more dynamic and interesting, and still be in keeping with your modernism.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d
    also change the colour scheme to something warmer. Green seems just wrong for
    a bakery."

  body: "This is definitely an improvement. Simpler is often better in the world of
    logo design.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions. May or may not improve things...\r\n\r\n
    - make all the 'chip' circles the same size. Right now with them different sizes
    it feels a bit like craters on the moon.\r\n\r\n - note that a stylized bite mark
    would be in a semi-circle shape with equal sizes scallops (teeth marks)\r\n\r\n
    - per David's suggestion, make the cookie darker the plat lighter. Might make
    it less 'moon' like. "

  body: "Perhaps some depth, a little more of a 3D look would help. I know that flat
    design is a current trend, but maybe a little shading would help define the shape
    as a cookie. And David makes a good point about the color.\r\n\r\nFor inspiration
    you might try doing a search for \"cookie icon\" at Google images and at some
    stock art companies like iStockPhoto."

  body: "optically the cooky design is not centred over the text.\r\n\r\nThe text
    seems a little light to me (either weight or colour, take your pick.)\r\nthe word
    \"Bakery\" especially. I don't see any problem with being ambiguous with the image,
    burt the text needs to be unmistakable and legible.\r\n\r\nthere were some aspects
    about your first attempt that were worth keeping. the pallet in particular was
    quite nice. What ever might be said about gluten free in the future, baking will
    always mean wheat. Baking with quinoa will be represented by wheat stalks, just
    because it is so ingrained in our brains. you bake with flour. Flour it represented
    by a stalk of wheat. no one you know has actually seen a stalk of wheat, so...
    it's OK. Just do it.\r\n\r\nR"

    I think i need something added to the cake. And yes morsils is spose to be spelled
    that way, Sils is there last name so thats where they get the sils part in morsils. "
