  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Please help me to choose a typeface to use for my daughter&rsquo;s gravestone.
She was 22, she loved reading, horseback riding, skiing, diving. She was intellectual, and had many interests in life.
She was brave and adventurous - and fragile and vulnerable at the same time.
She never was into any frills, hearts, &ldquo;girly&rdquo; things, etc.</p>
<p>I think there will be a stylized image of a young tree in a strong gush of wind on the granite panel and her name and years of birth and death. Everything kept very simple.</p>
<p>There will also be place left for my and my husband&rsquo;s names.</p>

What you&rsquo;re doing is very difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to suggest one of my favorites, FF Avance, because it&rsquo;s a playful but ambivalent design, full of intelligence but still uncertain of what it will become. Also, it has no overly-thin parts which can get lost in engraving. Lastly, it was designed by somebody who also died too young.</p>

If the surface is polished and there is no pattern, then a finely detailed face will hold up.
So the choice of typeface (and size and layout) should work in concert with the choice of stone.</p>
<p>As you intend to deviate from off-the-shelf template options, it may be advisable to engage the services of a professional designer.</p>
<p>What would she have thought of the image you suggest? Depending on the execution there is the possibility it could become overly sentimental.</p>
<p>A contemporary* type in the classic &ldquo;stone-chiselled&rdquo; mode is <a href="http://cartersans.com/index.html">Carter Sans</a>—very robust and un-girly. It would hold up well, even on dark, coarse stone.</p>
<p>*Cousin to the Internet face Verdana, by the same designer.</p>

<p>I appreciate and understand your concern. I am not into any sentimentality either, and I will be very careful not to allow that.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You are right again. But I have no idea how even to start looking for one, where to find them. The monument companies are awful designwise.</p>
<p>I like all three suggested typefaces and will consider using one of them. I am very grateful for all suggestions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Possibly a local graphic designer, they tend to be generalists.
Look for one who has done work with special printing processes such as embossing, foil stamping, spot colors, unusual paper stocks—or &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; graphics i.e. signage. This would indicate that they would have some experience relevant to the tactile requirements of gravestones, even if they have never designed one.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an architect?</p>
<p>If you chose someone local, you can look at stone samples together and discuss with the mason/stonecutter.</p>
<p>You may have to go further afield for a specialist in stone carving.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Getting the assistance of a designer is an excellent idea, but most graphic designers will have zero experience with this kind of project.</p>
<p>I think Nick&rsquo;s idea of talking to local masons/stonecutters might be your best bet. You could also check with a local arts council or college art department to see if they know any local artists who work in stone. Also if your community has a yearly arts festival, the organizers might know some stonecutters they could recommend. You might also try phoning some local funeral homes to see if they can recommend anyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest taking your time to make sure you find someone good. Temporary grave markers are available to mark graves until a permanent stone is ready.</p>
