body: "I have an OT font with TT outlines, created in FontLab and processed with VOLT
  to add the OT features.  VOLT compiles fine and the font installs without complaint
  in Vista.  Screen appearance is fine.  We'll call this font X.  When I print a document
  to my LaserJet 4P, all is well; when I print to my HP OfficeJet Pro, the font does
  not print at all.  On a page with text in various fonts, everything prints fine
  except the portion in Font X; if the document is completely set in Font X, the entire
  page is blank.  Yet Font X embeds properly in PDFs, and the PDF prints on the OfficeJet
  as well as displaying properly on screen.  I should mention perhaps that the font
  supports Hebrew as well as Latin and Greek (but the problem occurs with all three
  scripts).\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have a clue what might be causing this??\r\n\r\nThanks
