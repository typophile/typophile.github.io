  body: i used legato semi-bold recently, knocked out of a dark background at about
    7 points. worked well cos of <BR>&#40;a&#41; weight of type <BR>&#40;b&#41; the
    slightly &#39;pinched out&#39; outer corners / cupped terminals etc countered
    background gain <BR>&#40;c&#41; good registration and minimum ink coverage&#42;
    for the background colour helps  <BR> <BR>&#42;by this i mean use &#40;eg&#41;
    C40K100 rather C100M100Y100K100 etc

    <BR>Also, those sharp corners you mention -very prevalent in the phototype era-
    are called thorns. At least by me.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp'

    studying the design of type at San Jose State in the late seventies, we were taught
    that those design elements &#40;in this thread called thorns and ink traps&#41;
    were included to make the type <i>look</i> better; to make the corners of characters
    appear crisper/sharper than they would appear without them. At that time, if they
    were published at all, they would have been, I believe, delivered as photostats

    either hides something &#40;like what I&#39;ve heard post-facto about the deadline
    simply being too tight&#41; or demotes craft. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, I think chirographers
    tend to have an aversion to traps, since they violate the moving front. Not to
    mention an aversion to [proper] optical scaling. There&#39;s a reason the scale
    axis is missing from G Noordzij&#39;s cube. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Thorns were specifically a phototype phenomenon: a correction to the softening
    of corners that occured in the photographic process. The context in which Lange
    employed thorns was Berthold&#39;s very highly regarded phototype system. I&#39;m
    not aware of anything like thorns being employed before phototype, and very seldom
    since; whereas traps &#40;or reverse thorns, if you like&#41; have been employed
    in metal, photo and digital type.'

  body: 'What thorns do is very different from what traps do. I&#39;ve not found thorns
    of use in digital type, but then I -- like most of our colleagues -- are making
    type for use in a wide range of reproduction technologies. Thorns may be useful
    in some specific printing processes; I don&#39;t know. But the likelihood of their
    being visible -- not what you want -- in other processes seems too great to recommend
    them as a general feature. <BR> <BR>All photo and mechanical processes distort
    letterforms to some degree, even from digital type. So when you go from file to
    film to plate, or direct to plate, you can see the affect of these processes if
    you look closely enough. But two things need to be kept in mind. The first is
    that the different processes and the variables in the individual process make
    it very difficult to predict what might happen to a letterform; so most digital
    type design is process-independent; i.e. it tries to provide the best result possible
    across a wide range of output and reproduction processes. If you know the specific
    processes that a typeface will go through, it is much easier to optimise the design
    for those processes. Which leads to the second thing to keep in mind when considering
    thorns: the rounding of corners in phototypesetting systems was much more pronounced
    than the impact of digital imagesetter or other output device, so the need for
    specific correction was much greater. Because individual companies manufactured
    their own machinery and processes, they could tailor such corrections very specifically
    to these devices. So I would expect that thorns on Berthold phototypes might differ
    from thorns on the types of other manufacturers. In the device-independent digital
    font world, we&#39;ve largely had to give up that level of control, since we can&#39;t
    anticipate the machines on which fonts will be used or processes to which they
    will be subjected.'

    gently. <BR> <BR>One thing though: when you print in reverse, things flip around!
    :-&#41; So in superfamilies with special negative weights for example I can see
    thorns gaining more relevance - especially if they happen to have traps in the
    positives. <BR> <BR>hhp'
