    \"Fasil's\" and \"Adiam\" - \r\nIt seems to me their numbers are recycled characters
    from the alphabet?\r\nyou can see the p recurring\r\nAll the numbers include \"IbP\"
    even the 1706, does that make sense?\r\nThey frame their numbers by put little
    serifs on top and bottom. Is that to signify that they are numbers and not alphabet?\r\n"

  body: "<em>They frame their numbers by put little serifs on top and bottom. Is that
    to signify that they are numbers and not alphabet?</em>\r\n\r\nYes, although not
    all the numbers are directly based on syllables (the writing system is syllabic,
    not alphabetic). In manuscript, numbers are traditionally written with a line
    above and below the full number, not the little disconnected strokes above and
    below individual numbers as shown in these photos. This has not been possible
    to replicate in typography, until now...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NyNum_3774.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
    the Nyala Ethiopic font I made for Microsoft, I use OpenType contextual substitutions
    to create a connecting line above and below numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>All the numbers
    include \u201CIbP\u201D even the 1706, does that make sense?</em>\r\n\r\nPresuming
    the European numbers are years in the Gregorian calendar, I suspect the Ethiopic
    numbers record corresponding dates in one of the Ethiopic calendars, so there
    is not a direct correspondence between the two sets of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe b-like
    shape \u136E is the digit 6. The I-like \u1372 is the number 10. The P-like \u137B
    is a partitioning character indicates that the two numbers to the left of it are
    hundreds, so this sequence \u1372\u136E\u137B indicates 1600.\r\n\r\nI read the
    Ethiopic numbers above 1682-1706 as '1674-1698'.\r\n\r\nI read the Ethiopic numbers
    above 1632-1667 as '16?4-1660' (the number in the tens position might be 20, but
    it seems to be missing a stroke)."
