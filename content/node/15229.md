body: "I recall seeing a font that looks like a bunch of straight-line scratches into
  metal or plastic like people do on subway windows. Each stroke is made up of a bunch
  of uneven, irregular hand-made scratch strokes. Does this sound familiar to anyone?\r\nThanks."

    Greg Samata by that name. Now you get some other 'scratchy' fonts that are still
    in their collection, but the Samata one is gone. You can also search through Part
    14 of the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html\" target=new>
    Script Font ID Guide </a> to see other scratchy varieties, many of which may be
    available around the web as free downloads.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
