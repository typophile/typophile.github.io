  will be created &ndash; an independent journal, perhaps &ndash; which will be more
  than just a source of information about new designs derived from suppliers' handouts,
  but will act as a forum in which critical judgement on typographic matters can be
  expressed and debated, so that typographers will be moved to examine their own preferences
  and prejudices, and type designers will know that their latest offerings must undergo
  the appraisal of people who not only enjoy type but have a critical eye for its
  aesthetic and functional merits.\"\r\n(Walter Tracy, Letters of Credit, p. 214.\r\nPublished
  14 years before the inception of Typophile.)"
