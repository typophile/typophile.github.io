body: I have been trying to identify the name of the font used in this image. It looks
  similar to Klunk Bold and also Xirod but it's not an identical match. If anyone
  knows what the name of this font is I'd really appreciate the help. Thanks!

  body: i think you have it already... Xirod, in all lowercase with a manual skew
    to get the italicized appearance.

    body: The T A and D are different. I can flip the A to get a similar look but
      I can't manipulate the T and D. I think it's another font.

  body: Ahh...that was the issue. I was using the font titled Xirod. After installing
    Xirod Regular it worked perfectly adding a little skew to the letters. Thank you
    so much! I really do appreciate your help with this. Have a great weekend!
