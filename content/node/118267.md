  match - perhaps YOU can do the magic\u2026 again.\r\n\r\nif the exact font is not
  out there, i'll manage without - as i have just found a sharper version of 'salome'
  but working with a font is always handier than blunt PS ;)\r\n\r\npls check on the
  caballe zarzuela cover below as well; i've added better close-ups of 3 missing fonts
  (alas: editing does not put a request back in the top shelf!)\r\n\r\nTHANKS"

  body: "thanks for your input!\r\n\r\nvery greatful that kthomps5 was quick with
    a fitting revival font. but after checking it out i reverted to the idea of using
    PS instead (and it turned out nicely) - as donshottype wrote: existing digital
    versions unfortunately are not very refined. i take it that (2 years on) cristoforo
    hasn't been released?\r\n\r\ni hope everybody is fine in this case with awarding
    the point to donshottype because he has pointed out the neat original font AND
    there is no good digital one out there at the moment."

  body: No problem--I often will scan and tweak from a printed source rather than
    use a digital revival that misses the mark.
