  everywhere. But, when you are specifically trying to find examples of them in use
  they disappear. How bizarre. I'm looking for FF Meta, Bauhaus, Cezanne, Bookman,
  Univers, and Mrs. Eaves. Any leads? Thanks!\r\n"

    for sad reasons we won't mention the Starbucks and Cezanne association. \r\n\r\nSee
    this is what I mean. We all know these fonts are used (have been used) quite a
    lot but we can't think of any. How is that?"

    over the web. Now that I'm pushing 24, I feel like it's on every other wedding
    invitation, lol. I'm guessing that's not the kind of example you're looking for,
    though. :)\r\n\r\nI know I've seen Cezanne in an ad recently, but I can't for
    the life of me remember what it was. Could have been Savoir Beds, but I've only
    found the ones using Sudestada, Affair and Olicana. Maybe I'm hallucinating."

  body: "I have the same problem Tiffany has: I can never remember who uses FF Meta,
    and I have very few examples. I suppose my laziness wins over my vanity. And Meta
    these days is everywhere, not quite like Arial, but certainly in the mainstream,
    so I don't take photographs anymore.\r\n\r\nA few  car brands use Meta: SEAT in
    Spain and Infinity in the US. Dodge has very fat Meta headlines in their campaigns
    in the US. Canon uses it for some products and campaigns, as does Bayer. MetaDesign
    San Francisco uses it (MetaDesign Berlin now uses FF Fago). The FontBook is set
    in FF Meta. The German Employment Agency (Arbeitsamt) used to but changed it for
    Daimler-Benz Corporate S after the last elections. You can still see quite few
    large letters above their buildings in Meta.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudi uses Univers, albeit
    a custom version (by Lucas de Groot at MetaDesign, 1996). So does Messe Frankfurt
    (by Erik Spiekermann and Erik van Blokland, 2006). Sorry \u2013 too late to check
    urls."
