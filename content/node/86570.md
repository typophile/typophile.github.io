  draw small caps.\r\ni am facing the following problems. I have googled for it but
  it seems everyone just knows where to draw their small caps.( they are mostly discussing
  about weight and size but not where to draw them in font lab , i mean)\r\nWhat are
  the Unicode ranges for them and how to access those glyph cells\r\n\r\nPS I am a

  body: "Please disregard the above comment -- it was misdirected. Apparently you
    can't edit a post after a certain amount of time has elapsed.\r\n\r\nYou can place
    your small caps in any glyph cell you choose -- just then make sure to rename
    it appropriately and remove any spurious unicode index. Alternately, you can select
    an entire range of glyphs, copy them, append them, and then in the contextual
    menu choose more->add suffix to name to automatically create cells named a.smcp,
    b.smcp, etc.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
