  body: "As Elzo says, it's probably not a font - at least not a commercially or freely
    available one. That tends to be the way with car/motoring manufacturers. If it's
    just the spirit of the thing that you want to replicate, then DaFont might yield
    something useful. Otherwise, I think you may be stumped.\r\n\r\n-NJ"
