  image. Anyone an idea?\r\n\r\nI don't think it's Helvetica, although that was my
  first idea.\r\n\r\nThere probably has been some manipulation to the text, so an
  exact match isn't likely.\r\n\r\nTIA, Robin"

  body: "Sorry for the double post, but I just realized that this isn't Myriad Light...
    It's a Helvetica, the closest I can get to it is with a Helvetica Neue LT Std
    using the '35 thin'-variant at a 41,64 pt. Then a 164% vertical scale and 135%
    horizontal scale. Tracking at 20 and small caps. That's what I use instead of
    the sample and it looks like [[http://www.chalk-webdesign.nl/headertxt.gif|this]].\r\n\r\nRobin"

    a look at some of the details.\r\n\r\nThis one is yours:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture5_6161.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mcad_5753.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helv_5137.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    first of my samples is a slightly more extended version of Myriad. The second
    is Helvetica Neue. \r\n\r\nPay special attention the capital G, C, S, the @ symbol
    and even the capital B and K.\r\n\r\nDo you now agree that your submitted is Myriad?\r\n\r\nMikey
