  everyone in class will choose him, so I need suggestions-- I need someone who has

  body: You could always do Tom Carnase who worked with Herb Lubalin. Or how about
    someone like <a href="http://www.pushpininc.com/">Seymor Chwast</a>?

  body: "now, I don't know edgy Paul Rand is, but I believe he boiled logo design
    down to it's very essence and many of his logos have lasted 40 years and are still
    just as relevant today. (think IBM's logo for example)\r\n\r\nWell, the other
    names here are also good idea, and the people all have their own characteristics
    and are all quite different people.\r\n\r\nBest of luck to you on this project,
    and let us know what you uncovered after you're done!"
