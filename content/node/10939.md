  <BR> <BR>This is the first time that i attempted to do a typeface,and i may say
  this site is the major responsible to put my hands on work. So  i just wanna say
  tanxs to everyone who participates in here and continue with the good job in the
  maintenance of this wonderfull place. <BR> <BR>As a begginer, i have many doubts
  in how to do a typeface, and i know i still have many work to do on this font, i
  start it about a month and now i really would like to hear some opinions and some
  answers to technical problems that i have, to continue and improve my work. <BR>I
  haven&#39;t done the capitals neither the numberals, since there are some points
  that i need some help. <BR> <BR>So comments are very welcome. <BR> <BR>Since now
  tanxs to all <BR> <BR>Luis

  body: ' Hello Luis and congratulations for the type face, good starting. I also
    want to make some suggestings and questions. The l/c x have different expessures,
    which is visible if you use as a display font, but is looking great with small
    sizes. I prefere to see that kind of forms a relation betten then which create
    a better uniformity for all letters, for exemple &#40; use the letter &#40;o&#41;
    to create the bowl of the &#40;g&#41;, &#40;b&#41;, &#40;d&#41;, &#40;p&#41;,
    &#40;q&#41;, or using the letter &#40;n&#41; to give the aperture and struture
    for the &#40;y&#41;,&#40;u&#41;.  <BR> <BR>1 &#62; Did you use any over-shoot
    &#40;baseline overshoot, x-height overshoot &#41; to differentiate the limits
    of the round parts?  <BR> <BR>2 &#62; How you make the relation betten letters
    when use the round terminal &#40; b, e, q&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Its very interesting
    your type face and I want to see how your serene grow up during the time.  <BR>Boa
    apari&ccedil;&atilde;o Luis e for&ccedil;a com esta tua bonita tipografia / Comprimentos.  <BR>

  body: ' If this is your first effort, I think you have great instincts - make sure
    they survive your upcoming &#34;formal&#34; learning effort. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    go further than Stephen and say that I think there are actually too many good
    ideas here! They&#39;re fighting for attention, and I think more discipline would
    create more functionality. So I&#39;d spread out the good ideas over multiple
    fonts&#42;, instead of maybe trying to make one &#34;ultimate&#34; font &#40;which
    never works&#41;. For example, your &#34;e&#34; has a nice organic feel, and the
    stem on your &#34;o&#34; is amazing, but together they&#39;re maybe too much of
    a good thing. And then there are some glyphs which are a bit &#42;too&#42; plain,
    like the &#34;x&#34; I think has a lot more potential. <BR> <BR>&#42; Maybe a
    set of fonts that work together? <BR> <BR>hhp '

    fonts here. <BR> <BR>&#34;b&#34;, &#34;e&#34;, &#34;f&#34;, &#34;k&#34;, &#34;m&#34;,
    &#34;n&#34;, &#34;o&#34;, &#34;q&#34;, and &#34;t&#34; all have a similar feel,
    taking the more innovative road, while <BR> <BR>&#34;d&#34;, &#34;g&#34;, &#34;h&#34;,
    &#34;p&#34;, &#34;u&#34;, &#34;v&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, &#34;x&#34;, and &#34;z&#34;
    all fit together in the more conservative path. <BR> <BR>The remaining characters
    &#40;&#34;a&#34;, &#34;c&#34;, &#34;i&#34;, &#34;j&#34;, &#34;l&#34;, &#34;r&#34;,
    &#34;s&#34;, and &#34;y&#34;&#41; could adequately fit with either of the other
    two sets as they are, or they could be pushed even closer to conformity to either
    set with slight modifications. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to see a new &#34;x&#34;
    designed to echo the design of the &#34;k&#34;, for example. And inverting the
    existing &#34;n&#34; could be an interesting approach to the &#34;u&#34;, especially
    with how that would position the &#34;u&#34;&#39;s tail. A similar treatment could
    be adapted to the &#34;d&#34;, &#34;g&#34;, &#34;p&#34; and &#34;y&#34;. <BR>

  body: ' Although I understand both points made by Hrant and David, well I have to
    say that I enjoy the similarity but not the identical to the nth degree nature
    of this type. Knowing Hrant&#39;s love near fetish &#91; ;-&#41; &#93; with Rotis
    I think I know what he&#39;s saying and that would be interesting, I&#39;m not
    necessarily disagreeing here. IMO some display type gets boring when all of the
    characters are too identical in nature. Make sense? '

    v, x, z&#39; seem too condensed than the rest of the font. and usualy the &#39;o&#39;
