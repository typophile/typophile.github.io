  body: "I love REKORD designed by http://www.hn2o.de/\r\ndefinatly loved the thread
    @ http://typophile.com/node/71963 aswell.\r\n\r\nHowever I've noticed that the
    Russian Quality Font gets much closer to the 'S' in the original.  I'm searching
    for the font its based off for a similar design I'm doing for a Hair Salon.  I'm
    guessing that if I can't find one close enough I'm just going to edit that."
