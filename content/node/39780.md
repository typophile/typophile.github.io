  body: Personally, organizing by foundry does me little good. When I'm looking for
    a font to use for a project I'm much more likely to think "what's a good condensed
    sans serif?" than "I wonder if anything from H&FJ would work for this project".
    I think you should consider your own criteria - I realize a lot of typophiles
    do organize by foundry. The only two foundries that I have "sets" for in my Font
    Explorer are House Industries and Emigre, both of which (to me) have a pretty
    distinct personality. Plus your themes can extended beyond serif and sans serif
    to categories that might work better for you.

  body: Organize by theme. Besides, you should be able to do a search by foundry if
    you know you want to stick to a specific one.

    they are in sets organized by theme.

  body: "Organizing by foundry helps in some situations, but not ones directly related
    to selecting designs.  If you've purchased/acquired fonts with varying licenses
    (e.g.: free fonts that are free for personal but not commercial use), the terms
    of the licenses might be a better search criteria. This will sometimes correlate
    to the foundry they come from, though not reliably so. Still, some foundries include
    a license brief in the copyright line (not a full EULA, just a statement) and
    this can be helpful.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Once upon a time I organized my fonts like Patty, but then Suitcase gagged
    and I lost it and I have yet to go back. Since that time I''ve organized by foundry.
    Why? Because foundries generally have a style and/or quality that represents the
    lot of their work. Jason''s mention of EULA also is important (to me). '
