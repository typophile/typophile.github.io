  body: "Two things: I'd say the font looks more like a variation on Bank Gothic,
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Gothic]].\r\n\r\nAnd, a topic I'm even more
    interested in, the sign is unlikely to be from a subway line, because its two
    destinations do not match those of any familiar train from any era.  It's most
    likely a placard from some forgotten streetcar route in Manhattan, perhaps across
    Midtown.  \"Hudson\" could refer to Hudson Street rather than the river, in which
    case it would be for a streetcar or bus running across Greenwich Village, but
    that seems less likely to me, as 2nd Avenue is arbitrarily far west for an East
    Side streetcar terminus in the Village.\r\n\r\nI don't have access to a good streetcar
    map from the '20s or '30s just now, but that's my guess."
