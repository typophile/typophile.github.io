body: "I\u2019ve got a book here, published in 1994. The textface is definitely [[Bembo]].
  But there are a few minor differences compared to the Linotype/Monotype Bembo I
  know. The leg on the \u2018R\u2019 isn\u2019t as extrem and the ascender/terminal
  on the \u2018f\u2019 doesn\u2019t lean to right as far. The \u2018W\u2019 seems
  a bit narrower. Was/is there another version of Bembo?"

  body: Not seeing the sample - it's hard to guess, could it be a cousin of Bembo,
    such as [[http://www.monotypefonts.com/Library/HiddenGems.asp?show=dante|Dante]]?

  body: Monotype does make some alternate versions of Bembo. For instance, if you
    check out Monotype Roman Alternate, you will see the difference on the leg of
    the 'R'. Monotype also makes a book version of Bembo; and Adobe has their own
    version of Bembo. If I had to guess, I would say it's one of these that accounts
    for the differences you are seeing.

  body: "Thanks so far.\r\n\r\nNo, it can\u2019t be Dante (and certainly isn\u2019t)
    because, like I said, the book was published in 1994 (and Dante is much younger).
    For the same reason it can\u2019t be an alternate-glyph-opentype font. (I guess
    that\u2019s what you meant by Roman Alternate, Aa.) It isn\u2019t Adobe\u2019s
    Bembo either."

  body: I remember seeing a Berthold ad in the early '90s for their version of Bembo.
    One of the features that was touted was the shorter leg on the "R". There doesn't
    seem to be such a font on Berthold's site or anywhere else. I wonder if it was
    withdrawn.

    shown here is not Berthold's Bembo, because its \"f\" is as protruding as that
    of other Bembos (whereas the capital R is not as protruding).\r\n\r\nFor exact
    identification, Jan should supply a scan of italic. Even a few short italic words
    will do.\r\n"

  body: Not knowing the title and the year of first publication of the book, I can
    only surmise on the basis of the blurred scans that the book could be a reprint
    of a book printed by letterpress and typeset on a DDR (i.e. former East-German)
    linecaster. This would account for the fact that there are no kerns (see italic
    f and Roman f, italic j etc.). I suppose that Roman J and italic J (which are
    not shown on the scans) will have no kerns too, because line-casting machines
    did not have kerned letters.

    type. Linotype would have still been possible in 1983, but Linotype in West Germany
    never sold a linecaster version of Bembo.  That is the problem here. That's why
    I surmised that a East German linecaster (perhaps of Russian origin) was used
    here. There was a DDR Typoart Bembo, but I have no specimen.\r\n"
