  into a festival. Now I am in need of additional text continuing the same theme as
  a prior graphic.  I do not recall the name of this font particular font.  I added
  the degeneration to the text; obviously this is not included within the actual font.  Any
  attention to my need is appreciated.  '

  body: There are many faces that look quite alike. For starters you might wanna take
    a look at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.6184.0.0"
    target="new">FF Gothic</a>. It is quite similar in style but not identical.
