body: I've done PS autohints, but couldn't fix one thing. The font has pretty tight
  spacing and while individual glyphs hint well, they seem to merge in small sizes.
  I'd like to add more space between glyphs in small sizes (I'm thinking minimum 1px
  of space between glyphs). Is this something possible to fix in PS hinting?

  body: No, this is not something you can do in the PS hinting. It is something you
    can do with TrueType <em>in some rendering environments,</em> but increasingly
    the only way to obtain variations in spacing at particular sizes is to make separate
    fonts for those sizes with appropriately spaced glyphs.
