body: "I can not now locate the thread in which I posted the idea that we could add
  some letters borrowed from Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet to have distinctive letters
  for the unvoiced b, g, and d sounds in Chinese.\r\n\r\nAnyways, my recent studies
  of the Brahmi-derived abugidas of the East have suggested another idea to me.\r\n\r\nTibetan
  places a dot between each syllable, and it seems to me that one of the reasons Devanagari
  uses ligatures extensively is also to make the division between syllables unambiguous.\r\n\r\nI
  have been thinking of how the division between upper- and lower- case in the Latin
  alphabet could be used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nInstead of having any need for
  a virama symbol, things would work like this:\r\n\r\nSmall capitals, having no ascenders
  or descenders, would stand for consonants plus an inherent -a vowel following.\r\n\r\nSmall
  capital A would stand for the \"null\" consonant.\r\n\r\nAccents would be used to
  select other vowels - \xC1 would be e, \xC0 would be i, \xC2 would be o, and \xC4
  would be u. But while those accents would be used on consonants like K, in the case
  of A, instead of accents, \xC1 would be written as small-capital E, \xC0 would be
  written as small-capital \u0418, \xC2 would be written as small-capital O, and \xC4
  would be written as small capital U.\r\n\r\n\u0418 is used instead of I because
  small-capital I following a small-capital letter is used to form a dipthong, indicating
  a long vowel. To follow existing practice (in Devanagari, to which this would be
  essentially isomorphic) the accent goes on the I instead of the preceding letter.\r\n\r\nCapital
  letters, which always ascend, not leaving as much room for accents, would indicate
  pure consonants - thus avoiding the virama. A capital letter would be used to indicate
  the last consonant of a syllable <em>if</em> there is such a consonant after the
  vowel.\r\n\r\nAll other consonants in the syllable, whether consonants before the
  consonant immediately preceding the vowel (the small capital one) or after the vowel
  but prior to the last consonant, would be in lower case.\r\n\r\nWhere the lower-case
  letter is not sufficiently distinct from the small capital, an alternate is found;
  i.e., lower-case s could possibly be the long s.\r\n\r\nThis way, speakers of languages
  such as Tibetan, Burmese, Thai, Hindi, Gujarati... could all use the same alphabet,
  without having to change how they spell, and they would be using glyphs with (most
  of) which many of them would already be familiar.\r\n\r\nSo, basically, the alphabet
  would be like this:\r\n\r\nVowels:\r\nA(\u0905) E(\u090F) \u0418(\u0907) O(\u0913)
  U(\u0909)\r\nAI(\u0906) EI(\u0910) \u0418I(\u0908) OI(\u0914) UI(\u090A)\r\n\r\nConsonants:\r\n-
  Gutturals\r\nK(\u0915) X(\u0916) G(\u0917) \u0413(\u0918) ?(\u0919)\r\n\r\n- Palatals\r\n\u0427(\u091A)
  \u054B(\u091B) J(\u091C) \u0416(\u091D) \u0546(\u091E)\r\n\r\n- Cerebrals\r\n\u0394(\u091F)
  \u0398(\u0920) \u0534(\u0921) \xD0(\u0922) ?(\u0923)\r\n\r\n- Dentals\r\nT(\u0924)
  \xDE(\u0925) D(\u0926) \u0414(\u0927) N(\u0929)\r\n\r\n- Labials\r\nP(\u092A) \u041F(\u092B)
  B(\u092C) \u0411(\u092D) M(\u092E)\r\n\r\n- Semivowels\r\nY(\u092F) R(\u0930) L(\u0932)
  \u041B(\u0933) V(\u0935)\r\n\r\n- Sibilants\r\n\u0428(\u0936) \u0547(\u0937) S(\u0938)
  H(\u0939)\r\n\r\nTo get four kinds of N, though, since the Cyrillic N looks like
  H, I'm at a loss for what alphabets to raid. Apparently, \u0923 has changed its
  form, as I expected a slanting stroke at the bottom, starting from the first vertical
  line, not touching the other two vertical  lines (instead of looping into the second)...
  initially, I had some trouble finding all the Devanagari characters I was trying
  to match."

    Latin and Cyrillic letters to represent not the phonetics of language (transcription)
    but the graphical structure of how the language is represented in another writing
    system. Considering that there are already well established Latin alphabetic transcription
    systems for Indian languages, I wonder if trying to introduce a Latin+ abugida
    transliteration system would not simply be confusing.\r\n\r\nThere are regional
    variant forms of Devanagari letters, which might explain some of your difficulties
    identifying some characters. The Unicode charts use modern Hindi forms of the
    western variety."

  body: "My goals were more ambitious than a mere transliteration scheme.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    this is being (although not too seriously) proposed as a new script that would
    replace almost all existing writing systems.\r\n\r\nAccording to the book \"Significance
    of the Alphabet\", by Charles Kraitsir, \"The D\u0113va n\u0101gari is the only
    scheme of writing perfectly adapted to represent to the eye the Indo-European
    tongues.\"\r\n\r\nWell, English is an Indo-European tongue. So, with this abugida,
    English can be written, effectively, in Devanagari, without its speakers having
    to learn a whole new alphabet which would be less legible to them.\r\n\r\nAnd
    because of the dominance of English, many people in the languages using abugidas
    derived from the Brahmi are familiar with Latin letters. Right now, Thai, Burmese,
    Lao, Tibetan, Hindi, Tamil, and so on... while they are written either in Devanagari
    or systems essentially isomorphic to it, they are written in a wide variety of
    different alphabets.\r\n\r\nIf, instead, they all used the same alphabet, then
    they could all take advantage of the great quantity of type design work done for
    European alphabets (although throwing in a few Armenian letters somewhat weakens
    this argument), and one obstacle to communication between those nations would
    be removed."

  body: "Well, I'll agree that one person praising Devanagari in that fashion doesn't
    prove anything. His complaint about our alphabet was that in English and French,
    because it doesn't have enough letters, combinations like th and sh are needed
    to make up the deficiency... and in Polish, sometimes the very same letter needs
    more than one different accent mark! (French has both acute and grave accents
    on the e, but perhaps following Devanagari, he was only worried about the consonants.)\r\n\r\nDevanagari,
    on the other hand, had enough letters to follow the rule of one letter per sound!
    Thus, why invent something artificial, like the Shaw Alphabet, when the natural
    genius of mankind has already created a phonetic alphabet ready for use."

  body: "Now I see, though, that the idea posed in the earlier thread is (almost)
    superfluous. In researching additional data to satisfy the curiosity I would have
    piqued by adding pictures of old typewriter arrangements to my web site, I have
    found that one doesn't have to go to Sanskrit and its related abugidas... there
    is one existing alphabetic script that has three letters instead of two where
    the Latin alphabet has (b,p) or (g,k) or (d,t), thus representing voiced b, g,
    and d, plosive p, k, and t, and the unvoiced but not plosive letters found in
    Chinese.\r\n\r\nAt least in its Eastern and Classical pronounciations. The Western
    version has two consonant sounds in each group, not three, and so two of the three
    letters in each group sound the same.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, unlike Greek and Cyrillic,
    for example, the letter forms are <em>very</em> unfamiliar to Latin-alphabet users.
    Thus, while lowercase h looks the same (when it's not written as a sort of zig-zag
    line) and O actually stands for O, but (uppercase) S stands for t, and too much
    else doesn't even begin to suggest a sound... and so I don't think it will be
    possible to persuade speakers of English, French, Spanish, and so on to switch
    to this alphabet simply so that they can now unambiguously and correctly transliterate
    Chinese.\r\n\r\nOf course, this reminds me of an old H\xE4gar the Horrible cartoon,
    in which the title character responds to the statement \"We will never have peace
    on Earth until all men learn to understand each other!\" - he responds, in one
    panel, \"True...\"\r\n\r\nand then in the final panel, asks \"But how are we going
    to get everyone to speak Norwegian?\"."

    kinda weird. Devanagari can't even represent Hindi without diacritics: nuqta.
    The Indo-European languages have such divergent phonologies that what works for
    Sanskrit isn't going to be good for much else.  I'd love to see the Devanagari
    ligature for words like \"sixths\" Russian \"\u0432\u0437\u0433\u043B\u044F\u0434\".
    Whenever you see the words \"perfectly\" and \"writing\" in the same sentence,
    beware.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using Greek letters in Latin script is not without
    precedent. Bruyas used \u03B8 and \u03C7 to represent [th] and [kh] in Mohawk,
    distinguishing them from the other allophones of /t/ and /k/. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>speakers

    Armenian alphabet because it's better suited to transliterating the Wu (Shanghai
    and related dialects) dialect of Chinese, or for the Brahmi-script users to switch
    to something Latin-based to suit foreigners... yes, neither is likely to happen.
    But for at least some purposes, such as new scripts for indigenous people adopting
    the Latin alphabet, it would be nice for the Latin alphabet to have a few extra
    standardized letters - so that the same letter would be used to express the same
    non-English sound in those languages that use it, for example."
