  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/restraint_example_6362.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst
  a font to match the mono-linear loopy feel of the ornamental stuff. Right now I
  am using [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo-script/|Estilo Script]] and
  I am more or less happy with that, but I am wondering if there are any better options
  out there. It could be either sans serif or script.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/estiloscript-example_4566.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond,
  a font that feels similar to the letters in Restraint. I am not looking for an exact
  match, just something similar in weight and structure. Spiky serifs would be nice
  too.\r\n\r\nAny ideas are appreciated."

    consider:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/diego/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-newtext/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-serif-gothic/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    when choosing the two fonts, it would be nice if they looked like they belong
    together (although you might -possibly rightly- be counting on Restraint to act
    as a glue). This might be more important than making two independent good selections.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    perfectly suited to the need for which it was intended. I must admit, looking
    back there are some things that need to be fixed. Besides which, there is at least
    one other Copper Plate Gothic with a lower case: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/american-gothic/|American

  body: 'No insult taken. It''s just fun to pull your leg. Just so that you know,
    Copper Penny was designed for usage on signs. The weight and heavier serifs aren''t
    destroyed during routing, sand blasting or vinyl applications. Most versions of
    Copperplate Gothic don''t work very well for the sign industry because of weak
    serifs. This wouldn''t be an issue except it is a very popular font for architectural
    signs. '
