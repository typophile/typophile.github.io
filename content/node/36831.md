  called Darjeeling Limited. But this time Wes (or his team of creatives) have opted
  to not use Futura as their font. What is this mysterious font? The font seems to
  perfectly fit with the movie. The movie takes place in India and in India, I have
  noticed, they use western design and art but with a slight Indian remix, and the
  font of  Darjeeling Limited does that exactly. Its really nice to see an artist
  like Wes Andersson have such great understanding of graphic design and typography.
  Much like another master of film known for his 2001 Odysseus.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/thedarjeelinglimited/\r\n\r\n"

    I do get the sense that ever aspect of Wes Anderson's work is so thought through
    that there is nothing organic left. \r\n\r\nI keep hoping Jason Schwartzman will
    have a larger personality. I didn't really like the character he played in Marie
    Antoinette. I get the feeling he didn't have to try very hard to fill those shoes.
    Or maybe he is such a great actor that he can do that. Either way that movie blew.
    I was soooooo disappointed. Sorry, I hope I've not derailed the thread. I can't
    imagine he can stand up next to Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody.\r\n\r\n"

    out more, Claire Danes with Steve Martin or with that little rodent. I was eating
    brunch once in NY and Schwartzman and his girlfriend were leaning against the
    window, literally 3 feet away from me, sucking face. It was kinda hard to eat.\r\n\r\nI
    liked Anderson's first movie, Bottle Rocket, a lot but he has steadily lost me
    - absolutely hated Tennenbaums and couldn't bring myself to see the fish movie.
    \r\n\r\nMore thread derailing, sorry. \r\n\r\nThe G on that poster led me to Nobel,
    but other characters don't match, so I dunno what font we're looking at."

    think he's even close. Futura was widely acknowledged as Stanley Kubrick's 'favourite'
    typeface even though he used a wide variety of typefaces in his films and posters
    etc. Kubrick is beyond Wes Anderson in creativity and technical imagination. \r\n\r\nMy
    first impression of the poster/cover of Darjeeling Limited is that it's basically
    identical to 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou', they both use Futura... and
    the same color palette. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong I thought the The Royal Tenenbaums
    was hilarious, but didn't he use Futura on the cover for that too?"

    not. But as an artist, you certainly know when you're watching one of Wes's films.
    At the very least, he's a unique story teller on film.\r\n\r\nAnd, like a lot
    of great artists, you either love the work or despise it. "

    was appropriate for the part... but my wife disliked that movie and I must say
    I understand why. I don't even know why I liked it, but I did!\r\n\r\nMore trivia:
    The production designer for the Wes Anderson movies up through Tenenbaums was
    David Wasco, the brother of Monotype's (and previously Adobe's) Jim Wasco. David
    Wasco has a great resume, having done production design for all of Quentin Tarantino's
    movies too."

  body: "^^ Did not know about the David Wasco connection, thanks. Makes sense given
    that in Andersson movies there is good understanding for type, especially Futura.
    Every single sing in that movie is set in Futura, whether its the taxi company
    name on the side of a car or a bottle of milk, I have never heard any movie do
    that. And that perfectly is one piece of creating a world, which Wes Andersson
    does with Tennenbaums, he creates an imaginary world. \r\n\r\nI love Andersson
    movies because they are so visually stimulating, much like a Jean Pierre Jeunet
    or Michael Gondry movie is. Plus Wes Andersson movie have a unique humor to them.
    \r\n\r\nI first didnt actually like his movies but one it clicked and noticed
    the genius. Im not saying his as great as Kubrick but hes on his way up there."

    the powell-pressburger.org site has a framegrab of the Royal Tenenbaums opening
    title (scroll way down) with a comment that Wes Anderson was influenced by Powell
    and Pressburger's film The Red Shoes, which led me to wonder if his Futura obsession
    could have come from another Michael Powell film, Age of Consent? \r\n\r\nThe
    opening titles for Age of Consent can be seen <A HREF=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UajLbD6IoZI&mode=related&search=\">here</A>.

    Wes's work isn't your thing. ;o)\r\n\r\nHis movies are definitely about a 'feel'
    more than anything, with character development being second. Plot is rarely that
    important, it seems. It's a feel I enjoy, but I can see how it's not for everyone."

    did not see \"The Royal Tennenbaums\" on the big screen, and so I did not notice

    Or maybe I was too busy paying attention to the story, the characters, etc. I
    have to agree with Patty that doing something like that (in a movie) seems a bit
    precious. There are many ways of creating a unique world in a movie that are way
    more noticeable than this -- through lighting, color, props, etc. -- just my opinion."

    handmade object as apt to win affection as to provoke annoyance.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    sounds like it could apply to any Wes Anderson film -- meaning I will probably
    like it, and Patty won't. (But of course Patty should just pass on it and let
    the rest of us enjoy ourselves.)\r\n\r\nThe short film, \"Hotel Chevalier,\" is
    now downloadable for free from iTunes. Wes Anderson fans will like it. :-)"
