  thought I\u2019d put together my own list of demands for President O\u2026\r\n\r\n1.\tNationalize
  Gotham \u2013 and make it available to all citizens (and legal resident aliens)
  free of charge.\r\n\r\n2.\tEstablish annual award for outstanding typographic contributions
  to the USA \u2013 first recipient,  Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\n3.\tEconomic bail out
  for the font industry \u2013 a fat check for every practicing typeface designer.\r\n\r\n4.\tAnnex
  Vancouver Island, making Hudson, Bringhurst, Mills and Bantjes subjects of Obama-rule.\r\n\r\n5.\tFour
  year moratorium on the use of Optima.\r\n\r\n6.\tRedesign all government web sites
  and tax forms using the ecofont. \r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest others as ten item
  lists seem to be best. \r\n"

    will be given to the designer who has demanded the most attention for a design
    that raises awareness of a a cause-celebre but in no way actually helps anyone.
    Designs produced for any cause not favored by people self-identify as liberal
    are ineligible for this award.\r\n\r\nRequire Adobe to start releasing bug fixes
    again.\r\n\r\nMandate certification of typographic competence for anyone who subtitles
    or develops captioning systems for movies and television. \r\n\r\nGet MSNBC to
    stop using all caps tracked to -150 so that \u201CHILLARY CLINTON\u201D no longer
    reads \u201CHILLARY CUNTON\u201D. Seriously, her name ends up onscreen at least
    once every hour, this needs to be fixed."

  body: Within the first few hours of the presidency, Obama relaunched the [[http://whitehouse.gov
    | White House]] site. Can't ask for more efficiency than that and I take it as
    a small sign of good things to come. The site is typographically about 3 steps
    up from the old website, with a nice mixture of branding elements from his campaign
    and a dose of Government sincerity. It even [[http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://www.whitehouse.gov/
    | validates]] (though it's using a good deal of unsemantic markup).
