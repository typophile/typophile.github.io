body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'd like to change the underline thickness in a compiled
  OT font automatically, since the AFDKO seems to have no keywords for this.\r\nMy
  tool of choice is fontTools.\r\n\r\nWhen decompiling the font to XML via ttx, this
  is setting that at least InDesign reads the value from:\r\n<code>\r\n&lt;CFF>\r\n
  \ &lt;CFFFont name=\"Antithesis-Regular\">\r\n    &lt;UnderlineThickness value=\"90\"/>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nHow
  to reach this setting via Python+fontTools?\r\nI've come as far as this:\r\n<code>\r\nttf
  = TTFont(path)\r\nttf['CFF '].cff\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnt now what? I can't find out
  how to reach the said setting.\r\nThank you."

    python session that was still open.\r\n\r\nBut when I run this as a script from
    the beginning, unfortunately I can\u2019t reproduce this funtionality.\r\nThen,
    <code>ttf['CFF '].cff.topDictIndex.items[0]</code> is <code>None</code>, and therefore
    also has no attributes.\r\nThere must be some intermediate step to load/decompile
    something that I unknowingly typed and now can't reproduce. And now that previous
    session is gone, so I can't look up the steps that I made.\r\nI tried to load
    just <code>ttf['CFF ']</code> into a variable, to no effect.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: Using DTL OTM Light I see, for ArnoPro-Regular.otf version 1.000, a value
    of -100 for float UnderlinePosition in the CFF table and the comment is "Underline
    stroke center y coordinate"; I see nothing similar in the ttx output. I also see
    in the post table, with DTL OTM Light, a value of -75 for FWORD underlinePosition
    with comment "Distance top of underline from baseline (negative = below baseline)".
    Is the value in the CFF table a calculated value derived from other parameters?

    the first four values, which is a shame. &nbsp; [yanone]\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe
    fact is that FontForge cares about those values but 'underlinePosition' is interpreted
    differently. Here is the correspondence \r\n<pre>\r\nimport fontforge\r\nf=fontforge.open(path)\r\nf.os2_strikeypos
    \    % ttf['OS/2'].yStrikeoutPosition\r\nf.os2_strikeysize    % ttf['OS/2'].yStrikeoutSize\r\nf.uwidth
    \            % ttf['post'].underlineThickness\r\n</pre>\r\nThe additional parameter
    handled by FontForge and corresponding to [Uu]nderlinePosition (I did not look
    at the source, I just experimented with values), is\r\n<pre>\r\nf.upos   % ttf['post'].underlinePosition
    + ttf['post'].underlineThickness/2\r\n</pre>\r\nin the cases I have tested (and
    the updates are correctly made with that interpretation). The interpretation of
    the Microsoft spec above may not, indeed, be crystal clear. The value of f.upos
    given by FontForge for ArnoPro-Regular.otf is neither -100 nor -75 but -50. (I
    am running the July 2012 version)"
