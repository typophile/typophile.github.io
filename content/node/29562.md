  body: "I'd say Avenir has too small of an x-height to work as text, but then again,
    I've never tried setting text in Avenir.\r\n\r\nAnyway, how about something like
    the bold weight of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.117505.0.0\"
    target=\"_blank\">Iridium</a> also by Adrian Frutiger?\r\n\r\nIn the sans-serif
    category, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=MSF.118749.0.0\"
    target=\"_blank\">Mostra</a> by Mark Simonson or the Titling weight of <a href=\"http://houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfonts\"
    target=\"_blank\">Neutraface</a> might work, depending on how bold your Avenir
    headings are.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "It's ok to use Avenir for longer text matter, I think. At least, I have done
    that a few times ; ). Mind that you use a fair amount of leading and that you
    check the basic kerning (the lighter faces need more than is built\u2013in\u2026).
    \r\n\r\nBTW You can't go wrong if you combine it with a Frutigerdesigned serif.
    There is something very consistent in Mr F's designs. That may have to do with
    his exeptional drawing skills and his great knowledge of signs (he wrote about
    signs \u2014 a fascinating book: Der Mensch und seine Zeichen)."

    with <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1313/pmncaecilia-family.html\">Caecillia</a>
    for text. On occasion, I would swap the two for variety, or use the sans (Avenir)
    for sidebar articles.\r\n\r\nLex -- I hadn't seen Iridium before. I like it!"
