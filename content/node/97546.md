body: "Hi\r\n\r\nThe last time I created a font it was on an Amiga, so please understand
  I'm not fully up to speed with Ascent / Descent / Line Gap etc.\r\n\r\nI need to
  create TTF versions (iOS compatible for iPhone & iPad) of pre-existing fonts but
  with adjusted 'line spacing' so that when displayed the fonts will appear to have
  a line spacing that differs from 1.0.  So I'll start with 'arial.ttf' and end up
  with 'arial_linespace_large.ttf' for example. Yes I know it's a hack but when working
  on iOS software you get used to these sort of hacks.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming I can do
  this using a tool such as FontLab? Is this 'simple' enough that a more basic package
  will do just as good a job? Mac software would be idea, PC I can do too.\r\n\r\nCan
  someone either point me in the direction of what settings I need to adjust to create
  \ font variations like this? Or point me in the direction of where I should go to
  learn this? I posted here as it looked like an active forum, but if there's better
  places to ask this sort of thing I'm happy to move.\r\n\r\nI want to test out this
  ASAP to check it'll work in practice as while this is all due to an apple bug where
  they 'forget' line spacing settings if you set the font value (crazy but true).\r\n\r\nAnyone
  generous enough to help steer me in the right direction?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nJen"

    this kind of modification. You mention Arial, and I think you will find that this
    kind of modification is prohibited by the license agreement.\r\n\r\nIf you have
    a license that does permit this kind of modification, and this is the only thing
    you need to do, you don't need a full font tool such as FontLab, but only a table
    editor. You will need to adjust the OS/2 and hhea table vertical metrics settings.
    You can do it for free using the TTX dump/fuse tool, or can pay for a tool with
    an easy user interface such as DTL OTMaster.\r\n\r\n"

    up having to settle for? I for one will never get over it.\r\n\r\nConcerning modifying
    fonts, at the risk of riling John -and others- I would state my own position,
    as a type designer who wants to account for our collective debt to precedent:
    feel free to modify fonts you've acquired legitimately <em>as long as you make
    sure they don't end up in the hands of others;</em> if they do, be willing to
    pay the price.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, what does 'acquired legitimately' mean other than acquired under the
    terms of the license agreement of the legitimate licensor of the font? Your comment
    doesn't 'rile' me, I just think you shouldn't go around encouraging other people
    to actions that may result in legal difficulties.

  body: "Clever with the \"legitimate\" angle. I guess what I'm saying is people should
    have the strength to violate things they consider unjust, but remain prepared
    to pay for possible consequences. Of course people shouldn't take legal advice
    from a type designer (often they shouldn't take it from a lawyer either...) and
    anybody who doesn't consider a no-mod clause unjust would feel no compulsion to
    violate it.\r\n\r\nDon't do something because you think you can get away with
    it; do something because you believe in it whether you might get away with it
    or not.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    about glitz\u2026"
