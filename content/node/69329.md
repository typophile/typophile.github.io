  which I have decided to use Mrs. Eaves. I am required to choose a companion typeface,
  which must be a sans-serif. Since Mrs. Eaves has so much personality, I can't seem
  to find one that fits just right. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: Hehe, I did consider Mr. Eaves, but perhaps I should have said that I'm looking
    for something which CONTRASTS well with Mrs. Eaves.

  body: "Contrast can be many things. Mr. Eaves share his Mrs\u2019 skeleton, but
    his monolinear body doesn\u2019t sport her ladylike features (the thicks and thins).
    That is one of the most common contrasts used nowadays, the principle most superfamilies
    follow.\r\n\r\nYou can also have contrast angle (cursive), in size (small text
    sizes vs. large display sizes), and in weight: Perhaps Mr. Eaves enjoys a good
    hot dog or a tasty hamburger. Well, why not let him gain some pounds? "

  body: "Contrast, not enough.\r\nLook for both counterpoint and harmony, to use musical
    terms.\r\nChoosing a sans is counterpoint enough, certainly if you contrast weight
    as well.\r\nFor harmony, it seems that a sans with a small x-height, a noticeable
    difference in stem width between cap and lower case, vertical stress (i.e. not
    oldstyle/humanist), and ascenders that do not extend above cap height, would complement
    Mrs Eaves. Such as my <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins
    Sans</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
