  <BR>As for me I like the sign , and the customer agreed with it, but it seems to
  me that maybe something wrong with the letters...or anything else??? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64948.gif"

  body: Ivan, <BR>I hope you plan on keeping the mark rough like it currently is.
    I like it a lot. That rough look doesn&#39;t transfer to the type very well. You
    will have some problems with legibility when the logo is made smaller because
    the mark is so big compaired to the type. <BR> <BR>Nice work.
