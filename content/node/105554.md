  body: "\"SHOP...\" looks like <strong>Comix Regular</strong> from WSI-Font Collection
    (1993).\r\nNote thought, that WSI is a well known font forgery corporation that
    was shut down and the font above is probably published without authorization of
    the original font designer. You can find more info on the subject here:\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/wsi.pdf"

  body: "I concur in your find.\r\nSo, how legitimate is WSI's Comix Regular?\r\nI
    flipped though the Comicraft and Blambot collections but did not spot a match.
    But perhaps on closer examination? Another comic book/strip font publisher?\r\nHere
    is internal font info:\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFont Name
    : Comix Regular\r\nFont ID : 1865\r\nFamily Name : Comix\r\nSub Family Name: Regular\r\nVersion
    : Publisher's Paradise -- Media Graphics International Inc.\r\nPostScript Name
    : ComixRegular\r\nFont Type : True Type\r\nCopyright : From the WSI-Font Collection.
    Copyright (c)1993 W.S.I. All Rights Reserved. \r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs
    for \"School Spirit\" it's the overused Comic Sans, which is installed as a core
    font on Microsoft windows.\r\n\r\nBy the way if you want an alternative to Comic
    Sans, you might try Comicraft's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/soliloquous/\">Soliloquous</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/comicrazy/\">Comicrazy</a>,

    -- WSI has a very bad track record. However, they apparently did a few originals
