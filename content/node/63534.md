  that create type.\r\n\r\nWhat do you then call sites like dafont, fontsquirrel (sites
  that list free fonts etc).\r\n\r\nFree font library?\r\n\r\nIs there a more official
  name for these types of sites?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help would be sweet."

    font sites. Some more curated than others. Dafont's useful to useless ratio is
    something like 1/1000\r\n"

    Free fonts from dafont are are overpriced."

  body: "DaFont is actually incredibly useful when I'm doing a personal (non-paying)
    job and need a display font to fit a specific era or style, like Art Deco, grunge,
    hand-drawn, etc. I can usually find something close enough to what I'm looking
    for, and then I can manually kern when I place it in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I'm really tired of seeing people using Sketch Rockwell everywhere."

  body: There is nothing wrong if someone wants to design a font for free. The problem
    is a lot of the fonts on sites like this tend to be blatant copies of proper type
    designers hard work. Yesterday Fontsmith had to contact the lawyers at Channel
    4 regarding a rip off of the Channel 4 type face we designed for them. The font
    were removed, but it is hard to police stuff like this.

    true! (And I say this in spite of the fact that they have links to two of my FontStruct
    fonts. FontStructions are free, but they could have asked me beforehand if it
    was okay to list them on DaFont. *Sigh*...)\r\n"

  body: "dafont is very useful and contains much better typefaces that 99% of all
    the other free font websites; i'm using it quite often, when i'm in need of a
    very specific titling font for a packaging project (and i do packaging all year
    long) that doesn't require a perfect kerning. when i can't find what i need in
    quality foundries such as sudtipos or fontdiner, when hubert jocham is unavailable,
    dafont is very handy, even though full of problems (one of them being the big
    amount of ripoffs, even if they seem to be removed quite fast). to name dafont
    the 'root of all evil' is a bitter (some bad experience?) and rather stupid comment,
    in my opinion. I don't know fontsquirrel.\r\n\r\nthis being said, i second drdoc's
    comment on rockwell sketch :-)\r\n\r\ndr"
