body: "I am trying to identify a font, identifont and whatthefont have been unsuccessful
  in identifying it.  It appears to be a mono-spaced san serif font.  The unique characteristic
  that I am unable to match is a capital W with vertical sides that is a mirror image
  of the capital M.  Other characteristics: \r\nThe capital A has angled sides but
  may have a small flat portion where the two side bars meet.  \r\nThe number 4 is
  open.\r\nThe number zero is slightly more oval and narrower than the capital O\r\nThe
  capital B (not shown) has a slightly smaller upper loop than the lower loop.  \r\nThe
  apostrophe (not shown) is symmetrical around the vertical axis and is wedge shaped.\r\nNone
  of the capital letters extend below the base line.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT
