  of typography and the future.\r\n\r\nFilms; Hollywood ones in particular, make projections
  from time to time on how the world might look in the future (eg. Minority Report)\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of similar exercises with type. \r\n\r\nI know of all those typefaces
  that were inspired by 60s and 70s sci-fi. But anything that draws from more recent
  paradigms in science/technology? Ideas more evolved than say Blur or the many pixel-fonts."

  body: "I get the impression that futurism in the visual creative fields is sort
    of fading out in the same way it has done so in science fiction. So many of the
    twentieth century\u2019s preconceptions of the future just turned out to be dead
    wrong because people imagined the twenty-first century all of the wrong: genetically
    engineered people flying through space staring at CRT screens and only important
    people had anything resembling a cell phone. I think that the same sort of holds
    true of futurism and type; people assumed that type would reflect computers of
    the time, instead type fit to computers has become anachronism and all the old
    notions of type are being revived. I expect that in a few more decades screen
    resolution will have increased pretty dramatically (e-readers are already in the
    120-160 dpi range) and there may not be any reason for type to have strayed too
    far from the path its on now.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that there are futurist tendencies
    in the orthographic reforms proposed by Bayer and Crouwell, but that could simply
    be an impression ingrained in our minds by the people who used those types to
    seem futuristic because they were unfamiliar. "

  body: "That's quite a comforting vision, James :) I think I agree with most of what
    you say.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was quite keen to know what people here thought about
    this, I was in fact holding back from making this a type-futurism question thinking
    that it would appear somewhat pointless to many.\r\n\r\nCan't say I'm familiar
    with the 'orthographic reforms proposed by Bayer and Crouwell'. Will look it up.
    Thanks for mentioning.  "
