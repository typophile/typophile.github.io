  body: "The font is called \"England's Heartbreak\" :-(\r\n\r\nSeriously Nike's designers
    apparently customized each shirt's design and typography to reflect each team's
    national identity - searching one of the news aggregators for some keywords around
    this should result in some articles.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si (still crying in my beer)

  body: Italy's jerseys are set in Puma Pace, designed by Dalton Maag, Ltd. in London,
    exclusively for Puma. I do not believe that it is possible to get the font at
    all, unless perhaps you work for Puma or Dalton Maag ;-)

    it's proprietary to Nike and I can't share the font or the number sets. The number
    sets were all custom drawn and exist in multiple fonts but they didn't come from
    any single font."
