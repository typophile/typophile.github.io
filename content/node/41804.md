  column wraps differently. (\"speculate\" should be flush left rather than wrapping,
  etc.)\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to fix it? Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/indesignissue_6693.png]"

    Shape>Rectangle. Then try the same with the text frame. Check to make sure neither
    is rotated.\r\n\r\nI assume you alright made sure everything is styled the same.
    Is there some kind of baseline grid align going on?"

  body: "Ehague,\r\n\r\nThe objects are rectangles and neither is rotated. No grid.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I move the image box to the center of the columns so text flows to either side,
    the problem goes away. As I move the box toward any one column's edge, the text
    pops down.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?"
