  body: hmmm, unless someone created a customized font, it doesn't look like a spontaneous
    scribbling when i look at the repeating characters.

    cut and paste to make the words IMHO

    come close to the example posted in the first posting?

  body: "I think this looks like a custom font. I checked the Indie Font books, the
    Fonthead collection, Device fonts, the House General Collection and a few other
    places where I thought the design might fit, but found no exact matches. Like
    the ever-popular hand-printed lettering fonts, a font like this would be very
    easy to create, and since it is used for product branding, the odds that it is
    custom seem high to me.\r\n\r\nSome of the other Holland Fonts, besides Bfrika
    that Tim mentioned, are also similar to this style, if you would accept 'similar'.\r\n\r\n-
