  to announce the release of Etica, a strong yet delicate sans serif.\r\n\r\nEtica,
  the-moralist-typefamily-project, was born at the end of 2000, but its development
  is ongoing, overcoming many hurdles and diversions. On one hand, the original idea
  was spurred by a certain esteem for Helvetica, in particular, its strength and versatility,
  and on the other, an intolerance to its plenty but inadequate applications; created
  by those who erroneously consider it to be a neutral and timeless design.\r\n\r\nWe
  believe that Helvetica is a beautiful typeface, but very deeply rooted in its own
  era. It is often unsuitably used in contexts that have changed profoundly since
  its birth. From this initial intention, we coined the ironic payoff \u2018The-Moralist-Typeface\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe
  challenge was to obtain the same force, versatility and colour that are, from our
  point of view, Helvetica\u2019s greatest qualities. The same proportions have been
  maintained, albeit with slightly reduced letter width. The resulting design has
  soft strokes, open counters and terminals; aesthetically resting somewhere between
  a grotesque and humanist sans serif. It successfully combines masculine force with
  female delicacy.\r\n\r\nEtica\u2019s wide range of styles, together with a large
  character set and OpenType features, such as 4 sets of numerals,\r\nfractions, several
  stylistic alternates and a set of arrows and dingbats, allows for a vast variety
  of applications, be they editorial or corporate.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.type-together.com/Etica\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5117.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_5013.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_5283.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_4497.jpg]"
