  a little project I'm working on and I'd really love some critique to help me improve.\r\n\r\nHere's
  the link [[http://typeandmusic.com/articles/measure.html|to the work in question]].
  I'd just like to get another set of eyes to look over it and make sure I'm not making
  any blindingly obvious mistakes.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Is this the real content? I'm not sure what you mean by content mockup. Are
    you requesting criticism of the writing?

      The Elements of Typographic Style, in my own words.\r\n\r\nI'm more interested
      in feedback on the general composition and styling of the content, in case I've
      made any silly typographic errors.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply!"

    & Music\xBB looks odd centered when the other text on orange is asymmetric. I
    don\u2019t think quotes (Bringhurst) should have as much spacing between them
    as the subheads have before them. It makes the quote look too separate from the
    enclosing paragraphs it\u2019s in context of."
