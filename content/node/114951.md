  I searched for a while without coming up with any answers.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if someone could help me find a good, readable sans-serif font that would flow nicely
  when inserted into body text that is composed of Adobe Garamond. Something with
  the same proportions so as not to cause any weird leading issues.\r\n\r\nAny help
  is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nChris"

  body: I've matched Adobe Garamond with Seria Sans, as well as (maybe less successfully)
    Myriad.

  body: "May I suggest my own Proza? It was initially intended as a sans-serif companion
    to Garamond, and still shares its humanist skeleton. You can read all about it
    here: http://ilovetypography.com/2013/11/01/making-fonts-proza-typeface/\r\n\r\nFor
    similar proportions you might try this: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/jannon-sans/\r\nIt's
    based on Jannon, rather than Garamond, but it's probably the closest of a match
    you'll find.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
