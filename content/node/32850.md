body: Okay, so i know [[Relato Sans]] is a TDC winner and all, and it's currently
  on special at myfonts.com, but i'm not sure if i should spring for it. i love the
  roman fonts, but the italics are a little out there for me. can any of you sway
  me one way or the other on whether or not i should scoop this one up?

  body: I don't like the italics. The roman is nice but for me not special enough
    - I have other fonts that could fit the same bill. But the italics would be a
    deal breaker.

    the italics is a bit odd...the spacing is off and the various angles make you
    a bit woosy when reading it. Unique, though. So, for that alone, I have to give
    it some points."

  body: "Paul let me try to sway you. ;^)\r\n\r\nThink of Dwiggins's M-Formula when
    you consider the italics. At smaller sizes it will be just interesting enough
    to be original and when you use it at display sizes it will be an entirely new
    font. Relato's italics, for me, are a lot of what I would consider the reason
    to license it. Where the roman is nice, I have many other fonts in my library
    which are similar enough that I couldn't rationalize the license. However, those
    italics! They remind me of the italics that [[John Downer]] designed for <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=141\">Triplex</a>.
    Don't shy away from something because it doesn't appear to be the norm. \r\n\r\nAlthough,
    I don't see a double-f ligature! So that might be a reason for me not to license
    it. ;^)"

    it either: I agree with Patty that it lacks a distinctive-enough hook to make
    me want to add it to my collection.  \r\n\r\nThat's part of the problem, I guess,
    with freelancing -- it takes more than being just a pretty face to get bought."

    how well they paid attention to details.\r\n\r\n*Maybe not most difficult, but
    you'd be surprise how many great typefaces fail to do a good job with them."

  body: "For me Relato Sans is a mix of Mundo Sans (and similar types), Klavika, and
    let say 'informational' dutch sans types.\r\n\r\nI have to disagree with the comments
    about the roman- perhaps the tone of its not serious enough for certain jobs but
    it is special. The hyper-modulation in the italics are not distracting (nor apparent)
    at book sizes. But like Tiff says... enlarge them and you have something new and
    very funky. And that goes for the roman too. \r\n\r\nThe small caps look to die
    for!!!\r\n\r\nThe Absara family has bony less friendly feel. And I don't like
    serif in print.\r\n\r\nI also would like to see more ligatures added to this family-
    as well as Bohemia!!!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: I feel like Manso's technique is sound and the quality of the type isn't questionable,
    so it's down to your personal opinion. Print it at various sizes and see how you
    feel. Compare it to other faces you're considering, or what might already be in
    your library.

    on all levels. Use the Italic by itself or use the Bold Caps by itself or use
    just the Roman Sans and it stands by itself. Use them together and you have text
    system full of personality and options.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: I'm surprised no-one, except SuperUltraFabulous, mentioned the bold, which
    is beautifully emphatic. One of the reasons I bought Relato Serif was for the
    superb bold (plus it was also on the same ridiculously cheap deal at MyFonts a
    couple of months back:-). I'm certainly going to scoop up some Relato Sans faces
    at these prices! Plus, I would presume it will set more or less identically to
    the Serif, in which case it's a very economical font, almost identical to Myriad.
