body: "I need to set an academic manuscript in Latex.  In addition to the typefaces
  provided by latex, sabon and albertina are also available. The text contains some
  dates and figures in the body text, but not too many. On the other hand, it contains
  about a thousand legal footnotes which all contain numbers, e.g.:\r\n\r\n120.    Compare
  23 US 1380 (1974); (2004) 69 Harv. L.J. 28 at 65 (text)\r\n\r\nMy question is this:
  oldstyle figures blend well with the text, but not with the footnote text because
  of the many capital letters. So what style figures to use? Oldstyle for the main
  text and lining for footnotes? Lining for both? \r\n\r\nwhat's your advice?"

    lining figures only in the legal citations, leaving osfs for the dates and footnote
    indices, like this: (bold=lining)\r\n\r\n120. Compare <strong>23</strong> US <strong>1380</strong>
    (1974); (2004) <strong>69</strong> Harv. L.J. <strong>28</strong> at <strong>65</strong>\r\n\r\n(by
    the way, though, this method would drive the production people <em>insane</em>.

  body: "hehe well try the systems you think make sense, then decide how badly you
    want <em>not</em> to apply character styles over and over again.\r\n\r\n(Nested
    styles could get the indices as osfs and the rest of the footnotes as lining)"
