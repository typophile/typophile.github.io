		<div class="commentbody">Hopefully this will change in the near future. I know that at least one book publisher is working on a subsidized ebook reader because printing costs are so high and so many books lose money. Now that Amazon is planning to use cheap ebooks as a loss leader and bring in money with subscriptions to other content I expect to see more publishers jump on board. If we suddenly have competing cabals of companies that actually understand typography all trying to best Amazon and each other we’ll hopefully see better ebook typography, and maybe some really great typefaces commissioned for ebook screens.</div>

<p>not entirely true.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m here specifically as an e-book programmer who
is soliciting feedback on a wide variety of issues&hellip;</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t say you guys are using the opportunity wisely,
not so far anyway, but i am nothing if not persistent.</p>
<p>as to the particular matter of type &ndash; that is <em>fonts</em> &ndash;
the wired article misses the point in a substantial way&hellip;</p>
<p>one of the primary tenants of e-book philosophy is that
the end-user should have control over the fonts used&hellip;
so the investment of a lot of design considerations over
that particular aspect of the typography would be wasted.
the very same situation applies, of course, to web-pages.</p>
<p>this applies to some other typographical aspects as well&hellip;
should the text be justified or ragged-right?  user decides.
how tight should the leading be?  however the user likes it.
how big are the margins? as big as the user wants &lsquo;em to be.</p>
<p>the challenge to an e-book programmer, thus, becomes how
to offer the end-user the options in an easy-to-use interface,
and how to best present a display based on the user&rsquo;s choices.</p>
<p>this requires a <em>sensitivity</em> to the practices of the typographer,
an awareness that i am continuously attempting to cultivate&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not so concerned about the choice of types as I am by the lack of sensible H&amp;J schemes in e-books. Maybe it has been solved since I last read a book on Kindle in November. But that was for me the most jolting part of the experience. Perhaps for any text there will be an optimum size that allows for good H&amp;J for that text. But when the type size is adjusted for individual eyes or reading conditions, any optimum goes away.</p>
<p>Displaying Kindle texts as FL/RR won&rsquo;t help this. There will still be far too many instances in which the machine cannot handle hyphenation, and will throw unsightly white space where it ain&rsquo;t supposed to be.</p>
<p>Figure this out and I&rsquo;ll be more likely to buy an e-book device. Well, figure out the economy so I can afford one, too. Right now the library wins out, hands-down.</p>

<p>in some cases, that will affect the number of lines used

<p>i&rsquo;m sorry if it hurts your feelings.  but users want the control.
when the choice becomes your design versus their preferences,
their preferences win out.  and it&rsquo;s not even much of a contest&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to think, &ldquo;Oh well, it would have been a neat idea, but I’d 
better leave it out because it wouldn’t work in the e-book.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>actually, e-books offer authors the chance to include all kinds of
stuff that doesn&rsquo;t work in print, including audio and video content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things ranging from the Mouse’s Tail in Alice in Wonderland 
to the nice little black boxes indicating the game clues in 
Prisoner of Trebekistan would simply start disappearing
from the art of literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>not really.  illustrations are still viable.  indeed, e-books make it
much easier, on the publishing end, to include lots of illustrations.
and if .svg takes on, even text-based illustrations will be simple&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E-books will never be an adequate substitute for print 
until they can do everything print can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really how innovations happen&hellip;  horses can still do
lots of things that automobiles can&rsquo;t, but we know how that one
turned out.  and, like horses, print will never totally disappear&hellip;</p>

<p>you guess wrong.</p>
<p>it would be much simpler to do hyphenation in the web-browser, 
where there is usually a <em>much</em> more capable chip in play, and 
the amount of text that needs to be processed is smaller, and 
you have the luxury of the use of a scrolling field rather than 
more-difficult pagination.</p>

when the choice becomes your design versus their preferences,
their preferences win out. and it’s not even much of a contest&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t  agree with this, the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t know what they want. 
As a much more experienced and successful man said 
&quot; A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.&quot; Steve Jobs, 
so if people don&rsquo;t know what they want why don&rsquo;t we give them something as good as it can be as standard.</p>
<p>E-books are pretty much a niche product at the moment. What the current  batch of users want my not be indicative of what a wider audience may want. Most people just want an easy life, they don&rsquo;t necessarily want to fiddle around with, or can be bothered to change default, settings. As designers it is our job to design products as easy to use and as visually appealing for the majority of people as possible.</p>
<p>The setting of a book is vitally important to how the text flows and thus how easy it is to read. Maybe when E-book technology is more mature and the emphasis on E-book construction has move from being developer-lead to designer-lead things may change and we may get E-books that look as good as they are as written.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>that&rsquo;s an overstatement, but there&rsquo;s a lot of truth to it, yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if people don’t know what they want 
why don’t we give them something 
as good as it can be as standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good approach.  intelligent defaults are
probably the best thing you can do to help people out,
followed by an interface that seems &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; to them
if they <em>do</em> decide that they want to change something.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not always easy to decide what &ldquo;as good as it can be&rdquo;
actually <em>means</em> when it comes to book-design, however.</p>
<p>even some of the &ldquo;staples&rdquo; break down amazingly quickly
when you start asking people what they actually prefer&hellip;</p>
<p>what percentage of the people prefer sans-serif fonts?
what leading multiple do most people choose if they can?
what typesize will be used by people if they can control it?</p>
<p>none of these questions are ones with &ldquo;simple&rdquo; answers&hellip;</p>
<p>and whether or not typographers &ldquo;agree&rdquo; on the answers,
there exists in the population a large degree of variability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the current batch of users want my not be 
indicative of what a wider audience may want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i agree entirely.</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s important to give people the ability to
customize the tool to their own desires and preferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people just want an easy life,

</blockquote>
<p>i agree entirely.</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s not enough to give people the ability to
customize the tool to their own desires and preferences,
you&rsquo;ve gotta make sure that the defaults are well-chosen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So as designers it is our job to design products 
as easy to use and as visually appealing 
for the majority of people as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why i &ndash; as an e-book designer &ndash; am here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe when E-book technology is more mature 
and the emphasis on E-book construction has 
move from being developer-lead to designer-lead 
things may change</p>
</blockquote>
<p>um, well, yeah, i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna come to <em>that</em>&hellip;</p>
<p>not unless you designers decide to learn programming.</p>
<p>in the absence of that, you&rsquo;re going to have to settle for
being advisors to us programmers who have decided
that we want to learn some design from typographers&hellip;</p>

<p>The error in logic is thinking that it&rsquo;s either/or. Either we dictate the design as designers, or we give people full control. The nice thing about the digital world, and, specifically, HTML and CSS is that it&rsquo;s not either/or. We can (and do) have both.</p>
<p>I admit, I rarely change settings on a particular web page to accommodate my particular tastes, but I&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>I can think of more than one printed book that drove me nuts to crazy line lengths, crappy paper or weird justification, though. ;o)</p>
<p>The best definition of UX/web design I&rsquo;ve heard is that we&rsquo;re suggesters. We suggest our best solution, but don&rsquo;t prohibit the individual from not agreeing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The error in logic is thinking that it’s either/or. Either we dictate the design as designers, or we give people full control. The nice thing about the digital world, and, specifically, HTML and CSS is that it’s not either/or. We can (and do) have both&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sorry Aluminium, I don&rsquo;t see it as either or, as a designer you make the choice or you do complete designs for all possibilities, if people want to change your choices then fine, but maybe you then need to rethink why they want to change you choices:-)</p>

<p>That sentence is confusing. You say it&rsquo;s not either/or then make an this or that statement.</p>
<p>As a visual designer, you do what you can to accommodate everyone. But often your demographic can be quite broad. The nice thing about digital design is that the end user can modify your suggested design to best accommodate their particular individual needs. If one person prefers 9pt type and the other, 14pt, I suppose 12pt would be a nice compromise on paper. Even better online as they can both tweak it a tad further to their preferences.</p>

<p>When considering the numbers, keep in mind that one e-book can contain many titles. It&rsquo;s like comparing vinyl album sales to iPod sales. Which kind of points out that it wasn&rsquo;t very long ago that MP3 sales were the niche market.</p>

<p>Maybe in the developed world that will be the case. But in rural Africa, Asia, and South America, where there are no bookstores or good roads to truck books in on, eBooks are going to explode once the price drops. They’ll be huge in cities like Japan and Mumbai where families live in apartments the size of closets.

The same is true not only for e-books but also for web-browsers. (Essentially being the same.) With html/xml and css one may already define flexible layout that can adopt to the circumstances like resolution, display size, window size, desired type size, etc. The sole issue is the above-mentioned lack. Browsers/readers need to do exactly the same as the layout application of your choice does: proper text layout, hyphenation/linebreaking and justification. This would not even require alternative environments like WPF or plug-ins like Flash/AIR, at least not as long as we are talking about mere text &hellip;
And I do not agree with e-book as niche product. The web is not a niche product either, despite sub-standard represenation of text. Improve browsers/readers and all will be fine.</div>

<p>&ldquo;a million units&rdquo; is a round number, and it&rsquo;s certainly
in the ballpark.  even the people who are arguing that
the kindle has not had much effect use <em>that</em> estimate
to make their point&hellip;  it&rsquo;s just 1 out of 350 americans,
which does make the point that it&rsquo;s a <em>niche</em> product.</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to see more evidence for that estimate,
i&rsquo;ll provide it.  but i was <em>accepting</em> the stipulation.
it&rsquo;s hard to argue that e-books are <em>not</em> &ldquo;niche&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also I don’t think that e-books

<p>are you suggesting that we <em>should</em> call e-books
something else?  aside from questioning the hyphen,
i do believe that people have settled on that term&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also I don’t think that e-books 
or whatever we want to call them

as rapidly as mp3 did the CD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think anyone has seriously argued they would.
(at least, as james notes, not in the united states.)</p>
<p>the nature of a physical book is quite different from
the nature of a c.d., in that a physical book requires
no &ldquo;player&rdquo;, except a human who reads the language.
quite significantly, no electricity is required at all&hellip;</p>

<p>agreed.</p>

<p>Neither type people or e-book “designers” posturing

<p>if &ldquo;we&rdquo; offer something useful, &ldquo;we&rdquo; will indeed &ldquo;mean much&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I think that being measurably useful is

<p>if you&rsquo;re saying that running code speaks louder than words,
i agree totally.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s funny that most people never mention that at all.</p>
<p>now maybe it&rsquo;s one of those subconscious things,
and once we give it to them, they&rsquo;ll be happier and
not know why&hellip;  that kind of stuff does happen&hellip;</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the small problem that we cannot
&ndash; at present &ndash; give it to them, for the reasons
i&rsquo;ve listed above.  so it&rsquo;s kind of a moot point&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">URW&rsquo;s hz program, which included paragraph level justification and linebreaking on which Adobe&rsquo;s InDesign composers are based, was developed for use in static publishing (in which the text becomes a fixed state prior to delivery to the reader), but in many respects it is particularly appropriate to dynamic publishing (in which live text is delivered to the reader, who may e.g. change the size, change the typeface, etc.). This is what is missing from the software driving eBooks: a justification and linebreaking model that is smart enough to provide, on-the-fly, something close to the standards of a well-typeset print edition for dynamic text.</div>

<p>obviously in 10 years there&rsquo;ll be enough firepower in the iphone,
and all of the other hand-held machinery we&rsquo;re carrying around&hellip;</p>
<p>in 5 years?  probably.  but maybe not.</p>
<p>in 1 year?  perhaps.  i&rsquo;ve been led to believe that there might be
some new iphones announced in july, and that they might have
a 600mhz processor rather than the current 400mhz processor,
and that they might have 256mb of memory instead of 128mb,
all of which might well help solve the problem.</p>
<p>(did you notice a lot of occurrences of &ldquo;might&rdquo; in that sentence?)</p>
<p>so it might well be possible to do the job in real-time with them.</p>
<p>but then, of course, you have to wait for the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; hardware to
go away completely before you can <em>depend</em> on the capabilities.</p>
<p>and who knows how long that will take?</p>
<p>i mean, seriously, it&rsquo;s 2009, and a substantial amount of people
are still using internet explorer v6, with little upgrade intention.
(if they ain&rsquo;t done it by now, there&rsquo;s no reason to expect &lsquo;em to.)</p>
<p>as for the kindle, i have no idea what their capabilities might be.</p>
<p>same for android phones.  (and with them, and probably the next
iphone o.s. update as well, there&rsquo;s the issue of multi-tasking and
background processes.  on the one hand, the ability to shove this
task to the background might be a neat way to solve the problem.
on the other hand, if your app has to fight for processing cycles
with a big slew of other background processes, it might well make
the whole problem much worse.  and until you have running code,
you just plain don&rsquo;t know.)</p>
<p>so, will the problem go away?  definitely.  when?  nobody knows.</p>
<p>in the meantime, e-books are going forward without hyphenation.

<p>As designers we do seem to forget that most of the population don&rsquo;t seem to  really care, if it&rsquo;s good they don&rsquo;t notice as it works and does its job, but if it&rsquo;s bad it&rsquo;s a different matter, as one of my old tutors said to us (the class that is),
&ldquo;good design  generally goes unnoticed, it works, does its job and people don&rsquo;t mention it, but bad design people notice and tell you, again and again and again&rdquo; (bit of a para phrase there it was a while a go).</p>
<p>At the moment most people are  pobaby still just in awe of digital books, it still has the cool factor, so they ignore the limitations and bad design. But as with everything the more mainstream and common it becomes the more investment will be poured into it and the more polished and professional it will be.</p>
<p>Personally I can&rsquo;t wait until designers have the tools to set this stuff correctly as the possibilities of digital books are endless.<br>
On a separate note those choices, transfer that idea to E-books and you could have a story that never really ends.</p>

<p>I think that is such an unconstructive mindset. Programmers are programmers because that is what they are passionate about and what to be. Vice versa with typographers. For the life of me, don’t understand how people could enjoy coding things, but I am glad there are people who do. It is this passion that allows them to a better job than I ever will. It doesn’t make sense for programmers to learn <em>some design</em> from typographers and expect to produce a better solution than when they work directly in collaboration with people who have true expertise in the subject.</p>

<p>Why not? Just because web pages are dynamic, that does not mean there are not static states involved&hellip; eventually.

<p>It were be funny to have a layout application that allowed one to visually design with variables, rather than visually placing this exactly here and that exactly there.
The real issue, in my opinion, is not tools but designers. They have been trained to work within the constraints of layout applications (PageMaker, XPress, InDesign) which follow the &ldquo;this here and that there&rdquo; paradigm, and seem unable to approach design from the structure side (as the old fellows did, see Tschichold&rsquo;s or Caflisch&rsquo;s book design sketches). Design as illustration. There is almost a fear of &ldquo;mere&rdquo; structure. It would take a whole new generation not infected by the &ldquo;this here and that there&rdquo; virus. Here and now, maybe web designers are better prepared than print designers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are two additional reasons I think composing to whole pages is probably not key - One is that I don&rsquo;t want to read in &ldquo;pages&rdquo; on a device. I know that for ebooks it is less power consumptive to offer to swap whole pages rather than live scrolling but I don&rsquo;t want that. I want to scroll - and not past pages as you do in PDFs but as a whole document. I have no doubt that this is because of the web. But honestly that is how I would prefer to read. The reason that newspaper web sites break their story up is so that they can get more page views and serve more ads. If I am reading a book I don&rsquo;t want that stuff. Jumping/linking to chapters yes. Related commentary yes. But a &ldquo;page&rdquo; I can do without.</p>
<p>But even if I am forced to have pages because a paradigm I don&rsquo;t need is kept breathing by technical necessity or cultural forces - there is still no point in worry about composing to  whole pages. Saving &ldquo;pages&rdquo; is a great worry if you have paper but electronically it doesn&rsquo;t   save the publisher anything at all. The user might like to click 2 or 10 or 20 times less often to get through a book but &hellip; I just don&rsquo;t see it being important to them even if they noticed or were told it was happening.</p>
<p>It is very possible I am missing something here but that is how it looks to me just now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, the cultural forces at work here are a worry. The traditional system of referencing by title (book, article) and page number has been forcing scientific journals' publishers to match the pagination of online editions to print. You would think that scientists on the whole would be open to change or improvement, but it appears not to be the case. So XML is used for the articles to be published simultaneously in print and online with identical page breaks. The irony is that (in my very limited understanding) the XML does identify every component uniquely, and would make a much better universal reference system online.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>eben said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to scroll</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i&rsquo;ve designed my e-book viewer-app to allow scrolling,
if a user chooses.  but it&rsquo;s a very tiny minority that does.
(and, personally, i&rsquo;ve never understood that choice, since
scrolling takes so much work, yet isn&rsquo;t quite as accurate.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>even if I am forced to have pages because 
a paradigm I don’t need is kept breathing
by technical necessity or cultural forces</p>
</blockquote>
<p>people <em>prefer</em> pagination, because it enhances readability,
since it&rsquo;s faster, more accurate, and less work than scrolling.</p>
<p>as far as &ldquo;technical necessity&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s <em>far</em> easy to use scrolling.
you just toss the text into a scrolling field and you are done,
with the o.s. handling all the scrolling operations from there.
pagination, on the other hand, requires all kinds of hard work.</p>
<p>and the &ldquo;cultural forces&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t anything to sneeze at either&hellip;
if we could magically transition from paper-books to e-books
just by snapping our fingers, we might be able to leave behind
all references to page-numbers.  but that ain&rsquo;t gonna happen.
so, for the next few decades or so, we&rsquo;re going to have to grok
page-numbers to take advantage of our cultural legacy which
made heavy use of that methodology as its &ldquo;link&rdquo; mechanism&hellip;</p>
<p>(besides, we&rsquo;d just have to settle on some new methodology.
the operation known as &ldquo;linking&rdquo; on the web is badly lacking,
because you cannot link to a specific place on a specific page
unless the author of that page created a named anchor there.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user might like to click 2 or 10 or 20 times less often to 
get through a book but &hellip; I just don’t see it being important 
to them even if they noticed or were told it was happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in general, i agree.  and i was shocked to see that many people
who are reformatting e-books for their kindles and iliads were
using no margins on them, since that is very distracting to me.
when i asked them why they&rsquo;d made this curious choice, they
responded that it was to cut down on the number of pages,
because they didn&rsquo;t like having to turn pages.  they said it is
too time-consuming (because pageturns are slow) and also
too distracting (because these machines do a &ldquo;reverse flash&rdquo;
on a pageturn) and because it used up the battery too quickly
(because pageturns are the only time the machine uses juice).
so pageturns took them out of their immersion in the story&hellip;</p>
<p>now, all three of those problems might eventually be overcome,
but at present, actual users prefer a minimal number of pages&hellip;
to the point they will give up all margins to attain that imperative.</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s a new iphone e-book viewer-app,
out just today after being held in purgatory
because an inept apple review had held it up
&ndash; since it could access the kama sutra from
project gutenberg, which is a naughty book &ndash;
that does hyphenation!  you must be <em>thrilled</em>!      :+)</p>
<p>how does it manage this feat?</p>
<p>well, it only offers one font.  and it won&rsquo;t let you
rotate the display, so it only offers one viewport.
and it constrains the typesize to just five choices.
and it won&rsquo;t let you set the margins, or the leading.</p>
<p>and if you open a book immediately upon download,
you must wait for a minute or two while it paginates.
(although it seems to save the data, so it&rsquo;s one-time.)</p>
<p>if you can accept all those constraints, voila, hyphenation!</p>
<p>the name of the app is &ldquo;eucalyptus&rdquo;.  it&rsquo;ll set you back $10.</p>

Of course, I&rsquo;m easily irritated; I&rsquo;m still angry that solid setting caused ascenders and descenders to overlap when Futura was made available for film-setting, and still angry that the mistake wasn&rsquo;t corrected when the font was digitized.</p>
<p>Bowerbird says, &ldquo;one of the primary tenants of e-book philosophy is that the end-user should have control over the fonts used&hellip;&rdquo;. Marketing points now qualify as philosophy? And the word is tenets, not tenants; even so, I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to live there.</p>
<p>What an absurd notion. Does the average user have any knowledge of what makes a text readable or a font legible? The average computer user still double-spaces after punctuation, a practice that should have died with the demise of the typewriter, or at least be restricted to monospaced fonts. We should simply disregard 570 years of knowledge; knowledge which enabled the spread of civilization, because e-books have arrived!</p>
<p>To a typographer, the only book suitable for display on the Kindle is &ldquo;A River Runs Through It&rdquo;, an apt description of e-book typography in general. The arrival of e-books have not rendered the contributions of Gill, Morrison, Ward, Dowding, Zapf, Frutiger, et al obsolete; the insights gained by their labors are now needed more than ever.</p>

This is what is missing from the software driving eBooks: a justification and linebreaking model that is smart enough to provide, on-the-fly, something close to the standards of a well-typeset print edition for dynamic text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But neither XPress8 nor InDesignCS4 can automatically produce well-set pages that even approach the standards set by such giants as Jan Tschichold, Hermann Zapf, or Geoffrey Dowding; acceptably competent is the highest level these applications can achieve—without designer intervention. Most printed books fall short of the ideal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellence in typography is the result of nothing more than an attitude. Its appeal comes from the understanding used in its planning; the designer must care.&rdquo; If one can program that onto a chip, the problem will be solved.</p>

<p>the arrogance of the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; always amuses me.</p>
<p>for any particular book, i don&rsquo;t care, choose whatever you want,
and for the body of the book, just answer me these questions&hellip;</p>
<p>what point-size is &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;, such that, if i were to adjust it,
i would be causing myself &ldquo;a substandard reading experience&rdquo;?</p>
<p>what leading is &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;?  what margins are &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;?  and
would changing those make &ldquo;a substandard reading experience&rdquo;?</p>
<p>what font is best?  (and if you gave the job to 20 great designers,
how many of them do you think would choose that same font?)</p>
<p>do you really, honestly and truly, think that you can decide this,

In CSS, user choices trump everything. There’s no way around it.</p>
<p>This says nothing at all about the usefulness and purpose of well-chosen <em>default</em> settings. It is merely a reminder that, by virtue of the technology, people can select other settings if they wish. I am of course in favour of limiting the available options to things we know aren’t harmful, but the cat’s kind of out of the bag in that respect, is it not?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Choosing the type size on e-books is fine. Books come out in large-type editions all the time. Nobody&rsquo;s arguing against that.</p>
<p>But what precludes e-book readers from doing fair (ie, state of the art) H&amp;J and suggesting a pleasant, well-made typeface that complements each book? There&rsquo;s especially no excuse for bad H&amp;J. Computer scientists have been working on that for three decades now.</p>
<p>Having adequate typography on e-book readers is no reason the users couldn&rsquo;t choose the typeface, type size, and margins. This is a false dichotomy.</p>
<p>I admit leading isn&rsquo;t so much a matter of choice. Very few choices of leading will be pleasant to look at for a given combination of output device and font. Users will only really care about the leading if the default is ill-chosen, but the default should really depend on the font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">bowerbird, I just checked your eucalyptus link, and here&rsquo;s a thought. The text as shown is set at an approximate line length of 30 to 35 characters; however, optimal line length for readability is between 45 to 70 characters. Why not make the default setting a rotated page (the iPhone held in landscape orientation) that allows for that line length? This would also allow for an immediate improvement in H&amp;J, as fewer hyphens are required when setting longer lines.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed, but the point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that the horizontal format allows for more flexibility for the reader (end-user), while allowing better default formatting choices to the programmer. The vertical format, because of the small screen, has rivers running through the type, which draws the eye downward and distracts the reader. The horizontal format overcomes this limitation to some extent. Of course, if the reader wants only 5 lines of text per page, the rivers will return, and that&rsquo;s his choice.</div>

Good luck with that, the resolution of the iphone is too coarse for type that small to be a comfortable read.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve read a couple dozen books on my iphone using Stanza. It&rsquo;s not amazing but not aweful either. The most challenging part for me is the active display, which I&rsquo;ve compensated for by making the type white on black. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>But the point is that the simple act of turning the phone 90° gives <em>line-length	</em> more real estate, making for immediate improvement, not to get more type per page, but <em>per line</em>, a low-tech solution that improves readability, while making no further demands on current processors.</p>
<p>It is easier to read the random line:</p>
<p>“straight down High Street without any apparent consciousness that”</p>
<p>than it is to read:</p>
<p>“The  general  route  of  the  Great  In-”;
the reader (end-user) is better able to establish a reading rhythm.</p>
<p>This should satisfy both typographer and programmer. I could have been more attentive to refinements in the actual setting, but that wouldn&rsquo;t show the <em>inherent</em> difference. I should have been more diligent, though, and made the type the same point size; here’s the revised file showing both, the text is now the same size, though I’ve still neglected to add the reflection and glare:

<p>This is not us arrogant experts vs you pompous programmer even if you want to see it like that. By the way I would not call me an expert, especially around the people that write in typophile.</p>
<p>This issue is not that recent, of course my old aunt needs a different setup for text than me, this is also done in books. It has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>But a book is not just text, and the current readers provide a substandar reading experience to the users, because they are very limited. No problem, they will change and evolve and will some day get it.</p>
<p>So use the opportunity wisely, learn what is behind our reasons and this technological wonder that is the written language.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take it personal it&rsquo;s not your fault the kindle was designed so poorly.</p>

<p>i see.  you consider your pager and your newton
to have been evolutionary steps toward the new
and improved devices, rather than dead ends&hellip;</p>
<p>and when you said &ldquo;substandard reading experience&rdquo;,
you really meant &ldquo;which will be improved upon soon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>and rather than relegating to &ldquo;the back of the drawer&rdquo;,
the current hardware, you&rsquo;ll keep it and keep using it
until something better becomes available for your use.</p>
<p>i hope you&rsquo;ll see how this might have been unclear earlier.</p>
<p>and i think it should be obvious i agree with this rendering.
yet for some reason, i picked up that you had put yourself
into opposition with my position.  my mistake?  or yours?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Bowerbird:</p>
<p>Assuming that you are not simply being argumentative for your own amusement, your questions deserve honest answers; I’ll attempt to provide them.</p>
<p>Q: <em>“what point-size is “optimal”, such that, if i were to adjust it, i would be causing myself “a substandard reading experience”?”</em></p>
<p>A: Obviously, it depends upon the size, resolution and contrast ratio of the device or page in question. The optimal point size is determined by the number of characters per line, including word spaces; a substantial amount of objective research, using double-blind methodology, has determined this to be between 45 and 70 characters per line; at these line lengths, both reading speed and comprehension improve for most readers. Moreover, these line lengths will prevent “rivers” from drawing the eye downwards rather than across the page. Rivers are excessive negative space between words; well-set type will appear as a series of clearly-defined strips when one squints at the text. The vertically-oriented iPhone illustration shows excessive rivers in the text.</p>
<p>Q: <em>“what leading is “optimal”? what margins are “optimal”? and would changing those make “a substandard reading experience”?”</em></p>
<p>A: Leading will be sufficient, (and I will define “optimal leading” as sufficient leading) when the phenomenon of “bounce-back” does not occur. Bounce-back can be defined as the eye of the reader tending to return to the beginning of the line he has just read once he has reached the end, rather than naturally moving to the next line. Again, this is measurable, and has been demonstrated with double-blind studies; eye-movements of the participants were photographically measured. The horizontally-oriented phone shown in the last image I posted has leading that is slightly too tight; some readers may experience bounce back when reading that passage. Leading added after bounce-back has been eliminated would indeed be a wholly subjective decision.</p>
<p>Optimal margins are much more subjective; Jan Tschichold and others have written extensively on the subject; but it would be sufficient to say that the margins are <em>acceptable</em> when the reader is not distracted from reading by awareness of the physical medium. The intended design of this comments section has both optimal line length and leading, that is when it is not defeated by users physically entering returns, as you appear to have done.</p>
<p>Q: <em>“what font is best? (and if you gave the job to 20 great designers,
how many of them do you think would choose that same font?)”</em></p>
<p>A: There is no “best” font; however, legibility (defined by the OED as: “clear enough to read”; i.e., the letterforms cannot easily be confused with one another) is the prime consideration to be taken into account when choosing a font; that&rsquo;s why almost no one except semi-literate gang members set text in Old English capitals or Script capitals (although I’ve met people who think both are “pretty”, or “classy”—<em>shudder</em>). Avant Garde Gothic has a slight legibility problem with the lowercase “a”, it can be easily mistaken for a lowercase “o”; Calypso is almost completely illegible. After taking legibility into account, the next choice would be voice, the <em>feeling</em> one wishes to convey; this is subjective, and other choices made after these two have been taken into consideration are progressively more subjective.</p>
<p>How do you define “great designer”? Phil Dusenberry would say a great designer “cuts through the clutter”; David Carson immediately comes to mind. I would define the term more conservatively; a great designer is one who can impart information while requiring the least amount of effort from the consumer of that information; Paul Rand would meet both Dusenberry’s and my definitions. If you asked twenty “great designers” to come up with a list of ten typefaces for consideration for a new edition of <em>The Odyssey</em>, though, many font names would likely be repeated.</p>

<p>bowerbird, I love my Newton, specially the old eMate, it still looks fantastic.</p>
<p>I do think they were the first steps for new devices, but after more than 10 years this devices are not as evolved as they could. Technically they are poles apart, but reading an ebook on my N2010 is not very different.</p>
<p>I think current readers are substandard because they don&rsquo;t add nothing new, they just are the cheapest way to output a text. And what really vex me is that this was the objective.</p>
<p>Imagine the Kindle with a proper set of type. Give the designer/programmer tools to preserve technical standards and the spirit of the text. Then let the reader adjust what they want to read better.</p>
<p>I am not very sure specific function devices have any future, right now they can be improved.</p>
<p>Perdón si no fui claro antes.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> give citations, if I wanted to spend a day at the library, but I really don’t have the time; you could do the research, too; the information is out there. Of course there’s variability; I never argued against that. That’s why I cite a range for line lengths; some faces will make for easily-readable text at 37 characters per line, etc.</p>
<p>These are just good starting points to build on, not hard &amp; fast rules by much we must all be bound. And of course the reader should have some control over the appearance; I have no problem with the reader having the ability to change size, etc. I was just trying to suggest that we can all work together to achieve the best possible results; that the designers of ebooks can benefit from some of the hard-won knowledge gained during the past 570 years of printing history, and to give some indication that typographers are more than mere æstheticians.</p>

&ldquo;i’m sorry if it hurts your feelings. but users want the control.
when the choice becomes your design versus their preferences,
their preferences win out. and it’s not even much of a contest&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How do you know this to be true? Please tell us.
Are you privvy to the insane amount of &ldquo;telemetry&rdquo; gathered about user habits by Microsoft and Google?
Have you ever supported real live actual users, visited their workstations, and therefore been in a position to observe first-hand and note patterns in their behavior?
I have. Thousands of them. And in places where you would expect users to be fairly venturesome and leading edge. Viacom, Multi-National Banks. (You haven&rsquo;t lived until you&rsquo;ve done desktop suppport on a trading floor where, if a trader&rsquo;s workstation goes down, the bank can lose, literally lose millions of dollars in the space of minutes. There&rsquo;s a lot of turnover.)</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing in my experience jibes with what you claim. People will accept and stick with the default settings they&rsquo;re given every time. Except for a small coterie of &ldquo;tinkerers&rdquo; and power users. And the power user&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t usually mess with the UI defaults either. They&rsquo;re more sophisticated in other ways.</p>
<p>I think you are trying to pass off wishful thinking, or a philosophy of a sort, as empirical fact.</p>
<p>Once again, how do you know your statement is true?</p>

“People will accept and stick with the default settings they’re given every time”</p>
<p>A bit of hyperbole. I forget, sometimes, on forums that we don&rsquo;t have facial expression and tone of voice working for us. ;)
However, I think the impulse to just take a thing and use it as it&rsquo;s been given to us is rooted in human nature.
Anyway, if someone is given the opportunity to sample two different software products, and one has smart, user-friendly defaults and the other doesn&rsquo;t, all other things being equal, which one are they going to choose?</p>

&ldquo;the “traditional” solution is to split the line, and indent the second
(and any subsequent) line so that it’s noticeable as a continuation&hellip;&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s why I pose the question: even when you do that, you must consider properly where to split the line. When you change typography (shape or size) can the program keep some information (programming) on more that one way to split the line properly (when there&rsquo;s more than one way)?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, @bowerbird and @faraqat, that’s why I thought that the horizontal-orientation solution I proposed was a good one (at least for the iPhone). That, in combination with using PDFs as the ebook file, could make for well-designed ebooks, if Adobe could provide for automatic line re-breaking when a reader enlarges the display (or is that a new PostScript feature I’ve missed?). That seems to me to be better, and less memory intensive than a provision for changing typeface and type size. Please explain any inherent problems with this suggestion.</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>This would massively improve what bibliophiles call book discovery. You&rsquo;re far more likely to hear about a book if a friend has highlighted a couple brilliant sentences in a Facebook update—and if you hear about it, you&rsquo;re far more likely to buy it in print. Yes, in print: The few authors who have experimented with giving away digital copies (mostly in sci-fi) have found that they end up selling more print copies, because their books are discovered by more people.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>most e-book reader-programs for the iphone <em>do</em>
let the user rotate the unit to a landscape display&hellip;</p>
<p>why eucalyptus doesn&rsquo;t, i don&rsquo;t really know for sure.</p>
<p>but i suspect it&rsquo;s precisely because it would make
the task of doing the pagination even more sticky,
because the program would have to do 10 of &lsquo;em
