  something different like r.alt02 then instead of getting: /r.alt/r.alt/r.alt02 I
  get: /r.alt02/r.alt02/r.alt02 so it changes all alts before it. Another way might
  be /p.end/p.end and the selecting q.swsh instead of /p.end/p.end/q.swsh I get /p.swsh/p.swsh/q.swsh
  \r\n\r\nI'm guessing that I set up the aalt feature wrong?\r\n\r\nsub r from [r

    in 'aalt' does not mean that alternate glyphs are not available in the glyph palette.
    It only means that alternate glyphs are not listed as alternates in a glyph's
    popup showing alternates."

  body: "Do you mean the glyph palette in Illustrator?\r\nWhen I do my features as
    above with the aalt feature listed 1st in the feature code I can access any character
    from the glyph palette and most can be adjusted easily from the opentype one.
    The aalt feature should give you little arrows in the glyph palette by each glyph
    that has alternates and clicking the arrow produces a submenu of those alternates.
    The aalt feature shouldn't be in the opentype menu at all. There is a salt feature
    for Illustrator there, but that's different.\r\nWhat features do you have in this
    font?"

  body: "k.l, I don't have InDesign so I can't say.\r\n\r\nStephen, Yes, the glyph
    palette in Illustrator. Exactly, it's not in the menu it works just like your
    explaining.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens when two or more alts are selected together
    for instance: I spell Betty and highlight the two t's and select from the pop
    out glyph menu the extra swashy t_t. That works so I decide to change the y to
    the extra swashy ending y from the pop out menu and when I do that the y is fine
    but the extra swashy t_t behind it turns into t.alt So it's now Bety. Since I
    have removed all other features but the aalt from the font, the only explanation
    can be that the aalt feature is doing this.\r\n\r\nI've created many opentype
    fonts with the aalt feature but usually with just one or two alternates to choose
    from. This font I'm working on, one glyph can have up to 5 alternates.\r\n\r\nfeature
    aalt {\r\n sub A from [A.alt A.alt02];\r\n sub B from [B.alt];\r\n sub K from
    [K.swsh];\r\n sub L from [L.swsh];\r\n sub M from [M.alt M.alt02];\r\n sub N from
    [N.alt N.alt02];\r\n sub Q from [Q.swsh];\r\n sub R from [R.swsh];\r\n sub a from
    [a.startswsh a.endswsh];\r\n sub b from [b.startswsh b.endswsh];\r\n sub c from
    [c.startswsh c.endswsh];\r\n sub d from [d.startswsh d.endswsh];\r\n sub e from
    [e.startswsh e.endswsh];\r\n sub f from [f.startswsh f.endswsh];\r\n sub g from
    [g.alt g.startswsh g.endswsh];\r\n sub h from [h.startswsh h.endswsh];\r\n sub
    i from [i.startswsh i.endswsh];\r\n sub j from [j.startswsh j.endswsh];\r\n sub
    k from [k.alt k.startswsh k.endswsh];\r\n sub l from [l.start l.alt_end l.startswsh
    l.endswsh];\r\n sub m from [m.startswsh m.endswsh];\r\n sub n from [n.startswsh
    n.endswsh];\r\n sub o from [o.alt o.startswsh o.endswsh];\r\n sub p from [p.startswsh
    p.endswsh];\r\n sub q from [q.startswsh q.endswsh];\r\n sub r from [r.alt r.alt02
    r.start r.startswsh r.endswsh];\r\n sub s from [s.startswsh s.endswsh];\r\n sub
    t from [t.alt t_t.alt t_t t.startswsh t.endswsh];\r\n sub u from [u.startswsh
    u.endswsh];\r\n sub v from [v.alt v.alt_startswsh v.startswsh v.endswsh];\r\n
    sub w from [w.alt w.alt_startswsh w.startswsh w.endswsh];\r\n sub x from [x.startswsh
    x.endswsh];\r\n sub y from [y.alt y.alt02 y.startswsh y.endswsh];\r\n sub z from
    [z.alt z.startswsh z.endswsh]; \r\n} aalt;\r\n\r\nThe reason I didn't set up the
    swsh feature for the lowercase letters is because it's just too much, it's better
    if it's used sparingly and selectively."

    this, the behavior is not a surprise: You consider t_t and t_t.alt as alternates
    for t -- which they obviously are not. Better do this:\r\n\r\n<cite>sub t from
    [t.alt t.startswsh t.endswsh];</cite>\r\n<cite>sub t_t from [t_t.alt];</cite>\r\n"

  body: Thanks k.l. That will help with those alternates and I just tried it with
    the sub r from [r.alt r.alt02] in the same location and it caused the same collapse.
    So I did sub r.alt from [r.alt02]; and that fixes the problem for that, although
    the fact that it is a problem is puzzling. Having the swsh feature listed makes
    more sense. Maybe if I move the start and end swashes to a stylistic set it will
    fix that problem too. - Jess
