body: "In the calt feature of my font, I am trying to get |t i| to substitute for
  |t dotlessi| so that the crossbar of the t acts as the tittle of the i.\r\nThis
  is easy enough and works fine:\r\n\r\n   sub @tbeforei i' by dotlessi;\r\n(it is
  a class because it contains ligatures ending in t and alternate forms of t)\r\n\r\nMy
  problem arises with the next lookup in calt, which is supposed to substitute glyphs
  at the ends of words with their ending alternates:\r\n\r\n  ignore sub @tobeendform'
  @letter;\r\n  sub @tobeendform' by @endform;\r\n\r\nso it should change the glyph
  in the tobeendform class to its corresponding glyph in the endform class.  This
  works on all letters except i when following t.  I have both i and dotlessi in the
  tobeendform class and i.end and dotlessi.end in the endform class.\r\n\r\nI know
  it's unlikely that words ending in ti will crop up that often, but I'm asking because
  this problem has wider implications.  I've tried swapping the two lookups round
  and even duplicating the lookups so that if one happens first, the other will happen
  after nomatter what, but that doesn't work.  I don't understand why the first lookup
  has changed the i to dotlessi, but then the second lookup can't change this dotlessi
  to dotlessi.end\r\n\r\nIf anyone can shed any light on this I'd be very grateful!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've found the problem - I hadn't separated the lookups properly like this:\r\n<cite>\r\n
    \ lookup endforms {\r\n  ignore sub @tobeendform' @letter;\r\n  sub @tobeendform'
    by @endform; \r\n  }endforms;\r\n</cite>\r\nso the ignore sub parts were covering
    everything in the calt feature, not just the following lines of code.\r\n\r\nDuh!"
