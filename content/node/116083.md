  body: "I doubt this was a font in 1939. Looks like the creation of a rather uninspired
    lettering artist -- perhaps a lab technician who could be spared from thawing
    ice samples -- who may have worked with a crude stencil and filled in the gaps.
    You can get pretty close if you use Flatsider JNL  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/flatsider/
    clip off the extra bits on C, G and J and reverse the Z to make S.\r\nDon"

  body: "Don\r\n\r\nI agree, it does look hand-lettered.\r\n\r\nNot the work of a
    lab technician though - the Snow Cruiser was built in the US by the Pullman Company
    and left the factory fully painted.\r\n\r\nFlatsider JNL looks like a great starting
    point.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\nGraham"
