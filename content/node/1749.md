  body: I like it Wanda, but don&#39;t forget other printing techniques, like stamping
    or embossing. Maybe if your wr was smaller it could be so cool blind embossed
    or heat stamped into a textured paper so the logo was shiny and smooth to  contrast
    with the textured paper. I see alot of cards using black and a PMS ink and after
    awhile you kind of yawn. I once had a folding card with a diecut on the cover
    and when you opened it, it listed our agencies services  and on the inside i had
    a list of companies we did work for. Very elegant. Just some ideas, Dan

  body: Wanda one more idea think about printing your card on a vellum stock with
    metallic inks, modern rich look.
