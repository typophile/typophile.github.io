  body: Ok, one comment in the article is from an NKU student, as well as an NKU prof,
    where I happen to go. I think it's safe to say that a certain person isn't very
    well typographically informed, as well as neglecting to acknowledge the fundamental
    differences between a centuries old craft and Star Wars. Although the Star Wars
    argument has some merit in my book, and I don't even own any of them.

    statement.)\r\nThat's wrong. The renaissance happened before the Web."

  body: "it just says \"faciliated\", not \"was the reason for\" or whatever. i'd
    say that the internet is one part of the ongoing digital revolution, so it surely
    faciliated any changes in the type industry (just look at distribution and think
    about your sentence again). well, this is, if you take \"type distribution\" as
    a part of type design -> type industry for me.\r\n\r\n(the article is very interesting,
    i'll try to answer later on)"
