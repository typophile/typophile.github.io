  Calliope</a> in use if anyone has seen it. The typeface, drawn by Gayle Sato and
  digitized by Mark van Bronkhorst, is one of the few natural and readable handwriting
  font families. I hope I'm not the only one who appreciates it and it's been put
  into action somewhere.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cal_samp_3445.gif]"

  body: Hmm, I guess someone could just invent a "real-world use". Where's fontplay
    when you need him?

  body: Well, if I wanted a face like this, I'd probably use Tekton instead, but that's
    because I'm a Frank Ching fan....

  body: Tekton is too rigid and te(k)chnical to be in this category I think. Tell
    me about Frank. I don't know him.

  body: I like <a href="http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/5">Brisa</a> too, but it's not
    quite as open and legible as Calliope. <a href="http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/51">Tiza</a>
    is my favorite Sudtipos typeface in this genre.

  body: "<em>Tell me about Frank. I don\u2019t know him.</em>\r\n\r\nI know his work
    well, but that probably because my primary lettering background is in architectural/interior
    design: he's exceptionally well known for authoring <em>Building Construction
    Illustrated</em> and <em>Architectural Graphics</em>: classics in the field.\r\n\r\nIt
    was also used as the model for the digital versions produced by Adobe -- I'm sure
    Thomas will correct me if I'm wrong in the chronology, but Tekton MM was an early
    implementation of the MM format. \r\n\r\nAnyone who did a/i design in the 1970's
    was encouraged (if not browbeaten!) into a not-dissimilar lettering style...."

  body: Sadly no one came forth with a Calliope usage sample, so we went ahead and
    made our own for the FontShop newsletter on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/virtual/newsletters/feb2007_b/">handwriting
