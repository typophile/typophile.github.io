		<div class="commentbody">I'm really fond of using a sans-serif font for headlines then a serif font for the body text, or the other way around. I think you need to find a strong serif typeface with a large family for body text. Although, then again, it definitely depends on what you're using this for. If it's for the internet, you could just use Bree itself, I think that would look classy. But if it's for a print media, I really think you should find a strong serif typeface. I dunno, maybe it's just me.</div>

most common letter that would go a long way towards creating harmony with Bree.
A secondary letter to consider is the "f", which of course points towards Fedra.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi

thanks for the suggestions. Although I am still confused if Bree as body would work well for a 200 page document?

Fedra seems interesting, will try that. Can I get an alternative for Karmina? and also what about Excelsior? I liked the contrast but is it too wide to set well with bree??

I looked at apex and Dax too. I liked Dax as its tall and condensed feel which goes well with bree. But not satisfied yet.
Looking forward for more suggestions

		<div class="commentbody">Something that should have been asked at the very beginning:
What is it about?

Nothing like Bree for a long document, please! In fact the only sans I
would personally recommend for long text is Legato (which however
probably does not harmonize with Bree).

Karmina: Note the very large x-height - suitable for ~9 point. Is that
a size that works here? Unless you're trying to economize space, for a
long document it seems too harsh in terms of readability.

Excelsior: Are you looking for an old newspaper look? Otherwise I'd
stay away from that class of type. Also, there's the same issue with the
large x-height.

BTW, I'm not sure you need something narrow - and certainly that
can't be the only thing holding the two fonts together. But you might
still look at the work of Sumner Stone, who seems to have a penchant
for narrow type.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Hrant,

Well i wanted to use bree just for the headings, and for body something that just blends in and of course is legible. I feel that for a document ( Which has something to do with DESIGN RESEARCH), bree definitely is a no go for text. Thats why the question. But as the text is large, I would choose serif. 

Combining Excelsior was just an exercise to find interesting contrasts. I agree its very old newspaper like and I was just looking for options and opinions.

By the discussions so far I feel a serif would be the way... karmina seems suitable, but somewhere I feel the need to explore more before I carry on.

Cheers

		<div class="commentbody">Design research? Then I might look for something less organic than Karmina. Something a bit sharp and formal, but with Bree's roundness and slight unorthodoxy... Maybe a wedge-serif... Hmmm, this really wasn't my intention, but... Patria?  :-)  See the right-hand column here: http://granshan.org/works/2008/hrant.pdf
