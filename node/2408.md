  alt=""> <BR> <BR>I did a logo for a client which I think turned out very good, but
  now the company name was refused so they had to stick with CAPA and drops the &amp;
  ASSOCIADOS for legal issues. This laywer company is named CAPA that stands for the
  K word in Portuguese. Now I have some problems on the original concept. Tell me
  where makes more sense to you the type position. Should I only stick with the SERIF
  and drops Avenir for the description? Please be free to try other positions <IMG

  body: I think the mark is just too big for the type  <BR>options you are showing.
    Try reducing the mark to  <BR>50-65% of what it is and then pair it up with the  <BR>type.

  body: I think 1 and 4 is the best, leaning against 4... Try make the right side
    of the type aligned with eachother making an impression of the verical bar of
    the &#34;k&#34;. <BR> <BR>/f

  body: the &#34;k&#34; seems to float around, it has no real anchor. <BR>What about
    aligning the &#34;k&#34; to the type like this? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22460.jpg"

  body: I like that a lot &#40;anchoring the K like that&#41; it really makes it work
    now with the type.

  body: 'Adriano, I would work on the the last suggestion from the first group you
    have uploaded &#40;the one with thin vertical line dividing CAPA from sociedade...&#41;.
    My suggestion is to align the K sign&#39;s lower serif with the beginig of &#34;sociedade&#34;.
    This centered composition might be too rigid. <BR> <BR>The logo is beautiful!

  body: ok, I need to take good photos from this, only one survived the out of focus
    mayhem, the top A4 letterhead. I&#39;ll soon place photos of the rest of the stuff.
    <BR> <BR>The lawyers decied to stick with this version, and wanted this ENOURMOUS
    ammount of names on the letterhead. I think the bar could be thicker on the logo.  <BR>
