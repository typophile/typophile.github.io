What do you think of the letters? What can i do better? i draw letters very seldom, so any feedback is welcome. I have a feeling the 's' and   the'e' could  be better. I looked at a couple of fonts that at first glance looked suitable, but wouldn't do the trick. So I started drawing myself, keeping an eye at the features i liked in the initial fonts. 

The logo is for a industrial design company. Serious but friendly etc. THe name is Kode Design.

Thanks!

Obviously, your d's aren't the same, is that on purpose? Also, your ascenders/descenders seem rather staunch. 

What kind of products do Kode Design design? I'm curious also about the decision behind choosing Blue and Black for the color scheme. if you're flexible with color choices, I'd consider something more subtle. It's clever that you picked out KO and DE, but the color choices feel as if you're pushing this idea down my throat instead of me slowly realizing it. Make it more subliminal.

		<div class="commentbody">I think it´s very nice. And for the "serious but friendly" part, it´s right on the spot. I think you should keep the colors.
Here´s some suggestments:
The ascender on the bottom d may be too short, make a printout in small sizes to check!
The ending on g should be more like that of e, at least in thickness.
The ending on e looks a bit flat in the middle, try shortening it for a more fluent ending.
The s needs some more weight in the middle. This will also make the endings less flat, which is a good thing.
The flared stroke on d and k may be applied on i, for consinstency
Maybe you could do a whole typeface out of this?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you've achieved the friendly/technical aspect right on! Here are my comments on shapes and etc.:

The "e" looks more condensed than the other letters, also, the way the counter and the beginning of the terminal (left part right below the counter doesn't look like it's flowing too well).

Your "g" has a curved feel as opposed to a more vertical "d" - I'd go one way or another - not both.

The top anchor point on the lower case "n" is going from straight to round. Maybe smoothing that out would help consistency.

I'd test the ascenders without angles. Agree with toby about the "i" in case you want to keep the angle.

The "s" looks lighter than the rest. Drawing S's is a pain in the s if you allow me a poetic license.

It's going to look nice when you're done!

One more vote for making it a typeface.

have made the 'e' less condensed, worked on the g (both angle and descender) and made the 's' a little fatter. I stay with the the angled ascenders.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3more_3776.jpg]

number one is the same as before, but with the mentioned changes. 
number two is with an italic 'e'.
number three is with semi-stencil look.

what do you think?

oh, and i stay with these colors for now:-)

		<div class="commentbody">I like number 1 the best out of the latest batch. I still say that the 'g' needs some optical correction. The bowl should thin where it meets the descender, just like the 'e' in number 2.

The 's' is better weight-wise, but the curves at the bottom are looking a little lumpy.

The logo is progressing nicely though.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,
my customer settled on this one. A bit thinner, and the 'e' and'g' are modified. oh, and the color has changed :-)

Do you see any obvious flaws? I know tthe 'g' is a bit too wide, and i don't know what to think about the 's'.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/picture_6020.jpg]


Adjusted stem widths, over/undershoots and cleaned up paths.

also, please take a look at the pdf for closer examination (if you want to).


thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Hm, unfortunately I have to say I don't think it has improved over the last one. 
I find the decrease in weight making the characters a bit, I don't know, wobbly. 
Also the difference in weight between the different characters has increased.
I also think the round 'g' was much better, it was a better match with the other characters. The slanted crossbar of the 'e' is somewhat distracting, in my opinion, since it is a slant none of the other characters have. And about the colors, the blue looks a bit RGB-ish to me. The cyan was looking much more natural, although it needed some attention too.

I'm sorry if I'm sounding a bit harsh, just giving my opinions. I think the first 
(or second, slightly adjusted) version is still the best. :)</div>

Thats perfectly ok:-) The client didn't like the first weight, and the y really like the new one. So the weight stays. Colors aren't finished, but it's going to be something like this. 

as for the rounded 'g', they didn't like it. i also grew tired of it. i think it's too childish.

what can be done to distribute weight better betweeen letters?

		<div class="commentbody">Well, if you compare the 'd' with the 's', for example, there is quite a bit of difference in weight. As in the 'd' is much heavier (the 's' needs more weight). And the therminals ('s', 'e', 'g') get awfully thin, when compared to the 'normal' stroke width.
The old 'g' too childish? Maybe, but it was consistent as well.

But your outlines seem quite smooth. Only the top of the 'g' can use some attention (where the bowl connects to the top-right corner). I might make the curve the same as the 'n' (only mirrored of course).

As for the color, it has this PMS Reflex/Process Blue vibe going on now, if you know what I mean. With a touch of RGB-ness. I don't know, maybe you can go through a PMS swatchguide to pick one in the vicinity of the color you have now, that looks a bit more natural. :)

[edit] fixed typo.
