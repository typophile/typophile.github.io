  body: "I agree... Larabie was the first thought I had too.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Well,
    once again I am amazed... I had all but given up on MyFonts.com's \"WhatTheFont\"
    utility, as it almost never seems to get me close to what I'm looking for, even
    with a good start image... but I tried uploading this cr*ppy little \"DUKE2009\"
    image and it gave me -- as first choice, mind you -- Megahertz In-Italic from
    T-26! \r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/megahertz/in-italic/\r\n\r\nLooks
    spot-on to me, so I'm buying the family (we're starting a project, can't tell
    you what it is ;-)\r\n\r\nI'm betting I've seen this (or something very close)
    as a knockoff on the web -- it's far too \"tech\" for the pirates to have left
    alone."
