body: "There is lots of conversation going on about the AIGA \"Justified\" competition,
  which has replaced its other annual design competitions with one in which an explanation
  must accompany the submission addressing the brief, strategy, and assessment of
  effectiveness. The stir about this change was accelerated by [[http://imprint.printmag.com/design-thinking/aiga-unjustified/|Paula
  Scher's Imprint column]] decrying the change. The commentary on that post has been
  rich and spirited both pro- and con-.\r\n\r\nHow about  type design competitions?
  Would/could/should a type competition also evaluate the purpose that a design serves
  rather than just the design's qualities (beyond the existing bounds of, for example,
  display vs. text)? "

  body: I agree with Hrant. Some type design and engineering projects require a certain
    level of explanation, but others do not. The problem would probably be solved
    by having a third category, "text", "display" and "other".

    an entry passes muster, and it's too much to expect most judges to immediately
    notice its subtle genius. But if they (have to) read some sort of minimal explanation
    they have a chance to pay attention to what the point is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    AD/graphic design competitions being that work is done to a brief, within the

    for most foundry-initiated types that is not the case (my designs, for instance,

    (Latin American type design biennial) you must include a brief text of around
    600 characters set in 10 pt. Verdana at the bottom of the page. I think it is
    a good decision since I can explain some things there. As an example, I could
    explain why Gandhi Serif is lighter than usual or why Gandhi Sans has some \u201Cserifness\u201D
    on it; that sort of things that you can\u2019t tell by watching the design and
    that possibly might be disregarded or treated as flaws by the jury if they don\u2019t
    have any additional information other than the letterforms.\r\n\r\nOr, if I don\u2019t
    have anything interesting to say and/or the design speaks by itself, at least
    I can use that space for mentioning what characters it includes, if it has OT
    features, if it tackles an specific problem, if it is somehow related to some
    historical precedent\u2026 It doesn\u2019t need to be a promotional text, just
    a concise description."

    and I believe it depends. The more innovative a typeface is the more the judges

    is the more it has to speak for itself, and letting the designer explain it might
    actually do harm.\r\n\r\n* Which might not (and in fact usually cannot) involve

    I refuse to participate in these shenanigans: some tossers hold an \"awards ceremony\"
    to glorify and honor nominees. You do all the work, you get nominated, and they
    expect you to travel to their venue and pay for a hotel room at your expense.
    The phenomenon itself, the business of shelling out awards revolves around the
    recipients. Without typeface designers no type design awards can be bestowed.
    On that basis the whole thing is a bucket of horse excrement.\r\n\r\nThey need
    us more than we need them, and they are not getting one piece of me. And now we
    are expected to provide written justification for the things we create? You have

    for the point of each entry they should not be judges in a design competition.
    stoopid. If they don't realize the point of each piece they are unqualified and
    unfit to serve as judges, stoopid. If the judges can't see the puspose of a typographic
    design straight off by looking at it then they are thick.\r\n\r\nHrant, if you
    reply to this post by way of arguments against me as a person, those arguments
    will count for nothing. Counter not me but what I say."

  body: "Certainly the money the winners are charged is put to good use - it's not
    some bizarre punishment. But to me it's somewhat perverse (I know I'm not alone
    in this) and it puts the winner (at least some winners) in an uncomfortable situation.
    I would instead simply charge all entrants a little bit more, avoiding the awkward
    stigma. Would the number of submissions drop? Probably a little bit. But you might
    see the drop offset by a (modest) increase in submissions from non-affluent countries.
    Consider somebody who has to scrounge the submission fee, knowing that if he wins
    he can't afford the hanging fee; he might conclude that the certificate isn't
    worth the submission fee. If he knows there are no \"hidden fees\" he's much more
    likely to submit.\r\n\r\nBTW this is a good opportunity to mention Granshan*.
    Although I'm not comparing it to the TDC in terms of prestige, it's notable that
    the entry fee is minimal (and it used to be totally free) and they've always given
    monetary prizes to winners**. This, from a country that's not at all affluent.
    One way they make it work is that the judging event is quite modest; when I was
    on the jury in 2010 the judging took place in tandem to the ATypI conference,
    with jurors selected from people who were going to be there anyway. Were the results
    compromised? To me it all felt quite robust.\r\n\r\n* http://www.granshan.org/\r\n\r\n**
    Only the venerable Morisawa competition had previously managed that.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW,

    this too little time thing an example from a real type design comp that took place
    somewhere? Maybe it's a hypothetical example. Legato is neither here or there,
    it's just your pet you love to hold up in the air, like doing that makes you look
    clever. It doesn't. If it wasn't for Legato Hrant would have to find some other
    text font to use as a soap box.\r\n\r\nEvery person on this board needs to ask

    never know what the person you insult might do.\r\n\r\n\"That said: Thoughts are
