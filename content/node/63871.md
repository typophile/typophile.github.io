  next to \"Clemens's brackets\" on [[http://books.google.com/books?id=fhWM805q1ZAC&pg=PR39&dq=%22clemens's+brackets%22&ei=U7zxSvyKKIuWlQTSpb2lDA#v=onepage&q=%22clemens's%20brackets%22&f=false|this
  page]]. It doesn't have to be the exact font shown here--I just need a square bracket
  with the little spur on.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n"
