body: "Hi, I have a question concerning choosing a font for an identity system that
  allows as much flexibility as possible for global implementation. The best solve
  we are looking at right now is Frutiger as primary recommended font, with Univers
  as an acceptable substitute because I'm guessing (literally) that Univers has non-western
  characters. But I'm not feeling confident in my recommendation until I have more
  proof.\r\n\r\nIs there a place I can research which fonts have the most range in
  characters?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSailorgrrl"

  body: "The range of language support can also be dependent on the specific version
    of a font you're talking about. You'll also have to be more specific about what
    groups or blocs of non-Westen languages you might be interested in.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    broadly speaking, if you're starting with western languages, there isn't much
    point going much beyond the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic range of writing systems within
    a single font style. Most other writing systems have so little in common with
    these that the idea of having the \"same\" design is no longer very relevant.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I think you'll find Univers more a reference to what early- mid-2oth century
    people of a certain school thought letterforms should look like rather than an
    attempt to describe character compliment.\r\n\r\nWhat you are after could be called
    \"Unicode ranges supported.\" I did a Google search & found\r\n\r\nhttp://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fontsbyrange.html\r\n\r\nbut
    it looks a bit hard to use. I've seen a bar graph presentation somewhere, just
    can't remember where. I think Ariel has wide character support, as did the now
    withdrawn Bitstream Cyberbit. Bear in mind that \"character support\" is different
    than actually being able to write with the typeface."
