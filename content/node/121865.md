body: "I'm currently experimenting with the best position to set anchors in an OpenType
  font.\r\n\r\nNow, when I ask the app Glyphs to place my anchors, it takes the width
  of the total letter, and set the anchor in the middle of the width.\r\nAnd it does
  the same for the punctuation.\r\n\r\nBut when the punctuation (automatically) is
  merged on the letter, this default behaviour does not always result in the best
  combination: some punctuation has to shift to the left, other to the right.\r\n\r\nAre
  there some guidelines for the best placing of the anchors or is it totally up to
  the taste of the designer? (Read; the designers eye...)"

    the anchors along the Y axis to their correct position (ie: optically centered)"

    font (Paul D. Hunt, Adobe).

    (Cmd-Shift-A), and your anchor will be centered horizontally between them. '
