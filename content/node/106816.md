body: "Williams Caslon Small is my new text font for small sizes that I did for the
  partial redesign (as of Sept 23) of The New Yorker. Its proportions are based on
  Caslon's original Long Primer size, and the shapes are based on my Williams Caslon
  Text (for 10-12 point), already published by Font Bureau.  \r\n\r\nAttached is a
  comparison of the old and new. The old was Sabon I believe at 8/8, negatively tracked,
  which was pretty taxing to read. Mine is set at 8/9, also negatively tracked, by
  20 units. I think mine ideally shouldn't be negatively tracked more than 10 even
  in such a narrow column, but it still works, and is much more comfortable a read.
  You have to actually see this in print for a real comparison, but I'm gratified
  that so far it's had a very positive reception. \r\n\r\nTNY creative director Wyatt
  Mitchell explains the ideas behind the redesign in [[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/09/redesigning-the-goings-on-about-town-section.html|this
  video.]]\r\n\r\nThe redrawing of the iconic New Yorker titling face Irvin, with
  additional raised characters and ligatures, [[http://www.houseind.com/showandtell/2013/09/19/HouseIndustriesfortheNewYorker|was
  done by Ben Kiel of House Industries.]] Christian Schwartz also apparently did some
  modifications of his Neutraface (also published by House Industries) for the redesign. "

    the Art Deco era vibe that Irvin and Neutraface carry.\r\n\r\nApart from misplaced
    historical allusion, it\u2019s rather high-minded and didactic (to quote from
    the review of <em>The Butler</em> shown above) and lacking in glamour, especially
    in Bill\u2019s readability-\uFB01rst treatment.\r\nSomething less of a workhorse,
    with a bit more style, would suit the <em>New Yorker</em> more, IMO.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I do like what I\u2019ve seen of the Irvin shenanigans, and perhaps the plainness
    of the body text can complement the visual interest there\u2014I\u2019ll keep

  body: From a readability perspective, this surely seems an improvement. But stylistically
    I think the redesign is a bit of a dog's breakfast. Let me be clear that I've
    never liked <em>The New Yorker</em>, and the precious Art Deco-isms are one of
    the things that turn me off. But if they're going to stick with those artifacts,
    then they should have conviction. Now the display typography and the text seem
    to belong to different publications.

  body: "I definitely think that Williams Caslon Small is a beautiful typeface, and
    the change is definitely an improvement from a readability standpoint.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    Nick Shinn is also correct in noting that the <em>New Yorker</em> aims at a sort
    of Art Deco look. Caslon still fits that better than a lot of other typefaces
    would, so it's not a total miss, but there indeed likely could have been better
    choices.\r\n\r\nOr could there? When I try to think of an Art Deco face, what
    comes to mind are faces like Kabel, which are sans-serif, and not ideally suited
    for body copy. Still, Sabon did seem to fit the \"look\"; could its readability
    have been improved, or could it have been replaced by a different, slightly bolder,
    Garamond (as well as adding one point of leading) with a similar result from a
    readability standpoint?"

  body: "Thanks, all, for the kind words.\r\n\r\nA little context for my Anglo-Canadian
    friends, Nick Shinn and John Hudson. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, my scan is only of
    one corner of the page. Much of the page is text, so the decorative elements of
    the new version of Irvin and the drawings function as more of a punctuation on
    the page, and dominate it less than in my scan. \r\n\r\nSecond, some historical
    context. When The New Yorker was founded in 1925 Rea Irvin, their first art director,
    drew the whimsical all caps titling face they use (based on contemporary lettering,
    as the video indicates), and chose the then new (1923) Linotype Caslon Old Face
    for everything else. Ever since then, The New Yorker has stayed loyal to Caslon,
    and their unique display face, which they now call Irvin. \r\n\r\nThe look Irvin
    created paired the whimsy of his display face with the sober but amiable Caslon.
    The two typefaces are indeed quite a contrast. But it is a contrast that has visually
    branded the magazine for 88 years, and is loved by its readers, who now number
    over a million every week. It may be a look that has lasted the longest of any
    magazine still in print. The freehand whimsy of Irvin also is a visual bridge
    to the many freehand illustrations in every issue, and its famous one-panel cartoons,
    always captioned in Caslon Italic. The two contrasting feelings of Irvin and Caslon
    somehow manage to visually work with both serious reporting and weekly short stories
    from the most renowned US writers, as well as humorous pieces and the cartoons.
    \r\n\r\nSo the current redesign wanting to stick with Caslon is certainly neither
    odd nor unhistorical. In fact, their having used Sabon for the listings for a
    time was, in my view, the odd and unhistorical choice.  \r\n\r\nAs to the redesign,
    I had nothing to do with it except completing my Caslon Small for the listings.
    If anyone asked me, I'm sure I would offer tweaks, including what Karsten suggests,
    spacing out the Neutraface Caps. And though I am a great admirer of Neutraface
    and of Christian Schwartz's work generally, I'd rather see it be all Caslon and
    Irvin, as in the original. (I recently looked at editions from 1929-30, which
    I found quite wonderful.) \r\n\r\nHowever, I still think the current redesign
    works quite well. It also serves their new design purpose. Since everyone can
    check listings on their smart phone, they wanted to emphasize their beautifully
    written cultural critiques and commentary, and the new more continuously readable
    look serves that. \r\n\r\nFinally, a word on Art Deco. To me, the interwar period
    in the 20th century is America's best, as far as decorative arts, along with the
    neo-classical period of American Federalism. It is also very characteristic of
    the best of New York City style. Maybe it is a weakness that I like it so much,
    but if so it is a weakness I share with a lot of my countrymen.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    certainly relates to the historicist era of American design, which is when the
    magazine originated\u2014and the Regency dude. There was too an overlap with Art
    Deco. So the choice of Caslon is indeed appropriate to the magazine\u2019s historical
    branding. However, I do feel that the Linotype Caslon had a bit more style than
    any phototype/digital versions since. The present setting is cramped and grey
    in tone, whereas the Old Face had space and sparkle:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Caslon_5413.png]\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:
    Like Bill, I have a great love and respect for American graphics of the early
    20th century, but I am a bit of a purist on historical matters, and prefer to
    see old typefaces set in the manner for which they were designed\u2014in the case
    of Caslon, that would be with a little bit of letterpress bounce, no kerning,
    and most importantly, with no extra character spacing in justi\uFB01ed settings.

  body: "Thanks, Jason!\r\n\r\nThe wide word spacing in Nick's scan comes, as I understand
    it, from a combination of the way the Linotype machine operated, and the pressures
    on compositors. As [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine#Justification|the
    wikipedia article explains]], the Linotype machine put a wedge between words,
    when compositor hit the space bar. Then when a line was complete, the machine
    would in push the wedges to expand the spaces to fill out the line and justify
    it. A lazy compositor could do less hyphenation, and just let the machine justify
    the line by shoving the word spaces out wider. This is the kind of thing that
    Geoffrey Dowding excoriated in his 1954 book <em>Finer Points in the Spacing and
    arrangement of type</em>. In the subsequent phototype era, the pendulum swung
    the other way. \r\n\r\nThe wide letter spacing in Linotype Caslon Old Face was
    a deliberate choice by the designers at the Linotype company, and was probably
    determined by Chauncy Griffith, who was overseeing the production of fonts at
    the time. The letter spacing may be a little wider than the original Caslon Long
    Primer typeface, but the original letter spacing is also very wide compared to
    what is common today \u2013 at least judging by the sample in Caslon's 1766 specimen
    book. Most likely it was Griffith's attempt to be 'pure,' in the sense of being
    true to the look of the original, as much as he could, given the limitations of
    the Linotype machine.\r\n\r\n     "

    PageMaker (I did this for the Aldus Corporation, maker of PageMaker, but it was
    a technical comparison, not a promotional piece), looking under the hood of both
    programs\u2019 composition engines, I discovered that, no matter how you set the
    defaults, QuarkXPress would invoke letter-spacing too early in the decision tree
    of its H&J. In PageMaker, if you set all the letter-spacing values (Minimum, Optimum,
    Maximum) to zero, the only time you\u2019d see any letter-spacing to justify was
    when a line contained only a single word. (At that point, <em>something</em> has

    first started using QuarkXPress to set its type when you would see horrendous
    letter-spacing throughout the narrow typeset columns. They fixed the defaults
    within a few issues, but the legacy of that letter-spacing still lives in the
    <em>New Yorker</em> today, two decades later.\r\n"
