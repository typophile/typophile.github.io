  work on here but here we go...\r\nI am designing a logo for a small record label
  and thought here would be the best place to get expert opinions.\r\nThe labels releases
  mainly nu-folk bands. So I thought an organic vintage script would a good choice.\r\nI
  would be so grateful if you could point me in the right direction for improvements.
  \r\nI am no logo designer therefore any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind
  regards\r\n\r\nPJ\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/safetyfirst_6618.jpg]"

  body: Incorporating the type in the safety pin seems forced, not only because the
    type doesn't look anything like bent metal -- even if it did, bending a safety
    pin even once is a pain in the ass. Nevertheless, it's a strong symbol with a
    distinct skeleton. I would look for type that reflected it's shape somehow. Everyone
    can't be an expert in all matters, so don't be afraid of utilizing the expertise
    of a type savvy designer.

  body: "Thanks loads,\r\n\r\nI wasn't actually thinking about the realistic or tangible
    \ aspect of the pin. Thank you for bringing it up.\r\nI'll bare it in consideration.
    maybe I should look for a font that looks more \"wirey\" but I'm worried it will
    then look a bit too childish.\r\nI have experimented with text forming the \"body\"
    of the pin and have come up with a few variation or the below example.\r\nUnfortunately
    I feel the safety pin head doesn't read as much anymore. It has also lost it's
    organic \"folksy\" feel. But I do like the half disk closing off the logo and
    giving the whole thing a sense of inclosed safety/security.\r\nGuess that's me
    going back to the drawing board!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nPJ\r\n"

  body: "The first one is perfect!\r\nBut I'm not sure about \"records\" -- is it
    necessarily part of the mark?\r\nAt any rate, it might be better in all caps,
    and I would experiment with where to put it in relation to the logo, in various
    layouts, especially the business card, which is the most difficult piece of corporate
    design."

  body: I see a play on "records" in the left portion of the safety pin, it looks
    like half a disc/vinyl. Maybe some breathing room between the text and the shapes
    on either side and it looks great.

  body: I'm not seeing the safety pin as well in the 2nd example - maybe because there's
    no thin pin/wire part anymore. I think they both have a lot of potential though.
    I would just keep experimenting with pencil and paper, drawing lots of variations.
    And I think Matt is referring to the right side of the pin, not the left.
