  body: "The sample is a bit small and low-res for a 100% positive ID.\r\n\r\nI think
    I'm seeing a little curve at the very base of the leg of the R. If it isn't my
    imagination, then Knockout No. 27 Junior Bantamweight by Hoefler & Co. should
    work:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/styles/\r\n\r\nMonopol Medium
    and Franklin Gothic Book Extra Compressed are also very close. "

    1960/1980 might work but can't state if it's the one. More in the same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/libel-suit|Label
