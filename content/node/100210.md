  body: As almost all letterings coming from Nike, it could be a proprietary typeface.
    If I had to recreate it, I would probably start with some font like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/canby/|Canby]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/liquorstore/|Liquorstore]]/[[http://www.letterbox.net.au/berber|Berber]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hipopotam/olifant/|Olifant]]/[[http://www.peter-wiegel.de/Fonts/index.html|Berlin
    Email]] and rework the all thing.

  body: "Why the hell is that, Hrant? Herr Wiegel offers revivals of lots of old Deutsche
    typefaces - some of which are available nowhere else digitally. I'm <em>grateful</em>
    that people like him exist. A niche typographer with with some really cool offerings
    from the past. Making fonts few people care about any more.\r\n\r\nI am fascinated
    to know the reason for your gastrointestinal distress (AKA \"gut feeling\"). Is
    it the crappy website? Erm ... highly suspicious. Something else?\r\n\r\nThis
    guy is a commercial type person, too. Small-time and with weak website development
    skills? Yep. Does he deserve your totally unsupported disdain on a public forum?
    Nope. An apology is what Herr Wiegel deserves (yeah, right ... ).\r\n\r\nFolks
    - I would think twice before listening to Hrant asking <em>you</em> to think twice.
    <em>Demand</em> at least some shred of supporting evidence."

  body: "Definitely ask for an explanation (I only hold that back to save time - favoring
    instead merely the raising of a red flag) but <em>evidence</em> is often too much
    to expect. People don't typically make decisions -especially not important ones,
    like who to marry- based on hard evidence; people don't tread cautiously -which
    is all I'm asking- because they're <em>sure</em> something is wrong. And it's
    a fruitful act of humility to admit that somebody else's experience/instincts
    are superior to yours when it comes to smelling rotten fish; just like I have
    the humility to freely admit that I suck at IDing fonts, and sometimes that does
    indeed cause me trouble.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case I'm seeing enough similarities
    between many of Wiegel's fonts and other existing commercial designs to simply
    suggest that people do more research. If somebody does the research and comes
    to believe all his work is legitimate, that's not a wasted effort - they can feel
    more comfortable supporting him, and they can tell others about their findings.
    Have you done the research?\r\n\r\nIn fact, Wiegel, being an actual type designer
    (unlike virtually everybody IDing fonts...) might appreciate the sort of caution
    I'm expressing, and elect to merely reassure people that he's not one of the <em>majority</em>
    of people who produce a large number of fonts dishonorably.\r\n\r\nBTW Mike, I'm
    better at apologizing that most people I know, and most people here, and you.
    You need to be paying more attention to how my efforts have helped people here
    be more mindful of not hurting type designers. I can tell because I'm having to
    intervene far less often now than 2-3 weeks ago.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
