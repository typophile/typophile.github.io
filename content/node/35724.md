body: You are the first to hear it, outside of the official announcement on Saturday
  in Seattle. TypeCon2008 will be held in Buffalo, New York, July 16-20, 2008. Buffalo
  is home to our dear friends at P22 type foundry, is close to our great pals at the
  Type Club of Toronto, and is a city full of incredible architecture (thank you,
  Frank Lloyd Wright), the Roycrofters in the region, and a cultural renaissance suited
  to all appreciators of the fine arts, contemporary music, innovative architecture,
  and design. We are back at a Hyatt, which we loved in Boston, and look forward to
  a fantastic event in the Buffalo-Niagara region.

    will just postpone the passport requirement to cross the border for one more year...

    a planning meeting in two weeks. Anyone interested in attending, email me offlist.

    true, partly because you see trees and parkways from the Canadian side and you
    see towers, casinos and Clifton Hill from The US side. (This is Niagara Falls
    in case anyone is still wondering). Both sides of the Falls have their charms
    and their downsides. A local guide of off the beaten path things to do on both
    sides of the US/CA border will be made available in the coming months."
