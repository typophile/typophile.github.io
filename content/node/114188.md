  body: "Waschinrichting Washing device?\r\nWall lettering in 1911 was based on the
    imagination of the person doing the sign., who may or may not have made reference
    to a book on lettering.\r\nAs for digital fonts the square structure and diagonal
    on the S resembles Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm's Teuton, which is  inspired by a
    tombstone inscription on one German grave in northern Bohemia http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/teuton/\r\nAlso

  body: "You're welcome Peter-Paul. Very impressive facade for a laundry. I didn't
    comment on the angled stroke on the R.  This was a feature of some 19th century
    fonts. Also found on the P. Both letters were common on stock certificate lettering.
    For a font with this effect see LHF Old Stock https://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/oldstock.php.
    Cut off the spikes on Old Stock and you are in the ball park, but too wide. Anyway,
    fairly easy to replicate from scratch.\r\nDon"
