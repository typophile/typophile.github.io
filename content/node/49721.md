body: "Hello !!!\r\n\r\nI would like to embedded a font thanks Flash CS3, in order
  to get a .swf that handle the italic and bold korean font (is possible, one that
  looks like lucida for the latin characters). I've tried several that seemed to handle
  the korean but each time I end with square characters when I test it :( Furthermore
  I couldn't find the fonts given in this post (http://typophile.com/node/19036)\r\nDoes
  somebody has an idea where I could find a character table or directly which font
  use for korean or where to find .swf ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot !!"

  body: "this maybe be related to your problem:\r\n\r\nwhen embedding fonts in flash,
    you must make flash aware of which character set to embed.\r\nUnder the properties
    panel, you'll find an 'embed' button, click that, and korean glyphs are listed
    beneath japanese, basic latin etc etc. Ensure you are exporting these glyphs when
    you test.\r\n\r\nApple's Myungjo should have the relevant glyph set, for a test
    at least.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    .. Ans I did it ! Since, my korean characters are not all corectly displyed..
    Apple's Myungjo either. Only the Arial Unicode MS works but apparently it's a=n
    awful display for korean people and futhermore bold is not included. \r\nSo I
    keep trying.. :("

    this note tho: http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=42f4a853\r\n\r\nOther
    people note the 'squares' issue. One solution was to try exporting a flash 9 file,
    rather than 8 to solve it.\r\n\r\n"
