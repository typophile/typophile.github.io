  thread after another having all my questions asked and answered for me. But there
  is one one subject i havent been able to find an ansver to... \r\n\r\nMy problem
  at hand drove me to create a profile and step into the light: Hello :)\r\n\r\n\r\nIve
  worked in the graphic design industry for 10+ years or so and I have yet to do a
  typeface. That is about to change - I've set a goal to make a display type, uppercase
  with numurals within a 3 month timeframe. I is important to note that I see all
  this as a learning process and that learning is one of my key motivators.\r\n\r\nAm
  I being overly ambitious? \r\n\r\nDo I underestimate factors like Learning software,
  kerning and finetuning? \r\n\r\nI'll be working on this project alongside my normal
  workload and I know that my skill level, ability to learn software etc. is a huge
  factor but how much time do you usually allocate to your projets? \r\n\r\nI know
  that time will tell if I can meet my deadline or laugh at my own ignorance, but
  for now im just setting up some goals to push myself forward.\r\n\r\nSince this
  is a new process for me I plan is to make some milestones - Any input would be more
  than welcome - So far i have something like this planned out:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Concept
  fase, 5-7 carecters hand drawn or Illustrator to determine the overall style\r\n\r\n2.
  Reversion\r\n\r\n3. Fontlab learning, reading playing  \r\n\r\n4. Carecter redraw
  (or copy from Illustrator and finetune) in fontlab\r\n\r\n5. Reversion\r\n\r\n6.
  Design rest of carecters\r\n\r\n7. Design numurals\r\n\r\n8. Fine tuning\r\n\r\n9.
  Kerning, testing, kerning, testing ...\r\n\r\n10. Check up on legal stuff\r\n\r\n11.
  Release (champagne and french fries)\r\n\r\n\r\nAm I on the right track? "

    be too attached to a specific goal or timeline. Put the time in and you will learn.
    Good luck!

  body: Skipping illustrator is all well and good, but depending on the person, sketching
    by hand is generally valuable as a first step. Cheap, quick and gets the ideas
    down in an easily editable form!

    all of the characters out, you can do it virtually anywhere - even laptops have

    title="Jason Santa Maria's Blog">the importance of keeping a sketchbook</a> and
    it is one of the reasons I'm trying to do that with my own work rather than jumping
    straight onto the computer.

  body: "Thank you for your input,\r\n\r\nFirst off - my intention is to start on
    paper (my usual process with most design even though i tend to work very loosly
    in this phase - I have a feeling i need to be more precise with typography) -
    Ill take Kentles advise and get to know my tool of choice first :) \r\n\r\nThank
    you for \"10.5. Create specimen document and interesting samples\" phrostbyte64
    - Im sure I will relish that specifik part of the project. Better half is not
    advised but for her it will just be another one of my nerdy pasttimes ;)\r\n\r\nEben,
    I know everybody underestimates thats why im curious as to how long both amatous
    and pro use - It will help me put things into perspective...  "

  body: "Maybe you don't want to know. :)\r\n\r\nSeriously, I'd say go for it &ndash;
    start out and ride along! Having a voice in the back of your head that's telling
    you what should be a \"normal\" timeframe for this, and what \"stage\" of the
    process you should now be in, might just put too much pressure on you. If this
    is about learning for you, you will need time to play, to explore, to compare,
    and to examine what others have done; to do and re-do. I think if you try to stick
    too closely to a fixed plan you might get frustrated. (FWIW, with my first font
    I ended up making the complete lowercase alphabet three times from scratch until
    I was satisfied with the shapes and proportions. I'm not saying that's normal!
    But it can happen to a beginner, and I think is much better than feeling you \"have\"
    to stop because you don't have any time left, even if you're not satisfied.)\r\n\r\nNote
    that you left out spacing in your plan. As far as I understand things (and I'm
    still a beginner as well), it's very important to get spacing down as far as possible
    before starting out with kerning. \r\nBut anyway, I'd question if type design
    is really such a linear process as your chart suggests. :)"
