  body: "Wish I could, but I'd need a pensieve... and, sadly, this isn't a Potterverse.\r\n\r\nSo
    here is what happened: I was looking at the Behance image and thinking about where
    I could see Ruslan in real life. And right then, this image appeared in my mind:
    A close-up of a trunk lid on what looked like a bright red luxury sedan with the
    name in moulded, chromed Ruslan. My mind is just weird like that.\r\n\r\nRL incident:
    I was reading a story some years ago and had fallen into a flow state where my
    eyes picked up the text on the screen and my mind immediately translated it into
    a full movie. Then... my sister knocked on the door, announcing dinner. It took
    me quite a few minutes to recover from the crash."
