body: Through online forums like [[Speak Up]], publications, workshops, seminars,
  discussions over coffee and biscotti or simple arguments while waiting for the bus,
  UnderConsideration strives to strengthen the notion of Graphic Design as a political,
  social, economical and culturally relevant profession among graphic designers. Its
  purpose is to question, push, analyze and agitate Graphic Design acknowledging it
  as a fun, creative profession that lets us play with color, size, shape, paper,
  texture, but more importantly with actions, reactions and emotions. We do work that
  affects the world in unexpected, immeasurable and intangible ways and it is our
  obligation to accept such responsibility. UnderConsideration is at the moment run
  by [[Bryony Gomez-Palacio]] and [[Armin Vit]].
