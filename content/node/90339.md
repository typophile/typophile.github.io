body: "Our company is being re-branded. We haven\u2019t received a style guide yet
  but have been told in advance that all non-headline text - print as well as online
  - is to be in Verdana. The only example of long-form print copy being set in Verdana
  I can think of is from Ikea, where it looks brutal or anti-design - e.g. their Yearly
  Summary at http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/facts_and_figures/yearly_summary.html
  . Anyway, that PDF may be read online; we have to produce some print-only documents.
  I\u2019ve shown the Ikea example to the designers and they say they would be happy
  with that sort of look on our print work.\r\n\r\nHas anyone got any examples of
  Verdana working successfully as print body copy - or is it (as I suspect) a non-starter
  borne out of a \u2018print is dead\u2019 mindset?"

  body: In scalable font formats, what does "too large on the body to work well" mean?
    (I.e., what remains of the "too large" problem if you just lower the point size?)

  body: "> what remains of the \"too large\" problem if you just lower the point size?\r\n\r\nNice
    way to put the question. \"Too large on the body\"\r\neffectively means the x-height
    and/or the width (usually\r\nmore the former) are too great. What \"remains\"
    when you\r\nlower the point size is too great a reliance on letterform\r\nbodies
    (x-height region) which are only good at making\r\nindividual letters easier to
    see, hence decipher; in contrast \r\nthe extenders (which lose out when the x-height
    is too great)\r\nhelp extended reading. Here's a -simplified- explanation:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html\r\nSee
    the rightmost image if you'd like to cut to the chase.\r\n\r\nThis is a classic
    issue, and the reason that newspaper\r\nfonts are large on the body while book
    fonts are small.\r\nNevermind that no ideal text fonts are sans...\r\n\r\nBTW,
    Verdana is also too loose to promote comfortable\r\nextended reading in print.
    Onscreen is a different story,\r\nin fact there Verdana is basically a one-pixel-looser\r\nversion
    of Tahoma because the latter -which is nothing\r\nmore than a [good] UI font-
    is way too tight for extended\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
