  body: Offhand the only digital version I know was in the Expresiv Fonts Photo Lettering
    Font Collection. The fonts were supposed to be &#39;Copyright 1994 FontBank&#39;,
    but  this  does not appear at the usual FontBank &#40;BuyFonts&#41; site. I recall
    having to accept a special copyright license agreement, because these were licensed
    from the PhotoLettering collection.

  body: <a href="http://www.atomictype.co.uk/fontco_n-z.html" target="_blank">Atomic
    Type</a> still carries the Font Company fonts, which includes FC Novel Gothic.
    That would be the only other digital version I have found.  <BR> <BR>Of course,
    such fonts have a way of becoming &#39;freeware&#39; with new names, but you&#39;re
    on your own there.

  body: Font company also had a Novel Gothic. I assume it was the same typeface. Don&#39;t
    know where you can buy it but <a href="http://www.atomictype.co.uk/fontco_n-z.html"
    target="_blank">here</a>.  Incidently Novel Gothic is also the typeface used in
    the Clue movie poster.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70908.gif"
