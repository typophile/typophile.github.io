  body: One great source for free fonts is DaFont. Unfortunately their server seems
    to be having trouble at the moment, but <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=506">here&#39;s
    a link</a> to their collection of graffiti-influenced fonts. You may find yours
    in there.

  body: If I'm not mistaken, this is one of the only legitimate graff fonts out there.
    An artist by the name of Crayone from San Francisco made this atleast a decade
    ago...I could be wrong though.

  body: "Just a suggestion - if you're going to get a graffiti style tattoo, don't
    use a graffiti font. Get it custom lettered by a real graffiti artist. Your tattoo
    artist probably knows a few, or may even be one him/herself. It will look a lot
    better, and be one of a kind.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    a hand style master, and a cool guy. He can probably sketch up some good compositions.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.grimemonster.com\">Grime</a>(AWR) and <a href=\"http://www.mikegiant.com/\">Giant</a>
    are also really good tat artists that used to write. Or if you want characters
    <a href=\"http://www.markbode.com/site/tattoos.html\">Mark Bode</a> is part of
    the legendary family that influenced a large amount of NYC subway graff in the
    late 70's, early 80's.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are tons more. Be careful of those
    tat artists that \"say\" they used to be writers..."
