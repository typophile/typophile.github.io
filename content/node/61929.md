  body: "\"The S is quite different from the English Grotesque\u2019s S.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    missed the word \"similar\" in my post. The C in English Grotesque is also very
    different.\r\nI thought that smongery may be looking for something with the same
    character.\r\n"

  body: Underground from P22 is VERY similar to Johnston. The distinct diamond dot
    on the 'i' in the Johnston family is the same in Underground, as is the g and
    y similar...
