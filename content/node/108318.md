  across browsers, searched all over the web for good articles but still nothing.\r\n\r\nI
  don't have time to really study and understand font rendering right now, but I need
  to find what fonts I can use. Fonts that, even if they display differently across
  browsers, still look good (not creepy).\r\n\r\n1) Can you guys list the fonts you
  know look good on the popular browsers?\r\nI mean IE8+, Chrome, Safari, Firefox
  (including mobile versions).\r\n\u2192 Preferrably Google Web Fonts.\r\n\r\n2) Do
  you know a website focused on this issue (crossbrowser type)?\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

  body: "This is a HUGE subject and there isn't one answer because webfont rendering
    depends of multiple things like :\r\n\r\n- Caracteristics of the screen itself
    (luminosity, contrast and of course resolution)\r\n- Font-size (small font size
    increase type rendering issue on low resolution screens)\r\n- Characters shape
    specificities (Contrast, Aperture, Counter, x-Height etc.) \r\n- Quality of hinting
    / kerning\r\n- Operating system text-rendering engine (CoreTxt, DirectWrite, GDI+,
    Cleartype, GDI etc.)\r\n- Browser text-rendering engine (Webkit, Blink, Gecko
    etc.)\r\n(note : some browsers rendering overlay the OS rendering)\r\n- Custom
    User preferences (Anti-aliasing options)\r\n\r\nTo go deeper, you could take a
    look to <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/05/type-rendering-on-the-web/\">this
    serie of blog posts</a> on Typekit. It's a bit old (already 3 years now)  but
    still interresting !\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, for body-copy you could try to follow these
    good practices (there are no rule) :\r\n\r\n- Font-size not to small : 13px +\r\n-
    Comfortable line-height : 1.3 +\r\n- Low-contrast shapes\r\n- Well hinted/kerned
    typefaces\r\n- Line lenght not too long 60 char. max (or so).\r\n\r\nAn off course,
    TEST the rendering in various environments (different OS + Browsers) using either
    your own material or Virtual Machines (ex. <a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/fr/\">Parallel
    Desktop</a>) or web solutions (ex. <a href=\"http://www.browserstack.com/\">Browserstack</a>).
    I'm also a huge fan of <a href=\"http://typecast.com/\">Typecast</a> which is,
    in my opinion, the best web service available yet, to build layouts and compare
    webfonts.\r\n\r\nConcerning the choice of Google webfonts I would maybe add <a
    href=\"http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto\">Roboto</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans\">PT
    Sans</a> to the other one which have been given before.\r\n\r\nI hope it will
    help you.\r\n\r\n--\r\n<em>Note: If you can read the french language, I've written

  body: "On the question of the Benton RE font, I see the high end of its size spectrum
    being less useful than the lower end of its size spectrum, where it's best. I'm
    glad you think Benton Sans elegant, but I'm not sure 13 px is a place to judge
    such a trait.\r\n\r\n The width issue comes to a head, i.e. how wide is the regular
    weight, when the family is committed to a bold that is to render well unhinted
    down to 9 px. I felt that these bold styles had to be widened from the print versions
    for the smallest uses, unlike most web bold styles, and the regular must follow
    or be too narrow. So if you look at the smart screen companion bold face of Whitney,
    vs Verdana, or any RE fonts at 9-10 px, you see a bold face you might wish was
    larger and wider. The carpet only moves, it doesn't stretch.\r\n\r\nFor the future,
    we have intermediate plans, but while new low tech solutions are being rattled
    about, we need to see if these or any better standards will be moving onto the
    web, allowing more refined optically-sized service of this and other font families. "

    with the inflated width (as well as making the \"g\" monocular). But that was
    not done \u2013 possibly for reasons that are not observable without considering
    \"relativity\", as you nicely explain WRT the Bold. I wonder though whether making

    I look again?\r\n\r\nBeyond a doubt you've looked at way more small type than
    I have... but every single small type I've seen has seriously shortened descenders
    \u2013 and in general any text type has descenders shorter than ascenders (for
    very good reason). The fact that Benton Sans (13 px) has descenders equal to ascenders
    (both in the regular and the RE) gives it more elegance (which I think makes sense
    in terms of mood and differentiation, especially in the context of so few pixels)
    but my point was that the RE's extra width \u2013and the mono \"g\"\u2013 go against
    that (and I myself would prefer seeing a small* sacrifice in the quality of the
    Bold, and only at very small sizes).\r\n\r\n* I'm assuming.\r\n\r\nI think the
    bottom line \u2013and the heart of Alex's complaint\u2013 is that Benton Sans
    RE is looking too much like a \"generic\" screen font, versus what most designers
    \u2013who hopefully choose a font based on its mood and not just its readability\u2013

    end this is what matters most when picking a font for the online use. Readability
    is important, no doubt, but it's secondary.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the RE version
    of Benton Sans is that it's so detached from the original in how it looks and
