  body: "I love the mark. Very sexy. However, the only logo that really integrates
    the type and the mark well is #2. The others seem as though the type is a completely
    separate element.\r\n\r\nIn the logos you've created, I'm reading \"Black\" as
    one idea and \"Blue Ball\" as a second idea, and I keep wondering why the circle
    (ball) isn't blue. I believe \"Black & Blue\" should be read as one single phrase
    (unless \"blue ball\" is some sort of pun re fetishism).\r\n\r\nThe ampersand
    in logo 1 is my favourite. It reflects the whip from the mark well. As for typeface
    suggestions: I'll have to mull it over a bit more.\r\n\r\nGreat job so far.\r\n\r\n

    body: "Thanks for your input. \r\nI have the mark separated in most of the comps
      because the mark will probably be used on it's own a fair bit, and I don't think
      the type has the same impact when that small or curved like that. But I'm certainly
      open to it going in that direction if the type works with it. \r\nIt definitely
      should read as Black and Blue Ball, no puns though it certainly does present
      like that. And the colours are not really final, I haven't found a blue I really
      like to use as the primary colour that isn't overpowering while still being
      strong.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what I'm going for as far as typefaces for
      this logo. I like the bold strong letters, but I think a strong bold cursive
      might be good too."

    type treatments, i am currently not feeling any of the above. As a matter of fact,
    I believe that you don't have to be very adventurous in the type at all. A bold,
    clean sans serif set over 2-3 lines on the right should be sufficient. Maybe try
    using the blue colour for \"BLUE\". Anyway, good luck with the project. I am looking
    forward to seeing how this will turn out.\r\n\r\nSeb"

    the graphic more explicit and make the title more engaging its too bland.\r\n\r\nIdeas:
    turn the shoe sideways, so it says shoe and then the whip will add to the illustration.
    Add the \"Fetish\" as a eyebrow to your headline \"Black and Blue Ball\" \r\n"

    is heavy and is bound to dominate the lettering (apologies, no puns intended).
    The success or failure of the mark relies on scale and proportion of the type
    to the image, in your last version I wonder of the intended viewer would swiftly
    recognise the illustration at that size. Have you tried a black boot on a blue
    or white background? Possibly viewed from the side (which would make the subject
    more obvious), something like this perhaps\r\nhttp://www.thevincerayexperience.com/mugs.html\r\n\r\nThe
    Kada version achieves some balance, it could be even larger in proportion to the

  body: "I'd suggest playing up the \"black and blue\" in the logo a bit more, extending
    the whip or boot a bit to divide the shape of the circle and make half of it entirely
    blue. Get kind of a yin-yang thing going on. Or else, maybe a blue crescent drop
    shadow. As unpopular as such things are, in this case it would create a suggestive
    visual pun of \"balls\", at least one of which is blue.\r\n\r\nI think the script
    font is heading in the right direction (re: #2 from your sample of 19 January,
    2007 - 6:12pm), but it is a bit too light and formal. I found something I think
    would be perfect on <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/the-king-queen-font.font\">dafont.com</a>,
