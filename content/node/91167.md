  been playing around with / trying to learn PostScript.  Through some reverse-engineering
  I've been able to create TTF fonts (Quadratic Bezier Curves... blargh), and even
  OTF fonts with the Compact Font Format, by editing the CharString entries in the
  CFFFont table.  A little tedious to do by hand, but I like it.  All fine so far.\r\n\r\nWhat
  i'd really like to do is use full PostScript to define characters in the font...
  for example, using strokes and line widths, which isn't possible with CFF.  All
  the fonts I find seem to be PostScript Level 2 - which I believe means they use
  CFF.  \r\n\r\nIs there a font format that uses full PostScript, as opposed to CFF?
  \ Can somebody point me to an example file?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm learning as I
  go here, so there is the possibility that my question doesn't make sense.  But at
  any rate, commentary from more knowledgeable individuals would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n::Matt"

  body: "Type 3 fonts can use everything Postscript can (oh, perhaps not issue an
    \"endpage\"). But support for these is rapidly dwindling -- <em>if</em> not already
    entirely gone --,  as it requires the font-using software to implement an entire
    Postscript interpreter.\r\n\r\nYou are mixing up various parts of font technology,
    by the way. Postscript fonts do not use \"Postscript Level 2\"; they use a (very
    limited) subset of the original Postscript. Not a single Level 2 feature anywhere.
    The \"Type 2\" of CharStrings have nothing to do with Postscript levels.\r\n\r\nThere
    are good reasons <em>not</em> to use line widths in a font, as a fixed line width
    would not change with the point size. There is a font Fill type that was meant
    to have single strokes as font definition, but the problems with these were so
    great it has also been removed from the official specification years ago.\r\n\r\nIf
    all you want is train yourself with Postscript (and not particularly with fonts)
    , you should find a download of GhostScript. I learned Postscript programming
    by talking to a LaserWriter using modem software, but its modern variant, Acrobat
    Distiller, doesn't come with interactive features. If I'm correct, GhostScript
    still does, meaning you can interactively build up anything you like and see it
    appear on the screen."

  body: "When people refer to PostScript fonts, they are almost always referring to
    Type 1 fonts.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to have fun, I suggest that you reference
    the [[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF|Adobe Type
    1 Font Format]], then use the [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html|AFDKO]]
    <em>type1</em> and <em>detype1</em> tools to compile and decompile Type 1 fonts.
    You can start by using the AFDKO <em>tx</em> tool to convert one of your existing
    fonts (\"font.cff\" in the command line below) into a Type 1 font:\r\n\r\n<code>%
    tx -t1 font.cff font.pfa</code>\r\n\r\nThen, use the <em>detype1</em> tool to
    decompile the Type 1 font into human-readable/editable form:\r\n\r\n<code> % detype1
    font.pfa font.txt</code>"

  body: "So, yes, using the full power of PostScript means using Type 3 fonts, which
    can only print to a PostScript device, and won't be WYSIWYG on screen, and at
    best will work in only some apps, and only on the Mac. Not really a good idea
    in this day and age, unless it's just for fun and you know it will work in the
    specific operating environment you want to use.\r\n\r\nEdit: of course you can
    also use Type 3 fonts and even get WYSIWYG if you have a NeXT computer.  :)"

    some stuff was just off... always helps to ask some experts.\r\n\r\nAs a result
    I think i'll stick with the outlining mechanism that the CFF provides.\r\n\r\nThank
    you!"
