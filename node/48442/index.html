  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Our small weekly newspaper is cutting our web dramatically at the first of the year.
We are currently 13&quot; wide and moving to 11&quot;
The newspaper hasn&rsquo;t gone through a redesign in 20+ years, so we are going to redesign while going smaller.
We are attempting to find a good combination of fonts to use. We are currently strictly Times throughout the paper.
In our text we use 10 pt with 9.6 leading. We are aware this is way too tight. Is there a font that fits more characters on each line at a decent price? (We are a small family owned weekly)
Or is there a way to manipulate Times so that it is still usable and we take our resources to purchase updated Headline/Section front fonts?
Does anyone have any suggestions on good combos of serif and sans serif fonts for headlines a small weekly paper on a budget? and also the good text font question.
Thanks!!!

<p>Times on the left, 10/9.6, 10 pica column.
<a href="http://www.shinntype.com/worldwide.html">Worldwide</a> on the right, 8.6/9.6.</p>
<p>Being slightly condensed and with a large x-height, Worldwide fits more text than Times at the same apparent size, justifies better, and no extender collisions. There are also headline versions. <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/brown.html">Brown Gothic</a> is the matching sans.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Font Bureau specializes in helping newspaper clients with just this sort of thing. Although they sometimes engage in custom solutions, there are also a number of off-the-shelf options that they can provide.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/">http://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/</a></p>
<p>I realize you&rsquo;re a small paper and on a budget, and the very idea of FB may sound too expensive (after all, they deal with all the &ldquo;Big Boys&rdquo;), but I&rsquo;d suggest that you have someone at least give Harry Parker a call and find out what kind of ballpark you might be looking at for a FB fonts solution. At worst, you&rsquo;d find that it&rsquo;s not in your budget. At best, you&rsquo;d have an experienced partner to help you find a great, proven solution fast.</p>
<p>I also realize that the powers-that-be have probably dumped all their available cash into the presses and hardware investments, and it&rsquo;s probably too late now, but there really should be some budgetary consideration for the ramifications of the narrower web on design and fonts. The narrower web isn&rsquo;t going to help cut costs so much if the paper just has to get longer to accommodate the old amount of text in Times; nor if the content ends up getting cut noticeably because the design can&rsquo;t adapt adequately to the narrower constraints; nor if the readership drops off because suddenly the whole thing looks and reads like a mess.</p>
<p>In the bigger picture, newspaper fonts are a long-term investment. The cost of high-quality, well-suited fonts to solve your not-insignificant challenge is a drop in the bucket compared to other upfront costs of the transition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably preaching to the choir. Good luck with your transition.</p>
<p>&ndash; Kent.</p>
<p>P.S. Nick&rsquo;s Worldwide and Brown Gothic are also time-tested and excellent options.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Brian, fitting more text in the same space (or the same text in a smaller space) isn&rsquo;t very hard - you just use a (well-made) font with a bigger x-height* and set it at a smaller size. The problem is that you are losing something: readability (just try setting a paragraph in Quadraat Headliner). And in fact Times (even though it&rsquo;s not a font I generally favor) is quite nicely balanced in terms of economy-vs-readability, at least in the point size range that it&rsquo;s comfortable with. The problem is: it&rsquo;s overused, it&rsquo;s bland, and has too much stroke contrast**, plus if you go smaller than 9 point it can&rsquo;t hold the text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Narrower fonts don&rsquo;t necessarily help, and in fact can hurt.
From my Daidala interview (<a href="http://daidala.com/25apr2004.html)">http://daidala.com/25apr2004.html)</a>:
&ldquo;The other thing to consider about width is economy. We might think that narrowness is economical – and that’s obviously true at the level of single lines – but a paragraph is not a bunch of single lines, it’s a series of lines; a wider font can be set smaller, maintaining apparent size, and gaining vertical space in a paragraph. Furthermore, a wide &amp; small font is less susceptible to the “wasting” effect of linebreaks: a narrow font that accumulates small amounts of gain per line can have all its savings trashed by a linebreak; while a smaller font will save space per line no matter the linebreaks. On the other hand, a wider font causes more hyphens (in inverse proportion to the column measure), reducing both readability and economy. So it depends on a number of factors; but it’s important to remember that narrowness isn’t necessarily more economical.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>** Which was fine in the era of massive ink gain, but no longer.</p>
<p>In choosing a font one big task is to decide on a suitable apparent size for your paper&rsquo;s text, based on various things, not least the average age of your readership. There&rsquo;s a limit to how much you can push the juggling act before everything falls to the ground; you can&rsquo;t have easy reading AND long articles AND low cost. Typically you can get to chose two of those three.</p>
<p>I could keep writing, but allow me to cut to the chase: if FontBureau scares you :-) please do get in touch (hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com) either to discuss the development/modification of a font, or for typographic consultation.</p>
