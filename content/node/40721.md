    claims it is not a custom typeface (but then again the typeface he gave me wasn't
    the correct one either)."

  body: I puzzled over this while waiting in a theater lobby recently. (It was printed
    on the side of a large display for a film.) I don't know what it is either (if
    it is a font). I suspect it is a custom or modified font to match the FOCUS logo.
    (I thought the FOCUS logo was AG Old Face, but it's not.)  (Incidentally, the
    Neutraface M is slightly splayed, too.) (Sorry about all the parenthetical remarks.)

  body: "FILMINFOCUS is Neville Brody\u2019 s Insignia, with the cross-stoke removed
    from the F. Or perhaps there is an alternate F in there. Haven't got time to check.
    It's a Linotype font - some Akzidenz Grotesk (see the S) with some Avantgarde
    for geometric purposes. The tagline is just Futura Bold."

  body: "Insignia doesn't seem nearly bold enough to match...\r\nI've kind of felt
    that it was a weird cross between [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/CustomFonts/Fonts/VFSans/|VF
    Sans]] and the R and S of Gotham. I am referring to the R in Focus Features, which
    I forgot to upload.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Focus-logos-300dpi_3814.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Book</a>. All it needs to match is to shorten the lower arm of the F.\r\n\r\n-

    - but this is by far the closest yet. \r\nThank you!"

  body: The S is much closer in Insignia and I can picture this being beefed up to
    match with the simple tweaks.
