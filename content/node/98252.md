body: "<em>Meleo</em> is the font I put out for critique almost a year ago. After
  endless tweaking and retouching, now it\u2019s finished, and can be found in MyFonts
  under the following link:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alexis-luengas/meleo/]]\r\n\r\nThe
  Regular weight is almost free, I hope I can also get some students to buy it ;^)
  Please let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.fileden.com/files/2012/2/9/3262384/Artwork2.png'
