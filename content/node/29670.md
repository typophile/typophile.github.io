  body: Unfortunately this is not on any of your hard drives because it is not a font,
    it is hand lettered. Note the differences in each 'R', 'G', etc.

  body: "Sorry guys.. What I meant to say was that I've seen this as a font.. Specifically
    the way the O is raised with the dot underneath it, and the way the F, R and E
    descend. Either that or I've replicated it by hand before and used it digitally.
    I keep to many typefaces in my head, and things start to blend together after
    awhile. Thanks though..\r\n\r\n..gd "
