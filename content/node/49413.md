body: "<strong>Sum up:</strong> On the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/47892\">Advice
  on establishing an Australian type club thread</a> I said \"the only interesting
  person in Helvetica is David Carson.\" That was overstating it. Carson isn't the
  only talking head worthy of your attention in Gary Hustwit's documentary on Max
  Meidinger's ubiquitous mid-century grotesk. Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere Jones
  give David Carson a decent run for his money. Hoefler in particular came across
  as we would expect such a type luminary to&#8212;articulate, lucid, quick-witted
  and well-informed. Frere Jones was more sober yet no less erudite or cultured than
  his partner. Matthew Carter was absorbing and informative.\r\n\r\nWhat disappointed
  me about this film was its near complete absence of teeth. It's just plain dull.
  A balanced view of Helvetica the font should present more than a handful of the
  type world's biggest and brightest stars. Hustwit made the mistake of focussing
  on mainstream opinion and mainstream use of Helvetica, and went on repeating this
  mistake for a mind-numbing eighty minutes of trite, safe, risk-free pandering to
  the lowest common denominator.\r\n\r\nWhere are all the other stars in the typosphere,
  such as Nick Shinn, Robert Slimbach, Sumner Stone, Gerald Giampa, Stuart Sandler,
  Tiffany Wardle, Rebecca Alaccari, Brian Bonislawsky, Richard Kegler, Peter Bruhn,
  Peter Bilak, Stephen Coles, James Grieshaber, Carl Crossgrove, Ray Larabie, Erik
  van Bokland, Hrant H. Papazian, Akira Kobayashi, Shu?\r\n\r\nWhere are the opinions
  of working graphic designers who hate the flipping thing? Why did Hustwit limit
  the expression of opinions on Helvetica to talking heads, and why limit samples
  of the font in action to signage and other real world use? It's a film for crying
  out loud. Cinema is a visual medium and Gary Hustwit simply did not make use of
  its many possibilities.\r\n\r\nMade-up samples of Helvetica made specially for the
  film could have been made to voice the views of less important type people. The
  titles are set in Helvetica, but designed and executed in an almost insufferably
  dull fashion. A boring font Helvetica may be (depending on your point of view),
  but artists are supposed to do interesting and surprizing things with boring fonts,
  aren't they?\r\n\r\nI'm hardly what you'd call a type geek, yet the film contains
  absolutely no factual information on the Helvetica font I did not know already.
  At the end of it I thought of a dozen ways it could have been made a superior, more
  interesting, stimulating and informative viewing experience. Instead Hustwit delivered
  <em>Nothing New About Helvetica</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Spec notes:</strong> At 80
  minutes it's far too long. The music is blows Dimetrodons.\r\n<strong>Rivals:</strong>
  The Life of Al Gore, A World Without Zinc, Beyond 'The Golden Compass'.\r\n<strong>Also
  try:</strong> Standing outside a train station and greeting commuters like they
  are guests arriving at your birthday party.\r\n<strong>Rating:</strong> Two stars.\r\n<strong>My
  choice:</strong> No, sorry. I sort of want to like it but I can't."

    term used to describe anybody interviewed on a screen for any purpose. Wiktionary
    defines it as, \"(idiomatic) A pundit who discusses issues of the day, especially
    one on TV.\" http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/talking_head\r\n\r\nMy use of the rem
    is broader than that. At least as broad as it is long.\r\n\r\nThe problem with
    Helvetica is that it only gives a handful of designers and type designers a voice
    on film. That's disappointing. It isn't broad enuff.\r\n\r\n<em>I found the titles
    perfectly appropriate. Helvetica is important for its neutrality (or dullness
    for some) and ubiquity. To do something different just for the sake of being different
    ignores the soul of Helvetica.</em>\r\n\r\nYour view and interpretation of what
    Helvetica is and the uses it can be put to is a bit conservative in my estimation.
    I advocate doing something different with it (for the film's titles) not merely
    for the sake off being different, but to reduce the yawn factor. Helvetica's soul
    can survive any assault, mild or extreme.\r\n\r\n<em>I\u2019m interested. What
    sort of music says Helvetica to you? Hustwit\u2019s choices were personal, but
    carefully considered, and I think they fit the subject well.</em>\r\n\r\nThe music
    Hustwit chose was unimaginative and had a dulling effect. Fitting the subject
    is one thing, sending the audience to sleep is something else.\r\n\r\nThere is
    more to documentary filmmaking than appropriateness, if you follow the significance
    of that. For example, by doing something unexpected and pushing the interpretation
    at the edges a flimmaker can throw a new perspective on the subject. It all has
    to do with catching the audience off-guard and taking a fresh look at things.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "Helvetica is so generic a typeface it can be contrasted with almost anything
    in any setting. That's kind of the whole point of my review and my take on the
    film as well as the type itself.\r\n\r\nTypophiles seem to have a black & white
    view of the type itself. I have been saying for almost a year now that Helvetica
    in bold weights really isn't so bad. Certainly it's more robust and malleable
    in bold or heavy guise, altogether less ugly, more palatable, and a lot more chuckable
    in the the hands of graphic designers and typographers who use it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Alternative

    is anything but sleep-inducing. Bach is pretty exciting. Miles mesmerizes.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing is for sure, Helveeta the font is quite generic and goes with just about
    anything, yet Hustwit's film is remarkably one-dimensional. Surely he could have
    come up with a lot more in the way of opinions and context. Only the bigwigs in
    the type business and a few prominent graphic designers like Carson and Brody
    are included, along with a few isolated draftsmen connected with the original
    font's creation.\r\n\r\nNarrow, narrow, too narrow even for pretend consideration.\r\n\r\nj
