  body: Yes...it seems like it was created just for that, and is not part of a typeface...maybe
    something similar?

  body: I can remember a &#40;freebie?&#41; font kicking around ages ago which was
    based on the doors logo. <BR>I think it was called Densmore &#40;after the drummer,
    John Densmore&#41;. <BR>I couldn&#39;t vouch for the quality, but it might be
    worth looking out for

    <BR>I&#39;ve found it on an old PC! <BR>There&#39;s nothing on the License, Links
    or Description tabs of the properties sheet, but on the name tab under &#39;Font
    vendor&#39; it says &#39;Macromedia&#39;, and under &#39;Copyright&#39; it says
    &#39;by Ray Larabie - freeware <a href="mailto:rlarabie@hotmail.com">rlarabie@hotmail.com</a>&#39;.
    <BR>Most of the other tabs are empty, except for the embedding tab which specifies
    that no embedding is allowed &#40;If you need embedability, maybe there&#39;s
    a version available for a small fee?&#41; <BR>Its always possible, I guess, that
    this font has been removed from Larabie&#39;s website under pressure from the
    owner of the original doors album covers etc? <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Wow, here''s an old thread. The Densmore font was removed because it was
    so poorly made. About 80 other fonts were culled from the Larabie Fonts collection
    in 2004 as well. It''s been remade and is now available for sale here: http://www.typodermic.com/207.html'
