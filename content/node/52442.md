  body: "Oh my ... given the nature of the crowd here, phrostbyte, I offer you my
    pre-emptive sympathy and implore you not to allow subsequent posts - if there
    are any - to bring you down or discourage you. I'm only hoping one of this site's
    real champions manages to find his or her way over to this thread and can provide
    you with their valuable insight.\r\n\r\nMy less-valuable insight: I've always
    been rather impressed with specimens that manage to visually match the theme of
    the font itself without going hideously overboard. For example, if your typeface
    is a circus-themed display face, you could perhaps as a background use a collage
    of circus visuals (pictures, paint, etc.) with an especially dominant center (clown,
    perhaps?), sepia-tone it, set it at maybe 15-percent transparency and then display
    your font. \r\n\r\nIf you prefer something even more conservative, consider using
    a cut-out ferris wheel as a cover with the font's name inside it and all-white
    background, and just put in the bottom right corner of the following pages a stand-alone
    clown or other circus icon, perhaps with a slight bevel or shadow. You have your
    own artistic sense, so you can do it. I just feel matching the font's theme works
    well. I've seen several gorgeous specimens for book/text-engineered fonts that
    incorporate pictures of opened books shot at various extreme angles and set on
    an all black background with the type displayed in white.\r\n\r\nAs for basics,
    you will likely hear several different opinions. Already I can hear one you'd
    almost certainly have received if I didn't just mention it here: it depends on
    for whom it's being created. Yeah, thanks buddy - 'preciate the educated response.
    My opinion is a bit more streamlined: create 2-4 specimens of varying size but
    make sure they all match (in color, use of graphics, art, etc.) Make a single
    page with just the type's name and perhaps a sentence or two describing who you
    are, and why it was created. Then make one a few pages larger and include a basic
    character set. After that go even larger and include full-page presentations ...
    meaning, cover, character set,  pretty third page with your font in action but
    not splattered all over the page, and a purely artistic final page. Then at the
    end make a big mondo-sized specimen and blow that sucker up. I've seen some specimens
    with a single letter per page! I think if you keep the theme the same, making
    multiple specimens would be easier and would certainly keep you prepared for anything
    you might encounter or need. It may be you never use two of the four. Or maybe
    you send the big daddy only to prospective vendors, etc., and use No. 2 on a sale
    page.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest, there are tons of links out there to specimens,
    which you can find rather easily if you have advanced knowledge of Google.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck."

    It contains a 12-pages essay about the concept and development of the typeface
    set on spreads (double pages), so if you print it you can have a real example
    of text setting.\r\nI also like the specimens made by students at the <a href=\"http://www.typefacedesign.org/2008/\">Reading

    for what I think makes a good specimen?  One that shows off the typeface in an
    environment that makes the typeface look the best it can.  Here's a simple checklist
    of the basics:\r\n<em>\r\n- does it show off all of the characters in the set\r\n\r\n-
    does it show the typeface properly set\r\n\r\n- does is include imagery that matches
    the typeface (if any imagery at all)\r\n\r\n- does it use a variety of contrasts
    to show off the typeface (colour, size etc etc)\r\n\r\n- does it include the typeface
    set in a realistic way somewhere so they can see what it will honestly look like
    when they go to use it for some mundane setting\r\n\r\n- does it make you want
    to buy the typeface all over again\r\n</em>\r\nI hope this helps, and for the
    record we're a bright cheery helpful community here, enjoy your stay!"

  body: "Actually, seeing Jelmar (Quincunx) posting here has reminded me that <a href='http://www.typehigh.nl/'>his
    own type specimens</a> were recently pointed out in one of the battle threads
    as being particularly good. In particular, check out the <em>sixtypound</em> specimen
    under <em>type design</em>.\r\n\r\nI don't have a huge mental repository of type
    specimens like many Typophiles seem to, so I can't really point to any specifics
    other than the one above. That said, as a designer, I find that the typefaces
    I purchase on impulse are ones which have a really strongly designed specimen
    like this. As Tom said, I think it really helps to see instantly how somebody
    has actually used the face. To a designer at least, typography is only partly
    about actual letterforms - the context they're used is obviously of immense importance.\r\n\r\nHope

  body: "I second the comment made by genericboy regarding Quincunx's specimens. Effective
    and clean yet still acutely artistic. Not to mention another important aspect
    of his specimens: they're well-protected from extraction. I love to see that and
    wish it would be some kind of unspoken ordinance for designers ... a dream that
    seems to continue falling on the deaf ears of those unaware of how prevalent pdf
    extraction is in the piracy community. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to prevent
    such extraction, FIND OUT before ever beginning your first specimen. Every time
    I open a .pdf I go to the properties menu and check which fonts are used in the
    file ... a reflex I developed after seeing a specimen of a font someone called
    something like \"Tamara\" in the speciment text but according to the properties
    listing had called \"superbitch\" when saving it. Even though having milk come
    out of your nose is unpleasant, seeing something so funny has resulted in my catching
    all kinds of interesting things regarding names, etc. Regardless, it only takes
    an extra 17 seconds to employ this kind of protection and I've yet to hear a reasonable
    argument against it. Even if piracy did not thrive on pdf extraction, why not
    just take the extra measure anyway?"

  body: "Whether print, PDF-printable, or online interactive, I prefer type specimens
    that refer to the genre of type specimens, rather than being faux versions of
    other kinds of document.\r\n\r\nFor print specimens, it's important to show what
    the typeface looks like at specific sizes, as this is the most help for typographers
    in imagining how it will look in use. Sure, these days we have wysiwyg, but all
    the more reason to have a printed specimen to elucidate the distinction between
    a laser-print made in one's studio, and \"real\" typesetting as printed by offset
    lithography.\r\n\r\nThe new MyFonts \"type tester\" interface is awesome, but
    there are other ways that testers can show type uniquely--I especially like how
    Darden and Dalton Maag foundries allow comparison of types of the user's choice,
    side by side. For my site/type tester, I tried to get the feel of a large page
    with lots of white space, not boxing in the type. \r\n\r\n"

    the fonts to curves, which is not really the ideal solution for type. It does
    indeed prevent people from ripping the PDF, but it also removes all the hinting
    and such. But I decided to do it anyway (since the specimen in question contain
    mostly large text sizes).\r\n\r\nBut there are also ways to secure a PDF, in a
    way that prevent you from placing the PDF in InDesign, opening it in Photoshop
    or ripping it through Distiller. Though, I don't know if it prevents extracting
    fonts too, since I have no idea how that is done."

  body: "Since all I ever deal with (well, 95%) is text types for books, I'd like
    to see type specimens that look like books. That is:\r\n**  full paragraphs,\r\n**
    \ 24-26 pica line length,\r\n**  a combo of justified and ragged,\r\n**  all the
    figures,\r\n**  all the small caps and other specials (but I don't need to see
    all the accented sorts),\r\n**  all the weights (of course, I'll use only text
    weight, a semibold, and a display weight),\r\n**  and, as Nick mentioned, a variety
    of size and leading,\r\n**  smalls and italic set within the roman to see how
    compatible their weights are.\r\n\r\nGo to a library with a good printing section,
    and see if you can see the 3-volume specimen set from Kingsport Press circa 1960.
    Monotype Baskerville is a good example of how they show a book face. There is
    a single page that shows the roman and italic sorts at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and
    12 point. These pages also show the character-per-pica count and the roman alphabet
    length. Following each of the full-alphabet pages we see the face set at  6 solid,
    6/7, 6/8; 7 solid, 7/8, 7/9; 8 solid, 8/9, 8/10; 9 solid, 9/10, 9/11; 10 solid,
    10/11, 10/12, 10/13; 11 solid, 11/12, 11/13, 11/14; 12 solid, 12/13, 12/14, 12/15.
    At a line measure of 22 picas justified. The paras show italic, smalls, and all
    caps.\r\n\r\nSpecimens such as these were an immense help to designers. Since
    type was not at all mutable, such data as the cpp count and roman alpha length
    were set. Therefore, with all this info, a good designer could cast off a book
    to a very accurate degree. \r\n\r\nI realize this is an unattainable goal these
    days; economics are against it. But something approaching this is a help.\r\n\r\nSo
    is an offset-printed specimen. I purchased an expensive font family from a small
    foundry a while back. I based my purchase on what I saw on screen, and on laser
    proofs I had to badger the foundry to send. I found I did not like the look of
    the face quite so much when I printed a book with it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the possibility
    of seeing acceptable specimens of book faces is why I have slowed down adding
    types to the library of late. I hate to do it, but I want to know pretty well
    what I'm getting.\r\n\r\npowers"
