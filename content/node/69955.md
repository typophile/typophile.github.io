  they are now, just png files. Somewhere it was typed that they are \"Annie,\" but
  in trying to find a place to buy them, I don't find an \"Annie\" that looks like
  these. They have Alt and beginnings. To me they look a little like GeeohHMK, but
  don't match in some letters exactly. Can anyone please help? Thank you.\r\np.s.
  Here are the images now. I have more if needed. Thanks."
