body: "I have an old Sanyo portable cassette player, and the labels on it are in an
  extended typeface that was relatively common for electronics back when transistor
  amplification (solid-state) was a whole new thing. I'd ideally like to find a set
  of it in movable type, but the name of the face would be a good start. I'm sure
  it has plenty of clones, so if anyone knows of one, it'd do for now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temp_3773.gif]"

  body: "It's definitely Microgramma, I'm going to buy some 10-16pt lead type whenever
    I find some.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll buy the font. Computer fonts always neglect
    the way font size affects line weight, and this one is no exception.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help, Typophile community."
