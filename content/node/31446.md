body: "hello all,\r\nWorking by myself I find I'm lacking in the \"bouncing of ideas\"
  off a workmate, so I would appreciate any advice. \r\n\r\nI am redesigning my local
  County Councils Child Care newsletter aimed both at parents and child care professionals.\r\n\r\nI
  have managed to convince the committiee that Futura would be a good display font
  for use in the headlines ect, but I am at a quandry as to what to use for the body
  copy. Setting it all in Futura doesn't sit well, Univers is easy to ready, and Frutiger
  looks good as well. Their prefered font is Arial. I have convinced them that Helvetica
  is better so thier prefered font is Heltvetica now.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is
  suggestions for fttns that have a bent towards art neuveu, due to the councils location
  in the UK, and are legible at 11-13 point. I will be printed on Arjowiggins Iniut
  paper at 130 gsm\r\n\r\nAny sugestions gratefull recieved\r\nCheers \r\nMartin\r\nPS
  I have a budget of up to \xA3100 for the font family I need at least a italic, bold
  and reg version."

  body: "Finding a companion to Futura just recently came up on Typophile <a href=http://typophile.com/node/31131>here</a>.
    The person was looking for a companion for a Futura logo to be used for short
    passages of text. The consensus as to what to use for text appeared to be Futura
    (again), Bodoni (what [[Robert Bringhurst]] suggests because of the two typefaces
    similar mechanical feel), a humanist sans like Syntax or Gill, or a slab serif
    like Beton, Memphis, or Lubalin Graph. You should note that the person looking
    for help was adamant about using another sans serif; most would suggest using
    a serif for extended body text.\r\n\r\nIn the thread, it came up that Futura came
    out of the Bauhaus and Art Deco movements, so I question your interest in using
    an Art Nouveau typeface, especially since Art Nouveau, to my knowledge, is most
    associated with France, not the UK.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions: <a href=http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html>Avenir
    Next</a>, <a href=http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18>Neutraface</a>,
    and <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay>Relay</a> could be good choices
    for sans-serifs that evoke both the geometric and Art Deco flavors of Futura.
    I'd, however, recommend a serif for body text, although other than Bodoni, no
    other one comes immediately to mind. The other thread I mentioned largely came
    to the conclusion that using sans-serifs for extended texts is not a great idea,
    so I'd really look into serifs.\r\n\r\nI'm not so up on my Art Nouveau typefaces,
    so I can't make any suggestions there."

    body: "Hello Cheers for your reply, the reason fo rthe interest in using the art
      neaveau is that the particluar area that the newsletter is being used in is
      historitcally associated with this movement, hence the reason for trying to
      find a suitable a art nouveau influenced font. Its not critical it was just
      a request by the client. \r\nUnfortunalty I have benn told that I must use a
      sans serif type to comply with the legibility guidlines the organisations has.\r\n"

  body: Well, I disagree with your organization's legibility guidelines -- I think
    that using a sans here would hinder it if anything. The only Art Nouveau, readable
    sans-serif I could find is <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-benguiat-gothic/>Benguiat
    Gothic</a>. It's by far the most readable Art Nouveau sans I could find, but I
    still wouldn't consider it a terrific choice for body text -- the letterforms
    are ornate enough to distract your readers. If you're committed to Art Nouveau,
    use this, but if you're not, look for a humanist sans-serif. May I recommend the
    newly released <a href=http://beorcana.com/specs3.html>Beorcana</a> by Carl Crossgrove,
    a fellow Typophile? It's specifically designed to be extremely legible, although
    I'm not positive if I would want to combine it with Futura. Might the Display
    sizes of it work for headlines too?

  body: "Hello Auricfuzz, \r\nthanks for the suggestions I'll look into them Beorcana
    looks iinteresting.. \r\nOne point, as I stated <strong>we have been</strong>
    told that we must use a sans serif. \r\nOne of the disadvantage we have found
    form working with local authorities is that those people who are in charge of
    commissioning do not always have a clue and often don't even want to hear your
    suggestions. It can be very frustrating as I too would have preferred to use a
    serif for this particular brief."
