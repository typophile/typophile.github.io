body: As further evidence of the growing public consiciousness of type design -- following
  close on the heels of Matthew Carter&#39;s recent radio interview in the USA --
  this month&#39;s <i>Vanity Fair</i> has a photo feature on &#39;Modern Masters&#39;
  that includes Hermann Zapf, looking very distinguished in his study, surrounded
  by <i>objet de type</i>.

  body: 'It&#39;s nice for typography to get recognition in the mass media occasionally,
    but a couple of items doesn&#39;t constitute a trend. <BR> <BR>Remember when Hoefler
    and Deck were in Wired? <BR> <BR>Another snippet: in eye 50 &#40;the latest, winter
    2003, &#34;typography&#34; issue&#41;, a short story about an Australian newspaper
    that ran a feature on Stephen Banham&#39;s &#34;Death to Helvetica&#34; campaign.
    <BR> <BR>Anyone in an obscure line of work &#40;Notwithstanding Crime Scene Investigators&#41;
    can relate to the puppeteer in &#34;Being John Malkovich&#34;. '

  body: Nick, Wired and Eye are both niche market magazines. National Public Radio
    and Vanity Fair have a very much broader audience, which is something fairly new
    in terms of public consciousness of type design.

  body: Wired had a mighty big niche before the bust, 400,000 in 1998 when it was
    bought by Conde Nast. Vanity Fair has a circulation of 1.1 million. &#40;Thanks,
    Jeeves.&#41; <BR> <BR>Yes, eye is a small circulation journal, but the newspaper
    that carried the story about Banham was a mass-circulation, daily mainstream paper,
    The Age, in Melbourne, Australia.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure there are occasional
    stories in various countries&#39; national media about type design, but they will
    always be isolated incidents. <BR> <BR>I was on the front page of the Montreal
    Gazette and in several other papers across Canada in 2001 when I designed the
    Richler typeface, and was even interviewed on TV &#40;wearing a tuxedo, actually,
    Eric, on my way to join the glitterati at the Giller Awards&#41;. That was my
    15 minutes! <BR> <BR>

    you refering to the fact that the puppets were based on WA Dwiggins marionettes?
    &#40; a very round-about way for typography to get mass media attention&#41;

  body: Not really &#40;I didn&#39;t know that&#41;. <BR> <BR>In the movie, the puppeteer&#39;s
    fantasy comes true, and puppeteering becomes recognized as a major art form. Actors
    give up mere acting, to learn the craft from the maestro, and become puppeteers
    themselves. The annual puppeteering &#34;Oscars&#34; become a huge media event.  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;And the award for best typeface goes to...&#34; &#40;billions around
    the world are glued to their TVs&#41;
