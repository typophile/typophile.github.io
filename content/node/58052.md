body: "Found the following at Garrick Van Buren's \"Kernest\" and figured Garrick
  might have better luck with an answer here at Typophile:\r\n\r\n<cite>Many of the
  assets browsers understand have specific MIME types to provide hints to the web
  browser (and email clients) on how to process them. Everything from images to javascripts
  to Microsoft Word docs have a corresponding MIME type.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>A basic
  example of this: PDFs might be rendered via a browser plugin or the browser might
  hand it over to Preview.app.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>With the adoption of @font-face
  and the corresponding proliferation of embedded fonts - is a font-specific MIME
  type needed?</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite><a href=\"http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/08/font-mime-types\">Anne
  van Kesteren asked this question back in 2008</a> - and the closest answer I can
  find is \u2018application/octet-stream\u2018 might be fine (since it already exists)
  but it definitely doesn\u2019t feel clean.</cite>\r\n\r\nFrom: http://kernest.com/blog/archive/font-face-and-font-mime-types"
