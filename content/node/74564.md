body: "We are developers of an online game and as we develop more using dynamic text
  we are finding that we need to fix font issues on a font by font basis in order
  for them to publish correctly within that environment. The main issues that we are
  running across are with special characters in the Latin character set, primarily
  accented characters. Sometimes these characters will drop out altogether or will
  push the following character out by two spaces or so when published. This doesn't
  happen when the fonts are used statically, only dynamically.\r\n\r\nWe don't have
  the sufficient technical experience here and are interested in hiring this expertise
  for this project. If you are interested in consulting on this issue, please either
  respond to this thread or contact me through my user profile on Typophile. Below
  are the main issues that we are hoping to resolve with your help.\r\n\r\n- Needs
  to support a full Latin character set\r\n- Needs to be able to publish dynamically
  without kerning issues or missing characters\r\n- Needs to support Mac and PC\r\n-
  Needs to work across all Adobe products (especially Flash)\r\n"

    creating a new font that renders well and correctly within your game platforms?
    Or are you looking for a Flash programmer who can address your text rendering
    problems with whatever fonts you are using?\r\n\r\nAlso, the term \u201Cfull Latin
    character set\u201D is not especially meaningful. You should probably research
    <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html\">Adobe\u2019s
    extended Latin character sets</a> and figure out which one supports your audience."

  body: Since you mention that you need to correct fonts on a "font-by-font basis"
    I would suggest you contact the designers and/or distributors of such fonts. If
    you have licensed them correctly you should be able to get the support you need
    to resolve the issues you describe.

  body: "We are not interested in making a new font for our product, we have already
    purchased a number of fonts from organizations such as Veer and House Industries.
    We also have a number of Flash programmers that we work with, however, we have
    done a bunch of research ourselves and our programmers have not been able to resolve
    this issue.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the character set, Adobe Latin 1 appears to cover
    all the regions we need to.\r\n\r\nThanks for your response,\r\nCory"

    Flash bugs or that maybe you\u2019re encountering undocumented bugs? Adobe has
    done a lot with dynamic text layout in recent versions of Flash so it\u2019s possible
    that these problems are just buggy code."
