body: For the cases where you have light and dark extremes on a weight axis, how do
  you guys decide where to &#34;place&#34; the eventual weights of the font? I&#39;m
  wondering not just about the -somewhat subjective, or at least vague- issue of what&#39;s
  a good &#34;Regular&#34; weight, but also what relationships the different weights
  in a family should have, especially when there are more than two weights released.
  <BR> <BR>This question isn&#39;t new in my mind, but it was rekindled by looking
  at Terminal Design&#39;s Giacomo&#42; - so I very much hope James will participate.

  body: '&#62; A Medium should be a good substitute for Regular <BR> <BR>That correlates
    well with my impression that Giacomo&#39;s Medium could be used to make fake smallcaps
    with the Regular, but the other steps are a bit large for that. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the elaboration! It seems to make a lot of sense. <BR> <BR>Any other insights
    from others? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Yeah, I like Luk[as]&#39;s analytical angle. <BR> <BR>But come on, guys, doesn&#39;t
    anybody else have insights about how to choose weights? <BR>What, you rely on
    dice or something? <BR> <BR>Like Joe, TF-Arrow has 10 weights, right? So please
    spill the beans, man!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
