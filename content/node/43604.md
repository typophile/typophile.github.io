body: "This is a typeface I have been working on for a couple of years, and I have
  not been able to get to a point where I feel it is finished. I think it is the puncuation
  and non-letter characters that I do not like. It is mostly a display face but I
  do envision it being used for small blocks of text. I would appreciate any comments.\r\n\r\nI
  am also looking for any ideas on what to name the typeface.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typefetish.com/itw/quirkblklttr.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMichael"

  body: that is an amazing looking font. Bard, Jester, and Armada are all ones that
    have been taken but might fit that.

  body: "I have to agree. There is something nice about this. It sits nicely somewhere
    in between handlettered and rigid typeface. I don't think I'd suggest regularizing
    at all. \r\n\r\nDo you think you will try to create more weights or widths?"

  body: I have already started a version of alternative characters with some flourishes
    and a large set of ligatures, but I don't want to get to far into the designing
    of them until I get the base finished. I have also thought about some kind of
    Initial Caps but haven't done any work on them.
