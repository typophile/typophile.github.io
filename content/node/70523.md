  I can find any number of articles about generic typography subjects such as terminology,
  basics about serifs v sans serifs and the like, and then again I can find lots of
  detailed tutorials about using software like InDesign, but I can't find any good
  resources about the combination of typography as applied in document design.\r\n\r\nPut
  another way, I'd be very interested in seeing some examples, guidelines, rules of
  thumb etc. specifically relating to the design of business documents that are readable
  and functional but a step away from the dreaded Micro$oft Word template sort of
  documents.\r\n\r\nBetween the basics on typography and the complexity of a magazine
  layout there has to be something about excellent design of documents such as letters,
  reports (annual reports as well as topic focused reports), questionnaires and manuals
  (policy documents, procedures, etc.). Any ideas out there people?\r\n\r\nIf not,
  then is anyone interested in making this thread something of a reference of the
  good, bad and indifferent in designing superior business documents?\r\n\r\nLove
  the forum and look forward to hearing some comments back!"

    this general topic, although they won't be focused solely on typography.\r\n\r\nNormally
    companies will hire graphic design consultants to create a graphic standards manual
    for their company, and it will include typographic standards, templates, etc.

    guidelines by Charles Hedrick is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for,
    there's some great information in that paper! I'll check out the other links on
    the Rutgers web site later but this is enough to get me started.\r\n\r\nHave a
    great day!"
