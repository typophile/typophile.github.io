  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">so here i am back with some more LP-Cover-font guessing…

this one is from Klemperer's Messiah recording SAN 146-48.
i had thought it would be an easy guess for whatthefont - alas i was wrong!

the font itself is neat though it looks rather odd on the cover (not to the least because the SANs, white background with the artwork in the bull-eye, usually show a single [Bodoni] font only)
http://www.classicalvinyl.com/san-146-48-messiah-handel.html

also bare with me if u think the classification is wrong


looking 4ward to YOUR input

kind regards

		<div class="commentbody">I can comment on classification. This style is usually called uncial, but the lettering is unusual in that it has with a Roman capital _A_ instead of a lower case or unicase _a_.
I don't recall a digital match.
BTW the bottom terminal on _S_ is very similar to the one used in Arrus BT https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/arrus/ which is based on lettering by Richard Lipton, who produced various hand-lettered calligraphic alphabets.
UPDATE:
Other possible classifications; Irish, Celtic,  Book of Kells, Medieval, calligraphic.
Possible source: English photolettering supplier?

The following typefaces are all uncials with a Roman capital A, but none have the restrained charm of your sample:

just a few thoughts: the cover is from the mid-sixties. (rec. '64)
the high-time of (revival) uncials had long passed by then and i bet against a unique hand-lettering in an era when this stile was at best thought of as "highly eccentric".
moreover - i got the distinct feeling that there has to be a full set of letters etc. out there because the whole impression is not as monolithic as it would had the design  been created for "MESSIAH" alone.
the bottom terminal on the 's' to me looks very art-nouveau. and so does its top companion!
regarding the 'a': the erbar mediaeval has a similar alternate cap 'a' - its legs however do not meet in a top-junction. still i think a dutch or english origin likelier.</div>

So perhaps something from an English or New York photolettering supplier?

above mentioned SANs have 1st series gold labels which clearly state "made in GB"
they are just emi's hmv "angel series" not angel records!
the angel records edition a.f.a.i.k. is cl 3657

emi is a tough cookie when it comes to labelography ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for discography clarification.
So English photolettering is most probable.
A lost of their work for corporate clients was custom and not in catalogs.
As for possible leads, one approach would be to find out who designed LP covers for EMI/Angel in the mid 1960s and  -- if they are still alive -- ask them about the source of the lettering.
BTW have you seen any more letters like this on EMI/Angel LP covers?

		<div class="commentbody">the angel records edition uses a different stile.
however on the front of the enclosed booklet the above font is being used. a.r. just reprinted the hmv booklet with an added a.r. logo.

i am not an expert by far but i haven't seen this specific font on any other hmv or angel cover.
there are some fonts -usual suspects aside - that at times seem to have been popular at design headquarters: e.g. weiss initials (et alternates), basilea etc. etc.

i finally decided to tweak the pic from top a little and use it for my purpose anyways.
still interested in the origin of the font though and also if there is a digitized version.

cheers!</div>
