body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have been reading the forums for quite a long time, and
  now I need some advice.\r\n\r\nI am working on a document of intermediate size (more
  or less a hundred pages, think of it as a \"mini thesis\"). I am using XeLaTeX to
  typeset it, and I was wondering if any of you can help me with the font choice.\r\n\r\nFor
  the moment, I opted on Garamond Premier for the text (I really like serif fonts),
  and Myriad for the headers \u2013 see the example PDF file (in french\u2026). I
  tried a couple fonts for the text (I had a hard time deciding wether I should use
  Arno, Granjon, Minion or Garamond), but I think this combination is OK in term of
  readability. For the headers, I tried Frutiger (I like it, but I'm not sure it is
  \"strong\" enough to get the reader to focus) and Cronos.\r\n\r\nDoes any of you
  can offer some advice about what other fonts can fit?\r\n\r\nBest"

    go very well with Minion/Myriad and with Novel/Myriad. Leading and margins are
    also very good.\r\n\r\nBetween the serifs, I think the decision would be made
    according to OpenType features you may need (Minion does not have small caps numbers,
    for example).\r\n\r\nAbout headers, I think it's better to use also Myriad, in
    a bolder style. To mix Myriad and Frutiger, two very near sans, is not recommended.
    It's also possible to adopt a third font in a clearly different style. Anyway,
    I'd preffer to use just two fonts in a nice, clear design as yours."
