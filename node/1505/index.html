  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>I am new to this board.. well posting wise.. (my first post!) but i've been reading it alot over the past few months. <BR> <BR>anyways, <BR> <BR> <BR>oh yes.. i posted this in the design forum because it seems that you cant make threads in the critique forum for some reason? <BR> <BR>currently im taking typography 1 at my college. its alot of fun, our current project is to design a 27th letter of the alphabet using a provided face. of all faces I was given times new roman! haha! anyways, I wanted to see what people thought about this, or any suggestions. I am still learning about type, and i figured this place could help me out. we have to render these in ink at 2.5 x height, 5 times, replacing the created character with a letter in a 5 letter word.  <BR> <BR>my current concerns pertain to the descender on my letter. should it be the same distance down as the 'j' ? or should it be smaller? personal preference? i was looking at the face, and i guess i could argue that it was meant to be a unique form in the alphabet like the loop on the 'g' my professor brought this up in critique tonight. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17778.gif" alt="kerned example"> <BR> <BR>thanks for any feedback!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fascinating project! Your teacher is good. <BR>And Times is a great candidate: it's &quot;constructed&quot; but has good readability, plus it has all those funky IPA characters designed for it which you might look at. <BR> <BR>I see some problems with you proposed new character, but I think you need to back up and look deeper at the problem before going too far towards a solution. <BR> <BR>I would start with the &quot;Intro to Typeface Design 110&quot; under Courses on Typophile itself. It's a great &quot;formal&quot; aesthetic approach in understanding not just shapes, but their underlying structures. <BR> <BR>But there's a world of richness beyond that exercise. There's the issue of spacing, where your new character is problematic (it may hit a subsequent left-hand descender*). There's the issue of what the/an alphabet <i>needs</i>: does it need a character that fits in more (like the &quot;n&quot;) or that diverges more (like the binocular &quot;g&quot;)? And does it need an x-height, ascending, or descending (or both!) character? <BR> <BR>* It might help to decide if the new letter is a consonant or a vowel, or if it's just phonemically superflous (like the &quot;c&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are already). <BR> <BR>I would love to make concrete recommendations, but since this is about the process of learning, it's better if you try to answer questions like the above - the answers will draw out the solution from within you. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Randy, since email delivery is down (not just for me, I assume?) I was working my way down manually, and I saw Drew's thread here first, <i>then</i> the other one with your post!  :-) <BR> <BR>Since I think the Design section is a better place for this than Typography/Composition, just to streamline things here's Randy's post from the other thread: <BR> <BR>&quot; <BR>Hi Drew,  <BR> <BR>Let me be honest. I think the length of your decender is the  <BR>least of your problems! Sorry&hellip;  <BR> <BR>As a start at curing your letter of it's maladies, let me point  <BR>you to Jonathan Hoefler's course at typeophile that looks at  <BR>the very assignment you've got: Type Design 110  <BR> <BR>Honestly, first check out what he's saying. What are the  <BR>characteristics of times roman? Given that, is the basic  <BR>stucture of the &quot;letter&quot; consistent with Times? How could it  <BR>be more Times-like in structure? Where is there evidence of  <BR>a pen? What angle is it held at? As a result, where are the  <BR>thick parts? Where are the thin parts? Where are the serifs?  <BR>Where does times roman break it's own rules?  <BR> <BR>Your glyph needs all these questions to be asked. Take a  <BR>look, and if you're still at a loss, I'll give you more specific,  <BR>practical pointers.  <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing the fruit of your studies!  <BR>&quot; <BR> <BR>BTW, I agree with what you said, except I would [predictably] caution against the &quot;pen&quot; approach. You'll note for example that Drew's glyph has one thick horizontal and one thin: depending on the &quot;structural context&quot; of the rest of the glyph, that might actually work best, irrespective of chirography. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks alot guys. <BR> <BR>I took a look at those tutorials. Honestly, I learned more looking at those than the 5 weeks into this semester of this class, however our first 2 projects involved just tracing letters at 5&quot; xheight in ink *pefectly* to appreciate differences in the forms. Then we did kerning. <BR> <BR>Attached are a few revisions. I started to think about how you would write it with a pen, and where the serifs should be. I am not sure how to determine whether it is balanced correctly? like, the counter space.. too big? small?  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17873.gif" alt="evolution1"></div>
