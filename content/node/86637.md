  release it myself? Or just release it into the public domain under their copyright?\r\n\r\nTell
  me more, thanks."

  body: "It depends on what country you live in. IIRC, in the States, you cannot copyright
    a design. If *you* digitize a font, say from a printed source, it is perfectly
    legal. You can then copyright your font data, but again, not the design. The font
    *name* may well have to be different. Some names are in the public domain (Janson,
    Baskerville, etc.) \r\n\r\nBelieve the situation on protecting a design is different
    in Europe. Don't ask about Asia.\r\n\r\nNotice I said *legal*. Opinions vary on
    the ethics."

  body: There already were several discussions on the topic (you could [Google] search
    the forum). Also, for a better chance to receive answers, you should move the
    thread to General Discussions (not Release).
