  body: "I think Ben's right about Spoleto. In my notes I have written that it's the
    same as Opti Sport Script. The Novel Fonts seem to have virtually disappeared,
    but I think the Opti fonts can still be purchased. If you could use a few words
    set in it, I have the Spoleto font, or I could make a sample of all the letters,
    if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think that \"OPTISport-Script\" is the proper font file name, and I believe
    it was part of one of the packages that Opti used to sell, perhaps before Castcraft
    took them over. For all I know it may still be included in font collections they
    offer. I know there are people who have these fonts, but the Castcraft folks have
    been generally hard to reach, and prices seem quite steep for unoriginal work.
    \r\n\r\nThe thread you linked mentions some fair alternatives too.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "For what it's worth, Spoleto and Opti Sport-Script are identical in shape
    but they are not identical digitizations. I have both fonts and just examined
    them in Fontographer. The Opti font has a 1991-2 copyright from Castcraft, and
    Spoleto has a 1994 NovelFonts copyright. I know this information is easily changed,
    so proves nothing. Just as an example I copied the outline of the W from one and
    overlayed it on the other font's W. The outline points were different in number,
    and the outlines were slightly off from each other, but so marginally that I would
    never have been able to tell without such a detailed look. \r\n\r\nIt is easy
    to presume that these could be two independent digitizations taken from the same
    source (perhaps a film type), however, it's possible that Spoleto was copied and
    slightly modified from Sport-Script, if you believe the Castcraft copyright date.
    It's probably all academic, since neither is easily obtained any more.\r\n\r\nIt
    comes to how much you need to use this exact typeface. If you say the letters
    on the package look better, then someone apparently realized the exisiting fonts
    are based on a flawed hand-drawn film type (the 's' looks too light for the other
    letters, for example) and modified it to fix some of the imperfections.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said all that, I just saw a new font called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/machiarge/\">Machiarge</a>
    from a small Japanese foundry called Flat-it. It seems quite similar in feeling,
    but much more nicely drawn.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
