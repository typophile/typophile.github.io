  designer of the XXh century, passed away.\r\nI suggest a minute to look at his (master)works
  in order to (re)think to vulgarity and sloppiness of (most) today's graphic design.\r\nCarlo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kirche-und-Kunst_4917.jpg]"

  body: "Alessandro, try to take a look at \"At first sight\" (Lars Muller Publishing),
    the last book with Mendell's works (or look at www.mendell-design.de).\r\nBy the
    way the poster was for an exibition on relationships between art and church. Powerful,
    astonishing graphic design.\r\nLess is (so) more...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I will, Carlo, thank you, I am sure that Mendell was aware that we don't live
    in a "less is more" society.
