body: I thought about this when I got a lipstick the other day. To me it's Chanel.
  The font, the two C:s, the black and white, not to mention the most beautiful perfume
  bottle in the world - No 5. (And yes, that's my favourite perfume as well).  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FWN05010LG_4631.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAFMU340LG_3986.jpg]

    think it is beautifully balanced, and perfectly suited to the product line it
    is advertising. Some guys feel about their power tools the way some ladies feel
    about jewelry and perfume, so maybe it's a kind of male counterpart to the Chanel
    elegance and sophistication :)\r\n"

      I picked Chanel because I'm a woman and you picked a power tool\r\nlogo?  ;-)
      It would be interesting to see if there are any elegant logos for tools, or
      wouldn't that sell? "

    I don't care if my chain saw is pink and has a swishy logo: I want one that works!"
