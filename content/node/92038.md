body: "Having become somewhat disillusioned with my book font project, I dug up an
  old attempt at fontmaking, \"Catharsis Requiem\", and started remaking it with the
  new knowledge on typography I had gathered in the meantime.  While the original
  was supposed to look serious and ceremonial, I moved from a humanist to a modern
  stroke to make a flashier and more glamourous font... <strong>Catharsis Glamour</strong>.
  \ \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glamor_4964.png]\r\n\r\nI intend to
  make a companion font, <strong>Catharsis Glory</strong>, with less contrast and
  possibly adnate serifs, for smaller text sizes and \"tougher\" environment. Also,
  it should be fairly easy to make different <strong>weights</strong> for these fonts,
  given their modular nature.  I will probably skip on the <strong>italic</strong>
  because the machine-created slanted version looks already quite usable to me.\r\n\r\nOf
  course, I won't start with any of that until I've polished the base font a bit more.
  \ What are your opinions and suggestions?\r\n\r\nAnd in case you were wondering,
  this is the old precursor font, <strong>Catharsis Requiem</strong>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/requiem_6311.png]\r\n\r\nOof!
  My eyes! It hurts!  ;o)"

  body: "One thing that might still be a problem is that I use two different strengths
    for the thin parts of the font. Serifs and the thin halves of arcs usually are
    10 units (blue) while crossbars are 15 units (red). The ansae of |o|-like letters
    (red) also end up rather heavy-looking, although the thickness there was supposed
    to be 10 by design...  hm.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I did this was that the crossbars
    felt too flimsy to me.  Should I just man up and make them thin and uniform, or
    is it viable to keep it like this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thin_3502.png]"

    of the shoulder. The right stem extends vertically up to almost the x-height,
    and the arch then drops down rather far on its way to the left stem.\r\n\r\nFor
    Glamour, I would prefer to keep more even-sided arches; domes rather than slanted
    roofs.  I realize this might make it harder to read, since it makes the tops of
    |n| and |o| look more similar than they need to be. On the other hand, that same
    similarity could also be seen as a consistent style. Is that a viable course of
    action?\r\n\r\nI took some other pointers from Didone, though: keeping the outer
    edge of the right stem vertical to a greater height than the inner edge, \"cheating\"
    by shaving a bit off the serifed stem, and just generally tweaking the curves
    until they seemed to flow into each other better.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nn_3887.png]\r\n\r\nWhat

    for four fonts for a medium-sized foundry of high repute. There's no way iKern
    could match the results. If you want to talk numbers: hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nBTW
    fonts like this might not need a lot of kerning, but the tight and high-contrast
    nature is actually rather demanding in terms of \"base spacing\". Look for example
    at the \"ump\" in your most-recent image. You can't just use a [simple] formula
    for the sidebearings.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
