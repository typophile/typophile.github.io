body: "I'm using ITC Kabel as a headline font and I'm looking for a font for the body
  copy that would complement it nicely. The body uses italic and roman and the type
  will be reversed on a dark background. So, it seems like a sans serif font would
  be more legible but, I don't want to use kabel for copy and I'm not sure about using
  two sans serif font's together. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about using two sans serif
  font on the same piece?\r\n\r\nIf I should stick with a serif font, what would be
  most legible reversed out?"

  body: Be careful using text type on a dark background. The legibility suffers.
