body: "Hello everyone,\r\nI've a question about horizontal and vertical stems in FontLab.\r\nGoing
  to Font Info --> Hinting Settings --> Standard stems (T1 hinting) it is possible
  to define values for horizontal and vertical font's standard stems.\r\nBut when
  I'm in a blank Glyph Window is there a way to visualize horizontal and vertical
  hints based on those values?\r\nI mean, how can I make those values useful for the
  designing process of the glyphs?\r\nThank you for your help!"

    Not directly, that I know of. However, you can see stem thicknesses of current
    stems, by autohinting them (F7). If you then use the option to convert hints to
    links, the links will dynamically adjust when you make changes to the outlines,
    to always show the current measurement."

  body: Guidelines can be used for the alignments and horizontal stems, and vertical
    stems are not as hintable anyway, but a grid helps to place and weight them consistently.
