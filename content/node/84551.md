  body: Looks like a somewhat mangled <a href="http://myfonts.us/td-nvzPPN">ITC Tiffany
    Heavy</a> with swash characters on the n, s, and r. I don't think the swash characters
    are available in any of the current digital versions.

  body: I can't get the s to look right. The n is slightly off as well. Is there another
    possibility? Or did someone tweak the font for this application?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni-s_3576.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni-n_6654.gif]

  body: "There are several problems: \r\n\r\nFirst, the Tiffany swash letters, which
    were available for film headline setting back in the '80s, have not been digitized.
    In fact, I'm pretty sure they were not even officially part of the ITC design,
    but were added by someone else. So, it's not likely that ITC (Monotype) will add
    them back in.\r\n\r\nSecond, the letters in the logo are not faithful renderings
    of the original typeface or the swash characters. Either they were not drawn well
    to begin with (a knock-off font, perhaps), or they were retraced or redrawn for
    the logo by someone who was not very skilled. It's close enough to tell what font
    it's based on, but not a perfect match. \r\n\r\nGiven these two problems, there
    is almost no way you could match the letter shapes with existing digital fonts.
    The Bodini Classic Swashes are roughly similar, but it's a completely different
    font, so it's not surprising that they don't match all that well.\r\n\r\nIf you
    need to recreate this, your best bet would be to trace it by hand (if you have
    the skill to do that), or auto trace a high-res scan of it."
