  from Flanders? Of course I will be interested in Libraries but if anybody has specific
  books to recommend that would be great. Also, for extra points anybody know who
  the happening scribes of the time were? Or what books are considered especially
  superior from that time? I have the impression that this period is what the famous
  UK authority on calligraphy, Johnston was keen on. '

    written, a bit in LetterLetter and The Stroke.

  body: "Hooray! Thanks for the extra info. \r\n\r\nThe reason I am asking for this
    is that Gerrit Noordzij says that if I want to write as well as observe contextual
    alteration of spacing & form in a scibal tradition this is probably the best time
    period to look at. So far my early observations seems to be positive.\r\n\r\nLater
    today I will post names that I have pulled from Noordzij's own writing."
