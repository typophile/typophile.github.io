  can answer. i am working in a big swiss advertising-agency at the moment, and the
  thing is they dont have any font-folders (like a folder with a4 prints of every
  fonts and there diffrent cuts). i have now brought my own fonts from home and am
  trying to find a program that can arange fonts&size&cuts and print them on a4 paper.
  the problem is that ive tryed typebook which does exactly that, only you have to
  activate the fonts, since i have around 40`000 font i cant activate them all...
  can anybody help me?\r\n\r\nbest regards&cheers\r\nbarney\r\n\r\nps: g5, 10.4, font

    also think about the legal implications of your fonts being used at the new agency,
    unless they never leave your Mac. Check your EULA for those individual 40,000
    wow you have been spending up large."
