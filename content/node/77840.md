    Sans, and many more, you'll see that Black can be much blacker than Sensato Black.

  body: "@Nick: Looking forward to your feedback!\r\n@Micha Mirk: The k looks fine
    to me. Your right about the o, though it's a really small difference. The i and
    j look better to me the way they are now. Perhaps I'm just being stubborn, but
    I've tried it and I prefer it he way it is. It's also distracting when reading
    and some strokes are cut off at a different angle. The ascenders and descenders
    are not really 'seen' when reading, so I decided to cut those off at an angle.
    Somehow it doesn't feel distracting to me what I did in the n, m, d, etc.\r\n@Nalie:
    IMO no. In most similar typefaces they are, but I simply think this looks better.\r\n@
    T\xE9 Rowan: I take that as a compliment =D\r\n@ Caled: Making the top of r wider
    will create a huge gap in words like 'sports', so I'll probably keep it this way.
    I don't see what's wrong with the y. I quite like it actually.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry
    if I come across stubborn, but I won't change things that look perfectly fine
    to me unless you can convince me otherwise. I have considered and tried out all
    of your suggestions carefully and changed very little. Anyhow, still many thanks
    for your feedback. Gives me something to think about for the comming few days.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper

    the k remind me of serif typefaces without the serifs. Have you tried a k where
    the diagonals meet in a T form like in most (old) serif fonts? If you have also

  body: "I think the /y/ does need some work. If you made the longer / stroke taper
    less (by letting it swing out rightward more at the baseline), you would fix what
    I see as weakness at the beginning of the tail. As a happy byproduct, the right
    contour of the letter would then be at a less steep angle, which should make spacing
    a bit easier.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the outer contour of /o/ is bit too \"dynamic\"
    for the rest of the face.\r\n\r\n/d/'s upper juncture seems a touch inorganic

    have to be negative to get an even colour. Is negative spacing OK?\r\n\r\nYou're
    also right about the o. it used to be even more 'dynamic', but I guess I didn't

    on the right track with the root of the name you've chosen, that is the meaning
    is appropriate. However, the sound isn't. The 'ato' ending is rough or staccato
    rather than smooth and sensual. You need a word that conveys the right impression

  body: "Hi Jasper\r\n\r\nMore time on my hands so I'll give feedback a shot today!
    It's long again - sorry about that.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I was told to do
    when designing bold weights was to put the same glyphs from both regular and bold
    (in your case black) next to each other when you are designing them. They will
    both inform each other about the way each should look (I'm guessing because the
    regular is roughly where you want it so it's the black that will have to yield
    to the width principles already established on the regular). You may even find
    that the regular needs tweaking.\r\n\r\nAre you making the widths consistent across
    weights? If you do, then the black will inevitably look narrower than the regular.
    The light/thin end may even begin to look a little extended! It's a nice thought
    to have a uniform width across weights but in practice (particularly in the extreme
    weights) they will look like they are different widths. It's amazing how much
    wider you'll need to go with the black to make it look the same width optically.\r\n\r\nIf
    you put both Regular and Black /o/s next to each other, I'm sure you'll see that
    the dynamism that Craig has already referred to is rather too much in the black
    weight (not just the /o/, although that's where it's perhaps most obvious). For
    me, it isn't more 'plain' that you want, it's more <em>consistent</em> across
    weights. Plain is fine. Workhorse typefaces can't afford to be too flamboyant.\r\n\r\nSo
    generally, to me at least, most characters look narrow in the black. However the
    /a/ and /e/ look about right to me, maybe even a touch wide, but they make particularly
    the /b/ (and similar glyphs) and the /n/ (and similar glyphs) look very narrow
    indeed.\r\n\r\nThe black looks much more tightly spaced than the regular (which
    I meant to say looks a touch loose, although it reads very well being that loose).\r\n\r\nThe
    /i/ and /j/ dots/tittles could afford to be more circular and therefore come closer
    to the tops of the stems (which I'm fine with being flat BTW). The dots look a
    little like they are floating away in the black. Also, the dots on the /i/ and
    /j/ need to influence the period much more (or vice versa).\r\n\r\nAs far as the
    tops of the /b/, /d/, /h/ etc being slanted is concerned, if they are flat tops
    in the regular, they should be flat in the black in the name of consistency. Slanted
    is fine (I prefer flat but it's your baby) but do make them slant in all or none
    of the weights.\r\n\r\nIf the black /k/ looks right (to me it's not bad), then
    the regular /k/ needs to be narrower. I sound like a broken record with that regular
    /k/!\r\n\r\nYou're right, if you make the top of the /r/ longer (CaleD), you'll
    get big white areas in black text (especially if this particular weight continues
    to be this tightly spaced). A lot of designers make their /r/ deliberately narrow
    to avoid this, you're in good company.\r\n\r\n>>>I don't see what's wrong with
    the y. I quite like it actually.\r\nMe too, but maybe try a bit of optical adjustment
    (see Craig's comment). May get even better!\r\n\r\nWhen you've done the caps I
    would make a multiple master (assuming that's the route you're going down to make
    your range of weights). This might help with the whole width thing.\r\n\r\n>>>Enough
    about the name.\r\nYou're not kidding. I've been trying to think of a name for
    my latest effort and it's been impossible! If you've found one you like, happy
    days! At this stage, the name is relatively unimportant and may change again.
    The only thing I would add is that, in an ideal world, you do want your name to
    begin to show off the best characters (or maybe that's not as important as I think
    it is?)\r\n\r\nBeautifully done, hats off once again. Please take my comments
    with a big pinch of salt. I'm no expert, esp. in the company of some of the guys
    who post here."

  body: "Thanks Lasko\r\n\r\n@Nick: Don't apologize for long feedback. The more the
    better, I'd say! I am trying, as you already guessed, to keep the widths consistent
    across weigths. To me, it doesn't look wrong, and it might be a good selling point.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right about the o. I already changed it and I'll include it in the next update.
    (Caps too, hopefully.) I have also changed the a and e already, which will also
    be included in next update.\r\n\r\nAt a second glance it's probably the regular
    that needs tighter spacing. \r\n\r\nI'll have another look at the tittles. I haven't
    changed the period yet, so it's too small indeed.\r\n\r\nThe tops of ascenders
    in the regular are already slanted, but not updated yet.\r\n\r\nThe regular k
    is also changed, but not updated yet.\r\n\r\nI have changed the y (looks better
    to me now) but not in the way craig suggested. Does the right diagonal of the
    y look more horizomtal (less steep) to you?\r\n\r\nI have already tried what the
    bold will look like and it didn't look too narrow to me. Perhaps some text tests
    for bold and regular will prove me wrong, but I'm confident it will work out fine.
    There are more good typefaces out there with consistent width across weights and
    some of them have been quite succesful.\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I would add is
    that, in an ideal world, you do want your name to begin to show off the best characters
    (or maybe that's not as important as I think it is?)\" I did pay attention to
    that, decided not to force it too much, as in a good typeface any combination
    should look good. IMO the s, a and t show off Sensato's style quite well, so also
    regarding the way it looks I'm pretty pleased.\r\n\r\nAs you might have read,
    there are quite a lot of things yet to be updated. This is mainly because I want
    to run some good text proofs and finsih the caps before the next update. I have
    found a good Xante aw1200 for just \u20AC25 in the city I live in, so I'll probably
    be able to make some test prints soon.\r\n\r\nCheers, Jasper\r\n"

    weigths. To me, it doesn't look wrong, and it might be a good selling point.\r\n\r\nDon't
    do it! The fact that I noticed same widths means that it was an obvious issue
    for me. I'd also get a lot of other opinions on this spacing matter. Honestly,
    I think less people will buy it because the bold/black looks too narrow. Consider
    all the fonts in the world by all your favourite designers... how many are same
    width throughout? It may be an noble and admirable aim but it'll almost certainly
    spoil what has the potential to be a very beautiful face. Why would you try the
    impossible on your second font? Same widths may not be noticeable in some glyphs
    but in some like /i/k/l/v/y/ it'll give you massive headaches.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    if you tighten the spacing on the regular, that will give the black even more
    of a spacing crunch, assuming you keep the spacing uniform! Believe me, you're
    already squashed in this black weight. It's getting on towards a narrow cut.\r\n\r\n>>>Does
    the right diagonal of the y look more horizomtal (less steep) to you?\r\nYes the
    junction and tail have to move to the right otherwise it looks like its leaning
    to the right (very mildly italic). It's only optical, so what I guess Craig was
    saying was thicken the tail at the junction by moving the outermost smooth point
    at the base of the right diagonal further right. I guess he'll have to confirm
    that.\r\n\r\nKeep going! \r\n\r\n"
