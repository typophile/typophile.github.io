  handles with my beziers, wherever possible. And I avoid unnecessary points... e.g.
  a perfect circle ought to be four points. \r\n\r\nWhen I open other people's fonts,
  particularly scripts, the curves look so perfect. Like someone took a circle or
  ellipse and then chopped it half (or wherever). Or maybe did the equivalent of drawing
  a stroke in illustrator and outlining it. \r\n\r\nWhen I try to draw curves on my
  own, I'm awkwardly stretching first this horizontal handle, then that vertical,
  then the horizontal... as the curve seems to bulge towards one side or the other.
  Just when I think I have it perfect, I zoom out, and it's not right, the curve's
  skewed. I look at this image and think \"how'd that get so clean and perfect, especially
  where the the bowl fattens.\r\n\r\nIs there some trick to this, a way of measuring
  the length of handles relative to each other? Or is it just eyeballed?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6181.jpg]"

    Spiro mode.\r\nsee: \r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/33531]]\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/38483]]\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/57651]]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou'll
    have to switch back to Bezier mode before final output to fine-tune some things,
    and probably before that because certain operations don't work as predictably
    in Spiro mode, but I think you'll be happier with the curves you produce once
    you get used to it."

    the shape, and then shift-click on the lines to pull the curves into place. This
    is much more efficient than drawing a bunch of curves and trying to figure out
    where the extreme points go.\r\n\u2022 Optimally each handle should extend about
    1/3 of the distance of the curve. But you have to break this rule a lot.\r\n\u2022
    Good curves look continuous and not like a series of smaller curves. You have
    to shift-drag nodes along a curves to get the sweet spot.\r\n\u2022 Learn to work
    by shift-clicking on curves and dragging them around instead of using the handles.
    Only touch handles to make minor adjustments."

  body: "Thanks for the responses so far. Dunwich's especially, it never even occurred
    to me to just draw the extrema points and go from there, but it makes sense as
    I think about it. And the shift-clicking on curves too, I'd been strictly working
    with the handles. I never really played with manipulating the curves directly
    because mostly I've drawn in illustrator. I'm not sure if illy even allows this.\r\n\r\nI
    will also check out Spiro and the remix tools. <em>edit: so I have to run cygwin
    emulator to run fontforge, then figure out how to add the plugin? Don't suppose
    there's an easier path for a lazy windows user?</em>\r\n\r\nNick - as for deleting
    the center point on the curve, when I open fonts I often see these points, and
    when you outline them in illustrator etc. you get dozens of extra unneeded points.
    But if I see a center point in, say, fontlab, does that mean the designer added
    them? Or just some quirk of how fontlab draws the glyph?\r\n\r\nJM: I used your
    graphic because it struck me how perfect the curves looked. Since it was the inspiration
    for the thread, I decided it would be suitable to show what I meant (to show what
    really nice perfect curves look like, as opposed to the crap I produce). I was
    in no way criticizing you or anything you've made. In my ignorance I thought the
    little blue points were the handles on the beziers, and it struck me how consistent
    they were. But apparently they're not. My apologies."

    for drawing fonts but, then again, I've been a CorelDraw user since version 1.\r\n\r\n<em>if

    it's the proper way to draw bezier curves for PostScript. Autotracing in ANY program
    tends to introduce a lot of superfluous points: it's best to draw the oultines
    on your own, from scratch..."

    but the software itself is in English. Just download, unzip, and run the program.

    It does a good job of minimizing the number of points and not creating overlapping
