  body: "A quote from [[http://typophile.com/node/52374|this]] discussion:\r\n\r\n\"The
    font is called \u2019Larish\u2019 and was indeed drawn specially for Secession
    identity which was developed together with Willi Schmid, in 2007-2008. Its appearence
    is inspired by an old prints from Vienna of late 19th century. Even it is not
    re-drawn typeface, its shape it true to the spirit to its example.\"\r\n\r\n(The
    actual font name appears to be Larisch Alte.)"
