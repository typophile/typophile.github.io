  body: In my Adobe apps, when I switch fonts- by default, the weight matches the
    previous face (if available). For example, I'm using Myriad Bold and then Switch
    to Times New Roman- the weight will be Times New Roman Bold. I would assume that
    the weight info is being used in this case.
