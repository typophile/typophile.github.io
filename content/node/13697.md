  Linotype GmbH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of [[Monotype Imaging Inc.]]. Linotype
  is the current member of a long line of Linotype corporations. Previous Linotype
  corporations had purchased or merged with many of their competitors, including [[D.
  Stempel AG]], [[Deberny and Peignot]], [[Haas]], and the [[Dr.-Ing Rudolf Hell GmbH]].\r\n\r\nThe
  first Linotype entity ([[Mergenthaler Linotype]]) was founded in New York in 1890
  by a German immigrant to the United States, [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]], who had invented
  the first commercially viable typsetting machine in 1886, the [[Linotype Machine]].\r\n\r\nLocated
  today in Bad Homburg, Germany, Linotype's website is <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype.com</a>.
  The digital foundry distributes over 6,000 fonts, including most of the typefaces
  designed by [[Adrian Frutiger]] and [[Hermann Zapf]]. Other popular typefaces include
  [[Helvetica]], [[Syntax]], [[Sabon]], [[Compatil]], and [[Vialog]].\r\n\r\nLinotype's
  Managing Director  is [[Frank Wildenberg]]; the Type Director is [[Akira Kobayashi]].\r\n\r\nFrom
  1997\u20132006, Linotype GmbH (1997\u20132005 under the name \"Linotype Library
  GmbH\") was a wholly-owned subsidiary of [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG]]."
