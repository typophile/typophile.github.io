  7? I used to use suitcase 11. Meanwhile suitcase fusion 3 is out, but on the extensis
  forum I also read of problems with windows 7. Deactivating doesn't always work,
  messes up the build in Windows Font Manager, temporary fonts are still placed as
  (ghost) fonts in the windows/fonts folder etc.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, besides Suitcase,
  which font managers can be considered as standard or a good alternative?"

  body: Any more? Perhaps fully compatible with windows 7 and even cs5 auto activation
    plugins? And does not touch the windows/fonts folder in any way nor mess up windows
    7's build in 'Windows Font Manager'?
