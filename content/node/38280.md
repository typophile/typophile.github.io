  body: "One standard I've seen advocated is the width of the 'i' in the font. The
    [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/spaces.aspx|Microsoft
    Charater standards]] give 1/4 em as a standard, with more or less (as little as
    1/5 to as much as 1/3 em) depending whether the characters in the font are wide
    or narrow. \r\n\r\nMy own conclusion is that a reasonable approach is to start
    with the word space as either the advance width of the lower case i or 1/4 em,
    and then proof your font with somewhat greater and smaller values and to see what
    you think works best. You can vary the word space in InDesign or Quark, so it
    is not that troublesome to proof.  "

    point. The em doesn't know anything about a typeface's width, the i does."

  body: "Rachel,\r\n\r\nI have been know to \"reset\" the space character for a number
    of fonts. Older composition systems did not have the spaceband as a character
    of the font, so this is common practice for a compositor.\r\n\r\nIf you have InDesign
    for example, copy in a page of text, and set it ragged right with your font. Change
    the percentage value for the ideal wordspace up or down until the text looks right,
    then multiply that percentage times the value you started with, and you have a
    proper spaceband value -- At least, one that fits your eye and for text sizes.\r\n\r\nHarder
    in a display font; the \"ideal\" spaceband value will vary with the setting size
    -- as a percentage, almost always smaller as the type gets bigger.\r\n\r\nPaul
    -- it is hard to do a search on this forum. I've tried the advance search function,
    but can't figure out how to get the \"and\" rather than the \"or.\""
