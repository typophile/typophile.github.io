  body: I compared the e and r repeats and it is a font - they are the same size if
    degraded in appearance. Beyond the fact it looks sort of familiar - I could not

  body: Would you happen to know any other type oriented forums like this one? I have
    to believe that someone out there has seen this font before. It was used in The
    mid 90's on this particular project.
