    contain custom fonts.  The entire alphabet is not available and may never be available.
    \ The letters are created as need arises for branding purposes.\r\n\r\nThe header
    fonts found on [[http://www.ClearCenter.com|ClearCenter]] and [[http://www.ClearFoundation.com|ClearFoundation]]
    are [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/neo-sans/|NeoSans]].\r\n\r\nFYI I am the
