  body: "It's probably custom, but I agree that it's a style that seems to resemble
    a blend of the two Optimas. That 'a' is not really like Nova very much, and there
    are other differences that make me think this is just an uneven sans design.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I would say it resembles Optima, but it would need some heavy customization
    though (especially on the letter e).\r\n\r\nOkay, what do you guys think about
    the tagline font? I found one that looked close enough to use, called Corbel.
    I'm still curious though to know which one it could be. The letter g is unmistakable.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Shaklee-Tagline_3690.gif]"
