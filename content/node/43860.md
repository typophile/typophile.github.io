  great quirky type sample called Egyptian Spur Modern in a sign etching book from
  around 1922 by Al Imelli called \"The Book of Alphabets and Layouts.\" I'm planning
  on using this face as a starting point for a logo I'm working on. Now, I've modified
  existing type and created a number of hand drawn logos, but have never really attempted
  to vectorize a type sample from the ground up. Any advice for a type designer ignoramus?
  Besides the obvious, how would you even categorize this face? Any typefaces you
  can think of that are even close I could use for reference? If it would help, I'd
  be more than happy to scan all the letters. Disregard any kerning or tracking issues
  for now...still the scans from the book.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    say the trick is to manage the \"pointedness\" of the serifs in different kinds
    of terminals, so that it's never too fine or too blunt."

  body: Yeah, I was really curious as to how I should end my serifs, rounded to maintain
    a bit of the weathered antiquity feel of the face or lop off just the tip to give
    a bit crisper feel. Thanks for the references Nick, those are the closest I've
    seen!

  body: "<em>...never too fine or too blunt.</em>\r\n\r\nTo clarify, as I didn't express
    that accurately enough: what I meant was that the angle of the serif tips should
    be fairly consistent, not that the tip should be chopped off--although that may
    be a solution in some places. If the tips of the serifs are chopped off, no matter
    how small the cut, it becomes an issue for scaling. Novarese's Symbol, for instance,
    dating from the phototype era, has a serif treatment that looks sharp in text,
    but gets clunkier the bigger it is used."
