body: Hi Everybody, <BR> <BR>A little background before my questions... <BR> <BR>-------
  <BR> <BR>I am just starting down the path of type design.  I am a graphic designer,
  but I&#39;ve never taken any type design classes &#40;nor can I seem to find any
  in the boston area&#41;. <BR> <BR>Right now I am at the point where I am reading
  an abundance of typography books &#40;not too many just on face design out there&#41;,
  and trying to study and understand the history and relationships between different
  styles and movements.  When I walk down the street, I don&#39;t even read any more
  -I just look at typefaces in signs and on newspapers, etc. <BR> <BR>I have made
  several attempts to design individual letters, but this has been pretty unsatisfying.  I
  usually attempt one or two letters, and really am not pleased with what I am producing.  I&#39;ve
  tried handwriting forms, and using Illustrator. &#40;I used to think I was pretty
  handy with the bezier curves - not any more&#41;. <BR> <BR>It appears there are
  some very experienced type designers on these boards &#40;apologies if that not
  your preferred nomenclature&#41;.  I even see a lot of &#34;first time&#34; designs,
  and that is even more frustrating, because they have so many great details and ideas
  that feel out of reach.    I feel like I can&#39;t even create adequate stem weight
  for the letter &#34;A&#34;, much less create a whole typeface. <BR> <BR>-------
  <BR> <BR>On to the questions... <BR> <BR>Could some of you suggest some strategies
  for trying to organize a truly first time attempt at creating an alphabet?  Is handrawing
  the way to go?  Playing with existing typefaces?  Some kind of master chart for
  proportions?  Picking apart the anatomy of serifs, bowls, ears, terminals, etc?
  <BR> <BR>I just don&#39;t know where to go from my current position &#40;the very
  beginning&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m definitely a neophyte, and any approaches or steps
  for creating some kind of structure to my effort would really be appreciated.  Even
  a homework assignment or two would help. <BR> <BR>Thanks very much, <BR> <BR>bgh

  body: '&#62; I don&#39;t even read any more <BR> <BR>Then you&#39;re in!  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>But don&#39;t start from individual glyphs and try to form a font, go
    the other way: develop a feeling &#40;or if you have to, Rules&#41; for the whole&#42;
    and then try to figure out what the individual glyphs need to be - because a font
    &#40;especially a text font&#41; is only its parts out of necessity, not as a
    goal. On the other hand, it&#39;s also very common &#40;I do it a lot&#41; to
    start with some actual glyphs out of the blue &#40;since their tangibility makes
    them so attractive&#41;, and get the feeling/rules from there, but only if you
    leave open the possibility &#40;even probability&#41; of changing or even dumping
    those initial seeds. <BR> <BR>&#42; And absobing history and existing designs
    like you&#39;re doing is a great catalyst. <BR> <BR>Handwriting &#40;or &#34;chirography&#34;,
    in the realm of type&#41; is a good start only if you want a quick and easy way
    of producing something mainstream. The best source is what&#39;s inside you as
    a person, not any physical tool. <BR> <BR>One &#34;precedent&#34; you should definitely
    mind though is what readers expect. Don&#39;t let it be a straightjacket, but
    do factor it in, like when you decide what stems need to be thick and which ones
    thin - precedent will often dispell much of the arbitrariness in design. <BR>
    <BR>And don&#39;t push inspiration. When it comes naturally it will all just fall
    into place. <BR> <BR>&#62; homework <BR> <BR>You&#39;re in luck! <BR><a href="http://typophile.com/articles/"

  body: Brant, I&#39;ve made one real attempt at designing a text face and I know
    <i>exactly</i> how you feel. I made it through the LC and UC alphabet and had
    some experiences that may help you go further. <BR> <BR>1&#41; Get a chisel-tip
    pen and some ink and a &#39;basic calligraphy&#39; book. Start to write the alphabet,
    but also play around with the line quality and curves. If you&#39;re holding the
    pen at the proper angle, using the recommended strokes, and controlling proportions,
    a lot of the characters will start to seem intuitive &#40;this requires a lot
    of repition, but as a scrutinizer of type, you have a leg up on the rest of the
    world&#41;. Now, I realize that this is a stylistically limited exercise, but
    it really helped me to see the glyphs for what they are. Using a tool that can
    modulate stroke-width on the fly is very illuminating. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Trace the
    skeletons of some fonts. Don&#39;t focus on stroke-width or fillets of serifs,
    just draw the monoline structure of the characters. You&#39;ll start to see the
    commonalities and differences in periods and styles. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s
    a book that can give you the &#39;accepted method&#39; for determining this underlying
    structure. I would print out big ol&#39; 12 pica alphabets &#40;UC &amp; LC&#41;
    and lay tracing paper over them to do this. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if either
    of these are Official Type Designing Methods, but they helped illuminate many
    of the subtlties of type and letters for me. I recommend avoiding beziers and
    the computer for learing to draw these forms. For me, I do my best bezier manipulating
    when it&#39;s over a strong drawing I&#39;ve scanned in.

  body: Brant, <BR> <BR>One big thing that helped me understand letterforms was simply
    copying from specimen books. I&#39;d take a pencil and paper and draw a complete
    alphabet -- Caslon, for instance. This made me pay attention to details that I
    normally wouldn&#39;t see. If my &#34;a&#34; didn&#39;t look like the specimen
    &#34;a&#34;, I would study it further to understand why. This also helps you understand
    relationships among letterforms when you draw them together, all the same size,
    on one page. <BR> <BR>Get as many specimens as you can, and not just old ones.
    Some foundries will mail a free specimen of their types and others have PDF specimens
    you can download. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/mailing_list.html">The

    sure you&#39;re aware of all the online type foundries. <BR> <BR>Hrant and Chris
    offer good advice as well -- I decided to draw letters because my writing sucks.
    Drawing letters digitally is a whole new ballgame, and I&#39;m still struggling
    with that. <BR> <BR>The Typophile courses Hrant pointed out are great, too. They&#39;re
    done by the great Mr. Hoefler. <BR> <BR>Good luck, <BR>Addison
