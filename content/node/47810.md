  ago while looking for something else I saved a typeface for a future project. That
  project is now here and my mind is blank for the name of the icon face. Its a weird
  one made up of circular symbols with lines through them and around them. Its got
  a kind of naval/military feel with lots of shapes that look like roundels and blips
  for boats and planes. Easy to re-draw but some of them were really interesting.
  The only thing I can think of as reference is General Symbols 05.\r\n-\r\nhttp://img61.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture10do5.png\r\n-\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n"
