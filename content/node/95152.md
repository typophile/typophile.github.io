    de vivre, and a certain je ne sais quoi! \r\n\r\ntwo articles with some insights.

  body: Ryan, why do <cite>you</cite> think it's amazing? The question as it stands
    somehow almost doesn't do justice to the answer.

  body: Not to be a smartass, but if I knew I wouldn't be asking.  I've been trying
    to figure out what takes a typeface from competent to amazing for a while now.  What
    is that thing?

    (thanks to yours truly :-). But if you're really into the subject, \"Excoffon
    et la fonderie Olive\" is a must too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "At the start of my career, I used Antique Olive a lot (though not the elephantine
    Nord weight). I even used transfer lettering to set my second freelance business
    card in Antique Olive.\r\nIt was the Age of Helvetica, and the popular sans-serifs
    were all monoline, and therefore tiresome to read at small sizes and too bland
    to attract attention at display sizes. Optima was a nice alternative, but even
    at its heaviest weight, Optima was just too damn tasteful. \r\nThen I discovered
    Antique Olive. It had lots of punch, and was full of the little eccentricities
    that other sans-serifs lacked: The vertical cutoffs on the <strong>C</strong>,
    <strong>G</strong>, and <strong>S</strong>; the unexpectedly square bowls on the
    <strong>P</strong> and <strong>R</strong>; and the way the curved strokes taper
    when joining the straight strokes on <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>,<strong>d</strong>,
    <strong>g</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, <strong>m</strong>, <strong>n</strong>,
    <strong>p</strong>, <strong>q</strong>, <strong>r</strong>, and <strong>u</strong>.
    \r\nThat's what amazed me as a newbie. Some of my early font faves kind of embarrass
    me now, but I'm still a big fan of Antique Olive. "
