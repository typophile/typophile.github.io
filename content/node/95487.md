  \r\n\r\nIf not how would you go about discovering this information? \r\n\r\nI am
  thinking particularly of historically popular fonts in Denmark. \r\nI do not need
  a 100% accurate result...a result that tells me that a particular font was likely
  high in popularity at a given date would be adequate. \r\n\r\nDates might be as
  far back as the 1750s to today. \r\n"

    typefaces used in books, or newspapers, or advertising. Or, in more recent times,
    in shop signs."
