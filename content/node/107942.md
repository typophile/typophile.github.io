    \"white space\" characters? If the encoding  is to be a Unicode-based (as opposed
    to a PostScript name-based font), you'll find a number of characters already assigned
    for spaces, just ready for you to fill in values. See Unicode \"General Punctuation\"
    (U+2000 through U+ 2011). You probably shouldn't cheat on the values of spaces
    based on the em, but \"thin\" and \"hair\" have no exact meaning, and you could
    use them as you see fit. While the \"figure\" and \"punctuation\" spaces kinda
    sorta have meanings, you could probably cheat a little and use them, too. \r\n\r\nJust
    fill out whatever value you want in the metrics window, and voil\xE0!\r\n\r\nIf
    you are actually talking about a character that \"has black as well as white,\"
    you need to make, say, three copies of the glyph you want, and scale each glyph
    separately, using tools > action > contour > scale > (fill in values). There probably
    is a way to get the program to work so you only have to use the command one time
    (instead of three), but you'll spend far more time figuring it out than just running
    it three times.\r\n"

  body: "Nick and Charles! Thank you so much for the help, I really appreciate it!
    You folks are awesome!\r\n\r\nNick, that's a good question. I'm actually trying
    to replicate blank characters like the ones found in Adobe Blank font:\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2013/03/introducing-adobe-blank.html\r\n\r\nFor
    my font, I have a logo on the \"M\" and \"m\" glyphs. My goal is to create \"blank\"
    glyphs for several other characters so I can type my name and have only the \"M\"
    (or \"m\") show a version of my logo. For more info see here:\r\n\r\nhttp://scottkellum.com/2013/10/25/the-new-kellum-method.html\r\n\r\nI
    had posted a question on Stack asking for help on how to create \"blank\" glyphs
    in FontLab ... Based on the one reply given, I ended up posting my own answer:\r\n\r\nhttp://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/25858/10258\r\n\r\nThe
    above are the steps I'm taking to create a \"non-spacing and non-marking glyph\".
    I think I've got all the steps figured out, except for the suggestion of applying
    \"Scale (1%) \xD7 3 times\".\r\n\r\nBased on both of you replies, I now understand
    that the \"x 3 times\" means \"do it 3 times\". The only issue is, I'm not sure
    of the field I should input \"1%\". Here's a screen shot of the Actions -> Scale
    Glyph window:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1277106/scale-fontlab.png\">\r\n\r\nHere's
    what it looks like after I've input \"1\" in the width input field (and turned
    on \"proportional\"):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1277106/scale-fontlab-result.png\">\r\n\r\nBut,
    is that the same as \"1%\"? As you can see in that second screenshot, the \"%\"
    isn't there (it gets removed after I've applied the action).\r\n\r\nWith all of
    that said, I apologize for not giving more information in my first post.\r\n\r\nReally,
    my main goal is to create \"non-spacing and non-marking glyphs\", just like the
    Adobe Blank, but for only a few glyphs and I'll eventually generate a web font
    using Font Squirrel.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've documented my steps (with screen shots)
    in the graphicdesign.stackexchange.com link above.\r\n\r\nSorry to chat your ears
    off. I'm just super happy that I've met some folks on the web who are willing
    to help me out! :)\r\n\r\nCharles, thanks so much for the details! I'm going to
    experiment with your ideas this weekend. I'm sure I'll be back with more questions.\r\n\r\n(Does
    anyone know how I can get e-mail notifications when there's a reply to a thread
    I'm involved in?) ... (Also, how do edit my own posts? I don't seem to have that
    ability. Maybe I don't have enough rep yet? <strong>Edit: Wait, I see an edit
    link on this post ... Just, for some reason, there's no \"edit\" link for my first
    post/question above.</strong>)\r\n\r\nMany TIAs!!!!!!"

    place on the bezier curves, it's not meant to change width in space-only characters.
    It may do so, but that wasn't the purpose of the tool. For space-only modification,
    you set the width directly, either in the glyph window by pulling the \"width\"
    bar, or easiest, in the metrics window, by directly assigning the width you want.\r\n\r\nIt
    should be clear to you that you're using the program in ways the developers didn't
    intend, so the best course of action would be to try something & see the result.
    Essentially, what you're doing is asking us to try these little tests for you,
    then report back. Problem with that is, as always, communication. (Nor should
    you be offended if no one wants to play.)"

    for me was that I did not realize that box was a percentage value. I don't think

    me the light.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Try a little test with a character where the
    character is not simply \"space,\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI will do! You are right,
    I should've done that before asking here. I dunno, I guess I feel there's something
    kinda \"magical\" when it comes to font creation tools. I don't know enough to
    feel confident that the end result will be exactly what I envision, so that's
    why I'm coming here. :(\r\n\r\n<blockquote>2. But the \"scale\" action takes place

    fresh font that only has bezier curves for \"M\" and \"m\", and the rest are just
    blanks. Thinking out loud here: You're saying that if I drag the \"width\" bar
    to zero, that should be enough work to get the end result I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nI
    will experiment this weekend and post back my findings (maybe my ramblings will

  body: "If you want non-marking and non-spacing glyphs in FontLab Studio, I don't
    understand why you are doing all this scaling operation on marking and spacing
    glyphs. There are a bunch of easier ways.\r\n\r\nTo create a non-marking and non-spacing
    glyph in FontLab Studio:\r\n- go to the font window.\r\n- double-click on any
    unused (grey) glyph slot shown in the font\r\n\r\nThe glyph slot will turn white.
    You are done.\r\n\r\nIf the glyph you want is not visible as a grey unused slot,
    you may need to select a different encoding view. \r\n\r\nOr you can use the \"Generate
    Glyph\" dialog. Let's say your first blank glyph is in the cap A slot, and you
    want more as B, C and D. At the font window, go to Glyph > Generate Glyphs (Cmd-G).
    Type \"A=B A=C A=D\" and hit OK. Or copy your \"A\" glyph and paste into B, C
    and D.\r\n\r\nYou can even use the Generate Glyphs dialog to generate empty non-spacing
    glyphs when you don't have any defined yet, because if you use a name it doesn't
    recognize as the input, it will create... an empty non-spacing glyph. So for example
    if you use the dialog and type in it \"xyz=Irving xyz=Forbush\" even though you
    have no glyph named xyz, you will still create glyphs named Irving and Forbush.\r\n\r\nAnother
    route: once you have one such glyph (created as above), you can select an existing
    empty white glyph in the font window. Copy it, then do a contextual click (right-click
    or Ctrl-click) and choose \"append glyph.\" A copy will get added to the end of
    the font, with a default name derived from the original glyph's name. You'll need
    to fix the encoding and name of the glyph, which you can do with another contextual
    click and selecting \"properties\" and editing in the resulting window."

    you are looking to do. I''m puzzled about the 3 x 1% thing. Where did it come
    from? Also, I''ve had occasion to create fonts similar to the Adobe Blank Font
    but was able to cut down greatly on file size by duplicating the "blank" glyph
    by designating an initial glyph as a "master" to be inserted as a component into
    as many character slots as there needs to be. (Works great for repeating the same
    outline over and over again while adding next to nothing to the file size because
    a large part of the data is simply a pointer to a glyph contained within the same
    character, over and over again.) '
