body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Tools]] : [[Type Design Tools]] : Visual TrueType (VTT)</strong>\r\n\r\nExpert's
  font tool from Microsoft for dealing with the low level software language of editing
  [[hinting]] information for [[TrueType]] fonts, and [[OpenType]] fonts using TrueType
  outlines (<a href=\"http://graphics.cs.ucdavis.edu/GraphicsNotes/Quadratic-Bezier-Curves/Quadratic-Bezier-Curves.html\">Quadratic
  Bezier</a>) for the glyphs. The program itself is friendly enough, but [[TrueType
  hints]] are encoded in their own stack-based programming language -- as complicated
  as the language used to describe font outlines themselves -- and the GUI can go
  only so far to mask the complexity and power of the hints. \r\n\r\nOriginally designed
  by the architect of the TrueType font format, <a href=\"http://www.typesolutions.com/\">Sampo
  Kaasila</a>. Released as 'TypeMan' for the Macintosh. Completely rewritten by Beat
  Stamm of Microsoft Typography and released for both Windows and the Macintosh. \r\n\r\nAvailable
  from <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx\">Microsoft Typography</a>
  upon completion of an application. Both Windows and Mac OS are supported."
