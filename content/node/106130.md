  Indian Typefaces.\r\n\r\nEk Type is a collaborative type foundry based in India
  that specializes in developing fonts across Indian languages, many of which will
  be multi-script. Giving adequate importance to script grammar and script tradition,
  it produces standardized and compatible fonts in multiple weights, supporting all
  platforms for print and screen.\r\n\r\nEk Type comprises of experienced type designers,
  researchers and academicians spanning a wide age group with different skill sets
  which help complement each other. Apart from developing and selling fonts, Ek Type
  will create documentation and awareness about Indian typography. In addition to
  this, it will mentor upcoming type designers by engaging with them in the process
  of design development and providing a platform to showcase their work.\r\n\r\nIn
  several Indian languages, \u2018Ek\u2019 is synonymous to 'one'. Ek type exemplifies
  what it means by providing a roof, under 'one' umbrella and serving as an open collaborative
  platform to develop and sell fonts, inviting others to be a part of it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ek
