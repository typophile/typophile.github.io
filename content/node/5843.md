body: I need to know what font is used &#40;or derived or the closest approximation&#41;
  in the Milky Way candy bar logo. <BR> <BR>I have an assignment where I have to design
  a font from this logo.  To my sensibilities, there some bad design in the letterforms-
  the &#34;a&#34;, for example, or the fact that some letters are curved upwards and
  others are not.  Any help is appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41712.jpg"

  body: As I understand it, the challenge of the assignment is to analyse  <BR>the
    available character shapes and extrapolate them to other  <BR>characters in order
    to achieve a complete alphabet. If we were to  <BR>point you to a similar typeface,
    wouldn&#39;t that be considered...  <BR><i>cheating?</i> If I were you, I&#39;d
    start by sketching the other characters  <BR>and post them in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29.html?1091170459"

    around.

  body: I guess it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be considered cheating since I was supplied
    with a font &#40;Diamanti Condensed&#41; by the art director to use as a basis/inspiration.  I
    believe the logo was designed 40&#43; years ago and appears to be a custom design,
    otherwise, I think a font would have been used or supplied by the company with
    no need for a newly created font.  But, as per your suggestion, I&#39;ve already
    been sketching in pencil and in Illustrator possible ideas for characters and
    I&#39;ll probably post the results in the Critique section for feedback.

  body: As someone much older than 40, I can say that I don&#39;t think that Milky
    Way logo is that old. My recollection is that they used to have a script not that
    many years ago. It was the same color, but it wasn&#39;t that lettering &#40;I
    think&#41;. <BR> <BR>The current lettering is almost surely a custom design, but
    I agree with Yves. If your instructor gave you something to use, then that should
    be all the &#39;help&#39; you&#39;ll need. <BR> <BR>James, you&#39;re trying to
    learn design, not copying, right? And it doesn&#39;t matter if you disapprove
    of the letterforms, since your assignment is to design something based on it.
    Think of it as a client who loves this lettering and wants to expand the hand-drawn
    logo into a typeface for other ad copy, not someone asking you to design something
    you like.

  body: Definitely not the <a href="http://www.packagemuseum.com/packagemuseum/exhibits/milkyway01/milkyway01.htm"
    target="_blank">original logo...</a> but how recent I don&#39;t know. I seem to
    remember more of a script as well &#40;and I am 40&#41;. <BR> <BR>Well, <a href="http://www.milkywaybar.com/facts/timeline.html"
    target="_blank">here</a> you have it. Not that this has anything to do with the
    original query. <BR> <BR>This logo dates from 1999 and joins the long long list
    of watered-down redesigns we&#39;ve been besieged with recently including Wrigleys
    gum, UPS, Cynar liqueur and the American currency system. Don&#39;t get me started.

  body: It&#39;s a little-known fact that in the arctic and antarctic latitudes in
    their respective summers, the Milky Way Midnight bar is actually made with white
    chocolate, owing to the midnight sun. Also, the nougat swirls to the left in the
    southern hemisphere, whereas it swirls to the right in the northern, but that&#39;s
    a different force of nature altogether.

    and right with the world. Seriously, I would hate to find myself at a convenience
    store at the north pole in July and have my options so severely limited.

    why not Milky Way in these discussions? Much more interesting than the endless
    Prada, car logos and soccer jerseys.

  body: So since the new Milky Way logo is so weak, I decided to do a redesign. After
    much deliberation, I decided the best thing to add edge and coolness to the brand
    would be Bold Comic Sans MS, stretched to 140% and run through the &#34;Drop Shadow&#34;
    and &#34;Inner Shadow&#34; Photoshop filters. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41774.jpg"

    all seriousness though, I totally agree about some of these redesigns, like Wrigley&#39;s
    and especially the US money. uch. At least Dunkin&#39; Donuts was brave enough
    not to ditch Frankfurter during their redesign -- I totally dig their logo.&#41;

  body: It&#39;s been fun with all this kidding around, but the one thing they try
    to keep is enough continuity to maintain brand recognition. Patricia&#39;s link
    early in this thread showed that. The green lettering has been around a long time,
    even if the shape of the letters has changed. So has the use of chocolate and
    nougat &#40;sortof&#41; colors, behind those letters.  You see those things and
    you don&#39;t really need to see the lettering. You already know it&#39;s Milky
    Way. That kind of recognition is priceless in a competitive market. <BR> <BR>OK,
    now I have to go back and think about what Chesh said about the Midnight Sun and
    the Coriolis effect. Huh? ;-&#41; <BR>
