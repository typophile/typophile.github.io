body: "So, I'm, uh, in Japan for a week. Is there, uh, anything typographically interesting
  I should see when I'm here? I realize that this is high on the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12938\">list</a>
  of things not to say on Typophile, but hey, wouldn't be the first time.\r\n\r\nI
  bought a lavishly produced magazine called \"Design Note 2\" that has a section
  on fonts. I didn't find any books of particular interest, but that's just the bookstore
  nearest the hotel (I'm staying near Shinjuku station). Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI'm
  amazed by the amount of branding and corporate identity that's in English. At one
  mall we passed on the train, every single sign was in English (one also had the
  name in a much smaller Japanese font). Sans is really big here - I'd estimate that
  over half the English signage I've seen is either in Helvetica or Univers (or a
  fair copy thereof). Eurostyle is also surprisingly popular. Just in terms of the
  typographic environment, it feels like a throwback to the '70s. I was expecting
  something hipper, more now. I was also surprised at how mediocre the Roman typography
  tends to be, especially in fit and spacing. I'm sure the Japanese will feel the
  same about me if I try and produce Japanese typography - it's gotta be an issue
  of familiarity with the native ways, as I <i>love</i> Japanese design and visual
  art in general.\r\n"
