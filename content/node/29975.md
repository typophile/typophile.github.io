    but when I get there I'll have a look at my shelf and see if I have anything to
    add or suggest. For the moment, how do we add reviews?\r\n\r\nEdit: Oh, right,
    you mentioned to email such bits to you. Gotcha."

    this is only an interim solution. There will be a whole new area, hopefully with
    tagging capabilities of somesort, in the next year."

    could have a 'new books' section and encourage people especially to do reviews
    there... \r\n\r\nWill this be linked to the 'resources' section eventually?\r\n\r\n*eg\r\n\r\nPrinters

    NEW books. When I add a book to the section it would be added to the top of the
    page, perhaps I could add the word NEW."

  body: "I was wondering about the stacking order; obviously it would be nice if the
    lists were alphabetical (by title?), but if books are on multiple lists this would
    require some scripting.\r\n\r\nAny chance of a \"Book Design\" section? (Not strictly
    typography, but not quite Book Arts or Printing Arts.)\r\n\r\nAlso, perhaps a
    Magazines section listing currently published design magazines (<em>CA, Print,</em>
    etc.)?\r\n\r\nTiff, I'm home now and am brimming over with stuff to compile &
    send you. Get ready..."

  body: "Yes the overlap is a result of being able to tag, sort of, in the previous
    version of Typophile Books.\r\n\r\nWe can definitely add a book design section.\r\n\r\nAlphabetical
    by title would be good.\r\n\r\nMagazines, another good idea.\r\n\r\nJason, you
    send and I'll post."

  body: "A few thoughts from my dreams last night. (Yes, after I work on something
    intensely for a few days it haunts me in my sleep.) I hope you all don't mind
    helping me.\r\n\r\n- I'd like to remove overlap. If you see books that are overlapped,
    please point them out to me. (I'll look as well.) We'll vote on where they belong
    for real.\r\n- I do want to add Book Design and Calligraphy/Lettering is a good
    idea too.\r\n- If you see a book in one section and feel it belongs elsewhere
    please tell me. \r\n- Again, don't be afraid to point out errors. For instance,
    I realize that all of the books attached to Robin Kinross have the wrong publisher.
    (This will be fixed immediately.) \r\n\r\nJason, you are a model citizen. Everyone
    please note how Jason sent me information to be added and follow in his noble
    footsteps.\r\n\r\n<ol>Designing Type\r\nby Karen Cheng\r\nPublisher: Yale University
    Press; (April 3, 2006)\r\nPaperback: 224 pages\r\nISBN: 0300111509\r\nPrice: $29.95

    \r\nJason Dewinetz: While I've read a few comments both positive & negative on
    this book, as a reader with no formal training in type design I've found the book
    very useful towards a better understanding of how digital glyphs are put together,
    based one on another, etc. A well produced & finely illustrated publication.</ol>\r\n\r\nI
    realize there have been threads dedicated to horror of Amazon. Please consider
    that in this instance it is serving a very real and good purpose. When you purchase
    from Amazon you are doing a small part to support Typophile. So, consider if you
    are going to suggest a book please check to see if it is available on Amazon first.
    Then, if it isn't please do give the link for the other site. \r\n\r\nThis could
    be a great resource for everyone looking for books. I hope you are all as enthusiastic
    about it and ready to participate! Go team!\r\n"
