body: Any recommendations for fonts that work with [[Optima]]? Its kind of a tough
  one because Optima is half serif and half san serif.

  body: "Optima works well with Palatino, also by Zapf. The amazing thing about this
    whole group (Optima, Palatino, Michaelangelo, Sistina, Kompakt, Gilgenhart, Phidias
    Greek, and ultimately Aldus) is that they ALL work together. \r\n\r\nI do not
    have any problems with Optima, other than overuse, like others. It functions very
    well, and now that they have expanded the face to include condensed versions and
    additional \"approved\" weights it will endure... even if it displeases other
    type designers. \r\n\r\nYeah, it's easy to trash, by some, (a lot of times I think
    that is nothing more than gang mentality) but it has endured for 50 years : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

    with personality. An undeniable touch of the hand. I know I am extremely biased.
    I don't apologize for it. And try to not be too antagonistic anymore.\r\n\r\nAnd
    certainly Optima is not suited for everything. I love Universe, Poppl Laudatio
