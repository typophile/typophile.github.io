body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I just finished the cover design for a book geared toward helping
  executives maximize growth by choosing and nurturing the right people. I used Avenir
  on the cover and I plan to use it for heads and subheads inside the book. I&#39;m
  starting to think about possible companion font for the body and I need help. What
  do you think of Electra? On second thought that may be a little to light. Anyway
  any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
