  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Evening all -  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was hoping I could tap this board's divine wisdom for a moment and receive a little feedback / advice on an a4 leaflet I have designed. I'm wanting the typography to be absoloutely water tight, and as one who's very much still learning his trade, a few words from those more experienced than I would prove invaluable.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The main typeface used is Adobe Warnock and I have used Interstate for the brief note on the back page. I'm not convinved Interstate is the best choice - but with a limited number of fonts on my system, I think it's the best I can do. Suggestions of others to use still appreciated. Oh yes&hellip; there's also a Caslon fleuron on the front. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you all kindly <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leaflet<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->b2b_front.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (158.4 k)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">A few tiny points: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. I would lose the discretionary ligs. They give a slighly antiquarian, belle-lettristic impression. Asylum is too important (and too &quot;modern&quot;) a subject for that. You can probably keep the fleurons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Do you need the underlining. I hate underlining, and I would have thought the bold does the job well enough without. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. You have 4.00pm to 7:30pm (ie full point in one time, colon in another). I think you should be consistent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Why are the dates in italic under the &quot;lectures&quot; heading on p.1? Why are the subtitles in italic but the lecture titles underlined in the brief details on p.2. Maybe there is a reason for this, but I can't see it immediately. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5. Could you drop the bookings heading on p. 1 so that it aligned with venue and then use the full width of the textblock to give the dates and titles of the lectures. This is what people are really interested in. If they want to go to the lecture, they will search out the other information. But the subject of the lectures really needs to stand out. (This I know because I'm a lawyer and this is the kind of stuff we get all the time: what makes the difference is whether the topic of the lectures interests you.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->6. By the same token, I think there's too much prominence being given to the HJT Training mark, and not enough to the title. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7. To my eye, page 1 is dropping below down the page. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->8. I quite like the interstate, but I think it is so small that it looks like legal &quot;small print&quot; . It needs to be bigger and less apologetic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Luke, I can see you're going the classic route, and have done a pretty good job of keeping it real. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are two things that jump out, as not being &quot;by the book&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first is, as Paul says, the underlining. It's not classic because you couldn't do it in metal &ndash; in particular the way the underline passes through descenders is nasty. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I can see why you did it &ndash; there is a complex hierarchy in the layout, you ran out of options, and the Warnock Bold does not appear sufficiently stronger than the Regular. But it is, and it should be, and if it's not, then the layout should be adjusted to give it enough prominence: try a little more space above the bold subheads. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Secondly, the use of figures is inconsistent, mixing old style with lining. If you're going old-school, stick with the OSF everywhere, except in headings with all caps, where you should use roman numerals (just kidding), I mean, cap height figures.</div>
