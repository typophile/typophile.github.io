body: "Hi\r\n\r\nYears ago I had a document where Freehand replaced a font with Adobe
  Sans, and that looked pretty cool. I'd like to re-create that effect now, but I
  don't know if that would still work \u2013 instead of ATM I use FontExplorer X,
  it also has Adobe Sans installed. Does anyone know how I can get InDesign or Illustrator
  to replace a certain typeface with Adobe Sans now?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nI."

  body: If you have FontLab you can generate a specific instance of Adobe Sans - then
    give it a New Name like Adobe Sans Fat or Thin - then generate and load it as
    a new font. This works with other MM fonts and everything I have tried to get
    multi masters installed in current versions of Adobe apps have not worked - such
    as putting font in app specific font folder, or into app package font folder etc.

  body: It's quite easy to get Adobe Sans or Adobe Serif to display in Acrobat or
    Adobe Reader. Just make a PDF where the fonts are neither embedable nor the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format#Base_14_fonts|base
    14]].
