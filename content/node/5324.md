  body: is Reading better than St.Martins? I&#39;ve been planning on studying there
    &#40;it&#39;s still a question, whether they&#39;d like me to&#41;, but, seeing
    the Reading Graphic Communication programme I start to wonder which one would
    give me most.

  body: hihihihi -- Seriously. Reading changed me. They introduced me to a whole new
    realm into the world of typography.

  body: I suppose the biggest problem would be that Reading is in Reading which is
    about 30 minutes &#40;by fast train&#41; outside of London. So if you are deadset
    on studying IN London, then Reading would be a daily commute.

    to many students, and they all think they are Jarvis Cocker...  <BR> <BR>

    <BR>They have MA to part time vocational courses. <BR>I was here in the early
    80s, certainly not as attractively positioned as St Martins &#40;sharing a roundabout
    with a pink shopping centre and a shiny box&#41; Although I thoroughly enjoyed
    it. As reputations go it was well regarded, I cannot comment on the current situation.
    As for Jim
