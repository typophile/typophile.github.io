  body: "\"Gare De Lyon\" and Dijon, Vallorbe e.t.c. match Chambord Condensed, also
    by Roger Excoffon 1945-51 and released in several weights and Italic by the Fonderie
    Olive. As far as I know Chambord has not been digitized. For a full alphabet specimen
    see \r\nJaspert's Encylopedia of Type faces, 1970, at p. 259.\r\nDon"

  body: Amazing, really helpful - thanks. What do you think about the bottom line
    (BEOGRAD), a mix between Bold/Condensed Bold Futura?

    are also related to Chambord but far from matching it.\r\nBEOGRAD: don't know
