  in Dan x Solo's book 'gothic and old english alphabets' from 1984. Known as monmouth
  back then, but the blackletter font now also known as monmouth is completely different
  so the one I want is difficult to search for... any idea if this font was renamed
  at some point? Similar fonts accepted...\r\n\r\nimage attached\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\na\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monmouth_4837.jpg]"
