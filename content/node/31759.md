  body: "Found an answer here: http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/\r\n\r\nThat,
    with some Googling of Typophile (since the search here choked) explains it a bit.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone else is reading this, some Adobe CS programs seems to support -hlig-, but
    only by binding control to the UI element for -dlig-.\r\n\r\n-hist- on the other
    hand, is supported by Quark.\r\n\r\nWhat a bummer, as that leaves the choice of
    the user a bit bound up."

  body: "Actually, InDesign supports the 'hist' feature. However, it can only by accessed
    through scripting, not through the UI. The property is called 'otfHistorical'.\r\n\r\nThe
    last page of the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf\">OpenType
    User Guide for Adobe Fonts</a> (PDF file) shows you a list of which features are
    supported by Adobe's applications."

  body: "<cite>-hist- on the other hand, is supported by Quark.</cite>\r\n\r\nAt least
    as regards the earlier XPress7 beta, some features are listed as \"supported\",
    but e.g. for 'hist' and 'zero' this means that you have to select the according
    glyphs via the glyph palette."

  body: "I am trying to decide the scheme for accessing ligatures in my upcoming faces.
    Today, I think am going to mostly ignore the eccentricities of application support,
    and arrange things as I feel suits the specification descriptions.\r\n\r\nDo others
    feel that OpenType is \"young enough\" that conventions, compatibilities and methods
    of access are still in progress? I know there are features I could include that
    aren't yet supported by any major application."

  body: "Oh, liga and clig (for standard and contextual standard ligatures) for ligatures,
    and dlig (for special ligatures), should be your first choices. If an application
    supports OT features, then these two are most likely supported.\r\nFor additional
    things, maybe one of the Stylistic Set features might do. But these were not intended
    for ligatures and are available in InDesign CS2 only. (And in some recent Apple
    applications, but here, one can only select one Stylistic Set feature at the same
    time. Which is why I mention it only in parentheses.)"

    in the proper places, and let applications deal with it. There aren't going to
    be that many OT features in !Lestatic, anyhow."

  body: "It's only accessible through the glyph panel and scripting, not a simple
    UI toggle (and not in styles).\r\n\r\nAs for why, because not enough people care.
    There has been some movement in this area recently, TBD whether it will result
    in any changes. Of course, if you're still on a five-year-old version of the app,
    you won't see any changes."
