  body: "You'd get pretty close with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica-inserat/\">Helvetica
    Inserat</a> with a bit of flattening and a tweak to the E corner points. (In other
    words, I think this is customized from an existing font -- the letters are not
    very distinctive, so it could be based on many fonts).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
