  I\u2019m currently creating a font which contains 3 different widths for each character.\r\nImagine
  condensed, normal, extended.\r\n\r\nIs it, and how, possible to let the typeface
  itself change, or say randomly pick, one of these 3 possible widths while i\u2019m
  typing it in inDesign? In heard that some handwriting typefaces apply such glyph-exchange-techniques
  to not let the typeface appear to stiff in a larger text.\r\n\r\nAny help or further
  reading is very much appreciated!\r\nbest wishes\r\nJohannes\r\n\r\n"

  body: I have found a lot of useful information from this platform. <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Agency
    for recruitment</a>  I must say that sharing your thoughts with one another is
    an easy way to relax yourself in the daily hectic routines. Each time a description
    of the change, there are always lots of talk about it anywhere. <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Recruitment
    agency in Pakistan</a>  These are not exempt. I mean one must be up to date with
    the day to day change in the environment and in the technology as well. <a href="http://www.recruitmentagenciesinpakistan.com/">Recruitment
    group</a>  In my personal opinion, the world is turning into a global village
    and now you can get a lot of required information by just a click while sitting
    where ever you are.
