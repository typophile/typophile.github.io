  body: "AndrewAndreas comes close, but you\u2019d have to add a point to the |V|
    and lower the waist on the |R|:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/andrew-andreas/\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if this might not be a customization of a mix of Neutraface (for the low-waisted
    |R|) and Neutraface 2 (for the mid-waisted |E|). Clip the terminals on the |V|,
    |A|, and |R|, and you are damned close:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/t/0f580e\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/t/c24a48"
