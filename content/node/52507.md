body: "I'm new to this all, so I've chosen these two fonts as my kerning and height
  yardsticks. To be fair, a full-on Swiss Helvetica gave me the ascender and descender
  guidelines for this typeface, but I've ridden roughshod over that already - conventionality
  belongs to yesterday.\r\n\r\nBoth Avante Garde (especially the ligatures) and Akzidenz
  Grotesk are favourites of mine anyway, so maybe delving deep into my psyche, this
  is actually my way of entering into an undending circle of love."
