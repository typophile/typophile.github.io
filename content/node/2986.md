  body: It looks like some custom-modified type. The C looks hand-drawn &#40;and not
    very well&#41;. The other characters look like they are from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cochin/italic/testdrive.html?s=ascades&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Cochin Italic</a> or possibly <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/snell-roundhand-script/snell-roundhand-script/testdrive.html?s=ascades&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Snell Roundhand</a> &#40;or maybe even a combination of the two&#41;
    with further modifications, such as the slant. Given the general unevenness of
    the characters, it may be that it is several generations removed from the original
    artwork. Either that, or it&#39;s just not very well drawn. <BR> <BR>I think the
    tag line is actually <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/casablanca/urw-t-light-condensed/testdrive.html?s=A%a0SERENITY%a0DAY%a0SPA&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Casablanca Condensed</a>, not Bodega Sans.

    <BR> <BR>Hard to tell at that size though.'

  body: Could very well be. I knew Image Club had a font like that, but I couldn&#39;t
    remember the name.  <BR> <BR>Both of them were apparently derived from an old
    metal Spanish face called Electra &#40;Nacional foundry&#41;, although Decotura
    seems to diverge from the original in various ways.

    riffs on that original face as well.

  body: Mark, it looks like you&#39;re right on the tag. The previous agency on this
    account was using Bodega for all headers, so I assumed that&#39;s what it was
    since they do look close in style. <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re also correct on
    the Cascades thing. I finally received an EPS of the logo, and it looks just as
    bad in its original format as it does in this JPG. <BR> <BR>Oh well, they&#39;re
    looking to revise their identity soon anyway, hopefully I&#39;ll get a shot at
    it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for all your help.
