    rather than starting yet another one.

  body: "Hello Again.\r\n\r\nLamaKova, you are correct there is a  lighter shade which
    would be interesting, but I was actually thinking of the jewel tone arils (see
    picture)\r\n\r\n1.) I still see some spacing issues that are more apparent with
    the tighter kern. \r\nAlaskan; I think of the space between letters as if they
    are vessels that could contain water and even though the shapes are different
    between the different letterforms the amount of liquid would be the same or equal.\r\n2.)
    The counter space inside the \"e\" will most likely be problematic when reproducing
    the logo at much smaller size.\r\n\r\n3.) The relationship with the qualifier
    \"bistro\" may also be too small, unbalanced and illegible when reduced, for something
    like a business card or hang tag.\r\n\r\nGreat work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pomegranate_05_6610.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/180px-Pomseeds2_5349.jpg]"
