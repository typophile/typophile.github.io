body: hi, <BR> <BR>just wondering if its appropriate to use a semi-colon to separate
  information on a business card? <BR> <BR>ie. <a href="http://www.mywebsite.com"
  target="_blank">www.mywebsite.com</a>; <a href="mailto:myemail@anisp.com">myemail@anisp.com</a>
  <BR> <BR>if not, any other suggestions for a seperator? <BR> <BR>thanks <BR>iota.

  body: It would be unusual and, I suspect, would be counter to the design intent
    of the typical business card, in which information is visually separated out so
    that it is easily located. Using a semi-colon to separate a URL and an e-mail
    address might, however briefly, make both bits of information less than perfectly
    clear. If you&#39;re looking for an e-mail address on a card, you are unlikely
    to look at the end of what seems to be something else. It would be better to separate
    out the two pieces of information with a healthy space between them, or by putting
    them on separate lines.

  body: I would also try to stay away from using a semi-colon on a buisness card,
    using the space that is available on the card would mean you would not need to
    use any colons. <BR>Using slightly different type weights helps to make a clear
    seperation between two words or addresses such as email address and website address.
