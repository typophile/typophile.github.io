  body: Thank you for your comments, okty, <BR> <BR>You are absolutely correct about
    the <i>S</i>, but, for some reason, I feel motivated to incjude a <i>J</i> whose
    bowl descends below the baseline &#40;similar to some more-traditional faces&#41;.
    You are also correct in suggesting a few words would be more helpful... certainly
    a more accurate assessment of a design

  body: 'Dana, apparently you succeeded in posting, but for some reason I for one
    didn&#39;t get a copy of the original message! <BR> <BR>As you say, this is very
    rough. Which makes it not <i>impossible</i> to evaluate, but requires some assumptions
    on our end of what your <i>intent</i> actually is, I mean [even] at the formal
    level. For example we can only guess whether you intend to make the final result
    smooth or rough, irregular or consistent, etc. <BR> <BR>One thing I would guess
    is that you&#39;re going for Modern &#40;uniform&#41; widths on the caps &#40;as
    opposed to &#34;Classical&#34;&#41;. If this is true, then I would say that the
    &#34;C&#34;, &#34;H&#34;, &#34;L&#34;, &#34;M&#34;, &#34;T&#34; and &#34;Y&#34;
    are too narrow, while &#34;S&#34; is too wide. In the lc, compare the &#34;s&#34;
    and &#34;t&#34;: these are characters that should [generally] be more harmonious
    in widths. <BR> <BR>Trying to figure out what kind of finish &#40;as opposed to
    structure - which you seem to mostly have already&#41; would make this design
    look its best, it seems to me that something with smooth, disciplined, contrasty
    curves -think of Peignot- would give it a character most likely to end up being
    used by numerous people. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'So here are some vector glyphs that represent one small degree of advancement
    beyond the pencil roughs. <BR> <BR>The intent is for a design that could possibly
    be used in packaging or &#40;maybe&#41; in ad work... but I seriously doubt that
    the rather impractical horizontal scale would be appropriate for editorial uses.

  body: Dana, I thing that both of the vertical strokes on the H should have the same
    weight. I also like the &#34;th&#34; ligature in the first post on this thread.
    <BR> <BR>And the name of the font is cool.

    i&#39;ll leave the critique to the experts as i&#39;m not seeing any problems

  body: It&#39;s looking nicer! <BR> <BR>If you keep the weight difference in the
    stems of the &#34;H&#34; &#40;which I might actually suggest you do&#41; I&#39;d
    flip them. The only other thing I&#39;m noticing is that the &#34;a&#34; needs
    a corner of some sort on the bottom-right, to avoid being too much of an &#34;o&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>And it does have a certain Nordic feel to me. <BR> <BR>hhp
