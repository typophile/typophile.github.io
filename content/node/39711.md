  \  \t The New Servitudes\r\nMOLLY SHAFFER VAN HOUWELING\r\nGeorgetown Law Journal,
  Forthcoming\r\n \r\nAbstract:     \r\nIn the age of electronic commerce, consumers
  routinely acquire intangible products without engaging in any direct human interaction.
  These products - computer programs, digital music, etc. - often arrive bearing terms
  that purport to limit the sticks in the consumers' bundles of rights in ways that
  depart from the background limitations imposed by intellectual property law. For
  example, a consumer who has downloaded a computer program from the Internet might
  be presented with a screen of text imposing myriad restrictions on how the program
  may be used; installation commences only when the consumer clicks 'I agree.' Courts
  in the United States have increasingly enforced such restrictions - labeling them
  'click-wrap licenses' and applying to them the same contractual concepts that govern
  face-to-face exchanges of promises. Similar licensing approaches - albeit with quite
  different substantive terms - have been extended into the realms of 'free software'
  and 'free culture.'\r\n\r\nThe law of tangible property offers a different lens
  through which to view these contemporary techniques for distributing and controlling
  intangible products. When someone buys land that is purportedly subject to use restrictions
  imposed by a prior owner, those restrictions are sometimes enforced as 'servitudes'
  - non-possessory property interests that attach to land and impose their restrictions
  and obligations on generation after generation of landowners. Like click-wrap licenses
  and similar techniques of the digital age, use restrictions imposed by servitudes
  bind remote purchasers with whom the beneficiaries of the restrictions may have
  no direct relationship. They do not arise from any human communication, but instead
  'run with' the burdened assets and automatically bind current possessors.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIn
  this article I develop a comprehensive account of the evolving jurisprudence of
  servitudes as applied to both land and personal property, identifying the sources
  of traditional servitude skepticism in order better to evaluate the new generation
  of running restrictions on intangible informational goods...."

  body: Interesting. The software, and fonts, are licensed rather than purchased.
    That is not exactly equivalent to renting property, but is would be a clarification
    within the analogy.

  body: "I don't see \"human communication\" as being relevant to the digital/tangible
    nature of the propertry, it relates more to the means of sale.\r\nYou can by tangible
    property online, books, for instance, from Amazon, with no human communication.\r\nYou
    can even buy groceries that way now, at the supermarket.\r\n\r\nConversely, I
    have been commissioned to create fonts, in very direct relationship with my clients,
    and the fonts have been licensed to them with almost identical terms as for retail
    fonts. (The difference being a period of exclusivity.)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a distributor
    of fonts or stock photography may assist a client/customer in searching for a
    licensed product."
