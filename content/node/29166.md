  don't understand the explanation in the FontLab manual for hinting replacement.\r\n\r\nI
  want to do it manually but (beside of the terrible explanation in the page 681 of
  the manual) I do not find any step by step instruction to solve overlaped hints
  using HR points.\r\nI do not want to use the \"auto HR point placement\" function.
  \r\nCan anybody tells me what is the right sequence to follow?\r\n\r\nOther thing:
  Are \"links\" used in postcript hinting? Or are they only part of TT hinting?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "RamiroE,\r\n\r\nYes, the manual isn't very helpfull and there are not too
    many tutorials around either.\r\n\r\nA good way to learn where to put T1 hints
    and HRs, is to open a T1 font, which has been hinted (not all T1 fonts are hinted,
    or hints are not visible in FL).\r\n\r\nIn general, hints are placed at node extremes
    (inside counters and outside of the outline). Sometimes, as with the 'B', the
    zone (area between hints) overlap. This is indicated in the glyph window by a
    light yellow hatching. The rasterizer, which is part of the glyph renderer of
    an OS, 'walks' around the outline and determines where pixels should be turned
    on. If it arrives at a part of the outline within this overlap zone, it doesn't
    know which hint to apply. It could be the hint from the start of the overlap,
    or the hint at the other end of the overlap. By placing HRs, particular hints
    are applied to a particlar part of the outline. \r\n\r\nThe way to learn is to
    actually hint the B from the manual, making sure the nodes are numbered the same
    way and the direction of the outlines are the same. You can check if the appropriate
    HRs are applied by clicking on an outline, which was in the overlap zone. Only
    the hints that apply are turned green. \r\n\r\nI think that autohinting a T1 font
    isn't bad at all in FL. It has been suggested as the process of choice: first
    authint, then do some tweaks here and there.\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n"
