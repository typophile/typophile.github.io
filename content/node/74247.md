body: "So I can't seem to find what font the artist used on the word \"Sliced\" in
  this image. it's from a shirt on Shirt.Woot from a while ago, but all of my google-fu
  would not help me with identifying what the typeface is. I've tried using font ID
  flowcharts, but no dice.\r\nthe image uploader isn't working, so here's the URL:\r\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/wootsaleimages/Sliced_Breadbz5Detail.png\r\n\r\nnote:
  I don't think the S is part of the typeface, but then again, I've never seen the
  \ typeface, so how would I know...\r\nnote 2: This is for a school project. I need
  the letters e, h, H, i, l, o, r, S, t, y, and ! if possible."

  body: "thanks, man. I with this particular font has italicized letters in addition
    to the regular ones, but Illustrator will have to do that for me...\r\nKnowing
    makes this project SO much easier. I had already started building new letters
    out of the ones from that logo."
