    target="_blank">It&#39;s similar</a> but I don&#39;t think so, Mike. Not that

  body: You&#39;re right. I tried shooting from the hip. My Bad. <BR> <BR>When I looked
    in the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage09.html" target="_blank">
    Sans Serif Font ID Guide</a> I found it was FF Info Text &#40;near the bottom
    of the page&#41;

  body: Oh I don&#39;t think this is Info either. The &#39;l&#39; tails and ear on
    the &#39;g&#39; <BR>are much longer. This is something custom or new. I am not
    <BR>familiar with it.

  body: Never mind! The &#39;y&#39; isn&#39;t right and neither is the &#39;c&#39;.
    I have a sample that shows the curved &#39;l&#39;, but the FontShop site shows
    a straight &#39;l&#39;. I give up &#40;for now&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think you fast
    guys are making me rush. Slo-o-o-w down Mike...

  body: Now this one has me intrigued. The specific &#34;g&#34; shape  <BR>and overall
    design proportions have me believe this is  <BR>a quite recent design. I can&#39;t
    shake the feeling I know it  <BR>&#40;now <i>THAT</i>&#39;s helpful...&#41;.
