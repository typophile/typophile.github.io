  from John Boardley \u2013 the well-known editor of ilovetypography.com, the Codex
  magazine and inventor / originator of lots and lots of other interesting and innovative
  activities in the field of typography. He will edit the paper version of our work
  and write about the typefaces. We hope to publish it with Gestalten.\r\n\r\nWe have
  been working quite hard on it for a year now. Most books have been selected and
  now the captions have to be written. This is my job and this is where this blog
  comes in. I decided to use this medium as a stage for our prepress work. To share
  our work with you and listen to your comments. It is a place to experiment with
  new ways of presenting books. It makes the writing less a lonely pilgrimage and
  more like working in the corner of a coffeeshop or cafe where you can write and
  greet old and new friends.\r\n\r\nI have asked historian and former librarian of
  the British Library dr Jaap Harskamp to join me. He is an expert in 19th century
  cultural history and books and in the modern movement. He will write short essays
  on all kinds of books and edits the rest.\r\n\r\nThe blog will contain more than
  the book: we decided to incorporate books that are famous for their content too
  (Descartes comes to mind, Spinoza). We think that this juxtapose will be very interesting
  indeed.\r\n\r\nPaul Dijstelberge\r\n\r\n- curator at the Amsterdam Special Collections
  and associate professor for the history of the book."
