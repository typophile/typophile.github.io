  body: According to Martin Kotulla, I think SoftMaker is finally creating an all-new
    exclusive typeface design, an actual clone of Doyald Young's best-known script
    typeface (recently released as Home Run Script-roman), which is called "H785 Script"
    (numbered from Homer, featuring both the uppercase and lowercase character sets,
    the same as Home Run Script-roman; however, the numbers look quite original, the
    @/at symbol is not inverted, and that the Euro Symbol and some math symbols look
    different, although the rest of the characters have their glyphs kept intact).   This
    font name is appearing on both the "MegaFont XXL 3.0" and "infiniType 4" premium-quality
    typeface collections from SoftMaker, which were both being released around May
    27, 2014.

    and  <BR>for the most part well done. I&#39;m also a large admirer of Doyald  <BR>Young&#39;s
    work. A few comments: <BR> <BR>1. Overall I think the general swash shapes are
    working,  <BR>Consider adding a second swash element that begins in the loop  <BR>below
    the D, parallels the other, the crosses to curl into the  <BR>white space below
    the ld to improve balance. Make sense? <BR> <BR>2. The D. I&#39;m not fond of
    the top curling in and the bowl curving  <BR>in also. Consider trying the bowl
    crossing over the stem and  <BR>connecting to the stems tail &#40;echoing the
    y&#41;.  <BR> <BR>3. The y is too narrow and poorly spaced between the o and a.  <BR>&#40;tough
    to kern a pencil drawing -- exacto!&#41;. Not sure the ball  <BR>terminal fits.
    Nice detail in the slight bulge on the right side. <BR> <BR>4. The modulation
    in the l is uncertain. Actually, the modulation  <BR>in general is a little inconsistent,
    but not incredibly so. It&#39;s the  <BR>danger of drawing a script with a pencil.
    You have to know  <BR>exactly how you&#39;d draw it with a pen or brush. I know
    Young  <BR>uses a pencil for his scripts, as did Benguiat when he drew  <BR>Edwardian
    Script. I don&#39;t have this expertise, but something  <BR>seems off. Try to
    picture the draw of the nib as you apply  <BR>pressure down and release going
    up, and the angle that your  <BR>wrist can feasibly make, will it take one or
    two strokes etc... Did  <BR>you have a model you were working from? Kinda sounded
    like  <BR>you chose not to. Even if it&#39;s not close look at something to sure  <BR>up
    your modulation.  <BR> <BR>5. Maybe wrap the top of the d a little more to echo
    the swash tail. <BR> <BR>There are some flat curves in here, but that can be remidied.
    <BR>This kind of thing is really tough. I&#39;m impressed. I notice you are  <BR>in
    LA, is this a class for Doyald? Looking forward to seeing the final. <BR> <BR>Randy'

    here are my two bits: <BR> <BR>The first D is sloped too far. It looks to me like
    it&#39;s being forced out of the way by the y&#39;s swashing tail. Which isn&#39;t

  body: Personally, I prefer the second floating swash &#40;if anyone knows a name
    more proper, please inform my ignorance of it&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I was just wondering
    if you couldn&#39;t use the shape of the D from the first picture to drop down
    into that swash. <BR> <BR>However, the first picture does have more focus on the
    word itself. The second one has such a repetition of that curved right line that
    it motivates your eyes into its direction. It reminds me of sound waves. <BR>
    <BR>If you don&#39;t like the effect, try cutting the fat out of the bottom. Those
    swashes are much thicker than the top letterforms. <BR> <BR>Also, the back of
    the &#34;a&#34; should technically be thicker. I believe it would fall on the
    wider angle of the pen, and follow through slightly into the ligature between
    the &#34;l.&#34; I could be mistaken, though. <BR> <BR>Either way, I still prefer
    the extra swash. And I like the extreme thick thin difference.

  body: 'Hi Eric, <BR> <BR>As a matter of personal taste I actually prefer the original
    post. It&#39;s unusual to see a low&#40;er&#41; contrast, formal script. <BR>
    <BR>Looking at formal scripts that include swashes and flourishes, is seems the
    lower case in particular is pretty locked in it&#39;s modulation axis. The caps
    have a bit more variation as needed, and the flourishes often vary considerably.
    <BR> <BR>For example in your 11/7 2:59 post, the flourishes seem to follow the
    axis of the roman too much yielding too much up and down motion. The original
    brings more horizontal push which is nice. Also in this example, the one-sided
    a and one-sided l look week in combination. <BR> <BR>Basically, I&#39;d go back
    to your original drawing, and focus on: <BR>1. Getting the D to feel comfortable.
    <BR>2. The y wider, as in later versions, but make sure the right is thin &#40;!&#41;
    swelling smoothly, but quickly at the end to finish &#40;more like the teardrop,
    just finishing in a point&#41; -- I&#39;d keep it at x-height too&#41;. <BR>3.
    Working on the l. Understanding that the orignal style is quite different that
    what I&#39;m about to point too, I still think this form could work &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/hogarth-script/hogarth-script/testdrive.html?s=Doyald&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Hogarth</a>&#41;. Note how it doesn&#39;t actually connect as
    yours does, it begins higher. <BR> <BR>One other note, I think generally, the
    thicks in your flourishes should be slightly thinner than the thicks in the text.
    Put the emphasis on the word. See Bickham for example. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I agree
    that the second flourish is a little busy. Keep pushing! I applaud you for sticking
    to a pencil and your brain. It lets an idea remain an idea and not straight jacket
    you into a bad idea because it looks &#34;final.&#34; <BR> <BR>R'

  body: 'Eric <BR> <BR>The D in the 8:31 post looks much more dignified now. <BR>
    <BR>Hrant is right about the &#39;a&#39; and &#39;o&#39; becoming too similar.
    However, I think flattening &#40;or cutting diagonal&#41; the top of the a&#39;s
    stem while bringing the point slightly closer would fix it. I&#39;m looking at
    your first drawing which doesn&#39;t seem to have the problem. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure why Randy doesn&#39;t like the &#39;y&#39; going above x-height. It increases
    the y&#39;s character, in my opinion. I&#39;d even suggest raising the left side
    too. But you do need to carry a thicker stroke out of the arm of the &#39;y&#39;
    so the left side arm runs into the right side. <BR> <BR>I like Randy&#39;s suggestion
    for the &#39;l.&#39; It does look more standard than the other letters. <BR> <BR>As
    for the 8:42 post: the D is so much more original to me. I was thinking that besides
    straightening the stem, the first D would do better to not have the top wrap in
    on itself. I know everything else is more round, but it becomes much more recognizable
    if the top of the D goes back straighter, with only a slight curve. <BR> <BR>The
    D is definitely worth another try or two. <BR> <BR>My preference is still for
    the second flourish and the 8:42 post is intriguing to me. That post is also a
    good reminder of why kerning is so important with scripts. It reminds me of the
    <b>Walg reens</b> I have to pass everyday on my route to work. But that&#39;s
    for the Critique Board. <BR> <BR>Well, we&#39;re coming at you from all angles
    here. I&#39;d be more willing to give up the second flourish if the original D,
    with changes, slipped back into the picture. To my eyes, with the work you&#39;re
    basing this off of, the thins increase Doyald&#39;s elegance.'

    I preferred the original D, with 2 seperate strokes, and I like having more of

    extends past the lc &#34;d&#34; <BR> <BR>I think the y is improved; the angle
    is more consistent with the other letters and the right arm transitions better
    into the flourish. <BR> <BR>The a is pretty good, looks much more like an a than
    an o, and the weight on the right side is more consistent with the d. <BR> <BR>Not
    sure about the l. I tried to straighten the left stroke and bulge out the right
    one. I liked that about the Hobart l. I think the bulge on the right size echoes
    the ascender of the d as well. I still wanted the l to connect to the a, though.

    <BR>The real problem is that &#39;l.&#39; The thick side needs to curve more.
    It&#39;s too straight compared to the &#39;d&#39; and the flourishes. <BR> <BR>That

    Roundhand</a> by Mr. Snell and Mr. Carter. <BR> <BR>Of course, that&#39;s not
    the best example for this script, but if the &#39;l&#39; became just a simple

    left side of the &#39;d&#39; is too thick and the right side is too thin. Notice
    the where the &#39;l&#39; &#40;very nice&#41; begins to fatten up, that&#39;s
    more of how the &#39;d&#39; should go. The &#39;a&#39;s backside does this excellently.
    <BR> <BR>The flourish is once again thicker then the &#39;d&#39; which also causes
    problems. <BR> <BR>The &#39;D&#39; looks even better, except the slope of the
    stem is a little too far right. <BR> <BR>Now that I look at it, the left side
    of the &#39;o&#39; is also a little too fat and the right side could curve a bit
    more. <BR> <BR>Keep tweaking; it&#39;s getting there stone by stone.

  body: I think it&#39;s bothering you because it&#39;s dynamic, not a formal script.
    You might actually try the &#34;if you love it set it free&#34; approach, where
    you relish its human complexity instead of trying to make it &#34;perfect&#34;.

  body: I think that the way the two arms of the y connect to form the tail in your
    vector drawing is a bit uncomfortable, but I can&#39;t give any good advice about
    how to fix it. <BR> <BR>This is really beautiful.  <BR> <BR>I have to second the
    comment that was made about the stroke contrast in the later versions vs. the
    first version. I really like those strokes better, because of the less contrast.
    That isn&#39;t as common, and I find it very interesting to look at. I can&#39;t
    ponder your newer ones as much, but as I said, they are still stunning. Best of
    luck finishing this, I hope that you&#39;ll love it as much as we do!
