body: Well. Sadly I&#39;ve been asked to use Quark for this book project I just recieved.
  &#42;sigh&#42; I&#39;m trying to remember how to get the program to use typographer&#39;s
  quotes. I have found the preference, and I&#39;ve changed that. But, when I&#39;m
  placing .txt files &#40;converted from .doc files&#41; it imports as happy inch
  and foot marks. Does it not see my preference. Help? Pretty please.

  body: There&#39;s a couple ways to fix that, import the .doc files, or just do a
    find <b>&#34;</b> and replace with <b>&#34;</b>. It will automatically convert
    all the quotes to curly quotes. You can do the same with apostrophes.

  body: If you&#39;re trying to maintain tagged text, then it has to be imported as
    a plain text file. You can import a MSWord doc if you have the proper translation
    XTension. <BR> <BR>Either way, when you select File &#62; Get Text..., make sure
    you check the box in the lower lefthand corner of the navigation dialog box that
    says &#34;Convert Quotes&#34; before clicking Okay. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: Thank Kent. I know that others will continue to use Quark. I know I can count
    on that. In some way I feel like I&#39;m home again, in some way I feel like I&#39;ve
    taken a few steps back. <BR> <BR>On that note. If anyone has any favorite typesetting
    tips-n-tricks for quark, I&#39;d love those also. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: You&#39;re funny J-F P. While I don&#39;t doubt that InDesign is a better
    program, I am not enjoying the transition. I am finding it a struggle and quite
    uncomfortable. While Quark has its faults, they are familiar faults. I have been
    using Quark for about 12 years and it is now like breathing for me. Quark may
    not set great type right out of the box, but over the years I&#39;ve developed
    an arsenal of tricks and custom shortcuts that allow me to quickly coax perfectly
    fine typography. And those skills are now honed to production speeds. <BR> <BR>InDesign
    is going to set me back probably several months in terms of production. By which
    I mean that it will probably take me quite a while to get as fluent in InDesign
    as I am in Quark, to the point that I can be as productive as I am now. Ain&#39;t
    switching great :-/ <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m pissed that Quark
    has turned its back on typographers by ignoring Unicode and OpenType. I used to
    appreciate the fact that Quark wasn&#39;t always upgrading and changing things
    on me every few months. But I hate them for these last non-upgrades. However,
    that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m running to embrace the AdobeSoft monopoly either.
    <BR> <BR>Tiffany -- My favorite trick, and I don&#39;t think a lot of people know
    this, so just between you and me... if you load the free <a href="http://www.quark.com/service/desktop/downloads/details.jsp?idx=437"
    target="_blank"> TypeTricks</a> XTension, then you can use the keyboard to track
    just the &#42;word spacing&#42; in a selection. This allows me to fine tune justification
    by loosening or tightening just the word spaces -- just like the old-timers used
    to do to justify handset metal lines, leave the letterspacing alone. This trick
    has been essential for me in getting control of fine spacing. <BR> <BR>I have
    yet to figure out how you can get this kind of control in InD. If anyone knows
    how to track just the word spacing in InD, please let me know. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

    should be something similiar.  <BR>At least on my system this shortcut doesn&#39;t
    slow down the program...:-&#41; <BR> <BR>And Kent -- the switcheroo from QXP to
    ID shouldn&#39;t take you months, first because ID offers you the same keyboard
    shortcuts, if you want them &#40;although I used the chance to come up with my
    own, which are in tune with FH and Photoshop&#41;. It took me about a week to
    switch, and during that I worked on projects with the software, so I had no formal
    training time at all. Having worked with Quark and Pagemaker before, it was rather
    like switching from a Beetle to a Beemer. And after you made the switch, the extended
    possibilities and flexibility in your work, as well as the higher efficiency in
    everyday work should save you LOTS of time. I know that I can do a 200&#43;-pages
    book in less than a day &#40;if need be&#41;, whereas with Quark it was always
    a matter of several days.  <BR>Switching, in this case, is great indeed.  <BR>
    <BR>You&#39;ll find that most of your tricks and custom shortcuts will also work
    in ID and -- with the right basic configuration -- won&#39;t be needed at all.
    ID plus Pro-OpenType-Fonts makes good typography almost too easy :-D. '

  body: 'Kent, I am just learning InDesign. I am not sure that this is what you want,
    but When you set up or modify paragraph styles, there is a tab that gives you
    a dialogue box for justification. It enables you to choose minimum, desired, and
    maximum settings for word and letter spacing and glyph scaling. The book &#39;Complete
    Manual of Typography&#39; by Felici has nice examples of using these controls
    in his chapter on H &amp; J. This is what sold me on upgrading from PageMaker. '

  body: 'Pongo -- thanks for the tip. I&#39;ll have to try that out and see if it
    behaves the way I want. I realize part of my problem is that the manual I have
    is for version 1, and it seems like some subtle, but important, key combinations
    and things have changed. But this is one that wasn&#39;t mentioned at all. <BR>
    <BR>HD -- Thanks for the pep talk. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get the hang of this
    in time, but I dislike learning curves. Those who know me can tell you: I&#39;m
    usually a very quick study and quite good at picking up new skills. That&#39;s
    why I&#39;m so surprised at how frustrating this transition is for me. i would
    have thought it would be completely smooth. But for some reason, that is just
    not the case here. It doesn&#39;t help that I have a lot of deadlines and just
    don&#39;t have the luxury to play around and learn; I need to get the designs
    built and on their way. So I usually just resort to launching Quark and going
    with the good ol&#39; familiar. <BR> <BR>William -- What you&#39;re describing
    is not what I was asking about. H&amp;Js are old hat. But thanks anyway.  <BR>
    <BR>What I&#39;m talking about is basically like tracking, but tracking that only
    acts on the word spaces. Many designers I have worked with are tempted to track
    the entire line when trying to manually finetune justification. However, because
    this works on letterspacing as well as word spacing, wholesale tracking distorts
    word shapes, especially when used in extremes. Pre-digital justification usually
    focused on adjusting only word spaces. That&#39;s the way I prefer to do it. <BR>
    <BR>InDesign&#39;s multi-line algorithm does indeed make better justification
    and hyphenation decisions. And the controls are finer. But there are still places
    where I want to make a different decision from the program. It&#39;s only a computer,
    whereas I am a typographer and a reader. When that&#39;s the case I want to be
    able to manipulate those word spaces directly &#40;short of manually kerning each
    one -- that&#39;s too tedious even for me!&#41; <BR> <BR>I do appreciate Indy&#39;s
    access to finetuning the balance of strikes for hyphenation versus justification.
    I wish, however, that it allowed me to actually interact directly with each variable,
    instead of that simplified &#34;better spacing&#34; slider. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: '&#62; Kent, what intrigued me about Felici&#39;s discussion of H &amp; J
    is that he argues - with examples - that using a mixture of word and letter spacing
    &#42;and&#42; slight stretching or compression of glyphs that the result is better
    than any of the above alone. If you or others have seen his argument and examples,
    I be interested in your view of it. '

    -- <BR> <BR>A computerized justification routine works essentially by assigning
    a certain number of penalty points to each variable -- hyphenation, word space
    adjustment, and letter space adjustment. The program calculates every hyphenation
    and spacing possibility, applies the various penalties, adds up the scores, and
    selects the variation with the lowest score. Obviously, how the different variables
    are weighted will influence the decisions that are made. If hyphenation is given
    a higher penalty, then the program will seek to adjust spacing first; if spacing
    is given a higher penalty, then hyphenation will be the first line of attack.   <BR>
    <BR>In PM and Quark, the typesetter must accept the scoring scheme that the programmers
    decided. InDesign gives us arms-length access to these values through the slider
    in the Hyphenation dialog box. You can adjust the interaction between &#34;better
    spacing&#34; and &#34;fewer hyphens.&#34; This is a great advancement.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    greedy, however; I would like direct access to the variables. Yes, generally speaking,
    hyphenation and spacing are a direct trade-off, and the slider represents that
    graphically. But if the routine is sophisticated, I expect that it&#39;s not just
    a matter of two interdependent variables. For instance, it might be possible to
    apply a lesser penalty to 5-letter hyphenation and a greater penalty to 2-letter
    hyphenation, so that the routine would generally favor hyphenation &#40;and thus
    better spacing&#41; but only use 2-letter hyphenation &#42;after&#42; all spacing
    adjustment was exhausted. <BR> <BR>With due respect to the InDesign programmers,
    what&#39;s going on behind that slider does seem to be some sophisticated interaction
    with the hyphenation dictionary. I just wish I could see behind that curtain.
    <BR> <BR>And yes, I would love some cream. Thank you. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>P.S.
    I&#39;ll have to re-read Felici and get back to you. Sorry, not enough time at
    present. <BR>
