  body: I don&#39;t want to sound nitpicky, but that&#39;s not an italic but a slanted
    FF Sari. <BR> <BR>As to how to distinguish Barmeno from FF Sari - basically you
    don&#39;t,  <BR>FF Sari is an improved &#40;in minute details&#41; and expanded
    Barmeno. <BR>The major difference is that you support Hans Reichel by purchasing  <BR>FF
    Sari, while it will be <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html" target="_blank">
    a little harder to face yourself in the mirror</a> after  <BR>buying Barmeno.

  body: 'Whoa! I did not realize Berthold were that persistant in their hunting. Even
    though I too had them on my back for a short while:  <BR>Trying to convert a Berthold
    Mac type 1 font to use on a windows computer I asked on the forum  &#40;might
    have been a stupid thing to do&#41; how to do this properly. Berthold Tech immediately
    sendt me an email explaining that this was illegal and I was warned about this.
    So I didn&#39;t convert the thing. But soon after recieving the Berthold email
    I recieved an email which I assume also was from Berthold and a trap. It went
    something like this: <BR>------------------------- <BR>Heloooo I see you is seek
    on advice to converting of the font. This is easy thing. I help you. Send me email
    and I help faster. <BR> <BR>Binghur Sadhivaaatda &#40;Or something similar.&#41;
    <BR>------------------------- <BR>Sadly I have deleted the phony email. It was
    kind of funny.   <BR> <BR>Maybe I was just being paranoid and that last email
    wasn&#39;t from berthold at all but still I found it strange. <BR> <BR>Anyways.
    Thanks for the link, Yves.  <BR> <BR>MG <BR> <BR>ps: please delete this post if
    it breakes any ethic rules of the forum.'

  body: Yves, I don&#39;t want to be picky either, but in the interests of strict
    accuracy that is a slanted <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/zzz_detail.html?sku=BQ90042001P1"
    target="_blank">Barmeno</a>, not <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/zzz_detail.html?sku=FF01109701P2"
    target="_blank">Sari</a>. The one rather clear distinction between those two fonts
    is that Barmeno has a straight-sided M &#40;like the sample&#41;. The M in FF
    Sari has legs that are splayed.  Sari does have an &#39;italic&#39; according
    to the FontFont catalog, and Barmeno does not, so that is the other main difference
    I am aware of.

  body: Yves, it&#39;s so rare to catch you on even a little mistake, that I had to
    look twice to convince myself. <BR> <BR>After reading &#40;again&#41; the Berthold/Hunt
    story on Luc&#39;s pages, I really didn&#39;t want to plug their font, but we
    try to be accurate here, right? BTW, as you could see from my links, contrary
    to Luc&#39;s article, there is at least one other site &#40;Phil&#39;s&#41; that
    sells their fonts, although the pricing is identical, right down to the Packages
    which cannot be broken for individual font sales. <BR> <BR>Objectivity first,
    then Subjectivity, even though it&#39;s a hard rule to follow.

  body: Thanks to Mike for pointing out an actual difference between Barmeno and Sari.
    I had looked for differences &#40;apparently not carefully enough&#41; and didn&#39;t
    find any, hence my question. I also figured there was a back story given that
    Reichel published an &#40;almost&#41; identical font with a different foundry.
    And indeed there is a back story!

  body: The main reason I knew about the M is that it is one of the 7 key letters
    in my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html" target="_blank">Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide</a>. The two characteristics I note are whether the legs are
    vertical or splayed, and whether the crotch &#40;vertex&#41; of the M reaches
    the baseline or not. This gives four possible M variations.   <BR> <BR>Another
    difference is that the tail on the R is very slightly curved in Sari, while it
    is completely straight in Barmeno. The R is another of my key letters, with four
    variations based on the position and shape of the tail. <BR> <BR>So Barmeno has  Style
    Codes of 31/37, while Sari is classified as either 31/38, or 31/62, based on whether
    you take the slight curve into account or not.  <BR> <BR>Pardon me for dwelling
    on this, as I realize I may be the only one who cares about how I classify Sans
    Serif fonts.
