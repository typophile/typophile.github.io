  rid of all bezier curve in every single letter and turn them into something similar
  as the image I've uploaded. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a97_4018_3615.jpg]\r\nDo
  you know how to do it in any font software? \r\nI have access to FontForge and Glyphs.
  But if you know how to do it in Font Lab or any other software I would be happy
  to know how.\r\n\r\nAny help is very much appreciated :)\r\nThank you\r\n"

    Studio, and import it in Glyphs, you\u2019ll get something like this. I don\u2019t
    know how to build Glyphs-files in FontForge, but I\u2019d be happy to help you
    out."
