  body: "<a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/atlantik\">This</a> instantly
    makes me think of the north. Hardanger (specifically \u201Cstavkirker\u201D and
    wood carving) should definitely get some attention among typophiles, but given
    the destination being somewhat broader it might not be perfect for this project.
    Something along the lines of those quircky old DIN like straight-sided grotesques
    that are used in a lot of city signage all over Scandinavia might be something
    to look in to."

  body: Telefon is drawn by a norwegian, based on the letterforms of Televerkets phone
    booths which almost every habitable place in Norway have had or still has. The
    title of this thread is all about Norway, but the title post is more general.
    Care to elaborate?

  body: "Frank, I don't think all the facts you quote from the thread wormwood pointed
    to will make the font look \"Norwegian\" to customers of a travel agency. People
    planning their first holiday in Norway will not say \"hey, that looks like the
    writing on Norwegian phone booths\" ;-)\r\nThat's one thine often overlooked when
    someone asks for a theme font: Most people looking at printed paper don't immediately
    associate the nationality of the font designer. The more the typeface business
    becomes international, the less a particular font has a local flavour. Maybe we
    have to get used to it that not every idea or feeling can be conveyed by a font. "

    mistake. And it has other sources of inspiration than the phone booths, old Norwegian
    street signs and handpainted signs are just as important. My typeface in the works
    looks distinctly Norwegian to me, but that''s not very important: I''m just a
    beginner trying to learn the craft of type design. By the way, it''s much more
    inspired by Jakob Erbar''s types than Paul Renner''s.  '

    for real or are you just being a troll? Either way your remark about Telefon suggests
    you have an undiscerning eye. And so, also considering that your first post on
    this thread was, presumably, a joke and your website is such an eyesore from 1994,
    I can't be bothered to reply with rational argument.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Rather weird
    combination of geometric and humanist sans characteristics.\"</em>\r\n\r\nSounds
    ideal to encompass the gothic, constructivist and humanist sans traditions of
    the Northern hemisphere, including Norway, Scotland, Russia, Finland, and Canada,
    as was requested."
