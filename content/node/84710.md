  started as a tailored version of [[http://www.type-together.com/Crete|Crete]], created
  specially to serve as corporate typeface for the upcoming type design competition
  Letter.2. It has been added later and is more independent from the original styles
  with changed terminals and serifs to create two new fonts that deliver a more contemporary
  and functional appearance. Furthermore, the new styles proved to be surprisingly
  efficient for web use. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying Italics have several different lettershapes
  and therefore have, in some cases, their own widths. However, they sit comfortably
  next to the uprights. The names refer to the change in serif weight instead of increasing
  vertical stem widths. \r\n\r\nAfter being available only as webfont, Crete Round
  is now obtainable in our webshop. \r\n<strong>For a limited time, we offer a 25%
  discount on the Crete Round bundle (USE CODE 99d11132 DURING CHECKOUT).</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nmore
