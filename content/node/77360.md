  <cite>The Crystal Goblet</cite> for a French publisher, and there's a rather obscure
  point which I\u2019d like to have your cooperation about. At some point, Mrs. Warde
  alludes to \u201Ca virago with a hatchet\u201D which was supposed to be a fierce
  enemy of wine (if I\u2019m not mistaken) \u2014 does someone know what all this
  is about ?\r\nThank you very much"
