body: I've heard a little about VOLT (OT?) programming of Hebrew fonts, and am wonder
  what the specifics are of this. Is it character substitution for nikkud and regular
  glyphs to use specially designed glyphs with nikkud applied carefully rather than
  arbitrarily?

  body: "If I understand you correctly then yes.\r\n\r\nAs far as substitutions are
    concerned there are many characters that are composites which can be designed
    'carefully' as you say. For instance, if the text file contains a shin followed
    by a shindot then substitute the single character shinwithshindot. This also applies
    to all the characters that take a dagesh and to final characters such as kafsofitwithsheva
    can be displayed with the nikkud up higher.\r\nThat would be a good start.\r\n\r\nYou
    may want to make the advance larger for narrow characters such as yod and vav
    when the nikkud take a lot of space, for instance hatafs and qubuts. Do these
    cases actually occur? I don't concern myself with the correctness of the Hebrew
    text (grammatically) - I display or print whatever the 'user' gives me.  Note
    however that others on this site disagree with this approach.\r\n\r\nYou may want
    to divide the letters into groups depending on width and then position the nikkud
    in the center of the letter depending on width.\r\n\r\nIf you decide now you are
    aiming at the secular market, you will save yourself a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    are aiming at the secular market, you will save yourself a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nDo
    you mean that this would be unnecessary for secular use? This would be what I
    had thought.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be releasing Neuton as a webfont. Including unnecessary
    combination glyphs would bloat the file and increase download size. I was mainly
    curious as to what exactly is done and why.\r\n\r\nI haven't made any nikkud or
    other satellites for Hebrew, which I think have negative widths. So I'm going
    to be figuring that one out."

  body: "Brian,\r\n   \r\n> If you decide now you are aiming at the secular market,
    you will save yourself a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nLet me clarify this a little.  Most
    modern Hebrew uses nikud rather sparingly. The  main use is to make clear the
    meaning of words that would otherwise be ambiguous.\r\nAnother use is to make
    clear the pronunciation of foreign words. \r\nI think you can assume there would
    only be a single nikud above or below a letter. \r\nNikud are also used in children's
    books but well known fonts would be chosen for this.\r\nReligious books may require
    cantillation marks and getting that right is for specialists and masochists (!)\r\nI
    would suggest you include all the combination glyphs in the Unicode as Hebrew
    is not a big font. Get your Hebrew to display well under True Type and Windows
    as Microsoft have done a passably good job to make this work without any special
    effort from you.\r\n\r\nLater use Open Type to polish the font. For instance,
    resh with hirik looks better with the hirik directly under the leg of the resh.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, Mike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    :) I had noted that that there are other glyphs (i.e. with Microsoft typography),
    and that man Pro fonts came with some extras. Even the Culmus opensource fonts
    seem to support everything and then some. But I deduced that it must not be totally
    required, as the Unicode page for Hebrew only has what appears to be required
    in Hebrew."
