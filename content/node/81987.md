body: Got myself a set of Speedball pens to practice calligraphy, to get a better
  idea of the anatomy of letters. The round nib is largely agreeable, the pointed
  nib gets spent too quickly and the broad nib spills ink everywhere. The instruction
  says I can adjust the brass bit to fix that, but there does not seem to be any way
  to move it. What am I doing wrong?

    broad nib fountain pens (do those even exist?).

    using the dropper in the ink bottle to fill the nib reservoir was preferred to
    dipping the point directly into the ink...

    also. Heating the pen point slightly with a match and dipping into the ink removes

    these with something like windex. Higgins Eternal is considered a good quality
    ink to start with. Load the nib with an old brush rather than dipping so you start
    out clean at the tip. \r\n\r\nA better forum for this is: http://www.calligraph.com/cyberscribes/\r\n\r\nIf
    you want o try a pain free fountain pen the Parallel Pen is a no fuss solution.
    I'd recommend the 3.6 mm.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/8\r\n\r\nIf

  body: "The speedball reservoir needs to be altered. The old stock ones are a bit
    domed, the new ones are very flat against the nib which is annoying. If you take
    a tweezer and bend the reservoir so it curls up convexly so that the tip is still
    touching the nib but the center is away from it by a little bit you'll have an
    easy time with that nib. I start beginners with Brause or Tape nibs since they
    are good out off the shelf without fussing. You do have to remove the machine
    oil they are coated with to keep them from rusting or the ink will fall out too
    fast. Also, write on a sloped table or ink will flow too quickly. If you must
    write on a flat table remove the reservoir completely and carefully with a needlenose
    pliers and add some black gouache to your ink to thicken it up so if flows more
    slowly. Good luck.\r\n"
