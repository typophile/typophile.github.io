  concern is; every time I show\r\nsomeone the logo, they start reading it. While
  that's a logical approach, the logo was intended to\r\nbe a form, a hieroglyphic
  kind of stamp. Maybe it's my fault for trying to be legible & abstract at\r\nthe
  same time... although I'm not that far away from the answer :)\r\nThe way the setup
  works now is by merging the 'K' & 'E' into the 'O'; \r\nbecause of the letter width
  compared to the 'I'.\r\nAh yes before I forget, it should read out 'op de koffie',
  but placing the 'op de' above the 'koffie'\r\ndidn't work out composition wise.
  Last problem that I'm aware of is the first 'F' being read as \r\nan 'E'.\r\n\r\nSo
  if there are any ideas floating around be sure to send them this way :)\r\nThanks
  in advance, Matt\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=30ddpox\" target=\"_blank\"><img

  body: "It would invite reading a lot less if the /K/ was much less traditional and
    more abstracted.\r\n\r\nI like this idea, but I think it needs a lot of refinement
    to achieve what you are proposing. I think having the full name aside from the
    (more abstracted) mark would be a reasonable solution.\r\n\r\np.s. funny and perhaps
