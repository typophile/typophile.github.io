body: "Hi, I'm looking for this really really old typeface (DREAMLAND THEATER). It
  may very well be custom/handlettered and non-existent now. My company is designing
  an identity package for them (post-renovations), and they want something that kind
  of throws back to this, but not a copy. Currently, I'm using Fairplex Wide in my
  sketches. I would appreciate any suggestions as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SC394_5382.jpg]"

  body: Of course it was hand lettered. The irregularity of the repeated letters shows
    that. The charm of the sign is in the uneven spacing and stroke modulations. I
    don't have any face suggestions other than reviewing older type catalogs and seriously
    considering drawing your own version. The films are circa 1945. Bon chance.

  body: "@ Charles\r\nI Assumed it probably was handlettered. Unfortunately, the time
    table doesn't allow me to redesign it. I guess I should have emphasized the \"updated\"
    part more. The part i love most is the All talking, All singing, All dancing.
    We're going to try to convince them to keep it on the marquee. The photograph
    itself was dated circa 1940-44, so i guess the movies back that up!\r\n\r\n@Simon\r\nThose
    are indeed some great retro fonts. Thanks!\r\n\r\nI commented on the other thread
    about Letterfonts, but any more suggestions would be appreciated."

  body: "By the way, Letterhead Fonts no longer requires a special installer and all
    that junk\u2014they scrapped that idea. But, there are two things Chuck does differently
    than most. One, they embed your name in the font so it can be tracked; and two,
    you need to convert their fonts to outlines before you send them off into the
    wilderness so they cannot be extracted from a pdf or otherwise pirated. Since
    most of their fonts are for display, I don't see this as a huge hurdle, and if
    it keeps a small, wonderful foundry going, then so be it. Chuck, the proprietor,
    is a great guy and offers fantastic support. I think that it's been very heartbreaking
    for him to see his fonts pirated all over the place. So I would say, don't be
    wary of using Letterhead Fonts. "
