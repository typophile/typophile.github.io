body: Hi guys. I'm hoping someone can help me find a font that closely resembles this
  one from the Jungle Book. Even if it isn't exact. If you can suggest something that
  comes close I will be eternally grateful. Thanks so much in advance!!!

    stills from the title credits</a> \r\nIn 1967, when this movie was released, the
    fine art of hand lettering for movie titles was still alive -- and entirely within
    the ambit of an animation studio like Disney.\r\nThe shoulder on the leg of the
    R reminds me of Tiffany Heavy.\r\nPerhaps someone recognizes the titles as a font?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: These credits are definitely hand-lettered. My font <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/schizotype/eroika-slab/black/">Eroika
    Slab</a> was inspired by them (loosely, and only the black weight) so that might
    be a good match for the feel of them.
