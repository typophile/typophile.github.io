  or change;\r\nI used Lobster to \"soften\" the sharpness of the page, but it looks
  out of place, and I'm not sure if the body font (Hattori Hanzo) is also a good choice
  here.\r\nI am trying to achieve an \"artsy\" look, It is suppose to be a part of
  a photography portfolio, and I don't want the hexagon and square shapes to make
  the page too \"robotic\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/typo_1.png\"></img>"

    also rather mannered = artsy.\r\n\r\nFor the text, I'll have to think about it...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Both of these fine faces are so tightly spaced I would not use them in the
    varying conditions of the web. Unless of course you think it looks cool this way...
    tight, italic, white on black, sans, longlined and small.

    that body type a roman and all is well.\r\n\r\nAnd the linespacing should be a
    bit more."

    When some kind of distinction is needed, variation is what one wants \u2014 wide
    vs condensed, for instance."

    out.\r\nBTW why is it a rule not to use italic in a body, does it make it less
    readable?"

  body: "Welcome to our planet. It's small and monochrome, and you can't leave.\r\n\r\nThe
    way Italics are traditionally made (steep slant, narrow, cursive, no serifs) causes
    them to be bad for continuous reading. That said I believe it's possible to make
    an Italic in a certain way so that it's more readable than most Roman fonts tend
    to be. The thing is if the Italic has too much of a Roman's good attributes it
    stops doing its main job well enough, since as a rule an Italic is designed to
    serve its Roman, and that town ain't big enough for both to be highly readable.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    has a great Roman too, and renders very well onscreen. Plus it breaks from the
    dead old model for making an Italic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
