body: "This is my problem:\r\n\r\nI've delivered to typefaces to the customer, who
  is using it in a Flash computer game. The problem is that when rendering the dynamic
  text in Flash, words containing the letters \xC6, \xD8, \xC5, \xE6, \xF8, \xE5 only
  renders these letters and the rest of the word is missing. \r\nThe weird part is
  that it only happens with one of the two typefaces - they say it must be something
  with the typeface, but I've got no idea of to what could be the cause for this...
  Anyone?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It might be A: The fonts are missing the said letters. B: Dynamic text areas
    in Flash relies on embedding the font (unless it\u2019s available on the end user\u2019s
    computer), which by default is just a subset of the font file to save space. Check
    \"character embedding\" on the \"properties\" panel (with said text area selected).
    \r\n\r\nEdit: Oopps, misread your post, but the embedding part might still apply."

    weird that the word \"\xC5land\" renders just \"\xC5\" or \"Syd\xF8erne\" just
    \"\xF8\"..."
