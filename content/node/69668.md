body: "I just downloaded and installed the latest versions of Cygwin and FontForge.
  I also set the PATH environment variable. Then I tried to run FontForge, but it
  said it couldn't find a file called cygX11-6.dll. Indeed, Cygwin didn't install
  any such file.\r\n\r\nI guess I need an older version of Cygwin.\r\n\r\nDo you know
  how to make it work? Thanks.\r\n\r\n(It's Windows Vista, by the way, but I'd be
  surprised if this had anything to do with that.)"

  body: There is a self-contained version of FontForge that does not require you to
    install previously cygwin or X11 at the url http://www.geocities.jp/meir000/fontforge/
    Just download the .zip file and unzip.
