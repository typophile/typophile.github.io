  my first try on a sans serif non-display-font and I would like to know if you like
  it before I go on with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings:\r\n\r\nSteven"

  body: I think this could benefit from loosening up the straight lines and giving
    it some more "flair." It just seems too stiff for a humanist.

  body: "Thanks for your hints Matthew and Conor. I will try what you suggested and
    loose the letters a bit. I have uploaded a new PDF where I changed some letters.
    I think the s isnt drunken anymore. Also I extended the descenders a bit, and
    made some minimal changes on some letters.\r\nI will post a new update when Im
    ready with loosening some letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nbest wishes:\r\n\r\nSteven"

    does show up great at small sizes."

  body: 'I adore what you''re doing here with height; the difference between I and
    l works very well, and the massive x-heights make the dots over i and j seem to
    hover in a way that''s very warm and uplifting. The w is gorgeous, but I guarantee
    you that someone will use it in a typography book as an example of a serifed letter
    in a sans-serif font. '

    E looks more written/rough. Please tell me what you tinhk of it, or how to improve
    it. I am not very glad of it yet, but I have to go to bed now. Its 6 o clock in
    the morning.\r\n\r\nSo: Goodnight! :)\r\n\r\nSteven"

  body: "Yum... Slightly splayed. I wonder how it would affect the type when printed
    small. I bet it's going to cause some \"there's something different about this
    sans, but I don't know what it is\" reactions :)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I haven't
    encountered something like this recently, so it's a refreshing direction."

    Space Needle... except in a good way. It's got a very cool Zapf/Chappell vibe
    to it, but it still seems fresh. I can't decide whether I like your old 'E' or
    new 'E' better - they both look great.\r\n\r\nI agree that the kerning needs tweaking,
    but since it's a work in progress, you probably know that already.\r\n\r\nI'm
    looking forward to seeing more.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    you dont want to say that my letters are such amateurish like these are :( \r\n\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nI
    think I will go for the new style. I could try making an other Version later.\r\n\r\nAfter
    you are the second person that mentioned it: No I havent done the kerning yet
    :) the letters were just a early vectorised version of my idea how the letters
    could look. I will take notice on the kerning later when I made the whole alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoodnight
    to you all\r\n\r\nbest wishes: Steven"

    a lot of thought; the changes in line-direction, subtle curves...\r\nDon't have
    real critiques on it, to be honest.\r\n\r\nHope you will post updates once you
    have any. :)"
