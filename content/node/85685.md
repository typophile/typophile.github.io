  business, and my customers are home industry contractors, historic architectural
  preservation, food, wine, coffee, non-profit and other odds & end industries. \r\n\r\nFor
  type, I'm going for a hint of Arts & Craft/Art Nouveau, without going overboard.
  The san serif is custom, and the serif is Mackinac Pro (just put out by P22). I
  like how its ampersand matches the curves of my icon. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think
  of this combination? Is the Mackinac too round for the custom type?\r\n\r\nI'm only
  asking for opinion on the type. The icon is not up for discussion.\r\n\r\nNote:
  PLEASE SCROLL TO COMMENT BELOW FOR TYPE IMAGE."

  body: "The composition is what seems the most distracting to me.  Why are you overlapping
    things?  What is the intended message, impression or meaning behind that?  I am
    afraid it is starting to make your graphic look like clipart or some sort of watermark
    rather than an icon.  I know the symbol is not up for discussion, but you might
    do well to consider some of the technical issues (thin lines vanish at smaller
    sizes, reproduction in more limited colors, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe word Adunate feels
    a bit like a mutant.  There is not enough clarity to why some letters have serifs
    and some don't, for example.  Hope that helps."

    What's your thought specifically of the two fonts together? How do you think Mackinac
    fits with this?\r\n"

  body: "So here's a revision on the san serif. (once again, can't believe I missed
    that before. Duh! Shows how you can't see things you've been working on too long:-)\r\n\r\nHere's
    my thought process: In my business, I do both design and writing. I unite the
    two elements of visual design for successful communication. My name is Latin for
    unite, as in the joining together of many parts to equal a whole.\r\n\r\nWith
    that thought in mind, what's your thought on the combination of these two types?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-Work_4853.png]"

  body: "Logo design 101: make it simple enough that it will work in just about any
    medium at any size.\r\n\r\nThis is way too complex, and would fall apart under
    the slightest adversity. CMYK for instance.\r\n\r\nEven if you ran three spot
    colors, there would be serious registration problems.\r\n\r\nJust imagine that
    one day you would like to have classy stationery with engraving, foil stamping
    or embossing, with letterpress type.\r\n\r\nDon't design the logo in isolation,
    but in the context of your business card, which is often your first (and most
    lasting) impression.\r\n"

  body: "Everyone, thanks for your thoughts on the icon. However, PLEASE, I'm only
    asking about the two typefaces. The only reason I initially included the icon
    is to show the idea of contrast. \r\n\r\nI also want to convey the idea of contrast
    with type. What do you think of these two together? Working? Not working?\r\n\r\nPlease,
    just critique the TYPE."
