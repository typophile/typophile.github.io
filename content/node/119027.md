  is a tool game developers can use to build games (using Objective-C, for iOS and
  Android).\r\n\r\nThe playful feel of the brand is basically correct, but we'd like
  it to be a touch more professional-looking, and the logotype in particular needs
  work. \r\n\r\nSuggestions of contemporary-looking sans faces with a smidge of playfulness
  about them (not too much; the colors and mascot go a long way) would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
