  Fonts of World War II\" by Walden Fonts. http://www.waldenfont.com/product.asp?productid=16\r\nNow
  this is a real challenge to font detectives. The Walden images show fonts that are
  hauntingly familiar but Walden gives them names that completely different from the
  real ones. For example Dragoo WF matches Metropolis Shaded by W. Schwerdtner for
  Stempel [1932]. See the digital version by Castle Type http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/metropolis-ct/\r\nSo
  is there a font detective who can identify some of the mystery fonts?\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    recognize several others, but that's all I have time for just now.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Jason Castle offers his take on Ashley Crawford and calls it Xavier."

  body: Now that I have the time, I'll back up and give attribution to the fonts in
    my first post. Ashley Crawford was designed by Ashley Havinden, 1930. Cartoon
    by Howard Trafton, 1936 (available legitimately - but only bundled with software
    - as Corel's Cancun. Lots of knockoffs exist). Nubian by Howard Sniffin, ATF,
    1928.

    - bear with me-  is very similar to Nick Curtis's digitization of (again from
    a Nick Curtis ReadMe file) a typeface shown in a Dover clipart book called Art
    Deco Initials. Apparently , the editor presented an extrapolation of several incomplete
    typefaces of the era to show a complete alphabet. Nick's version of that can be
    had as <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/b.htm'
    target='_blank'>Big Apple</a>. Walden's version is slightly different, so perhaps
    the resource was different ... ? I dunno.\r\n\r\nNuisance appears to be a version
    of a face that David Rakowski did an early digitization of as Hartin 2. Prior
    versions included Hartin and <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/rakowski/dr3/davy_f3.htm'
    target='_blank'>Harting</a>. The Solotype Catalogue (prre-digital) gives a showing
    as Ribbonfaced Typewriter. No idea what the original was."
