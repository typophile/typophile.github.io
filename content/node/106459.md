body: I am in the midst of choosing typefaces for a book, and I just need to get out
  of my own head for a bit! The book is a fairly large-format (9x12), with good production
  values. The subject matter is largely historical, with many vintage photographs
  along with a smaller number of new images. There are a few sections of text, along
  with extended captions for all the images. So I want highly legible, not too compressed,
  slight vintage feel, with lots of layout flexibility, and possibly/probably paired
  with Avenir Next (mainly in some maps or other graphics). I keep coming back to
  Sentinel -- a slab serif seems like a good sort of spiritual fit with the subject
  matter, and Sentinel works better for me in text than something like Bodoni Egyptian,
  and looks a little more sober and less trendy than something like Archer. Opinions?

    who ask questions about what a good font is for a project and fail to explain
    what the project is about!\r\n\r\nWhat is your book <em>about</em>?\r\n\r\nThat
    should give us a good start."

  body: "Well, you asked for it! It's a local history book focusing on Gastonia, a
    small town in North Carolina that was the center of the US textile industry until
    the 1980s. The boom years were in the first quarter of the 20th century, but the
    town was quite prosperous into the 1960s. Today, textiles are long gone and the
    town (which is in the orbit of much, much larger Charlotte) is trying to redefine
    itself. The book was commissioned by the chamber of commerce, so there is a definite
    focus on the business community, with the intent to show that there is more to
    the place than just the death of an industry.\r\n\r\nThe content is a couple of
    essays, with around 125 historic images, with as I said above, some contemporary
    photography -- mainly as a \"then and now\" kind of thing. All of the images will
    have captions of 100-150 words. So, typeface-wise, I want something that has a
    bit of a vintage, American feeling without being distracting or calling a lot
    of attention to itself, and is very flexible and capable in terms of layout. There
    will be at least one map, a double spread detail map of the downtown area based
    on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanborn_Maps\">1922 Sanborn Fire Insurance
    map</a>, with thumbnails of some of the still-standing buildings and image locations
    plus abbreviated captions. \r\n\r\nI should also mention that in addition to the
    design and production work on the book, I am also researching and writing it.
    It has been in the works for nearly a year, with a publication date of February
    2014. So I am just all *kinds* of invested in the project!"
