  body: Thanks for that, I was paying too much attention to the tweaked letter &#39;f&#39;
    to even think of Times. I should know better as I&#39;ve just used Hard Times
    for a big project for college. <BR>Deano.

  body: Note, too, that the design of the lc f differs in different versions. The
    one I linked to is Times New Roman Italic. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/italic/testdrive.html?s=fc&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Times Italic</a> doesn&#39;t have the bracket on the upper left
    corner of the cross bar.
