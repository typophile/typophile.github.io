body: Can anyone recognize if this scrolly character comes from an actual typeface?
  I was given it by a publisher to use on the chapter openers of a book, and now,
  close to publication date, they're wondering what it's origin is and no one seems
  to know. We're hoping it might belong to a font...

    this wasn't in the font. Didn't see it in Bickham Script either. Several of the
    newer OpenType fancy script fonts have ornaments, but I can't seem to find a good
    candidate offhand.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    was neither. I'll have to search through the fleurons and see.\r\nThanks though!"
