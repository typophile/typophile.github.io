  letters when designing a typographic logo? - I need to know the basics! <BR> <BR>Or
  is it simply a doing-by-the-eye-issue? <BR> <BR>TIA <BR> <BR>/Henriko

  body: 'Yes it is doing-by-the-eye. However, here is a tip: <BR> <BR>When spacing
    letters it is impossible to space 2 letter incorrectly. It is the 3rd letter that
    will determine good spacing. Work through your word in 3 letter increments covering
    up the other letters. Once done, check the complete word and fine tune. <BR> <BR>eg.
    for the word Aquatoad check Aqu, then qua, uat, ato and so on. <BR> <BR>Oh, and
    pray the word you&#39;re spacing isn&#39;t LJIIWLA <BR>Some words are bound to
    have problems. Time to get creative, make ligatures, shave letters etc. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: Hey Randy, <BR>That was surely a useful tip. I also heard that you could &#34;cheat&#34;
    by using Indesign&#39;s optical text-feature and then export to Illustrator for
    instance. Still I like to do it the oldschool-way ofcourse <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>But do you have visual examples showing the kerning-issues
    between letters? <BR> <BR>Thanks again!

    use optical kerning. It&#39;s good, but not  <BR>good enough. Space it one letter
    at a time in groups of three. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know if you wanted homework :-&#41;
    <BR>Try spacing the word ATLANTA <BR> <BR><!--attachment: ATLANTA-32638.unk*attachment_icon.gif*application/postscript*135.3**ATLANTA%2eeps

    <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t let the letters to overlap, but don&#39;t be afraid to modify
    the  <BR>letters for better fit. You do this all the time with logos. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: henriko <BR> <BR>The last thing I would do if I were making a logotype would
    be to keep it as a typeface and kern it. The sizes at which your logotype will
    be reproduced drastically affect the kerning. You need to do something else Henrik.
    Convert it to outlines, then kern it until you like it. Try making three versions;
    very small, medium and very large. Use those sizes as needed.

  body: He he. <BR> <BR>Frank, agreed. <BR>Henrik. Off to a nice start. &#40;No grades
    handed out here :-&#41; I picked the word ATLANTA because it has combinations
    that need obvious kerning, one real headache, and I was just in Atlanta yesterday.
    <BR> <BR>I might make minor adjustments to things. <BR>1. AT ------TA should have
    the same spacing <BR>2. ATL looks good <BR>3. LA this is the headache. There will
    be a hole here. You can minimize it as you did by shortening the L. I might shave
    a bit more off. It also might suggest a little looser word spacing overall so
    the hole won&#39;t stand out as much. <BR>4. TL vs NT, NT maybe want a bit more
    space than TL because the N is more dense than the L. What you&#39;re trying to
    do is set up a good rythm between light and dark. <BR> <BR>If this was going to
    be a logo, you might look into an LA ligature, maybe a TL ligature, maybe an NT
    ligature. If not you might angle the right ends of the T&#39;s to mirror the new
    L. In other words, make this custom not a stock font. This is Frank&#39;s point,
    and a good one. &#40;That and smaller sizes wants looser spacing&#41;. <BR> <BR>I
    say maybe and might because your eyes and my eyes see differently. You&#39;re
    eyes might want to narrow the arms on the T. That might help. <BR> <BR>Have fun!

    maybe putting the A inside the L would be appropriate.'
