  Are there any alternative ways of doing so? '

  body: "I prefer to use space between paragraphs and no indent at all. Usually, a
    1,5mm to 2,5mm does the job, according to your leading/layout.\r\n\r\nThere is
    also negative indent: the first like begins at the marign and the remaining are
    indented. To get this you apply a left indent to the paragraph (say, 10mm) and
    a negative indent to the first one (-10mm).\r\n\r\nExcept this, I don't see other
    good ways. In onder times there are bullets marking the begin of a paragraph (as
    you may find in some iluminuras and medieval documents). But this is hardly a
    choice for any contemporary text."

  body: You can set the text solid and use the Paragraph symbol. The versions that
    look like a JP ligature or a flipped D are useful for pulling off this quaint
    look, because they don't look like letters, whereas the standard paragraph symbol
    does look like some kind of P.

  body: "Ken, indenting the first line is the traditional way to do this, but not
    the only one. The reason to use an indent is to indicate \"this is a new paragraph\".
    But if you have another graphic resource to do this \u2013as space between paragraphs\u2013
    it's perfectly valid if it fits your layout.\r\n\r\nSpace between paragraphs was
    a difficult thing to use until electronic desktop publishing arrived. Text pages
    were set based on leading grid and everything needed to fit in a multiple of the
    leading \u2013say, 12pt, 24pt, 36pt etc. When there was another graphic element
    to clearly indicate a new paragraph (as a previous subtitle), the indent was not
    necessary.\r\n\r\nNowadays, you don't need to be limited to these grids. You can
    use measures like a 10.25pt type size in a 13.7pt leading without technical problem.
    You can also use space before and after paragraphs and then vertically justify
    the text to always fill the page limits.\r\n\r\nOf course, most of the books still
    use the traditional way \u2013indents and no space between paragraphs. It's more
    easy to do, always work and saves space. But this is a choice, not a rule.\r\n\r\nYou
    can see some great publications using the no-indent-with-space method, as London's
    New Left Review award-winning graphic project. It's especially good in layouts
    with generous margins. The negative indent is good to reference texts, as dictionaries,
    encyclopedias and technical glossaries. The way Nick described is also very interesting.\r\n"

  body: "It really depends on the kind of publication.\r\nIn a book, where the verso
    shines through, you want to stick to your baseline grid, period.* Using arbitrary
    spaces between paragraphs may seem like a good idea in theory, and look good in
    InDesign too, but not once you hold the physical object in your hand and the stuff
    that shines through is shifted all over the place.\r\nAnd I wouldn't even call
    that a limitation. It's being mindful of how the medium behaves, physically. \r\n(*
    Unless of course you break it consciously, there's a reason for it, and you know
    what you're doing.)"

  body: "Nina, I completely agree with you about the verso effect. If the print uses
    thin paper or is over tinted, you must use a grid because variable line position
    will disturb reading.\r\n\r\nWhat I call \"limitation\" is the lack of other layout
    possibilities during pre-DTP times."
