  body: '&#62;Well, it&#39;s probably about time for a full length explication, so
    here goes. The issue is complicated, and I&#39;ll explain the complication before
    outlining my &#39;best practices&#39; recommendation. <BR> <BR><b>[Note that the
    descender values in the hhea table and the OS/2 sTypoDescender field are properly
    expressed as negative integer &#40;presuming the descender goes below the baseline&#41;,
    while the OS/2 usWinDescent value is expressed as a positive integer. For the
    purpose of the discussion below, all values are treated as if they were positive
    integers, since what matters is the sum of the values.]</b> <BR> <BR>Apple originally
    spec&#39;d the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm">hhea
    </a>table as part of the TrueType spec. This includes three values for vertical
    metrics &#40;despite the fact that the full name of the table is &#39;Horizontal
    Header&#39;&#41;: <BR> <BR> - Ascender <BR> - Descender <BR> - LineGap <BR> <BR>Together,
    these values determine the default linespacing in Mac applications that use system
    font metrics. [This is typical of word processing apps, text editors, and other
    apps that that do not , as a default, handle leading independently of font size.
    Page layout apps and other professional graphics software will typically not use
    the font metrics to determine linespacing, but will expect the user to set leading
    values or will calculate &#39;auto&#39; leading as a percentage of the font size.]
    <BR> <BR>When Microsoft licensed TrueType, and began the extensions of the sfnt
    table format that would lead eventually to OpenType, they decided to spec their
    own vertical metrics values in the grab-all <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm">OS/2</a>
    table. One of the reasons for this was the need to be able to create fonts that
    had backwards compatible metrics with existing Windows bitmap fonts. This led
    to the OS/2 table containing two different sets of vertical metrics data: <BR>
    <BR> - sTypoAscender <BR> - sTypoDescender <BR> - sTypoLineGap <BR> <BR>and <BR>
    <BR> - usWinAscent <BR> - usWinDescent <BR> <BR>As originally intended by Microsoft,
    the &#39;Typo&#39; values were intended to be used by apps to calculate default
    linespacing, in exactly the same way as the corresponding hhea table values on
    the Mac. The &#39;usWin&#39; values were intended to define clipping zones for
    the font, and as such were expected to correspond to the actual vertical extremes
    of the tallest and deepest glyphs in a font, to ensure that these would not be
    clipped &#40;i.e. have pixels chopped off on screen&#41;. <BR> <BR>If this intent
    were followed, one could obtain reliable cross-platform default linespacing by
    making the hhea vertical metrics values equal to the corresponding OS/2 &#39;Typo&#39;
    values. <BR> <BR>However, almost every Windows app developer -- including Microsoft&#39;s
    own app teams -- have incorrectly calculated default linespacing based on the
    OS/2 &#39;usWin&#39; values instead of the correct, &#39;Typo&#39; values. It
    seems likely that this is the result of some application developers noting that
    using the &#39;usWin&#39; values ensured that all glyphs in most fonts avoidec
    contact with any glyphs on lines above or below, while this was not always the
    case with the &#39;Typo&#39; values. <BR> <BR>So we&#39;re now in a complicated
    situation in which: <BR> <BR>a&#41; the specification clearly indicates that the
    correct way to produce cross-platform linespacing is to make the OS/2 &#39;Typo&#39;
    and hhea vertical metrics equivalent; <BR> <BR>b&#41; basically all Windows apps
    calculate linespacing incorrectly; <BR> <BR>c&#41; therefore, the only way to
    get reliable cross-platform linespacing is by deliberately ignoring the specification,
    and by making the hhea table values equivalent to the OS/2 &#39;usWin&#39; values.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>One can sidestep the issue by making the sum of the OS/2 &#39;Typo&#39;
    and &#39;usWin&#39; values equivalent, so that all three sets of values produce
    equivalent results. In my experience, this approach -- as outlined below -- will
    produce good results for most text faces and probably the majority of display
    faces. But display faces with abnormally long extenders can be a problem, because
    one must either clip the extenders or set all the values to provide clearance,
    which produces abnormally large linespacing. We hit this issue when we were making
    the AAT version of Zapfino that ships with Mac OS X. <BR> <BR>Leaving aside the
    for-now unsolveable issue of such display faces, here are my recommendations for
    setting the OS/2 and hhea font metrics. <BR> <BR>1. OS/2 usWin values: <BR>These
    should be set to determine the default linespacing, since this is what almost
    all Windows apps will actually use. For most designs, this will also ensure that
    glyphs are not clipped, since default linespacing typically includes enough &#39;leading&#39;
    to provide clearance. If non-clipping is vital, you simply have to ensure that
    these values serve double-duty. If you have no very tall or deep glyphs that you
    want to avoid clipping, a good basic setting for these values will equal the UPM
    value of the font multiplied by 1.20 or 1.25, as this is a reasonable default
    leading. The actual value of the two fields should reflect the design. In Latin
    faces this will typically mean than a larger value is assigned to the usWinAscent
    field, while in some Arabic fonts the values might favour the descender. For the
    purpose of this explanation, let&#39;s assume a Latin text face with typical TT
    UPM of 2048, which we&#39;ll multiply by 1.25 &#40;=2560&#41; and assign like
    this: <BR> <BR> - usWinAscent = 1836 <BR> - usWinDescent = 724 <BR> <BR> <BR>2.
    Os/2 &#39;Typo&#39; values <BR>We want to make the sum of these values equivalent
    to the usWin values, i.e. to add up to 2560. My recommendation here is to make
    the sum of the sTypoAscender and sTypoDescender equal to the font UPM value &#40;2048&#41;,
    and to assign the different between this and 2560 to the sTypoLineGap field. Again
    this should correspond to the design, and you should begin by measuring your typical
    ascender height and descender depth, e.g. measuring the lowercase <i>d</i> and
    <i>p</i>. Then, if the combined height of these is shorter than 2048, add the
    difference in equal amounts to the sTypoAscender and sTypoDescender. So let&#39;s
    assume that the typical height of the ascender in our example font is 1430 and
    the typical descender depth is 550, i.e. a total height of 1980. <BR> <BR> 2048
    - 1930 = 68 and 68 /2 = 34 <BR> <BR>So this gives us  <BR> <BR> - sTypoAscender
    = 1464 <BR> - sTypoDescender = 584 &#40;actually -584&#41; <BR> <BR>and the difference
    between 2048 and the combined usWin values of 2560 gives us <BR> <BR> - sTypoLineGap
    = 512 <BR> <BR> <BR>3. hhea values <BR>Now setting the hhea values and obtaining
    cross-platform linespacing is easy, because you can simply make these values match
    the corresponding OS/2 &#39;Typo&#39; values: <BR> <BR> - Ascender = 1464 <BR>
    - Descender = 584 &#40;actually -584&#41; <BR> - LineGap = 512'

  body: yes, miguel. i made that page. :^P. but at the bottom, John says he would
    report back after ATypI to get us up to date with the latest thinking on the subject.
    Anyone heard from John?
