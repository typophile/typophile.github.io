body: "I'm working on a project right now and the organization's logo is comprised
  of Hoefler Text Reg set in small caps. I'm looking for a nice sans to use in conjunction
  with this. H&FJ recommends Whitney, however, I'm not a fan of Whitney, and would
  like to use something different. Something easily accessible by the organization
  is also a plus. \r\n\r\nThe organization has a safe, yet modern look. They aim to
  appeal to a younger generation, yet convey, trust, assurance, and wisdom. Hoefler
  Text does a good job (in my opinion) of evoking the trust, assurance, and wisdom
  aspects. \r\n\r\nLooking for a nice clean sans that can wrap up the modern, and
  young aspect. Thinking something like Helvetica LT Neue or Avenir LT STD would work
  nicely. Both no frills, clean, almost steril sans-serifs. \r\n\r\nAny further input
  is appreciated, if you've got the perfect sans for Hoefler, I'd love to know. "

    too vintage a look for what you're after. \r\n\r\nHave you tried it with Gotham?
    If it's for extended next, consider using Gotham narrow."

  body: Their website suggests Whitney or Knockout. I don't like using Knockout or
    Champion for copy, though. I'd go with Whitney.

  body: 'Really appreciate the feedback, I ended up playing it safe and going with
    Avenir. Found it to be a great fit, a nice clean, sterile look with just he right
    amount of personality. Not to mention, I have a mancrush on Adrian Frutiger. '
