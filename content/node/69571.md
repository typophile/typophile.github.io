  the Q give me some hard time There may be other letters that would need attention,

  one with the oblique line or the on with the curve? Or, which one fits the best

    about using a straight(er) line but letting it extend below the baseline?"

  body: I like the crossed line to keep Q running flush in all caps setting (same
    with cap J), but it needs some help in the bold weight, I can understand why you
    are having trouble. How are other bold designs completed?

    I will try your suggestion. At first glance, this seems a good idea, but I wonder
    how it will fit with other letters.\r\n\r\nIf i choose the crossed line, I know
    I will have to work on the thickness of the line to avoid problem a small size.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your advice."

    then, your design seems blacker, and the shape of the O/Q more square, which takes
    up the space where the line might sit.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    now. That could be an alternative to the hooked tail in your first example. Perhaps
    someone will drop by with an image.\r\n\r\nIt might get confused with some diacritic
    though? I'm not sure, my knowledge is not extensive enough to foresee."

    perfect with the shape of the O of Univers, less square then mine though. However,
    I will try it. I think the dovetail could be a way to go, but I wonder if it will
    fit with the letter design.\r\n\r\nDarrel: Interesting suggestion, I'll come back
    with some try.\r\n\r\nStill to continue. Thanks"

    and a bold weight without? I mean, in the way there is a difference in the design,
    as if the bolder weight were not part of the same family.

    is that the overall feeling is right, more than the technical construction.\r\nYou
    could shorten the inside stroke of the light weight so to better suggest that
    it will be covered by the outer stroke in bolder weights. Or you could hint it
    in bolder weights using just a triangle shape instead of a full stroke."

    try a bar slightly narrower than your 'I', and rotate that 15\xB0 to 20\xB0 to

    your 'O'."
