  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p>So&hellip; I&rsquo;m currently developing a video game for this women&rsquo;s tackle football league, and wanted a font that had that blocky, authoritative look that you see on all the tv networks' NFL coverage&hellip; but I wanted something a little warm, too. (For lack of a better word, more <em>feminine</em>.)</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find something, so last Saturday I started work on this.</p>
<p>The game is due out in four months, so I&rsquo;m a bit pressed for time&hellip; I was wondering if anybody had comments. I think it looks a little too cartoony; it&rsquo;s supposed to look kind of elegant and sexy, yet blocky. Not sure what&rsquo;s going wrong there.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Stainless looks really nice, especially the extended versions. I forgot to mention, yeah, I&rsquo;m totally open to ditching my thing and going with something that&rsquo;s already out there, if I can embed it in a flash file.</p>
<p>(Of course, my needs for a font are pretty limited right now; It will never be shown as big as my sample, I&rsquo;d just use it for panel titles and menus and such, and it will never appear in print.)</p>
<p>But like most things I saw, Stainless is&hellip; a bit too sterile, I think? Severe? Having trouble articulating what I want here. Sort of something that&rsquo;s really classy like Aviano Sans, but with that sportsy, blocky look. Oh, and still casual somehow.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m being too picky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually happily go with Aviano, but I can&rsquo;t possibly afford the embedding license, sadly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made the character widths a little more consistent, and fixed a few of the more awkward characters like s and k.</p>

<p>It still needs work obviously, but I&rsquo;m actually pretty happy so far. I think next I&rsquo;ll increase the weight overall a little, and make the stress on the ovals a bit more contrasty.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest. Been cleaning up the small caps more, trying to even out the widths of everything. And I&rsquo;ve got a few large caps.</p>
<p>There are a few numbers too, but they&rsquo;re terribly rough right now.</p>
<p>To my eyes this is looking pretty good, but if that statement leaves any of you scratching your heads, I&rsquo;d love to know. ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, you asked more than once, so here&rsquo;s my two bits: you have a sound idea, but the execution doesn&rsquo;t look professional. The ideas are not consistently carried through&ndash;eg the tapered and bent verticals on the MN aren&rsquo;t followed elsewhere, and even the M and N are different treatments. The weight of the horizontals seem too heavy and clunky. Compare [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Armada/inuse|Armada]] by Tobias Frere-Jones for a balanced and polished execution of a related idea. Finally, the a lot of the curves are wonky, and the tail of the Q looks way out of place.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the detailed tips&hellip; I can really see what you mean about the inconsistencies and symmetry now.</p>
<p>William &ndash; as for wonky curves, could you be more specific? I actually like the A, U, V, W and Y very much, but any of the round stuff is starting to look a bit strange now that you mention it. But I can&rsquo;t quite see what&rsquo;s wrong there. I&rsquo;m thinking I should have the horizontals get a little thinner in the middle to match some of those verticals. I&rsquo;d actually done that very early on, and abandoned it for some reason&hellip;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest.</p>
<p>Totally re-did the S. The first one was supposed to be sort of stylishly asymmetric. Guess that wasn&rsquo;t working. So this is a little dull, perhaps, but at least seems like a better place to be working from.</p>
<p>I changed the horizontal curves on the O, Q, U, C and G so they get a little thinner in the middle. I think that&rsquo;s helped a lot; thanks for mentioning that. Also made the C more balanced top-top-bottom. Again, it was supposed to add a little character having it top heavy, and I don&rsquo;t think it worked.</p>
<p>Also worked a little on the M and N. Still not thrilled with those; I&rsquo;ll have to have a closer look at them.</p>
<p>I looked closely at Armada, and I think it&rsquo;s been helpful&hellip; I&rsquo;m finding the curves on things like the lowercase p really interesting.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m starting to get a better feel for this. But if I&rsquo;m on the wrong track, could somebody please let me know?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to make this look more professional, more balanced. I thought I&rsquo;d start by looking at the whitespace; people at TypeCon are always talking about that. But I&rsquo;ve never really looked at it much.</p>
<p>I started with a redesigned R, that I&rsquo;m fairly happy with (though it appears to be falling forward or something now).</p>
<p>My normal instinct for the P then, would be to just remove the diagonal stroke on the R. But, without that there, the bottom of the bowl of the P doesn&rsquo;t feel balanced anymore; the diagonal was taking up some of that whitespace there. So I made the bowl a smidge taller.</p>
<p>Having done that, the bowl felt a smidge too big, compared to the R.. so I made it thinner, trying to make the whitespace in the bowls similar in area, if not in shape.</p>
<p>With that sort of logic in mind, I&rsquo;ve increased the width of the E to make those counters match the R, and made the F a little thinner than the E, and moved the center bar down a tiny bit.</p>
<p>On to the horizontal bars on the A, E, B and F. I&rsquo;ve made those thinner; if the height of the horizontal bar on the top or bottom of the E is a particular percentance of the cap height, I figured the height of the center bar should be the around same percentage of the height between the top of the bottom bar and the bottom of the top bar&hellip; so that visually, they look the same. Just a guess, but I think that&rsquo;s helped.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m babbling. There&rsquo;s also a more conservative Q now, and I fixed up the S so it looks a little more balanced.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Way better; you&rsquo;re starting to get your &lsquo;type eyes&rsquo; :)</p>
<p>The key to making it better is to study a lot of other stuff in depth.</p>
<p>You can start with similar stuff. Armada is good, because it&rsquo;s Tobias Frere-Jones, who is one of the best, even though this is relatively early in his career. [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Clicker|Clicker]]&ndash;done for TV guide on the basis of the old TV screen shape&ndash;is another to look at. Also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/eurostile/|Eurostile]].</p>
<p>You probably would find useful Karen Cheng&rsquo;s book Designing Type, which has a lot of comparisons between the widths and proportions of the caps.</p>
<p>The idea of something wide, a bit squarish rounds, and somewhat Albertus serifs is fresh, I think. But you need both more consistency and better proportions to make this sing. On proportions see Cheng&rsquo;s book. There are no hard and fast rules, but still that will educate your eye. On consistency, I think for example the S needs to be more &lsquo;cornered&rsquo; to look consistent with the rest of the face. check Armada, Clicker and Eurostile. Now the S looks like it can&rsquo;t decide what it wants to be when it grows up :) The D also needs to relate to the O, and currently looks like its having a severe identify crisis.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been studying Michelangelo, Beata, Eurostile and Microgramma pretty closely for this. That&rsquo;s been really helpful.</p>
<p>Here are some disconnected notes&hellip;</p>
<p>-Been working on the diagonals a bit. I think they&rsquo;re a bit more consistent now, though I&rsquo;m still not happy with the K.
-Made the tops of the B, R and P a little curved to counteract that leaning effect.
-Staightened up the D.
-Made the U thinner, but I think I overdid it.
-Made the S a little more angular. I think I need to go farther with that.
-Made lots of changes to the overshoots and width of various things, to get things looking more consistent. I&rsquo;m trying to be less rigid about the numbers and just eyeball it.</p>
