body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI've got some red values amongst my kerning, which I'm assuming
  means they don't match what class 'leader's value. Could this be solved by expanding,
  and then compressing kerning, using fontlab's kerning assistance? Or will this cause
  new problems?\r\n\r\nAnd, what exactly does 'keep existing pairs' in the 'expand
  kerning' window mean? It seems quite logical to me that I wan't to keep my existing
  pairs, but apparantly it isn't?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJasper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Just delete them.\r\nThe values for those kern pairs will be replaced by
    class kerning values.\r\n\r\nIf they persist, then you know that there are con\uFB02icts,
    with a glyph appearing in more than one class.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you may have
    a class for (V' W), and another for (T' Y), but at some point have the bright
    idea that Y is quite similar to V and W, and decide to put it in that class, for
    (V' W Y)\r\n\r\nSo if VA is kerned -80, and TA is kerned -100, then Y will be
    embarrassed, not knowing exactly how intimate it should be with A."

  body: I wouldn't expand the kerning. The red values are, as you said, exceptions
    to the class rules, and if you meant them to be exceptions, it's fine to leave
    them there. If you've made exceptions by accident (by kerning in class kerning
    with exceptions mode instead of just class kerning mode) just go through and delete
    the red kern pairs. Exceptions are useful - for example, the /i/ class will probably
    contain all i diacritic glyphs, and the vast majority of the time they'll kern
    the same as i, but for certain situations different kerning is needed. It's easier
    to control these as exceptions rather than have a specific idiacritic kerning
    class.

  body: "Thanks both. So if I undertand you correctly there is no harm in having class
    exceptions. Baring filesize in mind though (especially considering webfonts) it
    seems better to compress kerning. Is there a risk of losing kern pairs there,
    or does fontlab do the job as it should?\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Ohh, and btw: This might be a stupid question, but what''s the use of the
    apostrophe after the first glyph of a class (as in nick shinn''s example)? The
    classes seem to work fine without it...'

  body: That's what I assumed. Without an apostrophe, though, fontlab just takes the
    first glyph in the row as the key glyph, which works fine for me.
