Unfortunately we were not able to identify the font by ourselves

similar versions we would also be more than happy.

DeVinne seems to be pretty close, but I can't go for it cause there is no bold version, and it looks quite quirky if you set a bigger amount of text.
Alt Latin sounds interesting but I couldn't find any sample of it.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm seeing differences in all of these Erik, with either the g, t or f. They are all close, including DeVinne, which was what Century was based upon, but I haven't seen any that are exactly the same. We don't know if the sample we are shown are metal, or digital, or how old they are. Both of these families have been produced in a host of versions, but using the sc, italics and the numerals hasn't helped to isolate one from the sources I can find. If this is from a European foundry that none of us has information about we can look until we go blind, and never exactly match it. 

You may just have to pick the closest digital font you can find. We have given you some suggestions.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>We don’t know if the sample we are shown are metal, or digital, or how old they are</em>
Yes, we do. Or at least I can guess from both the language and the printing that this book is from the beginning of the previous century, i.e. between 1900 and 1930. Max Planck published his first major paper in 1900, and the text refers to one of Planck’s discoveries concerning radiation. That’s why <em>Alt Latein</em> is a good guess. German scientific publishers were very conservative typographically. 

Every foundry had a face like that, even before ATF Century (1904). As they were all more or less copies of each other, you’d have to look at a lot of old specimens to find the exact font. The book was probably set in Linotype or Intertype, but it could have been Monotype because of the amount of formulars involved. Mono wasn’t very widespread in Germany, but when it came to that type of setting, no other system was as flexible. 

Finding the exact face wouldn’t do you any good, as you’d want to set the book today, and presumably not in hot metal.</div>

Of course not. We’re looking at a letterpress sample from 100 years ago. Fonts then often were size-specific, and digital versions will never be 100% identical. These people are looking to create a similar feel, not produce an exact clone, with bad spacing, no kerning et al.</div>

There seems to be a common understanding that there is 
no digital version of this particular font.
All your suggestions are fonts we have already considered.
Does anyone have some experience with setting a bigger

We are thinking about commissioning someone to digitalize
the font, anyboby interested?

taken from the lineto website:
Called «Normande Halbfett» or «Antiqua Halbfett», its origins are a little unclear. «Normande» was published through the swiss-based Haas foundry, while the «Antiqua Halbfett» or «Gewöhnliche Antiqua» has its roots in Scotland and was published through Monotype in England at the beginning of the 19th century. The design is reminiscent of classical Antiqua faces like Didot or Bodoni, but is more accentuated.

		<div class="commentbody">Looks most like Monotype Modern Extended (as suggested by Erik), of which it seems there were several iterations and lots of size variants (again see Erik above). I have had a look at <em>Book Types from Clowes</em> and it seems identical to Monotype Modern Extended No 1 except for the unique letter 'f'. 

Here's a theory (maybe nonsense): 

Is it possible that German type needs a narrower 'f' because the next letter is very often 'u umlaut' (in the word 'für' which I would guess is the most common word that uses the letter 'f' in German and would give a rather unpleasant yet very common 'fü' pair—see illustration below—with a standard English 'f'). Hence a 'German' Modern (if well-crafted) will be slightly different (i.e. narrower) in the 'f' department? Anyone ever thought about an fudiesesis ligature for the  word 'für'?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fur_5339.gif]

 Finally, what about the pointy italic 'v', that's got to be a 'nu' hasn't it? Every Modern I can find has curvy  italic 'v'.

Great type though. Whatever it is.</div>
