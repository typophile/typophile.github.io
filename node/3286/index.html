<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all, <br> <br>The company is a new technology transfer business -- they take newly developed materials and technologies and try to fashion useful products out of them. Their clients will mostly be people buying or selling these materials/products, so sciency material engineering type companies and people who buy weird and wonderful, high-tech things -- from aeronautical to IT manufacturers. <br> <br>They are a British company, and want something that makes them look serious and modern, as well as something that will work equally well in the US, Europe and Asia. <br> <br>To make things a bit more complicated, the name is pronounced dia-meter rather than just diameter, and I've been told not to punctuate the word in the logo to make this distinction clear. <br> <br>I'd love to hear any opinions on the logos I've come up with, including the colours and tag-line -- it's difficult to think of something snappy involving material applications! <br> <br>Thanks in advance everyone, it's most appreciated. <br> <br><a href=http://www.jordanharper.uklinux.net/diameter_logos.gif target=_blank>http://www.jordanharper.uklinux.net/diameter_logos.gif</a> <br> <br>Jordan <br> <br>PS I know that the arc on 1a and 1b could do with shifting a little to be optically central wrt to 'dia'.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Did you mean "NOT" punctuate the word "dia" or? <br> <br>If it was meant to be punctuated, I would pick 1b. Modern for sure, but I'm not sure about serious. Maybe you should revise your color choices. Is that Cholla? <br> <br>Overall I like the logo. Good job!

<div class=commentbody>Logo 1b works the best...So far, but I still think this has far to go. I think the dark orange color could symbolize rust as in old metal. It is a complementary color but no good in this case. Typeface Cholla is overused in my opinion. Tagline should not extend beyond logo, It is had to tell form picture , maybe it does not extend beyond logo but with all the negative space around the lc. r is may need to be moved left a bit. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't like the #2 options at all. The arc looks like a "c" that fell down from the sky. <br> <br>1b is best. As everyone else is suggesting, the colors are a little weak for a company going for "serious". Serious colors tend to be on the darker side (dark blues, purples, reds, etc.). Good job so far. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think Cholla is working OK here, but Ole is right - try to find something in that spirit but less common. <br> <br>The top ones are nice (except your circle arc is wobbly on the bottom-left) - but maybe use a darker weight of the type. <br> <br>BTW, I'm also confused about "punctuation" being desired or not by the client. If it is desired, I was thinking you could put a bullet with a slanted line going through it between "dia" and "meter". Because for one thing what you're shoing now is a <i>circumference</i>... <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>It looks like he's showing Diameter to me. <br> <br>The Cholla concerns I would agree with, but <br>overuse to a Typophile is different than overuse <br>in general, imo. <br>If you posted this at any non-type forums, I'm <br>guessing it wouldn't be a concern. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you so much everyone for your feedback -- I'm kind of glad a common (stylistic at least) consensus has settled on 1b. Everyone else (non designers) points there too, so I think I'm on to something (as embryonic as it may be!) <br> <br>Just to clarify the punctuation thing: the word is pronouced (for the purposes of this client) diamEter, as if it were two words, dia and meter, but he wants to emphasise this without punctuating the logotype with a hyphen or anything (hence the duotone word). <br> <br>ole: I see what you mean about the orange -- rust + modern materials company = bad idea! Cholla is overused from our point of view, but (as BJ Harvey says) most non-designers don't see the overuse in the same light do, I don't think. I'm happy with the face at the moment (you may notice that I modified the upper join of the 'a' bowl a little). You're absolutely right about the tag-line too, it's an oversight on my part, thanks for bringing it to my attention. <br> <br>Scott: I'll look in to some more 'serious' colours, thanks for the feedback. <br> <br>Cristian: I agree about the 't' height, I may try bringing it down a little, thanks. <br> <br>Hrant: The arc is actually a segment of a (pixel) perfect circle, it's distortion may be an optical illusion caused by the fact that it's a little more than a semicircle and I've rounded the ends. Good spot though <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> Nice idea about the punctuation too, I almost want to try it out! <br> <br>Thanks again everyone, I'll post up some new comps once I've processed all this feedback. <br> <br>Jordan</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi BJ. Well to some extent I agree with you about your counter-punch to my critique of using Cholla. But besides commonality and overuse lets take it one step further. Copyrighting. A semi-circle and Cholla for a logo. Could easily get you a bit stuck when you need to proper legal mark. This is one reason why I often do custom type in my clients identity work. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Ole, i agree with you about the custom type, for sure! <br> <br>Cholla is/was the regular titling typeface at Entertainment Weekly, <br>probably its most prominent usage ... <br>but I don't think it's in the Mrs. Eaves or Helvetica category <br>as far as overuse. <br> <br>(i haven't seen EW lately, however.) <br> <br>And this particular usage doesn't scream Cholla the <br>way other uses might. (With ligatures turned on, etc.) <br> <br>Of course determining overuse is subjective. <br> <br>anyway, yeah, custom type is a good idea. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>Refer back to my post #196. <br> <br>If your client is going for "serious" and "corporate", the solution is to simply use almost any color, but dark. For example, your blue looks like PMS 641C (on my screen anyway), but to make it corporate you should use something more in the neighborhood of PMS 648C, and maybe replace the gray with PMS 647C. I'm not suggesting that these are the colors to use, but I promise if you show your client these darker ranges, he'll be a much easier sell. <br> <br>Aloha! <br>Scott</div>
