  fell in love with it. Being a student, saving up the money took a while (and involved
  eating far more ramen than I am comfortable admitting to), but I finally got the
  money I needed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, to my dismay, I discovered that House Industries
  only takes creditcard payments.\r\n\r\nSo... would anyone happen to know of a font
  that is similar in feel but is sold by a company that accepts PayPal?"

  body: Well if you went to all that trouble to get Neutraface I don't think you should
    settle for anything else. I'd at least write to House Industries and see what
    they say. They might have a solution for you.

    House Ind. fonts.

  body: "Thanks for the replies, everyone.\r\n\r\npenn.and.ink - That's not an option
    for me, at least at present. It would require me to either get a salaried job
    or register my freelance activities with the chamber of commerce (i.e. start my
    own company).\r\n\r\nNick Shinn - My friends are students, and thus don't have
    credit cards. My family, meanwhile, is wholly convinced that the moment they use
    a credit card on the internet, the Russian mafia will gain unlimited access to
    their bank accounts.\r\n\r\noldnick - Nice font, but not quite what I'm looking
    for. What I'm searching for is something that isn't necessarily similar in its
    style, but has a similar combination of formality and informality while maintaining
    legibility.\r\n\r\nFor example, fonts like Gotham and Verlag (which also both
    require a cc - argh!) actually come closer than fonts which are technically more
    similar. In fact, even Basic Commercial would probably come closer, though it
    lacks the personality I'm looking for.\r\n\r\npaul d hunt - It seems they like
    only accept customers in Germany, while I'm in the Netherlands."

    but here in UK you can get them\r\nfrom Western Union shops. Since the 'credit'
    only means\r\nVisa or Mastercard logo, actually you just top up and\r\nuse. Not
    so different from topping up a mobile pay-as-you-go\r\naccount."

    service in the Netherlands (probably due to there being a single nationally dominant
    online payment system here), I did manage to find a (British) company that offers
    prepaid credit cards to Dutch customers.\r\n\r\nWith a bit of luck, I'll soon
    be able to get Neutraface :)"
