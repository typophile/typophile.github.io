  Glyphs, it's big circles with thick anti-aliased line. Do I need to turn on something?"

  body: "no, paths.\r\nthe align buttons on the palette align entire paths but not
    nodes within a path.\r\nTo align 2 or more nodes (or anchors) use shift+cmd+a.\r\n\r\nDid
    you read the Glyphs guide?\r\nhttp://glyphsapp.com/dateien/GlyphsHandbook20111222.pdf"

  body: "But shortcut aligns nodes only to the relative center between them. What
    if I want only 1 node to be moved? As it's usually the case.\r\nLet's say stem's
    upper node is a bit off to the left. I want it to move to buttom one's X position.\r\nThanks
    for the link, but there's no info on that."

  body: "Hello!\r\nupdate Glyphs to 1.2 to be able to set an anchor for nodes alignment.\r\nNotice
    that it aligns the nodes to the path's smaller edge.\r\nIf you need more control,
    open the lock in the info box and set the width or height to 0."
