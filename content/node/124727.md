  problem is the large midsection of the G. All the fonts I've tried have not had
  as large of one.\r\nRuled out fonts:\r\nAdobe Garamond\r\nEB Garamond\r\nGaramond
  Classico\r\nGaramond SC\r\nGaramond\r\nGaramond 3 URW\r\nApple Garamond\r\npretty
  much any \"condensed\" Garamond font\r\n\r\nPartially Ruled-Out: Sabon Next (might
  actually be it)\r\n\r\nI may have missed something but I've compared all these to
  the logo."
