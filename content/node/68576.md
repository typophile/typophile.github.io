  letter to whatever suited my purpose. Apart from the obvious experience and expertise
  you would gain by being trained in this craft, when creating a typface is it a case
  of working on points / corner / edges of a character getting to a point where it
  feels right, then moving onto other characters?\r\n\r\nSay when looking at certain
  free fonts you can immediately tell that a majority, there edges just do not feel
  correct and you run into all sorts of scalability and edge issues when you try to
  use them, as opposed to some versions of the same / similar typeface but done by
  a professional. "

    an amateur type designer myself, and although I started out with a design about
    two years ago, I still haven't come up with a quality font, I'm still working
    on it (not full time obviously). I guess it depends on what you call <cite>perfectly
    crafted</cite>. I know for a fact that it takes some type desingers six years
    to create one quality font. The final stage (digitizing) is I believe the shortest
    phase. Of course, there are other designers who'll do it a lot quicker, like Tomi
    from Suomi, who holds the world record (http://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/201002.html)
    at 3 hours and 4 minutes...\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJean Paul"

    A great typeface \"is not a collection of beautiful letters, but a beautiful collection
    of letters.\" The key thing is designing each glyph in the context of other characters.
    Often designers do focus on getting a core of 'control characters' to work together.
    Your design idea might even start with a single character, but to realize it in
    a face, the development effort is design in context. And the 'craft' is a lot
    about design characters so they work together and look good together and are easily
    readable together.  \r\n\r\nIf you read Tracy's 'Letters of Credit', and look
    at [[http://briem.net/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm|Briem's web site]] you will
    get the idea. "

    think this works. What might look perfect in isolation usually needs tweaking

    It's, for now, some rough going, but one of its most promising features is you

    digitize it. In my opinion this goes for type design as well as design for anything

    What is a perfectly crafted font? Are you thinking of Gill Sans, Times Roman,

    fonts?"

    doesn't exist ;-) what about an answer like this:\r\n\"A perfectly crafted font
    is a work of craft which exploited in the best possible way the technical tools
    available at the time in order to reproduce a perfectly crafted typeface (notice
    the two distinct meanings of \"crafted\"). Whereas a perfectly crafted typeface
    is a work of design which serve in the best possible way a given function in a
    given period of time\"."
