    Will you have speaker notes or presentation slides or pdf for those of us who
    missed it?\r\n\r\nI also missed seeing Matthew Carter at the type crits.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    as well. I snuck out to play tunes at an Irish music session at Nietzsche's that
    afternoon. \r\n\r\nIt was a great week.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: Chris - Matthew Carter was unable to attend at the last minute. I believe
    it's the first TypeCon he's missed. Eben's talk was excellent, especially the
    slides. I hope he'll share them online.

  body: "Thanks for those kind words Stewf!\r\n\r\nI was told that he was just very
    busy with a project - no doubt one we will all be excited to see. I have a request
    in to try to see him since he may not be at Atypi either. fingers crossed! \r\n\r\nI
    will post the talk & it's images at some point after I have settled in at Reading.
    The main reason being - I have much more stuff that would just assume go in that
    20 min at Typecon would not permit. The Atypi slot is 50 min so more things will
    fit. \r\n\r\nAlso I was just at the Boston Rare Books room and found a copy of
    the Iambluchus ( Aldine/Griffo ) that was printed very well. I think some of those
    images might make it into the talk as well. I have one more week in Boston coming
    up and with luck I may find other interesting stuff. And who knows, maybe more
    folk will send me more cool things to see. I know I would like to put Paul Hunt's
    font in."
