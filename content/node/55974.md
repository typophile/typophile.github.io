  body: "As far as I know, the \"sputnik\" currency symbol is still used as a placeholder
    in some text editors and spreadsheet programs and such. This was always a substitute
    symbol to be used when a proper symbol wasn't available for any given currency,
    though, and had nothing in particular to do with the euro. However, since it saw
    such little use, many font foundries placed the euro symbol in its slot for a
    while as a hack to make the euro available before proper Unicode encoding became
    prevalent.\r\n\r\nThere used to be the \"ECU\" which had the ligated CE symbol,
    but that was barely more than a conceptual finance basket when it was replaced
    by the euro hard currency."

  body: "The running joke back when I went to high school was that this was a symbol
    for Roubles. On the keyboards of Yamaha computers we had in a computer lab the
    symbol sat between $, \xA3 and \xA5, so it implied it was a currency sign. And
    since the lab together with the high school was in Russia, it was only natural
    to assign the symbol to the Roubles :-)"
