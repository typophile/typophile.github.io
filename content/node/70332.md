body: "The following extended Latin letters and diacritic marks are completely unknown
  to me in the sense that I have never seen them in actual use, and I was hoping to
  get some advice on preferred designs.  Thanks in advance for any help.  My immediate
  goal is to come up with designs that work for Bodoni 72, but most of the questions
  are rather more general.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nU+126 \u0126 (H with stroke) often has
  a horizontal line through the letter, but there are also examples of designs with
  a double crossbar:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H-bar_3750.png]\r\n\r\nWould
  it be acceptable to centre the crossbars vertically?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H-bar-2_6252.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  a particular design preferred for Maltese?  Is this letter used in any other languages?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nU+127
  \u0127 (h with stroke) normally has a horizontal stroke (as opposed to a diagonal
  one), which probably makes sense for consistency with the uppercase.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nU+138
  \u0138 (kra) appears indistinguishable from Cyrillic lowercase k in the Unicode
  tables, whereas I would have expected it to have the same top-left serif as a Latin
  k or n, and perhaps a straight rather than curly lower diagonal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kra_4872.gif]\r\n\r\nApparently,
  this is an obsolete Greenlandic letter. Does anyone know its correct shape?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nU+166
  \u0166 and U+167 \u0167 appear with a horizontal stroke in the Unicode tables, but
  with a diagonal stroke elsewhere (e.g., ECMA-94):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T-stroke_3555.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  main Language using this letter appears to be Northern Saami. Would the following
  designs with strokes borrowed from Polish L/l be acceptable?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T-stroke-2_6168.png]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nUppercase
  \u014A often has a very thin descender, to match the right vertical of the N. A
  design based directly on N+J works less well than the standard lowercase n+j design:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eng_4057.png]\r\n\r\nApart
  from the oversized lowercase approach, what would the best solution be (for a Bodoni)?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe
  Vietnamese horn interferes with the right serif on uppercase U. Is the preferred
  solution to have the horn at different heights for U and O (in such a way that it
  naturally replaces the serif on the U without ending up too close to the centre
  of the O)?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Horn_5230.png]\r\n\r\nAre
  there any designs with the horn below or extending to the right of the serif?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWould
  the Vietnamese hook diacritic in a Bodoni normally have a top-left ball terminal
  and curve slightly to the right at the bottom (like a dotless question mark in miniature)?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hook_3798.png]\r\n\r\nExamples
  of well-designed Vietnamese fonts in a Bodoni-like style would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"

    letters, I started a thread a while back and several others gave some great links.
    The thread is <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/62439\">here</a>. It may not
    answer your exact questions but it's good anyway to see some examples of horn
    and hook there, and doubtless you are drawing other Vietnamese diacritics."

  body: "\u0126 : I usually design this so that the lower bar is slightly lower than
    the crossbar of the H, to create more room above it for the second bar. And I
    usually extend the upper bar through the side stems, because that is the form
    as I saw it in earlier printed Maltese books. When I was in Malta, I saw both
    forms in use: with the bar extended and not as in the examples you show. I also
    saw versions with the two bars optically centered as you suggest, but these were
    in sans serif signage and display type, not text.\r\n___\r\n\r\n\u0138 : See http://typophile.com/node/18546\r\n\r\nI
    believe the glyph shown in the Unicode charts is misleading. Unless your Latin
    lowercase has characteristics that support such a Cyrillic-like form, it will
    look like an alien visitor.\r\n___\r\n\r\n\u0166 : I've always seen this with
    a horizontal bar, which corresponds with that of the letter \u0110/\u0111, also
    used in Northern Saami.\r\n___\r\n\r\n\u014A : Your revised form is heading in
    the right direction. The hook should descend as far as that of the J, or the tail
    of the Q, i.e. not usually as deep as the lowercase descenders.\r\n\r\nNote that
    this uppercase form is normal for European fonts. For African languages, the n-like
    shape is preferred.\r\n___\r\n\r\nVietname horn : I've seen (and designed) both
    arrangements: with the horn coming out of the side of the letter and with it coming
    off the top right. Your solutions all look reasonable to me; just watch out that
    the horn has enough room to breathe, both between it and the letter to which it
    is attached and with regard to a following letter.\r\n___\r\n\r\nVietnamese hook
    : Always tricky. Your shape looks okay, and is appropriate to the style. But you
    have to test in print and see how it looks alongside the other marks. It is easy
    to make this either too dark or too light."

  body: "Thanks for your replies. Below is a summary of my current understanding with
    further comments and questions.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAs far as the length of the
    upper bar is concerned, \u0126 can take either of the following forms, but the
    second is the more traditional one in Maltese typography.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H-bar-3_5443.png]\r\n\r\nVertically
    symmetric placement of the bars is somewhat of a novelty and probably best avoided,
    but the lower bar may be at a slightly lower position than that of the single
    bar in a regular H. This leaves the question as to the preferred distance between
    the bars; fonts on my computer have distances varying between approximately 1/8
    and 3/8 of the letter's full height:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/H-bar-4_4597.png]\r\n\r\n(Many
    of these are clearly not well designed.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nJohn Hudson did not
    mention \u0127, which probably means that the form with horizontal bar is the
    only acceptable one on Malta. The following design matches that of \u0111:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/h-bar-5_3641.png]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDespite
    the \u0138 glyph in the Unicode charts, kra is essentially a k without ascender
    (1st picture below), but it should have the same top-left serif as a u (2nd picture);
    a shorter top-right serif akin to a (small-)capital K might be better (3rd picture):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kra-2_4387.png]\r\n\r\n(The
    u serif is so flat in this font that the only obvious difference between kra and
    a small-capital k is that the latter has a top-left serif extending to the right.)\r\n\r\nSamuel
    Kleinschmidt's 1851 grammar does show a kra with ball terminal, but all the Greenlandic
    letters are printed in italics, so this applies to k as well:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kra-3_5145.png]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThanks
    for pointing out the parallelism between \u0166/\u0167 and \u0110/\u0111. A \u0167
    with diagonal bar would have matched an eth-like \u0111, but 19th-century Lappish
    grammars already used the modern/current forms with horizontal bars. It would
    be interesting to see an extract from the late 19th-century Bible.\r\n\r\nThe
    bar on \u0167 should perhaps be a bit lower:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T-bar_3623.png]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\u014A:
    Perhaps the slightly smaller ball from a lowercase j is more appropriate?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eng-4_5580.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    for the depth, Q has full descender depth in this font, whereas J is \u2018half-deep\u2019,
    which probably gives some latitude.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMany of the Vietnamese TeX
    samples from the earlier thread show the U/u horn at an intermediate vertical
    position:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/U-horn_6720.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    works well for the lowercase u, but perhaps less well for the uppercase U.\r\n\r\nMy
    original question was whether it would be acceptable to put the horn lower on
    O than on U lest it end up too far to the left on the O (without making the horn
    exceedingly wide).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nYour comments and the samples in the previous
    thread confirm the basic shape of the hook. I may return with further questions
    related to that one once I try to put together complete Vietnamese accented letters."

    characters feel less like an afterthought when the additional bar on the upper/lower-case
    letters matches the (original) horizontal bar on H/t. Many fonts do not follow
    this, but it is difficult to know whether the choice of a different stroke width
    was a conscious one.\r\n\r\nK with hook is an African letter which has not been
    mentioned earlier in this thread and of which I know nothing. Your kra (cf. the
    Palimpsest thread) appears to have the correct shape.\r\n\r\nThe capital Eng is
    perhaps a bit heavy in the bottom-right corner of the N (i.e., around the bottom
    of the diagonal) and a bit light at the bottom, but there is no other obvious
    solution given the shape of the J/j. Sorry for this not particularly constructive
    remark.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in an earlier thread that Vietnamese grave
    traditionally goes to the left of the circumflex.\r\n\r\nSome of the Vietnamese
    diacritics extend quite far to the right (e.g., lower-case a with circumflex and
    acute) \u2014 do they not interfere with a following ascender (e.g., l or b)?
    \ You  might want to shorten the acute slightly (cut it at an angle at the bottom
    to make it fit atop the circumflex)."
