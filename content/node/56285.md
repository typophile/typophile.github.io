body: "I was traipsing around the internet recently and came across <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ultrasparky/3218770932/\">Daniel
  Rhatigan's picture of an old Monotype specimen on Flickr</a> and his mention of
  an [[http://typophile.com/node/28292|older thread here.]]\r\n\r\nTiffany says that
  it looks like the italic for Renner's Steile Futura, which is the starting point
  of another massive discussion [[http://www.typophile.com/node/18227|here]] (which
  I confess I missed at the time). And I agree with her \u2013 the two faces are startlingly
  close, but Daniel's date for the Monotype specimen pre-dates Steile Futura by at
  least a decade.\r\n\r\nAt last I have got off my arse and done something about it
  (outlines in progress below), but the question I want to ask now is <em>\"Is Monotype
  Condensa an (English) knock-off of the (German) Steile Futura Italic?\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Condensa_outlines_5483.jpg]"
