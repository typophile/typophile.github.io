  \"El Libro Semanal\". \r\nFor the editorial design of the final thesis I need a
  nice pair of  cool fonts, and I'm thinking in \"borrowing\" the font this comic
  uses for the texts and dialogue ballons, though I still dont know wich one is it.
  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_3547.jpg]"

    a thesis work?\r\n\r\nDo you think that any of them are a good choice?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I still can't choose between both fonts. Wich one resembles best the
    font used in <em>Libro Semanal</em>? And, if you can't pick by similarity, then
    wich one would you choose?\r\n\r\n(Sorry, by the way, for my bad english. I'm,

  body: Hi hrant. Now I get why yo suggested the Bitstream font as the one. Anyways
    I share your opinion that Neuzit seems to be better. I was thinking using it for
    the headers, chapter names, subtitles, etc. Garamond's gonna be the font for text.
    I hope that's a good choice

    by "borrowing" "cool fonts" that the creator of "El Libro Semanal" uses that are
    decidedly not Mexican. Or am I missing something here?

    it. Anyways I really like Pradell. Maybe I'll use it, maybe not (I find it someway

    Man: Haha, no way (I hope). I have no interest in demostrate how mexican my thesis
    is (though I really like all that national/cultural identity discussion). I'm
    picking the font we've been discussing because what I'm certainly doing is borrowing
    some visual elements from <em>El Libro Semanal</em>. Wich are: the size of the
    publication (pocket-like), some aspects of the paper (recycled from many different
    other kinds of paper but with a better quality, like handcrafted) and the font.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm trying to do with this is to make some visual connection between the <em>Libro
    Semanal</em> and my (publicated) thesis. I'd like to think in both publications
    like visual relatives, but also it's a way to pay homage to a comic book that
    I really like because, as you well said, it's very, very \"mexican\".\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    although hrant has a point in his last reply, I don't think there is (a variety
    of) something like \"mexican fonts\" since Mexico has been always copying fonts
    from Spain, France and, more recently, United States.\r\n\r\nSo, the point is,
    (1) the <em>Libro Semanal</em> is mexican, that's something I have no doubt. (2)
    I don't think my thesis <em>has</em> to be mexican. (3) And I'm not thinking that
    the fonts used in el <em>Libro Semanal</em> are mexican. (4) Anyways, I think
    Neuzit is a nice font for headlines, chapter names and titles.\r\n\r\nThat's it\r\n\r\n(Again,
    please don't take notice on my bad english)"
