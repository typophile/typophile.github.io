  am trying to use the egyptian hieroglyphs (unicode slot: U+13000 - U+1342F), but
  it seems they don't work on leopard.\r\n \r\nI have installed the font \"gardiner\"
  (you can find it in this website: http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ and directly download
  it from here: http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/Gardiner313.zip ) and in fact I can
  see the characters in the character palette, but when I open a file, or I run an
  application using this set of characters, my computer does not recognize them, and
  it shows only the classical series of black squares.\r\nAs for instance, I cannot
  see any hieroglyph in this test page http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/egyptian-hieroglyphs.html
  , or in this page of wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs#Unicode
  , even though my font is correctly installed.\r\n\r\nI tried it on lion, and it
  didn't work too. Curiously, it worked well on tiger.\r\n \r\nWhat is the problem?
  It is a problem with the font? Or for some reason apple is not able to deal correctly
  with this unicode slot?\r\n \r\nthanks in advance"

  body: Both test pages work fine for me with the Gardiner313 font in Safari on Leopard
    (Safari 5.0.6 on OS X 10.5.8). Insertion into TextEdit via Glyphs view in character
    palette also works. (On that machine, I have no active font management program
    in use.)

  body: "I tried again with Safari 5.0.5 on OS X 10.6.8;  this time I called explicitly
    Gardiner in the html source of [[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/hieroglyph-table.html|this
    thread]], which is just a copy of the wikipedia table whose link is above, to
    which I added\r\n<pre>&lt;font face=\"Gardiner\"&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nbefore the table
    and\r\n<pre>&lt;/font&gt;\r\n</pre> after. Then the hieroglyphs display  fine.
    So, Gardiner displays correctly in Safari; the \"problem\" seems to be that  it
    is not used as a fall back font for Egyptian hieroglyphs (I simply installed Gardiner313.ttf
    in /Library/Fonts)"

    other fonts I created using the same unicode slots, and they have the same problem,
    it seems that not only Safari, but the mac OS system in general (I tried also
    in other applications, e.g. with a specific Input Method) does not have a fall
    back font for Egyptian Hieroglyph (Possibly, Mozilla uses some different approach
    to identify the font). The char palette works because it display all the fonts
    using those slots.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to solve the problem?
    If there is a way to force the system to recognise a specific font as fall back
    font for these unicode slots?"
