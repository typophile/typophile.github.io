body: A typeface based on my tag-style handwriting. Created using Sharpies<SUP>&reg;</SUP>,
  paper, scanner &amp; FreeHand. As I recreated the face in FreeHand I tried to even
  out the size of the letters a little while trying to keep the random, hand-drawn
  feeling. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m stuck on how I should finish out the face...<B>a.</B>
  make the letters a consistent size and let the end user add the random feeling or
  <B>b.</B> leave it alone.

  body: 'Kyle, <BR> <BR>Good show. There&#39;s a shortage of decent tag fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>I would leave the size inconsistencies <BR>as they are. If the user is required
    to resize <BR>letters at random they will end up with pen <BR>strokes that are
    out of proportion &#40;the enlarged <BR>glyphs having thicker strokes than they
    should&#41;. <BR> <BR>Zooming in on the flash file I noticed you&#39;re <BR>generally
    free of vectorization quirks&#42;. That&#39;s a <BR>tough point to reach. How
    big do you draw  <BR>before scanning? <BR> <BR>Great translation job overall.
    I can see this <BR>working at small sizes and as a huge display  <BR>face. It&#39;s
    wild, yet legible. Although I would <BR>consider reining in the &#39;t&#39; a
    bit - if only so <BR>it doesn&#39;t obscure the legibility of adjacent <BR>glyphs.
    <BR> <BR>This is also an excellent candidate for  <BR>alternates. Have a go at
    redrawing the  <BR>alphabet as you would normally &#40;allowing  <BR>for subtle
    variations in each glyph&#41; and see  <BR>if you can build a set of alts. <BR>

    See if you can smooth those out.'

    finial arrows &#40;Tag Team seems to have one&#41;. Also, it might be a good opportunity
    for ligatures. I wish I could write like that. '

  body: ' Fun. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re ambitious, you could achieve a greater  <BR>level
    of randomness by creating an alternate set.  <BR>By introducing other variations
    you wouldn&#39;t run  <BR>into the stroke weight problem Stephen mentions. <BR>
    <BR>This would add to the &#39;randomness&#39; by making it  <BR>possible to write
    &#39;street&#39; with two different Es. <BR> <BR>&#40;This is my beef with distressed
    faces. They  <BR>feel canned and phony when two of the same  <BR>characters are
    identical.&#41; '

  body: ' first of all, it would be nice to see a sample of how you <BR>might set
    a headline &#40;or text if you like&#41; with these  <BR>existing charcters. a
    line-up of the alphabet gives us a  <BR>good chance to look at induvidual glyphs,
    but very little  <BR>understanding of how it might look in context. <BR> <BR>secondly,
    with the idea of setting the characters at a  <BR>large display size, the vectorization
    oddities that  <BR>Steven mentions become more problematic. you might  <BR>think
    of producing a variation of the family in which the  <BR>&#42;oddities&#42; of
    the marker &#40;eg, bleed and soft corners&#41;  <BR>are featured. this would,
    of course, take an enormous  <BR>amount of time &#40;kind of an ironic feature
    of digitizing  <BR>this type of font&#41;, but I think you have a design with
    a  <BR>lot of potential  -- it may warrant that sort of  <BR>investment if you&#39;re
    going to make use of it. '

  body: 'I&#39;ve definitely thought about the idea of adding alternate characters
    to get more mileage out of the face...I think I&#39;ll try to do 5 different variations
    for every character.  <BR> <BR>I thought I had seen most of the other graf faces
    out there, but I&#39;d never seen Tag Team...very cool. <BR> <BR>Anyway, here&#39;s
    a typeset sample...other than a little kerning, this is what it looks like when
    it&#39;s typed. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback! <BR> <BR><!-Attachment: milk_test.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE
