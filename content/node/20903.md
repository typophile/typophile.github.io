  by this lovely reinterpretation of Bodoni and wanted to share it. The actual cover
  is embossed. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader/ref=sib_dp_pt/102-0249486-1501765?ie=UTF8&asin=1594200637\r\n\r\nI
  tried to download the image so I could insert it into the post but it didn't work."

  body: "A2/SW/HK do custom typefaces for every job. The mind boggles!\r\nI love this
    cover, and most of their work. Ratbaggy, I suspect that\r\nthere are two covers
    as the A2 one is probably a limited edition.\r\nIt's debossed and foil-blocked
    so it's gonna be expensive! \r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: My guess is the floral one is the UK edition. The A2 cover is the US hardcover
    trade edition, sells for around $25 which is pretty standard.
