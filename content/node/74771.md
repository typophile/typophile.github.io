body: "What would be the best/smart/easy way to transform an OT font that is fully
  featured and has several stylistic variants, into separate fonts for each feature,
  <strong>while still maintaining the kerning pairs </strong> etc.?\r\n\r\nFor example
  if an OT font has the standard latin characters + small caps + titling characters
  + alternates... to have the SC and Titling as standalone functional separate fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would be a good way to do do that?"

  body: "I've done this a few times. Basically, remove the default glyphs (e.g., a,
    b, c, etc.) from the font window and from the classes, then rename the glyphs
    that should replace them (e.g., A.smcp, B.smcp, C.smcp, etc.) with the default
    glyph names (e.g., a, b, c, etc.) using the \"Glyph > Rename Glyphs...\" command
    with the option \"Rename Glyphs in all Classes\" checked. This assumes you are
    using class-based kerning. (If not, I'm not sure how you could preserve the kerning.
    There may be a way, but I've never tried.) You'll also need to remove whatever
    feature code was used previously to make the substitution (e.g., smcp).\r\n\r\nThere
    is probably some way to automate this using Python, but I haven't spent enough
    time investigating the possibility. I'd like to hear about it if it has been done."

    scripting. If you interested, you can get it from [[http://github.com/khaledhosny/deotfy|github]].

  body: "Thanks Mark. Simple and logical. I imagined it will include changing glyph
    names in classes etc.\r\nWhich vertical Matrix values do you keep intact in font
    Info in order to keep all the styles consistent baring in mind some might not
    share the same x-hight or even cap-hight and so on?\r\n\r\nGreat Khaled. If that
    was for FontLab I would be a taker! :)"

  body: "If you click the \"Rename Glyphs in all Classes\" option when you use the
    \"Rename Glyphs...\" command (which I noted above), then, yes, the glyphs names
    will be changed in the classes as well, most importantly in the kerning classes.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want the vertical metrics to be the same across several font, then use the
    same values. Regarding vertical metrics, I recommend this document: http://kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf"

    it seems not to copy lookup info like kern. without python knowledge i can't add
    this part into your program. can you help, please? or maybe you know easy way
    to learn fontforgian library? ))\r\n"

  body: "The script keeps all other OpenType lookups in the font as is, so may be
    you want old \"kern\" table. Change line 117 from:\r\n  <code>outfont.generate(outfile)</code>\r\nTo:\r\n
    \ <code>outfont.generate(outfile, flags=(\"opentype\", \"old-kern\"))</code>\r\n\r\nAnd
    see if this works (I assume you are generating the font from the script directly
    not creating an intermediate SFD file)."

  body: All lookups are kept (copied to the output font, if you prefer), so if you
    can be more specific about the exact problem you have I'd be more able to help.

  body: "Actually, you don't really need to change the glyph names. All you need to
    do is to reassign the Unicode codepoints. In FontLab Studio, this can be fairly
    easily done with a different .nam file. You pick it and choose \"Generate Unicode\",
    then pick the different .nam file. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
