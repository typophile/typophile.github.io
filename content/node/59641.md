  of last 3 months applying for internships none stop but nobody seems to be interested,
  nobody has gotten back to me, even though I am willing to work for free to get my
  hands on any experience I can find. \r\n\r\nI changed fields, from gradating in
  product design, to working in online marketing as a brand executive for a year,
  where I became interested in the world of web design.  I enrolled myself on a graphic
  and web design course for 6 months and finished with an A grade.  But I don\u2019t
  seem to be getting anywhere with these web design internships.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  help with any advice?\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I am trying to build up my own personal
  website and asking for work from family and friends so I can build up my portfolio.
  \ But what else can I do to get into the scene?\r\n"

    . . . working in online marketing as a brand executive for a year</em>\r\nTalk
    to your previous(?) employer, co-workers, and clients and ask them to help you
    build your network of contacts. When you approach a new contact, say \"Can you
    give me some information?\" rather than \"Can you give me a job/internship?\"\r\n\r\n<em>I
    am trying to build up my own personal website</em>\r\nYou might get more and better
    feedback from the folks on Typophile.com if you post a link to your website and
    share it with us.\r\n\r\n<em>what else can I do to get into the scene?</em>\r\nNonprofit
    organizations can always use skilled volunteers. Offer your web-design services
    to cultural groups, charities, religious institutions, and the like."

    folk have heard of opportunities long before they are published anywhere and,
    since it seems you did well in the program, may be willing or able to recommend
    you for a potential opening.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your posts, they have helped me.  Although there are a few things\u2026\r\n\r\nPrevious
    employer and co-workers\u2026I have tried in the past and they were a great help
    with regards to encouraging me to get onto a course and doing as many tutorials
    as I can find, but now I in a different city and my previous job was in a different
    city.  So those contacts are not here.\r\n\r\nI have not finished my site yet,
    so it\u2019s not yet online\u2026still working on it.  When I\u2019m done I will
    put the link up. Bit of a designers block at the moment...need some inspiration.\r\n\r\nWith
    regards to the non-profit organisations\u2026I remember reading somewhere 3 things
    you should say well clear of in web/graphic design, especially for job interviews\u2026religion,
    politics, and controversial topics.  I just don\u2019t want to be in a position
    where the interviewer has the opposite view to the poster/website I have done.
    \ Or is all this nonsense?\r\n\r\nWith regards to my web design teacher\u2026I
    have emailed her\u2026lets see what she says.\r\nI just want to be able to do
    a small body of work so that I have something to show in interviews for paid jobs\u2026but
    I can not apply for those types of jobs as they ask for links to websites I have
    done and I have not done any real ones\u2026the one I did for my course was for
    Moroccan restaurant I made up.  I need to show something real.\r\n\r\nBut do keep
    the comments coming\u2026it really helps.\r\n"

  body: "Are you in school? Is there a department within your school that offers career
    services?\r\n\r\nWhen I was in college, I made friends with the university's web
    designers. Friends of that community still solicit them all the time for freelance
    work and sometimes they give that work out to students who are web designers.\r\n\r\nAs
    PublishingMojo said, network with whomever you can, whenever you can. You may
    not be getting paid or designing the most beautiful websites, but at least you
    can show something to employers and say you worked with actual clients."

  body: "Hi Muneebah,\r\n\r\nTry attending and networking at design related conferences
    and events in your area.  The Make/Think AIGA Design Conference is coming up in
    October - it will be held in Memphis, TN this year.  If you can't make it to that
    try looking online for local non-profit organizations that may need help in that
    department but can't necessarily afford to hire someone.  Here is a link to a
    great resource website specifically for Designers with 0-5 years of experience
    looking for Internships.  [[http://www.idinterns.com]]\r\nHope this helps!"

  body: "Hey again,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments, they do help.\r\n\r\nAs I\u2019m
    new to the site I didn\u2019t realised when I joined you guys are based in the
    US.  I\u2019m from the UK\u2026London to be precise.\r\n\r\nI am not at school
    anymore, I did my GCSES at high school when I was 16, then went to college for
    2 years and did A-levels including art and design, then went to university for
    4 years, I did a years foundation course in art and design, then a degree in three
    dimensional design (product design). \r\n \r\nAfter leaving uni I did a few student
    jobs before landing a job as a homepage / brand executive \u2013 where I briefed
    web designers what I wanted on web pages.  The work came back and I uploaded it
    all onto the site.   It was then that I became interested in web design.  I moved
    to London did a short 6 month diploma in web and graphic design and that\u2019s
    where I am at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe advice about going to design shows is very
    good, I actually very recently went to New designers exhibition.  I exhibited
    with them when I was at uni.  They showcase art and design work from universities
    all over the UK.  When I was there last I was in the product design field, but
    this time I went to the graphic and web design area.  The good thing was it really
    inspired me, the bad thing was it depressed me very much\u2026these students have
    a very very high standard of work therefore the competition is very very tough.
    \ I really wish now that I had done graphic/web design at uni.  Learning everything
    on my own is much harder and I have no one to give comments or direct me.\r\n\r\nThe
    other thing is that all web design courses tend to teach just dream weaver, photoshop,
    flash html and css.  I am proficient in these softwears/languages, but when it
    comes to applying for jobs they want you to have excellent knowledge of  quark,
    indesign, fireworks, illustrator, and the courses don\u2019t tend to offer these
    softwear qualification\u2026where there is a workshop/ course happening they cost
    a bomb and only last 2 days! if that\u2019s not enough employers are also asking
    for a person who not only knows web design and graphic design but also developer
    stuff too (php/java/asp.net/sql/seo) etc\u2026 to cut back on costs because of
    the credit crunch in the UK employers are looking for multi skilled people.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    I\u2019ve taken on work from my brother to do a website for him\u2026just need
    to keep asking family and friends if they need sites doing so that I can build
    up my portfolio. As well as doing tutorials from web design magazines I have subscribed
    to.\r\n\r\nWith regards to asking old colleges for help\u2026I do have a friend
    in web design from my old job, and have asked her to have a look over my CV in
    case that\u2019s where I\u2019m going wrong.\r\n\r\nThe site http://www.idinterns.com
    is really good, it\u2019s a shame its in the US, it would be great if we had one
    here.  Other than that I guess I should look for forums that are UK based, for
    a little more focused advice.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help though, and if there\u2019s
    any more advise in this most frustrating time of my life please do let me know.\r\n\r\nMuneebah\r\n\r\n"
