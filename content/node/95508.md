  body: "Yes, the \u201Cinsert image\u201D seems broken in initial posts (it works,
    with the usual limitations, in comments).\r\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a
    match, but Bulmer sports a similar |R|."

  body: In the QBF filmtype catalogue there is a typeface called Baskerville Adbold
    which features this R and looks like a match otherwise as well.

  body: Atwe, thank you! I really appreciate the effort in looking it up. I had a
    suspicion that a digital version would likely not be available. Much appreciated!
