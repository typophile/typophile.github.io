  thought I'd break the silence as I get more and more entrenched as a freelance designer
  and prepare myself for a rigorous design course in the coming spring (hopefully)
  at a school like OCAD, UCLA, or Parsons (at least, those are the top three I've
  been looking at... will take kindly to all suggestions). I'm from Florida and am
  dying to leave it, but if there's any Floridians out there that think I should stay,
  speak up. It would be nice to meet more creative folk close by.\r\n\r\nYou could
  take a look at my completely unfinished and imperfect portfolio/website <a href=\"http://www.davidboni.net/\">here</a>
  and have a gander at some more work on my Flicker account <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25538071@N04/\">here</a>
  if you're into that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nRight. Thanks for reading. Be seeing you
  on the forums. Hope everyone's weekend was well."

    (and in the summer, stifling, sweaty, and inhumanly inhospitable) Naples.\r\nMy
    advice: go.\r\nNew York and California are unique.\r\nLook, you can get a great
    design education in Miami, I have no doubt. But you'll experience more up north
    or out west.\r\nAs a New Yorker who used to work in the fashion biz, I'm biased
    towards Parsons. You can't re-create an atmosphere like that in another city.\r\n\r\nWelcome
    and best of luck."

  body: "Thanks for the advice, Richard. I've got an uncle that lives near there;
    I think I'm envious of anyone on the West coast simply because you get to see
    the sun set on the ocean more frequently.\r\n\r\nAnd I'll be looking more into
    Parsons\u2014strangely, I never heard of it until I stumbled upon some work a
    designer named Roland Tiangco did for the school's AMT thesis exhibition: [[http://www.rolandtiangco.com/index.php?/project/parsons-amt-thesis-exhibition/]]"
