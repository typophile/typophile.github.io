body: "I am in search of a slab serif typeface that meets the below criteria. So far,
  I've come up empty. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n1.) Suitable
  for extended text (papers, possibly a short book).\r\n\r\n2.) Reasonably clear as
  a screen font under Windows w/ Cleartype\r\n\r\n3.) Available in at least 3 styles
  (reg, bold, ital) and ideally 4 (add bold ital).\r\n\r\n4.) Here's the tough one
  - priced at $20 or less per style.\r\n\r\nWere price not an object, I'd probably
  go with Mokka or Skolar. Typefaces resembling those, at my price point, would be
  great.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

    Silica</a>.\r\n\r\nNot exactly within your budget, but pretty close, is the selection
    of Chaparral fonts offered in<a href=\"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1902\">
    Adobe Type Basics Opentype Edition;</a>, and these come with good glyph coverage,
    such as smallcaps and OSFs.\r\n"
