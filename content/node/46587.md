  - it should be made with only that in mind! It's for a design program for visually
  impaired people. I'd prefer a sans serif although a serif probably would be better...
  \ \r\n\r\nAny suggestions will be a great help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanx \r\n\r\nJsbr"

    typeface would be how it is set--size, colour, composition..."

    credible research to back up any suggestions. I\u2019m not sure that research
    is needed just to select a font for a single publication, though; that\u2019s
    why you\u2019ve come to the experts.\r\n\r\nBut first, what kind of visual impairment?
    Do they just need large type (low acuity), or do they have other disorders?\r\n\r\n\u2014

  body: "Joe is right, this is dangerous ground, so anything we contribute will be
    anecdotal and without scientific foundation.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, if a font
    is legible for text setting at 10pt, then making it larger should be okay. Line-length
    and leading will likely be the gotchas. Assuming the same viewing distance as
    an unimpaired reader, you\u2019d put less words on a line. As for leading? \r\n\r\nApart
    from that the other common sense answer might be to use signage fonts \u2013 so
    your open, humanist sans, might be a good approach. But I\u2019d be nervous about
    these in text settings \u2013 for short passages and headings you should be okay.

    I've heard even more people say (without me asking :-) that [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html|Delicious]]
    does a great job for people who are visual impaired. Maybe Jesper can give it
    a test run.\r\n\r\n"

    here]]. Although it''s meant for children, it''s designed so that the characters
    are easily recognizable and distinguishable from each other. In that sense it
    might also work for people with some form of visual impairment. There are also
    different versions.'
