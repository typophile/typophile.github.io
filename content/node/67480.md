    What is the significance of the name?"

  body: "I think the thing that is most interesting about the design - those outward
    leaning serifs on E/F/L/T - are the very thing that will make good spacing very
    difficult with this font.\r\n\r\nI like the shapes of Y and Z, and S if you can
    work out the kink in the middle."

  body: "In Brazil, moqueca (sound as mokeka) is a typical food prepared with fish
    and vegetables. Comes from state of Espirito Santo (between Rio and Bahia) but
    can be found in all litoranean regions North to Rio.\r\n\r\nInteresting design,
    but I agree that spacing it would be difficult. Your acutes are very deslocated
    to the right. X has very few counterspace."

  body: I love the outward leaning serifs too, but havings serifs on just some of
    your letters makes some words looking a bit disturbing, I think at it when I look
    at "TOCABA".

  body: Some of the characters are a bit too heavy. Like A, R, M, N, X, W - they need
    to be re-adjust. And T is too narrow, I think. But overall it's a good start.
