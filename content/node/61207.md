  have think of something pink , a nice type and maybe play with the type so it looks
  like some scissors , a hair dryer or something related to hairdressing tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nwich
  kind of type would you recommend me ? do you know of ny good logos of hairdressers
  where i could get some inspiration ?  should i write her name in simple sans letters
  or should i go for some script letters that remaind hair ?\r\n\r\n\r\nHer name is
  Irene Aquino , i could play making the A as a scissor but maybe is a bit too used
  allready.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanx any constructive critic is wellcome.\r\n\r\nthanx."

    to what she wants, learn about her personality, how the card will represent her
    and her business. Then a lot of sketches.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dailypoetics/sets/72057594104389710/?page=2\">
