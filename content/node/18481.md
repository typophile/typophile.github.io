  an enlarged image from a videoclip. A friend asked me to find the typeface, but
  after quite some search I could only think that it is a caslon with swashes.\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm very doubting...\r\n\r\ndoes anyone have a clue or idea?...\r\n\r\nso much thanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\ngreetings Matthijs\r\n\r\n(it also reminds me of the old-style-herb
  lubbalin-kind of approach for ITC)"
