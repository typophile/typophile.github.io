  body: Oh the one at the top from stockbucket.  The problem is is that this font
    is going up on a banner and there is too much of a contrast between thin and thick.  This
    makes it difficult for me to please both my employer and the client.  My employer
    likes fonts that go on banners large and bold, but the client really likes this
    one.  Perhaps there is a thicker and bolder font in a similar style to please
    both my employer and the client?

  body: What I ended up doing, although it would be interesting to know an answer
    to this quandry, is that I used Vladimir script but added a stroke to thicken
    up the text, sort of like a faux bolding.  It works, but even then, the text turned
    out a bit small.  Being that it's a script, it still looks elegant and the strokes
    I think gives a playful enough atmosphere as Princess would have.  It would be
    interesting to know if there is a font out there even more suitable for what was
    supposed to be conveyed-a children's birthday banner.
