  target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36321.html</a> <BR>thread&#42;,
  but it was &#34;timed out&#34;. I thought there had to be a month of inactivity
  on a General Discussion thread &#40;which is still too little, as far as I&#39;m
  concerned&#41;, but this hadn&#39;t even been three weeks. What&#39;s the deal with
  such draconian measures to <i>prevent</i> discussion?... <BR> <BR>&#42; Specifically,
  I was going to ask Nathan where the pitchurz were. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    &#40;what would be the point?&#41;! The archiving  <BR>is an automated feature,
    and archives the 60 or what  <BR>oldest threads when a certain number of &#34;live&#34;
    threads  <BR>is reached. I&#39;ve had the same problem in the Type  <BR>Identification
    Board: due to its very heavy traffic,  <BR>some threads have a life span of less
    than two weeks!'
