body: "<strong>I am designing invitations for a wedding, but cannot find any 6x6 inch
  sqaure envelopes. </strong>I've looked through every swatch book I can find. Is
  there a trick to finding square envelopes? I can find them online, but I want them
  to be the same paper as the invites. I am looking for a slight off-white smooth
  paper and am too scared to order cream envelopes off the internet - for fear they
  will be way off color wise. I also need a smaller envelope to match for the RSVP.
  I am leaving the dimensions up in the air, until I find some envelopes, but these
  can't be sqaure.\r\n\r\nAny advice?"

  body: How many invitations will be sent out? If it isn't a large wedding, you could
    have the die made but tell your printer that you will be doing the converting.
    We have done this in the past for clients after a nationwide search (literally)
    for a paper converter to make some custom evenvelopes.

    continue:\r\n\r\n6x6 envelopes are already mass produced so many converters will
    have the die. You just give them the matching stock and - presto!"

    body: ohh... that sounds like an awesome idea. I will ask around because I keep
      finding lovely paper, but hate to settle on the envelopes. The wedding is small,
      only 100 invites will be sent out - so this I can handle. THANK YOU
