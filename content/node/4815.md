body: Hello all, this is my first post here. I stumbled upon this site today and I
  was quite impressed. I havent had a chance to totaly look at everything yet but
  It was really interesting to the progression of some of the identities.  <BR> <BR>Anyways
  I am a high school student, my name is Tom and I am from Toronto, Canada. I am looking
  forward to my experience here :D <BR> <BR>A few friends of my parents who run small
  business and have a tight budget have given me the opportunity to do some small
  design jobs for them. <BR> <BR>I just got one to design a logo for a company that
  sells a variety of different UPS units to deliver uninterupted power protection
  incase the power goes out. they are called &#34;UPS For Less&#34; <BR> <BR>Here
  are my first few ideas, I am having a bit of trouble finding a type face to suit
  this and I am still working on the icon, which is a sheild combined with a power
  symbol. Any help would be much appretiated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36129.jpg"

  body: I like your bottommost shield/icon best - but I think that you would do well
    to have a more rectangular shield shape; the power icon will fill it better. The
    other version of the icon doesn&#39;t read as a shield with a design on it to
    me, at least not without some thought.

    &#40;United Postal Service&#41;. Who remind us on a daily basis that they are
    an international company. Plus you will confuse any potential customer because
    the meaning isn&#39;t clearly stated upfront. Come up with a new name and a tagline
    for the new company. This is just advice '

    be able to use the acronym then - you might have to prove that your industry knows
    the term rather then trying to educate and market a new one - which UPS &#40;courier&#41;
    probably wouldn&#39;t let you do. but yeah definately not the sheild in any case,
    the UPS we know it will come get you. '

    will be able to steer him away from it. <BR> <BR>UPS is an industry standard term,
    and in his feild of business it would not be confused for the shipping service.
    It stands for Uninterupted Power Supply. <BR> <BR>I never saw the United Parcel
    Services logo as a sheild before, but in that case any ideas for something that
    could represent power protection. <BR> <BR>Thanks

    Tho logo has to stand out and catch attention and/maybe in your case remind od
    strong undisturbed flow of power-force-strength. Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>g

  body: Given a sufficiently round type, you could use the power symbol as the U in
    UPS, or you could &#40;with many sans&#41; use it in place of the O in FOR. I&#39;d
    play around with that.  <BR> <BR>As for the name, I don&#39;t think they would
    be in danger. They aren&#39;t in the shipping business, and there are other UPS
    outfits, e.g. <a href="http://www.minutemanups.com/" target="_blank">http://www.minutemanups.com/</a>
    &#40;who use a plug in their logo&#41;. <BR> <BR>However, if United Parcel Service
    does decide to sue them, there will be lots of publicity. So, design a logo you
    would be proud to see on the 6 o&#39;clock news!

    once I finalize them I am going to propose maybe adding a tagline to the logo
    to eliminate confusion with united parcel service. <BR> <BR>Also the typeface
    isnt final, I wanted something that was a bit techy as its for a computer related
