body: "Hi, I absolutely have no clue about typography. I've been lurking here and
  there ([[http://ilovetypography.com/|itc]]) trying to pick up what I can but one
  wall that I keep bumping into that I feel never really gets elaborated upon is finding
  out how, where, & when a particular font is best used for.\r\n\r\nPlenty of times
  I've seen typophiles say on the subject of choosing a font is to choose depending
  on content and audience. What does that mean - what kinds of content & audiences
  are there? More importantly, how or where do you find this info?\r\n\r\nI've also
  read a lot about overused fonts (Helvetica, Arial, and Times) being bastardized
  because it's used in the wrong setting. I'm not exactly sure what that means but
  I'm guessing it's about the medium, that some fonts are designed or best used for
  screen but it may not exactly look as great when in print or in a sign. How does
  one find out what mediums a font was designed for? And what mediums would a font
  still work well at?\r\n\r\nI've also read that some fonts only work for certain
  sizes. That fonts are designed for a particular size(s)? Furthermore, there may
  also be other things to consider like font penetration on devices & similar-looking
  fonts to fall back on, or lacking support on foreign/squiggly characters (not sure
  what the term is!), etc.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing most of the answers will point toward
  using ones eyes. But for one who doesn't know what to look for (me) it will be a
  futile exercise. So I ask you folks here if you could share some your expertise
  and guidelines on using a particular font, if this doesn't exists already. Maybe
  something like this:\r\n\r\n<strong>Font Name:</strong> Superfont\r\n<strong>Designed
  Medium:</strong> Screen\r\n<strong>Works Still on:</strong> Projections\r\n<strong>Designed
  Size:</strong> 16px\r\n<strong>Works at Size Range:</strong> 12px -- 32px\r\n<strong>Pros:</strong>
  95% of net devices have this font\r\n<strong>Cons:</strong> Overused, generic.\r\n<strong>Other:</strong>
  Looks good in headers and in paragraphs. Lacks small caps and bold italic version.
  Interesting history, superman actually designed this!\r\n<em>(Example was pulled
  out of my arse)</em>\r\n\r\nNow I know the danger of a cookie-cutter approach to
  anything but in most cases I believe it would serve as an invaluable learning tool
  for beginners. If not, at the very least, people like me could avoid misusing a
  font everywhere and on anything. :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I was going to say either \"Welcome to hell\" or \"There is no spoon,\" but
    I'm settling on \"Welcome to Typophile.\"\r\n\r\nYour questions are thoughtful
    and intelligent for someone with no background in type. Unfortunately, though,
    your request is elephantine. It's almost 1:00 a.m. where I am, and I have to work
    in the morning, so I'm not going to get too into this, but here's a little to
    get you started...\r\n\r\nJust like in any craft, there are rules of varying importance
    and weight in typography .\r\n\r\n[Quick sidebar clarification: <em>typography</em>
    refers to the functional/aesthetic setting of type; <em>type design</em> is not
    necessarily typography. Rather, it is the design of the letterforms and alphabets
    used by typographers. Not many typographers can masterfully design type, and vice
    versa (but before the sensitive crowd gets too upset, I fully acknowledge there
    are some serious exceptions to that statement). I'm replying to your post more
    from the <em>typographer</em> angle, as my knowledge of <em>type design</em> is
    limited.]\r\n\r\nDepending on the abilities of two, say, typographers with the
    same skill set put to the same task with the same set of tools (<em>e.g.</em>,
    software and fonts), they may construct pages that are markedly different from
    one another in style and feel, yet both function exactly as they need to (or,
    more frequently, not at all).\r\n\r\nWhy? Admittedly general, and in no particular
    order:\r\n\r\n<strong>Personality</strong>\r\n(That is, the personality of the
    typographer <em>and</em> of the typeface(s) used on the project) A typographer
    may personally be more comfortable with a certain face for a kind of project.
    Anyone who has an opinion about \"fonts\" can relate to some more than others,
    and may thus lay out a page using something they are comfortable with. Which leads
    us to:\r\n\r\n<strong>The right tool for the job</strong>\r\nThere's a reason
    United States IRS documents are composed in Helvetica and not in the \"Chiller\"
    font. So, if Helvetica is the perfect banal and transparent face for government
    documents, why is it so elegant and contemporary for branding such as Crate&Barrel
    or edgy and cool for American Apparel? <a href=\"http://www.helveticafilm.com/about.html\">See
    the movie</a> for the answer.\r\n\r\n<strong>Family History</strong>\r\nVarious
    faces fall into different categories: there are genres and sub-genres and Return
    of the Son ofs (Reference? Anyone?) for serifs, sans, displays, texts, scripts,
    and on and on. Each has its developmental place historically, and thus has a \"preferred\"
    application, for various reasons (see \"The right tool for the job,\" above).\r\n\r\nTo
    make matters worse (better), a masterful typographer might be able to justify
    (no pun intended) using an historically inappropriate face for a job, and make
    it work beautifully (see \"Personality,\" above).\r\n\r\n<strong>Variable Interdependence</strong>\r\nAs
    you can see by my few and scattered examples, these factors can interdepend on
    one another, and there are <em>way too many</em> more variables for me to discuss
    here or now.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I understand what you're looking for, and
    I know that I didn't give it to you, but I hope you might have a better understanding
    as to why yours is a difficult request.\r\n\r\n<strong>Resources</strong>\r\nThere's
    more than a handful of fantastic books on typography, and I'm sure others will
    provide you with links galore, but here are some resources for completely backgroundless
    newbies:\r\n<em>Thinking with Type</em>, by Ellen Lupton\r\n<em>Type Desk Reference</em>,
    brand new publication, by Theo Rosendorf\r\n<em>Thinking in Type</em>, by Alex
    White\r\n\r\nI love these books. Lastly, I hesitate to mention (and to not mention)
    a profound contribution to the contemporary type community. Despite it's ironically
    appalling cover, Robert Bringhurst's <em>Elements of Typographic Style</em> is
    considered by most to be the typographer's bible. My hesitation is only because
    you're a newbie. If you catch the bug, and I think you might, then get this book.
    It's the best.\r\n\r\nAw, hell. I guess I'll give it a shot for one of my own
    favorites:\r\nFont Name: Scala Sans\r\nDesigned Medium: Screen (that's kind of
    an odd wording, but I think you mean \"designed on a computer vs. lead vs. wood,
    etc)\r\nWorks Still on: Projections (I don't even know what that means)\r\nDesigned
    Size: ?\r\nWorks at Size Range: Very dynamic. I have successfully set this at
    5 points for \"the fine print,\" and I once saw it breathtakingly set in a banner
    in Hartford that covered the side of an enormous office building (considerably
    larger than a billboard). Awesome.\r\nPros: Clean, fresh, readable, all the stuff
    you'd demand (small caps, multiple weights, etc); OpenType version has sc, expert,
    math, ornaments, and more built in (as it should, but so should deGroot's Thesis
    by now).\r\nCons: I'm sure there must be some...\r\nOther: It's late. I have to
    go sleep now. Good luck, and welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\n"

    questions, at least), I would recommend <em>Stop Stealing Sheep and Find Out How
    Type Works</em>, by Erik Spiekermann and E.M. Ginger. Personally, I prefer the
    <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Stealing-Sheep-Find-Works/dp/0672485435/ref=tmm_pap_title_1\">1st
    edition</a>, but there is also a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Stealing-Sheep-Find-Works/dp/0201703394/ref=tmm_pap_title_sr\">2nd
    edition</a>.\r\n\r\nI also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Essential-Guide-Typography/dp/0823014134/ref=pd_sim_b_9\"><em>Designing
    with Type</em></a>, by James Craig (now in its 5th edition). Also available from
    James Craig: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Typography-Design-James-Craig/dp/0823004511/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_4\"><em>Basic
    Typography: A Design Manual</em></a>.\r\n\r\nI would start with one of these books...
    And then, if you get bitten by the type bug, move on to the ones by Lupton, Rosendorf,
    and White. :-)"

  body: "Hello, Lisle. Welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\nThe first step into type is realizing
    how little you know, so that's out of the way. As a graphic design student, I
    was struck by this realization around my junior year. Lurking here is good, but
    it can be a bit dense. There are some general guidelines, but the devil is in
    the details (along with god, I'm told), so reading up is the best bet.\r\n\r\nBooks
    will give you a good foundation, particularly for use and an overview. Ricardo's
    recommendations match my own. When you're ready for the next level, we'll still
    be here. Also, <em>start learning type history:</em> what typefaces were popular
    during which eras and how they fit into the philosophy that drove their designs.
    The era contributes the \"voice\" of a typeface, because our popular culture often
    has a visual understanding of something before an intellectual one. You can evoke
    a time period or emotional response simply by choosing an archetypal typeface.
    The philosophies that drove their designs are often based in function or emotion,
    which is a good way to match type to subject matter (though not always). This
    is also a great way to find a typeface that defies convention and breaks expectations
    (see Avant Garde's recent revival).\r\n\r\nI find the most informative sources
    are the font makers/sellers themselves, once you've read the basics. <a href=\"http://typography.com/\">Hoefler
    & Frere-Jones</a> do a good job of giving context and usage info on their releases.
    FontShop (by way of the ubiquitous Stephen Coles) has a great <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/\">newsletter
    they send out</a> that often contains concise and helpful descriptions of their
    releases.\r\n\r\nThe arguably best way to figure out what works and what doesn't
    is to start typesetting everything you make. Try a different typeface. Combine
    two for heads and body then take a look. Listen to others' reactions. Tighten
    the margins. Work with the line spacing. Then change the typeface again and see
    what it does in the same setting. Type is tricky because there are different realms
    with different goals. Identifying your overall goal will help. If you're typesetting
    lengthy running text in a novel, your goals are very different from an advertisement
    or a business proposal.\r\n\r\nAlso, find examples of things you like and really
    scrutinize the type being used. Try to describe it. How does it differ from what
    you have available in Word? Use resources like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\">What
    the Font</a> to start identifying type you enjoy. Look for the colophons in books
    and learn what typefaces are used by the pros.\r\n\r\nIn the end, short of going
    to school, exploration (by doing and reading) is the best route. If you've lurked
    Typophile, you know that we rarely agree on things, so while there are general
    guidelines, it all comes down to judgement and experience."

    why do you prefer the 1st edition? (I have the 2nd edition and never held the

    the first edition, and when I leafed through the second one, it seemed to me that
    the design of the pages had become very busy and even distracting. (This came
    up before on Typophile, and someone said that even the design of the first edition
    seemed busy to him! Wish I could find that thread now.) On the other hand, I haven't
    read the second edition -- maybe it's time that I gave it a chance. :-)"
