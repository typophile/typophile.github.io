  need a little ID help... the (fairly) public-domain font Ravenscroft is based on
  an existing design, but for the life of me, I can't remember the name. I need a
  true commercial version for a project I'm working on. If you don't know, Ravenscroft
  was created and available at www.tombsweettomb.com as a \"Haunted Mansion\" font,
  but it's now only available from an aol site (disneyfonts); the \"current\" version
  (I have no idea how old it really is) is PC-Truetype only, and it works like cr*p
  on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nI actually worked on a Fontographer version years ago, then
  found Ravenscroft and ditched my effort. I'll wager I left all me research scans/files
  on that old 68040 mac as well.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thanks... saved my bacon, so to speak, as the client wanted to know where
      they could get the font, and I never intended it to be \"official.\"\r\n\r\nRubens
      is close enough for my immediate crisis, but i have to wonder if there isn't
      another cut of this face out there. While legibility is not a word I would use
      describing either face, Rubens is a little heavy-handed for me personally (serifs
      are shallow, general angularity to the letters like lowercase \"s\", very short
      ascenders - or high x-height). The lowercase \"t\" and \"f\" are almost unreadable.
      \r\n\r\nI know that there is a non-digital version of this, I think as photo
      or metal type, out there somewhere (not that it does me any good on my Mac)...
      guess this is my excuse to unpack my vintage specimen books, as I can picture
      this face (non-condensed) in my favorite, from 1907 or so.\r\n\r\nThe hunt continues!
      Set loose the dogs, jeeves!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ravenscroft was indeed inspired by variations of the analog Rubens typeface.
    It was created by myself and Tim McKenny, in an attempt to emulate the particular
    style used in the signage at Disney's Haunted Mansion attractions. Its current
    'home' is at http://mickeyavenue.com/fonts/ravenscroft/\r\n\r\nThe Wooden Type
    digitization available on MyFonts appears to be based on a rather rough source.
    The only other commonly available digitization I know of is on Dan Solo's Victorian
    Type book/CD.\r\n\r\nThe PC-TrueType version of Ravenscroft should work under
    Mac OS X, I've never noticed any problems. The old Mac version was ported by someone
    else, and I've never used it myself. If you would let me know what kind of trouble
    it's giving you, I might be able to repair or generate a different format."

  body: "In case my first post was missed, I am the co-author of Ravenscroft, and
    can attest that Ravenscroft was based on Rubens, not Macbeth (is there a condensed
    weight of Macbeth?).\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, Rubens was a Victorian-era
    typeface from the 19th century, produced in several weights. Ravenscroft is a
    fairly accurate revival of a condensed weight of Rubens.\r\n\r\nThe version of
    Rubens sold on MyFonts is another independent revival. Unfortunately it seems
    to have been based on a rough source and lacks many of the font's finer details.\r\n\r\nOther
    digital versions of Rubens can be found in the aforementioned Dan X. Solo book/CD
    and an <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/designer3/designer3.11.html\">extra-condensed
    weight</a> from the famously elusive <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html\">Castcraft
    Software</a>.\r\n\r\nScott, if Ravenscroft is not working properly for you on
    Mac OS X, I would be interested to know what specific issues you are having. Even
    if you have reservations about using it for your project, it would be nice to
    improve future versions for Mac users."

    body: "I can't quote the specific problem, as I had it a few months ago... if
      i recall correctly, the \"current\" version of Ravenscroft (1.2) is a Windows
      TrueType download; yes, it _should_ work fine in OS X, and I think it will if
      I install it directly into the System's font folder(s), but FontAgent Pro and
      Linotype's FontExplorer both had difficulty with it -- it would not flag it
      as a \"bad\" or \"corrupted\" font, but the font wouldn't render (choosing it
      from the menu just got you geneva or whatever the default font is). Couldn't
      access/convert to the outlines in Illustrator either. I believe that I got it
      working (after a couple of tries and downloads) in FontAgent Pro, but unfortunately,
      my employer is cheap and we're running FontExplorer on most of the machines
      here (I bought my own copy of FA Pro 'cuz I love it).\r\n\r\nMy workaround at
      the time was to open the TTF in FontLab and regenerate it as an OpenType font
      to install on the four machines that needed it at the time (an old-time circus
      project that Ravenscroft fit well into). Don't worry, I haven't distributed
      it or anything.\r\n\r\nNow we're working on a Style Guide for a major Hollywood
      Studio (name withheld), and as we were putting forth ideas for \"offical\" typefaces,
      Ravenscroft was one of the choices a designer threw in. It _would_ have been
      a great choice (free and all), but the Client Studio in questions is NOT Disney
      -- and they wouldn't appreciate us using a font with Disney logos embedded in
      it, downloaded from \"disneyfonts.com\", etc.\r\n\r\nMy crisis erupted when
      the client asked us where they could get some of the fonts we were using...
      I didn't even know they had _seen_ them, much less decided which one(s) they
      wanted to use. So I had to scramble up an alternative that same day (thanks
      to you all who helped) to cover our butts.\r\n\r\nI agree that (MyFont.com's)
      Rubens is an inferior implementation to yours, but I couldn't in good conscience
      let the Studio use it and discover the Disney connection down the road. It's
      also safer legally to tell licensees to purchase a font for themselves rather
      than download a \"free\" one (there's no way to know wich version they might
      download, and I couldn't find any specific legal/license that applies to Ravenscroft
      -- is it public domain, is it freeware, is it only for personal use...?)\r\n\r\nThanks
      for both the info and the original font... it's very much still in my library.\r\n\r\nHave
      you any plans for an OTF update?\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Scott for sharing your troubleshooting details. I hadn't tried Ravenscroft
    in FontExplorer. I'm wondering if the embedded logos could be causing your grief
    in that area too, since a few of them have tons of compound outlines.\r\n\r\nMy
    plan for the next version of Ravenscroft is to move all of that Disney stuff into
    its own font and finish the rest of the character set. It will definitely be OpenType,
    with stylistic alternates.\r\n\r\nRegarding the license, the only real guideline
    is in the text file where it does say \"for personal use,\" mainly due to the
    trademarked logos within. But nobody reads the text file, and inevitably it's
    been sighted in plenty of commercial work. We don't really mind.\r\n\r\nI once
    licensed a logo-free version of Ravenscroft for a publishing company. If you're
    interested in working something out, please feel free to contact me either through
    <a href=\"http://mickeyavenue.com/fonts/contact/\">my website</a> or my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/2438/contact\">Typophile
