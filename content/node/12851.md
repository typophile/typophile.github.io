  and sells products related to the same field.\r\n\r\nI know some will be automatic
  no's, but the client came back requesting the stroke on the banner/nameplate. So
  i worked up some variations\r\n\r\nDoes the stroke inside the nameplate work?\r\nDoes
  the other variation? Other tips?\r\n\r\nI personally think the marks with the gold
  fill in the middle are much better. (2a, 3a and 3b would be the direction i would
  choose) Any opinions elsewise?\r\n\r\nDon't mind any variations in craft, they aren't
  final. Anything else?\r\n\r\n"

    ones with yellow in the middle are too much yellow

  body: "I prefer version 3b but two points are bothering me \u2013\r\nThe TC looks
    lonely in that space compared to the illustration and the scroll, the emphasis
    seems to be that section of the shield, try reversing the positions of the illustration
    and TC, make the letters work as a monogram, or combine the TC and illustration
    and move the scroll either to the top or bottom.\r\nThe second is the shape of
    the scroll, the topmost corners and sides are too sharp, try curving them, maybe
    introduce a shadow on the shield."

  body: "I prefer the rightmost one in the first row. The white background makes the
    whole logo look much \"cleaner\" than a gold one does. The gold stroke looks good
    on both the shield and the banner. The logo on the whole is approaching excessive
    business (although it isn't there yet), so I would avoid adding any more elements
    or embelleshments.\r\n\r\nThe <em>TC</em> does look a little forlorn. It could
    be enlarged a bit, and maybe even redesigned. For example, putting the letters
    on the same baseline might allow you to enlarge them both while avoiding having
    to crowd the margins <em>too</em> much.\r\n\r\nOr you could redraw the <em>T</em>
    and <em>C</em> glyphs so that they fit the form of the shield somewhat. I'm thinking
    something vaguely reminiscent of the Superman logo (but not obviously so).\r\n\r\nJust
    a couple of ideas to explore."

  body: 'I''d replace TC with "Cleaning". You know where you live. Is your skyline
    drawing of buildings one of the Twin Cities? It seems rather generic. I would
    loose the shield and make the buildings work with just the banner and add Cleaning
    below the banner. The shield has become almost more important than the name and
    what they do. '

  body: "#4 -- 1st column, 2nd row. The name of the company pops first for me and
    relegates the secondard information as well as shutting down the TC a little bit.
    \r\n\r\n#3 -- 3rd column, 2nd row. I don't think this one works because the TC
    is the first thing I read. Having the company name smaller and in black pushes
    it even further to the background. \r\n\r\nI like the way you have yellow peaking
    from the back side of the banner in #7. And, I like the banner in #6 without the
    decoration."

  body: Maybe it's just me, but I instantly thought of this having something to do
    with a guitar company-- it looks just like a guitar pick. I don't know if that
    really matters, but a logo should represent the business the best it can and be
    memorable at that; so if it makes people think of something totally different,
    you might want to try a new shape.

  body: "Dan, wing - I added a jpeg in my first post that has the \"pick\" or shield
    removed. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI didn't come across the shield in exploration
    of the ideas. My client was somewhat adamant about including something of the
    sort and is kind of backwards when working on this project. \r\n\r\nChalk it up
    to inexperience on both our behalf, but i'm working on helping them see the larger
    picture. Remember they don't see pretty flowers in a field, they see dollar signs.
    Frustrating, but hopefully more smooth in the future.\r\n\r\n"

    You need to add either the word Cleaning or a tag line. Look at your logo as if
    a visitor from Manhattan just came to your city and ask  the question would they
    know this was a cleaning company.

  body: "Of the options presented so far, I think 2a is the strongest candidate. Making
    the banner white allows it to rise to the foreground. The yellow shield then sets
    nicely into the background, giving the parts of the complex logo some hierarchy.\r\n\r\nAnother
    reason to vote for 2a is that it has fewer contours. I prefer that simplicity,
    and it will also be better if the client ever needs cut vinyl for banners or vehicle
    decals.\r\n\r\nMostly, I like shield logos, but the one problem with placing the
    company's name in the banner is that it is relatively small and difficult to read.
    It's a challenging problem to solve. I understand from your original post that
    you didn't have complete freedom. It's probably too late to make any big changes,
    but here's a link to a shield logo that avoids the type size problem. (The UPS
    shield is a good example too.)\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.cricketzone.com/upload/logo/australia.jpg\">Cricket

    know if there''s any negotiating room on that though. '
