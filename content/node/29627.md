  Martin's.\r\n\r\nI am interested in furthering an investigation into the creation
  of new letterforms, from the image of existing typefaces. I want to define an additive
  (almost fluid and open ended) process for the production of such letterforms.\r\n\r\nAn
  example of such:\r\nhttp://matthewcroft.co.uk/archive/ex0016.html\r\nhttp://matthewcroft.co.uk/archive/ex0015.html\r\n\r\nIn
  simple terms I want to take existing letterforms, systematically break them to pieces,
  and then put them back together again. \r\n\r\nI want to understand the basic visual
  elements of typographic forms, and how we consciously, and unconsciously perceive
  them. I\u2019m interested in gestalt theory. I want to relate this to the creation
  of new typographic forms.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for a mentor for my final major
  project, and I require help in finding someone suitable. While I know of many type
  designers, I\u2019m not sure specifically who I should contact, or who in particular
  would be interested in my work.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any advice I would appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMatt\r\nwww.matthewcroft.co.uk\r\n"

    I'm not sure if there's enough there that one can make a thesis out of."

      help but I'm looking for someone further afield - within the industry - who
      would be interested in my work - and would be able to give me guidance.\r\n\r\nI
      intend to investigate the ways in which we choose to create letterforms - and
      attempt to offer new possibilities. I am confident this will be enough to work
      with."
