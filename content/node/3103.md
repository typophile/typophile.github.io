  body: Are you using the same file on both computers? Maybe you have a file version
    with bad bmps in one computer and one with good bmps on the other. <BR> <BR>Try
    to use the file that looks ok on both computers.

  body: I don&#39;t think that BMPs matter on a PC with W2K or WP, Hector. Do the
    letters look like garbage in every application under XP, Jason? Or is it only
    a particular few?

  body: Hector,  <BR>I started out with the, I started using a PS font.  I then bought
    a new TrueType font to see if that made a difference, and that made it worst.  So
    I know the file is good.   <BR> <BR>Nathan,  <BR>They look bad on MS Word, and

    <BR>It also might be interesting to see how Helvetica looks as the text on your
    desktop &#40;icons, menus, etc.&#41; - although I&#39;d assume you&#39;d have
    the same problems you&#39;re having in Microsoft applications. <BR> <BR>Also,
    is your Office package the same version on both machines? E.e., are you running
    Office XP on both? Or Office 2000 on one, and Office XP on the other.'
