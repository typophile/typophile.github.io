  body: Many of these college shirts and gear are made with manufactured letters that
    didn't necessarily come from a font. That said, there are <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/collegiate_athletics/">many
    fonts in this genre</a>.

  body: "Hi Stephen, thanks for the reply.  I'm surprised that they're not normally
    fonts that are in use.  I'm asking about this particular image on behalf of someone
    else, so wasn't aware that Franklin & Marshall (in this case) is a fashion brand,
    so I'm guessing in this case it could well be a font.  I've got something close
    for my friend, so hopefully as they're usually quite generic, it'll be ok.\r\n\r\nSimon."

  body: "Eliason, I know it's a college, but It's also a line of fashion clothing,
    which is the reason i said \r\n\r\n'...so wasn\u2019t aware that Franklin & Marshall

  body: Oh, I see now. I wasn't aware of the [[http://www.franklinandmarshall.com/|Italian
    clothing company]] either (and am still puzzled about the relationship between
    it and the U.S. college...)
