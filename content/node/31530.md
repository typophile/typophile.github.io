  the font/fonts that have influenced/comprised the following logos:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Van_den_Bosch_6157.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nigeria_Airways_2_4074.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nigeria_Airways_1_4579.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ICI_Petrol_5810.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dan-Air_London_2_5390.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dan-Air_London_3762.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Boeing_5726.png]\r\n\r\nHere
  were some initial thoughts from the two previous posts (www.typophile.com/node/17379,
  www.typophile.com/node/16442)\r\n\r\nSneakers\r\nRadiant\r\nModula Bold/Modularity\r\nAntique
  Olive\r\nBullet\r\nCA Magic Hour (closest yet)\r\nSomething by Karl Gerstner?\r\n\"It
  may be an older proprietary font for a signmaking device like the Gerber SignMaker.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone?"
