    Brokenscript</a>.

  body: "The two closest typefaces I can think of would be Verona (Stephenson Blake,
    1948 - but based upon a 1904 typeface) and Motto (Morris Fuller Benton, 1915).\r\n\r\nVerona
    is the best, but the only digital version I'm aware of was made by Mike Allard
    back in 1992. His fonts are <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/denada/dn1.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">collected at TypOasis</a>. Unfortunately, when he sent his fonts
    to TypOasis, he seems to have forgotten his version of Verona - which he called
    RomeoDN (\"I think that\u2019s all I've released... I haven\u2019t been keeping
    good track!\").\r\n\r\nI'll send a copy of RomeoDN to Petra, who owns TypOasis.
    Hopefully, it will appear there before long.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions of
    Motto that I'm aware of. One is <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Paul Lloyd's</a> Queen Empress. The other was digitized by Dan
    Solo and is available as Motto on the Dover <a href=\"http://store.doverpublications.com/048699502x.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">24 Calligraphic Display Fonts CD</a>.\r\n\r\nLastly, there's
    Ray Larabie's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/\" target=\"_blank\">Mikadan</a>.
    This is sort of a hybrid of the two typefaces. The advantages are that Mikadan
    is technically better made than the rest and more readily available."

    to see other typefaces that you were not aware of.\r\n\r\nI ended up using Clairvaux
    with a very slight modification.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\ngln"
