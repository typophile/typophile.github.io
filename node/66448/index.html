  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I’m designing a book (cover and inside) for a friend. It is WW2 shipwreck story, and the author really wants to emphasise authenticity. I thought using a font that was usual for newspapers in that era (at least for the cover, but maybe through the book as well) could be a way to convey this authenticity.</p>
<p>I have some scans of newspapers clippings which I put through WhatTheFont. (I’m a novice graphic designer, so my type history probably isn’t as good as it should be!). I don’t know how accurate WhatTheFont is, and maybe they don’t even exist in digital versions. Also, communication is the main goal here, so if I can find a good font that is close enough for the target audience to recognise it I would be happy with that as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are the fonts that WhatTheFont suggested:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking at it, it to me seems a bit like a modern serif like Didot, but much more sturdier and less delicate. I was thinking of going with some variant of Century. If that is indeed a good idea, which is the best cut to go by (for headlines), and are there fonts that work well with this that I can use to set the body text?  I see Adobe has 2 version of Century (Old Style and Expanded) which are described as good text-fonts.</p>
<p>These are probably all stupid questions, but I would appreciate any help!</p>
<p>I’m sorry if this one belongs more in design that Type ID. Wasn’t sure where to put it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Authenticity is a tricky thing. You have to consider the difference between what fonts were actually used in the 1940s versus what fonts people <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were used at that time - possibly pretty close, but possibly quite different.</p>
<p>So I might actually look more at things that people remember seeing regularly about the 40s - not fonts, but buildings, cars, etc. From there I would try to find fonts that evoke those visual ideas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when it comes to choosing a text face for the body of the book, there&rsquo;s a severe limit to how stylistically relevant that era&rsquo;s fonts are in conveying that era <!-- raw HTML omitted -->today<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Text works on a very &ldquo;detached&rdquo; level.</p>
