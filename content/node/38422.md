    don\u2019t know..\r\n\r\nIts Caslon No 540.\r\nThe a, f and above all the e differs
    (its much better an elegant in 540!)\r\nthe right top bowl (an example) of the
    e is much smaller than the one on the left. (not so in LTC version)\r\nAlso the
    a is straight at the end of the line on the top right.\r\n\r\nCompare your scan
    to the screenshot that I made from the LTC Link!\r\nLook also the f...\r\n\r\nStefan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-1_4477.gif]"
