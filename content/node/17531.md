  body: "Looks a lot like Benguiat Frisky that has been slanted (also has the U with
    stem). The problem is that there were hundreds of variations of almost identical
    brush sign lettering scripts that were film types. Some of them have been digitized.
    They all have very similar S, C, and R shapes, suggesting the same artist, or
    at least an effort to use a consistent style. The variations are in stroke thickness,
    slant, and a few minor details, like the U stem. You can see suggestions of this
    variety in the Solotype Catalog. I have a German script book that shows dozens
    of them. The A, B & C names are printed styles, the H, I and J, K and L names
    are somewhat more script-like (at least in the lower case letters). It shows Jefferson
    with alternate characters that look very close to the posted sample. Another called
    Jupiter looks like a vertical version of this sample too. They are all so close.\r\n\r\n-
