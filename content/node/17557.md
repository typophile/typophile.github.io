body: "In the process of doing a little research on intellectual property rights,
  I came across an interesting statistic: it is estimated that as much as 30% of all
  current economic activity in the USA is traffic in intellectual property of one
  kind or another.\r\n\r\nThose among us who design and sell licenses for typefaces
  are part of that 30% of IP entrepreneurs. As such, our assets\u2014our collections
  of typefaces\u2014have a cash value apart from the income they generate. So, it
  would seem that we are somewhat wealthier than we might have imagined. The problem
  is, how do we determine the value of a typeface or collection of typefaces?\r\n"

    people are willing to pay. Perhaps, like Van Gogh, it will only show value after
    we are dead? :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
