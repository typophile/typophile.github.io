		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I never implied that good design didn't matter. What I challenge is the notion that changes in typeface design can significantly improve on what we already do so well: read text. There are plenty of other reasons to design new text typefaces and to design them well, but to pretend that we're chasing some elusive readability is, as I've said before, to willfully ignore the daily reading experience of many hundreds of miliions of people reading a great diversity of writing systems under incredibly diverse and often adverse conditions. Human beings are better at reading than any improvement at the type design level can significantly affect. If you really cared about readability, you wouldn't be talking about type design at all: you'd be talking about page layout, printing and screen technologies, and other things that do have a significant impact on readability. Readability at the type design level is the base prerequisite, not an achievement.</div>

The line between the cognitive acts of text recognition and of understanding is a porous one, and 'reading' understood in toto involves both, but the impact of random words on reading speed has to do with our ability to make sense of the text, not our ability to recognise words. In most of the discussions of readability among typographers and type designers, the comprehensive aspect is ignored, since the professional obsession is with the cognitive act of text recognition. Introducing the comprehensive aspect of reading further diminishes the relative impact of type design, since it is obvious that good writing is more important than a good typeface.</div>

So it's a matter of context, and a good craftsman needs to be very concerned with the smallest of gains - they are &quot;significant&quot; to him, as a person creating quality objects, if for no other reason than because that justifies his existence, because it makes him happy. It is in the context of our individuality that any of this is &quot;significant&quot; - otherwise there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extremely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> few really &quot;significant&quot; reasons to make new fonts. Plus that effort is usually better spent elsewhere anyway! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Was it &quot;significant&quot; to use an esoteric pen to make SBL Hebrew*? Who the hell would have noticed any difference? And then you claim &quot;enhanced dissimilation between similar Hebrew letters&quot;, but when needed you say it doesn't matter? And then you put the top-right spur on the final-kaf anyway, even though that's exactly opposite of the claim! Only the most conservative fonts -the ones that don't worry about dissimilation- do that. I honestly don't know what to think about the aggregate of your opinions on functionality. It really seems that you're just giving people what they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->expect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, depending on context. Sure, expectation is part of functionality too, but there has to be an overall rhyme and reason, at least on the personal level - otherwise it's just reactionary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Although when it seems necessary you tend to claim that the pen didn't influence the result&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And then I have to repeat this yet again, apprently: There is a difference between what people think they can read comfortably versus what they can read comfortably for extended periods, without even realizing. It is in the latter arena that a good craftsman is most concerned. It is in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->promotion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of efficiency, not the assumption of its irrelevance, that good design is best expressed. People don't read &quot;fast enough&quot; [partly] because of bad typography (and type), not because they can't read any faster. That's why using a serif font for a book matters for example. They can read sans just fine, so why not use sans for books? Because the more you push the limits of performace, the more the supposedly &quot;insignificant&quot; things matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you'd be talking about page layout <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I don't like page layout. Get it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's like me telling you: If you're really concerned about conveying information to people (the main point of typography), then dedicate your life to the publishing and distribution of books - and websites! Or maybe you should be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> book? And since conveying information to people is intended to help them, I might propose that you forget typography entirely, and concentrate on what the bulk of the human population is severly lacking and truly needs: not books, but food and decency!! Who was more significant, Claude Garamont or Rachel Corrie? Or Mother Teresa?! Who gives a crap about Garamont. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But in order to propose such things I would need to ignore what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> need out of life - what is in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->your nature<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And I will not do that - because it doesn't make sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Some typefaces model the transition from the horizontal to the vertical on the dalet (spurred) others on the resh (rounded), a few use a hybrid approach. Zvi Narkiss developed a neo-Sepharidic style that tends to favour the rounded form, and I admire his types very much, but in SBL Hebrew I decided to follow a more traditionally typographic, less cursive form. User expectation is one consideration, yes, because the users are Biblical scholars most of whom are familiar with only one or two other Hebrew typefaces (shifting from an 19th century Ashkenazic style to a Sephardic one was enough of a shock for some of them when they first saw SBL Hebrew). However, the other functional consideration &ndash; and this is something that should be right up your street &ndash; is that more words in the Biblical text end in resh than in dalet, therefore it seems  more important to distinguish the final kaf from resh than from dalet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; the distinction between legibility <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; and readability is not clear enough <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, it's confusing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Legibility&quot; has a (relatively) focused meaning, concerning the decipherability of individual glyphs; but readability is over-loaded*, with at least three different meanings: to most poeple it refers to the textual content, as in text that's written so as to be easily understood; to most typographers it refers to the page layout, paragraph attributes like good leading, linebreaks, etc.; and the third -most esoteric and controversial, but I feel most impotant to the context of type design- meaning concerns the font itself: the way in which a font promotes decipherment of boumas - different than the decipherment of individual letters. So for example a sans is more legible but less readable than a serif font; and tight letterspacing helps readability but reduces legibility. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Such over-loading is certainly inconvenient, but it's common, and generally context -which is always there- focuses the meaning quite well. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; if you want to justify your existence by obsessing about &hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK, but I don't see how it's any less &quot;significant&quot; than what you choose to focus on. In the context of the world, they're really about the same. Does my preoccupation with reintroducing readability (in tandem with authenticity, in this case) into Armenian less significant that the way you choose to worry about what kind of pen to use for SBL Hebrew? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; it is far from clear from your typical pronouncements <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, you have a point, and I'm slowly learning to tame my insistence that every other type designer worry [as much] about readability - it doesn't make sense. On the other hand, I think I will always get annoyed when a type designer claims that readability simply doesn't matter outright, and (to a lesser extent) when a user doesn't appreciate the difference between a designer who cares about fine-tuning readability and one who doesn't. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I don't think it's &quot;obsessive&quot;, because I know that it's just one factor - which is the reason for example that some glyphs in Patria (like the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot;) have intentionally sub-optimal readability, to promote the &quot;robust&quot; character of the face. And like I've said before, one reason I drone on about readability is that so few other people do, and so many other people want it not to matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you would prefer to confuse the final kaf with the resh rather than with the dalet? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I actually don't know enough myself (what are the relative frequencies, especially wrt position?), I'm actually mostly referring to what &quot;native&quot; Hebrew designers (who have an innate linguistic sensitivity that we don't) are doing: it's not just one Narkiss font - the font in the Unicode table, Friedlaender's popular Hadassah of the late 50s, and every single Hebrew font in Bukvaraz*, with the highly notable exception of the hyper-conservative Nathan, uses the &quot;soft-corner&quot; form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Even the super-blocky Atzmaut. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And considering you're such a good researcher, I have to think that you knew about this general trend, but you either thought it's wrong, or you thought that in this case the spurred form makes more sense. Both could be valid, but the second one simply doesn't jibe with dissimilitude (as far as I can tell), which in turn doesn't jibe with what you've said in this thread! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The distinguishing feature of the final kaf is its descender <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the descender space is so weak in Hebrew - it doesn't seem safe to rely on it. But it depends -again- on the difference between legibility and readability. Sure, when you give a person many seconds to decide what a glyph is, there's no problem - there almost never is. But there are much more severe requirements of decipherability during high-speed immersive reading. Just like how an &quot;rn&quot; can be read as an &quot;m&quot; in English text - but only during immersion. And this is also why typos go unnoticed so frequently. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I decided to follow a more traditionally typographic, less cursive form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right. And my point is that to me it seems to have been at the expense of the &quot;dissimilitude&quot; that you claim. My impression is that this conservatism was the deciding factor, irrespective of dissimilitude, linguistics, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But really, what I mind most isn't that you're conservative, it isn't that you claim &quot;dissimilitide&quot;, and it isn't that you're saying it doesn't matter anyway - it's the confluence of all three!  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, I'm really not trying to discredit you in toto, I just want to point out what I see as the flaw in the aggregate opinion/action. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; more words in the Biblical text end in resh than in dalet <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, this would be significant - and it would be quite a nice refinement - as well as an endorsement for linguistic analysis!

However, modern Hebrew distinguishes tense in a regular way, and I don't how this is done or what impact it might have on word endings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't rely on writing instruments to make any font. In the case of SBL Hebrew, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unusually<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I began the design process by making letters with a broadnib. This wasn't designing per se, this was research on how the steep ductus of Middle Eastern scripts affects the contrast pattern of individual letters in specific writing styles. As I explained during my ATypI presentation on the subject, I think it is important to understand a script within a cultural and historical context, and the best way to understand a script is to write it as it has been written. It happened, at the time, that I didn't have a broadnib pen with the properly angled nib, so I just used a typical broadbnib calligraphy pen.

As I've explained several times in the past, I design my types entirely onscreen. If I sketch on paper, with outlines, shading, a nib, or any other method, it is only to explore ideas about form. I suppose there might be someone out there who could actually produce the forms of SBL Hebrew, with their various non-chirographic adjustments of weight and terminal, with a broadnib pen. I couldn't. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, my point is that relying on a particular writing instrument to make a font is no less esoteric than worrying about readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indeed, and there is nothing wrong with esoterica, especially not in this business.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, you have frequently in the past insulted other type designers for failing to accept your insistence on readability as the only serious and worthy approach to their craft. On Typophile and the ATypI list, and presumably elsewhere, you have been scathing about 'creativity', 'artistes', etc. It is to this that I was alluding and objecting, not because I'm a champion of romantic creation or artistry, but because my own interest in readability leads me to different conclusions from yours. You've put typeface readability on a pedestal, while I think it belongs in the foundation, where it can do most good. What we build on top of that foundation is cultural. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm really not looking for a fight. I'm trying to figure out why you keep picking on my SBL Hebrew font (last time, you even used your favourite phrase: 'fatal flaw'), when numerous people &ndash; the intended users of the font &ndash;, who know a lot more about Biblical Hebrew than either you or I, have described it as the best Hebrew font they have ever used. I suggest you conduct a survey of the printing of critical editions of the Hebrew Bible, as I have. Then you'll see just how significant is the improvement in letter differentiation between SBL Hebrew and the typefaces that Biblical Scholars have been working with for more than 100 years.</div>

I'd observed the much greater incidence of word-terminal resh while examining various editions. Actually, I was surprised by how high the distribution of terminal dalet is in Eli's stats: I would have guessed that it was even lower. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, I've just completed another Hebrew typeface design that is in many respects less traditional than SBL Hebrew, but using some of the same techniques for letter differentiation. Initial response from Hebrew readers has been very positive. I pursue advancement in typeface design as cumulative effort. One could spend years thinking and talking about the radical breakthrough that one intends to make, endlessly tuning the same typeface, or would could design and release a body of work.</div>

Readability is naturally important. Such as tea, you drink tea, you don't eat tea. Maybe the English do, they like it strong. We should assume that tea is to be drunk, we should take that for granted.  Tea has other qualities that are of more interest. It is these other qualities that are of importance, the cultural, the serving, the ceremony. Little need to be said that you can drink tea. If that were not the case</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That data is very nice - thank you. And it seems to support giving a spur to the final-kaf, at least for a font specifically for Biblical Hebrew. On the other hand (and especially if you believe Larson :-), overall frequency data would be important too, like if dalet is more frequent than resh overall. Also, I'd be interested to find out if general Hebrew text is different. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I don't want to divert from my main point: this sort of analysis is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doubly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &quot;insignificant&quot;, no? :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You really can't say readability is minutia and then spend so much effort analyzing dissimilation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; you have frequently in the past insulted other type designers <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm frankly tired of the whining. I've been insulted 10 times more than any of you, but I don't allow that to derail the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->content<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You're not going to get me to follow your particular shallow interpretation of how people should behave - so please just move on. And most of all, don't use my &quot;bad behavior&quot; as a proxy target, as an excuse for what you're <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pissed about: my ideas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the only serious and worthy approach to their craft. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've never said such a thing - that would be inhuman. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand, I certainly have a problem with people who value their own formal expression more than the needs of users. And I'm not the only one with this complaint, simply the most vocal one, and the one who doesn't believe in your rules of social behavior and hence is the most convenient target. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I'm trying to figure out why you keep picking on my SBL Hebrew font <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here you're either halucinating, or my memory is failing me in a way it almost never does. I've only said good things about SBL Hebrew - this complaint about the final-kaf is the only negative thing I've said about it, and it's minor* - certainly &quot;fatal flaw&quot; is way off. The only really bad design you've made (in fact it wasn't even you who made it!) is the Georgian component of Sylfaen: its cartoonish proportions make it indeed fatally flawed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as a text face<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, while its Latin part is very much a text face**. Overall I think your work is very solid, if too conventional. Sort of like the Slimbach of the non-Latin world. To whom it may concern: take that as an insult if that turns you on - but it's not one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Plus I might even admit it was an incorrect opinion, pending more data and thought. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->** And I understand that there were other attenuating circumstances: Dumbadze passed away during its development, and it was never supposed to actually be released. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I was surprised by how high the distribution of terminal dalet is in Eli's stats <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's normal: anecdotal observation typically exagerates the empirical &quot;truth&quot;, possibly in order to better notice things and remember them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; I pursue advancement in typeface design as cumulative effort. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
