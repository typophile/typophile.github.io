  Kitsun\xE9 logo. (It's a French-based clothing and music label.)\r\nThe letters
  have a high contrast (thick/thin strokes), kind of like a didone type but it has
  no serifs.\r\nDoes anyone know what this font is or know of similar ones?\r\nThank
  you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Maison-Kitsune_logo_2013-02-185121d5b9405d97-54475353_6671.jpg]"

    to be as close as possible to original, the \"best\" would probably be to chop
    off serifs from a [[http://myfonts.us/td-vfz5vw|Didot]], obviously stated by the
