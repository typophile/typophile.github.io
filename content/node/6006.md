  I chose The Invention of the Alphabet. Any thoughts on how this is going?  <BR>

  body: It&#39;s a lovely poster, but it does little to visually suggest the invention
    of the alphabet--I would dig a little deeper in the history books. What kind of
    graphic forms contributed to the invention of the alphabet? <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: I&#39;ll second that. It&#39;s very nice but I don&#39;t see the history.
    Also, I don&#39;t think there is any such thing as &#34;the invention of the alphabet.&#34;
    It was a long evolution.
