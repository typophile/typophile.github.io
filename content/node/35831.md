    like $1500, give or take. As beautiful as it may be, and as good as his poetry
    allegedly is, it seems a bit snooty to me.\r\n\r\nElitist is the word that I will
    use. This is not to bring down Bringhurst as a person, but I remember a woman
    who was staring lovingly at one of his books and said sadly, \"That's not the
    kind of book for me.\" We both knew what she meant. I was sad too, because it
    wasn't the kind of book for me either.\r\n\r\nHis books are all printed in limited
    editions, using custom designed typefaces digital AND metal, using only the finest
    papers and inks. \r\n\r\nThey are works of art, and are not really meant to be
    read.\r\n\r\nBut in my opinion, that defeats the whole damn purpose. "

    with fine presses. I recently attended a lecture of his and it was sheer poetry.
    The man has a gift.\r\n\r\nFine press editions are often more seen as the work
    of the printer-publisher. But it is a wrong assumption that such books are not
    to be read. It's just that they cost a lot to own. There isn't much one can do
    to keep down the costs of such books, it really has nothing to do with snobbery
    or elitism. Simply the cost of producing a well crafted book with high quality
    materials. \r\n\r\nA book I did a some years back cost $23,000 just for materials.
    Divide that by the possible number of books that can be produced (100 to 200).
    And add two years worth of labor. I could have bought a car with that money.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nThe

  body: "The problem likely begins with the fact that the bulk of Bringhurst's poetry
    has been published by small Canadian presses, and, as noted above, many of those
    books are out of print (I'm talking strictly about his poetry here). There is
    some cross-over, of course: for example, his <em><a href=\"http://www.gaspereau.com/1894031660.shtml\"
    target=\"_blank\">Ursa Major</a></em> is a book of poetry (of sorts) that he also
    designed with Andrew Steeves at Gaspereau Press (and for which he received an
    Alcuin award [Canada's national book design awards]), and it's still available
    at a regular trade price. A few of his other books of poetry are still available
    on back-lists from various Canadian publishers, but, as above, the bulk of it
    is out of print. The argument above about his books being out of reach (due to
    price) really doesn't apply to the bulk of his poetry, much of which was published
    <em>long</em> before he wrote <em>ETS</em>; the problem is simply that they're
    out of print and hard to track down. \r\n\r\nAs for the expensive things, his
    most recent projects such as the Koch edition of <em><a href=\"http://www.peterkochprinters.com/show.php?bookid=3\"
    target=\"_blank\">Parmenedes</a></em> or the elaborate <em><a href=\"http://www.centerforbookarts.org/bookstore/newworldsuite.asp\"
    target=\"_blank\">New World Suite</a></em> are really exceptions, and are designed
    and produced as fine-press projects that are not really meant for a strictly reader-audience.
    Then there <em>are</em> a few poetry collections that are also out reach due to
    cost and limited release (such as Barbarian Press' edition of <em>The Blue Roofs
    of Japan</em>, or Ninja Press' edition of <em>The Book of Silences</em>), but
    there are also plenty of basic trade editions of his work, many of which are listed

    copies -- very lucky. In fact, it's a bit like fonts.\r\n\r\nBecause words are
    particularly important in poetry, and you are meant to dwell on them, the type
    requires more attention than in other material, as everyone who publishes poetry
    knows. An astonishing amount of poetry is still published, expensively, today,
    on letterpress using metal Bembo, simply because there aren't any digital alternatives
    that look as good in poetry.\r\n\r\nNot to say that there haven't been great poetry
    books published in other ways, for example offset from a typewriter -- . But that
    wouldn't be appropriate for Bringhurst -- who probably, given his interest in
    digital type, wouldn't go the metal route -- I don't know what his current thinking
    is on that particular issue, it would be interesting to find out.\r\n\r\nFrankly,
    I'm amazed that anything Bringhurst does is finally open to criticism. I and some
    others were pilloried for doing that a few years ago!\r\n\r\nBy the way, what's
    so bad about spending $100 for a book? If you think that's a lot, maybe your priorities
    are wrong, because no matter how poor you are, $100 is not that very much money.
    It's not like you're being asked to choose between a book and a car. That said,
    I don't myself spend a lot on books, though I would if I could!\r\n\r\nThe curious
    thing about the tight, impoverished poetry world is this: a few years ago, Poetry
    Magazine was given $90 million in someone's will, a meteoric, absolutely unprecedented
    event in the entire history of poetry. I would have thought the result would,
    could, have been, a lot of great and beautiful subsidized poetry publishing: exquisite
    books that could sell for a very few dollars. Has any of this happened? What _is_
