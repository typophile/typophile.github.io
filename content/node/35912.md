body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if any of you could suggest a sans-serif font
  that has a 120\xBA angle where the arm meets the leg of the capital letter 'K'  (what
  is that part called, the knee? [I looked around and couldn't find the name of that
  particular part of the anatomy\u2026])?\r\n\r\nThanks to anyone who can decipher
  my criptic writings and can give me a couple of ideas.\r\n\r\nYou guys rock.\r\n\r\n-Adam"

  body: "Heh. I need a few more letters to go with the K. That is slightly out of
    my scope at this moment. It is important that the K has this feature though.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the suggestion!\r\n\r\n-Adam"

  body: "I would guess that most 'K's have an angle between 90 and 135 degrees. I'd
    suggest taking an existing font and modifying the 'K' while keeping the other
    letters the same.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Yeah, that just whacks out the proportions of the letter and the others don't
    match up anymore, but it was worth a try!\r\n\r\n-Adam"
