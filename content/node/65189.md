  body: "Yes, the LU pair, as you have it now, is too tight. You should look at the
    entire letter, not just the top half, when spacing.\r\nThe word spacing is far
    too loose as well.\r\nIt might be easier to work at a small size.\r\nI'm not convinced
    by the larger rounded corners on the L either. Seems antithetic to the rest of
    it."

    the rest of the letters as you wrote but it solved a problem with the L U combo,
    well almost but it does not work. I will go to work on the spacing and L and post
    the results here.\r\n\r\nDo you have any comments on the thoughts behind the logo
    design?\r\n\r\nDoes it signal fashion?\r\n\r\nIf so, where in the segment would
    you place it?\r\n\r\nThank you for your thoughts!"

  body: "Maybe it's just my eyes, but that crossbar on A looks too thick.\r\nI think
    the optimal spacing lies somewhere in between the options you're presenting. The
    balance you're after should also refer to a balance between white space within
    letters and white space between letters."

    this for women who deliver on the way to the hospital?  ;-)\r\n\r\nGimme some
    floriation. Or at least a tendril.\r\n\r\nAlso: you might be able to do something
    with the \"A\" to evoke pregnancy. Maybe replace the bar with a bullet?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Huh, definitely make it rounder and warmer. And possibly less heavy, and
    maybe also less monoline. To me this seems decidedly, sturdily masculine \u2013
    \ and that really can't be what you want. :-) \r\nI think you need type that can
    communicate both warmth and femininity besides the things you list. Dunno, maybe
    something in the general direction of Cocon? (Maybe sans the pointiness though.)"

  body: "Thank you all for taking time and giving me feed back. \r\n\r\nEliason, you
    are right about the crossbar on the A. I used the same thickness as on the R,
    logic instead of feeling.. Looks much better slightly thinner. I'm working on
    the \"in between\" spacing (attached) and I think it works better as you suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince
    the brand will be launched extremly fast I think it's important to signal fashion.
    I have researched the brands that the target group buy when they are not pregnant
    and these brands use either the \"Didot style\" or the \"bold sans style\" in
    their logos. The Lulu clothes themself are more in the bold sans category design
    wise (marc jacobs, helmut lang, jil sander).\r\n\r\nI really want to avoid tendrils
    and floriation, thats not what I want to go for. The photos, hang tags etc will
    deliver the femininity and trends. The logo should be timeless and not avant garde
    in any way.\r\n\r\nThe Lulu brand wants to take a part of the market by not beeing
    pink and girly but delivering serious fashion to desperate women with a big spending
    habit when it comes to fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-1_4054.png]"

    <em>especially</em> when it comes to their clothing!\r\n\r\nYou don't absolutely
    need to be \"frilly\", but this is really too frigid. It looks more like a clothing
    line for \"career women\". Or post-menopausal ones. With no kids.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-sans/med-bold/|John Sans]], which
    I throw out as an example of a font that is not too far off from what you have,
    but a little less rigid. I think this kind of R construction is closer to your
    brief than what you have."

    it needs to be jazzed up. I like the subtle roundness everything has and the 'R'
    and 'U' evoke images of pregnant women. Everything is much more balanced now than
    when you started the thread, however, the 'lulu' seems to be a bit tighter than
    your 'arver'.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to see the rest of the identity plans,
    if there are any yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\npenn"

    I think it makes to big of a statement though, even if it's not that far off.
    As I mentioned before I want the clothes and the photos to deliver most of the
    \"feel\" and the logo to be more subtle.\r\n\r\nPenn, I'm happy to hear that you
    believe in the design. I will post work on the logo and identity continuously.\r\n\r\n"

    hard to find serious fashion photography with pregnant models. \r\n\r\nTheese
    photos were all taken by Leibovitz and I think that her style suits the style
    of the clothes very well."
