  definitely condensed but I had no luck finding it in the FontBook. The uneven E
  and S gave me the thought that it's custom made. But certainly some Font created
  before 1953.\r\nAny Ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Lettering on gravestones was all done by hand in those days. In fact a few
    font designers learned their skill cutting letters in stone (Matthew Carter and
    Michael Harvey are two that I think have that background). The irregularities
    you noticed are for that reason. It was a very skilled craft.\r\n\r\nCan I ask
    why you want to find a similar font? Close will have to be good enough because
    I suspect many stonecutters evolved their own alphabets that were adapted from
    existing (or invented) typefaces to make them suitable for the medium they worked
    in.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "yes, those are letters out of metal with that emboss effect.\r\n\r\nI need
    to find a similar font, because my family needs to add another name to the gravestone.
    (don't know about other countries, but it's quite common to share a grave for
    a hole family in Germany)\r\nWhen my Grandfather passed away ten years ago, the
    stonemason didn't really match the fonts so my grandfathers name looks different
    to those to names. Now we need another name and we want to avoid another mismatch
    of fonts.\r\n\r\nI guess I have to talk to the stonemason, what he thinks about
    that. I really want to know, if those are letters forged by hand or if you can
    by this alphabet from a catalog.\r\n \r\nHere's the left side of the gravestone
    with the mismatching font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grabstein2_5495.jpg]"

    course, but I assumed that the process involved making casts of engraved letters
    (reversed). In the link Christopher has above, one of the replies is from a stonecutter
    from Wales who talks eloquently about what is required to make engraved lettering.
    I believed that making the originals for these cast letters would involve similar
    constraints and choices.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
