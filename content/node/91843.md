  body: "I notice that someone has taken the liberty of editing my header, changing
    \"Oriental\" to \"Asian.\" I'm sure this was well-intentioned (though heavy-handed),
    and I probably should have provided more context, but \"Asian\" here would be
    incorrect and anachronistic (political correctness notwithstanding). \r\n\r\nThis
    is for a poster on travel to the \"Orient\" in the 18th century. I wanted a font
    that would suggest or retain an aura, or even a hint, of this \"Orient\" that
    exercised such a strong hold on the public discourse and imagination of the period
    -- an \"Orient\" which, by the way, comprised the Middle East and the far reaches
    of Eastern Europe at least as much as Asia -- and which to be sure has since been
    exploded and delegitimized as a cultural referent. I was looking to evoke the
    more Middle Eastern \"Orient.\" \r\n\r\nHope this bit of historical context helps."

  body: Sorry, didn't meant to be spooky. Thought I was being sensitive. Your reasoning
    makes sense, though, and I've retitled the thread. Were my typeface suggestions
    helpful at all?
