  that requires the new Reading/Leeds logo however I can neither find nor work out
  what it is.\r\n\r\nMy guess is thats its a custom logo or possibly something cheap
  off Dafont by the style.\r\n\r\nCould someone help ID it please?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://rocktransmission.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/reading-leeds-2013.jpg"
