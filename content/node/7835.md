  body: Except for the last line, it looks a lot like 12 pt. Monaco &#40;bitmap version&#41;,

  body: In fact I&#39;ve heard that this typeface was specially made by the <a href="http://www.mmparis.com/">
    m/m</a> designers for the Palais de Tokyo. <BR>But it sure looks like a revamped
    Monaco. &#40;and I still prefer monaco, btw&#41;
