body: "I'm faced with the following fatal error message in FontLab:\r\n\r\n<code>
  Coverage offset overflow (0x10004) in single substitution </code>\r\n\r\nA google
  search hasn't revealed any particular information about what a 'coverage offset
  overflow' is, but I'm starting to suspect that it means the total size of my GSUB
  table has become too large.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression, however, that size
  limits pertained to individual lookups rather than to the entire font. However,
  I'm currently getting this when I add substitutions almost anywhere, even if they
  are clearly not in and of themselves large. For example, the font compiles fine
  as it is now, but when I add the following code to my 'salt' feature, I get the
  error indicated above:\r\n\r\n<code> lookup CurrencyAlt { </code>\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_<code>
  sub rupee by rupee.alt; </code>\r\n\r\n<code> } CurrencyAlt; </code>\r\n\r\nSince
  I'm placing this within its own lookup, this shouldn't be contributing to the size
  of any other lookup, and this is hardly a large substitutions.\r\n\r\nThe font in
  question does contain a very large amount of code involving substitutions which
  specify multiple contexts involving large classes (e.g. sub @X' @Y @Z by @W where
  the classes contain hundreds of glyphs), so it doesn't surprise me that I am starting
  to run into problems. The problem which I <em> am </em> having, though, is trying
  to track down exactly *which* portions of my code are at fault since the error itself
  starts cropping up when fairly trivial bits of code (such as the above) are added,
  and FontLabs error reporting isn't even indicating which <em> feature </em> is involved,
  let alone which lines of code are contributing to the problem.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  explain to me exactly what a 'coverage offset' is?\r\n\r\nWhich of the following
  is more likely to solve this sort of problem?\r\n\r\n\u2014 breaking larger lookups
  into smaller ones (even though the total number of substitutions remains the same)\r\n\r\n\u2014
  splitting classes into smaller ones (which would entail creating more substitution
  rules, but ones which deal with fewer glyphs).\r\n\r\nAny pointers would be appreciated,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n[n.b.
  I haven't even started kerning yet, so the GPOS table isn't involved -- I know overflow
  errors are quite common where the kern feature is involved]."

  body: "Nick, you can name lookups whatever you want. You refer back to these names
    when you put them into a feature lookup list.\r\n\r\n<quote><em>Can anyone explain
    to me exactly what a 'coverage offset' is?</em></quote>\r\n\r\nIt's a list of
    offsets from the start of any major OTF table that point to the actual data. Something
    like this (simplified ;-):\r\n\r\n<code>[GSUB] 'liga' pos_A 'ccmp' pos_B 'calt'
    POS_C ;\r\npos_A: 'f' pos_D ;\r\n             'T' pos_E ;\r\npos_D: 'i' -> f_i
    ;\r\n             'l' -> f_l ;\r\n</code>(etc.).\r\n\r\nThe default size for coverage
    tables is fixed to 16-bit values only, which means that the distance in bytes
    between the start of the table (pos_A) and the first definition (pos_D) may not
    be more than 64K. However, that's a meaningless number because you can't really
    influence that directly... [*]\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which of your options is best
    ... ADFKO, FontForge, and VOLT (but not FontLab!) allow <em>far</em> offsets,
    which can be greater than 16 bits (if I remember correctly, all the way up to
    32 bits, making multiple gigabyte lookup tables possible). I know, that doesn't
    help ...\r\n\r\n[*] Just noticed that number: 0x10004. It's a tad over 64K, so
    at least the error report is correct in that the offset is too big."

  body: "Thanks, Theunis\r\n\r\nSo basically, the 'in single substitution' part of
    the error isn't telling me that I should be looking for a single <code> sub </code>
    rule that's got too much stuff in it -- I need to address this with respect to
    the entire set of code to shrink down the table size (sort of what I thought,
    but FLab's error messages tend to be cryptic).\r\n\r\nPart of my 'to-do' list
    has been to clean up my code in general. Maybe now's a good time to start on that
    project with crossed fingers.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
