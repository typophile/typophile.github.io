body: "I wonder if we don\u2019t have Unicode-points for symbols, such as most frequently
  occuring PUBLIC ORIENTATION SIGNS. Last year I forwarded an initial proposal to
  get some 80 signs in the UCS, yet this takes ages to get along \u2013 to what end,
  nobody knows. (The proposal is downloadable at http://www.signographie.de/cms/standard.htm
  .) \u2013 \u2013 I think that public signage becomes a kind of \u201Cworld script\u201D
  steadily and therefore should be encoded. Both font producers and users alike would
  benefit from this. The usage of standard-based symbol fonts would be more stable,
  safer and faster. \u2013 \u2013 However, as long as the official encoding seems
  hardly to be achieved I should suggest a workaround: let\u2019s capture the PRIVAT
  USE AREA and collaborate towards an agreement upon which codepoint should host which
  sign. A kind of semi-standard might arise by this, if we than offer fonts on grounds
  of a synchronized encoding. \u2013 \u2013 Who is working on symbols/fonts and may
  be willing to contribute to an INITIATIVE to encode public orientation signs? \u2013
  \u2013 suggestions welcome, contributions most welcome!  A:S"

    Hudson etc.,) are going to come within ten miles of a PUA "land-grab" like this,
    especially considering the grief they''ve been given for their PUA actions in
    the past. I think efforts would be better directed to a universal symbol description
    language that might use glyph names or a new OpenType table to define the design
    of each symbol, then the actual symbols could live anywhere in the PUA.  '

  body: "I'm afraid Si's right about this one. \r\n\r\nI like the idea of an OT table
    to manage the design. This would allow each design to be composed of a single
    glyph, or multiple glyphs, and allow for re-use of componeents. That would allow
    fonts to be desinged for printing small, for printing large, for vinyl sign machines,
    etc, where the ideal solutions might vary."
