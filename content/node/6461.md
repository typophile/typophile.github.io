    <BR> <BR>Katherine, if you need the actual logo try this site, Tiffany has a couple
    of other sites. I doubt this is a typeface

  body: Thanks, I actually got this logo from a similar website. <BR> <BR>What I want
    to do is to create a parody of the logo with my friend&#39;s name &#40;a big Ikea
    fan&#41; instead of &#34;IKEA.&#34; I guess I will just have to fake it myself.  <BR>
    <BR>Good news is that the name&#39;s Qarin, so I already have two letters. ;&#41;

  body: No, no, no... It&#39;ll do for my friend &#40;got it done today in a print
    shop, looks mighty fine&#41;, but this is such a rush job and I have no &#34;active&#34;
    experience in typography anyway. <BR> <BR>But one day I&#39;ll be back with a
    font I&#39;m gonna design from scratch myself. It might take me years, but I will
    do it. Promise.
