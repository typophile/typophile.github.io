  body: The windmill mark is nice, but overall the composition feels crowded and unbalanced.

  body: "I think the word 'GRUPA' might get lost if you use the whole logo at a small
    size. \r\n\r\nAlso I'm having a slight problem reading the logo. It might be because
    it's in a foreign language, but I wonder if the problem isn't helped by the use
    of all caps. Maybe try it without the use of caps, or perhaps space out 'INTERAKTYWNI'
    a little.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

  body: Yes, you have the problem with reading because it is a polish language. I
    don't think there is a problem for Poles. But thanks.

  body: "Does anyone else find it odd that he is making a logo for a company that
    makes logos? \r\n\r\nAnyways...\r\nI still think it could use some more spacing
    adjustments in INTERAKTYWNI. Not a fan of the colors but it could just be a cultural
    thing."

  body: "I'm not sure why, but it looks a bit like a logo for a new bank trying to
    look very serious. :-\\\r\n\r\nColors: I think their difference in darkness/saturation
    can work for the mark, but not so well in the type \u2013 GRUPA seems too active/strong
    compared to INTERAKTYWNI.\r\n\r\nSpacing: Can anything be done about the holes
    in there (look at \"KTY\"!)? You should at least *try* loosening the rest of the
    spacing to get it more-or-less even. But maybe it's too loose then. I guess a
    higher-class thing to attempt would be a T_Y ligature.\r\n\r\nGlyphs: Some seem
    too dark. The \"W\" needs help, and the \"K\". But that sort of stuff is hard
    to tell at this size. What font is that anyway?"
