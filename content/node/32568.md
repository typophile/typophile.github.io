  the right place...\r\n\r\nI was wondering if any of you knew what the typeface was
  that is used in the logo of \"Design Of The Time\"?\r\n\r\nHere is the website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dott07.com/\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\n\r\nNat"

    your responses!\r\n\r\nI think I will be going with Avant Garde, though the others
    were pretty similar.\r\n\r\nAny ideas about the different sized \"0\" for the
    \"07\" is there a special way you can do this or is it part of the typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

      by Frutiger had the \"drop numbers\" if there is such a term!\r\n\r\nCheck out:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/13463/apolloromansc-font.html\r\n\r\nIf
      you go in and create your own sample and type in 07 you will see the seven has
      a descender!\r\n\r\nThanks all the same, as I will be using the \"special way\"
      you suggested!\r\n\r\nNat\r\n"
