  a numeral?\r\nI'm not sure if I've seen it in print or wether I've just ignored
  it but it looks pretty awkward on screen here.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the document to change all the other 2010s, reflow hell.

  body: Except that AD with the A as a drop is almost as bad as just the number. (This
    doesn't apply to a year, I think, but most style books say that if a number starts
    a sentence, it should be spelled out, as fFntgrube suggested.)

  body: "What if a chapter starts with a long poem, and rewrite is not an option?\r\nShold
    one:\r\nA. Drop cap the first instance of prose text. (might fall on the next
    page, or even further down the queue)\r\nB. Abandon drop caps in that chapter.\r\nC.
    Attempt to drop cap the first line of the poem (might look mighty weird.)\r\n\r\nSo
    far, I am leaning towards B\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "This is more of a raised cap\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P1130804_5547.JPG]\r\nIt's
    interesting how the whole number \"18\" is raised. In the case of 2010 which is
    longer it might be more problematic to drop the whole thing. But it's very eye
    catching editorially: it's obviously a year and it makes people want to know what
    happened in 2010 but I think aesthetically it depends on how condensed the drop
    cap face is and how wide the column of text is."

  body: "It could be \"27\" dropped or raised followed by \"thousand and 546 customers...\"
    or even \"27,\" followed by \"546 customers...\"\r\nThe main reason for drop caps
    in commercial and editorial applications is to grab attention. It is even more
    attention grabbing when there are numbers involved so I don't see why they should
    be treated as an exception.\r\nAnother great one would be a drop cap question
    mark in Spanish or a drop cap # in a text dealing with html or coding."
