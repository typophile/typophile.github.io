  body: I recall the design (when the orignal album came out) and I've seen the face
    before as well, but I'm not near my old pre-digital type books at the moment.

  body: Yep, it's not hand-drawn. It also appears on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JethroTull-albums-heavyhorses.jpg">this
    album cover</a>, but I'll have to go through a couple of old books to see if I
    can spot it -- I just can't recall the name of the typeface.

  body: Abbey Road is the first album I remember listening to as a kid. I still have
    my parents old scratched LP. Can't bear to part with it.
