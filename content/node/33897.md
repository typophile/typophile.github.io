  don't have much to go on other than a friend's suggestion of a font called \"Fortuna
  Dot\" that I've had no luck in finding.\r\nAny help's appreciated."

    separate the dots from the background in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/budmo/\">Budmo</a>,
    by Ray Larabie. It might be as simple as nulling part of the letter in your graphics
    application.\r\n\r\nI am guessing that the letters might have been from a film
    type (photolettering), that has not been digitized.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    suspected.
