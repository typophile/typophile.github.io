  I received a photo of the Egenolff-Berner specimen of 1592. I could observe that
  there are different sizes of garamond types. There is \"Petit Canon\", \"Romain
  Parangon\", \"Romain Gros Text\", \"Romain S. Augustin\", \"Romain Cicero\" and
  \"Romain Garamond\". There are alos two romans and a few italics by Granjon. \r\n\r\nMy
  intention was to compare Stempel Garamond\u2014the original design of 1924 and not
  the digital version\u2014\_with the Egenholff-Berner specimen. My problem now is
  that I don't know which size was used for the adaptation of the Stempel Garamond.
  Can you suggest a strategy to help me identify it or at least to get an idea of
  the kind of decisions the technicians at Stempel took for the adaptation of the
  Stempel Garamond?\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "Yeah, after I wrote that I suspected it might be too\r\nlabyrinthine... but
    then I got lazy and left it as is.  :-)\r\n\r\nI meant that Stempel Garamond might
    not be a \"literal\" recreation of a given size of the original (I mean even if
    they ironed out -presumed- printing artefacts, which historically almost nobody
    has ever left in, for any revival effort). It could be (and probably is) that
    to some extent, but quite possibly not enough for you to be looking too closely
    at a single size of the original. Note here that you can't ever fully trust the
    pedigree that might have officially been claimed at the time of its release -
    like how even to this day some Jannon revivals still try to allude to being a
    Garamond, all these decades after Warde's article. My all-time favorite is this
    classic bit of Copperfield-grade obfuscation:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/simoncini-garamond/\r\n\r\nSomebody
    around here should know about the Stempel for sure.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Based primarily on the counter of the 'a' and 'e', I'm going to say that
    the best match is the \"Romain Cicero\", which according to the Fournier Manuel
    Typographique is approximately 12pt. The next size up, the St. Augustin, has distinctly
    smaller counters as appropriate for display.\r\n\r\nThe Linotype material I have
    boasts of Stempel's possession of an original copy of the Berner sheet, and to
    my eyes, it's a fairly literal revival. Since I'm looking at the Linotype version,
    some of the differences (short descenders, fairly wide 'm') may be due to that
    adaptation rather than what Stempel did.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the Stempel version
    does honestly seem to be based on the Garamond model, rather than Jannon or Aldus
    or anyone else. Also, looking at (my reproduction of) the Berner sheet, I'm struck
    by how beautifully the optical scaling has been done.\r\n\r\nOf course, now that
    Garamond Premier Pro is out, pretty much all the fun has been taken out of Garamond
    revivals. I was just looking at my Le Be from a few years back, and am not sure
    I'm ever going to finish it."

  body: "I read over the previous thread, and can highly recommend the \"Type Specimen
    Facsimiles\" edition. The reproduction there, while not perfect, is vastly better
    than the GIF attached to your thread. I also have high-res scans of that facsimile,
    with 200 dpi versions <a href=\"http://www.levien.com/type/berner/\">here</a>
    and the 2400 dpi original scans at the <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/levienfonts/berner/\">TeX
    archive</a>.\r\n\r\nThe best Stempel Garamond source I've found so far in my library
    is Hermann Zapf's Manuale Typographicum. According to the book, \"HZ and his design
    philosophy,\" \"the type specimen of Konrad Berner of 1592 was the source for
    the redesign of the Stempel Garamond.\" Examining it more closely, I see that
    Stempel was in fact responsible for the shortening of the descenders (they were
    German, after all). They did a creditable job, but something has definitely been
    lost in the elegance of the 'g'.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure now that they didn't just
    trace over a particular size, because I see elements from different sizes mixed.
    Overall, the Garamond is remarkably consistent across the size range, but there
    are some systematic differences such as 'a' and 'e' counter size, as well as quirks
    such as the height of the upper left serif in the 'p'. In the Cicero and Galliard,
    it's just a touch high (a tendency which is greatly exaggerated in the Jannon
    branch of Garamond-named fonts), but in the Petit Canon it looks just in line.
    The Stempel follows the large sizes here. (Incidentally, the Stempel 'p' is also
    considerably wider than the Berner sheet. I think it was traditional for the bowl
    of the 'p' to be a wee bit smaller than the 'o' norm, something that gave me an
    inordinate amount of trouble when digitizing the Le Be Book. This quirk is completely
    normalized out of the Stempel. The Stempel has a more pronounced pen angle, as
    well, suggesting that this letter was redrawn from scratch).\r\n\r\nThe 'a' tells
    a different story. There's no way the Stempel could have been drawn from the large
    sizes, which show a very smooth and refined bowl, and a very light touch on the
    terminal. Stempel is characteristically quirky in both regards, and also has a
    general lean to the left (a wide top) completely absent in the Canons. The heavier
    terminal weight and top width vary unsystematically across the size range, but
    the Cicero is certainly not far off.\r\n\r\nIn other tiny details, Stempel doesn't
    follow the Garamond closely at all. For example, in most sizes the top right serif
    of the 'u' is much heavier than the top left, but in Stempel they're only subtly
    different. Also, the Stempel 'i' dot is big and bold, much more subtle in the
    Garamonds. The Stempel 'M' is much more symmetrical left-right; Garamond in all
    sizes has noticeably more white under the right side of the vee than the left.
    A lot of these changes count, I think, as regularizing the alphabet to match twentieth-century
    expectations.\r\n\r\nHope you find this useful. It was a pleasure to go back to
    the Berner sheet and study it closely again. Garamond does indeed deserve much
    of his fame."

    we split up the font design work between us? You do the inelegant text fonts,
    I'll confine myself to elegant ones.\r\n\r\nIncunabular romans generally have
    very long descenders (small x-heights) by today's standards, but I have found
    a couple of very old examples that could almost pass for '70s ITC designs. One
    is the 1689 <em>Plininae exercitationes</em> by J. Vande Water, Utrecht (reproduced
    as plate 184 in Day and Morison's <em>Typographic Book</em>), and another is the
    Groote Garmont Romeyn in the specimen sheet of Jan Roman, Amsterdam, c. 1762 (reproduced
    in the Type Specimen Facsimiles edition, p. 13). A couple of things to look at
    next time you head for the library.\r\n"
