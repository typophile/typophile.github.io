  into a usable font. I would suggest something along the lines of FontLab (which
  I think is what we used in school) but I'd like to give her something a little more
  simple -- hopefully so she won't have to mess with illustrator etc. \r\n\r\nJust
  from googling I've seen a couple services dedicated to this, but I'm wondering if
  any of you have tried something like this and/or would recommend one over the other.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n
  \r\n\r\nHelen"
