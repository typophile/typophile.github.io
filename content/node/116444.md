  body: "Can't identify it and really doubt it could be something else than a heavy
    (and amateurish) customization, or even a mash-up. Many details look weird: /R
    top left corner (serif removed?), /R leg (which looks to have been added to a
    a /P actually), weird /s and /r among the orthers...\r\nSome alternatives but
    far from being even loosely similar: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/terital-united|Terital

  body: "Thanks Ryuk! \r\n\r\nI thought it might have been a mash-up as you say because
    the /s/ looks out of place and the /R looks really awkward."
