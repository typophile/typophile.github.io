  body: 'I&#39;m almost sorry  you picked my site to help with that, because I have
    very little ID material on serif fonts &#40;yet&#41;. I looked through &#34;Modern
    Encyclopedia of Typefaces&#34; &#40;Wallis&#41; looking for slab or near slab
    faces with an E with almost equal arms. I spent some time looking at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/demos/medium/testdrive.html?s=KRISTALL-APOTHEKE&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Demos</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/swift/ef-regular/testdrive.html?s=KRISTALL-APOTHEKE&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Swift</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-weidemann/medium/testdrive.html?s=KRISTALL-APOTHEKE&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">ITC Weidemann</a>. I can see real mismatches with the last two
    now, but Demos is possibly a fair substitute.  <BR> <BR>You didn&#39;t say what
    the age or source of the sample was, and if it&#39;s from an old piece of printed
    media, that would possibly rule out many fonts we would look at. It could even
    be a typeface that hasn&#39;t been digitized. If it is a font, there is always
    the potential for Tiffany&#39;s &#39;squooshing&#39; to have been used. <BR> <BR>General
    plea for ID requesters: Please tell us something about the source of the sample,
    so we can have as much helpful information as possible.'

    But Yves, if it was stroked that wouldn&#39;t make the serif shape change would
    it? I would have thought the stroke only would make the type look bolder. &#40;That&#39;s
    what I sometimes use the stroke for -- when there is no bolder weight.&#41;

    last thing I would have ever looked at!  Grrr! I hate when they do that. Usually
    they use standard MS fonts, and I&#39;ve learned to spot those, but the ancient
    Mac fonts are almost never used. Is somebody going to send us a sample of Geneva
    next? I&#39;ll be ready for &#39;em.

    But Yves, if it was stroked that wouldn&#39;t make the  <BR>serif shape change
    would it? I would have thought the  <BR>stroke only would make the type look bolder.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Actually, that&#39;s the funny thing when stroking characters:  <BR>it
    changes the properties of a typeface and makes it  <BR>shift from one category
    to another. I once sat in on  <BR>a type design basic course at a Monotype Conference  <BR>ten
    years ago, and one of the exercises was to add an  <BR>equal amount of weight
    to a character. What happened  <BR>was that for example a modern face became an
    aldine,  <BR>an aldine became a slab serif etc. Very interesting  <BR>stuff. I
    can&#39;t fill you in on the finer details as I&#39;m no type  <BR>designer and
    it&#39;s a decade ago, but maybe one of our  <BR>esteemed colleagues can provide
    more details.'
