  Mrs. Eves headers. The headers will be all caps, lightly tracked. I have many elements
  (sidebars, etc.) that are to be set in Meta (so there's my sans), but wanted something
  a bit different instead of setting the whole thing in Mrs. Eves.\r\n\r\nAnother
  display font I'm using is http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/always/\r\n\r\nThank
  you for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nJanet"

  body: You're going about this the wrong way. Pick your body face first so that you're
    using something suited to the text instead of picking a display face and then
    picking a text face to go with it.

  body: "You are going to need an as-neutral-as-possible serif to hide beneath both
    Mrs. Eaves, which has a lot of personality, and Meta which also has a lot of personality.
    Or you need a serif with personality that doesn't detract too much from the those
    first two. I say \"too much\" because you are going to have some kind of tension
    that doesn't work in your favor with 3 typefaces that are all so distinct.\r\n\r\nI
    played around with Mrs. Eaves and Meta on a page, and without spending more than
    a few minutes, found that New Baskerville and New Century Schoolbook create a
    third leg to create a sufficiently balanced, albeit awkward, three-legged stool.\r\n\r\nI
    had all four of those typefaces set as samples for a recipe book on font combinations
    I'm working on, so it was easy to try them out in a broader context.\r\n\r\nI
    like the New Century Schoolbook combination best as it has a sufficiently dark
    enough color with neutral tracking to hold it's own against both other faces which
    are heavy.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of all three at work on one page:\r\n\r\nhttp://bonfx.com/combine-mrs-eaves-meta-and-new-century-schoolbook/\r\n\r\nAgain,
    this only took me a few minutes because, for the book I'm working on, I had the
    font templates already made. It was drag and drop and then a screenshot.\r\n\r\nBe
    sure to click to enlarge."
