  font. I'm sure it's not Trade Gothic, League Gothic, Bebas or Bebas Neue. I had
  a distant recollection of a font like this with 'Bureau' in the name, but have searched
  and can't find it. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/00-make-great-first-impression_5430.jpg]"
