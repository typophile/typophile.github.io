  OT fonts. At least this is what is recommended in 'Learn FL fast'.\r\n\r\nMy question
  is: is it really necessary? What happen if the OT font is generated while in 'Name
  mode'?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro."

    is, what's so difficult about clicking the Codepages button? Isn't \"better safe
    than sorry,\" regardless of the reason, worth the minute effort?"

  body: 'It is a pain to click the button for a 16 fonts family. And when you have
    so many fonts open, the windows are small and the button not visible, so you must
    resize the window and then to click the button, and then to resize the window
    again. I do not like it. '

  body: If you keep Names mode active and don't get the warning dialog seen on p86
    of LFF, you're probably OK. Judging from the Preferences in FL5, codepages are
    automatically exported with OpenType fonts unless "Ignore Unicode indexes" is
    checked. It's only Type 1 fonts that require Codepages mode to be active when
    generating (assuming that's the option selected in the "Generating Type 1" preferences).

  body: If you begrudge Octomom's prolificacy and wish to spawn an entire family (or
    just a bunch of bastards) all in one go-- open Fontlab's Action Set tool, keep
    the set empty (or add desired "genetic enhancements"), apply to "Fonts in the
    Fonts list", add your baby batter (ahem, source files), set the format, and let
    em drop. Should take considerably less than nine months, unless the the stork
    gets distracted by a spinning beachball, in which case you'll need to kill the
    stork and start over.

  body: All I know is that using WordPad, I occasionally find that some fonts don't
    work properly because it refuses to allow me to change text from one font to another
    if they don't share a common codepage that includes the selected characters. So
    if a font has the wrong codepage data, or codepage data that is too limited, with
    it, some applications won't be able to use it.
