body: "I'm wondering whether and in which extent it is possible to make Roman figures
  an applicable opentype feature (Stylistic Set).\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n<ul><li>converting
  \"1234\" to \"MCCXXXIV\" (there are javascripts who can do that, but they are rather
  complex compared to the possibilities of opentype) \r\n<li>kind of a ligature-feature,
  converting MCCXXXIV to \"MCCX_X_XI_V\" in an \"intelligent\" way  (not creating
  groups like \"MCCX_XX_IV\" instead).\r\n<li>any other ideas?</ul>\r\n\r\nHas anybody
  thought about this already? Or is it just impossible?\r\n\r\nSebastian"

    think it is impossible. Maybe it will be possible  when multiple substitution(http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.b)
    would be implemented."
