  body: Hi..this font is based on the typeface used on French number plates. It was
    designed/modifed by Pierre Bernard, the guy who runs the studio. It was used for
    signage when the Georges Pompidou Centre underwent renovation. The typeface, and
    the process was feature in the Eye 32 (Summer 99) but unfortunately the online
    [[http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=19&fid=94|article]] is very sparse
    and no pictures.
