body: "Hi, I read a lot of reviews about font management programs and decided to try
  Suitcase on my PC. While reviews say it is intuitive and easy to use, I find its
  interface very poor. It is pain to navigate, choose, activate, and organize fonts.
  The interface is awkward, and even lacks basic functionality. \r\n\r\nFor example
  if I don't view fonts listed by family and select the font on the font list pane,
  the Preview pane doesn't have a scroll bar when the font doesn't fit in it, so in
  order to see all letters, I have to change its preview size and can't see it at
  the desired size.\r\n\r\nThe font list pane is the most awkwardly designed list
  view. Clicking on names of columns to sort also moves the scroll bar so if I'm at
  the letter A on the top I still stay at the letter A but at the bottom which defeats
  the whole point of sorting and the worst of this is if I sort the fonts by Activated,
  when I'm not on top or bottom of the list, the activated fonts do not appear in
  view until I scroll the pane bar. \r\n\r\nIf I want to view all letters of all fonts
  in a set by scrolling with the page keys on my keyboard I have to make sure I never
  click in the font list pane and if I have, then in order to be able to page in the
  Preview pane again, I have to go to the Library pane, select another Library and
  then select back the desired Library.\r\n\r\nThe worst of all is, if I view fonts
  grouped by families and activate a font in the Preview pane, Suitcase will automatically
  scroll the Preview pane to the top of the list. For example let's say I want to
  scroll with the page key in the Preview pane to find fonts by their look and activate
  them. Upon activation of a font, Suitcase will scroll aromatically back to the top
  of the list loosing the place in the list which is very frustrating. When I like
  a font I would like to activate the whole family but this is possible only in the
  font list pane and if I go there and select a font family, I loose the scrolling
  through all fonts of the set in the Preview pane because choosing an item in the
  font list pane shows only that in the Preview pane.\r\n\r\nScrolling the font list
  pane with the arrow keys on the keyboard is a pain too. Down arrow selects the next
  font family down the list. The right arrow expands the font family folder with all
  fonts in it selected, so pressing the down arrow again doesn't select the first
  font in the family as expected but the next font family which makes no sense. \r\n\r\nAdding
  fonts in different libraries or sets is big pain too because it is not possible
  to have expanded views of all libraries at the same time which causes excessive
  dragging. First drag to the library, wait to expand, then drag down the list of
  sets, find the set and finally drop. Why not leave the desired libraries expanded
  all the time so the user can see where the set is and drag directly to it.\r\n\r\nThese
  are just a few of my annoying and frustrating experiences with Suitcase. I'm describing
  my experience in the hopes that other users can understand what would be a good
  font manager for me and give some suggestions. Trying each font manager takes considerable
  time to evaluate it properly and I'm hoping those of you who have experiences with
  other font managers can share it.\r\n\r\nI will greatly appreciate your input."

    be a little more flexible in order to be satisfied with any of them, but maybe
    try NexusFont? It\u2019s pretty new and it\u2019s free."

  body: No, I haven't tried any other font managers. If you guys have used a font
    manager that lets you quickly organize, find, choose font, and is pleasure to
    use, please let me know.
