  grab? somewhat similar to screen grab but for recording over time to make moving
  image. basically a movie of the screen content. \r\n\r\nIf anybody is using is etc
  etc let me know!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n(If you feel this would be better
  suited to 3d/experiemental etc feel free to move it, I just felt it would reach
  a wider audience in the general forum)\r\n\r\n"
