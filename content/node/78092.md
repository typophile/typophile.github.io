  my brochure with the following requirements : \r\n\r\n- color printing\r\n- on glossy
  white plastic sheets, A4 size, rounded corners (radius:50) \r\n- untearable, unfoldable
  but bendable (400 gr.)\r\n- 100 pages\r\n\r\nDo you know someone who could do that?\r\nSince
  I'm located in France, an online print shop would be the best for me.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot in advance :)"

  body: The limited quantity would make the cost of traditional printing prohibitive
    because of set-up charges. Any competent sign shop could probably print your items
    on a large-format inkjet printer, and could probably handle the finishing as well.

  body: "You may find a sign shop that would inkjet print your design on adhesive
    vinyl and apply it to foamed PVC board (brand names such as Komatex, Sintra, etc.
    Other brands may be available in Europe) which can be obtained in thicknesses
    from 1mm to 25mm. A few shops may be able to print directly on the board, but
    rigid substrate printers consume a great deal of space and many smaller shops
    do not wish to sacrifice their working area to such monsters.\r\n\r\nA silkscreen
    printer (usually primarily a T-shirt printer, but most will accept other work)
    might be better able to handle your small quantity request, but might not have
    the corner rounding tool a sign shop has. Full-color can be done with silkscreen,
    but like anything that multiplies the set-up expense.\r\n\r\nThere should be several
    sign shops and silkscreen printers in any area with a commercial base, even in
    France. With your very specific needs, it is better to be able to see the work
    done locally than to ship it off to some faraway land in mere hopes of getting
    a better price.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.yupo.com/|Yupo]] is a synthetic paper that
    may be more suited to your specifications than foamed PVC, and certain weights
    can be run through an ordinary offset press. It may not be economical for your
    small quantity, but there it is as another option to consider."

  body: "As others mentioned you might want to check with local sign shops. And I
    wonder if printers that prepare credit cards would be worth looking into, since
    they do high-quality printing on plastic with radius corners. The size and thickness
    would be different in your case, but they might be able to handle it or refer
    you to someone who could.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you call it a \"brochure\" but that
    term (at least in the U.S.) usually refers to a folded piece. A piece that's a
    single unfolded sheet is usually called a flyer. "

    FLYERS (wink) in Paris ASAP and let you know how it goes. I hope it won't be too
    expensive :(\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n"

    on anything in high quality, and ask for polyester sheets

  body: "I work at a printer USA and we have a HP Indigo 7000 digital printing press.
    It will print on different plastics, 12inx18in (304cm x 459cm). I'm betting there
    would be in printer in France that has one or it's competitor. We do it all the
    time on plastics. Some plastics need a treatment done to get the ink to stick
    though. For your finished size, it would probably print 2 on a sheet then round
    cornered via die, grinder or digital cutting table.\r\n\r\nMore info Here: [[http://h10088.www1.hp.com/cda/gap/display/main/index.jsp?zn=gap&cp=20000-13698-14391-14404^198593_4041_100__|HP
