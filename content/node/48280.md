  gardener. I''ve never worked on a project of this kind and am struggling to find
  a suitable typographic approach whilst retaining a contemporary aesthetic . Just
  wondering if anyone has any reference material to direct me too or suitable typefaces?
  i know this is a bit vague but any help would be appreciated. thanks   '

    It would be easier to find a suitable type face if we know what direction you
    want to head in first. Sketch up a few ideas (if you haven't already) and post
    them here. \r\n\r\nThere aren't a set of fonts that are \"suited\" for landscaping
    identities :)\r\n\r\npenn"
