  body: "The A foot serif seems to be the most distinctive thing about these samples.
    These are the only letters you have ever seen?\r\n\r\nNot one of those letters
    is included in the 12 key letters for my <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a>, but if you have other letters, you can use that to see if it
    matches any existing fonts.\r\n\r\nWithout more samples, that's the best I can
    suggest.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
