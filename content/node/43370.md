  body: The rest of it also looks like (poorly) altered Rockwell. They cut up some
    of the serifs and extended some of the strokes. It looks terrible.

  body: "thanks for your answers. Now, do you think it can be a freeware font from
    a free-download-fonts-site such as dafont.com? or its a customized work for this
    client?\r\n\r\nJust like you I also think it\xB4s a terrible outcome if they tried
    to make a new original font for this work.\r\nThey have applied (sorry for my
    English) in all the Province of C\xF3rdoba\xB4s official agencies\xB4s logotypes
    and they look terrible.\r\nProvince of C\xF3rdoba, Argentina"
