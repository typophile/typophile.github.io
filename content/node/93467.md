body: "Hi. I'm looking for helpful feedback about my direction, both in choosing and
  adapting Freehand521 for a start-up clothing company.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm driving
  towards a clever, whimsical, slightly nostalgic feel (think letterman jackets, patches,
  or baseball uniforms \u2013\_but with a hip, perhaps sexy, modern twist) \u2013
  particularly agreeable to women primarily both for themselves and their children
  (infants to kids), very appealing to teen girls and slumber parties and their boyfriends
  (the dynamic that draws boys into cute and fun interactions with their first high-school
  and college crushes)...but ultimately a sexy \"cute\" for couples who define themselves
  young at heart...and not entirely beyond the reach of an adult man who too might
  have a playful demeanor or a father to daughters or neices.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Zip**\"
  (I'M REQUESTING NOT TO BE TYPED HERE, SO HIDDEN FROM SEARCH ENGINES) cannot be altered
  and has a lot of meaning, based on the design of the garments (which employ a new
  zipper technology).\r\n\r\nThe capital \"Z\" of the font was not a clearly, legible
  design so I worked out one that didn't curl but was more instantly recognizable.
  I also added a little wispy curl to the lower-case \"z\".  \"Zip\" I wanted together,
  and \"zi\" separate but together, the latter to be added to product names (think
  Citi of Citibank, Citigroup, etc.).\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense.  I'm just curious
  if other professionals agree this hits the marks I've described, or have suggestions
  to confirm a better font selection or adaptation.\r\n\r\nCheers, in advance. \r\n\r\nPS:
  Color and pattern treatments available upon request, along with product naming conventions
  I've explored\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zip**LogoBW_6546.png]"

  body: "I think the triple stroke plus shadow is just a bit over the top. Take away
    those enhancements and make the raw lettering sing. In particular, the p tail
    crossing the z creates a big awkward dark spot, and the flow between some of the
    pairs feels irregular.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Luma.  Yes, the \"p\" tail going through the small \"z\" has been
    tricky. Here's the work already done to-date.\r\n\r\nI should clarify. The artwork
    first posted is an applicae patch, which is a usage requirement. However, the
    \"options\" I'm posting are the actual logo. As you can see, it's a bit more sleek
    and has greater white-space throughout. \r\n\r\nBut back to the p-z relationship.
    I'm not sure which, if any, solve the situation better. Am I at \"good enough\"
    stage?\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zip**Options_4404.png]"

  body: "What do you think now. \r\n1. Smoother transitions (less forced, I'm hoping)\r\n2.
    Reducing dark \"hole\" or \"spot\" by 40% (a total rework of that area)\r\n\u2013
    as such, it carries essentially the same area/energy as the \"p's\" twist.\r\n\r\nBetter?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zip**pt_rework_5461.png]"
