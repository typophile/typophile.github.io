  and geometry?  It seems like this could be an interesting blend between the ultimate
  classic text face and a more 'contemporary' style.\r\n\r\nHere's a couple of quick
  drawings I made of what said typeface might look like.  Note the classical Garamond
  'a' (based loosely on Stempel Garamond) and subtly bracketed slabs in an Egyptienne
  style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cairo_5757.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hangar_5478.png]\r\n\r\nHas
  something like this ever been done before?  Is it too incongruous?  And ultimately,
  is it worth pursuing?  \r\n\r\n"

    by Christian Schwartz and Erik Spiekermann for Deutsche Bahn AG, approaches this
    basic concept; however, it is based on a Jannon-derived Garamond, not a true Garamond.\r\n\r\nI
    once started sketching out a light, contemporary slab based also somewhat on an
    ATF Garamond skeleton (not unlike the sort of relationship between Nick Shinn\u2019s
    Bodoni Egyptian and his Bodoni models). But I didn\u2019t take it very far and
    it\u2019s been sitting idle for several years."

    it's proprietary I believe, and as you said it's not exactly what I'm thinking
    about creating.  \r\n\r\nDo you have any of your sketches of those concepts?  Could
    be really interesting to look at."

    looking at it again, now I realize why I probably dropped it. It was looking coincidentally
    way too much like Sumner Stone\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/silicalightspeci.html\">Silica</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Couperin-peek110327_4272.png]"
