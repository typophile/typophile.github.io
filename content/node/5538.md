  body: I need to scan in the card for you all to see. It is very close to Goudy Handtooled,
    not too much bolder. I&#39;ll probably just use that, but thanks all for you help.
    It is for a custom shop with an average logo. You could see the potential, cool
    mega-phat tire, but then they used goudy!! not quite as cool looking a logo as
    West Coast Customs. <BR> <BR>BJ ... you are right about that, if I needed something
    bolder. I&#39;m sooooooooo lazy.
