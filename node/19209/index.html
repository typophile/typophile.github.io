<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Since Adobe needs 2 years where everybody else only needed one year to convert their apps to Universal I'm wondering how many of you are waiting that long and how many are ditching Adobe.
For my 2¢ I'm less and less dependent on Adobe with each job. So it's rather unlikely that I'll hold my breath. How about you?
can someone turn this into a poll somehow? I don't see that option here.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm happy to wait. Besides at the moment there are no intel powermacs and its not like we are going to use imacs or powerbooks in a production environment.</div>

Gardener, taxi driver, rocket scientist? Does this say more about your ability to hold down a job than it does about Adobe?

<div class=commentbody>I'm with Aether. I'm more likely to wait with my trusty G4 than to switch to something other than Adobe's offerings. I'm the kind of guy that actually tries out apps like Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus, FontForge, etc. so I know where there at. I applaud their work, but to simply say they lack feature parity with Adobe products would be an understatement.
Adobe knows their business, and aquiring Macromedia was probably one of the smartest things they could have done. They bought out their closest competition.
Frank are you one of those people that does all their typsetting in TeX?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The TeX, publisher and Mellel comments cracked me up :)
I'm actually on again with the Quark beta for typesetting parts as they didn't sleep-in. For Photoshop I'm using Cinepaint since some months now as Photshop's wimpy 16-Bit support doesn't quite cut it with real color correction, especially when you need to do the work on 32-Bit float images or higher, like bringing down HDRI files.
I basically only use photoshop to add type to the final images, or to do title plates to integrate with Cinepaint or Final Cut.
I tried Inkscape and quickly got bored. Xara seems to have topped Illustrator a while ago, but spending a day installing it? naah!
@ Miguel: I got in late with X on production machines since virtually nothing was there, but with the Intel machines I only have very few apps that I need that aren't ported yet. I'm actually looking forward to be running my X11 apps in virtualization mode.
So until Xara has something installable out I'll stick with Illustrator. Photoshop might be still around for backwards compatibility with my archives. Pages is becoming more powerful with each update, I'm doing all of my letters and invoices with it now. Might be a real layout app soon.
Also I'm wondering if Adobe has a huge interest in Mac native versions anymore since virtualization and bootcamp. They were having a hard time with OS-X right from the start so that'll be interesting to watch.
Production machines, Aether? Did you actually work on a new iMac yet? I was very surprised how well it handles HD content, didn't try film res yet on one of those.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well lucky for me i'm running a PC XP desktop environment side by side with OSX Intel CoreDuo Powerbook, so its the best of both worlds. The only drawback here is software licencing.
The Mac is still fresh, so i havent had a lot of time to test it through Rosetta. From all reports its sluggish at best, but so long as its not the primary environment, then i cant imagine major dramas.
Still fairly fresh to the industry, applications like Quark are something i've never had to meddle with. Snicker if you will at my naiveity, but i cant imagine ever needing anything beyond the CS suite for print/web design. They really have got all bases covered, and integration is getting better and better.

<div class=commentbody>Let's see - am I going to ditch my Dual Gig G4 with a 72 gig 15,000RPM SCSI scratch disk, 3 internal drives, and 2 gigs of RAM to buy an Imac or a Powerbook with an Intel chip and then stop using Adobe products because they are holding to their typical 18-24 month development cycle?
I'll really have to think about that…

<div class=commentbody>I'd be less concerned for when Adobe provides Universal apps than when Apple no longer supports Power PC apps. Universal is going to make your design better? I don't have a problem with electronic "progress" but I also like my money spent to get it's full usage.

<div class=commentbody>This is "hammer" syndrome stuff—give a kid a hammer there will suddenly be nails all over the house just begging to be banged back into the floor boards.
Remember that every machine and application that you buy is already obsolete because the successor is under development. To date no software development schedule has ever led to having any of my jobs cancelled or delayed. So I just don't worry about what's coming when. It is not the platform or application that determines the result. It is the interface of task and user. One just does the job with what one has. When the tool is no longer capable of the task, then I look for new stuff. Oh yes, I also make it a principle to never buy a new car.</div>
