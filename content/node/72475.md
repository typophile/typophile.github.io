    PDF. Maybe I'll print it myself?"

    such a huge demand!

  body: "I tried to buy the mag, got sidetracked by PayPal (they wanted me to update
    my account and change my password and other sh*t), which of course took a while
    and did not route me back to the purchasing process, which meant that I had to
    start again, which was a mayor bummer because the magazine was (now) sold out.\r\n\r\nIn
    the spur of my anger I composed a cynical email to send to Elliot, but could not
    send it because the smtp-server on my connection in Paris did not work. \r\n\r\nWhich
    concludes my not too happy experience, haha!"
