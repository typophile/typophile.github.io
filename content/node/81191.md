  body: There are probably a lot of type with this kind of /t. Anyway, if you want
    to reproduce this /t, you first need to work the type as vector and mix the bottom
    part of a mirrored /j and the top of a /t...

  body: My apologies... I've just come to realize that I had overlooked your title.
    Thought I'd found a match... Sorry for that. And yes, definitely Brighton (as
    it is written in the title...) with a tweaked /t made from a /j and a /t.
