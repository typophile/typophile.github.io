body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nLast year I created the Magical Unicorn Typeface: A typeface,
  while flawed, still managed to capture the spirit of these noble animals in graphemes.
  However, it wasn't the end, a continuation of the Unicorn Typeface was a must.\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.arthus.nl/pegacorn/pegacornABC.gif</img>\r\n\r\nThe
  Unicorn-Pegasus letters are an development of the Unicorn font. With the translation
  of the original drawings to the usable Unicorn font, many details disappeared and
  the hand-drawn character was lost. This series of initials is extremely detailed
  and compared to the Unicorn Font, no shapes have been cut. Each Unicorn-Pegasus
  is complete, from the tip of the horn to the far end of the tail. \r\n\r\nWhile
  the images might become available in the future (or become vectorized as a companion
  weight for the Magical Unicorn & Unicorn Sans weights) I hope this approach towards
  type might open the discussion about the requirement of horns or hooves for better
  readability.\r\n\r\nMore information and images can be found on: [[http://www.arthus.nl|my
  portfolio]] or for more images on [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Unicorn-Pegasus-Initials/7721763|Behance]].\r\n"
