		<div class="commentbody">I think the strict definition of &quot;amateur&quot; is in contrast to &quot;professional&quot;, meaning it has to do with making money. So I was a professional font designer at 13 (when I sold my Arabic bitmap fonts for the C64) but some people will persist in calling me &quot;amateur&quot;. Mostly the terms have no objective meaning - they're simply used by insecure people to make themselves feel better by striking others down. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, if professional means academically educated in the specifics of a given field, then I'm not a type designer.  The important thing here is that I really don't believe one requires &quot;academic&quot; training in order to be a professional. <BR> <BR>My introduction to type design is far from the halls of &quot;Any-art-school, U.S.A.&quot;  I came to this profession from the sickeningly pedantic field of hardcore lexicography (having an intense interest in orthographic design and reform&ndash;later the art of the alphabet and its many potential incarnations took lead over the academic linguistics I had begun with). <BR> <BR>What's the point?  You don't need the schooling; you do need to have enough passion to motivate yourself to actually learn something instead of assuming that a copy of Fontographer makes a you a pro. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I'd like to see the look on the face of the fool who tagged the online version of that article if they were ever to see how difficult it is to design a real typeface.</div>
