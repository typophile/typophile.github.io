  set in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/vista_sans_bold/\">Emigre's
  Vista</a>.\r\nI'm particularly interrested with it's very special lowercase 'a'.\r\nit
  should have a double storey 'g'\r\nand round dots.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I need a vista
  serif !\r\n\r\nI hope you can suggest something.\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n+"
