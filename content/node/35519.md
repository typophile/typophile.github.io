  on Advertising\". I bought it in 1983 and it seems even more right today than it
  did then.\r\nI recalled the value he put on type and the importance it plays when
  it's easy to read (at a 2-second glance on the shelf) vs. art - comes down to sell
  the product or win the prize.\r\nWe won the award once \"Global Packaging Design\"
  - beverages - we found we still needed a dollar (OK $5.- at Starbucks) to buy a
  coffee - the award didn't sell the product. \r\nI found this site because we need
  seven EASY to read logos and looking here I can better understand the importance
  of \"ease-of-read\".\r\nThe \"gods of circumstance\" (or google) brought me here
  and I think I'll enjoy it.\r\nGerd\r\n\r\n"

    but it might be helpful nevertheless.
