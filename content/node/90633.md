body: "Hello my friends:\r\n\r\nI have a problem regarding my designed TTF and OTF
  fonts using FontLab software. When I design a font and delete all kerning and metrics
  classes in the fonts, I generate the final TTF and OTF files. After opening them
  again in the FontLab, I found that the same classes are still there and nothing
  has been deleted. I am not sure if the FontLab program that I have working properly
  but it repeats the same classes after my repeated tries of deleting them and generating
  new OTF and TTF files.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do to make these classes deleted permanently
  and not generated again in my generated TTF and OTF?\r\n\r\nI have attached the
  photos which describe my frustrated problem.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9_5284.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/10_6509.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_5589.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/12_4799.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help and guidance.\r\n"

    I have regenerated the kern features after deleting the classes but when I save
    the font and generate it with a new TTF extension, I had also the same problem."

    Export the font features into a .fea file. Now open up the classes panel, and
    rest it -- you'll be getting rid of all classes BTW, not just kerning.\r\n\r\nNow,
    in a text editor,  open up the .fea file you wrote off, and you'll probably notice
    the classes are there, too. Delete whichever classes you don't want -- just the
    kerning classes, probably. You'll also have to delete the kern feature itself,
    not just the class definitions.\r\n\r\nNow, in the font, open up the OT menu.
    Reset the features (essentially clear all). Now use \"open features\" & read in
    your (now edited) .fea file. Complile.\r\n\r\nI'll bet your unwanted kerns are
    gone. There are probably settings within FL that will let you do the same thing;
    I just always work with a text editor in outboarded files, so don't know how to
    set them.\r\n\r\nIf this works, you have no kerning. You can add it in several
    ways -- By using the metrics windows & then use the \"generate kern\" feature
    in the OT features, or by incorporating an external kern feature in the .fea file
    you wrote off, so it is imported along with everything else in the .fea file.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure want you're trying to accomplish, but that should get rid of all the extant
    kerning from when you first opened the font."
