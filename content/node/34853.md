  in some citations. I'm not happy with the one in Adobe Jenson, though, and I was
  thinking of using the one from Centaur instead. I'm concerned it looks a bit too
  thin next to the Jenson numerals. (Then again, the picture below is obviously blown
  up quite a bit.) What do others think? (The example on top uses the Centaur section
  sign; the one on the bottom uses the Adobe Jenson section sign.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sections_4915.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  while we're on the subject, should I use a full word space between the section sign
  and the numerals? It looks a bit too open to me, and I was thinking of using a thin
  space instead. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm just an amateur doing some work
  for a friend, which is why I'm looking for input from experts and professionals!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: 'I''m not quite sure why you want to swap in the Centaur glyph: the Jenson
    is better balanced with the font (note its closer proportions to the ascender
    height of the "6" and the descender depth of the "9", "3", "5"). The Centaur may
    line up better with the parens, but its relationship is to the figures, not the
    parens. The Jenson glyph is also more balanced in terms of its curves, and, of
    course, its weight. Add all of this together and, as above, I don''t quite understand
    the desire to do the swap...'

  body: "If you are going to the trouble of inserting a character from another font,
    you can further nuance it. \r\nFor instance, add a Stroke value of .075 pt to
    beef it up a bit, nudge the baseline shift up by half a point, increase the horizontal
    scaling by 10%, and reduce the point size by half a point. Something like that,
    anyway.\r\n"

  body: "Jason, you're right that the Centaur glyph does not match the height or depth
    of the Jenson numerals, but notice in the picture below that it doesn't match
    the <em>Centaur</em> numerals in that respect either. (This line is set entirely
    in Centaur.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centaur_4401.jpg]\r\nAs to
    why I want to do the swap--frankly, I think the Jenson symbol sign is rather ugly.
    It doesn't match the calligraphic beauty of the rest of the typeface (or something
    like that). The Centaur glyph seems much more elegant.\r\n"

  body: "Nick, thanks for the suggestions. Below is a version adjusted largely according
    to your specifications. I think .075 pt was too much to add to the stroke value.
    What you see on the top line is .05 pt added stroke value, and I think that still
    might be a bit too much. (The bottom line remains unadulterated Adobe Jenson.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Adjusted_5033.jpg]\r\nAny
    thoughts on the space after the section sign? Word space or thin space?"

  body: "Wonder what the Centaur bold section sign would look like, scaled down a
    couple of points? Probably clunky. I never installed Centaur bold when I bought
    Centaur way back when.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd close up the space a bit between
    the section sign and the numerals. Though I'd probably try to find a well-set
    book with this construction to use as an example first."

    is Centaur Bold at 10pt next to Adobe Jenson at 12pt. (There is too much variation
    in stroke width on the Centaur Bold glyph here, I think.)"

  body: "Centaur\u2019s \xA7 proportions won\u2019t simultaneously work with the parentheses
    and numerals of Jenson even with horizontal scaling and increased weight, I can\u2019t
    give an alternative but I imagine a further search is in order. \r\nAs to the
    spacing I would keep the current space, I would also, primarily to assist the
    reader and for consistency, use \u2018pp\u2019 for pages, however is the comma
    between parentheses and \xA7 really necessary? That space might need to be a wide
    space if the comma wasn\u2019t there.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Tim, I think I've already been convinced to stick with the Adobe Jenson section
    sign, inelegant though it seems. (In other words, that's the direction in which
    I'm currently leaving.) I checked the Arno Pro section symbol, and it's even clunkier.\r\n\r\nAs
    for 'pp.', it is--at least in academic publishing--common to leave it out. (See,
    for instance, the Chicago Manual of Style.) There is no worry about consistency,
    since readers know that in the absence of some indication to contrary (\xA7\xA7,
    chap., vol.), the numbers refer to pages.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, in a full footnote citation
    (what I included was only the end of the citation), the comma between the facts
    of publication and the page number(s) is necessary (or at least standard)."
