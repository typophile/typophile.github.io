    set, unless your TV isn't the greatest.\r\n\r\nFor HD quality, if you're watching
    HD television rather than Blu-Ray discs, there are noticeable artifacts from compression
    that can be more or less awful. They bug me as well, although our particular cable
    provider seems to have improved noticeably over time. I remember when I first
    saw it a couple of years ago it was pretty awful.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, cable
    providers are up against some serious overall bandwidth limitations, so they have
    to make quality vs channel count tradeoffs, unless fiber optic becomes more widespread.\r\n\r\nRe-reading
    your note, I wonder if there is some sort of \"sharpness\" setting you need to
    turn off on the TV. It may indeed be doing some kind of unsharp masking....\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    even when I point them out.\r\n\r\nThe splotchiness of standard definition broadcasts
    is the most noticeable. I assume that it's because that type of video was not
    meant to be seen on a flat screen HD set, that when viewed on a CRT at the intended
    resolution, the artifacts are there, but they are not visible. CRT TVs are not
    only lower resolution, but less sharp and brighter. I chalk it up to fundamentally
    different and not fully compatible display technologies.\r\n\r\n(Type looked very
    different on CRT TVs, too.)"

  body: "\"Satellite doesn\u2019t have the severe bandwidth limitations that (coaxial)
    cable has\"\r\n\r\nYes, it does.\r\n\r\nIf you're getting your signal from Cable
    or Satellite, you're not really getting the best possible picture. Both will use
    various levels of compression on the channels. Some 'lesser' channels will be
    compressed to the point of looking like unusable JPGs. Sports and first-run movies
    tend to get the 'bigger pipes'.\r\n\r\nTo fully test if it's your signal or your
    TV settings, hook up the rabbit ears and tune in your local HD PBS station. OTA
    HD isn't compressed so would be the 'purest' signal. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, it sounds
    like you maybe have a bad TV and/or bad settings and/or bad cables. My parents
    had a Samsung for a year before they discovered that the LCD panel had been 'sandwiched'
    wrong in manufacturing adding this odd distortion to the picture. (To samsung's
    credit, they fixed it). \r\n\r\nWhat bothers me the most is people that get the
    new big wide-screen TVs and then don't notice that they're still watching their
    old fuzzy standard def analog cable in stretch-o-vision. Watching Football with
    my FIL is agonizing. ;)"

  body: "For the exact same reasons, I don't like the look of 95% of the LCD TVs -
    HD or otherwise. I generally prefer my old, clear Sony CRT. The problem I find
    is that I spend hours and hours in a day staring at a high-quality, sharp but
    not too sharp, high-res display with reasonable color fidelity, just-right contrast,
    and more brightness that I need most of the time. It's connected to my computer,
    and cost a bundle.\r\n\r\nI'm not prepared to spend that much dough on a high-end
    HD TV (and the bandwidth to support it), so all the options look poor in comparison
    to what I'm used to - too much contrast, bad viewing angle, awful color, image
    outlining, grainy movement. If I really, really want to watch something in HD
    resolution, I'd prefer to buy it, download it in advance, and watch it on my computer.
    Most of the time, though, normal old school CRT and low-res display is fine, and
    much more pleasant to watch.\r\n\r\nThen again, I happened to be staying with
    friends in Dallas while the Beijing olympics were on. They had an excellent screen
    the size of a moose, and an HD satellite feed. It was spectacular - and probably
    very expensive."

    it was the player, because I hadn''t really noticed it with DVDs. But there didn''t

    on the HD set and it was cranked almost all the way up. I turned it all the way
