  body: It looks like a customized version of <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontDev/china.html"
    target="_blank">China</a> &#40;The A is different and it&#39;s been slanted&#41;.
    I did a new font based on this recently called <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/changeling.html"
    target="_blank">Changeling</a>, but it wouldn&#39;t really match your sample.
    I don&#39;t know of an official digitization of China, but there are some unofficial
    versions such as Castcrafters&#39; <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/cgi-bin/castcraft/dc2.02?135%2C256"
    target="_blank">Camp Caps</a>.
