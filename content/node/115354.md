  sans serif fonts that have slanted or angled cuts taken out of the letters - a bit
  like the John Lewis logo.\r\n\r\nAngles could be anything from 30 to 45 degrees.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure I've seen a few things but can't place them?"

  body: So "Def not Interstate" means that interstate doesn't meet your requirements?
    From your description it seems like a perfect fit - why don't you like it? Style,
    license, fear of driving on the freeway, something else?
