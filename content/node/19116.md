body: "This is not a logo but rather an idea which I had. \r\n\r\nSoon my apprenticeship
  ends and I had to apply for a job. So I thought about not making a standard letter
  to write to the agencies but rather just a logo printed on a selfmade postcard.
  So I could write on the back and the guy from the agency could read immediately
  my application. Therefore I could not glue a picture of me on the postcard, so I
  decided to paint myself. So my name should look a little bit like a signature.\r\n\r\nIts
  a bit late now and I want to go to bed but before go to sleep I want to upload my
  current status to hear what you think of it.\r\n\r\nIts just a rough sketch which
  I traced in freehand. Its not cleaned yet. \r\n\r\nBecause the logo only appears
  on a postcard I thought about giving my picture an irregular, selfpainted border
  that let it look like a postage stamp.(only sketched yet)\r\n\r\nSo what do you
  think of it!?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Steven-Wulf-Logo.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Borderline-Logo.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Steven-Wulf-Letter.gif]\r\n\u2026\r\nBye:

  body: "I like the lettering, even if, <em>in this state</em>, it partially still
    seems slightly 'blurry' / 'stroppy' / 'sloppy' <em>( Deutsch: 'Patzig', als wenn
    an diesen Stellen die Farbe zusammenlaufen wuerde. )</em> and too dark <em>( Especially
    the 'l' and 'f'. )</em>, but I am not too sure about the illustration or the combination
    of the two.\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: "Yes, I think that you should add \"counters\" to the \"l\" and \"f\" (like
    the \"e\"\u2026 since they are written with the same kind of loop).\r\n\r\nI like
    your first image. The portrait and your \"signature\" match each other in line
    and style. I don't like the postage stamp border idea\u2026 that is too kitchy."
