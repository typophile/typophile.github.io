body: "<strong> [[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Garamond </strong>\r\n\r\nGaramond is
  the original typographic naming disaster--a source of ongoing confusion. There are
  many types called \"Garamond\", almost to the point where garamond has emerged as
  a category among serif text faces. What most of the Garamonds have in common is
  that they are more-or-less accurate revivals either of type cut by [[Claude Garamond]]
  in the late fifteenth century, or of type cut by [[Jean Jannon]] in the mid-16th
  century.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe basic story is this. A French punchcutter of the
  fifteenth century, Claude Garamond, was held in high esteem. In the early twentieth
  century the producers of matrices for machine setting were keen to revive or recut
  historical typefaces, and several versions of typefaces named for Garamond, and
  supposedly based on his typefaces, were produced: by [[American Type Founders|ATF]]
  in [[1918]], by [[Lanston Type Co.|Lanston Monotype]] (drawn by [[Frederic W. Goudy|Frederic
  Goudy]]) in 1921, and by [[Monotype|English Monotype]] in [[1922]].\r\n\r\nIt turned
  out that the original of these types, then believed to be the work of Claude Garamond,
  were not: they were the work of a different French punchcutter, Jean Jannon. This
  was discovered and made public by [[Beatrice Warde]] in an article for [[The Fleuron]]
  in [[1926]]. But by then the Garamond (or, as Goudy would have it, Garamont) name
  had stuck.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there were and are other revivals (of which the most
  well-known is [[Adobe]] Garamond, designed by [[Robert Slimbach]] ([[1989]])) which
  <em>are</em> based on Claude Garamond's type.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard, when the typefaces
  are seen side-by-side, to identify differences between the various Garamonds, and
  to perceive (broadly) two different \"families\"; but the similarities are quite
  striking too. Generally choice depends on aesthetic preference rather than historical
  correctness. These are usable typefaces with a slight air of conscious refinement
  that appeals to some and repels others.\r\n\r\n<strong>Based on Garamond</strong>:

  Garamond</a> is very much a creature of the 1970s (designed by Tony Stan). It is
  a type which tends to arouse strong feelings (not usually good ones). But even its
  supporters accept that this typeface, with its large [[X-height|x-height]] is a
  Garamond only in name.\r\n\r\nBecause of the profusion of garamond-like typefaces
  and the early confusion around its naming, it is common to see a typeface referred
  to as a garamond, the way we might categorize a typeface as a blackletter or a script.\r\n\r\nIn
  addition to Sabon, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=1&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=verdigris&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=I+%5Bheart%5D+Typowiki\">MvB
  Verdigris</a> is another contemporary face that could be called a garamond.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
