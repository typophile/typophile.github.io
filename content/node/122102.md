  Larger scale character set attached. More info \r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?2DOO\r\nWhen
  we look at the glyphs we see the multitude of nodes that is characteristic of auto-traced
  letters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PickworthOSRR_R_4974.jpg]\r\nI appreciate
  that the original might have been a \"rugged\" design, that today we would call
  antique, grunge or distressed.\r\nI don't recognize the font by its original name
  from about a century ago. My searches for the term \"Pickworth\" online and in  my
  few reference books turns up nothing identical except the Red Rooster digital font.
  I know of a fair number of similar fonts, such as Post -- digitized in a slick version
  by Nick Curtis as Saturday Morning Toast  https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/saturday-morning-toast/
  \  but I am trying track down this particular design.\r\nI would welcome any suggestions
  as to the old time font name and its source.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"

  body: "Many thanks Kevin for the \"Antique No 14\" reference. Dan X. Solo often
    used names for the fonts he purchased that differed from the original name, but
    I suspect that this one could perhaps be unchanged from the original. It gives
    me something I can use while going through old source names. Sounds like the type
    of font name that would have been used by a foundry like Central, Bruce or Conner\r\nAlso
    thanks for the reference to the polished version by Nick Curtis. Some differences
    in the letter-forms due to editing but obviously based on the same font.\r\nThe
    Peter Dako digital font of 1991 identifies it as \"Hunt SpeedBall.\" This seems
    to suggest a source in one of the Hunt lettering books.\r\nSpeculating: Hunt lettering
    based on an old foundry font called \"Antique No 14\" ??? Or no old foundry, just
    the Hunt lettering??? Should find a Hunt book and see if it is there and if so
    whether he calls it \"Speedball\" or \"Antique No 14\" ....\r\nThe Steffmann digital
    font of 2000 is a clone ripped from the Dako font. I standardized the sizing and
    found the pattern of points in the outlines are the same, allowing for errors
    resulting from conversions back and forth; including the sequence of lines and
    curves in the digital outlines. \r\nThe quest continues\r\nDon"

    "60 Alphabets"in 1931 and reprinted in numerous editions (My copy is sixth edition
    1944) It is called Modern German Bold.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ModGermPoster_3711.jpg]

    \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hunt44ModernGermanBold_R80pct_5065.jpg]\r\n
    and comparing it to the digital outline of Red Rooster's Pickford Old Style suggests
    that this could peraps be the source they used for the digital font. I see similarities
    in where the bumps occur, but I also see differences.\r\nThis is another lead
    to follow to the source of this design, perhaps in Germany. Bauer, S&G etc. In
    any case, this confirms that the design is pre-1931.\r\nDon\r\n"
