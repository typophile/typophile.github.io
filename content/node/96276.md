  the script/calligraphic font used for \"Chocolate\" and \"tea at three\" in the
  graphic at the top of the page. A different designer created this logo 12 years
  ago. By the time I took over as committee chair for this event, no one could even
  remember who designed the event logo, much less the font. \r\n\r\nThanks for any
  assistance you can provide,\r\nAnne "

    are all different, so I could be wrong but my opinion is this is not a font but
    just a custom logo/drawing.\r\n\r\nFivos"

  body: I was hoping it was a font with alternate glyphs, or at least a font where
    someone had manually modified a couple of the letters. :-(
