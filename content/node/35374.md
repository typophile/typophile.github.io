  I've recently started trying to design a typeface. In my current college they don't
  push us to do typeface design so I've started to learn the basics by myself.\r\nThis
  is my first go and I would like some C&C from all of you. I've ordered already some
  books to learn more about it.\r\nI'm quite glad to join this community.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Lu\xEDs, get along with your font. Looks quite original. But try to keep
    those letters and ciphers in about the same width. Letter \"K\" and the cipher
    \"9\" are too narrow.  The \"4\" looks a bit strange (but that's my personal opinion).\r\nRalph"

  body: "a good concept piece from the bent-wire school of design. Some of the transitions
    from straights to curves seem a bit abrupt, and the K and X seem a bit bottom-heavy
    due to the reverse-bends inherent in the design concept.\r\n\r\nBut I like it
    overall. Sure, it needs tweaking, but I can see it serving well in display text
    for an electronics ad, or some such."

  body: "Hey Ralph. Thanks for the input. The 4 was already redone and I've forgot
    to update it. You can see it in this post attachment. Other than that, the main
    thing is width right? I've tried to keep it unchangeable but in some letters I've
    had to change it :S\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grelha1_6188.jpg]"

    bent wire kind of thing. but I guess it is :) Yeah the I have to tweak those characters
    with too much bending.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    if you can, post a link or something like that.\r\n\r\nhere's I've updated some
    of the letters. what do you think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grelha1_5975.jpg]"

    S bigger.

  body: "\"S\" is too horizontal in the middle. I'd make it slightly downward-angled.
    It also looks too vertically mirrored/symmetric. Top of S is normally always a
    bit smaller depending on the typeface.\r\n\r\nW and K should be a bit wider, B,
    J and P a bit narrower.\r\n\r\nApply the same top/bottom principle as with the
    \"S\" to the \"3\" and \"8\". \"9\" and \"4\" should be wider."

  body: "Ok. About the regular version. the changes on letters are better. But. \"S\"
    is a bit too wide on the top curve. It's smaller when it comes to the height (compared
    to the bottom half) but still too wide.\r\n\r\n\"K\" much better. \"P\" should
    maybe be somewhere in between the original and this last version.\r\n\r\n\"3\"
    is better, but the top half goes too much to the right. \"8\" has to be corrected
    on the bottom curve because it has a bump.\r\n\r\n\"4\" and \"9\" are still too
    narrow. Try to narrow the \"R\" and \"5\" a bit.\r\n\r\nRegarding the bold version...
    It's not completely the same family. You joined many lines together that are separate
    in the regular weight. And some additional comments: \"2\" is too heavy on the
    top half (curve goes too down), \"4\", \"7\" and \"9\" are way too narrow in this
    weight, "

  body: "\"8\": bottom bowl is not round on the right side.\r\n\r\nMaybe widen the
    \"7\" too... I'm still not too sure about \"0\" (zero)... Is it too wide or not.
    I know it's similar to \"O\" but... Maybe it should be a bit narrower. Try and
    see for yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd I suggest you start working with texts because you'll
    see the differences and contrast problems more quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd there are also
    some curve problems (not smooth curves) with some of your letters... There seems
    to be something going on with the top line (before it goes into a curve) with
    \"P\", \"R\" and \"5\" (middle line)\r\n\r\nTop arms of \"E\" and \"F\" are not
    horizontal. They are going a bit downwards.\r\n\r\nMinor minor changes.\r\n\r\nLet's
    see what others will say."
