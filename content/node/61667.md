body: Can anyone tell me what font this is? It's very similar to Park Avenue, but
  the letters are joined and the r extends all the way to the baseline.

  body: "It appears to be a variation of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/park+avenue/fonts/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26seed%3D26%26dock%3D0%26size%3D72%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DPrimarily%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga\">Park
    Avenue</a> with alterations to \"r\" and \"y\".\r\n\r\nAfter more research it
    appears a little closer to <a href=\"http://www.webpagepublicity.com/free-fonts-p.html\">Park
    Place</a> which has softer curves on the \"y\"."

  body: I know that it looks like Park Avenue, However the letters are joined together
    and the lowercase r is extended all the way to the baseline on the left hand side.
    I didn't know if there was another font that looked like Park Avenue but had these
    attributes.
