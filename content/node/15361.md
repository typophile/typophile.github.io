  _\r\n\r\nAfter the very low \"attendance\" of the second one I started wondering
  if there should be more of these... But then I saw an \"f\" that needs a reverse
  nose job of elephantine proportions:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/meridien/roman/charmap.html\r\n\r\nMeridien
  is possibly Matthew Carter's most favorite font.* I really really like it too, from
  the moment I saw it. It has a regal but reserved \"je ne sais quoi\" that's as easy
  to admire as it is difficult to really wrap your head around. It was originally
  a metal font, but not a Monotype, plus the italic \"f\" is pretty good, so I really
  have to wonder what happened with that \"f\"... Unless we can think of some reason
  that the original form is ideally valid, I say let's try to make a better one.\r\n\r\n*

  body: 'Hrant, according to the info at MyFonts, Apollo is the Monotype version of
    Meridien. Meridien I assume was done first for linotype machines, which is the
    reason for the squashed f (and j). Both the f and j are ''fixed'' in Apollo, as
    you can see <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/apollo/mt/charmap.html">here</a>.
    Whether you like it or not is another matter, but going in that direction was
    my first thought when I looked at it. So to me, Apollo fixes the problems you
    (rightly I think) see in Meridien. '

  body: "> Apollo is the Monotype version of Meridien.\r\n\r\nI saw that, but they're
    really not very close - at least not to us type geeks. :-)  And one appeal of
    this type of effort to me is the -admittedly small- possibility of practical improvement,
    in terms of maybe providing some typographers with an alternate glyph (without
    treading on the original's rights); and Meridien is much more commonly available
    than Apollo. That said, it's certainly possible to look at Apollo's \"f\" for
    guidance.\r\n\r\nBTW, from what I understand Meridien was first done for D&P,
    so cold metal (no kerning limitations). On the other hand, Frutiger could have
    been \"designing ahead\" to eventual Linotype conversion. But then how to explain
    the italic \"f\" being decent?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I didn't actually compare the two, except for the f and j. Looking again
    I see the serifs and contrast are handled differently. Still, something like the
    solution on the f and j would work...\r\n\r\nReading at the Linotype site, it
    says that Apollo was designed for phototype, which may explain some of the changes.
    \r\n\r\nIt also says that Meridien is Frutiger's favorite of his typefaces. I
    wonder if the f was simply designed to avoid kerning, even in foundry type, so
    it would be more robust.  \r\n\r\nComparing Meridien and Apollo is actually quite
    interesting; thanks for highlighting this. "
