  body: "I'd say, start with the descriptions available at the Adobe Type store (below),
    and visit a good library. At least two specimen books were published, one in October
    1992 for Minion Cyrillic, and the other in October 1993 for Minion MM. Unfortunately
    none of them are available in digital format. In addition, Adobe has published
    type catalogues and type reference books over the years. By analyzing these you
    will get a good perspective of how this type family evolved. You probably will
    also want to put Minion in the context of the Adobe Originals program.\r\n\r\n<quote>Minion
    is a 1990 Adobe Originals typeface by Robert Slimbach. Minion is inspired by classical,
    old style typefaces of the late Renaissance, a period of elegant, beautiful, and
    highly readable type designs. Created primarily for text setting, Minion combines
    the aesthetic and functional qualities that make text type highly readable with
    the versatility of digital technology. The Minion family contains a black weight,
    display, and swash fonts, expert sets, and a full range of ornaments, for uses
    that range from limited-edition books to newsletters to packaging. U.S. Patents
    Des. 337,604; Des. 371,799; and Des. 338,907.</quote>\r\n<em>in http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=143</em>\r\n\r\nNOTE:
    In addition to the patents mentioned above, U.S. Patents D497,175 S (Oct. 12,
    2004) and D497,630 S (Oct. 26, 2004), also relate to Minion.\r\n\r\n<quote>Minion
    Pro is an Adobe Original typeface designed by Robert Slimbach. The first version
    of Minion was released in 1990. Cyrillic additions were released in 1992, and
    finally the OpenType Pro version was released in 2000. Minion Pro is inspired
    by classical, old style typefaces of the late Renaissance, a period of elegant,
    beautiful, and highly readable type designs. Minion Pro combines the aesthetic
    and functional qualities that make text type highly readable with the versatility
    of OpenType digital technology, yielding unprecedented flexibility and typographic
    control, whether for lengthy text or display settings. The full Minion Pro family
    contains three weights and two widths, each with optical size variants, and each
    supporting a full range of Western languages, including Greek and Cyrillic. With
    its many ligatures, small caps, oldstyle figures, swashes, and other added glyphs,
    Minion Pro is ideal for uses ranging from limited-edition books to newsletters
    to packaging.</quote>\r\n<em>in http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1719</em>\r\n"

  body: "The story of the evolution of Minion would be one worth telling, I think,
    because it represents the ongoing problem-solving of Slimbach, one of our best
    designers of text faces. \r\n\r\nFor [[http://www.typophile.com/node/2989|this
    thread]] back in 2004 I did a PDF comparing Minion and Minion Pro. I think Slimbach
    subtly but decisively improved the face in that upgrade. \r\n\r\nMinion tries
    really hard to be economical, packing the most letters in the smallest space.
    J-F Porchez pointed out that it is intended to be a rival to Times New Roman in
    that respect. Aesthetically, I think something was given up for the sake of economy,
    but I think you have to admit that it is one of the great workhorse faces of our
    times, with huge glyph coverage (including Greek and Cyrillic), optical sizes,
    four number styles, many weights, and even a condensed version. "

    the display?
