body: This is my font, called Virus.  The idea was to juxtapose thick, semi-organic
  marks with thin rectilinear lines to create a technological feel. <BR>Any comments
  would be appreciated. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7546.gif"

  body: Kind of reminds me of DNA slides. <BR> <BR>The differentiation between letters
    is kinda low. I&#39;m trying to figure out if i can read them because I know the
    alphabet or because the characters are actually legible. Can you print some titles
    out and so we can see how it works?  <BR> <BR>Graham

  body: I think a name change is fine because I think you should take another look
    at it. <BR> <BR>It feels way more analog to me than you give it credit. <BR> <BR>It
    reminds me of those snap apart pieces that you might find in a model kit. <BR>

  body: Sorry it took awhile to reply, I was on spring break without my computer.
    I changed the name slightly to avoid copyright issues. Hopefully it is clear enough
    to read, optimizing it doesn&#39;t keep integrity.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7971.gif"
    alt=""> <BR>Obviously, this is about as small as it would be used. If you&#39;d
    like to see a larger version, let me know.

  body: I liked what Graham said about it looking like DNA markings... I almost wonder
    if MORE analog would be better?

  body: the letterforms Looks a bit like ribosomes as well. Would it be possible to
    open the counter width of the O up the same as the U?
