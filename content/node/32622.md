  also done an\r\nillustration in illustrator and brought it into Photoshop but i
  want to fill it\r\nwith the priece of material so it will look like that the shoe
  is made of that material. How do I\r\ngo about it? Is it something like mask off
  the area outside teh shoe and something? I'd like to knw\r\nthe easy and real way.
  Not the 'use lasso tool and go round the shoe an ddelete every\r\nlittle bit of
  material etc etc'. thank you. Please guide me. I really appreciate your help.\r\nThanks.\r\n"

  body: "I'd probably use a layer mask, either on the material layer or the shoe layer,
    depending on the  situation and which one is easier.\r\n\r\nWhy not just import
    the scanned material photo into Illustrator? Or are you planning on working on
    it a bit more in Photoshop?"

  body: I was thinking maybe Illustrator would be easier if I am right? Do I use some
    sort of pathfinder tool I think. I'm not sure. Is it easier in Illustrator? Thanks.

  body: "if you have an image of a shoe and an image of material, open them both in
    photoshop. select the area of shoe you want to fill with the new material using
    either the lasso (sorry, but that's how you do it!) or the magic wand or both.
    once the area is selected, go to other image, select all and copy,back to shoe
    and edit--paste into.\r\nbut they should be teaching you this in school. it's
    not a difficult task."

  body: In Illustrator you should have a duplicate of the outline of the illustration
    you want to fill. Then place a photoshop picture under it, select both and choose
    make compound path. Move the new compound path under everything else, so you'll
    get to keep possible details and outlines. Note, that these items should not have
    fills...

  body: "Assuming the shoe shape is an enclosed line, copy from illustrator and paste
    into photoshop, first as a path and then again as pixels, so you now have a layer
    with the shoe illustration and a background layer, between the two copy and paste
    the scanned material into a layer and create a layer mask (reveal all), go to
    your path drop down menu and using the option in the top right create a selection
    from the path, then inverse the selection and fill with black. If you need to
    move the material scan remember to unlink the scan layer and the layer mask.\r\n\r\nThere
    are many ways of doing this, depending on the final use, for example, I would
    also consider doing it as Mili suggests except making your duplicate illustrator
    path a compound path and then placing your material scan behind the path, select
    both and make clipping mask.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "<em>the easy and real way</em> \u2013 really not necessarily (nor likely
    to be) the same thing at all. RTFM Miss G! or failing that get a book like 'Real
    World Photoshop' to learn from...\r\n\r\nWhich technique you employ for this depends
    very much on your intended outcome; \r\n1. if you want the material to appear
    as a flat shape delineated by the outline of a shoe, then Illustrator.\r\n2. if
    you want the material to appear as if it follows the contours of a shoe in three
    dimensions, then Photoshop.\r\n\r\nAs I've just reread your original post and
    it seems like 2. applies, so then a fair amount of layer-masking, adjustment layers
    and freehand addition of shadows and highlights will be inevitable if you want
    to achieve a realistic effect. \r\n\r\nI notice that no-one else here says you
    should be working with anti-aliased or feathered selections to keep the edges
    soft and natural-looking, or that you should be working with different layer blending
    modes (shadows=multiply, highlights=screen) and opacities."

    Illy has had a groovy little feature called the Gradient Mesh for a while now
    Ben - perhaps you don't use Illy as a graphics app? Here's just one of a dozen
    or so Illy artist I know that can contour anything: http://www.khulsey.com/masters_yukio_miyamoto.html
    .\r\n\r\n2. Yeah ok, but Ps can do flat with the best of 'em.\r\n\r\nmissgiggles,
    in Ps there's at least three solid different ways of doing most things - so...
    I'll suggest after you have used a clipping path, try using the Dodge and Burn
    tools to give the textile some depth. And for an advanced depth technique, I can't
    leave without suggesting the Ps Displace filter, and for that - here's the funkiest
    tutorial around: \r\nhttp://thegoldenmean.com/technique/displace1.html\r\n\r\n__________\r\nHiro"
