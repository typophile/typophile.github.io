		<div class="commentbody">I never used to care for Helvetica, but I didn't dislike it particularly either. It just wasn't an aesthetic I had any interest in. I always thought, and still think, that the use of Helvetica for text in wide columns on glossy-paged books of the early '70s was hideous and unreadable, but as a heading and display face it seemed to work okay.  <BR>  <BR>Then I had the great pleasure of being commissioned to design a new Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew for Helvetica, which obliged me to spend a lot more time looking at the design than I had previously. I'm still not inclined to make much use of Helvetica, but I have a lot more respect for it than I used to. One of the things I really came to appreciate was the sheer quirkiness and unpredictability of what most people think of as a very rationalised and geometric design. It's actually pleasantly perverse.  <BR>  <BR>Note that I'm talking here about the original Helvetica. Helvetica Neue is a completely different design: superior in almost every way, but much less quirky.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Helvetica is mostly a victim of its success. Designers get tired of seeing the same typefaces over and over. I can't think of any typefaces that have become as popular as Helvetica that have not had the same over-exposure problem with designers. I used to like Times Roman a lot more before it became a default font.  <BR>  <BR>As a young proto-designer in high school in the '70s, I was infatuated with Helvetica. My first sheet of Letraset was a sheet of 72-point Helvetica Medium, and I remember marveling over the subtle curves or the lowercase <i>a, e,</i> and <i>s.</i> My design teacher in college said &quot;when in doubt, use Helvetica.&quot; I, like many others I think, imagined it as some kind of ultimate standard that all others were to be judged by; that it was a typeface with all the pretensions of style and ornamentation peeled away.   <BR>  <BR>I grew out of my infatuation (or got bored with it) within a couple of years as I became more acquainted with the charms of other typefaces. But I can still remember a time when I imagined that in a perfect world everything would be set in Helvetica. (Ha! Heaven help us.) <BR>  <BR>I mostly think it's boring now, though I find that the way it has come back into fashion is interesting, were it's brought to center stage again. I couldn't use it like that without feeling ironic. Helvetica used to represent end of style. Now it's just another style.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the strength of Helvetica is that it HAS no individuality. Overused to death and mundande and &ndash; thanks to Monotypes Arial bastardization of Akzidenz and Helv &ndash; everyday in fron of half the population of the world, I think there is not a single typeface in the world that is more bland. And I really have started to love that quality. Sometymes you just don't WANT a typeface with personality. Sometimes a grey suit is just the right thing and you don't need the lavender-striped piece.  <BR>I remember that I hated Helv for most of the 80s and early 90s. But most of the so-called replacements like, say, already look old-fashioned, as their aesthetic is so much coined by the times they were created in, while the Helvetica still looks fresh, maybe because it looks so 60s bland and neutral.  <BR> <BR>I think its a bad choice for corporate design, and I'm burdened with two clients who use Helvetica so I know what I'm talking about, but it is often perfect for jobs that have such a strong photographic or design impact that any kind of playful type would just be too much . The classicist static and stoic Helvetica is just the right counterpoint here. Just as I find that Futura, which I hated with just as much fervor, is sometimes dead right in creating a certain</div>

While I personally think that such a thing is unlikely to actually happen and also that it isn't wrong at all to get between those two and to interpret and act as a catalysator in the communicative process, it seems that Miedinger succeeded in making Helvetica very very invisible. I think it says a LOT about German companies that they're so in love (or simply used to) this typeface&hellip; and I think that as a designer we shouldn't take Helv as granted but look for alternatives&hellip; but sometimes there simply is none. I know of know other typeface, except maybe DIN that is as sterile and functional as Helv&hellip; And in a minimalist design you WANT a typeface to look that way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">HD Schellnack: <BR><i>Some day somebody will get the right idea and give  <BR>the Helvetica Ligatures, Small Caps and OSFs. It  <BR>would give the font a whole new dimension of irony.</i> <BR> <BR> <BR>Ten years ago I designed a set of lowercase figures for  <BR>Neue Helvetica 75. It was used, exclusively, in the <BR>signage for an exhibition: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7811.gif" alt="neue H 75&#44; lc figs"> <BR> <BR>But there was nothing new here, in fact. Akzidenz Grotesk, <BR>the mother of all Helveticas, had already had lc figures <BR>for some time (but only in the &quot;light&quot; weight, curiously). <BR> <BR>I don't think, BTW, that this was such a necessary thing <BR>(small caps would be particularly pathetic). In my case,  <BR>the motivation was to follow the exhibition logo, designed  <BR>by Goebel Weyne, a great designer here: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7812.gif" alt="ESdi30"> <BR> <BR>In the case of Futura (and Gill Sans!) the lc figures are, <BR>on the other hand, essential, in my opinion. I haven't seen <BR>the de Groot figures that you mention. The original Renner <BR>ones, as released by The Foundry, are perfect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Thanks. I much prefer the original one, though.  <BR> <BR>Hmm, while the originals add to the 30s flair of the type, I think that Luc(as) version is more straightforward and the OSFs are more non-descript, fitting better in with a modern text and the clean cool look of the Futura. I don't know about the Foundry version, but the Neufville release doesn't wow me much, it's just too retro to be of practical use today. Luc's version retains a very modern touch.  <BR> <BR>Re Tv-Channel-Identification. I've been to an expo on the history of TV some years back and noticed that almost everything looked better designed and simpler and &hellip; just moe beautiful&hellip; in the early days of TV as a mass-medium. The 50s/60s screendesign, although there were terrible poopers as well, it just felt more relaxed than the overcoloured overanimated stuff we have today.  <BR> <BR>By the way, most German TV-stations use Helvetica or something similar. The ARD uses the Thesis whole clan, which works surprisingly well on screen. Almost every show has its ID done in some of the Thesis fonts&hellip; and this gives us a coherent look yet still offers the single shows some individuality.</div>

I have to agree. There are one too many copies of 3Dmax running on this planet. :^) <BR> <BR>RE: Futura and OSF <BR> <BR>This is strictly  my opinion, but I really think that the OSF goes against how I view Futura as a typeface. OSF are not decoration I do understand that. They serve a very specific purpose typographically. But I still think they seem a little OTT for a face that stands (stood?) for sterility in design.

In a sentence one (you or myself) usually doesn't want the figures standing tall over the other characters. The OSF do blend nicely.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Also what does &quot;Anti-Renaissance-statement&quot; &gt;means?  <BR>I think Renner et al wanted the new typography of the 1920s as a concious statement against the typographic look coined by Venetian and French Renaissance. While Futura harkens back to the Capitalis Monumentalis in  that it is based on circles and squares as base forms, it is a geometric contruction, done with compasses and ruler, not created in a more dynamic way by hand with a nib/pen. That is what I mean by sterile. Although the finished version, of course, is by no way as regid as the first designs (the o, e.g., isn't just a circle anymore but rather returned to the slightly oval form we know since the 14th century to be optically correct, it still, imo, was a statement against the old-fashioned typography that went before the 20th century.  <BR> <BR>The digital Futura, btw, isn't too good for longer text, I think. The digial version needs a lot of manual kerning because of the geometric shape of the letters, and while with a LOT of manual editing you can get a decent looking text, it's just too much work to bother. Also, I tend to think that a more dynamic letterform is just more gentle on the reader :-D. I couldn't imagine reading a book or a lengthy article in Futura, even Helvetica would be better.</div>

The long ascenders/descenders, geometric construction and incoherence of the letterforms lack flow and making reading very uncomforable. The text figures help, but not by much. <BR> <BR>&lt;i&gt;In the very &quot;Trajanian&quot; proportion of its caps, its quite  <BR>traditional vertical proportions (small body, long extenders), Futura doesn't seem to me that  disconnected from a Renaissance lineage even.&lt;i&gt; <BR> <BR>I agree. The caps certainly owe a lot to the Trajan Roman caps (and to the caps of Edward Johnston's Underground type and Gill Sans), but the lowercase to me doesn't say a lot about the Renaissance ? quite purely geometric. It's funny how Gill Sans really didn't catch on in continental Europe and North America in the 20/30s&hellip; people preferred the modernity of Futura, so Monotype made an 'alternate' version of Gill Sans, but it really was just a close imitation of Futura&hellip; <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

I could answer that, as in most   <BR>cases, how one sets it is what matters most. Just  <BR>one of these days I was seeing a book, published  <BR>in the early fifties, set in Futura, a very clean, not   <BR>darkish, metal composition, well leaded.

In fact, I was referring to proportions, not  <BR>the shapes themselves. I'm with St. Bernard de Clairvaux  <BR>on this: proportions are what matter.  <BR>  <BR>BTW, are you saying that the Gill Sans caps were an   <BR>actual influence in the development of Futura?

		<div class="commentbody"><b>&hellip;in most cases, how one sets it is what matters most. Just  <BR>one of these days I was seeing a book, published  <BR>in the early fifties, set in Futura, a very clean, not  <BR>darkish, metal composition, well leaded. It was very  <BR>nice and invited reading.</b> <BR> <BR>Oh, sure. It depends on which cut of Futura too. Not enough leading is generally the problem for Futura. Metal Futura could be really nice. But the trouble is, a lot of people use Adobe's Futura, which really isn't good for text setting. <BR> <BR><b>Thank God, no?</b> <BR> <BR>Yes! And it shows how geometric the construction of Roman Capitals is and how adaptable it is to 'modern' type. <BR> <BR><b>I was referring to proportions, not the shapes themselves.</b> <BR> <BR>Me too. In fact that's what Renner wanted to achieve: to reference classical proportions, and let the grometrical principles behind the construction of the letters cohere them together. 'It is not little marks, rather it is the &quot;spiritual bond&quot; that binds the many individual marks into a unity of form.' (From Chris Burke's <i>Paul Renner: the art of typography</i>) <BR> <BR><b>proportions are what matter.</b> <BR> <BR>Yes, but it's not everything. Subtle details of Futura made it a really good type, not just its proportions. Look at how bowls join the stems. Every detail mattered.  <BR> <BR><b>BTW, are you saying that the Gill Sans caps were an actual influence in the development of Futura? I'd like to know about references for this, if you have them. Thanks.</b> <BR> <BR>No, I have no evidence to support that. But lineage could be made between Johnston's type/calligraphic teaching and Futura, maybe?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that Helvetica has stong virtues and terrible weaknesses. Its virtue is that it is very stong as a display type, while retaining some grace. Its weakness is that it is one of the most unreadable typefaces as a text face. Its value as a display face has, however, been almost totally eliminated by overuse.  <BR> <BR>Even in display sizes, it can have problems with readability. Frutiger's opening up of letter forms in a Sans Serif certainly helped readability, and has been widely imitated.  <BR> <BR>Still, I wouldn't be surprised that if after 10 or 15 years, it couldn't be used judiciously as a display type and look very good again.</div>
