body: What makes a typographic CV interesting? How would it be typographically correct
  to impress an employer to take me on for a work placement? Does it concern the typeface
  I use? The type size? The way I would emphasise certain type for i.e headings etc.
  How else can I make it typographically interesting? Do you think using type to make
  up images would be exciting? What other ways could I do it? Thanks.

  body: "You hadn't said what type of place you're applying to. Like if you were applying
    for a position in a graphic design department in a large non-graphic company,
    the person judging your resume would not be graphically aware.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    in this case I think you have a little bit of room for impressing, but not much,
    and you have to tread pretty carefully: too little is better than too much (assuming
    you have a good chance at getting the job based solely on the content of the resume).
    In terms of the font, I would choose something very under-used but understated
    and highly readable. Not Times, but not Mrs Eaves either.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    resume can't be impressive, but be sure to focus first and formost on communicating.
    That, alone, will make it impressive.

    something interactive would impress and I once asked about my cubed CV idea on
    here and most people said it's more impressive to have a well typed CV than something
    interactive. So would you employers out there still agree on that or not?

    I ignored that advice and did a rip-off of the London underground map as I was
    looking for work experience with an information design company. My work experience
    lasted about 7 years and was the job from heaven. And why did they look at my
    CV? because it was two things: different and relevant. It's a comment I hear over
    and over from Creative Directors I chat to that they are looking for an indication
    that someone has a passion for what they do. Their time is limited so at least
    give them a reason to look at what you send!"

    interactive' is fine, but don't make that your resume. The resume is a practical
    piece of design. It has a specific function. Good design has to be applicable
    design. \r\n\r\nNow, a truly different CV (like f&c mentions) CAN work wonders.
    The catch is that you REALLY have to pull it off well. And that's hard. There's
    a spectrum:\r\n\r\nA-----------------------------------------------------Z\r\n\r\nA
    = practical, well layed out, one page, type-only resume.\r\n\r\nZ = some crazy
    intelligent avante garde interactive CV.\r\n\r\nA & Z are both great. Anything
    in between, though, can fail miserably. ;o)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    will spot good candidates and will be bombarded with these things in the next

    the CV straightforward.
