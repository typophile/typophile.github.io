Some of the simpler ones might be done with some other app, but the majority is pure AE. Which isn&rsquo;t even so difficult by the way, if you have experience with timeline- and keyframe-based apps, you should be able to make a couple of animations in a day or two. Not as perfect as the Pulp Fiction animation of course, but still pretty decent. I have made a couple of kinetic-type movies, done in a week or so, without any experience with the program. (I did know Premiere and Flash, so then AE is not too difficult). If you don&rsquo;t have experience with such apps, then it will take more time to learn.</p>
<p>I will see if I can upload my movs somewhere, but they&rsquo;re about 150mb, and I don&rsquo;t want to compress it too badly.</p>

<p>I have done a few of these as well, and I also think After Effects is the best way to go. Motion from Apple is also a great program, but I still think AE is better based on its price and the fact that most of us are already familiar with Adobe programs. I would also get a book and teach yourself, it isn&rsquo;t too hard. That is how I learned. Also the CS3 version of AE is going to be insane, they have fixed so many things that made it a frusterating program to deal with before, I would try and get the CS3 version if possible.</p>

<p>Using 3D apps to do your animation can work well, but they won’t be nearly as easy to learn as After Effects. In terms of application design, After Effects is just like Photoshop with keyframe animation and a scripting system tacked on, which makes is extremely easy to learn, at least if you’re already familiar with Photoshop. 3D apps tend to be much more complex. Previous versions of Flash have never been able to export working movies, just SWF files, so unless this changed in CS3 Flash isn’t the best choice. And because of the way Flash handles in-between frames, it can also be a PITA to do serious animation in because it requires extra steps for no good reason other than the original programmers were absolutely horrible application/UI designers.</p>

<p>Theoretically it does, but the files are often garbage if not unplayable. I was never able to get a working Quicktime movie of any kind out of Flash 8, no matter what I did. After Effects, on the other hand, has never failed to render me a working Quicktime file.</p>

<p>If you enjoy programming it’s probably worth a shot, otherwise you might end up sinking a lot of time into figuring things out. It’s worth noting that their code is from 2002 and doesn’t come with much in the way of compilation instructions, so unless you enjoying fighting to build a binary, it’s gonna be nasty.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did stumble across <a href="http://www.jahshaka.org/">Jahshaka</a>, an open-source editing and effects suite that looks promising. I’m getting ready to put together a video clip this week, so I’ll be giving it a try. Here’s <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=24035&package_id=32439&release_id=452564">a link to the binaries over at Sourceforge</a>.</p>
<p>I am wondering if Youtube will spark Adobe to release an “After Effects Elements” for people who want to mess around with animation and video effects, but don’t have a need for all the high-end tools built into the not-remotely-inexpensive Standard and Professional versions. If they don’t do it soon, Apple will.</p>

<p>After Effects is what you need to learn. I set out to learn how to make &ldquo;kinetic&rdquo; type videos about a year and a half ago, and managed to make a few I was happy with (for the most part).</p>
<p>Lynda.com has pretty good courses for this. But some of the best online training out there (which happens to be FREE) can be found at video copilot. Start here: <a href="http://www.videocopilot.net/basic/">http://www.videocopilot.net/basic/</a></p>
<p>Here is another tutorial which helped me a lot with timing: <a href="http://www.crookedgremlins.com/09/01/2008/kinetic-typography-tutorial/">http://www.crookedgremlins.com/09/01/2008/kinetic-typography-tutorial/</a></p>
