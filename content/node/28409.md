body: "What's generally considered better form when spacing paragraphs - following
  the paragraph with a full space using the same leading as the rest, or manually
  leading the space between the paragraphs to slightly less than a full line? \r\n\r\nI
  was taught to use manual leading, but it's recently been pointed out to me that
  not only is doing it this way a pain in the neck when layout changes, but that it
  also breaks up the alignment of baselines in pages with multiple columns of text.
  I'm inclined to agree with the latter\u2013but what's generally preferred by typographers?"

    just look better with manual leading if you know what I mean."

  body: "I'm with Stephen when it comes to InDesign.\r\n\r\nMy general rule-of-thumb
    is to add 50% space after a paragraph than leading: i.e., 10 pt text, 12 pt leading,
    18 pt space after each paragraph for body text.  Of course, that depends on the
    face....\r\n\r\nSetting heads is different: I usually use a mix of Space Before
    and Space After to account for times when you have various levels of heads with
    text following them.\r\n\r\nAs always when dealing with stuff like this, YMM,
    and certainly W, V."

  body: "Certainly I agree with you, William, that book settings such as novels do
    not want, or need, secondary lead between paragraphs.\r\n \r\nThe argument is
    that a full return can be excessive when secondary lead between paragraphs is
    used. This is especially true in multi-column settings with narrow gutters. And
    yet we still want the first line and the last line, in multiple columns, to be
    aligned. Therefore we need to add space (or delete space) between lines and between
    paragraphs to *justify* the depth of each column (or *feather* it, as Felici defines
    it). "

  body: "50% extra leading is good, you can still make the lines even, then, by adding
    150% extra leading before a subhead or something.\r\n\r\nThus, in the case of
    10/12 pt. text and 18 pt. space between paragraphs, the space before sub heads
    should be 30 pt., so that:\r\n\r\n50% + 150% = 200% (a multiple of the leading)\r\n\r\nOr
    if you can control the text matter, make sure that every page has an <em>even</em>
    number of space-inbetweens, so that:\r\n\r\n50% + 50% = 100%\r\n50% + 50% + 50%
    + 50% = 200%\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThis might impede the overall color of the page, especially
    when seen through the paper, but at least you'll get an even baseline down at
    the bottom margin.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what page of <em>The Elements</em> was this
    taken from? I remember that Bringhurst have said it somewhere."

    regret using anything other than no extra space, or a whole line space between
    paragraphs, as soon as any edits are made to the text.

    an indent on paras after the first, which is a good alternative for extended text.\r\n\r\nI
    also go for half line spacing in multi-column work (I use align to the baseline
    grid as well as space after values), I far prefer non-aligning bottom lines of
    columns to adjusting leading to align because it's not always practicable and
    it affects the colour within the text. For single column work I think you can
    use a different figure and rely on the inner margins to separate the columns sufficiently
    for non-aligning lines across the pages to be unnoticeable, added to which in
    a high-volume, low-budget run it is rare for the pages to exactly align.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I usually use indented first line of paragraphs, since I find this least
    disturbing both for the texture on the page and for the reading process. \r\n\r\nWhen
    I use 'align to baseline grid' for the text in InDesign, I usually like to give
    uneaven space above and below subheadings (that appear in the middle of a column).
    The way I do this is to assign the subheading the amount of space above and below
    that will give it a blank line above and below. Then, to pull it a little closer
    to 'it's' paragraph (the one below) I give it a 'baseline shift' in the minus/negative
    range.\r\n\r\nDon't know if this is a frowned upon way to do it, but it has worked
    so far. The problem is when the subheading appears on the top of a column/page,
    since it (the subheading) then won't align right with the top of the other columns."

  body: "I generally use an indent for any paragraph after the first, unless it follows
    a head. When I do add space btw paragraphs (no indent then) I do it using Space
    Before, not Space After. I was taught this by a former typesetter. If you add
    the space before, it's attached to the paragraph itself not the preceding paragraph
    which means you can have a separate style sheet for the first paragraph with no
    space before, and also it won't affect any heads or following typographic elements.
    I hope this is clear.\r\n\r\nAlways build the space (whether before or after)
    into the style sheet itself even if it's a full line space. Good typography is
    about MINIMIZING superfluous characters, such as an extra return (which will come
    back to haunt you, say, at the top of a column). This is also why a paragraph
    indent should be in the style sheet itself rather than a tab character."
