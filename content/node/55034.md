    way to do it: \r\nProcess both images separately in Shop: convert to cmyk, draw
    outline paths, save these, save image as psd.\r\nUse star-brush to make borderdesign.
    Save as b&w tiff.\r\nDraw map in Illustrator, using spotcolours or grays. Save
    as ai.\r\nIn ID or QXP define page. Import psd\u2019s and ai\u2019s in layout.
    Define colours(s) for background, lettering etc. Import tiff, recolour to spot.
    Place texts and apply effects to them (either in layout program or go back to
    Illustrator).\r\nFiddle around until satisfied.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: "I'm not sure whether you are asking how to make a clipping path or how to
    run four colour separations for print.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that you can run
    colour separations by placing your clipping paths in Indesign and in the 'colour'
    section of print options select separations in the drop down menu. It should be
    as simple as that.\r\n\r\nYour printer should be able to run 4 colour process
    from a CMYK Photoshop file (although he will hate you for sending Photoshop files).
    They will run the separations for making plates in-house, so you shouldn't be
    worried about it unless you happen to have a four colour litho machine (in which
    case I would recommend you hire someone who knows how to work it!)"
