    your system around those.\r\nIt might not be as user-friendly as if you stick
    with the obvious choices, but you will learn more.\r\nAnd perhaps pedestrians
    would rather read all-cap serifed local type than a generic u&lc sans serif that
    would be like anywhere in the world."

    can make a whole signage system using Bodoni and if you are talented, it will
    work. Now if you are not that talented, you can always count on good friends such
    as Frutiger, Clearview, Interstate, DIN, Helvetica, Myriad, and blah blah blah.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: 'Wayfinding in itself is a broad topic. As Nick and David pointed out, legibility
    isn''t aways the most important factor. In the case of say, automobile signage,
    there may be genuine safety considerations that trump everything else. Otherwise
    I think one needs to look at what is appropriate in the given context. For example,
    some park signage in Portland, where I live, uses Gill Sans. I''ve always thought
    it made the park a bit classier. '

  body: "First establish how far away people will read the signs, and how big you
    want the text to be at that distance. This should take into consideration the
    possible viewers, and how good their eyesight is. Per Mollerup recommends, as
    a rule of thumb, calculating the reading distance as the x-height multiplied by
    500. For instance, a one centimetre x-height would be readable 5 metres away.(He
    also says in health care environments this should go down to a factor of 400 or
    300.) \r\nThink about how dense you want the information to be vertically (ie
    linespacing), as this will suggest different typefaces with different proportions.
    Vectora, with a huge x-height and tiny caps, could be set relatively tightly.
    This in turn will start to suggest the size of a \"module\" - a single unit of
    information - that can be repeated in multiples to build up a signface.\r\nAlso,
    make sure that for whatever typeface you pick you can find an arrow that is formally
    sympathetic."

  body: "there are many variables.\r\n\r\n(um, duh... yeah.)\r\n\r\neconomy of lateral
    space is an important one in signage. You might find that designing to a worst
    case scenario (a long place name, for example) that you can set a narrower typeface
    with a larger cap height than a wider face, so the narrower typeface will effectively
    be the more legible one in that circumstance. Where height is the limiting factor
    (not often with signage, I find) then a wider typeface will be more legible. \r\n\r\n\r\nClearviewHWY
    is great, but it is wide, and has wide tracking. Where I have seen it in use,
    it often seems to be set somewhat on the tight side because of limited space,
    which defeats the purpose in using it. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
