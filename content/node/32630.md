  body: My appologies, it seems as if I asked a question that I apeared to have answered,
    it's been a long 2 days. The question I should have asked was if there was a way
    to adjust the baseline grid using InDesign? thanks.

  body: Oh that seemed to work. I do have one more question. I have my baseline grid
    set to increment every 0.125 in (9 points, same as my leading) How would I get
    my rows to rest on the baseline the rows are 0.0686 in, that is half of the baseline
    grid.
