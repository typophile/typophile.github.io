		<div class="commentbody">Dwiggins was a great admirer of Cheltenham (having selected it for his subject when asked by the Eastern Paper Company to create a broadsheet specimen of his choice for them).

At one point, he toyed with his own design inspired by and based on some of the Cheltenham proportions and characteristics. In the end it came to nothing.

During the course of this short-lived experiment, C.H. Griffith sent to WAD a package with this note: "For such interest as it may have, I am enclosing a photostat reproduction of the original Goodhue drawings of Cheltenham. These drawings were subsequently modified by Morris Benton, resulting in the present Cheltenham Old Style letter. Benton's drawings were used for our cutting."

To this Dwiggins replied: "The Goodhue drawing most interesting -- shows that he was a better architect than he was type-designer."

-- Kent.

Of course ATF and Linotype could have been cross licensing from each other, it’s not like anybody kept records of that stuff…</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick -- I'm not sure why you're referring to Benton's cleaned up and regularized Cheltenham as a "slab serif," or even a "toned-down" slab (as James qualified it). The original ATF Cheltenham shows, for the most part, rather thick, stubby, and heavily bracketed serifs. Not quite as filled-in on the hard stock of the 1923 catalog as the somewhat fuzzy reproduction that Mark posted, but still, not what I would call slab. </div>

It's a low-contrast face with thick serifs, so that's what makes it a slab, IMO. The roundedness of the brackets is so slight at text size, given the stubbiness of the serifs, as to not be much of a feature. However, the novel "s" shape of the bracket is quite distinctive at display size.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, Nick. I suppose it's a matter of semantics. I consider the Cheltenham serifs more of a Clarendon structure -- bracketed, low-constrast, squarish ending. I suppose some consider Clarendon a slab-serif. But for me it doesn't become slab until there's no bracketing.

I'm not contesting the essence of your point; clearly Benton shifted the design toward a low-contrast finish even while trying to maintain Goodhue's underlying letterforms.

I think it's a little misleading, though, to compare the later Cheltenham family additions as the Benton characteristics became more pronounced as the family developed, especially in heavier wider styles. 

I think the original Oldstyle actually retains a fair amount of Goodhue's quaintness.
