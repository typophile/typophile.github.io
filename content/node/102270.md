  models within the same design? I\u2019m thinking of something like the attached
  image. Albeit, there\u2019s a lot of strange stuff going on here, but the part I\u2019m
  interested in discussing is the how the branch grow out of the stem in r/a vs. n-based
  shapes. The \u2018r\u2019 would need to be treated different from \u2018n\u2019
  in any typeface, so I\u2019m thinking: why not find its echo somewhere else than
  in \u2018n\u2019 altogether?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mixing_4928.png]\r\n\r\nApologies
  for the poor English. (And the poor design too. I\u2019m in the process of learning
  how to draw serifs.)"

    work?"

    It seems to blend the two well.

  body: "Look for example at H&FJ's [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017|Mercury]],
    which shows more than two different terminal styles. I certainly think there's
    nothing wrong with it, it is principally a matter of getting the contrast right
    and keeping consistency afloat. Getting the contrast right is more difficult when
    working on semi serifs (a successful example is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alcuin/|Alcuin]]).
    As far as the mixing of styles goes, the task really boils down to mixing them
    consistently <em>enough</em>. Mixing styles will get in the way of achieving consistency,
    that's for sure.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon the same problem when working on my last
    typeface [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alexis-luengas/meleo/|Meleo]]. What I
    learned from it is that if you're going to bring two different terminal styles
    together, you better make those styles <em>clearly different</em>."

  body: "I think you'll have trouble finding <em>successful</em> such designs because
    it's a very PoMo approach, and PoMo type has yet to mature. But there is zero
    reason this sort of thing can't work; historical faithfulness can be a crutch
    as much as it can be a shortcut to specific shape-solutions (and it's rarely much
    more than the latter). But of course breaking from precedent is more work, not
    least in terms of ensuring readability.\r\n\r\nSo even if something hasn't been
    done successfully in the past, it's still true that all you need is a reason to
    make it now. And lacking any evidence that it's actually functionally harmful,
    this reason could actually be as simple as: \"I like the way it looks.\" And remember,
    unlike display fonts, text fonts work \"under the radar\", so much stranger stuff
    can make sense.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe visual discord between the arches and the
    \"r\" in your first example could actually work; but I think it's better if the
    \"r\" isn't all alone (which BTW is the main reason I prefer the open-bottom binocular
    \"g\" - it can accompany the \"s\"). Your second \"n\" is very nice, and promising.
    End of story. :-)  However if you do want a precedent of how \"wild\" things can
    get, look at Fleischmann, especially his #65 (which people have yet to develop
    the cojones to properly revive).\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttp://www.typographer.org/2005_06_01_digests.html

  body: "Thanks. I\u2019ve read Yves\u2019 review multiple times before (it mentions
    Mercury, if I remember correctly). I also have a ragged old 1800-something edition
    of <em>De Mensch</em> typeset one of  Fleischmann\u2019s types. I\u2019m not sure
    if I find it very relevant to this experiment though. \r\n\r\n<em>What I learned
    from it is that if you're going to bring two different terminal styles together,
    you better make those styles clearly different.</em>\r\nIt\u2019s not so much
    about the terminals, but that\u2019s still relevant.\r\n\r\n<em>The visual discord

    branch structures are repeated multiple times through-out the alphabet. There\u2019s
    a little bit of both \u2018r\u2019 and \u2018n\u2019 in \u2018g\u2019, for example,
    but not the spoon-fed kind. I suspect I might have too many ingredients though,
    with the Dwiggins-esque flips.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_4969.png]\r\n\r\n"

    discussed the concept there."
