  it conventional to use a straight apostrophe, or a single curly/typographer's quote,
  and which direction should it be in?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "An apostrophe is always oriented the same way as a comma.\r\n\r\nWhile it
    did turn out right in this case, you can't always depend on automatic correction
    (such as in this forum, or in Word) to get these things right, because there's
    no way for the software to tell whether something is supposed to be a single quote
    or an apostrophe."

  body: "Have to be careful with this question as modern convention could be said
    to be one way because this is so often seen done incorrectly these days! :-(\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    quotes are like 6s and 9s right? An apostrophe should <strong>always</strong>
    be a 9 if the font contains it.\r\n\r\nThe \u201Cstraight apostrophe\u201D is
    a foot mark.\r\n"
