    target="_blank">Franklin Gothic Demi Oblique</a> artificially extended?

  body: The numbers are not Franklin Gothic - they look more like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/"
    target="_blank">Helvetica</a>. But the logo is definitely not Helvetica.

  body: I think it&#39;s just <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/arial/bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=IMPORTADRENALIN&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Arial Bold Italic</a>, obliqued even more and artificially stretched.
    The whole site is littered with Arial also. <BR> <BR>AP1 is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/arial/italic/testdrive.html?s=AP1&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Arial Italic</a> and S2000 is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/arial/black-italic/testdrive.html?s=S2000&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Arial Black Italic</a>.

  body: The cap R in Adrenelin doesn&#39;t match Arial. <BR>You&#39;re right about
    the AP1 and S2000 though.

  body: are you sure, patricia? i think the small curve of the R leg might just have
    disappeared with all the obliquing and stretching that was going on combined with
    the low resolution. &#40;this is definitely stretched -- look at the uneven weight
    distribution on the T, for instance&#41;

  body: No, I&#39;m not sure. But I don&#39;t see the curve. It is definitely stretched.
    <BR> <BR>I wish they had spelled adrenalin correctly...
