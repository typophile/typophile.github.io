  I am thinking of Futura. We were given a picture in class and had to write a short
  story about it. Then translate it into a typographic poster. No restrictions in
  regards to that. The picture had to do with robots and felt very futuristic. '

  body: I'm always baffled designers still stick to the 'oh it's new and different'
    fonts of the 60's, or in the style of them for sci-fi.. Since well, it's the ultimate
    future-type & tech achievement to create perfectly balanced display versions of
    classical serifs instead of plain straight & square grotesques. Ah well, I guess
    everyone goes for the dystopian touch.

  body: 'A good point Oranginas but I guess, as with most things, the poster is aimed
    at the hard-working salt of the earth  sort and not typographic and semiotics
    conscious creatives like ourselves. So in order to look Futuristic the Type must
    be "Futuristic" and what is obviously futuristic to everybody else...something
    like OCR-A, Adobe mono, Mars Police or Crouwel''s New Alphabet, any typeface designed
    with computer recognition in mind normally looks suitably Science Fiction-esque. '

  body: don-flash, I think if the designer can come up with something that is not
    the conventional 60s-80s sci-fi computer type, and still convey the future, designers
    and "salt of the earth" types alike would be able to understand and appreciate
    it, even if they don't know why they do. That said I don't see why you can't use
    something obviously "futuristic". To me there can be beauty in kitsch.

  body: "I think futuristic posters can be done with any typeface, it's just the usage
    that matters. It's probably more down to 'unknown'  or 'different'  since examples
    like the new alphabet and OCR-A are horribly outdated, and the tech that required
    the letterforms the way they are doesn't even exist any more.\r\n\r\nIt's not
    really as a comment, (and I don't want to hijack your thread !) but I find it
    quite interesting since, well how new are those forms ? One of my lecturers for
    type design had once shown examples of old foundry type with almost the same abstraction,
    as what the OCR and New Alphabet had (although they were of course, designed that
    way for different reasons) So such shapes have always been around in minds, although
    less in use.\r\n\r\nThis all aside, it's always a safe bet to go for futuristic
    type, cliches are there to use and play around with. And with at least one solid
    'this is the future' primer in your design, you can play around more with the
    other aspects of the poster, making them less strict future-like."

  body: ">I think futuristic posters can be done with any typeface\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
    seems to be an interesting topic. I believe two opposing forces might exist if
    you want to make something to convey two kinds of future. The opposition should
    stand between humanist and non-humanist types. Why is that? It has to do with
    the two generally conveyed futures of utopia and dystopia. Or, to explain better,
    of anarchy and autocracy.\r\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, essencially, in autocratic
    governments it's more regular to see rigid and geometrically conceived typefaces,
    as well as architecture. Or at least it is that way conceived.\r\nMore calligraphic
    or humanist types are related to decadent periods (symbolic decadence), when a
    more broader knowledge has been acquired about a subject, period which is bound
    to cease it's existence.\r\nI don't know if I'm fully explaining myself, but a
    historical overview might turn some light on this subject.\r\n\r\nAncient Rome
    was definitely an autocratic government. And although typographical records for
    this period lacked rules, it's renaissance counterpart did, and renaissance was
    a period used by the catholic church to dignify itself.\r\nMore callygraphic records
    from the mannerist and pre-mannerist periods, derived from carolingian type, are
    more closely related to utopias, and to 'Utopia', by Thomas Moore.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again, the Neoclassical/Romantic period were widely used to promote politics and
    governents, and didones are due to this time. But realist and expressionist types
    are very much more calligraphic, or perhaps less refined.\r\n\r\nHitlerian domination
    were recurrent with their very structural blackletter opposed for a time humanist
    (more concretely roman) typefaces, when art deco thrived.\r\n\r\nAnd struturalism,
    gestalt and bauhaus promoted a neutral, or geometric type, for international use,
    without personality, much to the likings of '1974'.\r\n\r\nIn the days we live,
    affected by today's general crisis, we once again prefer humanist types and faces,
    full of their own inconsistencies that themselves make type beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt
    therefore seems natural when imperial future calls for it, to use types related
    in closeness to those of the sixties, due to the prevalence of sans in light-bound
    systems (computers and monitors) against serifs in print, and geometrical sorts
    that we all relate to 'future'.\r\nA big problem with typography, as well as with
    every other arts, is that we usually apply our own time set ideals to different
    times and eras, which might easily find them obsolete or erroneous. Citing Robert
    Bringhurst in my own words (and I don't particularly fully agree with this specific
    point of view, but it seems to apply for this), type doesn't evolve, it changes
    throughout time."
