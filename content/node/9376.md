body: Hi, I&#39;m new to this board and this is my first post.. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working
  on designing a cover for an upcoming title on Ray Charles and the publisher is insisting
  that the title &#34;use the same typeface that was used in the Ray movie promos&#34;
  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.raymovie.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.raymovie.com/index.php</a>
  <BR> <BR>From what I can tell it looks like &#34;Ray&#34; was hand-drawn, no? Does
  anyone have any suggestions?

  body: Is it from Ray Charles&#39; signature? It&#39;s not a perfect match with this,
    but there are some similarities &#40;especially with the R&#41;. People&#39;s
    signatures change over time. <BR> <BR><a href="http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=29870&amp;item=3875562666&amp;rd=1"

  body: It probably is hand-drawn &#40;whether it&#39;s really Ray Charles&#39; handwriting
    is another question&#41;, but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rage-italic/rage-italic/testdrive.html?s=Ray&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Rage Italic</a> produces a good simulation of it, I think.
