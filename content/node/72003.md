  I don't actually get any error in the Terminal window it's just nothing actually

  body: 'Theunis - I''m not exactly sure what I did different, I just started fresh
    earlier today and it worked. I''m not a big Terminal fan as it''s a bit too tech
    for me and kind of makes me nervous. If you miss a space or make the slightest
    mistake it''s hard to tell as it''s like a foreign language I assume unless your
    a developer. Most likely I made a small error translating the instructions in
    my haste which led to the initial problem of the Macros not installing, but now
    it all looks good and I''m excited to try out the Adobe autohint feature, among
    others. : )'
