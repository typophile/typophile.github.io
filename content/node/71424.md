body: "HI all,\r\n\r\nI could really use some advice, as I'm driving myself nuts worrying
  about this. So any input would be very, very much appreciated :) \r\n\r\nLong story
  short - I was working on a large design job for a publication over the last year.
  During the project I tried out several different typefaces, and finally the client
  and I settled on the DIN Condensed family. \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure where I
  got the fonts from in the first place, but I was using them. I then planned to purchase
  the font license before the project went to print. i.e. I'm trying to be completely
  legit.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, now that all of the work is done I can't actually
  find where I can purchase EXACT version of DIN Condensed that I've been using. \r\n\r\nI
  didn't realise there would be any difference between versions, so I went ahead and
  bought FF DIN Condensed OT. I then removed the version I had been using, but found
  that inDesign didn't recognise it as the same font!\r\n\r\nThe original font files
  had names like 'FF DINCond-Bold' and 'FF DINCond-Medium'.\r\n\r\nThe new ones that
  I've purchased have names like 'DINOT-Cond.otf' etc...\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Does
  anybody know where I can purchase those fonts? And do I even need to seeing as I
  have a license...?</li>\r\n<li>I find it quite confusing, as there seems to be dozens
  of versions of DIN alone... How can you tell exactly which version a font is before
  you buy? \r\n<li>I've since found versions of all of the DIN Condensed fonts available
  for download on the free fonts website [name removed by moderator] - does this mean
  I didn't need to purchase the fonts at all? i.e. they are public domain, as the
  website says...</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nApologies for all the questions. I could just really
  use some advice (worrying myself sick that I've screwed up! \r\nThanks a million.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDee\r\n\r\nP.s.
  by all means tell me if I'm worrying about nothing!\r\n"

  body: "Dee, sounds like the fonts you originally used were Postscript versions,
    and you purchased Opentype versions. They should be essentially the same, and
    you would merely go to \"Find Font\" in InDesign and replace the Postscript version
    with the Opentype versions.\r\n\r\nThe website you mentioned is illegally posting
    fonts. I checked it out, and they are hosting and allowing free downloads of fonts
    that are owned by major type foundries. They may have some public domain fonts
    on there, but I would steer clear of that site."

  body: "HI Chris,\r\n\r\nThanks - I really appreciate the input.\r\n\r\nYeah I think
    you might  be right that the original font was a Postscript version. The problem
    is the project has already gone to print, and I want to make sure I have a valid
    license for the finished product. \r\n\r\nAlso, the product is a textbook, and
    it includes a CDROM-based PDF of additional content, which also uses the same
    fonts as the print. So I worry that it is 'out there' but not properly licensed.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think I still need to purchase the Postcript version to be fully covered?
    Or would my Opentype license cover me...?\r\n\r\nI'm not thrilled at the additional
    expense, but I'd rather be on the level. The only thing is I can't seem to find
    the Postscript version anywhere, and even when I think I've found it I'm never
    100% it's the right one - I don't fancy spending another $300 only to find out
    it's a slightly different version ;)\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nDee"

  body: Hi Dee, it would be best to speak directly to FontShop - the foundry that
    released FF DIN. Stephen Coles is around Typophile quite a bit, you might be able
    to track him down. Good luck.

  body: "Hi Chris,\r\n\r\nSounds like a good idea. I think I'll just give FontShop
    a call. I'm a tiny bit worried that they'll be unimpressed that I managed to get
    hold of the fonts in the first place - I genuinely don't know where I got them.
    Probably picked them up in design college..\r\n\r\nHopefully they'll understand
    the situation.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your advice\r\nDee"

  body: Yes, give FontShop a call. Getting properly licensed is the best thing you
    can do. And they'd love to know who might be illegally distributing the fonts
    as well.

  body: "Thanks Stephen.\r\n\r\nTruth is I'm not really sure where I got them. I've
    seen DIN online on free font sites, so for a long time I just assumed it was a
    free font. It wasn't until I looked into it that I realised otherwise.\r\n\r\nDo
    you know if my DIN OT license covers the Postscript version?\r\n\r\nDee"
