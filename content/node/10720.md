  body: the silver fern and the colour black &#40;as in all the sports teams ..all
    blacks, black caps,black socks....&#41; the colours teal, green &amp; blue. the
    koru, the err kiwi, these we see everywhere, and seem to be the default icons
    when designing a logo for anything new zealand.  <BR>You could try looking at
    the native plants and birds &#40;other than the kiwi&#41; as these have many distinctive
    aspects to them. <BR>maps of the world with new zealand in the centre. <BR>as
    for a new zealand typeface, I will have to think.
