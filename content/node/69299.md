  great on offset print.\r\nBut i'm not very sure about how it will look on screen

    the "ink-trap" elements to pretty much disappear below 16 point or so. And silk-screening
    for stationery? Not recommended if the stationery will be going through a laser
    printer...'

    from Font Bureau. So you might as well contact them and see if they\u2019ve already
    done studies into screen use of Amplitude or have screen versions for licensing."
