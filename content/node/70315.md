body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI'm getting in a bit of a muddle with my old style figures, and
  wonder if somebody can clear this up for me?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm setting a long
  text in Caslon Pro, using the Opentype version with its Opentype old style figures
  throughout the text. I noticed that words and acronyms involving both numbers and
  letters looked very odd, so I decided that I probably should be using Opentype small
  caps for acronyms. Is that the typographically correct approach? If so...\r\n\r\n-
  What do I do with acronyms in italics (e.g. a magazine whose name is an acronym)?
  There are no italic small caps in the font that I can see, so do I just create an
  inconsistency, or should I fake it using Indesign's Small Caps (not the Opentype
  small caps)?\r\n- Are there some clear rules on when and when not to use small caps,
  for example, I'm unsure about the X in X-rated?\r\n\r\nOr should I simply revert
  to non-old style numbers?\r\n\r\nThanks very much\r\nMichael"

  body: "Your question was also a big trouble to me.\r\n\r\nProper small caps usage
    demand a set of small caps figures. Some recent fonts already have this (Greta
    Pro, Comenia Pro, etc.). Lining figures are almost unusable with small caps a-z
    and the old style ones seem odd, somewhat misaligned. Anyway, if you don't have
    small caps figures, the old style is preferable. \r\n\r\nProper small caps also
    demand complete style/weight variation. I never understood these fonts with SC
    in regular styles and without SC in italics. This makes no sense.\r\n\r\nI think
    the ideal solution is to have SC a bit higher than x-height, including figures
    and punctuation, and petite caps set exactly at the x-height. Vesper Pro adopts
    this. So you can handle mixed acronyms (like PostgreSQL) and have numbers perfeclty
    fitting the small caps height.\r\n\r\nI manage mostly technical and legal texts
    with lots of acronyms and numbers. The sub optimal result I get with SC and oldstyle
    figures in almost all fonts was the main reason I decided to develop my own font.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if there is an alternative to Caslon Pro with complete SC features. Maybe
    the beautyful Calluna."

  body: "Common practice is to use full caps for three capitals in a row or fewer,
    and small caps for four or more and A.M. and P.M. You can use small caps for educational
    degrees too, as long as you use periods.\r\n\r\nIf you decide, just because you
    have so many of them, that your own style should put three-letter acronyms in
    small caps, that will probably fly, but not two letters or one. So no, not for
    X-rated.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if you absolutely need to fake italic small caps,
    it's better to slant real small caps than to fake small caps with real italics."

  body: "I\u2019d consider Adobe Caslon Pro a book face but also a workhorse, so the
    lacking Italic Small Caps is a bit unexpected even though you rarely need them
    in book work. More complex work could definitely use both Italic SC and Petite
    Caps.\r\n\r\nI had to fake some small caps (just a couple of words) in a recent
    project. I decide to scale down the italic capitals, added a thin stroke to the
    shapes to match the weight and also nudged them ever so slightly up from the baseline
    (the same distance as the added stroke). I also streched them by about 110% and
    added a bit of tracking.\r\n\r\nWhich way to go depends how much the italics differ
    from the roman and on the size you are using.\r\n\r\nIMO, speaking as a graphic
    designer, if you have two sets of SC the smallest should be slightly taller than
    the x-height and the largest just below the capitals (useful in capital heavy
    languages like German, and for genetive case with names in all caps). That\u2019s
    up to the type designer, anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fonts.\r\nSorry, no Nick's Caslon.\r\n\r\nIMHO it is the \"best practice\" to
    have oldstyle figures as the default for the Small Caps feature, and small-cap-height
    lining figures as the default for the All Small Caps (c2sc) feature."

  body: "Thanks for your interesting replies.\r\nIn the end I chickened out and ditched
    the old style figures completely - a decision made reluctantly but I couldn't
    quite bring myself to fake it on the italics and others potentially updating the
    file in years to come won't necessarily understand what's been done and where.
    I'll definitely look out for italic small caps in future, but this particular
    project was too far down the line for a change of typeface.\r\nOut of interest,
    what's the distinction between small caps and petite caps (@freiberger)? @frode
    frank you also mentioned having two sets of small caps, what are they exactly?\r\nThanks!"
