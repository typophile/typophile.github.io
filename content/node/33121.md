body: "Hi all;\r\n\r\nI need to make a really elegant door sign that says 'OFFICE'
  - this is for a client who's identity elegantly straddles classic/modern.\r\n\r\nhere's
  my criteria:\r\n\r\n\u2022 evocative of vintage without looking kitchy (perhaps
  a modern typeface with classic undertones?)\r\n\r\n\u2022 or if it *is* kitchy,
  (ie some sort of extreme wood-type) then I'd like it to feel intentionally over
  the top - if that makes sense.\r\n\r\n\u2022 readable from a distance - can be serif/sanserif,
  but not too thin\r\n\r\n\u2022 all caps if possible\r\n\r\nI'm open to anything
  interesting -- for some reason I can't stretch my brain on this. I keep coming up
  with Engravers Roman, and I know there are a zillion other ideas. \r\n\r\nThanks
  so much."

    working here. Not sure what that would be, though.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course,
    totally wrong given the criteria, but fun to think about."
