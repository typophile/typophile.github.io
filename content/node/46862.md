  Curves]]? Here's a [[http://typographica.org/001156.php|review over at Typographica.org]]\r\n\r\nI
  have one of his books and it is amazing. This one I might have to save a bit for
  it at $100 plus shipping!"

  body: 'It is incredible. I own all of his books and find them very useful, esp Fonts
    and Logos although all of them are great. I really like Dangerous Curves because
    it is pretty much all sketches of his custom logo work. I love seeing his process
    and his sketches, his work is amazing. He attends the Y Conference down here in
    San Diego fairly frequently, if you can make it out he is a fascinating person
    to speak with and will even sign your book. '

    in NYC at the Harvard Club a few weeks ago and it was a wonderful evening. I feel
    honored that Doyald asked me to contribute an essay to the book.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: Doyald is going to be a featured speaker at TypeCon this year, and I can't
    wait to hear his talk. He'll also do a book signing for Dangerous Curves - I already
    have my signed copy reserved.
