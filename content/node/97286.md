  making custom volumes (holds) for climbing gyms. The idea here is that all of his
  products are made from triangles, so all of the typography is derived from a 30,60,90
  triangle.The name of the company is Irujo.\r\n\r\nI am trying to put together a
  solid logo for him to use and I would love to hear some feedback from everyone.
  Feel free to critique color palette, typographic form, and readability.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  The logo needs to work printed and as a stencil to spray paint onto the products.\r\n\r\n"

    try really hard to figure it out, I read <em>Xrvjo</em>. Maybe you could try another
    solution besides making all your letterforms out of triangles.\r\n\r\nIf you are
    going to spray-paint the logo onto the product with a stencil, you'll have a hard
    time replicating the gradient fill. You'll get better results silk-screening the
    logo onto the product. You can order printed labels, too, but be sure to ask for
    ones that use inks, substrates, and adhesives designed for outdoor use."

    like this the key is to resist the temptation to make it totally literal, otherwise
    the results typically end up totally gimmicky. Either use actual triangles very
    sparingly, or merely allude to triangles. Subtlety is key. You might even go for
    -or start from- something as subtle as this:\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/primary/bold\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    your work. Believe me.\r\nI also agree with both previous comments. This logo
    doesn't work. It's unreadable, unprofessional, unmemorable. It's too gimmicky.
    And Custom volume doesn't complement other shapes either."
