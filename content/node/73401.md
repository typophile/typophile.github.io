body: "Hello Everybody,\r\n\r\nI noticed my typeface (Expletus Sans) doesn't look
  as it should on screen and discovered about hinting. I used the 'autohinting' function
  in TypeTool, which seemd to work fine in the glyph window. As I used the (hinted)
  typeface in inDesign and made a pdf from it, I discovered it still looked bad. You
  can download the pdf here: http://www.typophile.com/node/72368\r\n\r\nI generated
  it as an opentype ps, in case that makes a difference. Does hinting just not solve
  the problem or am I doing something wrong? Any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard"

    Acrobat does a less-than-stellar job of rendering at odd percentages.\r\n\r\nIf
    the problem's still there, do a forum search for \"hinting\": there are LOTS of
