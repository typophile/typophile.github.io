  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all you amazing type designers. I've recently tried my hand at developing a face of my own (you can find it in the serif section of the critique board) and am wondering what to do with it. I've considered releasing it under a creative commons <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0<!-- raw HTML omitted --> license. I've seen some really incredible free fonts (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->apostrophic lab fonts, for example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) made available for personal use, faces that are far more complete and attractive than my own experiment. My question is, basically, is this a good idea? Does making fonts available for free, no matter the quality, effect those who make their living creating and selling fonts? Does the availability of free fonts reduce the perceived value of commercial ones, or can free and commercial fonts co-exist?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">This is a question I have thought about a lot, in part because most of the typefaces I develop are either freely available for non-commercial use (e.g. the Society of Biblical Literature fonts) or are bundled with other software (e.g. fonts I've made for Microsoft) which, however incorrectly, does give many users the impression that the fonts are somehow free. My take on this kind of thing is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not going to work for free,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but this is a different matter from fonts themselves being free. As long as someone pays for the development at an appropriate rate, I have no objection to the fonts themselves being free. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think it is avoidable that 'the availability of free fonts reduces the perceived value of commercial ones' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for some users.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is true whether the free fonts are on a freeware download site or show up on the user's computer with some software. The idea that because one thing is free that everything in the same broad class should be free is simply illogic. Some of this impact can be countered with education. I think companies that bundle fonts with software, as one instance, could do more to educate users about where the fonts come from and their value &ndash; and things are improving a bit in this regard &ndash; but there will always be some people who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prefer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to think of fonts as valueless and free for the taking because it makes them feel less guilty about stealing them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your precise question &ndash; 'Does making fonts available for free, no matter the quality, effect those who make their living creating and selling fonts?' &ndash; deserves a precise answer: the impact of free fonts matters most <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when they look like commercial fonts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If someone wants to make original designs available as free fonts, who am I to say he shouldn't? If that person wants to public'ly argue that all fonts should be free, I'll have words to say on the subject, but what he does with his own work is his business &ndash; this, to me, is the central tenet of respect for intellectual property &ndash;, and if that includes giving away free fonts, the kind of inevitable devaluation due to stupidity or willfulness is something I need to find constructive ways to counter, through education. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[By the way, Fred Nader of Apostrophic Labs is not well liked by many professional type designers. His activities in the area of free font distribution are not limited to his own fonts or those of his willing collaborators. A few years ago he was sued by a number of commercial foundries for posting their fonts to a Usenet binaries group. So you might want to pick some other example of free font philanthropy.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, thank you for such a well thought out response, you've helped me clarify my own thinking.  The availability of professional quality fonts for free is rare, most lack a full character set, range of weights, or other options that a professional would desire. For personal use this isn't as important. People who make their livings working with fonts buy fonts, Joe six pack does not. That there are a few fonts of extreme quality available to Joe for naught is great, as everyone should experience the joy of typography. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with your points regarding the re-distribution of bundled fonts, education is necessary (but I personally feel that most license are too restrictive. While I respect and generally adhere to a products license, my personal opinion is that if a product is for a professional market than the use of that product by individuals who would have no professional interest in it is not going to hurt anyone's bottom line. But whatever). Releasing one's own creations into the public domain should not hurt the perceived value of commercial work. I was not aware of Fred Nader's reputation, having stumbled across his site via Luc Devroye's link pages, regardless, some of the fonts he or his friends created are quite good, as are many of the fonts released by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dieter Steffmann<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (whom I assume has a better reputation?). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and if that includes giving away free fonts, the kind of inevitable devaluation due to stupidity or willfulness is something I need to find constructive ways to counter, through education.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> While I agree that the public at large is poorly informed when it comes to intellectual property and its value or lack there of as well as to the ethical considerations involved in infringement, I'm not certain that is the issue I meant to address. I was thinking more of how, in the graphic design community, for example, things like competitive bidding, logo and other design contests, etc. have tended to reduce the value &ndash; in terms of what a professional is willing to pay &ndash; of these services. My concern is that, given the difficulty of tracking the use of a font once it is released into the wild, it could easily be used (intentionally or through carelessness) in a commercial application without the designer ever becoming aware of it. Those who should, by the very nature of the application they intend for the font, be providing remuneration, are the focus of my question.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Generally, this is true. The advent of digital technologies has upset old relationships, though. The ease of copying, the fidelity of copies, the speed of exchange: these are all contributing to a devaluation of original creations. When type consisted of trays of metal, there was little doubt to its value as a manufactured item. Type that exists only in the ethereal matter of software is already of diminished perceived value, because it can be copied, multiplied and exchanged so easily. So the impact of free font distribution on the perception of value must be reckoned in addition to an overall reduction in real value (manufacturing costs, wholesale and retail pricing, increased competition, etc.).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->'Does making fonts available for free, no matter the quality, effect those who make their living creating and selling fonts?' <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interestingly enough, this same question can be put to a number of diverse services offered throughout the design community. In effect, we have to ask ourselves if doing work for free is harmful to the design profession (and the consumer)? Overall, I would say &quot;yes, it is&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In some rare cases, I think it is useful to offer free fonts (free design) for promotion or where a guarantee can be made that future projects and payment will follow. However, I think that for the most part, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free equals cheap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and most consumers who are downloading free fonts (or getting free design) don't have the same respect for the work as they would if they had to pay for it. I know that I don't. I am always suspicious of &quot;free&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a member of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada, I truly believe that designers (of any kind) have a professional duty to educate people and promote the respect of design everywhere. (This might sound elitist, but someone has to take the lead on this). If you are at all curious about the Code of Ethics, you can find it herer: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.gdc.net/for_business/ethics.php?id=1&amp;amp;press=1&amp;amp;draw_column=3:1:2">http://www.gdc.net/for_business/ethics.php?id=1&amp;amp;press=1&amp;amp;draw_column=3:1:2</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and download it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sure, I know that I cannot stop Joe down the block from creating free logos, or worse, selling them for $99 a pop. And if designers want to continue in that vein, as John writes, who am I to stop them? However, I cannot help but feel that giving away or undervaluing design undercuts our professionalism and devalues all our work and when I try to justify charging as much as I do, I have to ensure that the consumer/client understands that &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also have an issue with the &quot;no matter the quality&quot; bit.</div>

Back in the late nineties I started a free font website, and that led to me setting up a commercial operation.

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can understand that you were hamming it up a bit for comic effect, but I think the reason that you got a response was that the idea that money = motivation hits a raw nerve with people who are motivated by non-material rewards. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You also threw in the idea that socialism removes motivation, while capitalism promotes motivation. This is really a tired old argument which has been discredited on many lavels by a whole range of people, and a large variety of arguments. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For example, it has been pointed out that under capitalism, those who work hardest (think of factory workers, nurses, miners, carers etc) are generally very poorly rewarded, while those who are very highly rewarded (owners of factories, mines etc), often do very little work at all. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this light we might ask about the motivational strengths of capitalism. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You also state that 'Most humans are motivated on some level by a basic self-interest'. Well, on some level, yes, but why do so many people become nurses etc. The qualification is tough, the hours are long, the pay is poor - the self-interest is in the non-monetary rewards of the vocation. For most people involved in creative work, the non-monetary rewards provide the motivation.</div>

<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you for your insight. I was not surprised by the response - I kinda assumed my post would raise a hackle or two, but I did not mean to irritate anyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To address a couple of your comments: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You said, &quot;You also threw in the idea that socialism removes motivation, while capitalism promotes motivation. This is really a tired old argument which has been discredited on many lavels by a whole range of people, and a large variety of arguments.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tired old argument? Discredited? I would say that you are making too general a statement (something I am guilty of in my first post!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you had stated that experts the world over do not agree on which system best motivates, I would take no exception. But to claim that my stance has been discredited is a stretch. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, you are confusing self-interest with selfishness or self-centeredness. I would argue that your nurse IS doing what he does out of self-interest. He may have some need to help others - it makes him feel better about himself and the world he lives in. So, he becomes a nurse and thus addresses his own interests while at the same time on the surface addresses the needs of those around him. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't forget, too, that not everyone has the mind to become an attorney or PhD. these people end up having fewer options in life (or at least perceived options) and some become your factory workers and miners. Please do not turn my comments around and think that I am saying every laborer is simple minded. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your comment about the higher-level people in a capitalistic society is flawed, too. Owners of businesses work very hard - harder and longer and with much more at stake than the workers that populate their payroll. To think otherwise is simplistic and parochial. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK - now that I have cornered myself, have barred my teeth and am hissing, please do not take my comments personally or as an attack. You are welcome to think whatever you want about economics, politics and the psychology of man - it is all too complex for anyone to claim full understanding. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*</li>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think free fonts are a bad thing. It's a digital distribution/commerce era we're entering, so, like music, I think the models of distribution and promotion will have to incorporate new and different methods/ideas. And, really, samples won't change the minds of those who will and won't buy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For me, the real question comes from the distribution of large font collections as add-ons to other products (usually design apps). In this case, the 'market' won't punish them for this behavior. It will, in fact, most likely reward them. What bothers me is that most non-designers I speak with don't perceive fonts as hard or time-consuming, or as important at all. The fonts aren't so much 'free', as much as they're just&hellip; there. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, I am as thrilled as the next person by Adobe's font offering with InDesign CS, but it removes the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->choice<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I think the act of having to choose one's fonts adds perceived value. It forces one to focus on what they want <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> need. I think this is more key than the presence or absence of money. Imagine if someone chose only novelty fonts with their purchase of MS Office. I think they'd learn the value of the 'boring' standbys pretty quickly (I hope). It might even force them to consider the differences, which previously seemed non-existent.</div>

This is because we live in a world with lots of corporations but very little corporatism, so most people look at the word and think it has something to do with corporations as they exist in modern business. Corporation are essentially a mechanism by which the owners of capital limit their personal liability for the decisions they make by making the corporation itself a legal person. Corporatism, arguably and ironically, has more in common with unionism than with corporate capitalism, but at the same time it is neither socialist nor capitalist. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Corporatism is an application of Catholic social teaching, derived from the Papal encyclicals <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rerum novarum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1891) and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quadragesimo anno<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (1931), which attempted to circumvent the conflict of capital and labour by promoting class collaboration based on the dignity of work and collective organisation in part based on the model of the Mediaeval guilds. Under a corporatist system, professional organisations become the primary political organ in a society. In this context, it is easy to see how education can be corporatist, along the lines of apprenticeship and professional accreditation. Most professional associations &ndash; e.g. the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada &ndash; are, in fact, corporatist bodies, but operating within a non-coporatist system, e.g. capitalism. I think that many professional associations would be more effective if they understood and adopted an explicit, underpinning corporatist philosophy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Corporatism fell out of favour after WWII because the Italian Fascists had implemented a form of it through their 'guild' system. It is worth noting though that the economic historian Amintore Fanfani, later Prime Minister of Italy, had already rejected false corporatism of the fascists in the 1930s. By contrast to fascist dictatorship, corporatism has also appealed to anarcho-syndicalists as a model of collaborative, non-authoritarian organisation and decision making. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Corporatism remains a kind of ideal of Catholic social and political organisaion.</div>
