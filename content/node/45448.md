  just went online. Details on the link; this is the important bit: \r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nAn
  exciting and challenging Knowledge Transfer Partnership has been established between
  the University of Reading's School of Arts & Communication Design and Monotype Imaging
  Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe 24-month project aims to utilise academic expertise to recapture
  know-how embedded in Monotype's library drawings for legacy technologies, and formulate
  a testing and development process to generate new, extended character set typefaces.
  Building on the recognised quality of Monotype's library new, multi-script typeface
  families will be developed during the project. The role will be based at Monotype
  in Redhill, Surrey. \r\n\r\nYou will have a BA 2.1 or above or a MA in Typography
  or related field with experience in digitising and testing typefaces. You will have
  some experience of developing extended character set typefaces, and preferably some
  experience with non-Latin typeface design. You will be proficient in Fontlab, with
  demonstrable experience of developing OpenType fonts. You will have strong research
  and documentation skills, and good communication skills. You will be organised,
  meticulous, and a good collaborator.\r\n</cite>"

    description. How is Reading involved? Does the position involve using students
    to do the work?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Indeed this is an abbreviated  description. No students are involved, although
    I suspect that graduates may apply. \r\n\r\nThe scheme is part-funded by the company,
    part by the UK Technology Transfer Board. The University employs the designer,
    who gets seconded to the company, and provides the academics' time for contribution.
    The day-to-day reality looks very much like the person is employed by the company,
    but with close contribution by the academics involved. \r\n\r\nThe objective is
    to enable companies to capitalise on expertise in UK universities for strategic
    benefits. The scheme has been very successful, but this is the first such project
    focused on typography (full details [[http://www.ktponline.org.uk/default.aspx|here]]).

  body: "It seems pretty clear to me: taxpayers give money to the government, the
    goverment gives money to the University of Reading, Reading gives money to a type
    designer, who goes to work at Monotype, and folk in the typography department
    at Reading provide input and advice on the work...\r\n\r\nAll with the aim of
    teaching Monotype how to make digital versions of their old typefaces that don't
    look like crap. One might say that it's about time."

  body: "From [[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/ktc/Companies/ktc-costs.asp|here]]:\r\n\r\nHow
    are KTPs funded?\r\n\r\nEach KTP is part funded by a Government grant to the University.
    This contributes to the costs it incurs through participating in that particular
    Knowledge Transfer Partnership, whilst the balance of the costs directly attributable
    to the project is borne by the business partner."

  body: "\"I wonder though why taxpayers have to pay for that instead of Monotype

    digital versions that don't look like crap\" doesn't end up exclusively with monotype
    but rather within the research community and thus usable (and improvable) by others. "
