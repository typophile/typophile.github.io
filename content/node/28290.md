  advertising, etc.) for my husband's company.  I did this for free and there are
  no contracts of any sort involved.  \r\n\r\nHis business partner is trying to buy
  him out of the company.  Currently, most of the company's worth is in the brand
  that I have created.  \r\n\r\nMy question is, who owns the designs?  Do I own them
  since I received no compensation and did not sign anything to release them?  Would
  it be assumed that they were created for use by the company and thus belong to the
  company?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any guidance you could offer.  Thanks!"

    you will have to be able to prove that you designed the logo &c. (dated sketches,
    mails). Just to make sure, you could have had your designs registered, and probably
    should still do so. Also, one could still assume you at least silently agreed
    with the use of your design (which you did), what possibly might be an argument
    in favour of the firm's right continuing to use it.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest you come
    to a personal accord with your husband's business partner. Make an estimation
    of the brand's value, that is, what you would charge if you were to make the designs
    now, in a strict business relation. The design is only part of the brand's value,
    since its renown probably is more the result of the company's business activities
    and merchandising. (Remember the CocaCola logo precedent.) \r\n"

  body: I don't have my GAG book here with me. But, from what I recall, if there was
    no contract signed the rights fall with the designer. (I hope others comment,
    and I will check the book tomorrow.)

  body: "I think you'll find that the identity work is an asset of the company, the
    value of which should be taken into account in the partner's offer price. As it
    appears you provided the work to the company free of charge I can't think you're
    entitled to any compensation related to the sale of the company. \r\n\r\nHowever
    now that the company is being sold, I'd suggest invoicing for the work completed
    based on your hourly rate and time put into it. I don't think you're going to
    get more than that even though you feel the company's worth is is mostly in the
    logo. Look at Apple - the guy who drew the logo got nothing, he's not even on
    Steve's Xmas card list :-( "

  body: "Thank you all so much for your insight.\r\n\r\nBased on your replies, I feel
    I should clarify my position.  We have no intention of letting this guy buy us
    out.  He is a bully and is trying to force us to sell, but he has no legal availability
    to force us out.  \r\n\r\nI had read some things that seemed to give precedent
    to the fact that I would own the logo, et cetera.  It would give us very much
    the upper hand in negotiation were this true.  Anyway, I'm not really interested
    in receiving compensation for the work per se.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help!
    \ I really do appreciate it. :)\r\n"

    folks who frequent this forum, have nothing but good things to say about Frank
    Martinez. He's a former graphic designer turned lawyer, very smart, very principled,
    and knows endless amounts about intellectual property law.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.martinezgroup.com/index.html\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n(no,
    I don't get a cut of his profits, and he hasn't done any work for us at Adobe,
