  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/armasen/caturrita-extra/|Caturrita Extra]] is a re-evaluation
  of a typeface family with several adjustments in features with a more careful look.
  \r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/armasen/caturrita-display/|Caturrita Display]]
  is a new version of Caturrita. Better for titles and small pieces, with a large
  contrast in the heavy weights.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your support!\r\nHope
  you like it."
