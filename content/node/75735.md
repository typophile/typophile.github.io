  endzones feature a bold italic slab serif, all caps.\r\n\r\nThe 'K' is pretty unique,
  hopefully it will help the ID.\r\n_\r\nMy apologies, but these are the best images
  I could find. Apparently most (myself included) are more interested in the on the
  field action, not what's ON the field.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iowa_6117.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hawkeye_6517.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kinnick-1_4898.jpg]"
