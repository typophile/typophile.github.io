body: Suggestion to improve the typographic design? I feel the text are too skinny,
  will break off against any poor printing. Also not sure about the color and type
  choice. Please critique so I can improve. Thanks in advance...

  body: "I'd change the color of the subtext, the contrast is too low against a white
    background. \r\n\r\nRegarding the type of organization, I'd prefer a softer main
    colour. Magenta is kinda harsh to me. But that's something personal.\r\n\r\nThe
    text in italic and the logo are now leaning towards each other. Is that what you
    wanted? Maybe you could make the logo a bit more upright.\r\n\r\nOver all, it
    looks quite calm and neutral. Which is good, I suppose."

  body: "With a quick look, I feel that the modified G on the right might be improved
    by removing the perspective distortion on it that now makes it slant back and
    to the left. It seems like an unnecessary additional feature.\r\n\r\nYou could
    also play with making the ends of the G sharper to make the shape's identification
    with the letter, not just the graphic of a head, clearer. Possibly making the
    left side of the arrowhead bigger than the right side might help. As is, it took
    me a second to realize that this was a face <em>and</em> a letter.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    to help with \"reading\" the G as well as a face, you might rotate the G so that
    it looks more typical, with the face slightly looking up. That could also be suggestive
    of the organization: looking up toward hope.\r\n\r\nMaybe the star could be in
    the same color as the subtitle (\"for domestic violence and abuse\") to unite
    the image?\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with all of Jorik's suggestions, especially the
    angle of the type and the G."

  body: "I agree with Jorik and Reed\u2014if this logo is going to appear on white
    on a regular basis, it's  a bad idea to set the second line of text in yellow,
    as it's going to result in that text being illegible much of the time. And unless
    there's some good conceptual reason for the perspective effect, it doesn't need
    to be there. \r\n\r\nI'd lose the either the cross or the arrow in the big illustrated
    G. There's already a lot going on in that logo as it is, adding either of those
    really pushes it over the top. The arrow pointing up gets the point across on
    its own, if the client really insists on sticking the cross in, pointing at it
    is just too much."
