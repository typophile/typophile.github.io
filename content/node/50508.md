  character who is obsessed with good typography. \r\n\r\nIn his faux manifesto he
  states: \"...technology conveys thoughts more cleanly and rationally than our imperfect
  mortal abilities.\" \r\nWith a footnote that reads:\r\n\"I admire the effort of
  men who hand kerned type, but when I look at\r\ntheir work, I see fragments of sloppiness
  everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this odd experience, I did a whois search of the domain
  maxkerning.com to find it belongs to Extensis.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking maybe they have
  some sort of new kerning technology? Anyone have more info? Insight?"

  body: definitely you have stumbled on to some kind of viral marketing campaign.
    The name of the site is probably being spread around at technology conferences
    with little to no explanation right now or soon. No idea whether it relates to
    an upcoming product though.

    me of what I *imagined* group sex would look like.\r\n\r\nFor ease of kerning,
    I recommend Chinese."

    talk for me to bear and too little information. But I am amused that Extensis
    uses the term \"Manifesto\" as did Igino Marini's <a href=\"http://www.ikern.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">iKern</a> site before. Could be a coincidence. Is it?\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    that Obama had a \"Manifesto\" he went out to get one too - I think he found it
    on Craig's List."

    information.</cite>\r\n\r\nKarsten, yes. If the web designer got it right, the
    advertisement is aimed at lower-level managers who are trying to justify their
    job to slightly-higher-level managers -- \"See, I'm organizing!\" \"I got stuff
    to enhance productivity\" and \"I'm sending people to seminars.\"\r\n\r\nOf course,
    I've been wrong before, and am reputed to be somewhat of a curmudgeon."

    didn't he? I mean after her heard that Karl Marx had one, he went out and got
    one, too :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
