body: "Hello again!\r\n\r\nI have a question about footnotes that has been bothering
  me for a while now:\r\n\r\nI'm working with footnotes on a book, and it happened
  that a word which needs a footnote is sitting on the bottom line of the page. When
  I put the actual footnote in place, the word referenced goes to the next page; if
  I put the footnote in the next page, the word obviously goes back to the previous
  page. What can I do in these cases?\r\nI asked my professor about it and he said
  I could increase the size of the text slightly \u2013 10pt to 10.1pt, for instance
  \u2013 on that page only and not touching the line spacing at all. According to
  him, the reader won't notice the difference in size, the word will go to the top
  of the next page, and I'll be able to set the footnote very comfortably.\r\nBut
  I'd like to know, is that a common practice? I don't feel this like a good thing
  to do, even if it solves the problem.\r\nAlso, the endnotes possibility is discarded.
  I just hate to go back and forth a book in order to understand it.\r\n\r\nI'd love
  to know your opinions on this issue!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nHenrique"

  body: "I think your professor has the right idea about forcing both the word and
    the footnote onto the next page.\r\nThere are several ways to do this.\r\nMost
    cavalier is to introduce an extra paragraph break.\r\nYou could also increase
    word space selectively to \"gain\" an extra line."

  body: "Henrique,\r\nWhen someone setting type is setting justified composition (squaring
    up the lines of type evenly on both sides), they are adding a tiny amount of word
    space to push the text out evenly to both margins. They do this to give the page
    a particular aesthetic that book readers are quite used to seeing. Just as they
    have not committed a crime, your minute adjustment to move a word to sit on a
    page with its footnote not only is not a crime, but fulfills a functional task
    as well. Fear not, the Type police will not arrest you for chosing the lesser
    of the two evils :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Chris, I believe that Henrique is referring to whole lines that move when
    the footnote itself is placed on the page, unfortunately. (Think about it: a footnote
    takes up it's own line(s) plus some intervening space, so it can displace a disproportionate
    amount.) So, the issue isn't one of tightening up to gain a word or even two.
    It's probably more like two or three lines worth.\r\n\r\nThis is a real challenge.
    I would look over the spread and even the spread before and see whether there
    are any paragraphs that can be easily pushed here and there, coupled with maybe
    running a spread a line short, to get enough of the problematic lines pushed,
    so that the footnote and reference can both be pushed to the following page. \r\n\r\nAlternately,
    related strategies could be explored to pull enough lines to keep them together
    on the original page.\r\n\r\nBasically, this kind of problem requires looking
    further back to find room to move.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the point size by a tenth
    or two for a single page (or spread) would be a last resort for me. But your professor's
    probably right. As much as one would hate to do it, it probably would be invisible
    to most. I suppose if it's invisible to your own eye, then go for it. \r\n\r\nOf
    course, if you can move the lines with just a tenth or two point size increase,
    you can probably do it with careful word-space strategies as well.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: "I'd simply shorten that page by one line without any adjustment to the other
    lines, the way it's customarily done to avoid widows and orphans.\r\n\r\nChanging
    the text size and thus the line height messes up the baseline grid in case there
    is one -- which should be the case for a proper document."

  body: "The usual convention (at least in the States) in a book with footnotes is
    all pages have the same depth, and unavoidable whitespace is put between the text
    and the note. Now if footnotes are few and far between, this won't work, and you
    have to revert to making up pages as you would in a book with endnotes.\r\n\r\nThe
    laying out of pages part of composition is just as important as the H&J. To me,
    the obvious solution is to go back to earlier pages in the chapter and look for
    a place you can \"make a line,\" so the problem word appears on the \"next\" page
    regardless. In this case, \"saving a line\" earlier in the chapter will work only
    if you were almost there anyway.\r\n\r\nThere are any number of ways to make or
    save a line, depends on both the copy as set, and the layout program. But you
    have just encountered an example of what I try to tell designers who've never
    set type: it is all compromise, and these compromises cannot be solved by applying
    a hierarchy of rules. If they could, we would write a computer program to do the
    work; case-by-case human judgment wouldn't be needed.\r\n\r\nOf course, like any
    puzzle, one solution may create another problem. Just keep working.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the one thing I haven't see mentioned is to slightly widen the margins on the
    offending spread. You can easily take the margins from, say, 25 picas to 25 picas
    three points, and no one will be able to tell. If that saves a line, you're home
    free. Alternatively, narrow the margins, again by 3 or so points, which might
    make a line.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the world of composition.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nEdit:
    You might also want to make a note of any changes you make to solve pagination
    issues. I don't know if they teach this in school, but in the real world, there
    are \"Author's Alterations\" and \"Editor's Alterations,\" which occur after you
    finish. Actually, you didn't \"finish,\" that was just \"first proof.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    can easily happen that an author or editor will change the copy so you'll want
    to take out an earlier fix. BTW, after first proof, you'll want all your reworking
    to keep the copy on each page the same, if possible, Likely the publisher or author
    has just paid considerable money to have an index made up from first proof, and
    changing what words fall on what pages could affect the index.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    sometimes an alteration means the text just has to change pages. For that reason,
    I prefer to change the characteristics of the page -- i.e., the margins, over
    the copy that (at one time) falls on a page -- i.e., the type size.\r\n\r\nDid
    I say welcome to the world of composition?"
