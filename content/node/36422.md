    blogs (like anyone other web-based personal showplace, u, u, u/me, me, me) do
    tend to be lame.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: The best way to follow the blogs is either to follow the tracker which will
    show you all new threads (blog or otherwise) and all new action on the threads.
    Another option is to subscribe to the blogs using a reader such as Google's.

    at a place like http://www.bloglines.com/ or just maintain one in the wiki here.\r\n\r\nThe
    /blog page is just for folks using the blog tool here, right?"

  body: "Yes.\r\n\r\nAll I use mine here for is to post up notices that my Flickr
    page and/or my \"real\" blog has been updated -- never have figured out why this
    is the sort of \"feature\" anyone would ever use for much else here, given the
    preponderance of free blogs (Blogger, WordPress, etc.) out there that are infinitely
    more customizable....\r\n\r\nWould someone please address why the blog seems to
    be \"better\" than the late and lamented IM? \r\n"

  body: "@Hiroshige: Sorry the lack of a blog directory is lame to you, but in the
    future perhaps it will be more valuable. For the time being, forum directories
    are our priority.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed a huge increase of interest in the blog
    feature (totally optional) since we opened it up to all users (understandably
    so). Most importantly, the blog feature has allowed a lot of new users to have
    a venue for their thoughts and comments, when sometimes they may feel intimidated
    by the big boys in the forums -- a common issue. \r\n\r\nThe Typophile blogs are
    in no way intended to be a replacement to WordPress or Blogger. I'd imagine there
    are a lot of people here who would simply like a place to vent typographic frustrations
    to a specific audience, when maybe their other blog about knitting sweaters for
    kittens isn't exactly the place to do so. \r\n\r\nThe IM feature was really kind
    of lame and doesn't benefit as many people nor add anything very unique or valuable
    to the site. A small handful of people used it, it was terribly buggy and a little
    annoying, IMHO."
