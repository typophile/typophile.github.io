  (desktop printers and such) such as Charter, Oranda, Amerigo, and even the Stone
  family. I'd like to understand more about the characteristics that make these fonts
  more appropriate for the low-res environment.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I've pretty much
  settled on using <a href=\"http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=23\">Stella</a>
  for my own business where my output would consist mainly of my inkjet printers and
  clients who print PDF documents and presentations that I produce for them. I tested
  several fonts, including Proxima Nova which printed very clean -- cleaner than Stella
  -- but my wife (who needs glasses to read) still felt that Stella was easier to
  read. Where exactly do you strike the balance?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

  body: "Much of the performance on low-res output may be in the hinting. Proxima
    might have better hinting than Stella, but it doesn't read as a well for long
    texts because it's more geometric. \r\n\r\nI would seek a typeface designed for
    text that has simple, sturdy forms (Charter, Oranda) and good hinting. The trouble
    is that it's difficult to judge hinting before purchase. It's one thing that type
    makers and sellers need to document more clearly."

  body: "Can you judge hinting at all by the \"type-tester\" outputs at different
    sizes?\r\n\r\nWhat about sans serifs designed for low-resolution? While faces
    like Charter and Oranda are nice, I've never cared much about using bold weights
    of serifed text fonts -- I've always preferred a sans companion. Perhaps I should
    change my ways...\r\n\r\nIs low-resolution output something other freelancers
    consider when creating their identity, or am I being overly obsessive about it?\r\n\r\nWow
    -- three more questions. Sorry."
