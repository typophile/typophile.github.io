body: "Identification would be much appreciated ... at first I thought it was Archer
  and then realized the only similarites were the slab serifs and ultra-lightness
  of it. I love the unusual letter shapes and would like to know who it is!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Thanks all ... unfortunately the typeface isn't available for licensing. I
    like Stag, but it doesn't have a good regular weight which would be problematic
    for me.
