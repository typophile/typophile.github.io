  called HERMA. it's already out and being used, and seems to work fine. (so there
  aren't any changes to be made, really.)\r\n\r\nstill we'd love for whoever is interested
  to give an open an honest critique. don't hold back, feel free to mention anything
  on your mind. cheers,\r\n\r\ncurtze"

  body: 'I see Verdana as well. Although, your typeface could look like a lot worse.
    Did you reference Verdana as you designed this? It almost seems like a normalized
    -- not for screen -- verison of Verdana. '

  body: "I like the overall feel of the type, even though it indeed seems like a slightly
    narrower, slightly heavier Verdana. The shapes of the bowl though, and the way
    they connect to the stems is beautiful and a subtle way of showing its own face.\r\nToo
    bad it doesn't have a proper, real, italic. That together with small caps and
    old style figures would really finish it off.\r\n\r\n Look after Goodness & Truth
    \r\n& Beauty will look after itself"

  body: "There are some problems with terminal angles which are especially pronounced
    in the heavier weights. Also, some glyphs have balance issues; the \"8\" looks
    like it's about to fall over to the left.\r\n\r\nLooking very closely, there are
    some weight problems in the curves in all weights of \"S\", \"s\", and \"\xDF\".
    Also, the \"perfection of construction\" of the \"V-Y\" and  \"v-y\" isn't helping
    those letters; the interior angles should be a little be greater to visually equalise
    the stroke weights. The X and x seem to be horizontally and vertically flipped,
    so the letters appear top heavy.\r\n\r\nOn the last page, check out the big \"can\"
    in the second line. Besides the right side of the \"c\" needing some fine-tuning,
    it also needs a little less sidebearing.\r\n\r\nHope I don't sound too harsh.
    This is pretty nice work, but there are some issues which stand between Herma
    and greatness."

    body: "thanks for your input. overall, without making any excuses, we had little
      time and even less experience, when we churned the thing out. i wonder whether
      the client would be open for a revised version after a year or so...\r\n\r\nregarding
      the verdana: yes, there was some inspiration there. i feel the verdana is actually
      a very nice font at small sizes, the larger it gets the more it looses its beauty.
      and the task for HERMA was to create a single font that works both large size
      and large amounts of copy.\r\n\r\ni had noticed the balance issue on the 8,
      but had found no elegant way to correct that. some of the other details you
      mentioned i honestly hadn't noticed as being grave. for me the type was part
      of the overall corporate design package, and i was worried about the overall
      feel. now that it's out, i wish i had spent a little more time \"tweaking\".\r\n\r\ngo
      ahead - keep criticising!"

    This type has potential, and for a fresh creation by designers with little experience,
    it is very good indeed.\r\n\r\nDid you start with any font's outlines, or was
    everything drawn \"from scratch\"?"

      type for the corporate design, and started playing around with the verdana shapes
      to get some idea of what i was looking for. i knew i wanted a less generic character
      but a similar feel with body type. \r\n\r\ni also had a good look at nuri and
      faceplate, but neither qualified as corporate font. and of course thesis sans
      is always good to use. so overall i can't really say i worked from scratch,
      and i did no drawing on paper at all.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ncurtze"
