body: "Hi there,\r\nI have a major problem with InDesign CS2 not recognising kerning,
  neither class based nor classic kern table. InDesign CS1 works perfectly fine. I
  am generating OT TTF flavoured with all the necassary boxes ticked in FL 5.0.2 (see
  pic)\r\nI know of at least another 3 people experiencing the same problem. \r\n\r\nCan
  anybody help?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\nvik"

  body: "It's been said before: InDesign won't recognize kerning unless there is at
    least one GSUB element (ligatures, fractions, ordinals, something). In short,
    if you ain't got no GSUB, you don't get no GPOS.\r\n\r\nMake up one substitution
    feature & recompile. You should now get kerning in InDesign."

    practice remains to be questioned though.\r\n\r\nVik"
