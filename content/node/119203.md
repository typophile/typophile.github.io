  concept, and the typeface I want to use.\r\nBlog Name: LIVRE (book in french)\r\nTypeface:
  League Gothic (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/League-Gothic) \r\n\r\nEverything
  was going well during my design phase until multiple people said at first glance
  it looks like liver. Definitely not what I want my blog to represent. Toxin gathering
  organ.  So you can tell me if I should continue with what I was doing, change the
  name (maybe libros) or just scrap the whole thing? I attached my first draft of
  the logo."

    typeface goes very well along with the chosen title and subject matter (unless,
    of course, you are intentionally aiming at contrast)."

  body: "I think the whole LIVER issue stems from the fact that few Americans speak
    French these days (I'm one of the few, so the name works for me). \r\n\r\nLibros
    is Spanish, yes? So it may have a higher recognition factor.\r\n\r\nI like your
    logo designs, especially the two on the far left (top and middle). To Riccardo's
    point, you may want to consider the tone you want to set with the typeface, but
    I think you've done quite well already. Your content will inform the logo, and
    together they'll create your brand."

  body: "If you\u2019re going to change the title, you could use the singular \u201Clibro\u201D,
    which means \u201Cbook\u201D both in Spanish and in Italian.\r\nOr, going the
    other way, maybe using the plural \u201Clivres\u201D could lessen the likelihood
    of someone misreading it."

  body: "Two thoughts off the top of <em>ma t\xEAte</em>:\r\n\r\n(1) In general, words
    decode more easily in caps and lowercase than in all caps (some followers of this
    site may not share that opinion). It's worth a try, though the effect is diminished
    in words with few ascenders or descenders (such as <em>Livre</em>).\r\n\r\n(2)
    You've included a sort of icon in your logo, a ribbon bookmark that sometimes
    stands in for the letter <strong>I</strong> and sometimes appears as a decorative
    element. If you're going to include an icon, why not make it a stylized picture
    of a book, so it helps your readers decode the title word?"

    replaced by Spanish. \r\n\r\nOlder readers may remember French from their school
    days. Younger folks probably not.\r\n\r\nYou might try an image that looks like
    a book, and maybe even a small caption that explains the name."

  body: "Thank you everyone.\r\n\r\n1. I will be reviewing mostly urban fantasy, horror,
    sci-fi and fantasy\r\n2. I can try libro or libros. Right now, I'm open to try
    something new.\r\n3. I've tried the book idea but I couldn't get it to work. If
    you have any examples or websites I could go to I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAgain
    thank you for helping me."

  body: "In a different typeface, it maybe would be easy tu integrate V with an open
    book.\r\nBut I think the bookmark idea remains a better choice, as it's less trite
    and more to the point."

  body: "<em>mostly urban fantasy, horror, sci-fi and fantasy</em>\r\n\r\nThat's helpful
    to know. The unique value you offer your readers isn't the medium (books), it's
    the style and content of the books. \r\n\r\nThe condensed, rather plain sans-serif
    in your logo gives me a corporate/industrial/minimalist vibe. For the genres you're
    reviewing, I would use type and/or imagery that feels edgier, grungier, lustier."
