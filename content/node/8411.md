  body: Roger there is a thin version of Avant Guard but I don&#39;t know if it is
    digitalized and I don&#39;t think the alternatives on the font are digitalized
    on any version. I think there was a concern that the alternatives were being abused
    rather than used with discression. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
