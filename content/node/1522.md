    think is  <BR>really seen in the <b>a</b>. Here are some things I notice: <BR>
    <BR><b>n,m,h,u,b,d,p,q,t:</b> Check the stroke modulation. It seems a <BR>little
    wobbly. Particularly in as the horizontals lead up to  <BR>and transition into
    the verticals in the branches and bowls.  <BR> <BR><b>t:</b> Crossbar is too short!
    <BR> <BR><b>g:</b> Check the spacing in the waist. You may need to <BR>open it
    up a bit to prevent clogging. <BR> <BR><b>w:</b> Looks wide. I think you took
    two v&#39;s and put them  <BR>together. This is fine, but I usually narrow each
    before  <BR>doing so. It makes the fit better with other characters and  <BR>keeps
    it from getting too wide. &#40;same goes for an m made  <BR>of and n &#43; an

  body: Hi Addison, <BR> <BR>Looking good, and you haven&#39;t lost the funkiness.
    The proportions look fine to me. You might consider deepening the crotch in the
    r. Otherwise it will square up at small size. Your 9 looks over rotated counter
    clockwise by about 5-10 degrees. You&#39;ll need to rework the tail to fix the
    problem. <BR> <BR>If I were you, I&#39;d press on. Whether or not it turns in
    to coins for you, there is more to learn. What would small caps look like? How

    to set. Descenders are too rare in actual text to &#34;deserve&#34; as much space

    that because they are infrequent they can afford to be shorter, and that it makes
    more sense to shorten the descenders than the ascenders. But this is not the same
    thing as saying that they <i>must</i> be short.

    One suggestion to bring them more into character with your roman set: <BR> <BR>A
    defining characteristic of the roman is the heavy horizontals found in your branches
    and bowls &#40;top curve of the h, bottom of the a, top of the m, bottom of the
    u etc - even looks slightly darker than the verticals&#41;. This is part of the
    funky. You might try that in your italic also. Granted the curves are much more
    abrupt in the italic, however, try a tad more horizontal emphasis in the tops
    and bottoms of the strokes. Pleased to hear you will be continuing! <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: Addison, It&#39;s looking great. I think the direction you are heading with
    the italic is great. Randy may be right about the heavy horizontals BUT it may
    be hard to get in the italic. You may not be able to go down that road, but some
    attempts might yield an answer. <BR> <BR>Hang in there! Looking forward to more.

    &#39;possibly&#39;. I think it may be that the bowl of the <b>p</b> is apparently
    larger than the bowl of the <b>b</b>. I love the forms of these letters but it
    looks like apparent sizing needs to be adjusted in these cases. <BR> <BR>Contact

  body: 'Couple of comments for you: <BR> <BR>1. Foot serifs on the roman r and f
    could extend to the right a tad to balance the letters. <BR>2. g appears to be
    leaning right. try moving the head left a touch to fix. The bicameral g is way
    too grotesque, consider... wait, wrong font. <BR>3. The spacing on the italics
    is loose &#40;agreed&#41; <BR>4. Try the dot of the italic i a hair to the right.
    Actually, you may want to revise the structure at the top. It looks identical
    to the n stem. The result is too left leaning at the top. It shows up as a hole
    when next to round letters &#40;as in the song: old mcdonald had a farm, eieio&#41;.
    To correct follow the italic angle a bit longer before exiting into the pothook.
    <BR>5. The k seem ok to me, just a little wide. Too much spacing to the right
    too! <BR>6. The w. Kern baby kern.  <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: Thanks for the feedback, guys. I&#39;m trying to finish the uppercase italic,
    then I&#39;m going to make some revisions per your comments and create another
    post. I also want to ask someone about the creation of small caps -- do you simply
    scale the uppercase and adjust the weight and width of the letter? Or is that
    cheating? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: 'Ok, I think I need some advice on creating italic capitals. I&#39;ve been
    referencing Caslon and Janson &#40;mainly Caslon&#41; and it seems that the capitals
    are slightly more upright than the lowercase -- except in cases of the A, V, and
    W, which are more angled. Please take a look at page 2 in the PDF below. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve modified the italic p &#40;smaller bowl&#41;, f &#40;exaggerated
    the curves a little more&#41;, i and j &#40;fixed the top and moved the dot&#41;,
    and t &#40;the top is scalloped and leans more to the right&#41;. The lowercase
    spacing is better, but the capitals are a nightmare. I&#39;ve restrained myself
    from kerning anything until the sidebearings are resolved. <BR> <BR>On the roman
    I extended the the right foot serifs on the r and f and the g doesn&#39;t lean
    anymore. Hrant, can you explain more about the k and the s? I want to make sure
    I understand what you mean. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still tweaking, but I&#39;ve got
    to let this one go one of these days. I feel the need to take Randy&#39;s advice
    and try something &#34;anti-funky&#34; and more refined. I still want to add small-caps,
    at least to the roman. Anyway... <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think, and thanks
    in advance. <BR> <BR>-Addison <BR> <BR><!--attachment: Specimen_1-13-04-24176.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*31.2*Specimen+with+italics*Specimen+1%2d13%2d04%2epdf

  body: Hildebrant, <BR> <BR>Yeah, there is. The ascenders begin to hook back to the
    left at the top and the descenders hook to the right. It just sort of came out
    in my doodles. I suppose this was part of my effort to add some variety in the
    angles--I had noticed that many italic faces applied varying angles to each character,
    which harmonized nicely as a whole. Is it bothersome to you? <BR> <BR>For anyone
    interested, I am still working on this. Spacing has proven to be the most tedious
    &#40;and not-so-fun&#41; aspect of type design. Small caps are also in the works,
    but I&#39;ll probably post another text sample when I finish the kerning pairs
    on the roman and italic. <BR> <BR>-Addison
