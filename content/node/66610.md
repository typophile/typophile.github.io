  body: "Thanks, hrant! That means a lot coming from you.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the
    Font Aid project, I need to check with my client first, whom is also a friend.
    Also thinking if I enter this into that, I'll have to go without the interior
    fill. Leaving the incisions as the color of the paper could be problematic. Are
    they taking every piece or being selective?"

    as the color of the paper it could present problems so instead I defined it as
    an outline:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mobius_4143.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the props on WLT, Tiff. Thank you, Lex for the kind words :o)"
