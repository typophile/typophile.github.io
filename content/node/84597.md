  join this community, this is a fantastic place.\r\n\r\nThis is a logo I'm currently
  working on, based on a chosen concept. It's not polished but already been through
  many revisions.\r\n\r\nI'd be really grateful for any knowledgeable input from you
  before showing it to the client.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nPlease be aware that it's my
  first attempt at designing type, so I'm kind of nervous, but then don't pull any
  punches, I want all of it!\r\n\r\nFirst off, is this legible enough?\r\n\r\nThen
  I have a problem with the 'a':\r\nThe entire logo is slanted, but you rarely (if
  ever?) see a 2-storey 'a' in italics (true italics anyway).\r\nThat's why I prepared
  a 1-storey version. I do like the 2-storey 'a' better though, but I wanted to confirm
  if it doesn't conflict with any sorts of typographic principles or is just a plain
  'wrong thing to do' before deciding on it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jcc_kali_0815_02-2story_4049.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jcc_kali_0815_02_1story_5211.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for any comments!\r\n\r\nPS. I'm planning to balance the 'o', I'm
  also thinking of making the whole thing less slanted, however I'm worried that 'z'
  would become less legible."

  body: "I quite like it, but agree that there are major legibility issues. I don't
    think the 't' works connected to the 'z' and 'r' at the bottom definitely looks
    too much like a 'y'. \r\n\r\nI'd be tempted to beef up the weight of the letteforms
    and give them some more space. I think the C formed from the bottom of the J needs
    to be closer to the rest of Choir. "
