  pages.\r\n\r\nThe utility I'm using, FontVista, crashes everytime it encounters
  a bad font file. I've been collecting fonts since 1992-- so needless to say, it's
  been crashing a lot!\r\n\r\nI would like to find some automated way to scan and
  trash these bad font files. I've been trying to use Suitcase Fusion for the task
  but, to my knowledge, it only scans and identifies (albeit cryptically) corrupt
  files. I then have to search my hard drive for the suitcase name, e.g. \"BTDem\"
  and \"RegNor\" and hope it turns up. Blech! There's got to be an easier way! If
  you know of any, please share your wisdom. Thanks!\r\n\r\n-K."

    of gray between 'good' and 'bad' fonts, most fonts are in between, and even the
    definition of 'good' is open to interpretation. So finding the fonts that crash
    the app may not be that easy."

  body: "Stephen, I haven't read the Suitcase manual cover to cover of anything but
    I think you can only print out one font per page when printing specimen pages
    in Suitcase, right?\r\n\r\nI've been using FontDoctor for the past day, since
    I posted this original message. It's a slow, slow process but hopefully it'll
    fix things so at least FontVista won't crash.\r\n\r\nWould anyone here know the
    reason why FontVista would print the default font (an Arial-looking thing) instead
    of displaying the real font on specimen pages? This is happening with about 5%
    of my fonts, including all my Emigre fonts. I checked the font folders and both
    the PostScript and bitmap files are in there. Until I hear back from FontVista
    tech support or find an answer here it's all a mystery!?\r\n\r\nOrganizing/fixing
    fonts for nearly 20 hours now and counting,\r\nK."
