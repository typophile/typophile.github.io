  time...\r\n\r\nIm starting out as a designer and would like to find a good book
  about type history that would include info such as the following:\r\n\r\n- genealogy
  of type such as: akzidenz grotesk -> helvetica -> univers\r\n\r\n- \"Like Serifa,
  Glypha is also based on the general scheme used to design Univers.\"\r\n\r\nIve
  seen histories like Lewis Blackwells 20th Century Type but they seem a too light.
  Id like something a bit more in depth.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!!"

  body: "Sorry, that last post was a mistake...\r\n\r\nMy intro was gonna be about
    how I was looking for books on how to choose the right font for a job (Im a beginning
    designer) and Ive ended up realizing that a little background info on a font helps
    you understand what that font could be useful for.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Im looking
    for a relational history is it helps me to remember and organize fonts in my head.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Mr Segalini, checked the book out in Amazon and looks pretty interesting. $84.39,
    though. Ouch, that hurts!\r\n\r\n"

    in Amazon. Looks good but quite surprised me that it dedicates almost 300 pages
    to serifs and about 50 to all the rest. Ill put it on my list though along with
    \"The elements...\".\r\n\r\nIts past 12 at night here in Madrid so hasta ma\xF1ana

  body: "Anatomy of a typeface is a very interesting book, but obviously out of date
    - though Lawson (who died a couple of years ago, RIP) has indeed some interesting
    things to say about sans serif as well. The book unfortunately is a no-design:
    mainly text, no layout, few images printed in a low quality... you might hold
    on if you already have some knowledge in type, otherwise you'll sleep after a
    dozen pages. \r\n\r\nThe two best books i've ever read about history of type are
    unfortunately (for you) in french, but they are worth learning the language because
    they don't have any equivalent in english, both written by yves perrousseaux:
    \"manuel de typographie elementaire\" and especially \"histoire de la typographie\",
    a huge encyclopedia about the history of typography, large format, nicely laid
    out, with an unbelievable amount of historical facts and references and filled
    with very high quality scans of terrific documents. volume one is out since last
    year, volume two is due to be released in september 2009. A must have, really.
    If you know any serious publisher in the US or UK, please try to convince him
    to translate this book. You won't regret it. \r\n\r\n*shameless auto-advertisement
    mode on*\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding how to choose a font for a specific job: there
    is my own book, which gives a detailed history of about 60 typefaces, their creator,
    the social background, the connotations of each of them, some examples, and a
    search tool; it also includes participations by Erik Spiekermann, Alejandro Paul
    or Xavier Dupre, and it really has no equivalent anywhere, by now. Unfortunately,
    it is again in french, and won't be out before september... again, if you know
    a publisher :-)\r\n\r\n*shameless auto-advertisement mode off*\r\n\r\nYou might
    also consider the lecture of \"the secret history of type\" by simon loxley, a
    nice book to read if you want to know some details about the lives of great typographers
    (though the informations are not always interesting, and once again the layout
    and the printing quality sucks)... But about in-depth info on type history, as
    far as I know, that's about it.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "Lawson's book may not be the flashiest book on type ever made but it really
    helps in understanding the history of type and how and why it evolved, if you
    are really interested on that and not only on identifying type styles and names
    give it a second tought. On the other hand it really is a text heavy book and
    you have to read it on episodes. Also there is no information of modern type styles
    on the book.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Univers might be misplaced on that genealogy (AG->H->U).
    If I my memory doesn't fail both faces were released almost the same year or so.
    Univers was inovative on the concept and execution of a type family as a system
    and performed better as text face, Helvetica on the other hand was a restyling
    of AG and performs better as a display face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    \r\n\r\n> well, it depends what you call \"modern\", if it is contemporary of
    course not, for the book was published a long time ago and the author died in
    2002; but there is indeed some info about sans serif types from the 20th century,
    and even if not a lot, it is quite interesting though.\r\n\r\nHelvetica and Univers
    were indeed released the same year. The actual genealogy would be something like:\r\n\r\nWilliam
    Caslon IV egyptian > Breite Grotesk > Royal Grotesk > Accidenz / Akzidenz Grotesk
    > Neue Haas Grotesk / Helvetica + Univers + Folio\r\n\r\nnot to mention all the
    revivals, inspirations, redesigns... including Standard / Basic Commercial, Arial,
    FF Schulbuch, Paralucent, Monotype Grotesque, FF Bau, Preface... and countless
    others.\r\n\r\ndr"
