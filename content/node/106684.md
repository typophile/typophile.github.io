body: "The new version of DTL OTMaster supports the new COLR and CPAL tables de\uFB01ned
  by Microsoft.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFirst there is a new color glyph viewer:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM3_CLR_1_5859.gif]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
  Color Viewer shows all the glyphs in de\uFB01ned in the COLR table. One can display
  the\r\ncomplete glyphs as well as the individual layers. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM3_CLR_2_5145.gif]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nEntries
  in the glyph color viewer are fully editable; the palette index can be modi\uFB01ed
  and individual layers can be added or deleted. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM3_CLR_3_5024.gif]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe
  content of the tables will be displayed as usual as a nested list.\r\nBelow is the
  example for the COLR table from Microsoft\u2019s Segoe UI Emoji font (part of Windows
  8.1).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM3_CLR_4_5215.gif]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis
  table is editable, one can create new entries, add color glyph records or change
  the palette index. This allows to add colored glyphs to any font with OTM in a simple
  way:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Create the necessary glyphs with OTM\u2019s glyph copy and editing
  tools\r\n\u2013 Copy an empty COLR/CPAL table from another font\r\n\u2013 Modify
  the COLR/CPAL table\r\n\r\nThe glyph palette CPAL is also editable and will be shown
  as follows:\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM3_CLR_5_5086.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  CPAL table can be edited as usual; records can be deleted, added, copied or modi\uFB01ed\r\nHere
  is an example for adding colored glyphs:\r\n1. Select the base glyph (in this case
  71)\r\n2. Copy it to new positions (246, 247, 248)\r\n3. Edit the glyphs (delete
  selected contours)\r\n4. Edit the COLR table\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM3_CLR_6_5936.gif]\r\n&nbsp;"
