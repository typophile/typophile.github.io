    <BR>3&#41; edit post <BR>4&#41; include link in original post <BR> <BR>The time
    of your original &#39;linkless&#39; post is the one  <BR>that will show up; any
    subsequent edits don&#39;t get  <BR>registered timewise. It&#39;s not really cheating,
    as  <BR>you <i>did</i> ID the type within a minute. ;&#41;'

    That old trick? =D</i> <BR> <BR>I guess we should contend on equal terms. Actually,  <BR>Stewf,
    I&#39;ve got this theory that any ID under the  <BR>5-minutes mark can be considered
    as an instant ID. <BR>It all depends of the frequency you set your e-mail  <BR>notification
    to. I sometimes have instant IDs where  <BR>afterwards I notice that the actual
    request had  <BR>been posted 10 minutes prior, just because my  <BR>e-mail program
    picks up new mails every 9 minutes. <BR> <BR>P.S. Hi Stewf, glad you&#39;re there.
    I guess we keep  <BR>missing each other on the Board, as it seems ages  <BR>ago
    I&#39;ve heard from you &#39;round these parts.
