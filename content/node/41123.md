body: I'm new to this site and have just been turned on to Paul Renner's typography.   I
  am very interested in Paul Renner's work.   My sources are limited due to a disability
  but just the same I would like some help with this subject if you can answer this
  question of who influenced him and what other typographers, type designers, or typophiles
  did he influence so I can check out their stuff as well...   I would certainly appreciate
  it.  You can e-mail me at climb_real_high@yahoo.com   Charles leonard, I would like
  to speak with you...  contact me please![img:sites/default/files/old-images/macosxlogo_4312.gif]
