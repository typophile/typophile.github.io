  body: 'Since the OP didn&#39;t come back yet, I will post the reply she received
    from the publisher. She sent it to me as a follow up for her request for an ID
    also: <BR> <BR><i>&#34;Thank you for contacting Ronnie Sellers Productions. <BR>
    <BR>In regards to your question about the font in the Power of Women <BR>calendar,
    you&#39;ll be interested to know that it is the artist&#39;s own font. <BR>Unfortunately,
    I do not have permission to give you this font.  If you <BR>are interested in
    more information, visit Jane Evershed&#39;s web site at <BR><a href="http://www.janeevershed.com/new/home.htm/"
    target="_blank">http://www.janeevershed.com/new/home.htm/</a>. <BR> <BR>Kind regards,
    <BR>Customer Service &#34;</i> <BR> <BR>[Note:  I told her it was a font I didn&#39;t
    recognize, and then I saw her post here. When I saw she didn&#39;t post the same
    information I thought maybe I could close it out for her by this method.]'

  body: Thanks, Mike...sorry I didn&#39;t follow up right away. I thought maybe someone
    else here might come up with some more &#34;close&#34; suggestions. BTW, Tempus
    Sans isn&#39;t too bad. Appreciate your help.... <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
