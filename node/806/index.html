  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was in a web design firm the other day, and the talk turned, naturally, to typefaces. I asked the web designer about typefaces and the prolific pirating of pretty much all typefaces, especially in design schools. He had an interesting and insightful comment about paying for typefaces, that &quot;it's against the spirit of typography&quot;. It is probably quite indicative of a lot of people's attitudes towards type: to expect payment is nonsense because one creates type for the love of it.  <BR> <BR>it was quite crushing. when i asked my type tutor whether he paid for his typefaces he scowled and said &quot;don't get all purist on me. how am i supposed to teach if i don't have the fonts?&quot; <BR> <BR>It starts from the ground up. How do other type tutors instill a sense of ethics in their students?</div>

Same for worker's compensation fraud. I lump all these criminals together and find no need to associate with them. <BR> <BR>As far as students pirating fonts, it seems that design schools should either supply legitamate fonts as part of the tuition, that instructors should require that the student supply a copy of their license to the legal department of the school for records, and that anyone using an illegal font receives an incomplete for the lesson.  <BR> <BR>I am mean.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I was in school, we had access to any typeface you could find a complete copy of&hellip; in a book. I comped a lot of headline type by hand. Even in the early 90s, it was assumed that the body type would be provided by the typesetter. You didn't key in your own type, if it was a headline you either drew it or ordered it. So, essentially, the fonts were free, you paid for someone's time, or you did it yourself.  <BR> <BR>When we all (us graphic designers) migrated to the computer, took the work away from the typesetter, we didn't ever think about why we would need to pay for fonts. Thus the corundrum about teaching an old dog new tricks.  <BR> <BR>I buy lots of fonts now, because I respect the work that goes into creation of type. It doesn't bother me to drop some cash to get something great like HTF Gotham or FF Scala Sans. <BR> <BR>Plus, it keeps me from having to comp type by hand.</div>

A suggestion to readers here: check it out if you haven't previously.) <BR> <BR>What I meant was an organization such as AIGA, that design instructors would already belong to. And get to them through a house publication such as an existing organization newsletter. <BR> <BR>Nick, perhaps you could ask at the University, whether there's a publication for design instructors, or whether all there is for something like this are just general instructor/teacher magazines. <BR> <BR> <BR>Mr Pemberton, I like your picture that you post here, by the way.
