  body: "It looks like Futura that has been edited to make the N more narrow and the
    K arms sunk into the stem more than normal. Other candidates were Mark Simonson's
    Mostra, which is a bit too condensed, or House Neutraface No.2, which doesn't
    look quite right.\r\n\r\nCan you tell if the \"PUNKT\" lettering is the same as
    the smaller text in the first image? That smaller lettering might help us, if
    it was the same font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
