  a graphic designer and a typographer and their obsession with fonts and legibility
  led to a painstaking effort to clean up America\u2019s road signs, one letter at
  a time. \r\n\r\nhttp://select.nytimes.com/preview/2007/08/12/magazine/1154684598978.html?ex=1186804800&en=a8c0a86a18d2357c&ei=5121&emc=eta1\r\n\r\n\r\nJust

  body: Congratulations, James. Not only is the signage in the picture clearer, but
    you've managed to halve the distance to the exit!

  body: Great article -- tremendously significant too, because it is probably the
    most detailed account of a single typeface that has ever been published in a general
    interest magazine. The writer did an exceptional job too, I thought, especially
    considering he's a recent J-school grad. Many far more experienced journalists
    have been hopelessly flummoxed by type and its arcana. Altogether most impressive,
    including, James, especially, the font - - very happy for you.

  body: James, I wasn't able to be at TypeCon this year, but a colleague of mine brought
    back a copy of your new "specimen book," the one with the business card primer
    for designers. I love this catalogue, and think it is the most refreshing idea
    for a catalog that I have seen in years!

    designed it. A brilliant graphic designer and a very good friend (and a pretty
    good type designer as well). We have another one in the works, sort of a design
    encyclopedia sort of thing."

    idea of branding has claimed a central role in American life, so, too, has the
    importance and understanding of type. Fonts are image, and image is modern America.\""

    bill also, as far as i can tell it was the biggest and best article about type
    in a mainstream magazine. (the only other comparable one, sort of, was in the
    new yorker about matthew carter).\r\n\r\ncongratulations james!!! and congratulations
    to all of us who are becoming more significant in popular culture  : )\r\n\r\n"

  body: Way to go, James! I read the article on Sunday morning... I liked Meeker's
    comments on design as a form of social activism -- they reminded me of some talks
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/User-Centred-Graphic-Design-Jorge-Frascara/dp/0748406727"><strong>Jorge
    Frascara</strong></a> gave at the University of Buenos Aires, when I was studying
    there.

    far probably the most comprehensive, and surprisingly enlightened article on type

    you can point them here!  There's also the coverage of the new approach to typography
    on prescription bottles as another example. \r\n\r\nHey James, do you happen to
    know if Puerto Rico has its own highway department? They don't need better signs,
    they just need signs. I think the hurricanes blow them down. Trying to find your
    way on the main highways is an exercise in futility. "
