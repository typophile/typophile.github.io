body: "The Bauhaus was a German college of architecture, art, and design, which existed
  in three forms from 1919\u20131933.\r\n\r\nThe Bauhaus was founded in 1919 by [[Walter
  Gropius]] in Weimar, joining to previous art and handcraft schools together. Named
  <em>Das staatliche Bauhaus in Weimar</em>, the school's political direction was
  radically socialist and revolutionary communist. This so angered the nationalist
  city government (see [[German Nationalism]]) that they cut the school's budget in
  1923, ironically just after the school had mounted a successful exhibition of international
  renown.\r\n\r\nInvited by the major of Dessau, Gropius moved the school to that
  city. Renamed the <em>Bauhaus Dessau: Hochschule f\xFCr Gestaltung</em>, the school
  entered its second phase. Housed inside the famous Bauhaus building, which was designed
  by Gropius and is still visible today, the school became decidedly \"modern,\" as
  opposed to expressionist. Gropius still had political trouble in Dessau, however.
  Despite hiding his own socialist sentiments, he was neither able to cool his own
  student's radical attitudes nor convince the city government that these were harmless.
  To save the school, Gropius resigned under pressure in 1928.\r\n\r\n[[Hannes Meyer]]
  replaced him. Meyer was a real communist, from Switzerland. He did not improve the
  situation for the school. Now faced to be doomed by history, as the city governments
  officers became increasing National Socialist (Nazi party members), the school tried
  another switch, bringing in the apolitical [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from Berlin.\r\n\r\nMies
  van der Rohe (hereafter \"Mies\"), from 1930 onward the head of the school, was
  piloting a sinking ship. He had to convince the city government that his school
  was not political (political meant, in this case, socialist/communist). He had a
  difficult time. Aside from the high number of socialist activities, the school's
  population was between 10 and 50 percent foreign. In these days, the word \"foreign\"
  was virtually synonymous with \"communist.\"\r\n\r\nIn a last ditch effort, Mies
  expelled the entire student body, and readmitted select students after a personal
  political interview. This only drove the political organization underground, and
  couldn't help the situation anyway, as the now ascendent Nazis were bent on closing
  the school.\r\n\r\nThe city government dissolved the college in 1932. Mies transfered
  his camp to Berlin, opening up a private school for architecture in Berlin, 1933,
  named the <em>Bauhaus Berlin</em>. The school entered its third and last phase.\r\n\r\nOn
  January 31, Adolf Hitler was named chancellor of Germany by President Hindenberg.
  In March, the Gestapo raided the school's Berlin campus, causing it to be shut down
  permanently.\r\n\r\nThe Bauhaus had collected an astounding collection of professors
  (called Masters in an effort to be more egalitarian), which included: Johannes Itten,
  Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, MArianne Brant, Marcel Breuer, Lyonel Feininger, Oskar
  Schlemmer, [[Lazlo Moholy-Nagy]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Joost Schmidt]], [[Herbert
  Bayer]], and [[Josef Albers]]. About 10 percent of the Bauhaus student body had
  come from the United States or Great Britain.\r\n\r\n<strong>Despite having created
  a myriad of avant garde typography, typography, type design, advertising, and printing
  were not key elements of the Bauhaus curriculum. The greatest typographic innovations
  of Weimar Republic Germany were all created at other schools, i.e., those in Leipzig,
  Offenbach, Stuttgart, and Munich.</strong>\r\n\r\nMany tried afterward to claim
  a piece of the Bauhaus legacy. A great number of masters emigrated to the US (some
  under enormous duress, some not). Moholy-Nagy founded <em>The New Bauhaus</em> in
  1937 in Chicago. This was viewed as a usurpation by Mies, who came to IIT in Chicago
  around the same time. In the 1940s, IIT absorbed the school.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s,
  the [[Hochschule fuer Gestaltung Ulm]] was founded in Ulm by Max Bill. Many former
  Bauhaus students and teachers were involved. The state closed the hfg down in 1968,
  in part because\u2014like the Bauhaus before it\u2014it was too foreign (almost
  50% foreign enrollment).\r\n\r\nToday there is a [[Bauhaus Universitaet Weimar]]
  in the old school buildings in Weimar. In Dessau, the state design school (the [[Hochschule
  Anhalt]]) uses part of the famous Gropius building. The rest is a museum and private
  graduate school for urban planning. Lastly, there is a Bauhaus Museum in Berlin,
  built in the 1970s based on plans drawn by Gropius."
