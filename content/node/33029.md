  antialiased in flash) in the website www.sagmeister.com. I think titles are set
  in Gotham, but the body copy has slight differences, that part away from gotham,
  giving it a little more rectangular angles.\r\nCan anyone help?\r\nThanx."

    pretty much which I would consider typical for Gotham."
