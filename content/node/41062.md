body: "I need to design a t-shirt with two words on it and am having trouble finding
  an appropriate typeface. The t-shirts are aimed primarily at 30-/40-somethings and
  are not 'comedy' but will probably raise a wry smile from those who get the reference,
  which is to a pop song from the eighties.\r\n\r\nI can't reveal the text yet (sorry),
  but it's along the lines of \"Like a Yo-Yo\" - i.e. lyrics from part of a song.
  If there is to be a whiff of retro about it, then it should be subtle.\r\n\r\nI
  would be very grateful for your suggestions!\r\nThank you,\r\nKate"

  body: "The original <cite>CHOOSE LIFE</cite> T-shirts designed by Katharine Hamnett
    were set in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/folio/bold-condensed/\">Folio
    Bold Condensed</a> (or something similar).\r\n\r\nFolio is generic-looking enough
    that it doesn't look overtly \"retro\" by any means, but people who get the reference
    will recognize the face from the original T-shirt, consciously or otherwise."

  body: It's hard not to think of 80s culture without [[Neville Brody]] and 'The Face'
    magazine coming to mind. How about his typeface [[Insignia]]? It's nice in all
    caps.
