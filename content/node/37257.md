  place.....\r\ni have 2 businesses here in charleston sc, one photography, one wedding
  hair on location.\r\ni am struggling with a logo and identity for my photo biz.
  i'm working on my \"style\" but want a \"feeling\" behind the site.\r\nretro and
  artistic fonts appeal to me, but i have no idea....\r\nplease look at my site: www.julietelizabeth.com
  \r\nany suggestions would be appreciated! (sometimes when you look at something
  too long you lose a sense of being objective).\r\nthanks!\r\nj"

    to help you or give feedback? It's a little unclear. "

    their kids for a logo for you. ;0)
