  picture is located in the middle of the The Big Book of Top Gear 2009.\r\n\r\nYou
  can see there is no serif, the 'G' does not have a tail, and the font is relatively
  condensed.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what font is being used? Much appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

  body: I have a feeling that the 'Good News!' and the 'The Dacia Sandero is in this
    book!' might be two different typefaces.

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\n'GOOD NEWS!' is written in DIN Neuzeit\xAE Grotesk Bold Condensed.
    \r\n\r\nBut 'THE DACIA SANDERO IS IN THIS BOOK' IS different, like I thought.
    Still trying to find out exactly what typeface it is."
