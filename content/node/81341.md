    one en wide; the consistency in width made columnar setting easier.

  body: "Many fonts don't have the U+2212 minus sign, but any that is intended for
    typesetting math really ought to. If it's just an incidental negative number in
    a body of text, and not a mathematics publication, a U+002D hyphen-minus should
    be adequate.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion.\r\nI'd go with oldnick and use an en-dash
    in columnar setting, just not in body text."

  body: "I often (eg Bodoni Egyptian, Figgins) make the en-dash and minus identical,
    so that the en-dash will \"do\" for the minus sign, and matches the plus sign
    in alignment, weight, and width.\r\n\r\nBut design-wise that's not always in the
    best interests of the typeface, so I don't make it a standard practice. "

  body: "The font you're using will probably have a plus sign and an equal sign. The
    minus is supposed to match them in length. If the font lacks a minus, use the
    nearest thing to it, which will usually be the en dash. If it's noticeably different
    from the ideal length, you can scale it!\r\n\r\nThe substitution of a hyphen only
    started to happen with monospaced typewriters and computers. Bringing that habit
    back to a proportional face is bad practice. In most text faces a hyphen is rather
    too small and can get overlooked. No matter what the context, the difference between
    a negative number and a positive one is going to be important enough that it <em>should</em>
    break the color of a body of text."

  body: Quite often our (academic journal) authors will use a hyphen for negative
    numbers in their manuscripts (simply because it's a helluva lot easier to get
    at than the proper minus, and/or they're unaware that the font may contain such
    a separate character), but our copyeditors will always replace it with a minus
    for the final typeset articles.

    lot easier to get at than the proper minus, and/or they're unaware that the font
    may contain such a separate character</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is one symptom of a larger
    problem.\r\n\r\nIn Latin-alphabet languages other than English, things are made
    worse by the need to accommodate accented letters on the conventional keyboard.
    But even on the English-language keyboard, several character positions make sense
    for computer programming only. They don't even make sense for \"word processing\"...
    business document typing, which used to be monospaced, but which, even with a
    proportional typestyle, is <em>not</em> typesetting.\r\n\r\nAn English-language
    keyboard, thus, for use in the U.S. environment, ought to be switchable into a
    \"word processing\" mode, where the following characters get substituted on the
    keys:\r\n\r\n~ is replaced by \xB1 \r\n` is replaced by \xBA\r\n< is replaced
    by \xB6\r\n> is replaced by \xA7\r\n| is replaced by \xBC\r\n\\ is replaced by
    \xBD\r\n{ is replaced by \xA3\r\n} is replaced by \xBE\r\n^ is replaced by \xA2\r\n\r\nFor
    <em>typesetting</em> mode, it is necessary to replace the underscore with the
    em-dash, to make \u2020 and \u2021 accessible, and, ideally, \u215B, \u215C, \u215D,
    and \u215E as well. (One doesn't need @ and # in that mode, which will help a
    little - ~ and ` can also have their substitutes changed. That's still two characters
    short, but the European keyboard <em>does</em> have one extra key...)\r\n\r\nAnd,
    as I've noted, for typesetting, the keyboard really should provide small capitals
    as a third shift, which would require turning Unicode upside down, as small capitals
    are not currently recognized as a \"case\".\r\n\r\nIf one is going to use a special
    symbol for minus, however, one has (in however much of a small way) entered into
    the domain of the typesetting of mathematics. At this point, one has reached a
    level at which \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here\" or at least \"May God have
    mercy on your soul\" seems like the appropriate comment.\r\n\r\nThus, while it
    is already foolish to hope that Windows (<em>or even the Mac</em>, which at least
    does offer special characters with an alt shift on its default keyboard) might
    someday offer \"US English - Word Processing\" and \"US English - Typesetting\"
    alternate keyboard layouts... making the math stuff handy goes beyond that.\r\n\r\nNot
    that it's impossible; after all, keyboards that looked like this\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scadet_6089.gif]\r\n\r\n(this
    is a drawing I made for my web page, so as to avoid rights questions; there are
    [[http://world.std.com/~jdostale/kbd/SpaceCadet.htm|photographs]] of this keyboard
    on the web as well, if you would like to see the real thing) existed, and there
    are the three keyboard layouts for the IBM Selectric Composer for Mathematical
    Greek, Mathematical and Technical elements, and various mathematical keyboard
    layouts for photocomposition machines... but we don't even get the APL layout
    offered to us as standard."

    a few additional characters.\r\n\r\nOh, and to address the original topic of this

    make sense under some conditions - under which the * and / keys on the numeric
    keypad ought to insert U+00D7 (\xD7) and U+00F7 (\xF7) respectively too. The trouble,
    of course, is determining when those conditions apply.\r\n\r\nUnder <em>normal</em>
    conditions, it would be extremely confusing for the keyboard to generate anything
    outside of the conventional ASCII range from U+0000 to U+007F from any key which
    could plausibly be associated with a character within that range. Of course, defining
    \"normal\" conditions as typing text into Notepad, Programmer's File Editor, or
    gedit for input into, say, a FORTRAN compiler <em>may</em> seem to some as being
    perverse these days...\r\n\r\nOh, and I even have a cute little reference chart
