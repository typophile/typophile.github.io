body: "Hello everyone!\r\nWe are a group of students doing a visual identity project
  about Como, Italy. We need font suggestions for the logo of the city we created:
  it should be sans serif and possibly coherent with the different identities of Como
  (romanesque decoration, rationalist movement of Terragni, liberty-inspired elegance).
  Attached some images of reference.\r\nWe were thinking of Neutraface because of
  its geometry matching that of our logo, but it turned out to be a predictable choice
  and the result was too \"fascist\".\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help."

    you could show us the logo, it would be easier to suggest less geometric alternatives."
