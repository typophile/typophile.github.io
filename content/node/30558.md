body: "We are seeing missing font errors in files that have Type 1 fonts as well as
  Open Type fonts in the file. We are moving to an Open Type environment and have
  been converting the stylesheets to now reference the Open Type version of the font.
  We are using Font Book 2.0 in OS 10.4.8 as our font management tool and have found
  that even when the fonts are active and being used correctly in the file (stylesheet
  applied) the typeface is subsetting from Regular to Medium. It throws a 'Missing
  Font' error and we don't know how to get around it. The font is accurate (InDesign
  substitutes the font with the correct one but sees the typeface as different) behind
  the pink text (our designers and QC staff would know what the font looks like but
  our Editors don't) but because there's pink highlight, it is assumed the font is
  missing. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen this? Is there a way around it?"

  body: "I noticed you are using Font Book for font management. Have you considered
    switching to a third party font management application? I personally have never
    had a smooth sailing experience with Font Book. I've tried many different 3rd

    Give it a try, it might magically work better than the prebundled Font Book.\r\n\r\nr

  body: erg8t, this is a very specific question regarding the substitution of an OpenType
    version of a font for deprecated PostScript version. In this case, it is assumed
    that the user knows which fonts are active. I'm a big fan of 3rd party font managers,
    but this is a case where basic testing of the font installed the system is appropriate.
    It may be the case that not all versions of Adobe's PostScript fonts map perfectly
    to the OpenType versions. Thomas Phinney probably has the best information available
    though...

    OpenType versions from some other source, which might have some of the same names

  body: "@growland: Is that particular stylesheet in any way connected with another
    one, eg changed and renamed, or a 'based on' one? Is the strange behaviour persistent
    with a new stylesheet using the same font and style? Do you have OT \xE1nd PS
    varieties of the same font installed on the machine and did you clear the font
    caches after changing the stylesheets to the OT-font?\r\nDid you test with the
    OT-fonts loaded by putting them in InDesigns font folder (located in the program
    folder)?"

    body: We have cleared the font caches and made sure the user did not have the
      Type1. Since our files move from user to user if a user opened up a file on
      a machine with type 1 Helvetica the next user would get the font missing message
      even though the font isn't used. It could be Stone Sans or Frutiger...it doesn't
      matter. We have learned that if it says"medium" it is related to that error.
      It seems to have only become an issue with CS2.
