  body: Bon Appetit uses typefaces by Commercial Type (Paul Barnes is a co-founder
    of it), e.g. <a href="http://twitpic.com/4ke5xl">Isambard</a> and I guess they
    also use Caslon Italian digitized by him.

  body: "Paul Barnes had a list of several early 19th century typefaces -- including
    Caslon's Italian --that he said were almost ready for release through the St.
    Bride Type Foundry. It would be interesting to see if they do surface through
    Commercial Type.\r\nDon"

  body: "I've long thought that Italian's stroke contrast is too literally inverted
    - it's like a contrarian, irrational teenager. There must be room for designs
    with more judicious, purposeful stroke inversion - a mature, collected iconoclast.
    Ugly doesn't have to be stupid; and smart ugly often ends up redefining beauty.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
