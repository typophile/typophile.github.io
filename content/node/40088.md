  like newsprint but can be sent through a laser printer. If anyone had any experience
  like this, or if you know of any paper stocks that simulate newsprint please let
  me know.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    white, but it is still pretty dark. Not really like newsprint though."

  body: I have tried sending regular newsprint paper through a small office photocopier,
    basically the same printing technology as a laser printer, and found that the
    toner won't stick tightly to the smooth surface. This was useful for a certain
    transfer technique, but not for general purposes. Fortunately it didn't jam the
    feed mechanisms, but I feared it would because of its light weight and limp body.
    I have not tried rough surfaced newsprint (such as that in artists pads), though
    I suspect the loose fiber in the surface might cause other problems.

  body: As a former seven-year Kinko's vet., I would suggest finding a small Canon
    copier with a by-pass tray. Those little copiers were amazing with the types of
    paper that would work! I tried everything from handmade paper to tissue paper.
    Viola! The hard part will be to first find one and two your stock size. The copiers
    I am referring to had an 8.5 inx 14 in max sheet size.
