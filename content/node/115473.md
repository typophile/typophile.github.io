body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nI accidentally found 1976 \"Official Caliornia visitor
  map\" scan on Flickr, and would like to know what exactly the main font is (the
  tri-color upper)? I checked 1977 Letraset font brochure, Linotype website and some
  retro design websites, but with no results as yet. There's even NO image o that
  font anywhere else. Kinda strange.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try to find and use this font
  for my design work, so any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you and best
  regards.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3750750324_07c661bd86_o_4867.jpg]"

  body: "Ryuk - in the Typophile thread you linked to, Robert Trogman said, \"I'm
    glad that it has been revived.\" I would think that confers legitimacy as much
    as anything, no?\r\n\r\nIn fact, nowhere in Victory Type's font description do
    they credit Mr. Trogman. You would think if they sought and got permission they
    would say so. And if they didn't, that almost makes Retro Stereo Wide <em>more</em>
    legitimate than Asteroid.\r\n\r\nMy point is that simply being for sale on MyFonts
    doesn't always confer that legitimacy (although, as one of the original MyFonts
    moderators, I can say we have caught and reported more than a few offenders and
    those fonts were dropped)."

  body: "Did anyone catch the comment by \"Character\" [Herbert F. Van Brink] on the
    Dafont site that Retro Stereo Wide is a \"reproduction of the rub-on font 'Circuit
    Double' produced in the 1980's by Formatt.\"  Bob Trogman, the original designer
    of the font,  said in http://typophile.com/node/76158#comment-438985 that \"his
    original release film font [in 1968 of] Yagi fonts [was] in the Facsimile Font
    program.  So the original California map could have been produced from rub-on
    letters by FotoStar, [or perhaps  Letraset]. Which may explain the differences
    in the 1976 image from Retro Stereo Wide, which may have been based a the 1980's
    Formatt version.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Ruyk, stealing type designs goes back at least as far as the invention
    of electrotyping in the 19th century. About all that is protected in a type design,
    at least under US and similar laws, is the the computer generated font outlines.
    Making a new font by recreating from a printed source seems to escape the wrath
    of copyright infringement. There is an exception for fonts that have design patents.
    But these expire in a few years. Lots of grey areas and potential for lawyers
    to get rich -- font designers rarely do :) \r\nBTW Myfonts is definitely the elephant
    in the room. If a font is not sold via Myfonts, it generally has very poor market
    prospects. Only a few large independents -- House, H&FJ etc. -- have been able
    to succeed as profitable ventures.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for the clarification, Mike even if, of course, there was no bad intention
    behind my word 'legitimate'. But as many free fonts are actually rip-off or illegitimate
    copy, I simply supposed Asteroid could be (legitimate). I should have remembered
    a font sold at MyFonts never proves its legitimacy. Lesson learned (again). The
    font business is definitely too much fuzzy and even worst when it comes to revival.
