  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,
I'm designing a campaign logo for a colleague, his first campaign. He has low name recognition and an unusual name. 

I posted a bunch of tongue-in-cheek awful logos with inappropriate fonts for amusement, before getting serious. The candidate and his friends discussed them as serious proposals, which astonished me. So I had to make a disclaimer. Here's the list:
<a href="http://digital-genie.com/customers/plants-logos.htm"><strong>Campaign logo proposals</strong></a>

Actually, the logo design was quite a challenge. I wanted to avoid the usual clichés and butt-ugly campaign graphics <a href="http://www.artplusinc.com/politicalsamples.htm"><strong>such as these</strong>.</a>


What do you think of number 11, which is the last design I came up with?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dorsolplants-logo-root-5i_5104.gif]

I wanted a image to increase the candidate's name recognition, obviously. (Luckily, Seattle is a plant-loving city.) I wanted a font that was distinctive, strong and "masculine," yet had some organic qualities, to harmonize with the "plant" theme. The font is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/breughel/"><strong>Breughel</strong></a> (designed by Frutinger). I had bought it awhile back, but ended up never using this odd hybrid of angled slab serifs and curved stems. I think it works here, though. The subtext is Raleigh, which to me has that same semi-organic look.

It will be in light and dark green.

Please comment - THANKS very much in advance!

		<div class="commentbody">Number 11 seems to be the closest to an actual appropriate logo for a candidate. It needs a bit of refining, but the others have too much of a gimmick.

As for no. 11, I would suggest moving the plant (shouldn't there be more than one plant?) to the right of his name. Moving the placement around makes the logo more about the name and less about plants. Having the plant on the left, and as tall as the complete name and the objective makes the logo more about that graphic and less about who should be for the city council. "Dorsol" also suffers from a lack of balance. Right now, "Dorsol" is floating as a separate element, and there is no tie to "Plants", which is your second most prominent element. You may want to make "Dorsol" the width of the "Pl" in "Plants" and have it sit on top. Take a look at your objective text, it actually works very well. Seattle is balanced above the capital "C"s as well as the lowercase ascenders.

If you are intent on making a reference/enforcing the plants to make it more recognizable, you may want to experiment with incorporating plants into the word Plants (i.e. taking your existing graphic and using it to tie "Plants" to the black area or "Soil"). This may be a bit more cliché then you would like to make it.</div>

There needs to be greater harmony, overall. Looking at this, we need to (think, at least) the elements are connected as opposed to just separately floating in space. 

I do think, however, you and your client's willingness to make a pun on his name are excellent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments...it's helpful. I'll continue working on this.

I'm not sure why Dorsol is "not connected" as you see it. It's very close and the same font, so why would it not read as two parts of a name? Maybe the D and P should line up.

I'll see if I can find a way to connect the plant image to the name better, on the right as imavery suggests, and still have the name highly legible. 

James, name recognition is of primary importance to a candidate for office, so using an image that sticks in people's minds is very useful. It's just fortunate that my client has a pleasant-sounding name to illustrate. If his name were "Buttski," that would be a problem. 

In fact, number 10 was my original design. Then my husband remarked that the two overlapping cloud shapes in the image, round to harmonize with the geometric font, looked like "a butt" to him. Maybe that says more about him than about the graphic. However, I altered it; but now that's what I see, anyway. 

The tall "l" in number 10 was supposed to suggest the Seattle Space Needle, highly stylized of course. But lacking <a href="http://www.seattlephotographs.com/photos/space_needle/Space_Needle_photo_gallery.htm">the distinctive curve of the Needle,</a> it looks more like an ordinary skyscraper, which is the opposite of what my client is about. If I made it more like the Needle, it no longer looked like an "l", plus the curve did not harmonize with the geometric font, Stymie.  

So I tried the approach with the plant, which is the way to go, I believe. It distinguishes my client from others.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I apologize, it was late and I wasn't clear. I'm not against the visual representation of the candidate's name, I wish more people running for office would be more open to breaking out of the boring yellowpages style. I think it makes them more human when they do something different, and less of just some office robot. What I meant is that the other samples didn't really focus on Dorsol Plants for Seattle City Council, but more on the feeling of something. For example, sample 2 doesn't invoke a feeling of comfort, but more of the plastic feel gotten from drive-in hamburger joints from the 50s, and at a glance it wasn't about getting Mr. Plants elected.

When I am working on balancing my typography, I try to imagine what would happen if the words above suddenly fell on the words below, and determine where they would break up. For example, if Dorsol was to fall on Plants, you would have three different break points.  Your D would stay, ors would fall between the l and the t, and ol would then fall to the right of the ts. If you apply the same exercise to for Seattle City Council, Seattle would only have one break, but it would continue to be recognizable as Seattle. Actually, logo 10 has much better typographical harmony, but at first glance it's a graphic about Seattle, and not Mr. Plants.

Campaign graphics are a hard subject to design for, because of the nature of campaigns. Often it's about name recognition and making it a memorable recognition at the time of voting.</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dp-logo-root3-bw_4147.gif]
The plant image is now on the right.
"Dorsol," "Plants," and "for" align on the left. 
"Dorsol" and "Seattle" align on the right.
"Plants" and "City Council" align on the right. 

I think it is more pleasing visually and the word "Plants" predominates.

Thanks a lot!

		<div class="commentbody">1. I don't think upper and lower case works with the names stacked, because the top name is teetering, especially in the flush left treatment. Even if you had a really tall "t" (as in Franklin Gothic), that would still just leave a hole as the focus. It's unfortunate that the name has these letters, but you may have to find some other way to impart friendliness, other than U&lc.

2. Are the roots really necessary? It suggests something to do with gardening/botany. In fact, what is that plant? Let's hope it's not a weed.

3. Green color may be overdoing the conceit, with overtones of "green" that may not represent the candidate's platform.

1. I do think upper and lowercase looks more friendly and less pretentious than caps or small caps. But I will try a variation and see how it looks.

2. I did start with the plant image without roots and it was okay, but I felt the plant looked a bit chopped off. I liked a reason to use a dark area at the bottom, it looked more solid.

In fact, the roots do symbolize the candidate's grassroots background as a community organizer. 

I did not use a flowering plant because that may be too "girly". Will it just look like a weed to the public? I hope not, I don't know, which is why I'm asking around. 


3. The candidate expressed his preference for green before I even began, so I think that is okay. So many campaign signs are red-white-and blue that this may help distinguish him, as well.   </div>

Does it work with the first name in lower case? I think so. That prevents a too blocky shape of the text.

The LA in PLANTS created a bit of a "hole" but I set the two letters as closely as I could. 

How about the long descender in "City" trailing off the edge?

And the slighly curved "horizon line"?

		<div class="commentbody">I think the two plants is neat, because it so very literally interprets the name as a noun rebus. Otherwise the reader gets to think too much about why and what Dorsal is planting. The wavy line softens up the all-caps name. I prefer the centred layout, however, and the fact that Plants is bigger in lower case--it's important to have the name big in small signs. If you were to tuck "Elect" into the space between D and l, make Plants a bit taller (condensed), and put some space between L and A -- the overlap is too designy and looks like a mistake.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I much prefer the latest version. The curved horizon lends to the depiction of being soil for the plants and also softens the entire piece, making it more inviting. I think the left layout is a bit cleaner than the centered, but it could go either way and still be successful. I especially appreciate the adding of the second plant, it ties the graphic back to the candidate without requiring the viewer to have to spend additional time forcing the connection.

I would actually think about cutting "elect" all together. It doesn't add to the message and just becomes one more element in the logo. If you're worried about if people are going to know to elect Mr. Plants, then I think you can still get that message without it. Then again, some people do need a little more direction than others. If you do want to keep it, I would disagree with Nick's suggestion of placement just based on the hierarchy. I would look at moving Dorsol to the right, and fitting Elect to the left of it in the darker green. The only other thing that bothers me is the City descender bleeding.</div>

I think either of these could work, although the comparison here indicates the uc-lc "Plants" is easier to read at a glance. The new layout might improve it. 

"ELECT" may not be necessary, although when directed to the general public, you can never assume anything is obvious.

I changed the bleeding y in "City" and shortened the descender slightly.

I did move the L and A apart and condense the word "PLANTS" as Nick suggested.

		<div class="commentbody">What about introducing a deep green as a solid, bleeding background color, knocking out the type and countering the background green with other greens for the plants?

While this is a refreshing departure from most political logos I keep staring at it and see more of a "For Sale" sign, or a lawn care sign than a political yard sign.  Perhaps balancing the friendly and happy face chosen for the name with a more serious sans for "elect" and "for Seattle City Council" would tell the viewer that Dorsol knows that city council is a serious responsibility and that he can be trusted. 

Or you could set everything in Gotham. :)

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Typography Shop, hmm, this is interesting and shows how very subjective a graphic can be.

"For Sale" - well, the it's true the candidate is selling himself to the public, so it has to be noticeable, firstly. The plants image shouldn't be overdone, it's true. Just enough for people to remember the name. 

I could try reversing the type on a dark background as you suggest. 

I don't see the Brueghel font OR the Raleigh font as "friendly and happy." To me, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/grilled-cheese-btn/">Grilled Cheese</a> is friendly and happy! I see Brueghel and Raleigh as strong and solid, yet pleasantly distinctive. 

I looked for fonts that had somewhat organic, thick and thin variations in the letterforms, rather than slick and geometric - to harmonize with the plant image. 

I did first try several utiltarian sans for the subtext, and to me they just didn't seem to go as well with Brueghel.

I loved the Obama campaign but I don't want to copy it. I guess you're kidding about Gotham!

While I agree that the "lawn care" criticism is valid, I would say that in this day and age, and for your candidate's circumstances (especially if going up against an incumbent) your rebus gimmick has way more pros than cons, and the understated manner in which you have handled it demonstrates seriousness.</div>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dorsolplants2009-logo-5i-ln_5848.gif]
I changed to a similar weight font with curvier, more organic serifs (especially the S). I added the top serif on the A to better fill the space next the the L.

I decided the 2 plants looked much better in sequence, rather than overlapped, and with fewer leaves. Now they are more like a border on the right side of the image. 

Thanks to all for the help. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have to say that I really don't like this latest version. The combination of the greens and the separation of the two plants kind of kills the overall design for me. Now, it's possible that my screen is washing out the color a bit, but if this was to presented on a green lawn, even with the white negative space, it may run the risk of being dismissed through color association. That's not to say that the choice in greens is bad, in other settings it could stand out from the crowd of red, blues and whites, then again, it may get over-powered by their stark contrast. For some reason, I was thinking you were going to use richer greens. I liked the overlapping plants, and think even in greyscale, they came across much clearer than the current version. The current version seems like it's going back to the same issues that were in the original version, only this time the plants don't have an obvious starting point as with the roots. They sort of make a backwards "S" as one continuous plant. It also leaves me wondering if the bottom plant is trying to offer some sort of depth of field. Because the bottom plant is vertical, and ends (or begins) at a lower point than the established visual ending  that was developed by the horizontal plane that "City Council" created by running in parallel with the dark green area ("soil"), this makes the eye think there is more to come. I can't remember the name of the term, but you want to keep your outer elements herding the eye back into the design, not away from it.

This is just my opinion, so please don't take offense. I apologize for that really long sentence towards the end..</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ha! I wondered when someone would say: 
"Well now it sucks, it was better before".

I don't take offense! Put several designers in a room together and you can get artistic differences of opinion on almost everything. 

I value different perspectives. it makes me explain WHY I made certain choices.
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

In response to your comments:

1. Color
For some reason the greens do look light here. The dark green should be deeper. 

I thought about the issue of the green sign blending into a green Seattle lawn or hillside, but I think it has enough white to stand out. Besides, with the name "Plants" how could it be anything BUT green? In the summer a lot of the grass turns yellow or brown, anyway. And it'll stand out on a button, since few people wear green clothing, or on a bumper sticker.  

On the website, I'm using shades of brown along with greens for a pleasantly earthy look, with a few accents of blue on things I want to focus on (like the "DONATE" link!).

2. Plant images: The previous overlapping plant images really bothered me, as that seemed to blur and confuse the strong plant shape. Obviously this is subjective, since you think the opposite. But I have showed it to others.

I'm not trying to create realistic depth of field, as the plants are the same size. That makes them iconic rather than illustrative (to me). 

I tried using a larger plant below, but (to me) the more realistic perspective was actually distracting and put the focus on the plants, not the name. 

I think the fact that the lower plant ends above the margin keeps it from leading the eye off the page. But maybe it could be MORE above the margin. I'll try that. 

The way I see it, "Dorsol Plants" is the first focus, then below that "Seattle City Council," then right to the lower plant leading directly UP to the top plant, which points back to Dorsol Plants. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If several more people say they don't care for this layout, I MIGHT rethink it. On the other hand, the average person is not a designer.

I have to remind myself of this when I see passionate Typophile disagreements over the angle of an upper serif or a descender terminal ("The 'y' looks all wrong!") To most people, all Roman fonts are Times. All sans fonts are Arial. The only fonts they recognize as pleasantly novel are Comic Sans or Papyrus or a script. 

So I have to ask a number of regular folks to comment as well.

		<div class="commentbody">I too preferred the overlapping plants, they would make a nice enamelled lapel pin like that, or look good as the sole image on a button. Kinda stealth, eh? Thing is, a rebus is a symbol, not a decorative element.

But I think other than the rebus, the type and layout look great, very strong and direct.
The two-tone effect is a bit pale at the moment--you could actually go very dark with the darker green, and spec some interesting inks, perhaps with a bit of fluorescence for the brighter green.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What about nudging the top plant a little to the left, closer to plants. With the stacking, it has the effect of a two-tone singular plant, which was what I meant by going back to the issues of the original. I liked the tie into his name, but the connection is diminished with only a single plant. If his name was Dorsol Plant, then it would tie in better. I hadn't considered the aspect of a pin, and what Nick was saying does present some interesting thoughts. I understand the depth of field, and your point about illustrative, however because the two plants are the same shade, they no longer create that depth. Because you know there are two plants, you'll see two plants. Also, I got the depth of field, but it came as question, and not intuitive. Going with a deeper green would offer better separation. This could then be used in other media to help reenforce the name recognition (i.e. pin with the two plants with "for Seattle City Council" in the same fashion underneath).

I see you point about the overlapping plants taking the forefront of the stage. It also has a higher degree of contrast in greyscale. Try it with the latest color scheme, does it have the same upstaging effect?

I forgot to mention the version with the Elect. I agree, some people in the general public do need a little more of a push, so if you want to incorporate the elect, you may want to look at a condensed version, but at the same height as Dorsol.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments. 

Here I've tried some of imavery's suggestions to make it clear the image is two separate plants.

As for the button layout, that is always a challenge because it's round. And it's small, yet needs to be legible at a distance that the reader won't have to invade your personal space. I imagine the button could look like these:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dorsolplants2009-2buttns_4249.gif]

Nick's suggestion of a button that just has the plants image, instead of the name is clever; I suspect the voting public isn't as clever. At least not until my candidate's logo is as well-known as Obama's. 

By the way, I was thinking of <a href="http://www.petergoldmark.com/index.php"><strong>Peter Goldmark's</strong</a> button, here in WA state. The logo was fine, but it was simply shrunk down to button size from the sign graphic. 

The line "For OUR Public Lands Commissioner *D" was about 8 point Roman type, white on lime green--all but invisible. Luckily, Goldmark won in spite of that.

For the button, you could probably get away with just Plants for Seattle City Council or Vote Plants for Seattle City Council. The white button would be cheaper to produce, but both look esthetically pleasing. My only suggestion, because I just haven't given enough yet, would be to move the top plant to mirror the bottom plant, but on the left of the button.

Peter Goldmark's logo looks like a logging company logo to me. I can't really read the smaller text, but at that size it could easily be a long-winded "Since The Continents Formed" type of deal.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">imavery, I think your idea of one plant on the left would be really attractive on the button, I'll try it.

I see the Goldmark logo as a woodtype goldrush-era look. That's perfect because he is portrayed as having a rustic cowboy-with-big-mustache persona, a steward of the land, he's even ridden up to some events on his horse.

The microscopic type underneath though, is a dumb mistake by the graphic designer. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas,
Thanks. That layout is interesting, turning the 't' into a shorter character. I did prefer the upper-lower case, rather than all-caps, originally because it looks less pretentious.

This layout looks kinda dense though, and I'm thinking it would be less legible at a glance (for the general public and their easy distractibility). I'd prefer it for a book jacket or something artistic.</div>
