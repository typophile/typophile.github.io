body: "I do have to say that I quite like FontStruct--- three basic fonts done and
  ideas for more keep popping into my head. It does rather seem the fontish equivalent
  of those old record-your-own-record booths which were so prominent in the 50s and
  60s. If anything, it's made me more acutely aware of the talent, skills, and abilities
  of the true font designers, and ashamed of my own inability. \r\n\r\nProps to the
  folks over at FontShop for giving us rank amateurs a chance to shine, even if most
  of us do not!"
