    clever by half. Making the acute accent of Lib\xE9ral serve double-duty as the
    stem of a maple leaf gives an unfortunate sense of motion, as if the leaf is about
    to blow away in the wind like Michael Ignatieff\u2019s political career."

    pleasing, however I do agree with the sense of movement within it.  \r\nAlso,
    I think it is about time the conservatives change their logo, it's quite bland
    (or conservative (sorry for the pun)) compared to the rest minus NDP."

  body: "Nick: <em>a merger of the Liberals and NDP</em>\r\n\r\nBoth unlikely and
    unwelcome, I think. The mainstream press in Canada is busy trying to paint the
    election outcome in terms of Conservatives and NDP moving towards the centre,
    squeezing out the Liberals. But the NDP moved towards the centre a long time ago,
    and it made no difference to their political fortunes prior to this election.
    Harper's Conservatives were found in contempt of parliament for failing to disclose
    spending to enable the state to lock up more Canadians and conduct air strikes
    on more foreigners, hardly centrist policies. Everyone I've talked to since the
    election thinks Canada has taken a step towards much greater polarity, and the
    Liberals got slaughtered at the polls not because the Conservatives and NDP had
    moved onto the centrist turf but because the centre has been evacuated by the
    electorate. I don't get any sense that people who oppose the Conservative policies
    for the country want the NDP to be centrists taking over Liberal positions. I
    heard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONWn6hfd7Uk\">Tommy Douglas</a>\u2019
    name mentioned more times during this campaign than in any recent election. I
    suspect a great many people who voted NDP in this election are already somewhere
    to the left of the party, especially in Quebec and out here.\r\n\r\nBut you're
    right about the Canadia/en Airlines logo. :)"

  body: "I could see Justin Trudeau leading a resurgent Liberal party in the next
    election. If, however, there were a merger of the Liberal party with the NDP under
    present circumstances, the result would be led by Jack Layton - for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThen,
    after Justin Trudeau's term as Liberal leader ends - perhaps after only a few
    years if the resurgent Liberals fail to defeat Harper, the race will perhaps be
    between Bob Rae and Belinda Stronach - whoever wins, Liberal fortunes will decline
    again (even if not quite so precipitously), and so there will be another Liberal
    leadership convention.\r\n\r\nIf the Liberals utterly fail to regain ground in
    Quebec under Justin Trudeau - or whoever their next leader may be - then being
    subsumed into the NDP is possible. But I would not bet money on that."
