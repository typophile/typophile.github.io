body: "Creating a mark for a fine art exhibit that will also be used on a book cover
  for the exhibit. Very challenging execution, and I know it needs some refining.
  Thought this was the best place to take it for some feedback. I am using Trajan
  for the first and last letters, then Helvetica Neue Thin for the middle C. Obviously
  the rest of the letters are modified. That's the tricky part, and why this is the
  best place to show it for a critique.\r\n\r\nBTW I am a publication designer, so
  if someone could tell me how to paste the file into the post that would be great
  for future ref."

  body: "I think the slimmed down serif characters are a bit problematic. But that
    might also have to do with the fact I don't like Trajan.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you
    mean by pasting the file into the post? As an image, or as PDF attachment? For
    image in the post just click the 'Insert image' below the typing-field. To add

  body: "My sense about exhibits and catalogs is that you should keep the typography
    kind of appropriate and low volume (not loud).\r\n\r\nI'm already wondering what
    the wall texts and book will be set in. I don't see so many marks used to represent
    shows. I might reconsider a more straight forward approach. "

  body: "They wanted a mark because it is going to have multimedia commercial viability.\r\n\r\nThis
    was my first draw in Trajan. I chose it because the subject matter deals with
    New Testament themes, and how they relate to our modern world. I am thinking however
    of redrawing with Requiem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething beautiful and something
    ugly almost always works."

  body: "I like the idea of the typeface changing, but I'm not sure that it's working
    too well with the combination of those particular two. I think maybe because one
    is serif the other sans serif...\r\nPerhaps you could try a similiar concept but
    using colour instead? i.e. darker colour on the outer letters gradually fading
    to a lighter at the centre letter 'C'?\r\nJust a suggestion :)"

  body: "Letter changes are fine as long as they change in one axis only. You're doing
    it on two: weight and serifs. Decide which one to actually change and then choose
    a family that has all of those. Not so many around to scale serif axis. You could
    do some interpolation to limited results though.\r\n\r\nWeight axes changes are
    more common. And it's also more obvious. Serif changes maybe won't be as visible
    to majority of people."
