body: I&#39;m doing titles for a film set in World War I. Are there any good typefaces
  that approximate plane signage from the period? &#40;Blackletter/gothic ones?&#41;
  Thanks.

    <BR> <BR>However, I can think of a couple of typefaces for you to spec. <BR> <BR>First
    off is Fette Fraktur, from Linotype. Fette Fraktur is a &#34;typical&#34; victorian-era
    fraktur. Such typefaces were still in wide-spread use throughout Germany during
    the first World War. <BR> <BR>Second should be akzidenz grotesk. This can be bought
    through Berthold or Adobe, at least. This is not a blackletter face, but it was
    used throughout Germany at the time. <BR> <BR>Lastly, I would consider almost
    any typeface designed by Rudolf Koch. Most of his typefaces were designed after
    the first world war, but I would guess that this anacronysm could be forgiven.
    Koch also fought in the first world war &#40;as did most other famous german designers
    from that time&#41;.

    <BR>Rudolf Koch did wilhelm klingspor gotisch &#40;post WWI&#41; amongst others

    <BR>I also came across this rather interesting blackletter stencil which you could
    develop maybe? Although the sans serifs were available and widely used would an
    audience be aware of that? <BR>Tim

  body: 'Chris, please don`t use Fraktur or Blackletter for titling. And please don`t
    use Kochs types. Koch was a very brave man, made his types for the holy word -
    so it would work for films like Luther. But if you want extend the clichee of
    the ugly German - Fette Fraktur &amp; Co. will do this job. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>In
    this time Fraktur was not so popular &#40;especially for scientific things and
    advertising&#41;- it became more popular in contrast to Bauhaus and Futura later.
    <BR> <BR>fonts match the timeline: <BR> <BR>- De Vinne Latin  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/</a> <BR> <BR>-  Clarendon
    <BR><a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?2SA" target="_blank">http://www.identifont.com/show?2SA</a>
    <BR> <BR>- Akzidenz Grotesk, right <BR> <BR>You will find the above types in pre
    WWI Berthold specimens. <BR> <BR>Also Ehmcke Antiqua - now marked as Carlton matches
    the time &#40;published by Flinsch Foundry 1908 and very common till WWI for titlings&#41;
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/carlton/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/carlton/</a>
    <BR> <BR>- some bold oldstyle Egyptienne, Grotesk or Antiqua designs with the
    typical flavor of this time work too, but I miss the right ones in the digital
    age. <BR> <BR>for plane signatures only, catch some historical sources of the
    german planes. <BR> <BR>Search for MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN / RED BARON or FOKKER.
    <BR> <BR>BTW: I think the iron cross was used only - no types.'

  body: 'I think that blackletters, even frakturs, are beautiful. I find it disparaging,
    as an American living in Germany, when Germans tell me that these letters are
    ugly and evil. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Tim might be right. If these planes didn&#39;t
    emply blackletter type on them, then you shouldn&#39;t use it in your film. That
    <i>would</i> perpetuate a false stereotype. Since this is a documentary, you should
    show the truth &#40;whatever that is!&#41;. '

  body: 'Actually I found a picture of a german biplane &#40;Pfalz D-XII&#41; that
    did employ the stencil blackletter  and a 5 colour lozenge camouflage scheme.
    The markings seem to usually involve the maltese cross and/or a black cross of
    equal leg lengths with white outline, squadron markings and camouflage &#40;although
    there were some personalised colour schemes '
