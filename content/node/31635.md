  me some help. I am wanting to base my final year graphic design research assignment
  on letterpress typography. I don't really know where to start but I need to identifiy
  a problem or an aspect of letterpress that I can turn into a contemporary design
  project. Are there any issues that any of you can think of?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nB"

    they''ll probably be able to talk to you about commercial stuff. '

      I have been there but most of the guys there dont really look at letterpress
      typography as anything more than a tool to print newspapers and publications
      etc. I was wanting to possibly combine media which could make for an interesting
      investigation, but I would have to find a good topic to test it out to make
      it something that is commercially viable. '

    your friends think it would be cool.\r\n2) Places like Paper Source are not serious.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
