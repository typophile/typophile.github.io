  body: It's more important to have a web site, but I will sometimes send around pdf
    updates by email showing recent projects and reminding clients (or potential clients)
    that I exist.

  body: "Wow. I'm really surprised this is so ill received. Before everyone knocks
    portfolio by email let's consider a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Is your final product
    typically in a digital medium? If so, a pdf should be <em>more than</em> suitable.\r\n2.
    You have MORE limitations with a web site than a pdf. \r\n3. Your work should
    speak for itself. You shouldn't need to be there, in person, to explain anything.\r\n\r\nI
    can give even more concrete reasons to back myself up if the discussion turns
    to disagreement. Of course, (for example) if you're applying to cut blocks for
    a printing press, a pdf might not be suitable medium for your portfolio. However,
    it's 2008, so I can't imagine you're going to get too many interviews without
    at least a small digital showing first. \r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear the
    reasoning behind the \"NO!'s\" posted before this."

  body: "<em>2. You have MORE limitations with a web site than a pdf.</em>\r\nI'd
    have to disagree, I don't see how the web is more limiting at all really.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI
    am also in the 'no' camp; unless the job posting or person has specifically asked
    for an attached PDF. Some companies will block all incoming attachments, and it's
    possible you PDF won't make it through to begin with. It's also a bit inconsiderate
    to the person your sending it to, to expect them to download and load your attachment
    in their mail program when they probably have more important emails to view and
    respond to throughout the day. I, for one would get annoyed with being spammed
    with unsolicited emails with attachments at work unless there was a reason, like
    an actual job posting. \r\n\r\nI take exception to the rule in cases like pattyfab's,
    where she's updating clients.\r\n\r\nLinks to where they can download a PDF or
    a link to your website with the option to download a PDF is more polite alternative
    in my opinion. "

  body: It really depends on the situation. I don't think there are rules, and most
    email servers won't block small attachments. When I'm soliciting a new client
    I will send them a link to my web site but may also attach a pdf resume and one
    page showing some books I've designed, just to give them an idea. If they don't
    have the time or inclination to open the pdf - well I can't control that. But
    to me it's the digital equivalent of mailing a tear sheet. I wonder how many people
    actually download the pdfs on web sites - I know I rarely do.

    facsimile as a PDF might suffice, but hardly the best option.\r\n\r\n\"2. You
    have MORE limitations with a web site than a pdf.\"\r\n\r\nDisagree. Not even
    sure where to begin with that one.\r\n\r\n\"3. Your work should speak for itself.
    You shouldn\u2019t need to be there, in person, to explain anything.\"\r\n\r\nVery
    true. But the issue has more to do with people annoyingly clogging my in-box than
    whether or not it's an in-person portfolio review.\r\n\r\nI'm not against PDFs,
    of course. In fact, my current portfolio is in PDF format. \r\n\"I wonder how
    many people actually download the pdfs on web sites - I know I rarely do.\"\r\n\r\nWhether
    you attach the PDF or just link to it directly from your site, it accomplishes
    the exact same thing...except the latter won't clog the end-user's in-box."

    are applying for a job\r\nas print designer, i wouldn't do it. I would\r\nexpect
    something a bit more exciting than\r\na pdf. (as in format, folding, finishing
    etc.)\r\n\r\nas a webdesigner? yes, as most of your\r\nwork is done online anyway,
    and people\r\nwant to see an actual live website you\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nYes
    it is 2008 and you should be able\r\nto sent a pdf, but as mentioned before\r\npeople
    are getting so many emails these\r\ndays that they cant be asked to have a \r\nlook
    at every email.\r\n\r\nI think if you want to stand out and\r\nmake a bit of an
    impact it would be\r\nbetter to drop off a printed version\r\nof your portfolio.\r\n\r\nmy

  body: "I would have to agree with all of those who said that the best way is to
    have a link to a site were a pdf can be downloaded. You can even include a small
    image in your mail as a teaser! It's more polite, than forcing people to download
    your archives. I know some graphic designers here in Portugal that may look at
    your web page but won't download your file.\r\n\r\nI don't totally disagree with
    sending a pdf, but in that case keep it a small sized file, so that you don't
    cause too much inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe printed version was really the best way
    to go if it wasn't for the printing costs... perhaps if you can get a interview
    with the companies... you could go there and showcase  them your portfolio (this
    way you only have to print one). If they ask to keep it for a review you can then
    allays give them you web address!"

    browsing through compact images when I am getting an overview of a person''s work.
    However, I wouldn''t hire for print without having access to either a pdf press
    capable or printed sample, you can loose too much stuff among the dots of a raster
    imaged file. '

  body: In my first year of school I responded to some ad for a design competition,
    with something like 10 huge .JPGs attached. Even better, I crashed the guy's email,
    and he lost everything! I would suggest not doing that, unless you want to piss
    someone off.

    layouts across, I recommend www.issuu.com. Im a bit partial, since i know the
    guys making that site, but i find it really useful for communicating portfolios
    on the web. It's pdf based, and really easy to use. You just upload your pdf,
    and get a delicious online browser to show off and link to.\r\n\r\nSorry if i
    broke a forum rule, advertising like this. It certainly wasn't my intention."

  body: "I've had a lot of people request digital portfolios, via email or otherwise.
    Although, usually, they're for in-house design departments in smaller areas. So
    we're not talking the most modern of modern.\r\n\r\nMy problem with a website
    is, being a graphic designer that does pretty much exclusively print, a website
    is not my medium of choice. I'm not terribly good at website design and tend to
    not go for jobs that require it so I'm not advancing my skills. Also the further
    and further I get away from college the less I know about it. So something like
    coroflot, like Darrel mentioned is nice for me. \r\n\r\nEric that seems to be
    pretty nice too. I'm definitely going to look into that further."
