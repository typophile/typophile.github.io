  body: "It is a Bauhaus-style font, in my terminology, because it uses the geometric
    simplified letterforms. The House Chalet collection includes a good mix of Bauhaus-style
    fonts, and by mixing and matching, maybe with an e-edit, you could replicate this.
    You might even be able to make this from Avant Garde Gothic, inverting the u to
    make the n.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I take part of that back. The u in Avant Garde has a stem, so if you have
    to remove a stem, take it from the n. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
