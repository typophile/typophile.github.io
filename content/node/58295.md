  Currently, the font combination used is Times New Roman italic for participant titles
  and institutions (smaller type), while the name is in a larger Verdana bold. (Name
  legibility is the most important feature. Does anyone have any other classic font
  combinations that would be compatible with standard PC fonts? (It has to be standard
  PC fonts because the computers used are basic rentals every year, in a different
  city, and the template has to be accessible by all conference employees. It\u2019s
  very limiting, but any suggestions would be helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    PC (and <em>Baskerville</em> with OSX and Office 04 on a Mac). Perhaps matching
    it with <em>Franklin Gothic Medium</em> (Windows, Office 03 Win, Office 07 Win)
    could work? <em>FG</em> wouldn't be available on a Mac, but Office 04 has News
    Gothic which is very similar. \r\n\r\nI have more suggestions, but as long as
    I don't know anything about the conference it's hard to know what might be suitable."

  body: Btw, the bundled version of Baskerville Old Face does not have a true italic.
    Neither does Franklin Gothic.

  body: "thanks...btw, i posted this on another forum, but here is a repost with more
    details:\r\n\r\nHere are a couple versions of what I\u2019m talking about:\r\n\r\n\u2014the
    original badge is the all-centered version with Times New Roman italics and the
    bold, larger name in Verdana.\r\n\r\n\u2014the left-justified version has been
    converted to a standard windows vista (i think) sans serif (in this case, Franklin
    Gothic\u2014which does not match the interstate font used in logo, but just looks
    nicer than, say, arial). the logo has been reduced a bit, as it\u2019s not necessary
    to have such a large logo on the badge. i think the left-justified version in
    all sans is easier to read.\r\n\r\nby the way, the original file generator is
    a microsoft word badge insert template (3\u201D x 4\u201D badges). all the info
    is pulled from a general master list created in excel, through word\u2019s data
    merge manager. this is the only efficient way to prepare the badges as participant
    lists are not finalized until perhaps the day before, and new badges have to be
    created on the spot by anyone on staff (thus, microsoft word, windows platform...)\r\n\r\nthe
    smaller type is 16 pt; the bold names are 22 pt.\r\n\r\nthe blue/color bar at
    the bottom of the badge is just an indicator of what level participant one is...it
    needs to be there for security/identification reasons.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?
    i\u2019m now looking for a standard windows sans serif font that will match the
    logo font, which is interstate light. ideas? thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Name-badge-sample-2009-pg-1_5065.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Name-badge-sample-2009-left-just-pg-1_5120.gif]"
