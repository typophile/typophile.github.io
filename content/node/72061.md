  body: Hmm. Sounds strange. I have never seen idotacute in Lithuanian. It's not in
    Everson's list either [[http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/lithuanian.pdf]]

  body: I just asked a Lithuanian friend if the character in question was ever used
    in Lithuanian, and she said 'no'. I guess it's a bug then.

  body: According to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic|Wikipedia]], Lithuanian
    uses the acute, grave and tilde in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the
    language's pitch accent system. If the accent is not part of the normal orthography
    but is a secondary mark, one could see how the i would retain the dot. This is
    conjecture, of course. Do you spot dottedigrave and dotteditilde as well?

  body: "Convention in dictionaries, grammars, etymologies etc. -- \"i\" and \"iogonek\"
    when tone-marked preserve their dots -- sometimes not followed for obvious reason.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"i with dot and acute\" is also present in Verdana, Georgia and Comic Sans. No
    other necessary glyphs are present, though. At least not in versions installed
    on my system."

  body: I can't find Latin small letter i with dot and acute in the latest Unicode
    list either. One UC "information site" claimed its code to be U+E37E, which is
    clearly nonsense.

    seen some type designers include it, but I\u2019ve never once seen, or heard of,
    it used in Norwegian (or any other language for that matter)."

  body: "Theunis: not such a char in Unicode. In practice, one uses either a direct
    sub \"iacute\" --> \"idotacute\" or a composition \"i\" + \"dotcomb\" + \"acutecomb\"
    if we count only good solutions. <em>The Unicode Standard. Versio 5.2</em> reads:\r\n\r\n<em>In
    Lithuanian typography for dictionary use, an \u201Ci\u201D retains its dot when
    a grave, acute, or tilde accent is placed above it. This convention is represented
    in Unicode by using an explicit combining dot above, occurring in sequence between
    the \u201Ci\u201D and the respective\r\naccent. (See Figure 7-2.) When case folded
    using the default case folding algorithm, strings containing these sequences will
    still contain the combining dot above. In the unusual situation where case folding
    needs to be tailored to provide for these special Lithuanian dictionary requirements,
    strings can be preprocessed to remove any combining dot above characters occurring
    between an \u201Ci\u201D and a subsequent accent, so that the folded strings will
    match correctly.</em>\r\n\r\nFrode: I guess so. The only time I saw that char,
    was in some transcription(s) (also, \"uringacute\" and other comb.). It's not
    even in MUFI 3.0."

  body: So the mystery left would be why dottedigrave and dotteditilde are not contained
    in those fonts as well.

  body: A/a ring acute is used in the translitteration of Icelandic to Danish - so
    rather pointless to include it in fonts unless those are for scholarly or dictionary
    use.
