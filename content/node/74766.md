body: "Hello guys, this is a display font i've been working on for some time. I' am
  now getting close to finish. Its a two weight family with regular and italic (more
  cursive perhaps). This a sample of the regular weight.\r\n\r\nit will be a somehow
  playful font with a fair range of ligatures and ornaments, and a set of ornamental
  figures.\r\nIt's called Aria in reference to its musical mood.\r\n\r\nCould guys
  tell me what you think? Anything you would fix or change. Any thought please.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aria_2_6329.jpg]"

    don't seem to fit. Too sharp, and perhaps too large. "

    with the flavor of the interior of the \"3\" and \"5\" swash numeral. I prefer
    this to the interior of the \"6\" (seems rounder)\r\n\r\ngo! ;)\r\na,"

  body: "Very nice - I particularly like the 'flowing' feel to the italics.\r\n\r\nOne
    comment on the name - while I like it, it's already in use by a very different
    free font, although the name is much more appropriate for yours. A little googling
    found that Arioso is a well-known font, but Ariose seems to be available.\r\n\r\n-

    'flowing' feel on the italics, that is actually something I'm trying to achieve.
    I think I will call it Cursive instead of Italic.\r\nIt turned into quite a separate
    font, I guess. The letters are a bit more calligraphic, the angle is very different,
    and the barbs and some serifs turned into more organic terminations. Here goes
    an example of the \"G\".[img:sites/default/files/old-images/G_3951.jpg]"

  body: BTW, how can you design without spacing? For me, it would be impossible, at
    least to some degree, to define the form widths in harmony, without testing space
    at the same time.

    Do you plan to make alternative \"Q\" (with long tail)?\r\nIn one word: gracious

  body: "Claudio, I will some day start a text version for this, but I'm not planning
    on starting that endeavor right away. I guess it's good to start with a more exuberant
    cut like this and them tame it down to a text face.\r\n\r\nI also think it's a
    bit impossible to design the letters without working on spacing too. Roughly,
    the spacing I have here is the result of the designing of the Leters and balancing
    with the negative space.. But I'll go over it again of course.\r\n\r\nBen, I wasn't
    thinking of those swashes, but I guess it could be an idea. It Would match the
    alternative J. But I'm not planning on making lot's of swashes :)\r\n\r\nJan,
    Thanks for the input. Maybe the B has a bit of flaccid belly, I have to look into
    that. On the ornamented six, I was planning to use the spiral on the upper part,
    maybe it will work better.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, there will be a long tail Q, of course.
    :)"
