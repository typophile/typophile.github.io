body: that is the question... <BR> <BR>I prefer &#34;off&#34; because 95% of PC users
  will see my design work without smoothing, simply because the anti-aliasing function
  switch is hard to find, most people don&#39;t even know it exists...

  body: for TrueType for PCs the original Microsoft recomendation for font developers
    was to use the &#39;gasp&#39; table to control when the font smoothing works,
    and to enable smoothing when the stems are two pixels and greater. This avoids
    thin strokes becoming too light in most instances.  <BR> <BR>Most TT_hinters hint
    for binary/nonsmoothed display and check what the font looks like when smoothed
    and fix it there with conditional instructions added to alter the greyscale/smoothed
    display.  <BR> <BR>I use ClearType on my home LCD PC and Laptops at home and binary
    on my desktop PC at work.
