  body: Very nice! The type nerd in me would have preferred something other than Helvetica,
    but it doesn't work badly at all as it is now.

  body: I might suggest "Onward" going in a different direction than "Upward", but
    i like it overall.

  body: "I mostly chose helvetica because its a bit of a running joke at my school,
    (im the one person who enjoyed the movie helvetica) and the straights and curves
    of helvetica work well with the straights and curves of the two arrows. \r\nThanks
    much for your comments!"
