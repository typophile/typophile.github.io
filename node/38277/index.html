We&rsquo;re putting together an identity for a public figure, and he was born in 1949, and it would be a nice touch. I was hoping one of Zapfs faces would have come out then, or at least been started during &lsquo;49, but it looks like a dead period between palatinio and optima.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many factories (Monotype UK, D. Stempel AG Germany, etc.) were converted over to war industry production for a time. Many older type designers stayed in their posts during the war. Younger ones, like Zapf, were drafted, although his lettering skills lead to his being assigned to a cartography office in occupied France. Some other designers were not as lucky; Klingspor&rsquo;s Rudo Spemann died in action. And Vojtěch Preissig was interned in the concentration camp at Dachau, where he died.</p>
<p>By 1949, many English and German foundries (select foundries in both countries were bombed) seem to have back in business, at least that is what their period promotional materials seem to suggest.</p>
