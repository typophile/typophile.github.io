  body: "Sorry for the late response. I have been travelling.\r\n\r\nI don't really
    understand what it is that you want to do with the 'Alef G' example. This looks
    like a re-ordering operation, which is not something that OTL is designed to do.
    Also, OTL is applied to glyph runs that are typically demarcated by script boundaries,
    so trying to affect substitutions involving Hebrew and Latin glyphs is unlikely
    to work.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with the number substitution you will run into the
    problem of glyph runs being demarcated by directionality, so the RTL Hebrew letters
    will be processed separately from the LTR numerals. If this worked in CS3, I'm
    not sure how."

  body: "Was the Hebrew font a non-Unicode .ttf?\r\n\r\nID CS3 ME handled non-Unicode
    .ttf Hebrew differently than in CS5 or later.\r\n\r\nTo get around the limitation
    John referred to, there must be a space on each side of the Hebrew string. As
    a type creator, make this space a zero width in order to place the non-Hebrew
    G besides the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nJohn, I made work-arounds back in the nineties when
    there was no ID CS/3 ME or higher, just Quark 2.x US edition. :)"
