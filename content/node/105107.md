  body: "Thanks for the replies!\r\n\r\nRenko, I've tried the Peignot by Cassandre
    but it seems to be more compact than the original font. Is there another version
    of this font? Or something I can do to change the distance between each letter? "

    I could change the letter spacing in there. Is this how you'd go about changing
    it yourself?"
