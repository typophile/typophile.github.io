  Fabian De Lange's typeface Eclectic, my only problem with it is that I am having
  quite a bit of trouble pairing it with a serif and a san serif for body and title
  copy, I've copied some links to show Eclectic. I am open to any suggestions! Thanks
  so much guys and have a great one!"

  body: Unless you plan to write very long texts, it would probably be easier to use
    just a sans serif in different weights.
