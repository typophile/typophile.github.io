  body: "Research the companies you might want to work for in the area you want to
    work, once you narrow down your ideal choices, find out the name and address of
    the Creative Director and write to them, making sure you spell the names of all
    concerned correctly, asking to come and show your portfolio. If all goes well,
    broach the subject of work experience or ask if there is anything you could do
    to improve your portfolio, or any other design companies nearby that might be
    able to help. Design Week, Creative Review or the Guardian on Mondays are the
    best places to look for vacancies but there will be precious few for new graduates.\r\nGood
    Luck\r\nTim"
