  mind around. Seems like there are no easy answers for anything when it comes to

    is not a must (but may be what users expect). Microsoft's new ClearType fonts
    however use oldstyle proportional numerals as default.\r\n\r\n<cite>Are there
    set unicodes for glyphs zero.tab through nine.tab and tabular currency?</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    OT fonts you should select one set of numerals as default, name them \"zero\"
    to \"nine\" (no suffix) and assign standard numeral Unicode values.\r\nFor additional
    sets of numerals attach the according suffix to the glyph name, but do not assign
    Unicode values. Substitution is handled by OT features onum, lnum, tnum, pnum.
    There is a very recent thread about this.\r\n\r\n<cite>And how important are the
    unicodes for OT fonts anyway?</cite>\r\n\r\nMost important. :)\r\n\r\n<cite>Won\u2019t
    everything work if I set up my OT classes using glyph names?</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    FontLab Studio, as well as the AFDKO, both classes and OT feature code are defined
    via glyph names."

  body: "Cool... That's what I thought!\r\n\r\nI don't know why or how I would delete
    the unicode for the main glyphs.\r\n\r\nBut glyphs that are subsituted by the
    onum, lnum, tnum, pnum OT features can get by on glyph names alone.\r\n\r\nI can
    deal with that!\r\n\r\nThanks, Karsten."
