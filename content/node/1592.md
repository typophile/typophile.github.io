body: First of all, I&#39;m sorry for the length of this post and its extremely specific
  nature, but I&#39;m hoping some fo you might be able to help. <BR> <BR>While on
  my travels in North America earlier in the month I came across a little keepsafe
  from the &#40;original&#41; STA, entitled &#34;A letter about Eric Gill&#34;. It
  was published in 1950 and written by H D C Pepler &#40;I have posted a photo of
  the cover at <A HREF="http://www.typographer.com/egletter.jpg" TARGET="_top">http://www.typographer.com/egletter.jpg</A>.
  Being a bit of an Eric Gill fan &#40;I blame him entirely for my interest in the
  field&#41;, I quickly bought it for some ludicrously nominal amount. <BR> <BR>Amazingly,
  there was a loose slip of paper in the back that had somehow managed not to get
  lost detailing that there were two versions of it made. One for STA members  bound
  in paste paper by R H Middleton &#40;400 copies&#41; and one for non-members &#40;600
  copies&#41;. Presumably, judging from the cover, its one of the paste paper copies.
  <BR> <BR>Firstly, does anyone have any knowledge about this particular keepsake?
  I&#39;ll happily type up and post the foreword if anyone is interested. <BR> <BR>Secondly,
  how I can protect it from any further damage? I am not a book expert and have no
  experience of looking after this kind of thing, so any advice would be welcome.

    a couple of copies available through abebooks.com.  <BR> <BR>You might try contacting
    James Mosley at the St. Bride Printing Library in London. He may be able to help
    you with both questions. I believe he&#39;s quite a Gill aficionado. <BR> <BR>--

    the collection at St. Bride&#39;s of Gill&#39;s work, I&#39;m sure they can help
    regardless. -- I&#39;m extremely interested for more info. '
