  title of books:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67523/richard-mcgregor/the-party-the-secret-world-of-chinas-communist-rulers\r\n\r\nI
  don't know if something's wrong with my Firfox, but it won't show the true font.
  It shows the font I'm looking after in Chrome and IE8. If you don't have the issue,
  great.\r\n\r\nimage: [[http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/940/fontsample.jpg]]\r\n\r\nI
  looked the page source and couldn't find the answer. I thought it is the Lucida
  Grande, but showed up it isn't. I sent the image to \"WhatTheFont?\" detecting site,
  but didn't get the exact answer. Hope I get my answer here. Note that the letter
  \"a\" is unique.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\nG."
