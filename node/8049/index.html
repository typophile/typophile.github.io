  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, i am a graphic design student in my 3rd and final year, and currently writing my dissertation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My dissertation is on the current trend of hand rendered typography over more traditional typefaces and looking into how well this style communicates.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hear there is an article in raygun composed by mr Carson which has been set entirely in webdings. I have been searching for this article for a long time now, and wonder if anyone could tell me if indeed it does exist, and if so in which edition.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This would be most helpful in one of my chapters on how the motivation of the audience helps in determining the readability of a piece. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any help would be greatfully recieved.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Point of information: while some people, especially native English-speaking typographers it seems, have taken to distinguishing between legibility and readability, this seems an anomaly, both professionally and linguistically. As I discovered when moderating the legibility panel discussion in Thessaloniki this summer, cognitive psychologists studying reading do not generally make a distinction between legibility and readability. If they do make a distinction, it is not the same as that made by typographers. So while we, as typographers, might use 'legibility' to refer to letter decipherment and 'readability' to refer to word recognition, a cognitive psychologist might make no distinction, or might reserve the term readability to refer to document-level phenomena such as page layout, structure and even prose style. Many languages do not offer even a vocabulary distinction for legibility versus readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it would be a good thing for typographers to recognise that the distinction we've taken to making between legibility and readability is really begging the question: the distinction itself assumes that letter decipherment and word recognition are somehow separate and only the latter constitutes reading. No cognitive scientist is going to accept such a loaded distinction, since empirical studies are at best inconclusive and tend, in fact, to link letter recognition and word recognition very closely.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Daniel <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The RayGun artcle you mentioned was at least eight years ago (so Iam not sure how relevant it is to current design trends). It seemed a pretty pointless exercise at the time, speaking as a reader of the magazine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that article in RayGun is probably a good example of why legible type is in no danger of being written off. Ask yourself why was the whole magazine not set in webdings, every month! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because as a consumer you would go up to the magazine stand and say, I am not paying $8 for some pictures and some text which doesn't mean anything, even if it is designed by David Carson.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Design is all about communication, and while a hard to read display font, or piece of hand lettering may be funky for a magazine headline, the body text has to communicate with the reader clearly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd suggest that you research th other side of the arguement, for example&hellip; if distressed looking type is so popular and trendy, why are the classic fonts the most popular (looking at sales figures). Why are companies like Sea Design ( <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.seadesign.co.uk">http://www.seadesign.co.uk</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> ) and Browns ( <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.brownsdesign.co.uk">http://www.brownsdesign.co.uk</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> ) in design magazines every month, and winning all the top awards (in the UK where I see you are) with clean helvetica based work if this isn't popular, and why are newspaper typefaces so conservative if readers love hard to read text? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please keep us posted on your progress, as I am sure lots of us would love to read the finished thing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim <!-- raw HTML omitted -->===</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, the model of word recognition that Kevin Larson describes is one in which word-identity is guessed at in the brain based on all available information and, particularly, the simultaneous identification of the letters in the word. Obviously, if you fragment words by excessive or inconsistent letterspacing, then you break whatever model of word recognition you are working with, but this doesn't imply that the letter-recognition -&gt; word-recognition model is inadequate, because obviously the key to word-recognition would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letters in a word<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you can't easily tell where a word begins or ends, letter recognition isn't going to function as it should as part of word recognition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Studies on the phenomenon of lateral masking on letter recognition are interesting in this regard, because they suggest how letter spacing &ndash; and form &ndash; affect the ability to recognise individual letters. The basic phenomenon is that letters in the parafovea are easier to recognise in isolation than when sandwiched between other letters; the effect of the other letters is called lateral masking. What is interesting is that there is a totally unintuitive improvement in letter recognition when parts of the letters actually touch, which Peter Enneson, for one, thinks may contribute to an understanding of the value of serifs, as elements that make connections between letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the results of the legibility panel in Thessaloniki is that Kevin is now very interested in the matter of letter spacing, and is beginning to test specifically in this area. I've talked with him a little bit about his initial results, but I don't want to steal his thunder so will let him make his findings public when he is ready.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I'm just reporting, as correctly as I'm able, the opposing viewpoint. I'm not concerned with how people make their decisions, but I am concerned that people make assumptions and encode those assumptions into their language. Making a distinction between legibility and readability along the lines we have done so in recent years now seems to me presumptuous. Sure, it may be useful and it may even turn out to be correct, but you can't expect any scientist to accept such an a priori assumption. Science is slow and takes a long time to come to a conclusion. Jumping to conclusions is obviously quicker. When we have to select a typeface for a project and decide whether it is appropriately spaced, we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->must<!-- raw HTML omitted --> jump to a conclusion, based on intuition, experience, etc. But this is a different process from accurately determining how we read. I wouldn't base a decision about typeface use on partial empirical understanding of how we read, but nor would I base a theory of how we read on intuition and anecdotal typographic evidence. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;humans are not algorithmic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This seems to relate to something I said to Peter Enneson in Thessaloniki. The parallel letter recognition model seems to offend some people because it seems algorithmic; certainly, it doesn't seem holistic. And we like to think that we're oh so holistic, because that is how we experience thought. But all evidence of brain activity points to a crude, algorithmic device that gets by on sheer processing power: leaving us with the uncomfortable notion that what we experience as holistic may actually be the product of a massively complex algorithmic machine. The holistic appearance of thought may, in fact, be a function of the complexity. This is to what I was referring in my chess game metaphor at Thessaloniki: the experience of reading differs from the mechanics of reading. This raises all sorts of interesting questions. To what degree is the experience of reading directly addressable via the mechanics of reading? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Imagine, for example, that you changed the rules of chess to insert an element of chance into the game. For instance, the players would flip a coin that would determine which of them would miss his third move. Suddenly, chess would no longer be a function: it would become a game. But since we don't experience chess as a function anyway &ndash; we experience it as a game &ndash;, such mechanical tinkering doesn't significantly affect our experience. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Likewise, it seems to me, that whether one accepts the parallel letter recognition or Hrant's bouma theory of reading &ndash; or produces evidence of some other mechanism &ndash; it isn't obvious that this choice, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or type design practices arising from it,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will significantly affect the experience of reading. And it is this, I think, that Richard Southall was acknowledging. Type designers and typographers are predominantly interested in the experience of reading. So when Richard told Kevin that he would not necessarily adapt his design practices to empirical evidence suggesting that loose letterspacing improved readability, one must also assume that he would not necessarily adapt his design practices to Hrant's recommendations based upon the bouma theory.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;The way the terms legibility and readability are used by many typographers suggests an unproven distinction of kind: that letter recognition and word recognition are separate activities. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, you seem to be assuming that the distinction is based on the extreme view that 'bouma' or word shape is everything, which has been refuted by the examples recently discussed of mixing letters within words.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But your understanding on the usage of these terms I think is not correct, at least historically. For example, here is the distinction as explained in my late Uncle J. Ben Lieberman's book 'Types of Typefaces' (1967): <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*** <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Legibility&quot; is based on the ease with which one letter can be told from another.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[Here follows a graphic with b's and h's, including the old style italic h, which can be confused with a b].  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Readibility&quot; is the ease with which the eye can absorb the message and move along the line. The choice of typeface is not the only thing that determines readibility. The size of the letter, the spacing between letters, the amount of &quot;leading&quot; (spacing) between lines, the width of the line itself, the size of the margins around the type block, the quality of inking, the effect of the process used - including the amound of &quot;sock&quot; [in letterpress] the texture or finish of the paper stock, the color of the paper and ink - all these are involved, both in affecting the appearance of the particular typefaced used and in the resulting readibility. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*** <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should add that Ben Lieberman was in contact with the leading lights of his day in the type world, so this definition almost certainly reflects widespread practice in the type world. So we are talking about usage that probably dates back to at least the 1930s.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This definition does not make any prejudgments about the relative importance and exact role of disciphering individual letters verses whole words. It just says that there is more to readibility than distinguishing quickly individual letters.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, it does seem to me from the discussions here on Typophile - I don't know the literature - that psychological research on these additional factors beyond letter discipherment has been rather neglected.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As irritating as I find Hrant's extreme and insulting way of putting it, I think he has a sound point that a lot of research remains to be done to enlighten us on these additional factors. I do agree with you, and not with Hrant, in thinking that in the end these results are not likely to affect normal typographic practice or speed of comprehension very much.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, I would like to split further readibility as defined by Lieberman. There is one aspect of readibility which is reading speed and comprehension, and another which is comfort. I may be able to read a paragraph on screen as fast and with as much comprehension as a printed version. But it is common knowledge that it is more fatiguing to read low resolution screens, and that if you want to proof read something, you'd better print it out. The degree to which a setting is welcoming and comfortable to read it seems to me is extremely important to typography, beyond legibility or readibility. And it, too, could be studied scientifically.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, thanks for the Lieberman quotes. I had not realised that the typographic distinction between legibility versus readability dates back that far, but it doesn't surprise me. Yes, the distinction is widespread in the type world: I'm questioning whether it should be, and to what degree it represents an a priori assumption about how we read. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I noted earlier, many languages do not provide vocabulary for such a distinction. When Gerard Unger writes or lectures about what we would term 'readability' in type design, according to Lieberman's definition and common typographic distinction, he calls it 'legibility' since this is the common translation of the Dutch word he uses. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And as I discovered in Thessaloniki, our friends in cognitive psychology simply do not make the distinction. The majority of what we would be obliged, following Lieberman's definition, to call readability studies, are conducted and published as legibility studies.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Would most people consider a script font such as Zapfino legible?  Readable?  IMO it's not terribly readable, and I would be loath to read a book written in it.  I do think it's quite legible in that individual letters and even words are easily decoded, and I am confident it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would<!-- raw HTML omitted --> become readable with practice.  (And Zapfino would be more readable than, say, P22 Cezanne, but I don't find either one illegible.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Double ditto with Comic Sans MS, which has been used by far too many half-crazed office weasels to encode lengthy memos.  It is entirely legible, but not eminently readable&ndash;especially when printed at 75dpi without antialiasing.  (Despite plenty of practice I never did become entirely comfortable reading it.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe there is a useful distinction between the two terms, but I also strongly agree they need to be scientifically defined. Such studies will add value to typography, if for no other reason than to better describe the limits of art versus practical usability.  (And if it helps to suppress lousy office memos, I'm all for it.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would go so far as to say that illegibility does not preclude readability!  I suspect many of us have known husbands and wives where the husband could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->read<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his wife's writing so long as he &quot;knew what it said&quot;, but the writing was so inherently illegible that it precluded reading unfamiliar words, telephone numbers, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's an extreme example, and not everyone would agree with that particular definition; yet I feel that is still a useful distinction to be made.  Other examples might include bad bitmap fonts, low-resolution LED/LCD displays, or printouts from 8-pin dot-matrix printers.  All of these may be easily &quot;decodable&quot; (which may be a better term than legible) but not necessarily easily read.  Any of these may become more readable with practice, but that's equally useful information to know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can imagine situations which might necessitate an unreadable but legible font, like when many similar figures are being displayed and it's important that each one is distinctly noted and checked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, here's a bold definition with testable hypotheses.  Legibility is how quickly an individual letter or word may be decoded; readability is the amount of practice required to learn to &quot;read at full speed&quot; without strain, and may include a herd of relevant factors such as type size and spacing.  Both of these can be measured, although the latter is enormously more difficult than the former to quantify.  (Those dratted test subjects have a nasty habit of learning without telling you.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as I can tell, the cognitive psychologists can't even definitively state there are different modes of reading or what the distinctions are&ndash;let alone determine if glyph-level or word-level legibility is a separate issue from ease of reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry I'm so late to the party, this has been an excellent and lively conversation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William, I envy the excellent conversations that you must have had with Sir Karl Popper. I admire him greatly. It seems worthwhile to mention one of his more important contributions to the philosophy of science. Popper proposed that every good theory should be falsifiable. Basically, that it's possible to run an empirical test that could show the theory to be wrong. For example the parallel letter recognition model predicts that longer words (words with more letters) will take longer to recognize than shorter words because of the additional computation of putting together more letters. If we ran a test and found that long words are recognized faster, then the parallel letter recognition model would be proven false. A theory like creationism is a poor one because there is no test that can ever demonstrate the theory to be wrong. I would likewise put many of Freud's theories into the same category. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What tests can we run that would falsify the bouma model? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, Kevin</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kevin, yes it was a gratifying and unforgetable experience being around a truly great thinker. In my highly biassed opinion the best book on Popper's relevance to cognitive psychology is 'Learning from Error', which I wrote with John Wettersten. The first half, which mainly I wrote, is on Popper and cognitive psychology.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thinking back on those days brings back to mind one of the many things he said that stuck in my mind at the time - 'file for later reflection' - that may be relevant to your work. He said he thought that the periodic reversal in the necker cube optical illusion was due to the mind raplidly trying out hypotheses to interpret the incoming data, and then refuting them and trying another, and refuting it. The necker cube causes an unusual 'loop' in the process. I'm sure Popper would say that some kind of rapid testing process is involved in identifying words. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The bouma model in its more extreme form - that word shape is much more important than individual letters is refutable and refuted. As I mentioned earlier, the research mentioned in the letter reversal discussion here showed that: you can mix letters in a word and still read quickly. So the more extreme form is dead.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is important to understand here, I think, that models in the vague sense of an idea that guides research are not testable. For example the continuous vs atomic views of reality are still vying with one another after several hundred years. As Popper emphasized, what are testable are theories. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A model that is a heuristic idea like 'you can explain reading in terms of word shapes' is too vague to be testable, even though it can inspire testable theories. Some of Popper's followers, such as Agassi (whom I was also a student of) made clear that both research programs, inspired by 'models' and other things, and testable theories are important in the growth of science. But when it comes to evaluation you can only empirically evaluate theories, and only indirectly research programs, by whether they are fruitful or not of new discoveries.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Thomas mentions, the most informative tests are 'crucial experiments' that will discriminate between two competing theories. But both theories must be testable to be so tested.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Agassi pointed out, there is a danger in not distinguishing between research programs and theories. You can always cite confirmations of research programs, but experiements are only scientifically significant when they are potential refutation of theories.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the 'bouma' model, those who are partisans of that research program should come up with theories to test. But no, it is better for anyone researching to come up with testable versions of theories they disagree with, as well as agree with, so they can do crucial experiments.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I think there is more to word recognition than letter recognition, but the challenge is to put forward alternative theories on what that 'more' is, and then to test them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The discussion on emotion vs reason and marriage decisions is something I have written about, but I really don't want to get into it as I will be hours writing out the whole issue - and not exactly relevant here.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will just mention though that a lot of the evolution debate is muddied by a failure to distinguish between testable theories and research programs - evolution 'theory' involves both.</div>

Like I said it's great that you're looking into the effects of letterspacing, but as long as you're not promoting deep immersion you're never going to get any data that refutes your model, because your model is sound for deliberative reading. All you'll see is little blips of strangeness like short and frequent words being skipped more or less - not enough to shake you from your position, not enough to give Doubt real steam. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Hrant has not suggested anything himself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's hard. I've always said that. It's the PL people claiming they've &quot;arrived&quot;, thanks to their shiny computers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can think of a few things though, but the basic thing -again- is implementing a fundamental change in the way data is collected. As I suggested to Kevin in Thessaloniki (and people like Kinross have always maintained this) you can't really measure reading by attaching devices to people at some exact distance from some exact screen, and tell them they're guinea pigs. They'll never read naturally that way. That's why Kevin's data shows such low reading speeds for example. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I've suggested to Kevin is this: get avid readers in their 40s or so, pay them to sign a consent form allowing you to: provide them with reading material*, and secretly observe their reading at any time during let's say a one year span; then if you get enough data about reading times, you'll see all the boumas come out of the woodwork, like little spirits lurking on the page, waiting for people not to look. I promise. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Maybe books of their choice but re-typeset in certain ways. Like a string of chapters with tight spacing and a string with loose. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The big problem is that entails a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of funding. The good news -and the final piece of the puzzle which makes me excited to have Kevin around- is that MS is filthy rich. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Our feelings are submitted to rational judgement <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, you can't seriously think that everybody feels this way. There's something called Intuition, and it's not the same thing as Reason. Or maybe you could say it's a Reason of the Subconscious. But that's totally different than Logic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William, that was a great post. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To try to clarify what the bouma model in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my<!-- raw HTML omitted --> head is, it certainly doesn't say we read whole-word shapes all the time. That's nuts. It simply says that the brain uses as much as it can as fast as it can. So for example when it sees some totally clear letters in the fovea, it compiles them in parallel into words. This is Kevin's stuff. Here boumas are single letters. But it also says that the brain takes &quot;educated guesses&quot; about blurry clusters of letters some way off to the right of fixation (notably where individual letters are undecipherable, even if you give a reader extra time to consider the shape consciously - in fact consciousness might actually be an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obstacle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there). It can do this if the cluster (maybe a word, maybe a part of a word) is crisp, frequent and distinctive enough for the given experience of the reader at hand to have enough faith (never certainty) to consider it read. This is why typos are missed so much. This is heuristics. And yes, it makes empiricists quiver. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, I am not currently investigating differences between serif and san serif fonts. Old Lund reviewed the many studies investigating performance differences between the two font styles, and did not find compelling evidence to support that case. Clearly the different font styles carry emotional differences which are independently valuable. I am involved in investigating performance differences with different amounts of spacing between letters. The work is quite slow going. I believe that you proposed that the optimal letter spacing should be in porportion to the amount of counterspace - this is also the view that Robert Bringhurst has supported in the past. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, Kevin</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;differences between serif and san serif fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Did Lund test or review tests including the variables of line length and leading? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The common view in typography is that sans serifs, in order to be easily readible need shorter lines and/or more leading compared to serif fonts.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thus I would guess that under some conditions sans are equally readable, but under others - longer lines, less leading - serifs would be superior. In particular, I would expect that people would take more time finding the next line - or lose their place within a line as well - with longer lines and less leading with a sans.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm glad to be in such good company as Bringhurst on the importance of the relationship between counters and spacing! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect that serifs also help ease of identifying a word as a word. (this should probably show up in reading speed) This is complicated by the spacing issue. Sans are often more tightly spaced. This would help identify what is a word, but then (if Bringhurst and I are right) the spacing would be less than ideal, and that would affect reading. This is why I think that narrow sans like Meta and Vesta are more readable (and likely more rapidly read) than the very round and tight Helvetica. -The ratios between stem spacing, counters and tightness of letter vs word spacing work better. With serifs the spacing between stems can be looser (and better) but the word still be quickly identifiable as a word because the serifs are linking the letters visually.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, absolute size is also important I think. You can put tight spacing big on the side of a building and it won't slow you down. But at 8 point it will matter a lot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All this (except the bit about counters which I hadn't heard before and on which Bringhurst concurs) is common wisdom. It should be testable, but you will know how hard or easy that is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The letterspacing angle is a much more robust test of PL versus bouma.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't see how. What letterspace testing will do is identify something like optimal letterspacing, but unless this result is extreme in some way, it won't tell us much about the reading process itself. If optimal letterspacing turns out to be roughly what typographers judge to be 'correct', all it will tell us is what we already know: people can read typical typesetting. I think you are assuming a theoretical benefit to the parallel letter recognition from looser letterspacing, and I think that theory is something worth testing, but I don't think we can conclude that this is a fact. As Kevin has pointed out before, the parallel letter recognition model is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->word recognition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> model; we still don't know how people recognise letters. So we can't assume that letter recognition benefits from loose letterspacing, or that bouma recognition benefits from tight letterspacing. These are inductive inferences, but as I noted, some of the studies on lateral masking produced unintuitive results. We can't rely on inductive reasoning. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William has already demonstrated, easily enough, that letter spacing that is obviously too loose and is in c o n s is t e n t makes reading difficult, but as I noted this is because such spacing breaks up words. But this doesn't imply anything about how we recognise specific words, only about how we recognise that something is a word in the first place. The parallel letter recognition theory is based on recognising letters that make up a word; determining that something is a word is a prerequisite for identifying the word. It seems to me that in order to test the bouma theory one would need find a way to inhibit letter recognition while not inhibiting letter-group recognition, and then see what impact this has on reading speed and accuracy. This might, in fact, be possible by spacing the letters so tightly, even overlapping them partly. But one would need first, of course, to confirm the impact of such spacing on letter recognition itself, e.g. by having people try to identify letters in non-word sequences. Before one can know that one is, in fact, testing bouma recognition, one needs to remove the possibility of individual letter recognition from the test as far as possible.</div>

If you show some readability-optimal setting (determined with validity of course) to practitioners and they overwhelmingly say &quot;it's too loose&quot;, then you've implanted doubt into the bouma model. If on the other hand the setting looks &quot;just right&quot;, then yes that's sort of inconclusive.

It will immediately know that something is off, and either become lost or ignore performance. The brain is not a closed box with an input and and output - you can't get at its essence by artifically reducing variables.

<p>In a discussion on another forum, someone gave this example to refute the bouma theory:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn&rsquo;t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.

<p>Now, at first glance, it seems easy enough to read (once you&rsquo;ve discovered it&rsquo;s &ldquo;trick&rdquo;) but how much of that recognition comes from grammatical expectation?  If the words did not form coherent sentences would the recognition be as quick?  If letters form words, and words form sentences then where does sentence recognition not come into play?</p>
<p>I st hi s se n t en ceh ar d t or ea d?</p>
<p>Is tihs stencene hrad to raed?</p>
<p>To is sentence read hard this?</p>
<p>Being able to &ldquo;foreshadow&rdquo; what words are likely to come next, based on the rules of grammar and communication, must play a big role in the speed of word recognition.</p>
