  body: Buy a Hoefler font. Spiffed mine right up. Also, take a look at the MS Word
    resume templates, and make sure that your resume looks nothing like them.

  body: "hmmm i don't think thats as easy as you think...\r\nit depends what you want
    to achieve.\r\njust to give you a font name wont work. \r\nA font itself wont
    make your resume look better designed,\r\nthere is more to it, how you use the
    font, paper format, white space etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Bad resumes are usually those that are trying to hide their lack of content
    behind snazziness. You might say the plainer your resume looks, the more confident
    you are about the achievements on it. I think it's a great opportunity to showcase
    your skills in editorial design.
