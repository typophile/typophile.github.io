    with the logo i&#39;m seeing a slightly agitated face &#40;the &#39;a&#39;s as
    eyes, the flower as nose, and the type below as mouth&#41;.  <BR> <BR>give the
    type on the bottom another go and post for us. '

    in a circle? '

  body: From one Hawaiian to another, Boi you do good kine logos... but listen to
    uncle and redo the stuff on da bottom... k? &#40;hehe&#41; <BR> <BR>With that
    outta the way heres what I would do with the bottom text since it seems to be
    a concert poster and you want people to get the info as quickly and clearly as
    possible. I&#39;d also maybe work on the illustration a little to fill in the
    top more. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1853.jpg"

  body: ' Neh boo ... I dunno if i like dat&#39;kine. :D <BR> <BR>kay, now first off
    ... yeah i see some of your points about the text on the bottom. I thought it
    was a little more dynamic than putting all of the venue info on a horizontal baseline
    at the bottom of the page. I was looking to do something a little more creative,
    but i see your point about it being a bit distracting.  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;  i&#39;m
    seeing a slightly agitated face &#40;the &#39;a&#39;s as eyes, the flower as nose,
    and the type below as mouth&#41;. <BR> <BR>hehe not agitated, the bottom curve
    is the chin, and the flowers a dimple, making it a smiley butt-chin. <BR> <BR>anyhow,
    thanks for all of the comments, this was just a fun experiment for two guys from
    hawaii. the screens have already been burned, no going back at this point :D '
