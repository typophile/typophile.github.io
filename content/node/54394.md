body: "Let us assume a publisher has a paperback, the first edition of which was typeset
  in 8 on 9 point in Adobe Utopia, PS font (PostScript Type 1, font file UTRG____.PFB).\r\n\r\nFor
  the re-edition, the publisher wants to switch to Adobe Utopia, OT font (OpenType,
  font file UtopiaStd-Regular.otf).\r\n\r\nTo his dismay, the publisher discovers
  that Utopia OT typeset in 8 on 9 point is much smaller than Utopia PS typeset in
  8 on 9 point.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/utopia1.gif\r\n\r\nA
  technical analysis reveals that for the generation of the Utopia OT font, the glyphs
  of the Utopia PS font were reduced by 5 percent by Adobe.\r\n\r\nExample: The glyph
  of the capital \"A\" of Utopia PS has a height of 692 units, while the \"A\" of
  Utopia OT is 657 units high, which is 95 % of 692, i.e. reduction by 5 %.\r\n\r\nsee
  http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/utopia2.gif\r\n\r\nSo, if the publisher, for
  technical reasons, must use the OT font format for the re-edition, he himself has
  to convert the old PS font to the OT format via Fontlab instead of using Adobe's
  OT font which reduced the glyph size by 5 percent thus rendering Adobe's OT font
  unusable for the re-edition of the paperback.\r\n\r\nWhy did Adobe reduce the glyph
  size?"

  body: I agree with Mr. Twardoch that Utopia Std is not the same as Utopia, but experimenting
    with a larger point size, as suggested by Mr. Geertsma, is no practical solution
    due to rounding errors. Most word processors do not permit of using fractional
    point sizes such as 8.123456789 pt. Why reduced Adobe the glyph size?

  body: "Many Adobe Originals have undergone smaller or larger redraws when developing
    the OpenType versions \u2014 mostly for aesthetic reasons. Utopia was Robert Slimbach's
    first typeface that he ever did for Adobe, so I'm not surprised he revised it.
    I consider Utopia Std a \"director's cut\". \r\n\r\nI wish he'd had more time
    on that project so a Pro version could be developed, on the other hand, the OpenType
    development project was huge at that time, so they were all working under a very
    tight schedule. Perhaps this will still happen. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Quincunx: 'Converting the old PS to OT doesn\u2019t really make sense, because
    he won\u2019t have any of the features for which he bought the OT version?'\r\n\r\nProbably
    the Adobe EULA does not permit the enduser to convert fonts anyway. Having said
    that, it <strong>is</strong> technically possible to import the features from
    the original OpenType font into a converted one using DTL OTMaster (OTM) or to
    generate a new OpenType font in DTL FontMaster (FM) using the original features.\r\n\r\nIn
    OTM one can export and import the GSUB and GPOS features from and into an OpenType
    font. During import OTM compiles the OpenType Layout features (AFDKO syntax) and
    produces binary OpenType Layout tables. Before importing in the new font probably
    some editing of the features file will be necessary, for instance to match the
    character set of the newly generated OpenType font, and perhaps the syntax has
    to be checked also. Because of the different x-heights and subsequently widths,
    it is in this case advisable to remove the kern pairs and to replace these by
    the ones in the AFM file. \r\n\r\nFor generating an OpenType font with the original
    features in FM, a little bit more work has to be done beforehand, but handling
    the features is easier because these don't have to match the character set. First
    in OTM the features file of the original OpenType font has to be exported. Second,
    a so called Character Layout (.cha) file has to be exported from OTM also (this
    assures that the naming convention in the .cha file is identical to the one used
    in the features file). An encoding vector has to be added to the .cha file (in
    this case the Adobe Standard Encoding will do) for instance with a simple find
    and replace file in/with BBEdit/AppleScript.\r\nIn BezierMaster the original font
    can be converted to BE format and the (checked) features file can be connected
    in the UFM dialog. In this case the character set does not have to match the characters
    listed in the features file, because all features that are not covered by the
    character set (listed in the .cha file) will be removed during the generation
    of the font by the modified URW++ version of Adobe's Hatch Open Type tool (HOT).
    One can also add a few lines to the features files concerning the intermediate
    table block info (this way one can control which information is taken from the
    features file and which not [if somebody is interested I can provide more technical
    info on how the features generation is automated and controlled in FM]). For the
    kerning the AFM file of the PostScript Type1 font can be directly used."

    allowed any editing of a font <em>provided</em> that the font was not resold and
    every user of the changed font had a valid license to the underlying Adobe edition
    of the font. This has been extensively documented on lists and newsgroups, with
    the definitive answers always supplied by Adobe's David Lemon. If only everyone
    else followed Adobe's lead in this respect!

    books published often many years ago). Unless you have kept the old font files,
    you will heve great problems making re-editions of old books without reflow.\r\n\r\nAnother
    great problem are postscript printer drivers. For example, HP's Universal PS printing
    driver and Adobe's Universal PS printing driver create different reflows of the
    same book text files. The same holds true for different releases of Adobe's Distiller.
    All this is a great annoyance."

    a good point, and more than that: if a project is important, of course you keep
    the original font files - - it would be lunacy not to. Many, many responsible
    foundries will revise their fonts often in much smaller ways: for example Robert
    finally grew weary of the excessively tight fitting of the question mark in Minion,
    and longed to change it. I am sure he did in one or another of the dozens of versions
    of Minion, all of which are different, and all of which will cause reflow problems
    if you aren't using precisely the same version of the font that you started out
    with. \r\n\r\nWhenever I have to do a new printing of my photography book with
