  body: "It's not technically a font, it's from a book called \"Letters and Lettering\"
    written in 1902... about 80 years before fonts were invented.\r\n\r\nThere might
    be a font that's similar in style, but it won't be an exact match. These characters
    are pretty unique looking. Perhaps someone knows a face that could be close.\r\n\r\nInitially
    I thought of Benguiat. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/benguiat/familytree.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've done some researching and it turns out it has characteristics of most
    serif fonts, but there are a few things that are different about it that I like.
    The long hooks and curves in particular.

  body: Wow- benguiat looks very little like that face. Hopefully someone else can
    come up with something better (thanks for the timely and well meaning response
    though!)

  body: "Tristis, are you looking for a font with all the circles, or one that looks
    like the main skeleton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincidentally, re: digital type ... this
    is from a Paul Shaw / AIGA piece:\r\n\r\n<strong>1968 (first digital typeface)</strong>\r\nDigi-Grotesk
    S Despite its derivative appearance\u2014it looks like a condensed knock-off of
    Neuzeit Book from Stempel\u2014Digi-Grotesk S is significant because it was the
    first digital typeface. It was created by the staff of Dr. Ing. Rudolf Hell, the
    company that pioneered cathode ray phototypesetters.\r\n\r\n<strong>1975 (first
    original ikarus face)</strong>\r\nMarconi Designed by Hermann Zapf for Hell, Marconi
    was the first original typeface to be produced with the Ikarus computer-aided
    design and digitization system. Ikarus, developed in 1973 by Peter Karow of URW
    (Unternehmensberatung Rubow Weber), was the dominant type design and production
    tool well into the 1990s. "

  body: The circles are for spacing and what-not. I doubt I'm going to find a typeface
    with all the exact quirks of the one pictured- I wonder how much it would cost
    me to have that traced and turned into a font? Surely there are no copyright limitations.

    his Letters and Lettering, from Project Gutenberg. I will notify you if I find
    something relevant. :)\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nBy the way, I think this will be a very
    interesting piece to digitize. Also, the copyright of his book 'Letters and Lettering'
    has long since been expired. If it can be found in Project Gutenberg, then its
    copyright is expired."

  body: "Yes I actually glanced at the page this was referring to, I believe it was
    his own sketch of roman small letters, and when you compare it to Times it actually
    has a few similar features. I also think he does the capital letters in there
    as well.\r\n\r\nI also think this would be an excellent serif font- So if anybody
    is interested I'd love to see where this could go. I'm personally not skilled
    enough with the pen tool to fathom doing something so delicate."
