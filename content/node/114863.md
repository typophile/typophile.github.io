  body: Don't know if it's an original design but [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/sinclair.php|Sinclair
    LHF]] by John Studden is a match.

  body: "Nice catch Ryuk. The sign is obviously based on Sinclair LHF. I knew I had
    seen this one before but couldn't put a name to it. Unfortunately John Studden
    often does not cite any sources that would help to place his fonts in context.
    The tilde, which seems to have been invented by a book cover letterer, Henry Thayler,
    \ puts it between about 1895 and 1915 when it was the height of fashion. The source
    for Sinclair LHF may have been show-card lettering or painted signage.\r\nDon"
