		<div class="commentbody">I got 15. The top 5 takers scored 17-19. <BR> <BR>I feel this year&#39;s quiz was designed for the elderly grayhairs  <BR>like Bill Powers and Dave Farey who won. Don&#39;t let Kent fool  <BR>you, he&#39;s younger than his typographic knowledge indicates. <BR> <BR>BTW, question 35 was much more difficult as they presented <BR>some of the designer&#39;s older, more obscure faces. <BR> <BR>Can we get Kent to upload the original pics?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That&#39;s Will Powers, Stewf! He&#39;s our local typographic encyclopedia -- and much appreciated for it. <BR> <BR>I suck at these games, but they are quite fun to watch. Lots of groans and fun hints. My cropdusting of gray hairs was no help whatsoever. It&#39;s not an age thing: it&#39;s a matter of keeping lots of unrelated information available for output at the proper moment. It should also be obvious that a bit of knowledge of the local typo scene is needed. It&#39;s time to start studying up on the Bay Area! <BR> <BR>I managed to get only one right: <BR> <BR><i>18. Who is the man in this picture? </i> <BR> <BR>My answer: the one on the left! <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">For the record: Allan and I accumulated questions over a period of a couple months, sending them to each other every now and then. In the end, they all wound up in Allan&#39;s lap and he was responsible for the final cut. &#40;I just counted: twelve of the finals were mine.&#41; He put together the PowerPoint presentation, which I reviewed and offered a few corrections and suggestions. Then I created the printed questionnaire form. We met for about ten minutes Friday night to coordinate the presentation. It was fun. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d have to do screenshots from the PowerPoint presentation, which I still have a copy of. But I don&#39;t have PowerPoint &#40;I reviewed the presentation on a client&#39;s system.&#41; I&#39;ll see if I can come up with the images for you. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

No offense, I hope. <BR> <BR>Keith -- In restrospect, I agree, the quiz may have been a little obscure. What can I say? I&#39;m an old fogey deep down inside -- &#40;just ask Tiffany ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>In my defense, I think only three of mine were truly obscure. Well, and that #16 was pretty challenging; I think we should have scored partial points on that one. <BR> <BR>We&#39;ll just have to see what Will and Allan come up with for next year. But you might want to start keeping copies of Lawson and Bringhurst on your nightstand for bedtime reading. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, the questions were easier last year &#40;eg &#34;Who designed Fontesque?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Funny thing is, the quiz was really quite balanced, but there is just so much UNDEAD in typography. I really noticed that driving thru Northern Minnesota, visiting OLD NAVY, retail America with retro scripts from House and Font Diner, and the conservative press with fonts from HTF and the Bureau. And the Book Center exhibit on Bruce Rogers, I mean, imagine going to a software conference and there&#39;s a party in the Turing museum. <BR> <BR>Stephen, is your hair starting to thin...?
