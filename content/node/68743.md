  related topics, but I'm still wondering about this.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to
  calculate the values between two [[weight|weights]]?\r\n\r\nFor instance: I have
  a Harline and a Heavy cut as my two extremes and I want to generate instances for
  the other weights. The thing is that I was these instances to be optically appealing.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance."

    two such extremes; you\u2019ll need a properly balanced regular weight in there
    somewhere or the horizontals and curves coming from them are going to be a mess.
    The upside is that if your extremes are well-drawn you can get pretty close by
    using anisotropic interpolation to start a regular master and finishing it manually.
    \r\n\r\nAs for determining your in-between weights, it comes down to how you want
    the final fonts to work. If you want a more contemporary feel create a lot of
    instances based on whatever mathematical relationship that you like (Lucas math,
    or just ten or twenty even steps, etc) and start testing them against each other
    to see what works. Then tweak/refine/repeat. Or you can study the proportions
    in older typefaces, compare them (spreadsheets work well) and then start calculating
    what would work well in your design. In the latter case you won\u2019t get the
    smooth stepping that comes from the former, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with
    that if it\u2019s what you desire."

    I get that regular master? Can you describe it?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Interpolate your regular master with the vertical stem weights set to whatever
    weight would be appropriate for your typeface (if you don\u2019t know what weight
    to use, get an appropriate height/width ratio from a similar design). Use anisotropic
    interpolation to get horizontals as close as they can be without being too screwed
    up (read the software documentation for more on anisotropic interpolation, or
    google the Superpolator video from Robothon). Depending on how different your
    extremes are you may need to do this multiple times to get the uppercase, lowercase,
    figures, etc.. Put the resulting fonts back together, refine the forms and proof
    them as you would normally. From there either add the regular master to Superpolator
    or create two new MM fonts, one for light extremes and one for heavy extremes.
    \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll also probably find that certain characters, such as <strong>y</strong>
    need to be draw differently on the extremes. If using multiple MM fonts you can
    use the appropriate design for light/heavy versions, in Superpolator just create
    alternates that will interpolate and use them to replace the missing incompatible
    glyphs."
