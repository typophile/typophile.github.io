  body: "Saludos desde San Juan\u2026\r\n\r\nFirst I think it's important that you
    clarify whether you mean <strong>typography</strong> (as in: <em>the practice
    of choosing and setting type</em>) or <strong>type design</strong> (as in: <em>the
    practice of designing the actual glyphs that go into a font for later use on a
    typesetting program/machine</em>). Both are clearly defined (yet always mutually
    referential) activities that, in my opinion, merit a separate project/chapter/exercise/&c.
    for each.\r\n\r\nNow, I have to say I find \"the importance of typography in design\"
    a bit vague. It could well mean one of the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>(a) You mean
    the importance of <em>proper</em> typography in graphic design.</strong> That
    is to say: the development and application of the sensibility necessary to make
    adequate decisions in choosing typefaces and setting them correctly, with practical
    and aesthetic considerations in mind, to produce a graphic product that adequately
    communicates its message. If this is the case, one can never go wrong with Robert
    Bringhurst's <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>. I'm sick of reading praise
    after praise for this book, yet the simple truth remains: it is an excellent reference
    for any designer, at any level of experience. Period.\r\n\r\n<strong>(b) You mean
    the historical, aesthetic and/or technological impact that type design and/or
    typography has had in graphic design as a discipline encompassing formal inclinations
    as well as functional considerations.</strong> That is to say: the influence that
    type design or typography has had on the graphic design craft, including the effects
    that the historical prevalence, aesthetic tendencies and technological limitations
    and advances of type have had on the practice of graphic design and the way it
    communicates with the viewer. If this is the case, I suggest you explore Soviet
    constructivist design, Swiss design and the history of the printing press. Also,
    the recently released Helvetica movie is a great reference I think they might
    enjoy.\r\n\r\n<strong>(c) You mean all of the above!</strong> In this case, I
    might suggest you turn it into separate projects that illustrate the different
    levels of typographic exploration explained above. The importance of typography
    and type design in the practice of graphic design is terribly overlooked in the
    current design education climate in Puerto Rico, as well as our professional practice
    of design. In fact, I'll go as far as saying that typographic sensibility is the
    single worst aspect of editorial, identity, environmental and promotional graphic
    design in our island. It is an epidemic, to be quite honest, and you have a golden
    opportunity to instill in these students a respect and excitement for typography
    that helps shape the way we use type in our country in years to come. So, rather
    than having one project dedicated to the overwhelmingly vast and potentially vague
    theme that is \"the importance of typography in graphic design,\" I suggest that
    you turn it into an recurring theme throughout your class projects, in combination
    with the other themes you use in your curriculum.\r\n\r\n\xA1\xC9xito!"

  body: "Wow! thanks a lot for the knowledge. Totally agree with you about how overlooked
    is typography and type design in the practice of graphic design in our Island.
    It seems to me like the more different type faces you can fit in a 4\" by 6\"
    the better designer you are. (jaja :)   \r\n\r\nI may not be a typophile as some
    might say around here but I wanted to have an impact no matter how small, that
    would have a direct effect on the profession in Puerto Rico. Idealistic I know,
    but true. Now reality, the school only cares about admissions and retaining students,
    the quality of the education and the caliber of professionals they are forming,
    it's their least priority. The quality of the students is really low (I knew that
    from the beginning) I just didn't realize how low. For example a college student,
    that aspires to become a graphic designer, that doesn't know what a 1/4 of an
    inch is. They only care about the technical aspects of the profession, when it
    comes to think, and develop other skills they block. \r\n\r\nNow of what I asked,
    I should have said, letter <strong>(a) The importance of proper typography in
    graphic design.</strong> I'll check the book that you recommend and see what I
    come up with. Thanks a lot. I'll try to keep in contact with you, it seems that
    you can help me a lot. I want to elevate the profession just a little bit. \r\n
