body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nHope someone could help me out here\u2026 deadlines are horribly
  tight and I've got a small problem here I think\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project
  in two languages. Priva is one of the typefaces selected for the project, and noticed
  something a little weird with certain characters.\r\n\r\n1) One of the strange things
  here is that the charcter \u2018B\u2019 in priva looks a little weird. Compared
  to Charter in this image and other typefaces we have, it looks different. Is this
  some sort of alternate version of this character?\r\n\r\n2) This other is that in
  Priva the character \u2018\u044D\u2019 gets inverted and looks like the western
  \u2018E\u2019. I am basically copying all the text from Word and it inverts this
  character whenver Priva is used. Why is this?\r\n\r\nAnybody here ever dealt with
  this situation?\r\nAny recommendations? Sadly, budget's tight\u2026 and looks like
  we can't change the typeface as this is the typeface the client uses on their material.\r\n\r\n:(
  This is the first time I have to deal with a foreign language other than Spanish
  and English. Help! :o)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/111_5409.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/222_5207.jpg]"

    that 'B' and '\u044D' characters on the 2nd slide will not be recognized by the
    Russian audience."

    not recognized\u2019? or are they simply \u2018wrong\u2019?\r\n\r\nI'm sorta freaking
    out. Got tons of pages to lay out with this typeface and no cash to spent on a
    new typeface.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations from anybody on a new Sans?\r\nWill try
    to propose (doubt they will go with this) a new alternative. I needed a sans sorta
    \u2018modern\u2019 (NOT pragmatica, or helvetica-ish) with like 3 weights and
    italics. It has to be somewhat affordable. "

  body: "Thanks Pieter but Fedra was initially a proposed typeface was not accepted
    due to the cost.\r\nIt was perfect for this project. This is a very unrealistic
    and cheap client\u2026 plus there's some ridiculous deadlines.\r\n\r\nI already
    went through Fedra Sans, paratype (nothing with the feel) and Enelka & Vida from
    Stormtype. :o(\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing some other type foundries\u2026 some obscure
    ones\u2026"

  body: "That there is an alternate Greek theta that got dropped in the wrong slot.
    Luckily, you could replace it with a Latin B. The worse problem is that \u044D
    and \u0454 are two different Cyrillic letters.\r\n\r\nI would guess that if you
    contact <A HREF=\"http://www.dstype.com/profile.html\">the creator</A> about these
    two mistakes, he would probably be glad to correct them and replace the font,
    because it's something that can affect future buyers and he would want to know
    about it."

  body: "The glyph sample you show doesn't show all the letters of the Russian alphabet,
    and instead has several archaic letters (\u0462, \u0474, IA, \u0472) and a couple
    of Ukrainian letters (\u0404, \u0406).\r\n\r\nSome of those archaic letters have
    questionable designs in Priva pro. For example, \u0462 looks very strange considering
    it is supposed to be a capital letter. Also, I'm not sure how acceptable a \u0474
    that looks like a V is.\r\n\r\nThere's also something funny going on with the
    outline of the \u0425 as well.\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend that you run
    the typeface choice by typographically-trained Russian eyes. As wonderful as Dino
    dos Santos's Latin typeface designs are, these Cyrillics don't look really professional."

  body: 'Yeah, thats a good point too, there are quite a few Cyrillic characters missing
    from that sample. Regarding whether it''s wrong or not, I was born in Russia,
    and if i saw those characters used in text, I won''t know them. So I guess that
    makes them wrong. '

    keep posting ;o)\r\n\r\nI will contact my bosses right away to see what could
    be done with the extremely tight budget and deadline and cheap client. \r\n\r\n->
    Any suggestion or alternatives for a Sans with a modern feel? Will have to propose
    something new I guess. Cost is extremely important. Sadly, they'd rather have
    wrong characters than dropping more money on a decent typeface :o(\r\nFedra is
    out. Enelka maybe. Vida nah. Most of paratype's catalog bores me and is not that
    modern in this sense.\r\n\r\nThanks again people\r\n"
