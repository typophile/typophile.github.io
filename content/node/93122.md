  body: When I have gotten this error message in the past, it was usually because
    of syntax errors in the feature code. So, as a sensible first step, check your
    braces and semicolons.

    that particular FontLab error message to be quite frustrating, not the least because
    the message is very easy to miss. Here are a few of the things that have sometimes
    gotten around it for me:\r\n\r\nMaking sure that all the name fields in FontInfo
    are filled in\r\nShortening the name(s)\r\nEnsuring that the encoding fields in
    FontInfo aren't blank\r\nGenerating the font as a TTF and then generating it as
    OTF (the software equivalent of kicking it)"

    it would be time consuming. Positive: it might save time in the long run because
    I'm working from someone else's file, which means I might never find out where

    ground up.\r\n\r\nI've downloaded Adobe FDK and although I am new to it, I have

  body: "This error seems to be the catch-all when something interrupts the OTF file
    creation (regardless of whether the problem is actually related to the features).
    \r\n\r\nSome things to check:\r\nDo you have any glyphs which are referenced in
    the Opentype features or classes which are empty (no character or composite in
    the glyph)?\r\n\r\nAre they any open contours anywhere? I've had a few instances
    where a single, unconnected node point showed up in a random glyph."

    noticed that when the font fails to generate, FontLab creates a file called \".notdef\"
    which appears to be a blank glyph. Not sure if this is a \"clue.\"\r\n\r\nToday,
    I made a new font file, imported the referenced glyphs (lining figures, old style
    numerals, lowercase letters, and small capitals) with their respective feature
    code. Attempted to generate a new Opentype PS font with this. Did not work."

    file: a) Generate a Type 1 version, then open it up in FontLab to see if the problem
    disappears; or 2) Generate a TTF font and check to see that all of the characters
    are present (in Windows Font Viewer\u2014double-click on font file\u2014or FontBook).\r\n\r\nThe
    latter option will show if there is a particular character that is causing problems:
    I had a case where none of the characters after the zero showed up. I rebuilt
    the zero from scratch, and everything worked fine after that.\r\n\r\nMay or may
