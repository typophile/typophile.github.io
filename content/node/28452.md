  I'd like the forum to comment on the letterspacing and such in order to give it
  the final refinement.\r\n\r\nThe company is a bit similar to Manpower just on a
  smaller scale. The final color of the logo is P877 (Silver).\r\n\r\nAppreciate it
  - thanks!\r\n\r\n/Henriko"

  body: "The serif on the 'n' is slightly jarring. It's inconsistent with the rest
    of the logo and seems tacked on, although at the smaller size it doesn't look
    too bad. I'm sure someone else will have a better opinion of this.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "At the larger size the Grupp\u2026 kerning needs to be tighter (by differing
    amounts), the \u2026pen feels about right, then see if those changes need to appy
    to the smaller version. I don't mind the serif on the n although I feel the curve
    leading into it is a bit pronounced.\r\nTim"
