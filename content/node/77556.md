body: "Quick technical question, and sorry if it's silly: \r\nI have a PDF with a
  wordmark that I need to use. The wordmark is set using a font that I don't have
  (and don't plan on getting for this one job). The PDF is displaying fine (as the
  font is embedded) but if I open the PDF in Illustrator it replaces the font.\r\n\r\nNow:
  Do I *need* to ask for a new PDF with outlined fonts, or is there any way to somehow
  outline/vectorize the fonts inside the PDF? I do need the logo in vector form, if
  at all possible."

    simply place that PDF as a link when you need to use the logo?

    still -- too often).\r\n\r\nIn addition to Bob's suggestion: if you have a rather
    large screen, and you put your PDF viewer in full screen mode (and the logo is
    not too large), you might even be able to make a screen shot that after reduction
    is still 600 DPI."

  body: "... Hmm. Does that work with embedded fonts? I'd think not, if the same fails
    with Illustrator.\r\n\r\n(I've never understood the internals of Illustrator deciding
    on a whim to outline <em>some</em> text and others not; sometimes one style of
    a font is left as-is, or replaced by a local font, while another style gets converted.)"

    Illustrator and InDesign files and crop etc. Remember Place is different than
    Open.

  body: "Thanks, all! \r\nGood call on the cropping etc and just placing the PDF.
    That's what I've done for now. Ideally they wanted me to change the background
    color, but I'll tell them I'll need an outlined PDF for that\u2026 This is basically
    a favor I'm doing a friend, so I'm not going to spend hours doing funny stuff
    :-), just wondering if there's an easy way."

    in inDesign</li>\r\n<li>draw a paper-colored box covering the logo</li>\r\n<li>set
    the box's transparency to multiply, so it becomes transparent (make sure in your
    flattener preview for \"Affected Graphics\" the whole logo turns pink)</li>\r\n<li>make
    a transparency flattener preset with \"Convert All Text to Outlines\" checked</li>\r\n<li>export
    a new PDF, using the new flattener preset</li>\r\n<li>open the new PDF in illustrator!</li>\r\n</ul>"

  body: 'This is a workaround for CorelDraw but it may work for Illustrator too...?
    I would have cropped around the logo, printed it much bigger (eg 1000%) as a pdf
    and saved the resulting pdf as an eps in Acrobat (do later versions of Acrobat
    allow <Save as...eps>?)Then open the eps file (in Corel, at least) with text converted
    to curves on opening. Does Illustrator not allow you to open with text as curves
    at the outset? '

    note to InDesign CS4 users: In order to select the transparency flattener preset
    in the Advanced panel of the Export Adobe PDF dialog, you have to change your
    compatibility from the default \"Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4)\" to an older standard. Acrobat
    4 (PDF 1.3) works."
