body: Some time ago I saw a font that somone had designed that was based on that old
  tattoo style lettering, similar to something like bremuda &#40;sp&#41;. They were
  offering it for free download, and I cant seem to find this now that I need it <IMG

    new tattoo font as part of the new font set I&#39;m releasing BEFORE Typecon!
    <BR> <BR>I may post a graphic to tease you with! You are however correct about
    a previous post in that our pal Christian Acker of Cubanica created a nice Tattoo

    who died in 1927, but you tracked down one of his last clients in a San Diego
    retirement home...

  body: Somboedy e-mailed me a few years back and asked for an authentic tattoo font.
    This was an amalgum of my research. I also was aware of Christian&#39;s font so
    I decided if I was gonna do one that I had to do a convincing job of one that
    was original enough to bring to the masses. <BR> <BR>It was doubly verified for
    &#39;street cred&#39; with tattoo barren fellow type designer Brian Bonislawsky
    of Asigmatic. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: Looks like a cousin to the Art Deco lettering style that Benton turned into
    &#34;Broadway&#34;. Or Cooper&#39;s modernistic &#34;Boul Mich&#34;. Was the 1930s
    the classic era for tattoo art? <BR> <BR>The decorated version has a real circus/fairground
    feel. But as a device, it seems much older, 19th century -- I suspect circus/fair
    tradition preserved that look. There is an old wood type called &#34;Circus&#34;
    that has the &#34;half &amp; half&#34; motif. Did tatoo artists travel with the
    show?

    Just kidding, just kidding. <BR> <BR>HA  HA. :D I thought it was funny. <BR> <BR>Stuart,
    your face is looking really nice. It definately has a much more refined feel to
    it than Sailor Gothic, much more of a typophiles version of Tattoo type . Nicks
    comment to Benton or Cooper are interesting, because I think your version does
    have a bit of their spirit to it. It does a nice job of elevating the vernacular
    to a different place than where it started. Mine tends to keep a lot of the quirks
    of the &#34;unedumicated&#34; letterer. <BR> <BR>&#62;Was the 1930s the classic
    era for tattoo art? <BR> <BR>Sort of. The motifs started in the late 19th Century
    but really came into their own by WWI &amp; II. The American Tradition was established
    between 1920 and 1960, with some designs by guys like Gus Wagner dating as far
    back as 1900. Most of the design motifs we see today are revivals of the highpoint
    in American designs from the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, artists like Sailor Jerry,
    Don Hardy, Bert Grimm to name a few who helped define the aesthetic. By this point
    the motifs had been established for years and the craft was stressed more.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62; There is an old wood type called &#34;Circus&#34; that has the &#34;half
    &amp; half&#34; motif. Did tatoo artists travel with the show? <BR> <BR>Again,
    sort of, think ports and sailors, in New York it was Coney Island,Times Sq and
    the Bowery. In LA it was the Pike, in Honolulu it was Hotel Street. Carneys, Tattoos
    and Sailors always seemed to go together. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Christian'

    get it out. I didn't quit, found the right text, the right font and got me my
