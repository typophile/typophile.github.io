    from the early part of the 2oth century--do you know the year?\r\n"

  body: "Carmelle has bulb serifs like Cooper Black but othersise is a long way from
    Oswald Cooper\u2019s type designs of 1920. It has about the width of Cooper's
    Cooper Black Condensed, a \u201Ccondensed but not squeezed\u201D variation on
    the Cooper Black theme released in 1925. \r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/wordshape/cooper-black-condensed\">Cooper
    Black Condensed</a> available from Wordshape is similar in width to Carmelle.\r\nBut
    Cooper Black, regular or condensed, is too heavy for Carmelle.\r\nBitstream includes
    a bold weight in its <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cooper/\">CooperBT</a>,
    but the width is wrong for Carmelle.\r\nThe photo-compostion era produced some
    alternatives to Cooper, such as Photo-Lettering Inc.'s Cavanagh Hamilton, but
    the ones I have seen are not much closer than Cooper.\r\nDoes your friend have
    any idea where Carmelle came from?\r\nLogo? Advertisement? When?\r\nIf it's a
    modern logo it would be feasible to compress Cooper Black to the width of Carmelle,
    which would more or less match Carmelle's bold weight, and edit letters to match
    this design. Extensive editing would be required.\r\nDon"

  body: "A logo for Columbia records from 1923 in somewhat similar lettering to Carmelle,
    but without the bulge below the baseline. An interesting design 3 years after
    Cooper Black and 2 years before Goudy Heavyface.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownColumbia1923_6257.jpg]\r\nDon"
