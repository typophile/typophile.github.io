  body: It's close to Gotham, Avenir (Avenir Next), Proxima Sans (Proxima Nova), but
    it doesn't appear to be an exact match for any of those. I'm curious, as it's
    pretty well done.

  body: "Well-played, Jan.\r\n\r\nYves, you're giving me too much credit for the ID.
    Had I said, \"it's a pre-digital face from back in the day when everyone introduced
    a geometric face in the wake of Futura's success,\" then maybe I'd deserve a co-ID
    credit.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, this one should be all Jan!"
