body: "Hello friendly font-specialists,\r\n\r\nI am looking for the name of this font.
  It is printed in a youth game-book. The topic are computers and hackers. I tried
  Identifont and WTF but I could not find the right one. The Stop-font was pretty
  close but not an exact match. The book is printed in Germany in the year 2011.\r\n\r\nPlease
  excuse the bad picture I can try to take another one if the quality is to bad to
  identify it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pic-upload.de/view-23579884/fontid.png.html\"><img

  body: As Don said <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/sonic/|Sonic
    Cut Thru Heavy]]</strong> is a good option. Probably with a white outline to make
    it a bit thinner...
