body: "Just got my copy of John Boardley's Codex journal, issue 2. There is some wonderful
  stuff in there, though there's also a lot of very sloppy proofreading, including
  misspelling names of contributors, and other typos. There are also some small typographical
  quirks, like putting people's initials in small caps in running text and hyphenating
  ragged text, that look a bit strange to me. The book reviews are good, and I'm about
  to jump into the extensive Menhart section that comprises most of this issue.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone else taken a look at this?"

    become a collectors item no doubt :)\r\n\r\nn."

    can be legitimate. It is what is known as a soft rag, as opposed to a hard rag,
    but it should be done judiciously, either manually or with careful setting of
    hyphenation options, and only to avoid extreme differences in line length resulting
    from hard rag.\r\n\r\nSorry to hear about the proofreading issues.\r\n\r\nMy copy
    has not arrived yet."

    it (with or without corrections). In fact it's pretty much guaranteed it'll sell
    out and you'll be stuck buying the PDF version.\r\n\r\nErgo: don't wait - it's

  body: "I liked it, but found the quality a bit lacking in repro. The Menhart bit
    has some very sloppy and unclear quoting which is confusing to read and makes
    weird design. In all I also found the design a bit dull with the beautiful content.
    I mean, quite often the tension between the images, text and elements (colored
    blocks etc) was just off. \r\n\r\nSuch as with the cover, I know the reason for
    it, but pick one, type or photograph, and work further from that. Codex doesn't
    need tabloid-shop covers to sell, so make the most of it, hardly any other magazine
    designer (unless you count special subscriber versions) has that freedom.\r\n\r\nThese
    are nitpicks though, so far I've enjoyed the content a lot and it has kept me
    reading (and looking!) for the last evenings."

    one of the best typography periodicals. Like the academic\u2013designer mix.\r\n\r\nI
    find the coated stock a somewhat unhappy choice, though. Prepress on the images
    could have been better. Liked the overall design of the first issue better.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    hope to see a long and glorious future for Codex!"

  body: "I received mine today! Compared to the first issue, this edition is much
    subtle. It is more pleasant to read the text \u2014 you might get distracted by
    colorful illustrations or large alphabets, though. I like the way it smells, but
    the paper is too light for my taste. Overall, it's something lovely to have, but
    I don't have the same festive feelings which I had for the first issue. It doesn't
    have the academic peculiarity which I'd prefer; less images and more text."

  body: "I am pleased to announce the publication of The Eternal Letter: Two Millennia
    of the Classical Roman Capital, edited by Paul Shaw and published by The MIT Press.
    It is the first in an annual series called \"Codex Studies in Letterforms.\" The
    books will be available wherever books are sold in the U.S. next week, a couple
    of weeks later in Canada, sometime in March in the U.K. and Europe, and in April
    in Asia and Australia. It can be ordered now on the various Amazon sites.\r\n\r\nThe
    series is the outcome of the late Codex magazine. As the magazine had become more
    ambitious and more focused on themes, turning it into a book series made the best
    sense; the headaches of distribution and shipping would taken up by others, freeing
    us to concentrate on content. We've also had generous support from Adobe/Typekit,
    Monotype, Mark Simonson Studio, and Courier Corporation. The terrific John Boardley
    signed over the keys to Paul, who's now running it with Linda Florio, the designer,
    and me as producer, coeditor, and general impresario. Paul and I are longtime
    friends and I was producer of the MIT Press edition of his Helvetica and the New
    York City Subway System.\r\n\r\nWhat distinguishes this book from most other books
    about type and letterforms is that its authors\u2014there are 24 of them\u2014are
    largely master craftsmen, including many of the leading type designers, stonecarvers,
    and letterers of our time mixed with serious historians. The contributors include
    John and Nicholas Benson (in a deeply informative conversation with Richard Kindersley),
    Frank E. Blokland (on the transition from Classical letterforms to type), Matthew
    Carter (on the making of his Mantinia type), Ewan Clayton (on Eric Gill's capitals),
    Lance Hidy (on his Penumbra type), Jost Hochuli (on Walter Kaech), Jonathan Hoefler
    (on Requiem), Scott-Martin Kosofsky (on the birth of Adobe Trajan), Gerry Leonidas
    (on Adobe Trajan Greek), Martin Majoor (on Jan van Krimpen's capitals), Steve
    Matteson (on Goudy's inscriptional letters), Gregory MacNaughton (on Father Edward
    M. Catich), James Mosley (on the Renaissance revivals of Classical letterforms),
    Werner Schneider (on his Senatus type), Julian Waters (on Waters titling), Maxim
    Zhukov (on the Trajan letter in the Soviet Union), Yves Peters (on Trajan at the
    movies), and Paul Shaw on very many things. \r\n\r\nIt's a big book, well printed
    and bound (hardcover), with well over 400 illustrations\u2014full color throughout\u2014including
    many things that haven't been seen in print before.\r\n\r\nWe're working on the
    next two volumes: Aspects of Typographic Modernism (2016) and a book about Neoclassicism,
    concentrating on new research about Bodoni and his circle (2017). And we've mapped
    out five further volumes. Our aim is to publish serious work on serious typographic
    and lettering subjects. We are eager to hear your opinions and ideas.\r\n\r\nAND
    . . . there will be launch event at the Type Directors Club, New York City, on
    Thursday, February 19th, 6:00-8:30 pm. Admission is free (thanks to MIT Press),
    but they ask that you register in advance, so we don't run out of food and drink,
    especially drink. https://www.tdc.org/event/the-eternal-letter/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    entirely with you on the non-Latin volume. As you know, my work in Hebrew is in
    some ways parallel to yours in Armenian. Paul and I have discussed just such a
    book, and your name was certainly on our lips. But on the schedule we have now,
    it wouldn't come up for about six years. It's worth revisiting. There's no restriction
    for keeping it to one book per year; the problem is logistical. We should have
    a serious talk, you and I.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nScott"
