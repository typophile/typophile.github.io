  Papyrus. Since visiting his site, I've found my world being invaded by Papyrus.

  body: I for one applaud the use of Papyrus is an many contexts as possible. Back
    before I read typographic forums, my (now) wife and I used Papyrus on our wedding
    invitations. Now, wherever we see it we can say, "They're playing our font!."
    If it helps, I can say that we used TeX to typeset the invitations.

  body: "I admit Papyrus is something I's be hard-pressed to find a use for, but on
    the other hand it's selling it's head off. And why is nobody dumping on Nuptial.
    It's everywhere, and it ain't that well drawn.\r\n\r\nIf I could make a typeface
    that would sell like either of these I'd be delighted.\r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

  body: I think it's because while Nuptial is no work of master craftmanship, papyrus
    is so gimicky and tacky.
