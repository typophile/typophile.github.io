    You might consider making &#34;hybrid&#34; numerals too - in fact I&#39;d make

    a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change, and if
    I took all in account, it would end up either like regular old-style or lining

    type-design, I was wondering how many characters I should make, I don&#39;t really
    know how they all are supposed to look <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;">  <BR>&#40;I know the alphabet, of course, and the letters used in
    swedish, &aring;,&auml;,&ouml;, but I&#39;m having trouble with things like the
    difference in lenght between en dashes and em dashes and various other characters&#41;
    <BR>So, Is there any standard on how many &#40;and what&#41; characters there
    should be in a &#40;professional&#41; typeface. <BR> <BR>2. Distribution. <BR>I
    was thinking of making my bitmap faces &#40;designed mainly for flash use...&#41;
    available freely.  <BR>Is this a good/bad idea?  <BR>I invest quite alot of time
    in the tiny bitmapped stuff, but it feels like taking money for the typefaces
    wouldn&#39;t work. <BR>  <BR>Planned for this typeface for example is an extensive
    set of characters, small caps, different numeral sets and italics...oh yeah, and
    bitmap ornaments! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work,
    and a fee for commercial use? Is there any foundries accepting submissions of
    pixel fonts? Help me out here, please! '

  body: '&#62; the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height
    <BR> <BR>! <BR>They look so much smaller... Maybe the tall &#34;Z&#34; next to
    the short zero exagerates the difference. OK, just ignore what I said.  :-/ <BR>
    <BR>&#62; The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps. <BR> <BR>That makes
    sense, since the old-styles are x-height &#40;this time I actually measured to
    make sure...&#41;, and you want smallcaps to be a bit larger. <BR> <BR>&#62; What
    about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions
    on what to change <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t remember such suggestions... Anyway, here&#39;s
    the best on-line sample that I know of: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html</A> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    become conviced that -overall- the Carter numerals &#40;as I &#91;personally&#93;
    have now decided to call them&#41; offer the best balance in most situations.
    <BR> <BR>In your case I would make the &#34;x-height&#34; of the Carter numerals
    one pixel smaller than what you currently have for your linings, and extend the
    traditional old-style choices&#42; by two pixels. <BR> <BR>&#42; Except maybe
    make the &#34;2&#34; ascend - possibly by one pixel only. <BR> <BR>&#62;  I was
    wondering how many characters I should make <BR> <BR>Start with ASCII-8 &#40;for
    both platforms&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t really know how they all are supposed
    to look <BR> <BR>That&#39;s of course a major thing in type design. And sometimes
    designers will agree quite closely on things, other times not at all. And some
    designers worry a lot about the quality of such &#34;extra&#34; characters, while
    others just slap them together. <BR> <BR>Obviously, the more you look at precedents
    &#40;especially of course reputable ones&#41;, the better your results will be
    - as long as you don&#39;t &#42;mimic&#42; anybody - think things through yourself,
    and apply your conclusions. For example, the en/em issue raises all kinds of opposing
    opinions, so in that case it&#39;s better to simply look at what those characters
    are supposed to &#42;do&#42; in text, instead of copying some precedent. Another
    example: many people make the Florin upright, but I&#39;ve heard that the authentic
    form is slanted; this type of thing obviously deals with cultural preferences,
    so it&#39;s much harder to get right, as it can&#39;t really be &#34;thought through&#34;
    as much. <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s this: <BR><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm</A>
    <BR> <BR>&#62; taking money for the typefaces wouldn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>For
    bitmap fonts it only works if you have a stellar reputation - like Matthew Bardram.
    <BR> <BR>Otherwise, consider doing this: <BR>Make outlines, and have two versions
    of the font: one bitmap-only, the other with both outlines and bitmaps. You give
    away the former, get people &#34;dependent&#34; on it, and sell the full version.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a
    fee for commercial use? <BR> <BR>There are various schemes like that, but I think
    they&#39;re generally not flexible enough, and tend to be more complicated than
    people like. <BR> <BR>Consider this instead: <BR><A HREF="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082"

    <BR> <BR>&#62; Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? <BR>
    <BR>Some of them are probably here listening, so wait and see. <BR> <BR>hhp'
