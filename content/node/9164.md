  body: I know it isn&#39;t exact, but if we don&#39;t find something closer, you
    could use T-26 <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/leger/bold/testdrive.html?s=peaKTop&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Leger</a> by making the lower case and u.c. the same size and
    using the &#39;a&#39; upside down for the &#39;e&#39;.

  body: Thanks Mike, this is indeed the closest match. <BR> <BR>I was also looking
    at some Buro Destruct and Identikal fonts &#40;the style is somewhat similar&#41;
    but Leger is closest.
