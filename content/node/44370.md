    an additional $5? That seems a bit convoluted."

    of Photoshop -- the former is for photographers and designers, has more features,
    and is more expensive, while the latter is a simplified, less expensive version,
    for people who want to fix up their family snapshots but are not pro photographers."

    there were a significant price difference, I'd be licensing a lot more fonts from
    third parties and doing it with a \"personal\" license. But that's just me.\r\n\r\nI
    think the interesting question is whether people's total income goes up with this
    alternative licensing scheme. John Collins says that apparently it has, and the
    foundries that tried it are really happy with the results.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
