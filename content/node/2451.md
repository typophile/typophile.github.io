body: A colleague and I are directors for a small print-and-online publishing venture,
  and we&#39;re looking for a sans serif face that will complement our serif face
  of FF Scala. Scala Sans would be the obvious choice, but the package would exceed
  our budget &#40;and we are watching our budget closely&#41;. <BR> <BR>We&#39;d like
  a moderately-priced, distinctive &#40;under-appreciated, not overused&#41; typeface
  with at least a full family &#40;in a perfect world, we might like some alternate
  characters, too&#41;. We looked at Parisine, but its differences from very familiar
  faces are more subtle than we might like; at Scala Sans, but we can&#39;t afford
  the whole package; at several other faces as well. Stephen Coles suggested that
  I raise the question here. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re wondering whether the community at
  typophile would offer some thought-provoking advice. &#40;Actually, we &#42;know&#42;
  the community will -- we&#39;re hoping that we benefit from it.&#41;

  body: Thanks, PAtrick and Nick. I&amp;#8217;m looking into the Latin Modern collection.
    I&amp;#8217;ll run Lux past my colleague; it seems attractive, though the full
    package wouldn&amp;#8217;t run much less than Scala Sans &#40;at which point we
    might as well just spend the extra twenty dollars or so&#41;. I note that Nick
    recommended the Scalas in his &amp;#8220;Perfect Set&amp;#8221; article &#40;accessible
    through the &amp;#8220;Beginning a Font Collection&amp;#8221; thread here.  <BR>
    <BR>I wished that my colleague would go for John Sans from Storm, but he thought
    it too idiosyncratic.
