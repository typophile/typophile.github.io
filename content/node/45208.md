    of anything typographic that would <em>not</em> be covered by this \u2013 well,
    okay, that was an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nTime period: of all times \u2014 post WWII
    \u2014 digital era \u2014 recent?\r\nGeography/spread: world-wide \u2014 US \u2014
    Europe \u2014 local?\r\nStyle/Importance: avant-garde/outstanding \u2014 idiosyncratic/representative
    \u2014 anything?\r\n\r\nWhich Garamond?\r\n\r\nGeneral clues for finding typefaces
    in use:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/12344\">Search</a> typophile.com.
    Most of the faces you need have been asked for before. Like <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/42959\">Meta</a>.\r\n\r\nLinotype.com
    has a pretty neat <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2106/byalphabet.html\">in
    use section</a>\r\n\r\nEspecially if you\u2019re looking for images, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mrs.%20eaves&w=all\">searching
    Flickr</a> (or similar services) has proven helpful, to me. You might try adding
    \u2018font\u2019 or \u2018type\u2019 to your query, when searching for short/ambigous
    terms like \u2018Franklin\u2019, \u2018Meta\u2019 or \u2018DIN\u2019.\r\n\r\n

    already have some of these, but not all; this was really helpful.\r\n\r\nTo answer
    Florian, I will narrow my request down: contemporary, recent works; US and Europe;
    anything, from outstanding to common. Any Garamond will do, apart from the crappy
    Monotype. \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to everyone... Keep posting.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "oh boy, Gill Sans is EVERYWHERE.\r\n\r\nTwinning's tea package has it (oh
    those british)\r\nthe BBC's logo (again, british)\r\n\r\nSee Gill Sans was created
    in the mid-twenties by a british sculptor, Eric Gill.  Once you know a little
    about the typefaces you're looking for, you can start to find them where you'd
    expect.\r\n\r\nI know the font on the keys of my keyboard is VAG rounded.  I don't
    know where to find another example of it, but considering it was made for Volkswagen
    AG, I can imagine Volkswagen would be a good starting point for my research.\r\n\r\nTry
    to 'meet the type' as though it's a child of the creator.  You know it's name,
    but what's it's personality, what's is nationality.  Does it have other brothers
    and sisters?  Cousins?  What was it derived from.\r\n\r\nBest of luck on your
    little adventure!\r\ninnovati!"
