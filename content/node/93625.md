  over uppercase, would it be worth examining the case of license number plates as
  well?\r\nI'm really bad at remembering car plates, and I think it's partly attributable
  to the block shape issue. So I wondered whether they might be easier to read and
  remember if, at the least, the letters were set in lowercase (probably large x-height).
  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this? Is it worth investigating, or is
  it a non-issue? \r\n\r\n<em>By the way, I'm nowhere near as well-versed in type
  research, theory, and practice as many of you are, so please be gentle if I seem
  uninformed.</em>"

  body: Numberplates  generally don't display words or names so perhaps mixed case
    wouldn't help as much as in signs. Also, would they replace any lining figures
    with old style figures if this was done?

    size and improved readability at the same time, although I don\u2019t think readability
    is the whole problem. Alphanumerics and random strings of characters are hard
    to read and to remember. Making plates the size the back of a car wouldn't help
    me with  something like \u201CB396 BWT\u201D. When I re-read this this post, my
    eyes come to a dead stop at that made-up license #. \r\n \r\nDon't tell the cops
    this 'cause I don't actually like the idea, but in name of efficiency, they could
    reduce the text size of the plate number by about 25% (& why not use upper and
    lower case), then put a machine readable bar code on the plate."

    on a license plate don't have a \"bouma\" - an overall shape that distinguishes
    a word in lowercase due to its pattern of ascenders and descenders.\r\n\r\nThus,
    uppercase wins out as absent this factor, it's equivalent to lowercase with an
    x-height of 100%.\r\n\r\nI don't expect license plates in American Uncial any
    time soon."

    bill, SB 1453, which passed without a dissenting vote on May 28, 2010, authorizes
    the DMV to partner with innovation companies for the purpose of researching, developing

    potentially bring significant benefits to the State of California and its taxpayers
    by realizing significant cost savings by using digital electronic license plate
    technology to streamline distribution, activation, and registration of license
    plates. The technology could also be used to broadcast critical real-time traffic
    and public information such as Amber alerts and emergency traffic updates to drivers\r\n\r\n\"But
    it is its potential to generate revenue from advertising that could provide the
    real financial boon for the state. If approved the DMV would be able to charge
    private vehicle owners for the right to display commercial advertising or other
    images that would take personalized number plates into the 21st Century by displaying
