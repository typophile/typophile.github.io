  body: "These are indeed not \"fonts\" in the sense that they would be available
    in digital format to use on your computer. These characters are made specifically
    for the plate-making machines that produce them.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of
    typefaces available that either were modeled after or resemble various types of
    license plates. In this instance I would look into [[Tobias Frere-Jones]]'s <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/garage_gothic/?sample_text=ABTP%20357&sample_size=74\">Garage
    Gothic</a> or [[Christian Schwartz]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/pennsylvania/?sample_text=ABTP%20357&sample_size=74\">Pennsylvania</a>.
    Also check out the collection of license plate fonts from <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/\">Lineto</a>."
