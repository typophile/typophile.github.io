  body: "Fluffy - i don't want to be braggy, but the reason Jimmy is here is that
    we're better than Identifont.\r\n\r\nThe smaller type is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=solex%20ot\">Solex</a>.
    The big stuff is likely <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/raleigh-gothic-rr/?refby=typographica\">Raleigh
    Gothic</a>."
