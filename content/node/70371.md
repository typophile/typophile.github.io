body: "Hello Typophiles. I am a hobby printer who works mostly with metal type. I'm
  hoping you can offer some helpful comments on the use of the two lowercase g's that
  came with a font of Bulfinch Oldstyle. This face was designed in 1903 by William
  Martin Johnson for use in the <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>. Although I think it
  was used mostly for heads, it was cast in sizes all the way down to 6 points. I'm
  using 18-point Bulfinch to set a short text block, and I'm not sure whether to use
  only one of the g's (and if so which one), or whether to use both (and if so how
  to determine which to use where). Thanks for your comments!\r\n\r\nBarbara[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bulfinch_4971.jpg]"

    the second g being more \"modern\" and adventuresome. I like the face and did
    a digital version for my own use a few years ago - I used the second g for my
    basic version default.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Bob -- I think! The only worry I have about my Bulfinch project is
    that it's too sentimental, so now I don't know whether the sassy second g would
    mollify or clash with it. Structurally it's more closely related to the other
    letters, especially, say, the c. But of all the lowercase letters, it draws the
    most attention to itself and might make the face appear too look-at-me. Still
    deciding! ~Barbara
