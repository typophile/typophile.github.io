body: "This is my business card. It has all I think a good business card should have:
  basic contact info and some creativity, all of that in a white, one sided card with
  black text. The creativity is up to the reference for my name's correct pronunciation,
  inspired by language dictionaries, since I don't know many people who can correctly
  say this funky german names...\r\n\r\nI didn't think my visual ID needed a symbol,
  as I already have a impossible to pronounce remarkable name and surname. I also
  didn't fill my card with fancy graphics, as I preferred to show my creativity in
  a more discrete way. Anyone interested in more of my work can visit my online portfolio
  ([[http://www.behance.net/gerhardschlee|behance.net/gerhardschlee]], from where
  I took most of this text). By the way, the typeface I used is the beautiful [[http://www.akalollip.com/blog/?p=1673|Fengardo]].\r\n\r\nOne
  thing I've sought in this work was to avoid cliches and seek differentiation through
  simplicity. One of my references was the [[http://swisslegacy.com/2011/01/27/paul-rands-business-card/|business
  card]] of the legendary Paul Rand, which probably all of you already know. Just
  like uncle Paul, I tried to break the monotony of my design by aligning the informations
  asymmetrically, but still in a harmonic way.\r\n\r\nI believe I managed with this
  work to make something creative and attractive without too much visual pollution.
  Many people try a minimalist style and end up being simpleton, instead of being
  simple. I think a good minimalist design is, on contrary of what it may look for
  some (clients, mainly), hard to achieve.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, people?\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "Hello Gerhard!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, big pinch of salt reading my opinion.
    I like a lot what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nThe first thing what I did with your
    post was check your image and I though that this was a very good ling\xFCist business
    card because that was my first quick link with the concept. But then I read your
    comment and I realised that you're a designer. So, there's maybe something missing
    in your B-card, and I say maybe because I don't live in Brazil and I don't know
    you or your work, because if you can be so persuasive with your clients and be
    sure that all of them or at least the majority will remember that you're a designer
    (because of your recognizable work or personality or both), I should say that's
    not a bad decision at all. But if that's not the case analize that a bit more.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the design, It works well, maybe the three lines of data could be a bit smaller.\r\n\r\n

  body: "sesch, thanks a lot for your great comment. About the \"missing something\",
    I will consider it. I always try to distribute my business cards personally, to
    ensure people will associate it with my personality, just as you said. But yes,
    the card, in itself, really does have this problem you mentioned, I think. \r\n\r\nI
    will analyze the feedback from potencial clientes with this card, and if this
    problem proves nasty, I will make some changes, for sure. But until now, it have
    being working fine!\r\n\r\nAt the start of the project, I even considered filling
    the back side of the card with a grid-like abstract pattern, but I ended up droping
    out this idea for the sake of a more minimalistic aspect. Do you think it would
    suit?"

  body: Gary, thanks for your comment. I even considered using some more "traditional"
    looking grotesque sans, but ended up choosing something with more personality,
    for a bigger contrast with the rather rational layout. I made it this way because
    my business card is focused in both B2B and B2C approachs. An overly sober business
    card wouldn't work for me. Also, using Akzidenz Grotesk or anything close to that
    in this specific case would feel too much like a cliche to me.

    cardboard paper that adds a really nice effect to business cards, the name for
    this type of paper fades me though.

  body: 'I really like BrettR''s idea of doing a letterpress "watermark"/logo on that
    card stock-like paper. I think that it would be really interesting to play with
    a G inside a circle: something scripty, but clean. Also you can keep it simple
    but make it more visually appealing if on the side that you watermark, you make
    it a 5-10% black. I don''t know if that goes against keeping everything white
    like you mentioned, but just something to consider.'

  body: "Another thing you can do is raised lettering (or sunken).  I am personally
    a fan of raised lettering because people tend to run their fingers along it, making
    them look at the card for a longer period.\r\n\r\nI am sure you have all seen
    this clip, it's a classic.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISYzA36-ZY|American

  body: Not sure if it's just me, but the bottom left white space is making me tense.
    It's drawing my eye more than any of the text. That white rectangle is almost
    too defined. Have you tried other arrangements? Maybe aligning the  contact info
    lines with the pronunciation text? Otherwise, definitely a fan of the simplicity.
