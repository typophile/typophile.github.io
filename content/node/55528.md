body: "Dear typophiles,\r\nHere are two serif faces that came out of my calligraphy
  study with Edward Johnston's writing manual. The first type is based on his \"simple-written\"
  method and the 2nd on the \"gothic\" variation of the \"built-up\" method.\r\n\r\nThese
  are intended to be used for continuous text (~8-12 pt) printed on paper. \r\n\r\nAll
  comments welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simple-written_built-up_3803.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simple-written_5727.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/built-up_6459.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em><strong>Quincunx:</strong> \"Although the examples you mention seem to
    be leaning to the right instead of the left. But I guess that is a matter of choice.\"</em>\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see in the first typeface of the sample, the counter of the O, the Q,
    the o and other letters leans to the left noticeably. And, yes: it's a matter
    of choice.  ;-) \r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

  body: "@Marcelo, yes, I noticed too. But I think the leaning is a bit more apparent
    in your design. :)\r\n\r\n@juhani, talking about the top image, the C, D, G, O,
    Q, and S are too heavy."

    & Illuminating & Lettering'', ''Lessons in Formal Writing'' or another one?'

  body: "I'll check the heavier weights and the leaning counters. Both are unintentional.
    Although regarding the counters, overall balance is what I'm looking for. The
    'o' has been tricky. The angularity & asymmetry can get a bit glaring, especially
    in small sizes.\r\n\r\nI've used the 2 books you mention. I didn't use a turkey
    quill, though.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments.\r\n"

    bit lighter, straighter & simpler round caps, I hope.\r\n\r\nI attached a PDF
    of the two types if someone would like to comment on a printed result.\r\n"

  body: "Maybe bring in the bottom serif or lengthen the crossbar of 'T'? It looks
    a little too close to 'I' in the running text. 'C', 'G' and 'S' look a bit like
    they are dripping from their top terminals!\r\n\r\n'K' and 'Z' are the handsomest
    letters to my eyes. (Maybe 'K' could be a touch wider.)"

  body: "Thanks for your feedback, eliason. \r\n\r\nI added 20 units to the T-crossbar
    width (& took out 10 from the bottom serif). I don't know if that makes any difference...maybe
    the crossbar should be thicker as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simpleforexample_3521.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYes,
    the C G & S terminals don't look like what they're supposed to. Perhaps the edge-stroke
    terminals are impossible (too ridiculous) to bring into type. I'm generally worried
    about doing a too literal calligraphy imitation anyway. On the other hand, I sort
    of like the 'drips' because they have a likeness to the thin baseline serifs in
    the lowercase. Here's a variation & without:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/congos_6045.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Did you try a serif going the other way - up and to the right, away from
    the counter - at the top of C/G/S? \r\n\r\nFix to the T looks good, and those
    numbers/punctuation are very nice. (8 may be topheavy.)"
