  if anyone had any recommendations for a typeface off the top of their head that
  had a similar look and feel?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    in the Edwardian style. Letterhead Fonts has several offerings--mostly in their
    1900 and 1910 lines--that might work. If you would like to look at a bold script
    with possibilities, you might consider this...\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/moonshine-script-nf/moonshine-script-nf/"

  body: Nick is right on the money... a lot of this work (that I have seen) was done,
    or emulated, the work of early 20th century engrossers. Lots of ornate scripts
    and drawn Roman caps... most reminiscent of the "modern" faces like the Bodonis
    which were shaded and shadowed and so on.

  body: "Maybe Jason could specify what era of Cuban cigar boxes he's shooting for?
    I walked past a tobbaconist yesterday (after reading this thread) and Cohiba,
    for instance, uses a bold grotesk, looking rather sixties-ey in its design. Montecristo
    has a lovely-looking minimalist crest. A lot of them seem to go for a slightly
    monumental \"engraved\" look.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cigar_brands#Cuba\r\n\r\nMight
    be a useful source of looks."
