  since the late 1930's, and my grandfather, who owns the nursery, was also a local
  politician for overy 20 years. \r\nI am interested in identifying the typeface that
  has more or less become the typographic identity of the nursery and my family's
  last name, D'ercole.  \r\n\r\nA family friend, I think a printer in NYC, must have
  chosen the face sometime in the '70s, and for whatever reason, everything D'ercole
  related ended up getting set in this ornamental typeface. \r\n\r\nIt's becoming
  a sentimental face for me, and I don't even know what it is, or where it came from.
  \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate anyone's input on identifying it!\r\n\r\nThanks.
  \r\n\r\n-Dan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dercole_4389.jpg]"
