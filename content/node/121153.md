  body: "I suggested Myriad over Frutiger mainly because the visible angle between
    terminals of |S| and stems of |H| and |I|: in Frutiger they\u2019re virtually
    parallel, while in Myriad they diverge in a more pronounced way."

    knock-off of Frutiger has a similar |S|, but not enough space between stem and

  body: "Myriad\u2019s |B| is much more rounded than the one on the sample (the bowls
    have little to no flat portion, top and bottom). That and the exclamation point
    led me to Frutiger:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Myriad_4257.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Frutiger_6469.png]"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nthanks to all for your input. I opted for Frutiger Cond Black
    now, which looks accurate in my eyese. I ruled out Myriad Pro too, being the default
    font of Illustrator. But I forgot to check Frutiger.\r\n\r\nThanks once more!\r\nC."
