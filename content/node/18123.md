  flyer I am designing for the summer reading club at my library. The theme for this
  year's club is Paws, Claws, Scales, and Tails. \r\n\r\nThis is all play right now,
  so no flyer or tickets yet.\r\n\r\nI guess I want to know first if you can read
  it easily. \r\nIt's display size only, and won't be used as a logo.\r\n\r\nAre the
  primary colors distracting? First character too angled? \r\n\r\nYour feedback is
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    me of a nursery. I can read them just fine.

    of the strokes look slightly different and you could include a line to join the
    two for a spine; and the giraffe should have more squarish spots. But nice friendly
    characters and easily readable to me.\r\nTim"

    out of the \"R\". The book spine needs to be angled and not so geometric. Make
    it more fluid with different thicknesses. Also, the smile on the mom/dad needs
    to be consistent with the kids smile.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Regal.gif]"

  body: I don't like my legs either. They look too flimsy. I just wanted to give you
    a rough idea of what I was thinking. I couldn't explain it in words. They really
    need to match the right-side legs as much as possible to look convincing.

  body: I question the black dots in the giraffe as there is no use of black in the
    other letters. I also question the split tail on the letter _a_ ... I don't quite
    understand that shape. The _e_  and the _a_ seem lighter than the _R_ and the
    _d_. The strokes which make up the book seem a little light as well.

  body: "I still don't like the book being so literal and everything else is so abstract.\r\n\r\nRight
    now it looks like the giraffe is melting to form the \"d\". I agree with Tiffany
    about the spots. It might not be neccessary. Since everything is abstract, I don't
    think it would be a bad idea to just make the \"d\" look like a \"d\" and add
    characteristics of a giraffe but putting the tail at the tail of the letter. Also,
    lower the stem of the \"a\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Regal6.gif]"

    needed, and abstract the book.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the giraffe has become
    to abstracted. The other animals anatomy seems in the right place. The d has been
    reduced to a giraffe head with a tail for a foot.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the kangaroo
    should be simplified as well.\r\n"

    are better in your small representation although now I see they do affect the
    counter of the d.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I really like the feel of your latest version of this. I think it may benefit
    from making use of two small adjustments which are seen in Tom's versions:\r\n\r\n1.
    thicker strokes on the mouths of the adult and child.\r\n\r\n2. create more of
    a diagonal in the book spine. Right now it looks a bit noncommittal. It looks
    like it's meant to be verticle and is slightly at an angle on accident.\r\n\r\nGreat
    job!"
