body: "Speaking of undervalued/underrated typeface, has anybody ever tried Quadriga
  Antiqua by Berthold? The typeface was designed for photocomposition in the late
  70's and is historically based on a \"Dutch Antique and Cursive\" type cut in Berlin
  in early Eighteenth century. The roman shapes are related to the Garamond model,
  while the italic has a very strong handwritten touch (but unfortunately, it misses
  the old style figures in the only digital version available).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quadriga_6525.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore

    guess that's why the fonts looks bad. This is a a portion of the 1979 catalogue:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quadriga_3929.jpg]"
