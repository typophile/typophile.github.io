  tweaking bits here and there balancing everything. Still haven't decided yet on
  the style of the serifs and probably some characters will change... for example
  I'm seriously considering a trapezoidal \u0414 instead of the triangular one I currently
  have, I don't like al the white space around it.\r\n\r\nPlease comment, critique,
  suggest.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2013-01-24

    body: "Hello catharsis and thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nThe defect at the
      top right corner you are referring to seems like the direction arrow in FL,
      I assure you the serifs are completely symmetrical and the top left side is
      ok )\r\n\r\nRegarding the arms of \"a\" and \"r\": they follow the shape and
      weight of \"n\". As far as I have read somewhere those curves are born from
      the \"n\" and share its characteristics. Am I right or should I tweak those
      curves to my liking disregarding the curve of \"n\"? The terminals are something
      I'm stil figuring out so don't consider them as a final version, but kudos for
      pointing that out )\r\n\r\nI'm gonna try your suggestion of making \"B\"s cleavage
      deeper. \"E\"s middle bar may be needing some shortening as you suggest, something
      like \"F\"s, although long middle arms in E do exist. Gotta study the possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"k\"'s
      foot is fixed already ) "

      letters seem to have different widths. Try comparing \"h\" and \"f\" stems.\r\n\"Ss\"
      - doesn't look good because \"s\" spine is about to have its widest part in
      the middle.\r\nIn cyrillic set i personally have problems with \"\u0414\u0434\"
      and \"\u0423\u0443\". \r\n- Slanted bar on top of \"\u0414\u0434\" doesn't seem
      appropriate at all to me.\r\n- \"\u0414\" and \"\u041B\" come in pair so you
      just cannot leave triangular \"\u041B\" when making \"\u0414\" trapezoidal.\r\n-
      I don't think that two-sided serif on the \"\u0423\" lower terminal is a good
      solution. Also there should be a similarity between uc and lc terminals of the
      same letter and i don't think it's ok to use 2 totally different types of terminals.\r\n"

    you have pointed out no longer apply since I have made a lot of changes to the
    typeface, I will try to post an updated preview soon.\r\n\r\nAs for the slanted
    \"\u0414\"... I designed that letter this way as a cross between the triangular
    and trapezoidal one, a little bit of innovation or creative freedom, if you prefer.
    Slanted \u0414\u0434's and \u041B\u043B's are one of the characteristics of this
    particular font, something that differentiate it from the rest, so I don't see
    myself changing it in the near future. Besides, I have only received positive
    critique for those two glyphs from people who has seen printed tests... you are
    the first russian to dislike those glyphs =)\r\n\r\nRegards!"

    shorter.\r\nAs I said in another post, I believe in this same thread, this font
    doesn't use any currently available font as a starting point. My inspiration came
    from some soviet lettering (all cyrillic caps) and I had to adapt everything to
    the latin script (both upper and lowercase) as well the lowercase cyrillic. It's
    been an interesting exercise because, as you told me yourself, usually designers
    begin drawing the lowercase letters and then the uppercase ones, and not the other
    way.\r\n\r\nOf course, during the making and re-making of some glyphs I have checked
    lots of fonts for inspiration )\r\n\r\nAnd some other characters. I'm not liking
    the \"pound\" one as it is right now. I will try a curved version I guess. Also
    the serif in the ampersand is not very orthodox (I believe), but I like the detail
    nevertheless.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen Shot 2013-02-17

    middle spines of \u0417 and \u0437 are spindly, try extending them a bit and maybe
    flattening off their ends. Also try mixing Latin and Cyrillic together: v\u0433e\u0436\u0437s\u0445,
    pt\u0431e\u0444g\u0439. Some rogue will probably do this, and it helps if your
    design anticipates it. You will discover that e.g. the base of s is too thin in
    such a context, and this will matter because there is a Cyrillic letter \u0455
    that should have largely the same appearance."

  body: "It seems to me like you have a few different styles and tendencies that are
    all jostling for primacy. For example, the terminal on /c/ doesn't resemble the
    one on /f/ doesn't resemble the one on /g/ doesn't quite resemble the one on /r/.
    You can make each terminal unique, of course, but some of these just don't seem
    thematically related enough to belong in the same font. Terminals are a large
    part of what gives a font its distinct identity and I think an organized approach
    to them is a hallmark of a font that works well. The serif on the bottom of /L/
    is different from the one on the bottom of /E/. Also contrast /p/ and /n/, looking
    at the spot where the vertical stroke joins the top of the bowl. They're totally
    different shapes, and another important part of giving the font its character
    is the shaping of the curves. The form of the serif is by comparison minor, since
    it doesn't really show up too well at text sizes. Obviously it's important to
    get the right shape for the serif, but at least to me, that doesn't seem like
    as big a deal as the issues of shapes and terminals. \r\n\r\nI can't see a lot
    of detail in this latest image, so I can't say as much as I'd like about the Cyrillic,
    but I do think the inside point of the /\u0417/\u0437/ should come over a lot
    further to the left, and the lc /\u0444/ is much too wide. UC /\u0423/ and lc
    /\u0442/ are also probably too wide, and in this font the /\u0431/ would probably
    be better off with the more humanist form (see Minion, for example). The hybrid
    /\u0414/\u0434/\u041B/\u043B/ still seem weird to me (though much better than
    those bizarre-looking diagonal-topped ones), but a native reader could opine more
    authoritatively. The roman is a bit better worked out, aside from the thematic
    and shaping issues I mentioned, but the /s/ could still use some work. Its left
    curve is too pointy, and the whole letter might just be too wide. The four-way
    join in the /k/ probably shouldn't be so chunky (that is, I'd reduce it to a point
    that just kisses the stem). And the very pointy points on /V/W/Z/v/w/z ought to
    get blunted.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd work on making all the letters look more like
    they came from the same font, and I'd work on matching up the thicknesses optically
    (compare the hairline of /e/ with the hairline of /s/)."
