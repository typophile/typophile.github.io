    these signages for the NYC subway were hand-drawn/hand-painted. \r\nA list of
    font that could be used to reproduce these letterings (mixing them sometimes to
    recreate original inconsistency): Driver Gothic, Agency, Aldrich, Solano Gothic,
    Refrigerator Deluxe, Strassenbahn, Raleigh Gothic, Korolev, Tempus Gothic, Nomad,
    Cougher, DIN Engschrift, Van Condensed, SNV, Cst Berlin and West, Saa, Sign Kit,
    Inventory, Signal, Highway, Route 66, Outer Loop\r\nJeff Levine has some interesting
    digitizations of signage fonts.\r\nSome previous discussions related to this topic:
