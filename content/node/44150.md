body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/restoring_button_5208.gif]\r\n\r\nI need
  to match this font EXACTLY in order to tie into an existing website.\r\n\r\nI've
  used Whatthefont? and Indentifont, and still not certain what I have here.\r\n\r\nThe
  closest match I've found is ITC Golden:\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_golden_type]]\r\n\r\nBut
  Golden seems a little too bold compared to the sample.\r\n\r\nWhat say you, Typophiles?"

    optimized for web will be good? \r\n\r\n(Am trying to resist the urge to tell
    you to scrap all this website's graphical text and install dynamic image replacement
    scripts.)  (Oops, I failed!)  ;)\r\n\r\nPS-Have you checked horrible free font
    rip-off sites?  If it's a non-profit on a tight budget, there's a good chance
    that's the source....\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: The sample needs to be larger in size-difficult to make out the detail of
    the letters.

  body: The sample looks like a dead ringer for <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=JENA10010010">Adobe
    Jenson Pro Semibold</a> to me. Jenson Pro is included with many versions of Adobe
    CS, making it even more likely to be the font in your sample.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/online_3868.png]

  body: Good catch. I was looking at the Adobe Jenson specimen book in my husband's
    office and remembered this thread. I'd say Adobe Jenson is the correct answer.
