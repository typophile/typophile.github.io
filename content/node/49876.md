    in \"Gent\" and \"Antwerp\"\r\n\r\nhere's the link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.copyrightbookshop.be/\r\n\r\nwhen
    you're two days in belgium it might be cool to visit Gent or Antwerp, especially
    antwerp so you have a chance to go see the \"Plantin Moretus museum\" A MUST see
    for everybody thats into type. (link)\r\n\r\nhttp://museum.antwerpen.be/plantin_Moretus/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.trabel.com/antwerp-plantin.htm"

    (been there two or three times) and yes, the Plantin-Moretus Museum is an absolute
    treat (especially in spring, when the roses bloom in the inner garden).\r\nUnfortunately,
    this time I'm \u201Conly\u201D going to Brussels \u2014 and I hoped someone like
    Yves could give me one or two addresses there."
