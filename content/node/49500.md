  am looking for a font which refers to a genuine greek typographic style \u2013 if
  that makes sense \u2026 :)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea?"

    You will find something similar (eg. Bodoni Classic and Gazis from the 18th century
    fonts).\r\n\r\nI don't understand though who (and how) came up with the name Bekkariana?\r\n\r\nGeorge

  body: "May I quote \xBBKeeping Greek Typography Alive\xAB by Yannis Haralambous:\r\n\r\nA
    good friend and colleague of ours at ENST de Bretagne, Prof. Ioannis Kanellos,
    has started an initiative against this trend, by giving us the opportunity to
    modelize the typesetting of a very important collection of books : the Aristotelian
    Collected Works by the German scholar Bekker of the Academy of Leipzig. \r\nThe
    typeface used in these books, and especially in the earlier volumes, is a pure
    masterpiece of 18th-19th century Greek typefaces. It has practically no ligatures
    ( besides omicron-upsilon and sigma-tau ) but keeps the manuscipt style of earlier
    Greek typefaces. The placement of accents is amazingly dynamic : in some cases,
    an accented letter seen out of context seems to be completely wrong. The same
    letter seems completely natural in the context of a word. \r\nWe hope that this
    typeface, called  \xBBBekkeriana\xAB in honour of Bekker, will contribute to the
    revival of older Greek typefaces and bring the Greek audience closer to part of
    the ( typographical ) history of its language. \r\n\r\nhttp://omega.enstb.org/yannis/\r\n\r\nhttp://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/thessaloniki.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: And thanks for the link to the Greek Font Society. I already knew them and
    appreciate their work a lot, but their fonts doesn't refer to old greek typesetting.
    Obviously Bodoni isn't a greek typeface ;)

  body: "It is a category mistake to think that Bodoni Greek reflects \u2018old Greek
    typesetting\u2019 any more or less than does the typeface used in Bekker\u2019s
    Aristotelis Opera. A typeface is Greek because it is designed to set the Greek
    language. Many of the great type designers, Bodoni included, cut Greeks for academic
    works which are no more or less authentic than Bekkeriana. \r\n\r\nBekker\u2019s
    Aristotle editions were printed in Berlin in the early nineteenth century and
    the use of the particular Greek typeface reflect the tastes of their time and
    the place of printing (and, perhaps even more importantly, the availability of
    type) as much as the use of any roman typeface. Bekkeriana closely resembles the
    cursive Greek cut in the late eighteenth century by Alexander Wilson of Glasgow
    \ (which has been digitized by Matthew Carter). Like Bodoni, Wilson was a punchcutter
    in the romantic tradition.\r\n\r\nBekkeriana reflects \u2018old Greek typesetting\u2019
    only to the extent that it is an old typeface that was designed to set Greek,
    and its original is much more likely to have been produced on the shores of the
    North Sea than the Aegean. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Incidentally, the Junicode font for medievalists designed by Peter Baker now
    contains a 'beta' version of a new digitization of Wilson's Greek, which I think
    you'll find has a very similar feel to Bekkeriana. See pages 3-4 of [[http://inamidst.com/stuff/archive/Junicode.pdf|this
    pdf]]. Junicode is available at [[http://junicode.sourceforge.net/]].
