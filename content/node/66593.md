  something neither Typophile <em>nor MetaFilter</em> has, so we could innovate here.\r\n\r\nIt
  is difficult to set up properly, not least of all from a coding perspective, since
  it involves confusingly nested unordered lists. But for long threads, it makes the
  difference between \u201Ccomprehensible\u201D and \u201Cchatter.\u201D\r\n"

    to be very annoying, confusing, and jumbled. \r\n\r\nIf there were other functional
    amenities added to facilitate more comprehensive quoting and comment-linking,
    as have been suggested elsewhere, then I think this would suffice to improve the
    flow of long, diverse conversations.\r\n\r\nFurther, if this sort of threading
    feature is indeed difficult to set up properly, then why even expose this forum
    to that particular roadside bomb? "

    I much prefer to look at threads chronologically. If you feel that your post is
    more relevant to a post that was made several posts back, then you can quote that
    post or @-reply the poster.

  body: I agree with Kent, Lex, Florian, DrDoc & aluminum. :o) People are a bit more
    sophisticated on this forum and have managed nicely with chronological order,
    it just takes a smidge more time to personally address someone if needed. Use
    the 'cite' HTML tag if you're referencing a specific blurb...that works for me.

  body: If message threading is possible, and some people really want it, it could
    be a display option, but personally I do not want it. I like the cumulative and
    interweaving form of Typophile discussions, and I also like being able to respond
    to multiple previous messages in a single post, making connections as I go between
    the points made by various contributors. I've seen how threaded discussions work
    on Reddit, and what I see is potentially interesting discussions very quickly
    terminate as threads never generate the same critical mass as the glorious indiscretion
    of a good free-for-all.

    hard or impossible, but if you\u2019re doing that within <em>one thread</em> you
    still can. My point is that four topics about chamfered serifs interspersed in
    one <em>post</em> need to be separated out."
