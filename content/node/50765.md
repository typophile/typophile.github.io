    make something yourself. Maybe a mobile using letters from FF Extra*, with an
    illustration of something that starts with the given letter on it. Cuddly soft
    brainwashing.  :->\r\n\r\n* http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-extra/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    advice:\r\n\r\nDon't invest in cool design the first year or so. Get it used/borrow
    it. It all ends up puke stained, poop stained, smothered in banana, wet, and worn
    out. The first year or so is about utility. THEN worry about aesthetics/quality
    ;o)\r\n"

  body: "Hrant: I would like to, but I am woefully bad at any kind of handwork, other
    than typesetting and book stitching. But I'll think about it. Extra would be perfect,
    though, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nAs for investing in cool design - no, I don't intend
    on buying much of this myself; I'll simply register for it, as we've been partially
    supporting a lot of other people for a long time and I expect them to pony up
    :)"

    I would've suggested large sorts from wood type, but\r\nyou certainly wouldn't
    want her chewing on that stuff!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, actually I thought about using some old gnarly wood type I have (boxes
    of), but no matter how much cleaning I do it's going to be imbued with a weird
    mixture of blanket wash, lead dust, oil and rubber based inks and who knows what
    else. Maybe I'll save that for some sort of wall-mounted item.

  body: Snugfits has some cute little onesies. They have a pirate version that says,
    "Arr, surrender the boobie." which is hilarious. But <a href="http://www.snugfits.com/Rock-Roll-Baby/Skull-and-Crossbones.html">here
    is one</a> you might appreciate.
