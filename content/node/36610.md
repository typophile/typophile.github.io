    out what they were, I am wondering if T. E. Lawrence would have known them as
    that as it seems to be an American usage, although if any Brit knew it it would
    be a soldier or a biker.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\nKerning ouch :)"

    wrote it for my specimens in Indie Fonts 3: \r\n\r\n<em>The formal qualities of
    a typeface energize, facilitate and inform the typographic layout. Skilled typographers
    will leverage the attributes of judiciously chosen fonts to maximize the personality
    of the page, thereby standing out from the crowd. </em>\r\n\r\nAll 26 are covered
    up to the \"x\" in maximize, but I needed a few more letters for condensed and
    italics, and being an ad man from way back, had to close with a benefit (if not
    a call to action).\r\n"
