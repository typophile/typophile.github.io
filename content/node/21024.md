    target=\"new\">Bodoni No. 2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura-black/stencil-d/\"
    target=\"new\">Futura Black Stencil</a>. \r\nI'm not near my old photo-lettering
    specimens at the moment.\r\nPerhaps someone has a better match."

    but a quick search for 'stencil' yielded this font, which I'd never have found
    otherwise.\r\n\r\naltho it is in my old Expertype book as well."
