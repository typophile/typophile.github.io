  nice in its italic,\r\nyet I do not have a picture of it. Seems to me a modern Garamond
  interpretation or something\r\nlike this. Anyone there to help me?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot\r\nStefan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unbekannt_3665.png]"

  body: Thanks for the recommendation, Yves! Just bought a copy on Amazon, and I can't
    wait to read it when I return home from my present trip in India. Speaking of
    India, the vernacular type here is wonderful.

    the course of 3 trips working on a project for the BBC. Very lucky indeed!
