  bank knows what font their logo is, and it appears that not much thought went into
  the choice. Could not find a match on whatthefont.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As I said in the previous post, this likely predates digital fonts. It appears
    to have been cobbled together from a number of different sources, hand-drawn,
    then turned into an engraved plate or \"cut\" that could be used for printing.
    From the looks of your sample, at some point in the phototypesetting era photostats
    were made of a printed piece bearing the logo to create logo slicks. The quality
    is pretty low.\r\n\r\nMost of the base lettering is a form of type known at the
    time as Detroit Serif (that's a style classification, not a typeface name). The
    closest digital equivalent I could find--and it's not that close--is Dulcinea:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/vargusjohn/dulcinea-serif/\r\n\r\nThe
    B is based on historical fonts like Campanile and Tendril, which I found in the
    Cincinnati Type Foundry Specimen Book (15th edition, 1882). There is a digital
    version of Campanile, but Victorian is a better match to your sample:\r\nhttp://fontpro.com/campanile-font-15191\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Victorian/fonts/\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    if you want to recreate the existing logo digitally, you'll either have to assemble
    and adapt individual letters from the fonts listed above, or redraw and clean
    up the existing logo in Adobe Illustrator."

  body: Sorry for the duplicate post. When I came back to check if there had been
    any replies, I couldn't find my previous post anywhere. Figured I must have forgotten
    to click "post," so I posted it again. Thank you for your response!
