<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello, Im new to the forum and was curious if i could get some help and suggestions. For a type class I need to create a typographic expression of a chosen quote. I really want to do something both original and complementive to the quote.
·WHENCE DID THE WONDROUS MYSTIC ART ARISE·
OF PAINTING SPEECH·AND SPEAKING TO THE EYES?
THAT WE BY TRACING MAGIC LINES ARE TAUGHT·
HOW TO EMBODY· AND TO COLOUR THOUGHT?
—William Massey
I'm thinking of tying both the pentameter(iambic?) and also some sort of mechanical evolution of written word to printed type. Is this a good path? anything helps, I feel like Im hitting a clichéd wall.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think your idea of showing the evolution of written word to printed type is a great one. But I think, like most ideas, it's only an idea and you may not know if it's going to work until you actually try to "execute" the idea. I think if you post some visuals you will get a good response from the group here...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the background very much, the harmony of the color, too.
I think you could set all your quote (but the signature) with the two faces you used in the 3rd line (from the top) probably a Garamond and Futura.
What`s the format ?

<div class=commentbody>I disagree- the colored images are great, but using it as a background distorts the legibility of the whole piece. You have an interesting idea, but to me it looks more like it's about printed type than the progression from handwritten to print. Keep at it! </div>

<div class=commentbody>I didn't take in consideration that Mr. Mark Kelley wanted to show the progression from handwritten to print, eh eh, sorry. Anyway legibility is not communication, especially if you talk about calligraphy. So thanks for disagree, I think you pointed out his decision about what element is more relevant for his graphic. Maybe the first image on the left should be more related to "handwriting" than "architecture", and so on, to the right part. What do you think ?

<div class=commentbody>I do like the use of colour but to be honest I feel your missing what the speech, the language is about. I would concentrate on more of what the words and tone are trying to say. Strip back the colour and imagery and take it right back to the meaning.
Have you thought about setting the type in a simple understated sans serif, something like helvetica and playing with layering by printing on to tracing paper or rice paper? Are you trying to get the audience to engage with the meaning of the speech or the asthetics of the design? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, thank you all so much for your feedback it has been very helpful. With my teachers' help I have focused more on the visual to thought and speech aspect of the quote. I want to focus on the correllation of how we hear sound and see color. With sound we are limited to the possibilities that our own organs are capable of producing and yet we are able to speak an array of language and understand it, through the combination of sound, space and time. With the cmyk printer technology we are able to see many colors using only four colors. From the four colors are brains will translate the 4 channels into a singular color. So from that I hoping it will push me inot a more dynamic design.This is were Im at so far. I have had no weekend, I have given it to type. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure that adding colour and images serves the meaning of the quote.
It seems to me Massey is saying that the written line manages, in black and white simplicity, to provide the richness of ideas and thought. To take "colourful thought" literally distracts from the more complex way it works in the quote. Perhaps I'm off.
I would suggest an expression which is -- not simple, but -- more focused on the lines of the letters and text to make the quote *do* what it says. Perhaps use colour in the actual letter shapes, rather than around it. Or if you want images, make them lighter, more of a background -- secondary to the text.

<div class=commentbody>So here is the latest attempt. I’m working with the idea of how we learn things, by adding smaller peices to create a larger whole. I felt as the computer was beginning take over, so i decided to print out the letters then cut them up and string togther. I’m focusing on the stacking idea of both visual and audible learning. I’m might also be using this on my x-mas tree instead of popcorn……[img:sites/default/files/old-images/webver.jpg]</div>
