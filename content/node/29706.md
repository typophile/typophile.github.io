  body: "There is a soft cover edition of Principles of Marketing. It might prove
    useful, it is principles after all.\r\n\r\nThen maybe some consumer behaviour
    and customer relationship management. I haven\u2019t read many books but along
    with Kotler you might want to check Solomon and Gupta & Lehmann."

  body: <em>Branding with Type</em> has a specifically typographical perspective,
    although it is getting a bit dated.

  body: "@Grot: lol there is also an international version but im too picky to buy
    it. I might just get the softcover but i guess there are other differences as
    well to safe printing costs.\r\n\r\n@Linda: I couldn't find any info about it
    on amazon. But it was selling for 99 cents in very good condition so i bought
    it anyway.\r\n\r\n@shoebacca: what do you like about the book? Is it a marketing
    book?"

  body: "For 99 cents, I would have too!  ;-)\r\n\r\nIf you want something a little
    more academic, you might want to look at some of Daniel Kahneman's work: he was
    a co-winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize for Economics.  Not specifically \"marketing,\"
    but as a psychologist, he looks at how human behaviour rationalizes economic outcomes.\r\n\r\nIMO,
    one of the neatest thing about his work isn't just that (surprise, surprise!)
    human beings aren't rational, but *how* they aren't rational, and how that impacts
    judgements and subsequent actions. Not exactly a light read, but pretty interesting
    stuff."

    They\u2019ve just changed dollars to euros and some of the examples are from Europe.
    Some are from the States."
