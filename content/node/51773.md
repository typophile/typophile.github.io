    has revived as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/dutch-mediaeval/|Dutch
    Mediaeval]]. Note that the initials include an S that resembles the one in the
    sample, although the fax/scan artifacts are hard to guess.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: 'Hummm pretty conviencing.. I usually just what your illustrating to check
    it out.. the "Chunk" out of the Right side of the R made me think its something
    different right off almost had an americana sort of look to me but I think you
    might be right.. is the upper angle on the G correct.. i.e. the downward tilt? '

  body: There's clearly a lot of distortion going on, so I don't trust little details
    (like the angles of the serifs) as much as the overall proportions and weight
    distribution.
