body: "I've got something that has to be set in InDesign CS in a \"typewriter\" font
  to mimic typing in the old days, which includes using the underscore to indicate
  italics (old timers like me remember actually doing that, on a real typewriter).\r\n\r\nIt
  happens the typewriter font I'm using, suitably battered, has a matching underscore
  (suitably battered, that is). Those who remember manual typewriters will recall
  how the underscore key was never quite aligned, so that the resulting underline
  was kind of wobbly, or saw-toothed. I need that effect.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I can't
  figure out how to place the underscore under the letters (there's a lot of passages).
  On the typewriter is was easy: you just ran the carriage back and typed the underscore--rat-tat-tat-tat-tat.
  How do you do this in InDesign? There must be a simple way that somehow eludes me.
  Using the underline feature is no good, as it doesn't access the underscore character,
  even through the stroke options palette (even a suitable custom stroke would seem
  to be impossible to create, at least in CS1).\r\n\r\nOne solution, failing keyboard
  manipulatoin, would be to open the font up in Fontlab, add an understroke to each
  character, and save the result as the  \"italic\" font to be used where needed (EULA
  permitting, of course). Funny that \"typewriter\" fonts don't come with one of these
  ready-made (let me know if you know of one that does). <!--break-->"

  body: "\x7FNot that it'd be a whole lot easier but could produce more random results
    (what you want) than just making a font:\r\n\r\nSince it's a typewriter font you
    should be able to reasonably assume the location of any character on a page if
    you were, say, given a bounding box, the text that contains it, and its index
    in the text.  Then you could place the underscore characters in individual text
    boxes and then jostle them about.\r\n\r\nIf InDesign scripting is as capable as
    Illustrator's then it should be pretty possible to just set a style that changes
    the color of the underlined text to red, and then before printing you could run
    the script, which would identify the red text and understand to place the underscores.\r\n\r\nBut
    all this depends on a few things: that the font is perfectly fixed-width and that
    InDesign's scripting is as capable as I would hope to think it is.  But writing
    the script would only really be feasible if there are a high number of pages each
    needing the underline.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

  body: "Thanks Matthew for the ideas. Unfortunately scripting isn't my forte, so
    I think it will be quicker for me to make an underline font in FontLab. I don't
    need all the characters--just plain a-z, A-Z, numbers and some punctuation.\r\n\r\nJames:
    It's pretty much impossible I've found to authentically replicate the look of
    an old typewriter with an underinked ribbon in digital type. A lot of the distressed
    typewriter fonts look like a photocopy of a typewritten page when printed. Usually
    I just need a couple of lines, in which case I just bash it out on my real typewriter,
    scan it, and place it as a half-tone image."

  body: I'd make a separate text box that has a bunch of underscore characters that
    match up with your underscored text (don't forget to fiddle with minor baseline
    shifts and some even more minor character width and height adjustments to give
    it an authentic look), and then just overlay it on your original text. Clumsy,
    but it should work.

  body: "You didn't say how long is the copy and how much time you have, I think I'd
    paste-in-palce the empty text box in a new layer and use the space and the underscore.\r\nIt's
    a good idea your underscored \"italic\" for that."
