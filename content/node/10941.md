  body: 'That&#39;s hilarious. I can just imagine the person with the tatoo wandering
    around and periodically being accosted on the street by typographers: &#39;Did
    you know, that A is backwards?&#39; <BR> <BR>I used to photograph backwards and
    upsidedown letters &#40;A and X are the most common&#41;, but gave up when I realised
    just how many examples there are. My favourites were always the ones that were
    really permanently installed, preferably in some very expensive and difficult
    to correct medium, e.g. carved in stone on the side of a pretenious menswear shop.
    One of the best has to be in Brompton Oratory in London: there is a text in gigantic
    brass letters running around the inside of the base of the dome, and one of the
    X&#39;s is upsidedown.'
