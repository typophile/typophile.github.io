    no digital version.

    looks like a pretty close recreation of this same typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "You use the lower case to get alternate forms, but it's unicase otherwise,
    if that means all the same height. For LEE MORGAN, I used the l.c. e, m, a and
    n.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike - yes, I have a worn copy of the 8th edition (1980).\r\n\r\nLoudine
    seems to borrow from both Deutsch Black and Glyphic, but is not a match to either.
    It's probably as close as you can get digitally, though."

  body: "<em>did you really (I suspect) whip this out in 11 days or less? </em>\r\n\r\nYou
    suspect correctly; the task was lightened by the fact that this particular design
    required only a small number (338) of kerning pairs, even including kerning caps
    following lowercase letters because of variant letterforms in the lowercase positions."
