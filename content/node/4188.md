  body: 'Hrant scripsit: <i>How he balances personal expression versus what his users
    want/need.</i> <BR> <BR>Perhaps this should be a separate thread, since this probably
    isn&#39;t going to help Ricardo very much, but here goes... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m bothered
    by this dichotomy that you keep trying to assert, Hrant, between expression &#40;elsewhere
    explicitly associated with individual, artistic expression; usually in reference
    to type designers as &#39;artistes&#39;&#41; and a kind of functionalism focused
    on readability. I&#39;m bothered because the whole notion that art = expression
    is a modern, debased romaniticism. I say debased, because it is the romanticism
    of <i>Drawing on the right side of the brain</i>: a kind of fantasy of democratic
    creativity that is measured solely by quantity of expression of self. This is
    a view of art that is singularly useless for any kind of cultural dialogue, which
    explains why your dichotomy is unanswerable. &#39;Expression&#39; is a straw man,
    especially since the modernism which you otherwise claim to despise propagandises
    functionalism against romantic expression. [Note that I think the modernist view
    of functionalism is itself inherently romantic, i.e. fantastical. As C.S. Lewis
    wrote of literature: &#39;...the canon of &#39;functionalism&#39; has disabled
    literature for half its functions.&#39; I think much the same can be said of your
    obsessions regarding readability: by making this the sine qua non of type design
    -- despite the very obvious evidence that readability is the simplest function
    of typography to achieve -- you diminish the total functionality of type.] Who
    will step forward to defend expression against the user&#39;s &#39;needs&#39;?
    Not I, nor, I suspect, anyone else. <BR> <BR>But someone might step forward to
    defend another view of art: an older and more sophisticated view in which the
    individual expression exists as an unavoidable byproduct of the process of making.
    So, Persian miniature painters equated individual style with a flaw: the error
    that reveals the hand. This is an extreme view, but something not dissimilar is
    found in Orthodox icon writing, and even in the Western tradition prior to Romanticism.
    It is a view expressed in the statement &#39;The art is more important than the
    artist&#39;, i.e. that what matters is the creative integrity of what is made,
    not the creative expression of the maker. This is very much the spirit in which
    I approach type design, and in which the popular romantic distinction of art from
    craft is meaningless &#40;as it was in the Middle Ages&#41;. This is not to say
    that there is no individual expression in my type design, but that it exists there
    only by default of the fact that I, and not another person, am the person struggling
    to make a particular thing. The particularity of the made thing determines its
    characteristics much more than the personality of the maker, which must sometimes
    be actively supressed in order to achieve integrity. I might like a particular
    form of a letter, or part of a letter, but the only thing that matters in the
    making of a typeface is whether that form is appropriate to the whole. The whole
    is defined by a particular balance of many things: functional, aesthetic, cultural
    and, yes, personal, which must be in some kind of balance -- and there are many
    ways to balance them -- if the whole is to be integrated. <BR> <BR> <BR>[Note:
    the above is the first time I&#39;ve tried to put some of these thoughts into
    words, so I don&#39;t claim it is a really solid expression. Also, these are nor
    theoretical ideas, i.e. they do not intellectually precede the work; rather, they
    are an attempt to define, exterior to the work, what the work itself expresses.
    This is remarkably difficult.]'

  body: 'The dichotomy is very real, but it&#39;s not really expression versus readability.
    To me the dichotomy of the self versus society is the single most important thing
    about being human. And in a craft such as type design &#40;versus an art such
    as tableau painting&#41;, one has to worry more about the wants and needs of <i>users</i>,
    and this is certainly not limited to readability. <BR> <BR>&#62; modernism which
    you otherwise claim to despise propagandises <BR>&#62; functionalism against romantic
    expression. <BR> <BR>And Americans claim they&#39;re helping the Iraqis. I&#39;m
    a lot less interested in what modernism pretends &#40;or even thinks&#41; it&#39;s
    doing, versus the effect it has on the ground &#40;for example reducing cultural
    authenticity and variety&#41;. BTW, I don&#39;t &#34;despise&#34; modernism -
    more than anything I pity it. <BR> <BR>&#62; an older and more sophisticated view
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;re simply talking about the reality that neither art nor craft
    exist in a pure state - for example that even a tableau painter can often have
    a paying client who has certain wants of his own. This in fact fits in perfectly
    with the dichotomy above. <BR> <BR>And when you make a typeface, you neither can
    banish expression nor do you want to - but you also don&#39;t want to apply expression
    for its own sake, to seek a means of &#34;venting&#34; - that&#39;s Art. So it
    reverts again to the most important thing: <i>intentions</i>, not results. <BR>

  body: 'Hrant, I spent a long time carefully trying to put into words my approach
    to the making of type, in order to demonstrate that your dichotomy of artistic
    expression vs. user needs is inadequate and based on presuppositions on the nature
    of art. You respond by telling me that I am &#39;simply talking about the reality
    that neither art nor craft exist in a pure state&#39;, and go on to restate the
    same presupposition on the nature of Art, this time capitalising it to reinforce
    your point. You do this despite the fact that I was not &#39;simply&#39; stating
    anything: I was trying to get at something that is anything but simple, and I
    certainly wasn&#39;t saying what you think I was saying. You are so focused on
    the relationship of &#39;self versus society&#39;, that you completely miss what
    I spent a long paragraph discussing, which is the relationship of maker to thing
    made: that what matters most is neither the demands of the individual nor of society,
    but the demands of the thing itself, which define its integrity. Instead, you
    come back and criticise my &#39;particular separation of Art and Craft&#39; when
    I explicitly said that my approach made no such separation; whereas you have frequently
    and loudly made a separation between craft &#40;good&#41; and Art &#40;bad&#41;
    in type design. You then go on to make the delusional claim that you &#39;do a
    great job of extracting both literal as well the &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; insight&#39;
    from everything that you read. On the contrary, I have frequently had to point
    out your willful incomprehension, noting the irony that someone so obsessed with
    the lower level cognitive processes of reading should be so poor at the higher
    level comprehensive processes of understanding. I strongly suspect that your commitment
    to always finding a &#39;behind-the-scenes&#39; insight in what you read actually
    prevents you from comprehending plain statements: you always believe that people
    are saying what you imagine them to be saying, regardless of what they actually
    say. I think you are in this respect quite mad. Communication is only possible
    in the context of shared meaning: if you are always second-guessing everything
    that I write, you can&#39;t blame me for getting frustrated and giving up. You
    only want to have a conversation with yourself, and I&#39;m tired of having my
    words misinterpreted in order to furnish content for that conversation, especially
    when, as today, I have spent a long time struggling to to find those words. Finally,
    of course, you are incapable of ending your response without a characteristic
    personal insult, in which my objection to your very obvious failure to grasp what
    I have written about -- obvious because nowhere in your response do you allude
    once to that relationship that is central to my thesis -- is characterised as
    escapism. Then I am challenged to &#39;try an once of self-doubt for a change&#39;.
    This from a man who claims insight bordering on omniscience: to be able to extract
    both literal and &#39;behind-the-scenes&#39; meaning from <i>anything</i> that
    he reads. Sir, where is <i>your</i> self doubt? And this after I have postscripted
    my thoughts with the acknowledgement that they are not a really solid expression,
    and represent the first steps in trying to put into words the largely intuitive
    principle under which I go about making type.'

    no other good explanation for the constant attention you pay to anything I happen
    to utter. I&#39;m <i>sure</i> there are other people posting things you don&#39;t
    agree with, but they don&#39;t seem to get nearly as much attention... I know
    you hate my constant referral to serious flaws in your cherished culture and script,
    but you need to reclaim the necessary objectivity, the self-control, so you can
    stop wasting time hunting me down. It&#39;s really not worth it. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Hrant, I engage you in discussion because you make unfounded claims in public
    fora, and I&#39;m enough of a believer in the necessity of public discourse to
    call you on these. In the case of this thread, I responded because you prompted
    me to think about why the dichotomy you propose doesn&#39;t make sense and why,
    in particular, it doesn&#39;t apply to the way I work. I&#39;m now coming to the
    conclusion that you are not interested in public discourse, but only in the sound
    of your own voice. Whatever anyone else says to you gets translated into that
    sound and played back distorted. I have corrected your interpretation of my ideas
    and the ideas of others many times. Numerous people better informed than either
    of us have corrected your misconceptions about e.g. Noordzij&#39;s ideas. And
    yet you persist in the same misinterpretations and misconceptions, without even
    bothering to engage with the objections or counter their points. This is either
    stupidity or willful refusal to accept any external voices. <BR> <BR>Now, when
    I talk about the demands of a <i>thing</i> -- a fully material thing: a typeface
    -- you think I&#39;m talking about abstraction. Then, after I have explicitly
    indicated doubt about the ideas I have put forward -- about their tentativeness
    and the problems of their relationship to practice --, you repeat this bizarre
    refrain that I lack doubt. Again, you are operating solely within your imagination,
    and not engaging at all with the content of what I write. And you have the nerve
    to suggest that I &#39;focus on the discussion&#39;. There is no discussion! I
    spent a long time carefully phrasing discussion, and all I got back from you is
    misreading, avoidance and insults that have absolutely nothing to do with what
    I wrote. <BR> <BR>Nick at least seems to understand what I&#39;m getting at.'

  body: 'This has become so bizarre, that I had to go back and carefully re-read what
    I wrote in my first long message. There really isn&#39;t anything in it, Hrant,
    to which your response makes any sense: there is no &#39;compartmentalizing and
    categorizing&#39;, there is no &#39;separation of Art and Craft&#39;, there is
    no &#39;abstraction&#39;. You are the one talking in abstractions -- self vs society
    --: I am talking about a person in the act of making something. I can&#39;t think
    of anything less abstract.'

    <BR> <BR>I much prefer Plato&#39;s Philosopher King.  Then again decadence strikes
    every system.  We all march relentlessly towards entropy. There is no &#34;System.&#34;  There
    is only a steady progression towards the ultimate order of total randomness which
    will then quickly begin the next singularity and its explosion to once again seek
    entropy.   <BR>:-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Entropy&#34;! Now that is a great name for
    a typeface--perhaps a multiple Master with an infinite number of axis.  Perhaps
    it is the ultimate Grunge face--the letterforms would degrade as you typed until
    you had an even yet unordered spread of glyph fragments all over your page.  That
    would be a feast for any PostScript RIP. <BR> <BR>So, we have made the journey
    back to the singularity of typography--and they said you cannot escape a black
    &#40;w&#41;hole. <BR> <BR>Chris'
