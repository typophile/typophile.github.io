    were already present in code pages (863, 850, 858 and Windows 1252) before 1991,

  body: "Presumably so. One of the Unicode principles is to have backwards compatibility
    with pretty much all pre-existing character sets. So plenty of things that would
    not otherwise be encoded, get encoded through that \"back door\" principle. Spacing
    versions of diacritics that don't dynamically combine are likely yet another example
    of this.\r\n\r\nPrecomposed accented characters are one such thing. So are ligatures.
    For both, only the ones that existed pre-Unicode got encoded.\r\n\r\nThere are
    fascinating political issues around this. For example, there are folks for whom
    Tamil is a native language, who want it to work without dynamic accent composition,
    with precomposed accented characters. But there wasn't a standard Tamil encoding
    prior to Unicode, so Unicode didn't do Tamil that way (and will never do so),
    hence standard text processing architectures based on Unicode require that Tamil
    be treated as a complex writing system, like Arabic or Tibetan. This means that
    antique apps that don't use the right APIs don't work with \"proper\" Unicode
    Tamil\u2014but could have if it wasn't a complex writing system. Such old apps
    and operating systems are pretty nearly dead here in the USA, but are much more
    common in India and south Asia...."

    else would there be a free-standing cedilla in Latin-1?\r\n\r\nCurrent use? Well,
    the backtick (U0060) is used in Unix shells when you want to assign the output

  body: "I too think they're legacy characters, for backwards compatibility. Since
    we only set books (new publications), I take them out of all the fonts we modify
    for our use (usual disclaimers about following the EULAs). However, I do make
    sure the spacing modifiers and combining diacriticals are populated, which is
    what Unicode expects for proper canonical composition/decomposition with diacriticals.
    BTW, I also remove any Unicode number from any ligatures.\r\n\r\nBy doing this,
    we do make sure the \"legacy\" doesn't continue with any manuscripts/files going
    out of our shop. I guess people making fonts for general use can't take this approach,
    someone would squawk.  Might be worth it, though. You'd get a .notdef for the
    removed accents, which could then be replaced by the proper Unicode character.\r\n\r\nSadly,
    another reason is very few font designers/publishers include the combining diacriticals
    and spacing modifiers. Maybe if these were actually included, the apps would be
    made to work as intended, and the problems Thomas mentions could gradually disappear.\r\n\r\nRead
    the Unicode section on Combining diacriticals sometime. What they expected people
    to do and what is actually done are two different things. Which means the general
    mess will continue... "

  body: "There are two reasons to have spacing accents in Unicode:\r\n\r\n1. A spacing
    accent is needed as metainformation. Let's say you have to show how is a caron.
    The easiest way to do this is... with a caron, of course. Although you can also
    use the combining diacritic preceded by spaces, this would wrest the use Unicode
    attributes to combining characters.\r\n\r\n2. Spacing accents are used as modifiers
    in linguistic and phonetic texts. They work to indicate tones, pauses, unions,
    stops, syllables, and other data to which the plain text is not enough.\r\n\r\nBackward
    compatibility is only the reason why some modifiers are out of the spacing modifiers
    block (02B0\u201302FF), but even without any backward policy these modifiers would
    be necessary to address cases 1 and 2 above."

  body: "Yes. Spacing modifiers -- the characters under their own \"name\" -- are
    sometimes needed. Problem is, the assignments noted by Mr. Belloc are mis-located
    as spacing modifiers. They seem to have a legacy purpose only.\r\n\r\ncircumflex
    should be at 02C6, not 005E\r\ngrave should be at 02CB, not 0060\r\nacute should
    be at 02CA, not 00B4\r\nmacron should be at 02C9, not 00AF\r\n\r\nApparently 00A8
    is all Unicode made available for the encoding of a \"spacing\" dieresis, the
    others I take out, for reasons given above.\r\n"
