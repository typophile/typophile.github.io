  body: "The _WOC_ logo may be handmade. The W from scratch: make half, mirror a copy
    and merge. The _OC_ can be made from any of several fonts. Here I used Monotype
    Century Schoolbook Bold\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/monotype-century-schoolbook/
    and made the letters bolder by using the parallel lines feature in Fontshop. Then
    I compressed to 80%. Finally I extended and widened the lower stroke:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OC_HeavyModified_4153.jpg]\r\nFairly
    close. More letters could be made using the same procedure and you would have
    a somewhat similar font.\r\nDon"
