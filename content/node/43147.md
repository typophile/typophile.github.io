body: "Our company recently redesigned a weekly publication and in that design we
  used a font called Sans Serif FLF - http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/r_z.htm
  - as a major part of it. Headlines, the logo, and many other features.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sansserif_5884.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is, we are dropping our old Type1 font library and converting to OT.  We
  have found out since then that this foundry is no longer in business and there's
  no more support for this font.  This leaves us with 3 scenarios that I can see:\r\n\r\n1)
  Leave the font as is, keep using the Type 1 and hope it lasts with no compatibility
  issues.\r\n\r\n2) Convert the font with a 3rd party program to OT.  Is there any
  way to quality control this or just hope there aren't any reflow issues?  Also continues
  us using an unsupported font.\r\n\r\n3) Redesign everything associated with the
  font with something we have or is readily available.  Problems with this is we lose
  the identity we just created with the old font and also trying to figure out what
  font could be a suitable replacement and give the same feel.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

  body: If you used a paid professional to do the conversion I'd say Option 2 is your
    best bet. In the short term it might seem more expensive than using a new font,
    but in the long term I think, if you think you need to stay with the old font,
    you'll be happy for the money spent.

    freshen things up a bit too. It seems you do like Sans Serif, so I'm not suggesting
    a totally new approach, but you might consider:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_ot/\">Proxima

  body: Thanks for the responses so far.  I kind of doubt a professional job is going
    to be in the budget.  If it were to happen it would be an in-house Fontlab job
    or something along those lines.  I noticed Futura Std 2 in our Font Folio package
    which seemed in my opinion a fairly good replacement, although the designer of
    the publication that chose the old font disagreed.

    \u2014 and it costs nothing but the time it takes to learn how to use it. (It
    works in the X11 environment.)\r\n\r\nI say this because your budget seems to
    be very tight \u2014 but I rather agree with Miss Tiffany that shelling out for
    a replacement font is by far the most sensible option (though you seem to have
    a designer who is digging his heels!)"

    doing a conversion?\r\n\r\nI suppose thats  a dumb question and would all be based
    on the quality of the conversion."

  body: If the UPM & The glyph width don't change then no. The other thing is maybe
    Richard Ware is still out there. He might be pleased to do the job. Aesthetically
    speaking I would concur with Tiff that the fonts she mentioned will very probably
    be of much higher quality.

  body: "As for reflow, it can be hard to say with certainty, but I'd agree with Eben
    Sorkin. That does leave kerning; if you were using Quark for example, and had
    any kerning beyond what was imported from the foundry font metrics, it will not
    be included in the new OT font unless you add it.\r\n\r\nIf there was no external
    kerning, all you need do is to make a kern feature for the OT version (and have
    at least one GSUB feature in case the font winds up being used with an older Adobe
    program).\r\n\r\nConceivably, if you combine two fonts into one, there could be
    some differences. For example, if you had a regular font and a separate \"expert\"
    font in Type 1 format, and now put those glyphs into a single OT font, there might
    be some differences with any kerning involving spaces. For example, if there was
    a \"space\"-\"a\" kern in the Type 1 expert set, but in using it, you put in a
    font change just after the space & before the \"a\", the kern probably wouldn't
    take effect. But if they are now in one font, and the \"a\" is small-capped by
    an attribute change, the kern would take effect. \r\n\r\nThink of it like this:
    essentially, a .otf opentype font is a just a wrapper around a PostScript font.
    You control the wrapper, and except for any GPOS features you might add, or fail
    to add, all the metrial data should stay the same.\r\n\r\nBut layout programs
    can have bugs too, so some small reflow changes just might occur. But if you change
    fonts there will certainly be reflow, so how big an issue can this be?\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "I think your first scenario (<em>Leave the font as is, keep using the Type
    1 and hope it lasts with no compatibility issues</em>) is reasonable for the time
    being.\r\n\r\nI know of only one current Type 1 compatibility issue: Type 1 fonts
    will not show up in the font menus of applications written to take advantage of
    the Windows Presentation Foundation, the graphical subsystem that ships with Windows
    Vista and can be installed on Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003. The earlier
    graphical subsystem, GDI, is still available under Vista, and applications using
    GDI still work. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, if you are not using Windows, compatibility
    issues are not yet a concern. If you are using Windows, compatibility issues will
    not be a concern until you acquire or upgrade to applications written for the
    Windows Presentation Foundation. Even then, if your publishing applications are
    from Adobe, there is a chance that Type 1 fonts will still be supported (see Thomas
    Phinney's blog: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2005/10/phasing_out_typ.html).\r\n\r\nI
    understand why you want to drop your old Type 1 font library, but I think you
    have plenty of time to decide whether scenario 2 or 3 is the better replacement
    option for the Casady and Greene San Serif. \r\n\r\nBy the way, you may have one
    more option, depending on your platform. Fluent Laser Fonts for Windows were issued
    in TrueType as well as Type 1. Instead of converting your Type 1 fonts, you could
    try to locate the existing TrueType versions, which will continue to work under
    Windows Presentation Foundation, \r\n "
