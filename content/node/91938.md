body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am trying to get more comfortable with vector editing
  software these days (Adobe Illustrator in particular) and I have sort of a workflow
  question.\r\n\r\nLet's say I'm trying to achieve a kinda extended letter \"o\" shape.\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/0.jpg\" alt=\"extended_letter_shape\">\r\n\r\nI
  would start with the outer vector path.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/1_61.jpg\"
  alt=\"extended_letter_shape\">\r\n\r\nI have seen some people combining a shape
  out of several other ones.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/2_49.jpg\"
  alt=\"extended_letter_shape\">\r\n\r\nBut when I have to place every part in it's
  exact place, I can't put them in exact spots where they need to be. As a result
  I end up with tiny overlappings and vector imperfections. This is what I <u>roughly</u>
  get:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/3_27.jpg\" alt=\"extended_letter_shape\">\r\n\r\nIt
  would be nice to know what would be your approach to such a task.\r\nWhat's the
  fastest way?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    no-fail easy out is to give the path a stroke with round corners, then convert
    the outline to an object: perfect tangents every time."

    this to an Illustrator forum (free at Adobe .com) '

  body: "Maybe you have activated Align to grid (View menu) or the hideous Align to
    pixel grid (Transform panel options).\r\n\r\nNow, vector drawing is not a lot
    like geometrical construction. I would rather do that by drawing a straight corner
    outline and then rouding the corners with the software."

  body: "First thing to add, you can scale up your vector graphic, making it easier
    to see the small joins etc. and then scale it back down.\r\n\r\nUse align pallet
    and groups- i.e. first two circles, group, second two (bigger circles) align and
    group. Align the two groups, make your shape from the centre using the pathfinder
    (divide, for example) and then use either the Effect>Stylize>Round Corners or
    the slightly more precise script \"Round Any Corner\" that can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/20-free-and-useful-adobe-illustrator-scripts/"

  body: "My approach when creating compound shapes like this in Illustrator is not
    to rely on what I see on the screen but to do some thinking first and work out
    some dimensions and create objects to these precise dimensions. Rounding off the
    dimensions makes it easier to do the sums (52mm rather than 52.84mm for example).\r\n\r\nThen
    I can use the Move function and/or x and y co-ordinates to position things accurately.
    In very complex shapes I also position the first shape in this way so that I know
    exactly where it is located within the artboard."

  body: "I guess this is an old thread, but\u2014\r\n\r\nI very rarely construct shapes
    out of primitives. I'll use primitives to make guides (View>Guides>Make Guides),
    and then I'll just draw my shape with the pen tool. If I really want it to be
    perfectly symmetrical, I'll draw half or a quarter of it and then flip it along
    its edge and combine using the Pathfinder.\r\n\r\nBasically what I'm saying is,
    don't be afraid of actually drawing."

    that can help with this.\r\n\r\n"
