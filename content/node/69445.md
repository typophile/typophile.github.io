  job selecting new typeface for it. It looks clean, restrained and contemporary.
  The question of course is what it is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bmw-mmi_4832.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Hmm, it is sure pretty close, but what confused me was that it looks rounded
    and somewhat condensed compared to Helvetica. Also the top curve of /a/s bowl
    seems different.

  body: Oh Ok I thought maybe the view was at an angle (thus condensing it a little).  Also
    the c at least isn't the same.

  body: "It looks like BMW's custom typeface BMW-Sans to me. This would make sense
    too as it is a key element of BMW's corporate identity. It was designed in 2002
    by Dalton Maag for Interbrand, closely related to Helvetica but with subtle differences
    including angled stroke termini which aren't parallel with the baseline. http://www.daltonmaag.com/portfolio/2002-2003
