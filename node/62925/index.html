<p>Would you even have folios?</p>
<p>Well, I would like them not for ordering but to hold it together. For example Page 1/3, Page 2/3, Page 3/3. It just makes me feel safer because an incomplete copy is clearly marked as incomplete.</p>
<p>The audience are recruiters who rush through resumes are an alarming pace. From what I can gather, their eyes track the page top-left to bottom-right and if they get distracted or did not see what they are looking for, its in the bin.</p>
<p>However, with such a short collection of pages, some folio positions just do not work. For example, if you bleed the right hand edge then Page 3/3 causes them to look for Page 4/3 and they get confused (witnessed it first hand). While that is not an immediate problem for most jobs, its clearly flawed and may reflect badly if applying for design-related jobs - so its in the bin.</p>
<p>So where should they go? :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It sounds like you have a much bigger problem with your design/hierarchy, something that folio placement isn&rsquo;t going to solve.</p>
<p>Also, a three page resume is probably two pages too long, especially if it&rsquo;s going to people who are just skimming them. Edit it down to something short and digestible.</p>

<p>Sometimes they OCR the document and use computers to scan for keywords. That&rsquo;s a problem that my thread is not addressing :)</p>
<p>Hi Jackson, could you please elaborate? I will confess to having too much to put in my resume. My last career advisor was really stuck and told me to take out education because it was the weakest part (I am postgraduate).</p>

<p>If people aren&rsquo;t taking the time to read everything on your resume, the solution isn&rsquo;t going to be adding more information (folios). You need to edit down (a lot) and make the information skim-able (by adjusting your typographic hierarchy).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure its easy in practice because statements must be substantiated with qualified examples.</p>
