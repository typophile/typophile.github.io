  font is used to write \"MASAHIRO (S)HINODA\" on [[http://www.asia-tik.com/images/stories/films/shinoda/pack1|this
  packaging]].\r\nI know this is a font because I have this DVD pack and it is used
  to write a lot of texts. \r\nAfter few search and with help on WhatTheFont Forum,
  it cames that Manfred Klein could be the author.\r\nFont as [[http://www.dafont.com/fr/crazycrazy.font?text=MASAHIRO+SHINODA|CrazyCrazy]]
  is very close but not a perfect match... Hope it helps...\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: I think this could be a customized <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=galliard&x=0&y=0&sample_text=MASAHIRO%20SHINODA&sample_size=36">ITC
    Galliard</a>. This is not really hard to -- just cut off serifs here and there.

  body: "You perfectly right about ITC Galliard.\r\nI\u2019m still convinded this
    is a font. Lot of texts are written with downer and special characters (\xE9,
    \xE8, \xE0...). It seems also that there is two weights, regular and bold and
    all text initials are caps and semi-serifs... So that\u2019s why I have concluded
    this is a font...\r\nIt is as ITC Galliard semi-serif has come to life..."
