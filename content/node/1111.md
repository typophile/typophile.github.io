  body: Which system? <BR>Which coding languages? <BR>Which software? <BR> <BR>The
    only thing that&#39;s always default is that its monospaced. <BR>Don&#39;t know
    about Mac&#39;s, but most script editors on proper computers just use Courier
    New. <BR>C&#43;&#43; and VB also use Courier New on my machine &amp; I don&#39;t
    recall changing it, so I guess that&#39;s default.

    Newton Toolkit, etc. under OS 9&#41;.
