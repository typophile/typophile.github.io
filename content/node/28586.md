body: I stumbled across this while looking for examples of typefaces used for the
  small, product information on packaging design. I know that the pictures are fuzzy,
  but any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I'm also interested to know
  if people think any particular typefaces lend themselves well to this type of usage.
  Thanks in advance.

  body: "Franklin Gothic of course - great range for prioritisation - super style
    and readability.\r\n\r\nI think this might be News Gothic however. In any case,
    look how wide the character spacing is and bear this in mind for small text. Probably
    more important than the choice of font in this case."

  body: Bell Centennial is cut for ink traps at small sizes - and manages to be rather
    stylish when used larger by a knowing eye.
