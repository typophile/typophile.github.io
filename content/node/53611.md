  article about the effects of branding.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://designobserver.com/archives/doentry38869.html\">Great
  article</a> on what common products need redesigning. My favorite one/the one I
  most agree with is #6 Political lawn signs. That's why I'm stoked to be working
  on a campaign team, designing logo, postcard, letterhead, etc. Should be interesting."
