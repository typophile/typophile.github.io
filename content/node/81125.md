body: "This is my first serious design, although I have been experimenting with font
  creators for a year or two. I would much appreciate any pointers you care to offer.
  At this point, I have formed all the Latin letters as well as several alternate
  forms for some, plus some of the punctuation and all the Latin-1 diacritics letters.\r\n<a

  border=\"0\" alt=\"Sample of unnamed typeface\"></a>\r\nI have also included a complete
  list of the glyphs in the face thus far.\r\n\r\nIt hasn't been kerned, hinted, etc.
  yet.\r\n\r\nEDIT: New version of PDF attached containing corrections to overshoots.
  I made the existing overshoot less extreme and added the ones I forgot."

  body: "My primary concerns at this point are:\r\n-Do you recommend including more
    diacritical letters, and if so, which ones?\r\n-Any ideas on a name for it? (I'm
    really bad at coming up with good names for stuff like this.)\r\n-I can't decide
    which of the following K arm joints works best, a corner or curves.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unnamed

  body: The lowercase overshoots are a bit odd. On the bottom, the "o" has none, but
    abdgpq do...

  body: Just looking quickly at the K - should the joint of the two strokes be rounded
    out too? Trying to look for other patterns of what is rounded and what is not.

  body: I tried the rounded approach on the second K, but it turned out rather awkward.
    I'm still not sure exactly how I'm going to address that one.
