  body: "Dada typographers used common fonts in f*cked-up layouts.\r\nSubsequent radical
    graphic designers have often used wack fonts as well.\r\nWould today's dadaists
    use prosaic typefaces such as Gotham?\r\nThat would be emulating the process,
    rather than imitating the historical artefact."
