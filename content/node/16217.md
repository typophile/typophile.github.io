  body: I just read about the creation of Gotharda, and it turns out the guy was looking
    for that old German look.  That's just what GM called that style they used, old
    German.  There must be an exact match out there somewhere!

    confirm this would be to find other GM material - advertising, manuals etc., which
    set other words in the same typeface. "

  body: As usual, this car badge would seem to be a custom creation. Still, Peter's
    suggestion of Element is the closest I know of. Check out Gerhard Helzel's digitization
    of <a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur6.htm" target="_blank">Element
    Fett</a> (Mar Bitroff, 1933), five font samples down.

    did.  You guys rock! \r\n\r\nGeorge"
