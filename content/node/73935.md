    the one hand I'm critical of the free-for-all approach where students are given
    creative license, but on the other, eager-to-please uniformity doesn't seem quite
    right either.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is too much to put into a one-year course:
    both technics and style -- a technical training in font production encompassing
    multiple scripts, and an education in type design encompassing diversity of style.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Fred Goudy taught lettering at the Holme School in Chicago (to Oz Cooper, among
    others), did he confine students to a single style, because they could pick up
    the rest later?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    (to Oz Cooper, among others), did he confine students to a single style, because
    they could pick up the rest later?</em>\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between
    teaching lettering and teaching typeface design. If I wanted to study lettering,
    I wouldn't sign up for a masters in type design. Lettering is about styles and
    techniques for achieving them. Type design is about mastering a set of skills
    that can be applied to the production of fonts, largely independent of the style
    of lettering embodied in those fonts.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a Reading
    style in the sense that there is a kind of letter that the teachers encourage
    students to produce. This is demonstrated by the fact that over the years numerous
    students have produced designs that clearly do not reflect such a style, and often
    it is these students who have received distinctions for their work. Rather, I
    think there are students who have more and less original ideas about letters,
    and the latter seem to gravitate to some common tropes."

    taught and the production of fonts \u2014 which I take to include both design
    and manufacture -- is the matter to which the skills apply. Anyone who tries to
    teach type design independent of the production of fonts isn't teaching type design.
    He may in fact be teaching lettering, or he might just be failing to teach type
    design."

    (including graphics), production and design are separate jobs.\r\nHowever, in
    small businesses, such as many type foundries, one is required to do both.\r\nThat's
    why I find an emphasis on production, and the idea that design can be picked up
    later, lacking.\r\nSurely both are important.\r\n\r\nDon't you think that a skill
    set which is taught with regard to one genre of type is lop sided? \r\nLike only
    studying how to play Beethoven."

  body: "Hmm\u2026 I have the impression it doesn't make sense to evaluate these typefaces
    side-by-side. It seems to me people go to study to Reading or similar school to
    learn important things about letters, their forms, history and use, and the people
    which attend are as much diverse as you can get.\r\nIn general, it seems to me
    there are people like graphic designers whose desire is to learn more about the
    alphabet which aren\u2019t interested in the beginning to strive for originality
    as a priority for their type design (maybe they will not even design other typefaces).\r\nInversely
    there are people which are extremely interested in learning about letters, which
    may go on to design typefaces and keep on studying the history of the written
    word, but whose typeface may be simply the means to learn better. I envy them,
    since I never had the patience to learn by trial and error, and my personal works
    have been more experiments than other\u2026 :-)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me you can
    have a certain feeling about this \"homogeneity\" so much discussed, but nonetheless
    there are typefaces which are outstanding, while sharing these characteristics.
    One of them, to me, is Cassius by Mathieu R\xE9guer. I would really buy a license,
    whenever he\u2019ll decide to complete it\u2026 :)\r\n\r\nI think it should be
    valued both the pyrotecnic madness of the 1990s (where graphic designers, or complete
    amateurs like me went on designing letters \u2014 and Matthew Carter DO appreciated
    it) and the systematic approach of a design school like Reading or the course
    of the Aia. You can\u2019t suppress one aspect in favor of the other. While I
    deeply value landmark experiments of the 1990s (i.e. Barry Deck\u2019s, to have
    just a name), you realize afterwards that you can really evaluate with an understanding,
    or \u2013 better said \u2013 a personal knowledge of what you handle. This may
    happen to you as an autodidact, but nonetheless you have to learn\u2026 :)"

  body: "Nick, you seem to acknowledge how I explained my use of the term \u2018production\u2019,
    i.e. making fonts, including design and manufacture, and then go on to ignore
    that use.\r\n\r\nI don't think design is somehow left \u2018to be picked up later\u2019
    at Reading, but the focus seems to be on skill development and design is studied
    and practised in the context of making fonts, i.e. of designing typefaces as working
    products not on drawing lovely letters. Insofar as the graduates hope to have
    jobs in the type business, I think this is a sensible approach, because the skills
    they are learning are the skills they will need.\r\n\r\nDoes the Reading programme
    provide in itself all the letter design training that a type designer will need
    to produce not only workable fonts but original, well crafted typefaces? No, I
    don't think it does, and the student work seems to me to reflect pretty clearly
    the prior experience and skills of the individual students. What it does do is
    to teach design skills in the context of making typefaces, which is something
    different than teaching lettering which, if you remember, is the original point
    I made in response to your comment about Goudy and Cooper."

  body: "I generally think the \"constraints\" named by Nick are part of the premises.\r\nMore
    radical experiments would be harder to judge, and they could be misinterpreted,
    so all the room for the experimentation is \"tamed\" in order to produce typefaces
    which are, say \u2013 \"functional\".\r\n\r\nAnyway, some of them aren't constraints
    at all. The proportions of many typefaces produced at Reading are just within
    the range of correct proportions for a text-aimed family. Outside of them, they
    would be unusable.\r\nMy only critique would be that many of them, and of the
    KABK, are too \"polished\", and that\u2018s precisely a reaction to that which
    motivated me to attempt type design in the first place. I disliked what ITC produced
    in the 1970s and 1980s, for example. To me, Barry Deck\u2018s Arbitrary was a
    \"return to lead\" of sorts\u2026 :-)\r\n\r\n@Nick: Thanks, but they need to find
    their time to develop. I need to design something I would use, and I would not
    use most of the things I have done, simply because the cultural climate is different.
    Now the tension is at another level. But I will wait for your \"Radio Shack inspired\"
