  soften a little the geometric look, I drew the L with a diagonal ending stroke and
  the K with the chevron disconnected from the stem. The N is a lowercase.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lnltype_5363.gif]"

  body: "Hi Boros,\r\nI know this is a logo and probably a registered name, but shouldn't
    it be \"LOCK'N'LOAD\", with an extra apostrophe before /n/?"

  body: "Yes, you are right. But me and the client feared it would crowd things too
    much. Honestly, in choosing the position of the single apostrophe, I checked where
    Guns n' Roses put theirs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it just crossed my mind that I
    haven't even tried to use two apostrophes to see how it looks. Will do that, thanks."

  body: On a more practial note, I think that the chevron of /k/ is centered too high.
    Try lowering it a bit and at the same time move the upper right diagonal further
    to the right. /c/ and /a/ feel too wide compared to /o/, /d/ a fraction too narrow.

  body: Perhaps it's a good idea to repeat the diagonal like you have on /L/ in the
    apostrophe(s)?

  body: "I've widened the O and the D. Is the O too wide now, perhaps? The apostrophe
    I think looks better angled. Overall, I think the readability has improved.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lnlwideOcenterK_5084.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    miss the high waist of the K's chevron. I think it lends elegance to the logotype
    if set higher above the center, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lnlwideOhighK_5396.gif]"

  body: "Because they are sheared and they haven't had the same widening as other
    characters, your /L/s now look rather weak. Maybe you should try thickening their
    horizontals. It might also be the case that your overshoot on the curves is a
    bit too much top and bottom.\r\n\r\nI'd sure vote for two apostrophes. For correctness,
    and because with just the one, it looks a bit like \"N'LOAD\" is one word (like
    \"O'Neill or \"D'Arby\")."

  body: "Agree with ^ on L looking weak. Its horizontal is definitely too thin, and
    it sticks out visually.\r\n\r\nHave you tried incorporating the apostrophe into
    the L, i.e. merging them in a single symbol?\r\n\r\nAnother thought - perhaps
    cut the height of N in half and take the apostrophe out?"

  body: "I see what you say about the L. I also feel the O is too wide now. Also,
    in the very first example, at the top, the narrower counter of the O hides better
    the baseline overshoot. I will try a compromise - narrowing a little the O and
    bringing it's height closer to the cap height while decreasing the angle on the
    L ending and/or thickening the horizontal.\r\n\r\nApankrat, I've experimented
    with other n heights or shapes - to get rid of the apostrophes altogether - but
    a smaller n brings too much complication to the design.\r\n\r\nUseful thoughts,
    thank you!"

  body: 'To Tomi from Suomi: here in Romania the phrase "Lock and Load" is quite unknown.
    Even if the audience of this logo - people in the film business - speaks English
    fluently, the syntagma is, nevertheless, unusual to them. Therefore I fear it
    would lose precious legibility if treated as one word.'

    see any difference, and my quess is that you are looking for international clientel.\r\n\r\nCompacting
    just reduces lenght to width -ratio. And you are making a logo, not a name of
    the company. Legally that needs to be somewhere in your A4 anyway."

    But now they are just friends of mine offering their services to local ad agencies
    and the like. Mostly their logo will be advertised on banners at events and filming
    locations. I think they'll need their logo displayed clearly for potential clients
    to make a connection with the verbal name if they hear it afterward, when the
    LNL sales person gives them a call.\r\n\r\nI know that in the end the logotype
    is perceived and recognized as a shape rather than as words, but this takes lots
    of exposure and $.\r\n\r\nOn second thought, you may be right. A two-line book
    face solution may be more readable than my take on this condensed sans, but it's
    the distinct shape that I'm after so I already made that compromise. Why not unify
    this shape?"
