  Jonathan Tobin that I think would be of interest to some of you (if you're in Los
  Angeles). \r\n\r\nCONTRACTS FOR CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS \r\nSaturday, June 15, 2013
  \r\n9:00 AM to 1:00 PM \r\nThe Hub Los Angeles \r\n830 Traction Ave. #3A \r\nLos
  Angeles, CA 90013 \r\nhttp://contractsforcreativeprofessionals.eventbrite.com/\r\n\r\nContracts
  mystify many creative professionals, yet they are the lifeblood of the trade. In
  this workshop, geared towards freelance creatives and small agencies, we will work
  together to understand contracts and see how they can be used as a tool to do better
  work, make more money and keep clients happy. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will teach the
  basics of how contracts work, how to approach contract negotiation as a collaborative
  process, explain important and common contract clauses and offer guidance on when
  and how to seek help drafting or enforcing contracts. \r\n\r\nHere is what you will
  learn, at the very least: \r\n\r\n\u2022 What a contract is and how it is formed.
  \r\n\u2022 How contracts are structured. \r\n\u2022 Common contract clauses. \r\n\u2022
  Typical issues in creative contracts. \r\n\u2022 How to approach contracts with
  your clients in a non-adverserial way. \r\n\u2022 Using online signing services
  to make the process painless. \r\n\u2022 How to find and adapt basic contracts.
  \r\n\u2022 How to enforce contracts. \r\n\u2022 How to work with an attorney to
  draft, modify and enforce contracts. \r\n\r\nSince this is an early \"beta\" of
  what we hope will become a valuable, repeatable event for the creative community,
  participation in this first workshop will be limited to just 10 people and cost
  only $89. \r\n\r\nABOUT THE ORGANIZERS \r\n\r\nJonathan Tobin is a California attorney
  and worked as a graphic designer and web developer for over a decade. He helps creators,
  makers and innovators use the law to become more successful. \r\n\r\nSpencer Cross
  is an LA-based designer and artist. He is an evangelist for the LA design community
  and works to foster community and camaraderie among LA-area creative professionals
  by coordinating a variety of social and educational events and discussion forums."

  body: "Contracts are a great idea, especially for large jobs, but like 5star said
    litigation can indeed be expensive (unless it's a small amount suitable for small
    claims court).\r\n\r\nWith new clients I usually write a letter of agreement that
    spells out what services I'll provide, what the anticipated charges are, the rough
    timeline, etc., and ask for their signature. Usually that prevents misunderstandings
    later on. "
