  major release, \u2018Crewekerne\u2019-in the meantime we\u2019ve been having some
  fun trying it out in \u2018real-world\u2019 applications.\r\n\r\nCrewekerne offers
  a charmingly hand drawn Roman family in the best traditions of the \u2018Arts and
  Crafts\u2019 movement of the early 20th century.  Why not have a look in at our
  [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]] and see Crewekerne at work.  We hope to release
  in the next week or so.\r\n\r\n"
