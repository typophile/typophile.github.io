  body: "Most likely a custom-made title for the magazine. It doesn't match any common
    blackletter font. It has some stylistic similarities to Letterhead Font's LHF
    Old Blackletter. The one PDF on the website includes the title only as outlines,
    while other text is in embedded fonts.  I'd bet that whoever designed it also
    created other alphabetic numbers for himself or herself!\r\n\r\n- Herb\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The general style of the L can also be seen in [[http://www.identifont.com/samples/archive/SchoolText.gif|Archive
    School Text]],  [[http://www.identifont.com/samples/bitstream/Blackletter686.gif|Blackletter
    686BT]], and some others. It hasn't been straightened. The general form of the
    i, n,  r, and v are quite common (but far from identical). Although the spur on
    the i's tittle (dot) is quite unusual. Also, the flourish on the n clearly exists
    only because it's the last letter in the word - it would be out of place elsewhere.
    \ What can't be seen (at least by me) in any other blackletter font is the central
    dip in the top strokes of the a, s, and o. \r\n\r\n - Herb"
