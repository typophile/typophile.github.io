  to find images that start with the letter \"T.\"  I chose to arrange my images in
  a sort of \"pinwheel\" pattern.  I knew I wanted a good amount of whitespace, and
  this pattern would allow for that.  On both pages I seemed to have one very large
  image and several smaller ones, so the pinwheel pattern worked really well.  I also
  used the Ts to make some of the spokes on the pinwheels.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/collage_pt3_6237.jpg]"
