  body: Very "Helvetica" to me. A close alternative would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-haas-grotesk/|Neue
    Haas Grotesk]], Helvetica as its origin, to get the alternate /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-haas-grotesk/std-text-55-roman/glyphs.html#glyphs/536334/323|R]]
