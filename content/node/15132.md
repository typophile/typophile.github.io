  \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the attached graphic file, the original lettershapes (left)
  have a slight organic feel to them - small bumbs and a degree of unevenness, but
  i am after a font that has all the characteristics of the American Typewriter light
  except that it is 'straightend' (right example in the attached graphic).\r\n\r\nThankful
  for any ideas,\r\n\r\nSeb "

    might work for you. It has some of the same qualities as American Typewriter in
    terms of proportions and feel, though it doesn't have the rounded corners and
    stroke endings and has simpler details.

    links. I think that Serifa Thin will be the font of my choice. Just too bad that
    it doesn't have those nice stroke endings.\r\n"
