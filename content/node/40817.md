  was designed and digitized by me and launched in 1993. It was the second typeface
  designed in Denmark. First was Paul S\xF8gren's Jante (1992).Until 1999 Liber\xA9
  was reserved for the exclusive use of the Royal School of Library and Information
  Science - and was my personal font, which it remains. Since 1993 a number of books
  and booklets published by the school were set in Liber\xA9. In 1999 I decided to
  give it wider application, and a few commercially produced books were set in Liber\xA9.
  After 15 years the font can be now acquired for general use. Applications should
  be adresssed to me at psl@psl.dk.\r\n\r\nThe font was designed as a bookface for
  print only, and for use in sizes between 5 and 13 pt. The enclosed GIF image displays
  the characters in rather crude shapes.\r\n\r\nThe attached PDF-file is a poster
  produced for the recent ATyPi conference in Copenhagen. It shows the characters
  as they really look.\r\n\r\nComments are wellcome !\r\n\r\n"
