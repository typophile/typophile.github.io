<p>Marcus Ulpius Traianus was born in 53 AD, and died in 117 AD. He was Roman Emperor from 98–117, during which point the Empire would reach it&rsquo;s greatest extent. During his reign, the Senate and People of Rome as errected a memorial to his wars, which slightly extended the Empire&rsquo;s frontiers even further into &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; territory than they had already been.</p>
<p>This memorial is called &ldquo;Trajan&rsquo;s Column&rdquo; today. Although the object is mostly sculptures in nature (it is a tall column, which has a frieze of relief scultures spiraling up its shaft), a small inscription above the doorway on its base has driven type-minded people mad for centuries.</p>
<p>Contrary to the belif of some, this inscription is neither the debut of the [[Roman Alphabet]], nor the first time that it had used [[serifs]]. It is, however, probably the most famous example of both.</p>
<p>While Roman handwriting was very different from Roman monumental lettering (whether hand painted, engraved, cut out of metal, or cut into stone), the letters on Trajan&rsquo;s Column represent one of the best examples left to us from antiquity. Trajan&rsquo;s Column, and samples like it, would go on to influence the development of the Roman alphabet, and later typeface design, for the next 2,000 years.</p>
<p>What was so special about the Roman&rsquo;s inscriptional lettering? The Romans—who did not invent the idea of the alphabet—where the first to put serifs on their letters. It is speculated that the [[serif]]&rsquo;s origin was a result of applying a brush to the stone before it was carved. Others speculate the serifs were purely an aesthetic addition, put there by the stone carver(s).</p>
<p>There have been several typefaces that are direct &ldquo;revivals&rdquo; of the lettering on Trajan&rsquo;s Column. The most direct and most popular—and the only one to simply bear the name [[Trajan]]—is [[Carol Twombly]] cut for Adobe.</p>
