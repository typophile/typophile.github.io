  have noticed that some classifications of sans serif typefaces are also termed Gothic.
  Please can someone help in clarifying why these obviously different typefaces have
  the same terminology?\r\nThanks"

    Gothic, when referring to blackletter, is kind of slang, for non-type people,
    probably referring to \"Gothic art, a Medieval art movement.\"\r\nI pulled that
    from wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic\r\n\r\nThere are more specifics,
    but that is the basic idea. I hope that helps. Also, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter
    for other ideas. I know wikipedia is not a scholarly resource, but it will give
    you some background."

  body: "In French, Blackletter types or scripts are indeed called \"gothiques\",
    referring to their medieval origins \u2014 it is no coincidence, then, that they
    were revived by Romantic artists, printers and typographers, who where equally
    fond of the Middle Ages, as opposed to the classicist bent of Enlightenment art
    (neo-classical) art and typography (Didot, Bodoni et al)."

    both of which imply detail and business in a way that is clearly absent from sans
    serifs ?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Sans serifs were called grotesque because they were viewed as "extraordinary."
    I'm brainfarting on the term gothic.

    the early sans-serif styles of the 19th century were so foreign to those with
    more conservative design sensibilities that they were seen as barbaric and offensive,
    and therefore they applied such derisive names to them. This of course, could
    be nothing more than an urban legend."

  body: Then again, the subtle meanings of words such as awesome, awful, extraordinary,
    exceptional, special, remarkable, spectacular, and other such descriptors have
    undergone significant shifts over time, some even in complete reversal. These
    words could be another case of the language getting away from the words' meanings.

  body: this is fascinating. i read that hitler considered serifs to be decadent and
    instituted official use of sans, but then again those guys liked the blackletter....
