body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Parallel-Histories_6425.gif]\r\n\r\nBased
  on the handwriting, possibly, of Juan de Yciar of Spain, 1600 CE.\r\n\r\nThere are
  about 100 ligatures, give or take, that work right now.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't know
  how to do is implement contextual alternates/swashes/titling alternates in a way
  that doesn't make Fontlab explode :) I have multiple alternates, starting swashes
  and ending swashes, but I don't know how to make them work.\r\n\r\nI have them sitting
  there in the file listed as:\r\n<code>e_z.alt1</code>\r\n<code>e_z.alt2</code>\r\n<code>e_z.swsh</code>\r\n<code>e_z.swsh.alt1</code>\r\n\r\nHow
  do you get an alternate of a swashed ligature? (This e_z swash has a tail that goes
  up, but this one has a tail that goes down...)\r\n\r\nI think I would like it to
  work with dligs etc., so that the variations are still selectable via the Opentype
  panel.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n"

  body: That Q isn't even the biggest or the flashiest available! I kept only the
    "basic" characters for the standard U&lc. The alternates are so much cooler, but
    less "useable". (If only I knew how to program the dumb things in...)
