  body: "I wish design schools would teach rudimentary business. So many come out
    asking this very question.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to figure out is what you'd
    need to charge to have a theoretical living wage if you were doing this full time.\r\n\r\n($
    desired annual salary + $ expenses) / # billable hours a year = hourly rate\r\n\r\nKeep
    in mind you won't be billable 40 hours a week and don't underestimate your expenses.\r\n\r\nAfter
    figuring that out, you can adjust as needed based on experience, skills, market
    etc."

  body: "We came up with a yardstick in the old Compuserve DTPForum nearly 20 years
    ago that provides a good starting point.\r\n\r\nTake the amount of money that
    you would work for in a \"real job\". Not the entry rate, but the rate you would
    expect to get after a year or two to keep you from looking for something better.
    This is probably what your skills are worth (unless you have an inflated self
    worth). \r\n\r\nTriple that amount. \r\n\r\nThat's it. You need to triple the
    base because you aren't getting benefits, paid holidays, or paid training/research
    time. You also will spend a lot of hours that are not billed. And you have expenses
    for your office, computer, and software.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you feel you
    are worth $20 working in an agency, then your rate should be $60 an hour. If you
    are worth $25, then your rate should be $75. And if you were thinking of only
    charging $30 an hour to freelance, you should realize that this is less than the
    minimum wage (in Ontario, at least)."
