		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t know about it being the easy or fast answer. The butterfly idea was chosen over several concepts that weren&#39;t shown here. The client liked the idea of the butterfly because it is like a gift, emerging from the cocoon, etc... It sounds like you are critiquing the second layout with the more &#34;realistic&#34; butterfly--I did redraw the butterfly in the last item in my post--I agree that the more realistic butterfly was too easy and much too complicated for a logo, but I think the colour version simplifies and enhances the concept. The wings of the butterfly become bows on the box. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m open to criticism on this, but I&#39;m not sure I understand where you are coming from. Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point Daniel. I&#39;ll have another look at that.  <BR> <BR>I do think that stylistically &#40;is that a word?&#41; that tracking the letters in all caps does help with legibility and it also feels a bit more elegant. It may be possible to make &#39;on the run&#39; more solid by not letterspacing it. I&#39;ll play around with it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the &#39;butterfly as bow&#39; idea, but the &#39;on the run&#39; concept is diminished in your newer versions. What if the butterfly was alighting on the upper-left plane of the diamond &#40;box&#41;? So you&#39;d see the &#39;bow&#39; from the side rather than from above? It would add some action/dynamics to the logo which would conceptually compliment &#39;on the run&#39; while maintaining the bow thing. You could also add the ribbon cross back on the box. The top-down view reminds me of pinned insects in a museum.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good idea, Chris. Thanks. <BR> <BR>I have played down the &#39;on the run&#39; part of the identity a bit because it sort of cheapens the feel that we are trying to create for the company. However, it is there in the name, so I should likely do a better job pulling it out.  <BR> <BR>The clientele they are going after is corporate and relatively high end. The on the run part is that they are the only ones in this market to provide a complete online solution for this service.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments Darrel and Tiffany. <BR> <BR>Darrel, I also have a horizontal version for online use which makes the type much larger and more legible. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, we had done several versions before the ones I&#39;ve posted here that were like that, and the client decided she liked the more stationery bow version. I am going to look at &#34;speeding up&#34; the typography a bit for the final version though to get that across. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your comments. Much appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It might just be me, but I don&#39;t think your latest designs say high-end gifts. Overall I get the sense of a quickie-mart. Perhaps because there&#39;s a local gas station chain called &#34;on the run&#34; and the rounded corner diamond box reminds me more of a traffic sign than a gift. I think Chris had some very interesting suggestions in his Feb 9th critique. The new placement of the butterfly could help emphasize the &#34;gift emerging&#34; concept that brought in the butterfly symbol in the first place. And I would also suggest looking at different type solutions. The type in your initial posting had a little more of a sophicated feel to it. The sans, although easy and clear to read, in it&#39;s current layout &#40;justified, and loosely kerned&#41; just seems stuck on. Would it be possible to intergrate the type and the mark?</div>
