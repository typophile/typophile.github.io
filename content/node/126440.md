body: This logo I've been working on for too damned long and am now so blind to any
  aesthetic or design aspect of it that I am calling SOS out to the universe....Fresh
  eyes needed. Thanks, oh and this is a logo I am creating for myself and the biz
  I am launching, so no issues with it's posting here. It's all mine. Critique away,
  Many Thanks in advance

  body: "The mark is great. I prefer the mark on the right. But you could use both
    for different purposes. If you're going to use the mark on the left at all, I'd
    remove the black bar on top.\r\nI like the second type treatment (i.e. the boldest
    one, second from the top on either side) but the width disparity between CK in
    ROCKET is drawing my attention. My suggestion is to cut the ends of the C in ROCKET
    a bit shorter (but leave the C in CARGO as it is!)"
