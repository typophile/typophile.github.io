  caps]], but then they added the MEd to the layout and I don't know what the right
  thing is to do? This is a publication so I have to think about it being consistent
  with last issue also. Should i make only the d lowercase? make everything but the
  d uppercase?\r\n\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    and why I generally recommend against it. PhD, which is more common, presents
    the same problem. \r\n\r\nI don't think there's a good solution in your situation.
    Good luck."

  body: "Well at least I know I am in good company not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\nBut
    what about the fact that her name is in small caps also? I could \"fix\" it by
    changing her name to all uppers and lowers, but then it would not be consistent
    with last issue.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to keep her name in all small caps what should
    I do?\r\n\r\nthanks again!"

  body: "There are three things you can do.\r\n\r\nAs it is a rare occurrence, a little
    manual work on the \"d\" is OK.\r\n\r\n1. Reduce the size of lower case \"d\",
    then increase its weight by applying a \"Stroke\" value. \r\n2. Use a \"d\" from
    a smaller optical size, if your typeface has one.\r\n3. Choose a \"d\" from a
    related font that has the appropriate weight at the size.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JaneSmith_5630.jpg]"
