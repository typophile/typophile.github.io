body: "When designing a font:\r\n\r\n1) Do you work with preliminary sketches or directly
  on the computer?\r\n\r\n2) Do you follow a strict geometric approach on your designs
  or a more intuitive and empirical approach (where geometry plays a secondary role)?"

  body: "Personally, I used to do more sketches but now I just go right to the blank
    computer screen and start. \r\nRegarding geometry, it depends on the typeface.
    \ Sometimes the geometry is  the concept but usually I just use my eyes and let
    my mind decide what it sees to be done. I have no hard \"method\", so I can't
    really pin it down.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "1) It depends on the design, but generally I'm not good enough (yet?) to
    avoid making semi-finished sketches (at least of the key glyphs).\r\n\r\n2) I
    avoid geometry explicitly (unless somebody pays me [enough] to rely on it). And
    although it's funny that you say \"intuitive <cite>and</cite> empirical\", that's
    actually exactly what I do! I trust myself, but not completely, and think it's
    very important -especially in text type- to pay central attention to empiricism
    and theory.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: i usually do them right in the computer, but i suspect that eventually i'll
    do more sketching. it really depends on the design though, which leads into the
    second question about geometry. depending on what the design is, sometimes it's
    easier to do in a computer (and with a grid if you want perfect symmetry) but
    other designs are certainly easier to draw on paper first.
