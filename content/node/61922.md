body: "Ok, I know that this is a clich\xE9 subject but I simply don't have the patience
  to seek out the answer that I want. I'm willing to buy a Samsung ML1640 Monochrome
  printer for home type proofs. It has a 1200x600 ppp. I'm a college student so I
  don't have enough money to buy an expensive one. Is this resolution enough? Like
  I don't want professional result, just to have a notion of the type appearence on
  paper. \r\n\r\nSo I ask again, is 1200x600 ppp (points per pica I assume) enough
  for type proof?\r\nThanks"
