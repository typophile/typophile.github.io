body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm pretty inexperienced when it comes to typography, so I
  could use a hand, if possible. I've been looking for a suitable typeface for my
  logotype for the past 3 hours and I'm even more confused than when I started.\r\n\r\nMy
  project is just a WordPress-based magazine-style website about personal development.\r\n\r\nBasically,
  I'm considering using Calluna for headlines and sub-headings and Calluna Sans for
  body text and meta.\r\n\r\nI need a typeface for the logotype that will complement
  Calluna and Calluna Sans. Ideally, I'd like a modern, clean, and fresh humanist
  sans-serif in either medium or semi-bold weights that will look good at large sizes
  (around 36-48px). Groteque, geometric, etc don't really fit in the way humanist
  does. \r\n\r\nThe only fonts I liked were Whitney and Bree in italics. But I feel
  really unsure. Do you think these fonts will complement Calluna and Calluna Sans?
  Or are there other fonts that will complement these?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "> Why do I need a designer?\r\n\r\nMaybe Andreas suggested that because you're
    apparently designing your own logotype but describe yourself as \"inexperienced\"
    and \"confused\".\r\n\r\nIf you've got a plumbing job to do and you don't know
    anything about plumbing, then maybe hiring a plumber is a good idea. The same
    principle applies here."
