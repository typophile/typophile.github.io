body: I've been developing a new sans serif/display typeface for a concert poster
  design, a super geometric typeface design to complement Avenir or Avant Garde in
  uppercase, that I would like to call Britannica. I was just looking for some suggestions
  for ways I could give it more of a personality to the letterforms. This is my first
  formal typeface, and I haven't done lowercase yet, but I was looking for some creative
  imput. Thanks...

  body: "First look I'd say, this typeface seems to have potential. At my point of
    view, I'suggested to raise the middle bar of th E, F, H, B, The K looks like it's
    an arrow hurting a vertical line and this arrow is too in the middle. The Z is
    too wide and the G too narrow compare to the C and the O. The diagonale line of
    the S seems to low.\r\n\r\nThe Q is right on."
