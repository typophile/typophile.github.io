  packs or bundles which are worth acquiring for someone interesting in building up
  a library of fonts for general text setting? I\u2019ve seen a few posts and the
  Typowiki entry but, on searching around, haven\u2019t found much that is either
  affordable (say no more than \xA3100) or which isn\u2019t primarily composed of
  decorative or \u201Cspecial purpose\u201D typefaces (e.g. scripts, blackletter typefaces
  &c).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIndeed, the only package I\u2019ve found which seems to
  fit the bill is Adobe\u2019s \u201C[[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1902|Type
  Basics OpenType Edition]]\u201D which is about \xA3100 and has a good selection
  of classic body-text typefaces (e.g. Adobe Caslon, Myriad, Garamond, Gill Sans).
  The cheaper \u201C[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1507|WebType
  Pro]\u201D package at about \xA370 would also be appealing if it had full versions
  of the typefaces.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if anything else is available from
  other designers or retailers? I think if you are prepared to spend about \xA3200
  or more there is a reasonable selection, but little else in the more affordable
  category and almost nothing from the major designers. This did make me wonder if
  the Adobe package is just cheaper because they usually give those fonts away in
  software bundles, but perhaps I just haven\u2019t been able to find anything...\r\n\r\n(For
  what it\u2019s worth, the reason I am quite cost-concerned is that I am an amateur
  who would just use them for personal use!)\r\n\r\nAny recommendations would be gratefully
  received!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJacob"

    also offers good quality typefaces, often with smallcaps etc. They don\u2019t
    have OpenType goodies, but they are very priceworthy. For instance check URW Antiqua.\r\n\r\nTry
    to define what kind of typefaces you might need, like a basic set. (Oldstyle Serif,

    find the original fonts that fit your budget and your wishes. \r\n\r\nI am still

    leave it, but I have tested the quality of several FontSite fonts and they are
    good. You could try the freefonts they offer (under downloads) though these are
    without smallcaps and Osf. Also they are open to questions and are willing to
    make adjustments. It all depends on what you expect and what you want to pay.
    \r\n\r\nAs a start I would suggest to buy yourself some decent fonts (a good serif
    and a good sansserif for general purposes for starters) and grow along from there. "

    the post! ;-)\r\n\r\n<em>metalfoot</em>. Thanks for the suggestion. I might try
    that, seeing that they sell for very little money on ebay. I\u2019d been a bit
    wary considering how frequently one requires odd characters in normal text (and
    I\u2019d read they were rather basic versions) but it might be worth a punt to
    see what\u2019s there.\r\n\r\n<em>Queneau</em>. Again, thanks for the suggestions.
    I think your post rather highlights what had been confusing me: there are lots
    of offers for 1,000 fonts (or even 12,222 in that Megafont pack!) for not very
    much money, or quite a lot of decent fonts for quite a lot of money (e.g. Storm
    Type has a Sans Megapack including 344 fonts for \u20AC398) but almost nothing
    which includes a few good fonts for a smaller amount of money. I had in mind something
    along the lines of 12 fonts (e.g. three text faces with R, B, I, BI) at about
    \xA310 - 15 each. Something to fill an intermediate step between the free fonts
    that many places now offer and full-priced professional ones, bought individually.
    \r\n\r\nLooking through your recommendations, Canada Type and elsener+flake sets
    are along the lines of what I had in mind, so I might think about buying one of
    those (and the Adobe set, although I appreciate what you say about needing to
    licence CS eventually).\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I had already followed your advice,
    and bought some full typefaces; it was more an interest in being able to flesh
    out my library with a few more swiss-army-knife typefaces for when I get bored
    of those or want to play around with some other ideas!\r\n\r\nThanks again. Any
    other ideas are very welcome!"

    so you might get a good deal there. Gibson is certainly useful, and very cheap
    for an original modern sans. It does not have osf or smallcaps, but for this kind
    of font this might not be essential. And with the discount it's only 36 USD! They
    have some very good display fonts but also some good text families, like Recta,
    Roos, Semplicita, Ronaldson. I licensed several of their fonts, and they are all
    of high quality. recommended!

  body: "Just to provide you with some more info on Megafont XXL and FontSite.\r\n\r\nThe
    fonts contained (12.222 is optimistic, this includes modifications (outline, antiqued
    etc.) which are not ver useful, Central European versions (which only differ in
    2 characters I believe, Expert sets (though unnesserary as TrueType fonts can
    contain up to, what 65.000 characters..., numeral fonts (same)) amount to about
    3.500, which can be devided in the following categories:\r\n\r\n- Fonts named
    with a letter + three digit combination plus a generic name (like sans). These
    are poorly converted (probably back and forth from postscript) with bad outlines
    and poor spacing. These are not useful at all. \r\n- Fonts with Serial in the
    name. These are from the Brendel and Pabst collection, also sold, for much more
    money, as Typeshop fonts. These are basically a normal version of a font with
    additional weights generated automatically. These fonts have very limited, display
    use, but it's better not to bother.\r\n- The rest can be broken down in fonts
    sourced from the old Berthold collection and fonts from URW(++). The fonts from
    the former are often not useful as they are set way too tightly and the overall
    spacing and kerning is bad. These usually have a smaller character set. The URW
    fonts are often given the XXL tag (in the Megafont PDF, one can download it from
    the Softmaker site). These are the are the most useful set of fonts on the CD.
    They often have a big character set (with east european characters, ligatures,
    fractions etc.) and are quite well spaced and kerned. The outlines of these fonts
    are good, as they were not converted from postscript, like the Berthold ones.
    If you would buy the CD, it would be for these fonts. Most of these are renamed,
    but Franklin Gothic, Baskerville, Clarendon, Garamond etc can be found here as
    well.\r\n\r\nAs for the FontSite fonts: These are generally the same fonts as
    the Softmaker ones (they used to work together, so they have the same source)
    but in OpenType PS format, with OT features like fractions, ligatures, sometimes
    osf and smallcaps or discretionary ligatures. From a technical perspective these
    are sound, as they build on a solid foundation. As a backup set they can be used,
    IMO, but I think beyond that it is better to selectively buy fonts from nice,
    original foundries (not necessarily the MonoLinoStreamHold Type emporeum, though
    unfortunately the do have some really beautiful classic fonts...) It just feels
    better and makes the work more original."

    quite agree. I do sometimes wonder whether there is a market for those outside

    any marketing at it at the moment since the prices are so high that only those
    in the industry (or with very deep pockets) can afford them. \r\n\r\nWhat has
    often confused me about typeface prices is that if one is mostly buying a licence
    to use the design of the typeface (rather than just the font software), there
    is an extraordinary lack of flexibility in the pricing structure and lack of regard
    to how the fonts will be used. For example, if I want to buy Emigre\u2019s Mrs
    Eaves, I pay the same irrespective of whether I am an amateur who just want to
    set my Christmas cards or whether I have been contracted by Bloomsbury to set
    the next Harry Potter. In the photography world, I think I am correct in saying
    that you often pay both for the number of machines that you want to use the photo
    on but also based on how many copies you want to make of the picture and in what
    circumstances; something very much lacking in the font world.\r\n\r\nI think if
    I could buy a full typeface for about \xA350, even with a very restrictive licence
    (not to use it in print-runs over 100, for example), I know I would have bought
    many more but there are few available in this category. Indeed, I seem to spend
    far more money on letterpress fonts these days which are, inexplicably, often
    far cheaper than their digital equivalents..."

    The market for big corporate licenses is much more lucrative, so this is where

    Some foundries on MyFonts offer a choice between a personal or a commercial license,
    like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dunwich/armitage/|Armitage]] by Dunwich Type.
