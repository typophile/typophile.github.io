  want to add the title of the card at bottom. However, Its debatable since some decks
  don't have them. The Tarot of Marseilles does have titles and my set is loosely
  patterned after it. I like the French decks so I like the typography to match the
  style. I chose Baskerville initially but I'm not certain of it. Can anyone offer
  some insight or suggestions what I should do typographically? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temperance_4891.jpg]"

  body: "Excellllent. Some suggestions:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/jannon/\">Storm
    Jannon</a>. Based on an antique French model, excellent update by Frantisek Storm.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/9245\">Christian Gothic</a>. No, it's not
    released, but I'd be happy to let you work with a beta version if you felt it
    was right.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/della-robbia/\">Della
    Robbia</a>. It's based on an Italian model rather than French, but has the right
    flavor of antiquity and matches the low stroke contrast but sharp features of
    the card you showed.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/\">Beaufort</a>
    by Nick Shinn. A beautiful modern update to the same genre as Della Robbia, and
    by a designer who's still breathing.\r\n\r\nMost of all, have fun! Go with whatever
    works best visually with your artwork.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oddly, tho' not really authentic for a French deck (perhaps one based on
    the Swiss, however), I like the suggestion of the Della Robbia. Look, carefully
    whether you'll want a boldface to make an impression with the illustrations on
    the Major Arcana. Brings up a good question: Are you fully illustrating the minor
    Arcana--i.e, the Ace  of Cups, Nine of Pentacles, etc.--as many decks do? If you've
    thought of just using the number and suit for the Minor, I'd suggest having a
    look at the Crowley deck.\r\n\r\nGood luck with this. There are many, many variations.
    It takes a stout heart, I think, to wade in to a design with such a long history
    of different versions going back so many years."

  body: "Right now I'm just going to work with the Major Arcana (21 cards). Its too
    daunting to conceive of the others. I'm just focusing on one at a time. Although
    the minor cards could be just variations of one design or illustration.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not too big on Della Robbia I have to admit. Its difficult to convey the look
    I'm intending. I may be a hypocrite for saying this but maybe a serif that looks
    handwritten? I like to hear more suggestions though the feedback does help."

    not to cut corners by just duplicating and flipping the wing.\r\n\r\nare you looking
    for these kind of fonts?\r\n[[http://www.eosdev.com/Illustrations_Quotes/Cyndi/temperance.jpg|image1]]

  body: Yeah the more I look at it the more I may actually illustrate the wings. I
    was thinking of using Mrs. Eaves as the typeface, however it may be a little too
    hackneyed. Any opinions on this?

  body: How stereotypical do you want to be? I mean do you want "historically cloying"
    or something that might fit but have more of a twist? I think Mrs. Eaves would
    be a fine alternative, what about Dalliance?

    See ITC Golden Cockerel, or Storm''s Aichel, Amor serif or Libcziowes, depending
    on the degree of menace desired. '

  body: "I want the cards to feel somewhat traditional but graphically contemporary.
    I obviously have darker sensibilities but I don't think it has to be menacing.
    \ I saw H.R. Giger's interpretation and its a bit too futurist for me. \r\n\r\nITC
    Golden Cockerel looks great but I think I sold myself on Mrs Eaves. I'm not sure
    I'm using the T and E ligature correctly. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temperance_3684.png]"

  body: I wouldn't suggest using the TE ligature in that way. Readability is incredibly
    limited. I'd even avoid using that ligature unless all caps are being used and
    it is in the middle of a word where context would help.

  body: There, now there's no reason to use Mrs. Eaves. ;) Honestly I find Mrs. Eaves
    very trendy. There seem to be plenty of typefaces that will give the flavor you
    seek. Many from Storm.

  body: i agree with Carl, i don't think Mrs. Eaves is a good fit for the feeling
    of your illustrations. I think Storms work is more in line with the essence you
    have captured in your drawings (judging only from the one you have posted). Storms
    faces have subtlety and depth and a bit of piquancy, Mrs Eaves is too cute for
    this. But that could just be my opinion.

  body: "Oh ok ok. I guess Mrs. Eaves might be a little bit \"been there, done that\".
    I just think someone has to be a champion for that poor typeface that really does
    get stick quite often. I think it is a pretty typeface that was just overused
    and now everyone now hates it.\r\n\r\nDemocratica looks very nice."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temperance2_5749.jpg]\r\n\r\nI might
    be over-thinking it but I like Historical Allsorts \u2013 Fell Type Roman from
    Hoefler & Frere-Jones. Ok I agree Mrs. Eaves is a bit trendy but I liked the versatility
    of the face. I don't have any of the Storms so I can't test drive it.\r\n\r\nI
    love Democratica but I'm not sure I want to rip it. Yeah the Carnival\xE9 intro
    was one of the inspirations.\r\n\r\nThe wings are just compiled in\u2014I'll illustrate
    them shortly.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the comments its been extremely helpful. Anyone
    know where I can find a a good weathered background?"

    <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html"> PSY/OPS</a> fonts, especially
    Lars Bergquist's stuff.  And also try Jos Buivenga's donationware fonts at <a
