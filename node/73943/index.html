  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This semester I decided to add a banned fonts list to the syllabus for my typography class. I did this not because I don’t want to see certain fonts, but because I feel that some students get hung up on simple office and academic document styles because it’s all they know, and I hope that taking away the fonts they associate with such work will push them creatively without discouraging critiques. I’ve tried to just ban a few common fonts without going after (relatively) less commonly used system fonts like Futura, Palatino, and Hoefler Text. And my students all have access to lab computers with excellent font collections. Am I missing anything in this list?</p>
<p>Arial
Century Gothic
Georgia
Helvetica
Impact
Papyrus

<p>They do, but not because they’re used to using it in generic contexts. And comparing text set in Futura with a text face is always a good lesson. And as for Trajan, I doubt most of my students will even know what it is.</p>

<p>You’re misinterpreting this. My goal is to teach students to work with type in ways that they don’t already. I don’t teach at an art school, so many of my students will have little experience with type aside from stuff like school papers, resumes, and basic office work. They only get one semester of typography in this program—which is also their core design class–so it’s important that I get them to think beyond the basics ASAP.</p>

<p>Actually, all of your forbidden fonts are excellent, in their own ways and for specific purposes. Instead of forbidding their use, perhaps you might suggest that they not be used except for &ldquo;good cause,&rdquo; which the student would be allowed to offer and defend.

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it was, and I apologize if that&rsquo;s the impressions I conveyed in my post. What I DID say is that font choices should be thoughtful; I am reasonably confident that we could agree that, if the subject were—say—&ldquo;mindless conformity,&rdquo; that Arial or Times New Roman would, in fact, be excellent choices.</p>

I wonder if it would be more instructive work it in reverse and charge a $100 material fee for purchase of no more than 2 fonts. They would need to use those fonts, and only those fonts for the semester (or quarter). Would be eye-opening and probably painful for some! (you might have a vetted list). What does it mean to own a font? What is good value? How to wring the most from your type?

<p>I am of the belief that typography professional should be able, or at least try, to make the best use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> typeface, overused or underused. Even if I don’t like it. This is what I teach… I see no point in blacklisting typefaces, Arial, or Papyrus, or Comic Sans, or Souvenir, or whatever. This restriction may send the students a wrong message: that typography is about using pretty fonts. Which it isn’t. It’s like Vignelli said, ‘In other words, it’s not the type but what you do with it that counts’.</p>

Truthfully, there is no font that should be banned.  Teach them how to use fonts, not how to create prejudices about them.

		<div class="commentbody">For one of my earliest typography assignments from Ken Hiebert, we were all given the same galley proof with all the text for a mail-order book store. The text was all set in one font in one size and strung together in a continuous stream. The assignment was to design a sensible and easy to use order form, using only space and positioning as a means. We had 3 hours to design and paste it up.
I learned more in that three hours about using type than at any other time in my life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The point of the assignment was that all typography problems come with constraints&ndash;they often seem unreasonable to a design student. After they graduate and work a few years, they find that real-world client constraints can be even more stifling. What you learn is that constraints open up a micro world which you never would have noticed if you had all avenues open to you.  I learned to LOVE constraints. It was much easier if space, time, and architecture were limited&ndash;even if it WAS more challenging.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It certainly is true that an assignment where the typeface is chosen is a useful exercise. But I don&rsquo;t think that has relevance to whether or not a banned font list is a good idea.</p>
<p>Presumably, many different types of exercise belong in a typography course. Some that address working with elements other than choice of typeface. Some that address working with a very limited choice of typeface - in which case, in real-world situations, it might well be that the only fonts available would form a list very similar to the banned font list here.</p>
<p>But some exercises might well involve an open-ended choice of typeface. In that case, banning the most well-known typefaces to encourage the students to more fully explore the alternatives available seems an entirely reasonable thing to do.</p>
<p>Since this is an introductory course, though, some of the students may not be familiar with too many different typefaces; operating systems don&rsquo;t come with a simple command that says &ldquo;create a specimen sheet of all the fonts installed on the system&rdquo;. (One older word processor puts the entry in the drop-down menu for each face in that face, but that can clearly cause problems with symbol fonts.) So I could imagine some students simply experiencing difficulty in finding a suitable face for an assignment because they don&rsquo;t know where to look.</p>
<p>So I hope their textbooks or other course materials give them an idea of what a number of different faces look like, so they have a reference point to start from.</p>

<p>James, I did things two different ways. There were assignments where I assigned the typeface because the practice of setting type was more important than picking the typeface. And there were assignments where I&rsquo;d leave it open to them. But I did have a conversation with the students that always discussed what the system fonts are there for and when and why they might be used. I am sure I had some snarky things to say as to why we&rsquo;d never use them in print, but at the end of the day I was trying to show the students that the system fonts, while not strictly verboten, were not appropriate in their work.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed that as well, but Abaddon is much better than back when everything metal/goth/industrial was set in Morpheus. And really, that’s what you get for naming a font after a wargaming fiction character who’s quite popular with metalheads ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What restarted this thread after the long hiatus&hellip;</p>
<p>And it seems to me it applies to a world where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->branding &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that it &ndash; is perceived as the only serious use of type. Were I teaching a course on book typography, I&rsquo;d perhaps make a similar banishing, which would be quite different list. Odd notion that popularity make something bad. Do you folk, as sellers of fonts, want your work to be the exception to this notion that popular is an evil? Perhaps that&rsquo;s a slippery slope?</p>

<p>We could also ban popular, overused colors, like red, green and blue. And overused shapes, like squares, circles and triangles.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">No one on this thread is saying that red is bad, nor that Times New Roman is evil, only that it is a useful exercise in her class for her students. The question she asked is which fonts are so widely used by beginners that they act as crutches and stifle creativity; she didn&rsquo;t say the fonts are bad, nor that they can&rsquo;t be used well. She&rsquo;s right to have her students do this exercise and right to ask for suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Toad42, I was just joking.</p>
<p>Although I actually have heard people, in other forums, denounce the overuse of certain colors. For example, red and yellow are used in a large percentage of fast food signs, and driving down some streets it seems like almost every sign is using those colors.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone seriously say they should be &ldquo;banned&rdquo;, with the possible exception of some communities that may have highly restrictive signage codes, such as historic areas. I drove through a community once where the McDonalds was a dignified brick building with a tiny brass sign, which I&rsquo;m sure was due to local codes.</p>
