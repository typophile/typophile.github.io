body: "On a recent trip my father made to Vietnam, he picked up an interesting piece
  of cultural artifact. He went to an institution where people wrote poems. I cannot
  think of an equivalent in Western culture.\r\n\r\nThis is written on a thin handkerchief\u2014the
  image measuring approximately 6\" x 6\". \r\n\r\nAt first glance you would think
  the writing is Chinese calligraphy. It is not.\r\nRotate the image 90\xBA counter
  clockwise and upon close examination, the writing is in Vietnamese (roman characters)
  calligraphy.\r\nThough very tough to read for someone who is able to read Vietnamese.\r\n\r\nI
  thought this piece of artifact is interesting because I have never seen a written
  language written to mimic another.\r\n\r\nHere is the link\r\nhttp://designtn.com/type/chinese_vietnamese.jpg\r\n\r\n:tony"

    have seen it before but what I posted I think is very well executed.\r\nI thought
    it was Chinese calligraphy until my father told me it's not."

  body: "Compare the Chinese characters \u672C and \u4E8B to them, it's fun. By the
    way, the way to compose alphabetic letters vertically with a vertical baseline
    reminds me of Mongolian Script: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_alphabet
    ."

  body: "<cite>I would be curious to know how it's perceived by someone which is accustomed

    post), I'd have assumed they were traditional characters in a script that I'm
    unfamiliar with.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm not \"someone accustomed to chinese calligraphy\".
    My thoughts are based on having studied [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_script|Standard
    Script / \u6977\u4E66]] for two years for my GCE O'Levels. That was about 10 years
    ago."
