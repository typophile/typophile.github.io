  body: "Well, the original won't look like that - it'll look like a \"normal\" font
    without all that funky (and quite sloppy) rounding. You could try to find a legitimate
    font that looks like Harabara, but that seems like a long shot. Or if you'd like
    to have a clean conscience you could use Harabara but purchase the original and
    hopefully use it on some future project.\r\n\r\nSo guys, what is Harabara based
    on?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
