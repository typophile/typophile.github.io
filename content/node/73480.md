  years ago. Now I can't find the name nor where to acquire this version of Breite
  Kanzlei ornamental. What makes it more unusual is the outline and fill-design in.
  Usually one can find B.K. regular as a solid fill black. Any ideas oh great Typophile
  community?? \r\nThanks in advance\r\nxo =o= xo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TEMP-Image_1_14_6001.jpg]"
