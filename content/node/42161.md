body: "I'm searching for information on historic characters sets, that means: which
  characters were present at a certain time at a printers office - e.g. Hans Lufft
  in Wittenberg for the bible prints in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nInformation in this
  special details (based on a printers available set) would be fine, \r\nbut even
  a more generic table would help, e.g.\r\nWhen did a versal (capital) U join the
  character set besides the capital V used for \"U\"?\r\n\r\nI already did some research
  on this, but couldn't find any information online.\r\n\r\nMy interest results from
  a special case:\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the Schwabacher which Hans Lufft used for
  the german bible prints between 1534 and 1545. \r\nAs far as I can see he hadn't
  a capital U (\"rounded\" form) but used everywhere capital V (as used at that time).
  On the other hand small u and v are present and used alternatively.\r\nLooking on
  specimens I have available (e.g. Muzika, Die sch\xF6ne Schrift) there isn't a capital
  U but \"... T V W ...\", but at the same time there seems to be U already in Fraktur.\r\nIn
  later specimens of Schwabacher U is present.\r\n\r\nSo there should be any information
  when certain glyphs were introduced into the character set of fonts.\r\n\r\nI know
  an essay listing \"The supply of types in the sixteenth century\" by \"A. F. Johnson\",
  but it does only list the fonts a printer had available and doesn't mention nor
  show the character sets.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can help me to find out more.\r\nThanks
  in advance for every hint.\r\n\r\nMichael Schlierbach"

  body: "Johnson, in <em>One Hundred Title Pages,</em> notes G.G. Trissino as being
    a proponent of Latin alphabet reform -- introducing the U and J to disambiguate
    from V and I (and also proposing \"borrowing\" omega to disambiguate long and
    short \"o\").\r\n\r\nHowever, his Wiki page doesn't mention this aspect of his
    career.\r\n\r\nThis page is from 1529, with the types of Lodovico Vicentino.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trissino_4193.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    looks like, during the time that Trissino's reforms were making their way into
    general usage, printers would improvise, borrowing the \"new\" roman characters
    from Greek or Italic sorts. Or perhaps, as with a titling W, cobbling it together
    from a couple of Vs."

  body: "Wow, very interesting page. Thanks for the posting of this!\r\n\r\nApart
    from the fact, that they're different fonts in the titling line the omega really
    looks good, especially in the italic line (why didn't it succeed? maybe in these
    times as well as our times not always the best solutions are successful ;-) )\r\n\r\nSo
    Johnson seems to be am important person/researcher in these questions?"
