I recently heard that by inserting code into the AFM file you can make ligature replacments happen, but my experiments have not yet yielded any results. <BR> <BR>Maybe the question could have been different: &quot;What is Adobe doing that no one else is?&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I assume that Robert is speaking of Quark's automatic ligature function, which automatically replaces fi and fl ligatures only. Unfortunately, it only does this with fonts that are encoded with Adobe Standard Encoding. Emigre, Storm, Font Bureau, Hoefler, and others do not always generate with Adobe Standard Encoding. <BR> <BR>The AFM trick doesn't do any good on the Mac platform. I saw that documented in the Type 1 spec, but never got it to work either. I think it may only apply to Windows systems. (Note that the fi and fl ligatures themselves are not available from the Windows keyboard.) <BR> <BR>The irony here is that fonts which have been made with the extra ff ligatures in some of the less frequently used character slots (which is why they don't use Adobe encoding) don't get the basic fi and fl ligs substituted, so it all has to be done manually. <BR> <BR>This is undoubtedly due to the Quark implementation of its substitution algorithm. Presumably is assumes that if a font isn't encoded with Adobe Standard Encoding, then it might not be an alphabetic font, and so it doesn't do any f-lig substitution. <BR> <BR>There is actually a workaround for this, which Cherie Cone applies to Carter &amp; Cone fonts. It involves modifying a resource in the suitcase. She uses a proprietary utility (that only works on old Mac OSes, I think). I have info here somewhere, but I don't remember the details offhand. If I get a chance, I'll look it up. <BR> <BR>On the flip side, Thomas Phinney tells me that InDesign will automatically replace not only the fi and fl ligs from a regular PS Type 1 font, but also ff-ligs, if they are present and named in a certain way. The downside is that they aren't actually encoded, so there can't be any kern pairs for them. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>
