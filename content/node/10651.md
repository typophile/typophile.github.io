  <BR> <BR>Tyson A is a rather conventional grotesque, really. It was done  <BR><i>very</i>

  Tyson B: it wasn&#39;t my intention to make a &#39;distressed&#39; version  <BR>of
  the face &#40;my interest in distressed type is very low&#41;. In fact it&#39;s  <BR>an
  experiment: to create ink- and light-traps <i>through blurring</i>.  <BR>How did

  body: 'Regarding Stephen&#39;s name database idea, I think this is an excellent
    thought and would be very welcome. The main problem with the Goudy Center database
    is that they wanted to charge money for name searches, which put people off using
    it or even bothering to submit to it. <BR> <BR>FontLab now has a nifty &#39;Check
    at MyFonts.com&#39; button in the FontInfo naming panel, which goes off and checks
    to see if MyFonts lists any fonts with the name you are using. This is handy,
    but of course is limited in that it only checks the one source. If another freely
    accessible database were available, FontLab could check multiple sources and so
    provide more reliable feedback. <BR> <BR>Regarding the kind of abuse that Hrant
    suggests might happen &#40;people submitting cool names for as yet non-existent
    typefaces to prevent other people from using them&#41;, you can only legally claim
    trademark on a name that you are actively trading goods or services under in the
    marketplace. You are also legally obliged to defend a trademark: there is no automatic
    protection. So if I start selling a pair of fonts called Nour &amp; Patria, Hrant
    would be obliged to sue me or lose his trademark on the names. I suggest that
    names should be accepted for the database <i>only</i> if the submitter is claiming
    them as trademarks, i.e. submission to the database constitutes a trademark claim.'
