body: "Hey everybody, I went the simple route with this.  Got good advice from Armin
  on my previous post. Just want to see if anyone had a suggestion or two. It's not
  done. Interview is Wednesday, want to get early just to make sure nothings screwy.\r\n\r\nMy
  main concern right now is page 11 of the pdf. Dont know how thats working. I dont
  have the original files, all I have is pics, and the book. Also, I know you're only
  supposed to put 10-12 of your best pieces in your book. I'm presenting in letter
  format, and I have at least 2 projects ( books ) with more than 1  spread each,
  and thats pushing my page count up.\r\n\r\nPages 3-10. any ideas on how to narrow
  this down?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEric"

    view. \r\n\r\nFor narrowing the spread of pages in your publication (and to put
    some action on the page) you could use a vertical or diagonal grid composed of
    only one tile and various colums.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "I think that this way your work will be more economically and more interestingly
    displayed, maybe the stroke of the grid could be less strong. I think it would
    be ok to have at least a single plain view of each work, so the viewer can have
    some orientation about what he is seeing in the grid.\r\n\r\nFrom your previous
    sample I liked the clean layout and I think that now the tag is too big, a bit
    noisy. Maybe the upper right clear space is fine to fit the tag in.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
