  body: If it&#39;s a PC Truetype font, and you&#39;re using OS X, you don&#39;t need
    to convert the font.

  body: Really? If thats the case, that will be very helpful. Does it matter which
    version of OSX?

  body: I don&#39;t think so. OS X&#39;s system .dfonts have been PC Trutype fonts
    in disguise from the beginning.

  body: It is true that Mac OS X supports Windows TrueType fonts &#40;.ttf&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Resource-fork Mac TrueType fonts from Mac OS 7 and later, and Windows TrueType
    fonts, had always been related. The same structure that is in the .ttf font was
    placed in the &#34;sfnt&#34; resource of the Mac TrueType font, along with some
    other pieces of data.  <BR> <BR>Mac OS X introduced data-fork Mac TrueType fonts
    &#40;.dfont&#41; which was a repackaged form of resource-fork Mac TrueType fonts
    known from Mac OS 7 and later. Indeed, both sorts of Mac TrueType fonts include
    the same pieces of data that are included in Windows TrueType fonts &#40;.ttf&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>However, Mac OS X data-fork Mac TrueType fonts &#40;.dfont&#41; are closer
    related to Mac OS Classic resource-fork Mac TrueType fonts than to Windows TrueType
    fonts &#40;.ttf&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

  body: No, nothing special. <BR> <BR>But OS X&#39;s system .dfonts are not really
    PC TrueType fonts in disguise. They are Mac TrueType fonts in disguise. All that
    resource fork gunk has been stuffed into the data fork. <BR> <BR>T

    <BR> <BR>Non-Unicode Mac OS X applications use the cmap&#40;1,0&#41; encoding
    stored in the font. It can be controlled in FontLab Preferences / TrueType / Use
    following codepage to build cmap&#40;1,0&#41; table. By default, it&#39;s set
    to Mac OS Roman which is fine for most fonts so you don&#39;t need to change anything.
    Also, make sure that your font&#39;s metrics and naming are compatible with the
    recommendations:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=4356"
