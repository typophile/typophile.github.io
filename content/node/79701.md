body: "I'm having some specific kerning issues. Has anyone ever had inconsistent kerning
  show up in Photoshop, TextEdit, & Windows WordPad? Almost all the kerning for a
  certain font shows up, but there are glaring exceptions (for example, Ke, Ka, Ta,
  fo). These errors are the same for all three of these programs. The same text in
  Mac or Windows Illustrator is perfect. \r\n\r\nWith a different font, I have the
  same above problem except that the Windows Photoshop works perfectly while my Mac
  Photoshop does not. I have FontExplorer and have emptied all caches from applications
  & my system and still get the same problems in Photoshop. I realize most type work
  is done in Illustrator or InDesign, but it should still work in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"

    side and the Windows side of my cross-platform computer. More?

  body: "Do you have both flat kerning and OT {kern} feature kerning? If so, are both
    sets equivalent?\r\n\r\nI suppose it\u2019s possible that some applications are
    reading kerning data from one place and other apps from the other. That could
    explain the discrepancies.\r\n\r\nBut I couldn\u2019t say for sure. Just a guess.
    Something to look into.\r\n\r\nYou might want to post this topic in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/6\">Build</a>

    you use to generate the font? Did you follow the instructions for properly generating
    a font using your font software? And if you\u2019re using kerning classes have
    you examined them for errors?"
