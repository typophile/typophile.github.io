  (those fine  mostly endlessly repeating lines found on paper money or identity documents).\r\nI
  already tried to find by the keyword \"guilloche\" but that wasn't successful.\r\nDoes
  anybody know of a font, which will build those patterns or at least quite similar?\r\n(I
  know Hypnopaedia and similar, but that doesn't really fit. I need more linear patterns.)\r\nThanks
  for all hints!\r\nbest regards\r\nMichael"
