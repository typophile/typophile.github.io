  body: "Effective lively effect for monoline connecting lettering consisting of straight
    lines.\r\nHowever, it would be very difficult to make a connecting script like
    this because the connecting strokes join the letters at a wide range of angles.\r\nNote
    how the angle of the stroke leaving _e_ is a perfect match for the upper left
    segment of the stoke for _c_. But try to join it to another _e_ and there would
    be a kink at the join. Try a double _e_ or _c_ with _e_. Kinks in every case.
    The kink is even more abrupt with combinations of the other letters in the sample.\r\n\r\nI
    trust that some font makers have experimented with straight line segments for
    connecting scripts, perhaps in the context of neon sign design. It might be worth
    checking sites like Creative Market and Dafont.\r\n\r\nSome fonts combine the
    idea of straight line segments with curved ones.\r\nFor example Master Script
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MasterScriptAsBeckyG_4048.gif] https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/master-script/
    uses the same angle for all connecting strokes and for some portions of letters
    made from straight lines. The letters are a combination of straight and curved
    strokes. Consider the character set of Master Script, as shown at Identifont \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MasterScript@Identifont_4444.gif]
