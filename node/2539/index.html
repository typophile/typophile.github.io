It's not often that I find clients tha treally don't care for logos, it's the name that counts (and I agree on some extent, depends on their business &amp; mainly clients). Maybe it wouldn't be fun to have all the &quot;no logos&quot; on arial.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For clarity's sake, let's define a &quot;mark&quot; as a non-type graphic with or without accompanying logo type, &quot;type&quot; as a written/typed out name without a graphic, and ignore the merging element of a &quot;typemark&quot; (i.e. monogram) to avoid confusion. <BR> <BR>I believe the type or size of a business or industry is irrelevant to whether or not a &quot;mark&quot; (vs. type) should be used to identify it. The process of designing an identity includes discovering a party's unique characteristics, relative to their industry and their goals/objectives, then capturing your findings in a mark or typographical logo. How can you assume one will work better than another without applying the design process to the individual project. <BR> <BR>I have only been pursuing self employment for about five months now, after spending seven years working for in-house corporate design groups. One of the greatest benefits I have found working on my own is that I have enough control over my projects to individualize each one of them, instead of regurgitating portions of old projects. In the corporate world, the statement &quot;don't reinvent the wheel&quot; is practically a chant. I understand the concept of not throwing out everything you have learned, but I believe the statement is often used as a copout to avoid going through the design grinder (here design is used in its most general sense, as almost every discipline requires some form of design&hellip;see dictionary definition). It irritates me to hear or read that some designers are promoting what in my opinion is an unsubstantiated limitation to my control over individual design projects. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree, in general, with Zato and HD there. Most small/medium clients know they need a unique identity but only know how to ask for a &quot;logo.&quot; <BR> <BR>But when it comes to the actual design process I agree with Scott. I wouldn't rule either out without judging the merits of each, against the requirements of the project. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is an essay's topic. (No, none is coming up right now.) <BR> <BR>In general the quote says nothing wrong. If you don't have to say anything important: &quot;shut up&quot;. <BR> <BR>My bakery never told me someting intelligent, so their logo wouldn't tell me anything else (ignoring that they don't really have one, since it's times not even arial) <BR> <BR>But even me doesn't really care nor do the hundreds of people that also buy their bread there, if the CI of the bakery is good or not. <BR>as long as the bread is OK. <BR> <BR>To propose some philosophic thoughts: &quot;Do you really need need to design public space? Would you really like a totally designed world and public space arround you?  <BR> <BR>I know the thougts jump arround a lot, but I hope you understand the point I am aiming at. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR> <BR>P.S.: I agree that the variation in the field of using different typefaces could increase, but only if it fits to the company and its suroundings. <BR>(Might be a bit idealistic, but there have to be some of those folks, too.) <BR> <BR>P.P.S.: No this is no neglection of graphic design but not everone needs it, because most people would lie if they had a perfect image (I couldn't deal with being approached nicely by the women working at my bakery (this might by different in the USA). <BR> <BR></div>
