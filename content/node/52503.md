  body: "<em>Trying to dig up a little info on the Double Crown Club</em>\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you want to know? The 399th dinner was last night, at the Savile Club, Brook
    Street, where after a Pressed Game Terrine we had Roast Breast of Goose finished
    with Mustard-flavoured Brussells Sprouts and Potato Fondant, followed by Warm
    Chocolate Fondant finished with Cinnamon Ice-cream and Mulled Wine Syrup. There
    was a good white wine from the Ard\xE8che. The red was a decent claret. The choice
    of pudding was artful, since the speaker was Jerry Cinamon, who spoke on Rudolph
    Koch, showing slides of original artwork that he made at the Klingspor Museum
    and which were completely new to most of us. The menu was set in Koch\u2019s Jessen
    type, the one for which he cut the punches directly in the metal without making
    drawings, or so he said.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go further back, the official history
    is by James Moran, <em>The Double Crown Club : a history of fifty years</em> (1974),
    but there are references, complimentary ones on the whole, scattered over several
    studies of the British typographical scene in the 20th century.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Florian. Are you a member? Judging by your description of the meal
    I am guessing yes. As a starving student, I'm not adding to my library at the
    moment, but I did come across a link to that book. Is this a members only club?
    If so, how does one get accepted? I am particularly interested in the menus you
    design. Is there somewhere online where one can view them? It would make a wonderful
    site.\r\n\r\nKent, you are correct. What a marvelous storyteller Mike is. I was
    looking for some information on Times Ten as I am using it for some materials
    in an experiment. Stephen Coles suggested I contact him directly.\r\n\r\nAnd I
    figured out the wiki stuff. It makes sense now.\r\n\r\nThank you both."

  body: "Well, I\u2019m not Florian, but I\u2019ll do my best to tell you how to join
    the Double Crown Club. Get to know a member, and maybe he or she will propose
    you for membership, and if the members like the sound of you, and the look of
    what you have designed or printed, you are in. It\u2019s a dining club, though,
    and you need to get to dinners regularly. Still, if a member takes you as a guest,
    you get a free dinner, and if you get too many such free dinners, people think
    you should join and pay for your own. Like most such groups it tends to think
    of itself, rightly or wrongly,  as (literally) an \xE9lite. At any rate, it did
    in 1924 when Stanley Morison and Oliver Simon were among the founders. Mike thinks
    that it was a conspiratorial coterie of men (they were all men) who thought rather
    too well of their superior good taste. I wouldn\u2019t say that he is wrong. \r\n\r\nWe
    are quite different now, of course. But whatever the quality of the speaker (being
    human, they vary), we still appreciate attention to a decent standard of food
    and wine, as well as good typography, like the club\u2019s founding fathers. Here
    is a detail of Tuesday\u2019s menu. (There are plenty of other examples in James
    Moran's book.) If I understood the story that was given out at dinner, Jerry Kelly
    (one of the club\u2019s Honorary Overseas Members) provided the Jessen-Schrift.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DCC

  body: "Thank you James. Is it to much to ask to be provided with a list of current
    members?\r\n\r\nI'm also curious if there are \"satellite clubs\" of sorts out
    there.\r\n\r\nShould I ever receive a guest invitation, I like the sound of a
    free meal, but, as a staving student, flying to London for dinner is certainly
    beyond my means. Unless of course I can write an extremely clever grant proposal.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I understand that it is someone's responsibility to \"design the menu.\" Does
    that mean typographically as well as select the food, or simply the typographic
    design? If it is just the typography, does the chef send the evening's meal in
    advance to the selected presenter?\r\n\r\nPlease keep me informed regarding the
    400th dinner, and thank you very much for the image. If you have any others that
    you would care/are allowed to share, I would love to add them to my presentation
    archive. You may email them directly to me at\r\n\r\ntypographer@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThank
    you.\r\n\r\n\r\n(I am going to try to have the title of this thread changed to
    \"Double Crown Club\" without the broken wiki mention.)"

  body: "There is nothing quite like the Double Crown Club, or so its members would
    have you believe. In London there is also the Wynkyn de Worde Society, set up
    in the late 1950s, which has lunches in the middle of the day instead of dinners
    in the evening. I am not sure it would like to be thought of as a satellite. It
    used to be business-like rather than gentlemanly, and it was hard-drinking, and
    thick with smoke too I should think. But it has probably settled down in its old
    age, and appeals to people who do not live in London and who want to get back
    home in the evening. And who can spend three hours or so on lunch. A few people
    belong to both clubs. A great many people have never heard of either of them.\r\n\r\nA
    different designer is responsible for each menu and for the invitation or advance
    notice of the dinner, and some of these are well worth looking at. As I said,
    Moran\u2019s book reproduces several from the past, but there is nothing quite
    like seeing the the colours and special papers of the originals. The designers
    and the speakers are not encouraged to interfere with the choice of the food.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the names of members of the Club, these are for other members only. Maybe
    not everyone wants his or her membership to be widely known. \r\n\r\nHere is the
    only other bit of printing for the club that I could find immediately, quite a
    small one. (I\u2019ll send one or two others to you directly if I can find them.)
    It is the invitation to the 140th dinner, which was in 1957, a joint event with
    the Gezelschap Nonpareil, a Dutch typographical club. It took place at All Souls
    College, Oxford, and the speaker was Harry Carter, talking about \u2018Dutch Types
    and Oxford Printing\u2019. The invitation was set in the \u2018Fell\u2019 types
    and printed at the University Press. I am not quite sure how I got it, but I kept
    it because it uses an ornament that I am fond of, a 16th-century design that is
    attributed to Robert Granjon. It used to be cast at Oxford from a pair of original
    matrices.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DCC - invitation to Dinner 140
