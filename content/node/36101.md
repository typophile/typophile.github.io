body: "I would like to hear suggestions & criticism so I can do it better next year.
  \r\n\r\nIs there too much (or too little) of something? \r\n\r\nFor example : One
  change I made this year was that I didn't start posting images until well after
  TypeCon was over. The previous year I tried to get them up that night. This let
  me take way more shots. Did you notice or care one way or the other?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  as I have been posting photos taken at TypeCon to our Flickr Stream I have been
  adding explanations and descriptions. Sometimes it's just names but also in some
  cases it's a little bit about what the talk was about. I wanted to encourage those
  folks who were there to add descriptions of what they heard & thought was well.
  That way folks who couldn't be there can get more out of the photo stream.\r\n\r\nI
  have been geotagging my images. Does anybody care about this at all? Or is it just
  silly?\r\n\r\nAnd finally - does anybody want to help me shoot or process or post
  images for TypeCon 2008 in Buffalo?\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the stream:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/typecon/pool/\r\n"

  body: "One thing that I've noticed is that some photos are tagged with \"typecon2007\"
    instead of being tagged with \"typecon\". That is leaving some photos out of a
    standard search. \r\n\r\nAs to the stream, I think it is nice that things are
    coming in as a gradual thing. It gives you more reason to keep checking it, rather
    than one and done.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked the geotagging, but is it specific
    enough to the location, such as which restauraunt people were eating at? That
    might prove useful if somebody were to want to return."

  body: "Thanks Dan!\r\n\r\nMy geotagging is specific to the block but not a physical
    address.\r\n\r\nI will have to look & see if any of my photos have the 'typecon2007'
    defect. BTW You can add tags too. If you see one like that feel free to add 'typecon'
    & '2007' to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I only noticed it on some of Stewf's pictures, and I corrected that. No biggie.
    Yours are fine.
