  would be much appreciated\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/display/Narziss/"

  body: I wouldn't like this suggestion, but looking at it I get that Helvetica might
    work.

  body: Ha, yes I tried this (even though I did want to avoid it). The 'O' is too
    round, I think I would like to find something with similar proportions and x-height.
    Thank you for the suggestion though  ; )

    a look <a href=\"http://typematters.de/tmt_h11.html\">here</a>. I\u2019m thinking
    of the last one in the row in particular."

  body: "Hum\u2026 I'm not sure what you meant, renkceurb. If you're talking about
    Narziss being a bit condensed-looking you might have to consider that that's only
    because it can afford to, since it's a display face. Something with similar structure
    but for smaller sizes usually has to be a bit more open. Not that I know exactly
    what I'm talking about. :P\r\nBut classics, what about Univers, Akzidenz Grotesk,
    or even, further away, Gill or Syntax? Maybe [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/flama?page=2|Flama]]
    or [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=bau&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Hamburgefonstiv&sample_size=48&update=0|Bau]];
    the latter would be my favourite, I think. There's also [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/preface/|Preface]].
    I think all of those share something with Narziss\u2026"

  body: Thanks Ruben, I ended up settling on an old classic (Akzidenz Grotesk), which
    I haven't used in a long time. I was just wondering if anyone had used Narziss
    and what they teamed it with.
