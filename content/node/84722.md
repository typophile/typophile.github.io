  body: This is very close to News Gothic (and therefore Trade Gothic and, to a lesser
    extent, Franklin Gothic). I couldn't find a version of News Gothic with a middle
    arm that's nearly the same width as the top and bottom ones, but that might be
    a customization (look at the smaller type). The join at the vertice of the A is
    different in this sample, too.
