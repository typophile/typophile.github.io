  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello again,</p>
<p>it has been a pretty long time :)</p>
<p>I was recently pretty busy designing a logo for Bernhard Kohl. He is a former professional cyclist who started his own bike and fitness shop 3 years ago. At the end of this year his franchise contract ends and so the shop needs a new name, new logo, new everything.</p>
<p>I will try to keep it short: We have already decided on the letters B and K to be represented in a logo. No real innovation but OK.</p>
<p>There are 2 versions I would like to get your expertise and your impression on. Version 1 is the one that has already been approved by our client. At first glance it is just a capital B with 2 diagonal strokes. At second glance you should be able to see a capital K. Everyone seems to like the concept (that is why it has been approved) but somehow I am not satisfied with it. I think the K looks strange.</p>
<p>Version 2 is still fresh and so I am not really objective about it. I can only say that I think it is more iconic and clear-cut which makes it a better logo in my opinion.</p>
<p>If we had to decide for one of these two versions, which one would you pick?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>@apul: In the whole process I have never been able to convince myself to making the crossbar the same angle like the lines because I was too afraid of loosing the B. Maybe I should give it a try before I give up on this idea.</p>
<p>@JamesM: Thank you for the tip with the thick vertical bar. Really a great observation.</p>
<p>@apankrat: I have already tried to make the middle part of the logo an actual K and tried to blend it into a B. I have uploaded three of my favorite versions of this part of my journey. And thank you for your hint about the wrong URL. I have updated it.</p>
<p>@Luma Vine: Your comment sums it up nicely. Version 2 ist clear but dull and version 1 has potential but is not there yet.</p>
<p>It is great to get this kind of feedback. I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>After some days have passed, I am back again to the original version :)</p>
<p>I have changed the angle of the strokes and made them a little thicker. This way the K becomes more obvious and the logo does not become too blurry at smaller sizes.</p>

I agree with hhp&rsquo;s comments about the counter shapes, and his bottom-most design, with somewhat wider stripes, makes both the B and the K more obvious. My personal preference was for the more angular versions of the B-K combo - they were clearer if less artistic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be cautious about an approach like that. I used to do design work for a large corporation that had an angled logo and it often caused problems because optically it sometimes looked &ldquo;crooked&rdquo;. Or to be more specific, the elements in it that were actually horizontal (like the white stripes in yours) would look slightly off, even though they weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Basically what I did was to combine hrant&rsquo;s second and third version. I took the counters of number 2 and the wider strokes of number 3 and tried to be very careful about the negative shape so the B does not end up looking strange.</p>
<p>I am pretty satisfied with what I have right now and would love to hear your opinions about it:</p>
