  knows the sans used in this image? Think they also used it for the custom logotype?
  Or is the logotype another font?\r\n\r\nThe only font I can find is Lunchbox wich
  is a non official non matching font with the current logotype.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Snickers logotype is custom, but I believe you can find a font based on it on
    dafont.com (it\u2019s not a great match, but close)."
