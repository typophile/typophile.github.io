body: "Hello all,\r\ni have few problems understanding the type measurement, while
  i was reading the book (Designing With type) the author was talking about how you
  measure type in picas and points and that the (1 pica makes 15 point), and i am
  getting more and more confused with those measurement and i would love if someone
  could tell me more about it and explain it and what is it used for and how it would
  help me with my typography.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Not sure where you read that in Designing With Type but there are 12 points
    in a Pica and 6 Picas in an inch. Exact measures have changed over time but this
    is the current standard.\r\n\r\nIt's possible you're confusing points (typographic)
    with pixels (digital) or dots (halftone printing) which are not the same. Both
    pixels and dots are a variable measure and can contain any number per standard
    measure (e.g. 300 ppi or 1200 dpi)."

    pica makes 12point not 15.\r\nthanks for the correction and yeah i am getting
    confused by it also i would love some great explanation from you guys, what does
    it help me to know these measures for a line and what is it used for.\r\nThanks"

  body: "Picas and points are the north American system. I think there is a different
    French/European system using Didot points and ciceros. I don't know the rules
    on that.\r\n\r\nPoints were developed in the late 19th century, and at the time
    metric was largely unknown in the Americas. Points were chosen to provide a means
    of expressing type measurements. Up to that time, type was measured arbitrarily
    with measurements called agate, pearl, primer, and many more. I think Pica was
    one of those type sizes and the point worked out to be 1/12 of this.\r\n\r\nUntil
    1970-80 there was a point that was 72.27 to the inch. Computer programmers didn't
    like that, and they rounded it to 72 to the inch, which makes it much easier for
    you to remember. The changeover was hell on typesetters though, as we had to compensate
    for the difference, which builds up to a third of a line on a full A4 page.\r\n\r\nNow,
    if you really want to be confused, look up the dimensions for the en and em."

  body: "Actually, a point was always \xB9\u2044\u2087\u2082\u2033; it's the size
    of the inch that varied!  Can't recall what standard Fournier used, but Didot
    used an inch \xB9\u2044\u2081\u2082 the size of the French legal foot, with his
    point \xB9\u2044\u2087\u2082 of that.  And of course the Adobe PostScript point
    is \xB9\u2044\u2087\u2082 of the current U.S. inch.\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel"

  body: "Points and picas are artifacts of an archaic technology, like cubits and
    furlongs. \"Point size\" refers not to any measurable dimension of the letters
    themselves, but to the pieces of metal the letters would be sitting on, if they
    were sitting on pieces of metal, which they're not. \r\nLook at this diagram.
    At the lower right it shows why two alphabets that differ visibly in size can
    both be called 24-point type.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_5489.gif]\r\nWhen
    designers had to write specifications to be carried out by typesetters, it was
    very important to specify point sizes precisely, especially because there often
    were no intermediate sizes: If 24-point was too big, you had to use 18-point.
    \r\nNow that designers do their own typesetting, and can adjust sizes in minuscule
    increments, you can customize size and spacing any way necessary to make the type
    look good, read well, and fit the required space. Points and picas are just a
    way to measure what you did so you can do it that way again. \r\n<em>Designing
    with Type</em> is a great book--I used to use it for a course I taught--but it's
    a revised edition of a book published 38 years ago, and it still assumes its readers
    have letterpress as a frame of reference. Don't get hung up on the imaginary slab
    of metal. Just make it look good, read well, and fit. "

  body: "> it\u2019s the size of the inch that varied!\r\n\r\nReally? I did not know
    that. The US and UK inches have been the same size for the past 500 years. What
    nations have had different inches?"
