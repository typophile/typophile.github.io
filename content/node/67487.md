  body: I posted this same request yesterday and eventually solved it myself. It's
    Sentico Sans DT or a close second is Klavika. My guess is Sentico but the 'K's'
    don't look quite the same. Still trying to find my other font request posted yesterday
    as they both came from the CTV Olympics website.

  body: "I FOUND IT AT LAST! It is neither Sentico Sans nor Klavika. It is in fact
    \"Stainless\" from Font Bureau. It comes with all the fonts including the wide
    version I was looking for as well.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless]]"
