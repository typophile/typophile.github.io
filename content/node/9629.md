  Word or are the notepad style editors all the rage? Also, has anyone had success
  with a barebones text editor for Windows? My current workflow looks like this: <BR>  -Word
  for text input <BR>  -apply styles to inline quotes, headings etc. and save as .rtf
  <BR>  -import into Indesign with analogous paragraph styles set up <BR> <BR>I would
  like to take Word out of the loop as it eats up a lot of ram and is often unstable.'

    more like a cardbox. I quit using editors like notepad for text transfers to InDesign
    altogether because this little program is so extremely useful. Best thing is that
    you can collect all texts for a project at single pages each in one folder without
    having to save each single file separately. Of course you can export the pages
    or folders as well, if you prefer. Can&#39;t imagine ever living without ... <BR>
    <BR>At the moment it&#39;s in german, but there are icons, too, and actually you
    don&#39;t need the menu, because if you&#39;re accustomed to work with windows

  body: The best text editor I&#39;ve ever used is my beloved <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com">UltraEdit</a>
    &#40;for Windows&#41;. Adam Twardoch also swears by it. <BR> <BR>I use Notepad
    for testing complex script OpenType fonts, because there is less application architecture
    between the font and the output, so it is a more reliable environment to confirm
    exactly what the Uniscribe text engine is doing for a given writing system.

  body: Jon, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll bite -- I use &#39;vim&#39; for all of my text editing.  No
    need to touch the mouse, lots of regular expression support, and with vim, you
    get syntax highlighting, auto indenting and a wide range of other very useful
    features. <BR> <BR>Probably not what I&#39;d use if I was on a Windows or Mac
    machine and was putting text into InDesign, but the fast and efficient vim is
    perfect for the fast and efficient editing of TeX documents. <BR> <BR>Cheers!

    The vi vs. emacs wars may continue. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m on Mac OS X and find Pico
    is fine for the small amount of editing I do in a Terminal window. Are there complelling
    reasons to consider editing text exclusivly in the Terminal with vi/vim/emacs/whatever?
    I do a fair amount of hand coding of XHTML. And another thing, just how easily
    are these programs learned? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: I use Word, much as I detest its bloatedness and the way it tries to correct
    my prose. <BR> <BR>Up until last year, when I switched to OS X, I had been using
    the 1991 version 5, as a matter of principle &#40;one small blow against the general
    practice of being milked for yearly upgrade fees; kudos to Microsoft for the backwards
    compatability feature of newer Words&#41;. <BR> <BR>The main reason I use Word
    is that it&#39;s the standard, and people are always sending me documents in it.
    If I stop using it, I will forget how it works, or become accustomed to something
    alse, and then when I do have to use it, the air will turn blue.

  body: Jon, <BR> <BR>I think there are considerable advantages to doing text editing
    in vim or emacs, especially when you&#39;re doing editing of structured text &#40;like
    XHTML, TeX, or programming languages&#41; because the editors can assist you in
    a variety of ways.  Syntax highlighting &#40;showing valid XHTML tags in a different
    color from text, etc.&#41; and auto-indentation can be a real lifesaver.  The
    code is easier to maintain if it&#39;s properly indented, and syntax highlighting
    makes it easy to see simple mistakes like failing to close a quote or tag. <BR>
    <BR>More general features of real text editors like vim or emacs include the ability
    to move inside your document quickly and easily, regular expression support &#40;which
    allows for really powerful search and replace&#41;, and the fact that you don&#39;t
    need to take your hands off the keyboard to move the mouse because the editing
    commands are all keystroke commands. <BR> <BR>But the sticky bit is what you ask
    &#34;just how easily are these programs learned?&#34;.  Well, they&#39;re not
    particularly easy.  emacs is probably simpler to learn because when you start
    up the program, it behaves much like pico -- you can type and words appear.  vi
    has multiple &#34;modes&#34; of operation and typing only produces words when
    you&#39;re in &#34;insert&#34; mode.  It&#39;s confusing at first.  The other
    confusing part about vi is that the movement keys are &#39;hjkl&#39; &#40;left,
    down, up, right&#41;, but because these are under your right hand, it makes moving
    about the file very fast. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure there are many quick introductions
    and tutorials on the Internet that will get you up to speed quickly &#40;vim has
    one built in as part of the help -- &#39;vimtutor&#39;&#41;, but it will take
    a bit of effort to get up to speed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been using vi for around
    ten years, and I still discover new features and tools that I wasn&#39;t aware
    of.  Learning how to use all the power of a real text editor can take a long time!

    just how much time I am willing to invest right now but I&#39;m a sucker for trying

    I know this only too well, but for me I can live with the pain. It&#39;s in one
    of those poorly placed mislabelled menus someplace... <BR> <BR>&#40;&#42;&#41;What
    I have been noticing is this: <BR> <BR>Many people don&#39;t know that alternatives
    exist or even that documents can be created with tools other than Word. <BR> <BR>And
    further, if you do decide to take a minority position &#40;for whatver reason,
    sound or not&#41;, the problem is mind share and perception. <BR> <BR>The perception
    is that if my word processor opens the file but it displays differently from the
    Word doc, my word processor is at fault. If my word processor document is opened
    in Word and it looks different from its original, it must me my word processor
    that is broken. It&#39;s the prevailing illusion that Word is the program, not
    by which others should be judged, but to which others should conform. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    too bad because what could be promising alternatives like OpenOffice.org suffer
    horribly by trying to act and interact like Word and its Office siblings. There
    is a huge opportunity to do things a little &#40;or much&#41; more differently
    and make things better than Word. <BR> <BR>Jon'
