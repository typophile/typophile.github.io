body: "I'm currently trying to figure out whether H&J works with the CJK composer
  in Adobe InDesign. I have the Chinese version of InDesign CS6, it seems quite problematic
  when I try to layout CJK text which has a few words in English inside; wondering
  if H&J in CJK typography is supported by InDesign at all?! \r\n\r\nI understand
  CJK composer works quite differently in InDesign\u200A\u2014\u200Ait uses the monospaced
  character grid system to place the glyphs. The spacing between Chinese characters
  (Kanji) cannot be less than zero, and the space between Chinese characters and punctuation
  marks & Latin letters are done by Mojikumi (compressing the punctuation marks) instead
  of kerning. And when set justified, you wouldn't see any *kerning* value of specific
  glyphs even if their location is shifted/changed for optimal spacing, as opposed
  to the default Adobe paragraph/single line composer where in the character panel
  these kerning values are shown/indicated. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone on this forum have
  any idea as to this issue? I appreciate any kind of suggestion and sources of information;
  and if the above definition is accurate. "
