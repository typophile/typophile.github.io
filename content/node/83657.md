  search for an answer an Typophile requires a 4 letter minimum for search queries.\r\nWhat
  does a \"Pro\" font mean exactly? I realize there are multiple language support
  and something about over 1000 glyphs, but I didn't know if there were other standards
  the family had to meet.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Pro is not a standard but a commercial designation used to identify fonts
    with additional glyphs and features supported by OpenType format. Initially, Adobe
    introduced this term to distinguish their renewed OT fonts from the standard ones
    (which are just Type1 fonts converted to OT format). Quickly, most foundries began
    to use this word to promote their products, with a variety of criteria (or the
    absence of any).\r\n\r\nUsually, a Pro font includes wider language support, sometimes
    with more than one script (Latin, Cyrillic and Greek is a common set up). These
    fonts often include small caps, oldstyle and tabular figures. Some also offer
    swashes, additional symbols, fractions and some Mathmatical signs. A few ones
    are more complete, with alternate glyphs, language-aware substitutions, super
    and subscript, technical symbols, dingbats, flourishes, combining diacritical
    marks, etc.\r\n\r\nThe number of glyphs is not a criteria to identify a Pro font,
    but of course fonts with larger sets of features would have hundreds or even thousands
    of glyphs. Finally, please note that some foundries and designers simply do not
    use the Pro term altough their fonts are very complete (see, for example, recent
    Windows or SIL fonts, which are not Pro but include thousands of glyphs)."

    was pretty amazed to encounter an orange juice brand name bearing the suffix \"Pro\"."
