  body: "It's cast in metal, so it predates the advent of phototypsetting (c. 1950).
    \r\n\r\nLooks like an art deco inline display face, but I've had no luck with
    an ID.\r\n\r\nMy attempt at a somewhat clearer image, if someone else wants to
    take a crack at it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Z_5504.jpg]"

  body: "I had the exact same thought, Nick, but Ashely lacks the exaggerated serif
    details. \r\n\r\nIf it was a metal typeface, it had to be mass produced. I'll
    have to check my type specimens...."

  body: "The different angle of the terminals reminds me also of Neuland Inline (minus
    the serifs).\r\nAt least the FFD cut: http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/ffd-neuland/inline?SiteId=15"

  body: Maybe interestingly, the non-inline cut of Ashley Crawford has more pronounced
    serifs than the flared ones of the inline version (albeit not as straight as the
    sample).
