body: "I have been doing a western series for more than 10 years. The title type is
  placed on the graphic into photoshop. We never had any problems. A few months ago
  (you may remember my crying about the printer demanding the files be done in InDesign
  rather than Quark) the files were going out as requested by their printer. \r\n\r\nThe
  title type in the last two month print jobs doesn't seem to be trapping - there
  is a white halo around the type. The printer says it's my file preparation - but
  outside of the fact the pdf is made in InDesign to their specs -- and not Quark)
  -- there is no other change. It is still front cover in photoshop. I think the printer
  is not trapping properly on press... the old catch-22.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help and
  shed some light on this?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nJackie"

    multiply is pretty close). Maybe that is what they are complaining about. But
    the only reason they would complain is if they couldn't hold register on their
    plates. It's on them Jackie no doubt, but that still doesn't solve the problem.\r\n\r\nCould
    you get the same effect by placing the title in ID? Then you could set it to overprint.
    Of course if the title was white that would be a HUGE mistake\u2026 -:)\r\n\r\nIs
    the title a spot color by any chance?\r\n\r\nI also don't quite understand that
    the printer gets to tell you what program to generate a PDF with. It really shouldn't
    matter. Are they in love with CID encoded fonts or something?\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Hi jackie\r\nusually its the printers job to get the trapping sorted. which
    means\r\nyou just export as a pdf from indesign or you print to postscript and
    \r\nuse distiller to do the conversion to pdf.\r\nThe printer should have the
    ability to trap your pdf file with special\r\ntrapping software (heidelberg's
    supertrap). \r\nIf your printer is not able to provide this service, well change
    printer.\r\nor to get around it set the trapping yourself in indesign.\r\n\r\nindesign,
    under window, output, trap presets\r\n\r\ndouble click the default settings\r\ntick
    trap images internally, click ok.\r\n\r\nPrint to postscript as usual. But under
    output change the setting\r\nfrom CMYK to in-rip separation. \r\nAlso under output
    change trapping to application built-in\r\n\r\nnow hit print and distill the ps
    file with pdf-x3 settings.\r\n\r\nvoila...a trapped file.\r\n\r\nthe standard
    trap setting in indesign will trap indesign\r\ntext and elements. indesign text
    and elements to \r\nplaced image files. It won't trap illustrator files internally\r\nor
    to indesign text and elements.\r\n\r\nhope this helps (or better makes sense)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The printer should be able to trap pdfs. I think for me that there maybe
    some problem printing the indesign file. Some printers don't have a top notch
    prepress systems and, keeping up with the technology curve demands a lot of upgrading...\r\nThe
    pdf-x3 is a is a good option. But if you consider that there maybe a problem with
    the printer's workflow, you could try making a PDF-X1a which is a pdf level 1.2
    for Acrobat 5, and it should work even with legacy systems. Print from indesign
    to a ps file and distill as a PDF-X1a. That may help.\r\nAs to apply trap in the
    pdf the supertrap application is great, question is, the printer has that?\r\nApplying
    in-rip separations just work if the printers workflow has a top notch system.\r\n\r\nI
    am inclined to think the PDF is the best option (X1a)."

  body: "hmmm agl\r\nthe rip doesnt need to do anything as the trapping is already
    done in the pdf\r\n(it's not just setting the trap flag it actually traps the
    pdf)\r\nIt will also work with pdf x1a.\r\n\r\nI still think changing printer
    would be easiest."

  body: "The days when designers needed to know how to trap should theoretically be
    gone.  It's the printer Jackie, if you have no choice there are options here but
    ultimately you should either change printers or have a dialogue with them as to
    what exactly the problem is. Probably the former, not the latter\u2026\r\n\r\nFor
    newsprint sometimes I will place a small 100k stroke on a white object printing
    on a rich black background just in case - that's about as far as I take it.\r\n\r\nA
    printer who is doing their job will trap your files accurately for their press
    and the media they are printing on.\r\n\r\nBest of Luck!\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Thank you all for your comments and just getting back to me. Sometimes I
    feel I stand alone when I am about to say, \"it's the printer's fault.\" We have
    gone through an electronic age where everyone is busy pointing the finger - and
    no one is taking responsibility for their job. In fact, many don't even know what
    their job is anymore. And when it comes to spending money -- we are all trying
    to save a few dollars where ever we can.\r\n\r\nThank you again."

  body: "Any RIP will trap any file (eps, pdf, ps, etc), and it will trap all the
    vector. Generally when you rip a composite file (eps or ps) trapping doesn't apply:
    The rip will make the decision for you in a pre-setted system; some others you
    can actually edit the trap.\r\n\r\nBasically it is like this: vector will be trapped
    by the rip; Images are not trapped, unless you want it to be trapped (psd does
    that).\r\n\r\nJackie T, the important thing here is realizing the limitations
    some systems have and, you as a designer should consider such problems with files
    you produce. The more complex your artwork is, the higher possibilities for problems.\r\n\r\nWhen
    working with pdfs, pick the PDF-X1a - trapped or untrapped. Ah, Quarkxpress delivers
    excellent eps, ps files. The trick is distilling them to your needs: If the printer
    says \"files has to be in cs3\":\r\n\r\nRUN f-a-s-t!\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thank you all for trying to help. I have seen the files and found that the
    company that does the printing does not rip the files for trapping. They have
    left it up to my client to do. Strange how the industry has changed so much. I
    guess all the professionals have retired.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the photoshop
    document had display/logo type in it and needed a Trap of 2. (It only was at 1)
    That appears to remove the halo. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like, when we get the proof
    back, I'll gladly update you."
