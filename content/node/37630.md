  body: Bello is a lovely script font, and it looks great together with Sauna (also
    from Underware). All the Underware fonts have a certain feel that makes them work
    well together, I think.

  body: I agree, Bello is beautiful. It works best at larger sizes, because of it
    being so chunky.

    and your intended audience is important.

  body: "Thanks very much for your replies. I had a look at this font to be part of
    a logo. I found it struggled at small sizes and maybe it was a little too different
    from what's out there so I passed on it. I though about bello small caps, but
    wanted something a bit more solid, clean and simple, sans serif or serif, more
    formal I guess. The logos progress goes on but I still haven't found the right
    font. i want it to be individual, but simple maybe a contridiction. The fonts
    i've looked at have been chalet (overused) vag rounded (too playful) bello ( individual)
    itc serif gothic (looks nice but has copperplate elements that I don't like).
    I think I would like a geometric sans with some roundness or serif but without
    the acenders ending in a square like shape. The audience is magazine, below line
    work, publishers, individuals. I want to avoid looking to technical.\r\n\r\nThats
    nothing to do with bello, but I thought I'd give an explaination of sorts why
    I haven't gone with it. It is lovely though.\r\n\r\nNick I really love your beaufort
    font and have used it within magazines! thanks"
