    issues involved.\r\n\r\nSay what? Type design is type design. Licensing/IP issues
    are quite separate and apart from that. Two different fields of knowledge.\r\nOne
    of the problems I've run into personally, is that it sometimes seems as if I have
    to be both a mind-reader because I can't even find the EULA for a font, and when
    I do, I need a lawyer to understand it. (Bad sentence, that's two problems, isn't
    it?)\r\nAnyway, as someone who's done a lot of: download, test, download, test,
    download, test; of many fonts with \"open\" licenses, what I am licensed to do
    or not do is easy to grasp.\r\nWhen it comes to retail fonts, if the licensing
    issues are such that only an \"expert\" can understand them, then everybody loses.
    And, IMHO, it fosters non-licensed use.\r\n\r\nBTW - Garrick Van Buren of Kernest
    has consented to an interview to be published on <a href=\"http://readableweb.com\">Readable
    Web</a> shortly. I'll make sure he's questioned about your concerns, as I understand
    them to be.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nrich\r\n"

  body: "Umm, yea, what Richard said. Type design and foundry licensing issues are
    really separate things.\r\n\r\nGarrick has been talking to a lot of type designers.
    While I can't speak for him, I think he understands the concerns of a chunk of
    the industry. That said, that's no reason to stop the technology that's available
    from going forward. \r\n\r\nAlas, it's the same old issue/debate. The legal system
    and web technology are really two different realms. "

  body: "Stephen, \r\n\r\nI'd like to echo Richard Fink's point that existing font
    licenses aren't as easy to understand as they need to be - nor are all fonts licensed
    in the same way. \r\n\r\nMany existing licenses support @font-face. Others don't.\r\n\r\nKernest
    is only interested in offering the fonts that do.\r\n\r\n--\r\nhttp://blog.kernest.com\r\nhttp://garrickvanburen.com"

  body: "Good. Thank you Ray and Garrick.\r\n\r\n@stephen coles\r\nA part of what
    Garrick has done with Kernest is simply to take those fonts that are available
    for web use with @font-face and collate them, organize them, and categorize them.
    Along with the source of each font and it's licensing information.\r\nBone simple
    grunt work.\r\nAll of this stuff was out there for the taking by anybody. Kernest
    just brings it all together and then also gives you the ability to preview the
    font \"live in your browser\" and, if you find it convenient, use the font in
    your web pages via a link to Kernest's server.\r\n\r\nThere are others who have
    announced that they, too, will be competing in this new \"font services\" arena.\r\n\r\nIn
    this way, we are seeing, for the first time, a real-world hashing out of how @font-face
    works and how these fonts look and behave in different browsers.\r\n\r\nIf there
    is anything to fear, it's that there <strong>are</strong> quite a lot of \"free\"
    fonts. And they <strong>might</strong> look a little too good for comfort!\r\n\r\nBut
    soon, anybody with a browser can see for themselves, with their own eyes.\r\nWithout
    knowing a lick of HTML or CSS.\r\nNow, <strong>that's</strong> progress, no?"

    issues involved.</cite>\"\r\n\r\nthat there's some hype and investors around TypeKit,
    does not imply that they have this understanding of type and licensing. Whether
    they have or not -- they have their own interests for running such a business
    which may or may not coincide with type designers' or foundries' interests.\r\n\r\nThere's
    very telling wording <a href=\"http://blog.typekit.com/2009/05/27/introducing-typekit/\"
    target=\"_blank\">on their blog</a>:\r\n\r\n\"<cite>As a Typekit user, you\u2019ll
    have access to our library of high-quality fonts.</cite>\"\r\n\r\nThis indicates:
    They offer an infrastructure service around font access/licensing. For this to
    be of any value they need your and others' \"content\" or \"commodities\" -- typefaces.
    And they consider these typefaces already as \"<em>our</em> library\". (Imagine
    the Monotype or Linotype machine without any typeface available.)\r\n\r\nAn additional
    remark:\r\nThe amazing thing is that such a business model can exist only because
    some browser developers have an aversion against supporting EOT as only allowed
    format for @font-face.* If they would do, font embedding/linking were pretty straightforward
    and relatively safe, without need for additional \"services\".\r\n\r\n* Like Mozilla's
    John Daggett on the www-font list says,\r\n\"<cite>Obfuscated/compression schemes
    are fine but not if it implies that we make things harder rather than easier for
    some users.</cite>\"\r\nWell. What, other than that, would TypeKit do?\r\n\r\nKarsten"
