    irrelevant, and the last one (to the Linotype website) doesn't bring much\u2026
    But thank you anyway."

    issued in New York State, who died in Orlando, FL on July 12, 2003.  \r\n\r\nSome
    of the genealogy sites (most with 3 days to two weeks free one-time trial access)
    indicate that they have more information. At least one site indicated that there
    was an obituary in the Orlando Sentinel, but at the newspaper's site I did a search
    for the name with a date range of all of 2003 and it found nothing.\r\n"

    will investigate that. Thank you very much.\r\nSt.\r\n\r\nPS : if this is the
    man, he would have been 60 when he designed American Typewriter. Amazing."

  body: From what I've found, he worked with ITC's Tony Stan on American Typewriter,
    who lived from 1917-1987 or 1988, similar ages, which of course proves nothing.

    of American Typewriter are not readily associated with old, seasoned professionals.
    But those were the 1970s, so who knows ?'

    a novice type designer working on it.\r\nBesides this, I think I will more or
