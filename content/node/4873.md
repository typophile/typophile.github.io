    be improved, but it is great. The problem is that all the &#34;big guys&#34; doesn&#39;t
    like Apple too much. The applications on X are few and you cannot use it for your
    everiday work. Adobe, Quark and Macromedia are slow and dubious about supporting
    the new OS. Fontographer probably will never be ported as I read &#40;between
    lines&#41; on the macromedia forum. I think that Type designer community should
    start an open project with donation to self build a new font software for OSX,

  body: ' OS X is great once you get used to it. You know, learn the new key commands,
    and where in the h@%$ it puts everything.  <BR> <BR>As far as fonts go, Font Reserve
    is nice from what I&#39;ve seen so far and some of my other buddies swear by it
    now in X. I am slowing making the move over to OS X now as money permits upgrades,
    ha ha. Font Reserve will be the next purchase. <BR> <BR>InDesign rocks and I hope
    it completely kills Quark although the rumor mills say Quark is finally joining
    OS X in Jan 2003. Die Quark! '

    about previewing a flash, quicktime or  <BR>mp3 file in the finder?&#41; <BR>
    <BR>But the coolest feature that will never make headlines is  <BR>undos in the
    Finder. The days of accidentally moving  <BR>47 files into the wrong folder --
    with no way of knowing  <BR>which you moved or of easily putting them back --
    are  <BR>over. '

  body: Stephen, you can count on me to tell you about  <BR>features Mac users didn&#39;t
    know they wanted but <BR>can&#39;t live without. That is, as soon as I discover
    <BR>them for myself. <BR> <BR>How about the ability to open multiple documents
    from  <BR>an app&#39;s &#34;Open&#34; dialogue? &#40;Something Windows users  <BR>have
    been doing for years.&#41; <BR> <BR>How about working in one app while another  <BR>launches?
    &#40;True pre-emptive multi-tasking rocks.&#41; <BR> <BR>Those features alone
    are worth an average of about <BR>eight cents per day.

    clear who Apple is backing in the <BR>InDesign versus Quark race. No surprise,
    as <BR>a move to InDesign removes the barriers <BR>to OS X.

  body: Just back on the original topic of font tools for OS X for a moment.... <BR>
    <BR>FontLab has made increasingly frequent noises that suggest they are very close
    to releasing a FontLab 4.x for the Mac, which will be carbonized. <A HREF="http://www.fontlab.com"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.fontlab.com</A>. I won&#39;t be surprised if they unveil
    the application at ATypI in a week. <BR> <BR>Apple either has released or is close
    to releasing updated versions of many of their font tools to run natively in X.
    <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s Font Development Kit &#40;FDK&#41; for OpenType has both
    a classic GUI version and an OS X command line version. http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?14@@.ef93cf5
