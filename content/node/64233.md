body: "hello everybody, \r\ni'm looking for help on identifying this typeface. it's
  been used by OK-RM, seeing as they've been working together with aur\xE8le sack
  before, i thought it was one of his typefaces, but i couldn't find any info on his
  homepage.\r\nit also reminds a bit of the new unica version used for schauspielhaus
  z\xFCrich, but that's propably just the dots, the \"t\", \"o\" and \"A\" are very
  different.\r\n\r\nhere's a link to the homepage of the project. [[http://www.freetoair.org.uk/|http://www.freetoair.org.uk/]],
  [[http://www.ok-rm.co.uk/index.php?project=freetoair|http://www.ok-rm.co.uk/index.php?project=freetoair]]\r\n\r\nsome
  images are attached.\r\n\r\nany information is appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\ndan\r\n\r\n"

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neuzeit-grotesk/|Neuzeit Grotesk]] has
    the round dots, and other letters look pretty close. You could also customize
    AG with round dots, especially if you are only making limited words.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "hei,\r\n\r\nwell, it's not neuzeit grotesk, not even similar, because it's
    not a constructed grotesk. i still wonder what this could be ... the A looks really
    odd, the bar is a bit too high."
