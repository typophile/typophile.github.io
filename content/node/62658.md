body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI dabble in web design and graphic design, and I've been
  trying to develop a personal logo for myself that I really enjoy. The purpose of
  this logo would be to \"brand\" my web work, graphic work, and also maybe to print
  stickers.\r\n\r\nLet me clarify the purpose for this post: I want your guys' help!
  I want to know if you like this idea, what I should change about it, etc. I'd love
  to create an even better finished product with the help of the typographic champions
  on typophile.\r\n\r\nThe reason I approach you guys is because this logo is made
  entirely out of text, with a few edits.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching 2 right now. This design
  incorporates my three initials: D, L, and S. I wanted to be modern, slightly minimalist,
  and yet decipherable. I haven't extended the logos to colors yet, but I kind of
  like the grays feel. The purpose of having the year in the logo would be to instead
  of \"Copyright [logo] '09\" I could just do \"Copyright [logo]\". Maybe having two
  variations, one with the year, one without, would be better?\r\n\r\nLet me know
  what you think. I'm open to complimentary praise as well as [i]constructive[/i]
  criticism. I have no problem going back to the drawing board o this one to make
  the best personal logo ever!\r\n\r\nWohoo. Thanks for your help in advance!\r\n\r\nDavid"

    to be a concept, which is fine sometimes. If you're going to do a ligature (or
    sorts), perhaps try to make it interesting with some kind of perspective or something.
    One spot in particular that bothers me is the way the s runs into the bowl of
    the D. the stroke gets all gnarly and doesnt feel like it fits. You can fix that.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that helps!\r\n\r\n[http://evanmade.com]"

  body: "Hey Macursus! Thanks for your post. Do you think it's anorexic because the
    bowl of the \"d\" is so large while the stroke is so thin? And I know what you
    mean about the s and the d--I'll fix that! Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\n-- David"

  body: "in the lower part of the s as it meets with the backbone of the d it looks
    like a stylized 'P'. logos with just letters are tricky and since you admittedly
    dabble, do you have access to illustrator? you can get creative and show off your
    skills and have your logo be one of the things you're must proud of. i'd say use
    a serif font instead, the lowercase letters would be more recognizable and you'd
    have the benefit of the serifs to work with the interlacing of the letters.\r\n\r\ni'd
    recommend also letting the letters sit on the same baseline, the current logo
    looks topheavy to the right, like it could topple over.\r\n\r\na wispy font also
    runs the risk of being to thin it could be unreadable if you print it small enough
    and/or on a porous stock or labels.\r\n\r\nhope it helps and keep us in the loop
    on your progress.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled creativity,\r\n\r\nTroy Vera\r\nKingdom
