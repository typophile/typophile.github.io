  body: Certain design elements--similar to those in Behrens Roman, Helga Antiqua
    and Feder Grotesk--lead me to believe that it's from a German foundry, probably
    dating from 1910, give or take a few years. However, I can't locate a likely suspect
    in my specimen books, which also makes it unlikely that it has been digitized.
