  body: 'There seems to be some inconsistency with how interior corners are treated.  Some
    are rounded and some are square.  Compare upper left /D/ to upper left /m/.  Or
    the top of the /A/ vs. the peak of the /N/. '

  body: "Hi Gorgoyle,\r\n\r\nI'm no expert, also currently working on my first effort
    at a typeface :)\r\n\r\nMy first impression is that there are some unexpected
    widths in the uppercase, see /R/S/T/U. What sort of grid did you use?\r\n\r\nThe
    lowercase feels more consistent, although the bottom right corner of the bowl
    of the /e is bugging me, and I think should be square.\r\n\r\nI can see that you
    have carried the same corner radius from /D into the /E, but to me it feels like
    this has reduced its optical width slightly too much.\r\n\r\nAgreed the 2 and
    5 need work.\r\n\r\nGood luck with it - I realise how much stamina is required
    in this process!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OK I see I need to explain how font is derived, designed, whatever.\r\n\r\nHere:\r\nhttp://i43.tinypic.com/s6k7bs.png
    - Hi res image\r\nSave in your computer and see better in image viewer!\r\n\r\nGrid:
    1000pt hight,\r\nCapitals: 570pt, \r\nlowercases: 400pt, \r\nascender: 570pt,
    \r\ndescender: 570pt\r\nwidth: how I decide to optically be OK\r\n\r\nhttp://i39.tinypic.com/amwcar.png\r\n\r\nAlso
    basic idea for font was to be designed pretty and as possible with optical good
    \"look and feel\" and to be modular in same time. All glyphs to be modular...
    but that's impossible, so I got another font project which will be only modular
    with less optical balance in glyphs design.\r\nAlso basic idea for font is to
    be \"rounded and squared\" design, combination of Quad and Circle.\r\n\r\nI agree
    that X is maybe too narrow. I'll redo when I get some time... now I just posted
    to explain my font concept and last final version of letters and digits how they
    are at the moment.\r\n\r\nIdea for Zero was to make it different from Capital
    O letter, so I had to cut zero to \"nothingness\". I like both versions of Zero
    digit but I think uncutted Zero will make much more confusion than it looks nice,
    so for better functionality is better to pick cutted Zero digit."

    redesigned 3 times this font so far cause of data loss. But was for good! I'm
    now more better in font design than before, more studious."

  body: Well I just wanted opposite! To eliminate any dark joins for printing ink
    gaps. It's very modern and I think that today we not need ink gaps, in today's
    print-Press world.

  body: "Well, we can argue about the contemporary relevance\r\nof trapping* but I'm
    a little bit confused now because\r\nit seemed to me that you're trying to make
    something\r\nalong the lines of Eurostile, and compared to that design\r\na notable
    difference in your typeface is the dark joins...\r\n\r\n* For one thing I'd point
    out that many\r\nif not most accomplished type designers\r\nstill incorporate
    them in their work.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Before you expand the character set you really have\r\nto fix the weight
    inconsistencies: some parts of some\r\nletters are much darker/lighter than others.
    Unless\r\nthat's a rendering issue... In fact, why are the two\r\nverticals of
    the \"H\" different in thickness? If this <em>is</em>\r\na rendering issue, it's
    pretty impossible to tell how well\r\nyou've managed the stroke thicknesses, and
    we'd need\r\na PDF (or a much better rendering) to be able to tell.\r\n\r\nAre
    those renderings from Illustrator?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
