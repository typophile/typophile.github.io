body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Lining Figures</strong>\r\n\r\nLining
  figures, or ranging figures, are numerals which share a common height. Lining figures
  are often [[titling figures]], however they may be smaller and lighter than titling
  figures. Unfortunately, lining figures are the default figure style in most digital
  fonts where [[text figures]] would be more appropriate. However, this problem can
  be remedied in [[OpenType]] fonts which may offer several sets of figures to be
  used in different types of settings. Sometimes indicated as LF in the font's name."
