  I have been designing for a company named Media & Software Studio\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gen-3-Brand-1-4_03_5496.png]\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know what you think with particular regard to the following:\r\n1. Have I
  chosen a good base font to play with?\r\n2. Are the two s's legible????\r\n3. What
  can I do to make them more like s's without losing the simple elegance of the design?\r\n4.
  Have I treated the shapes correctly? I mean I see that the horizontal strokes are
  a tiny bit narrower than the verticals? Have I kept this consistent enough in the
  two s's?\r\n5. Is the second s joined appropriately? or is there a better way to
  make it flow/read correctly?\r\n\r\nI know I've asked a lot, but I'm a real novice
  and would appreciate any tips that come my way. \r\n\r\nThanks very much"

  body: "satya, \r\n\r\nThanks for your quick reply. I agree, they look like oo, actually
    they are based on the letter o, and then adjusted to look like ss, but something
    is missing, can you help?\r\n\r\nI tried to put a little peak on top of the o
    shape to imply an s, but it loses its simplicity. Also I have noticed that if
    you get the shape wrong you can easily imply a rude picture... ie. a woman's chest
    area! not good."

    logo, it really doesn't matter what font you have chosen cause anyway you gonna
    modify it. Until unless you are using that typeface itself as a logo.\r\n\r\n<em>2.
    Are the two s\u2019s legible????</em>\r\nNot at all. They looks oo to me. \r\nAlso
    these two oo's looking smaller than the m."

    of the slanted ess's, I have slapped together a sample using your recommendation,
    please let me know what you think. I'm not sure it still has it's simple elegance,
    but maybe you could give me pointers on how to refine it back to being elegant
    again, but legible this time!\r\n\r\nThanks guys[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gen-3-Brand-1-4_04_6134.png]\r\n\r\np.s.
    Just a thought, anyone, do I even need the & symbol in there? I put it in because
    of the visual attactiveness of it, but I'd prefer people to call it \"MSS\", not
    \"M and SS\", so could the logo be made even smoother without it? or is it quite
    sexy?"

    I read your question about the ampersand, I suddenly read the current logo as
    \"mess.\" Oh my! If you need another reason not to include it, that may be it.\r\n\r\n(If
    you decide to keep it, maybe play with color to help kick it away from the \"mess\"
    message?)"

  body: "I don't think you need the &.  Try some variations without it.  \r\n\r\nYour
    second version has the right idea, but needs some clean up.  Try the upward stroke
    on the left of the s as a straight diagonal line as opposed to the bit of curvature
    it has now.  Then, I'd have the right, downward stroke curve outward right away,
    instead of the little hook.\r\n\r\nAlso, try an 'm' without the top left vertical
    section, just a straight curve.  It might match the sensibility of the 's's better.\r\n\r\nAnd
    not that we're focused on the other parts of the logo yet, but you should play
    around with other typefaces for the formal name, as well as lockups.  The two
    styles aren't meshing well."

    not far enough to reach actual readability.

    the mean time here's just another version or the original concept. I am trying
    to maintain the simplicity that is clear in version that I attached in my very
    first post up top, but I'm trying to work the s's so they don't get confused with
    o's or backward c's. \r\n\r\nI've also tried to take on board some of the suggestions
    found in the comments by others. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your tips, I'm still
