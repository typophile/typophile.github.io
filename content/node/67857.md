  body: "Andrey,\r\n\r\n<cite>I can't find installer of python 2.3.6 for XP.</cite>\r\n\r\nOlder
    versions are indeed a bit tricky to find on the Python website. Maybe I should
    add a direkt link on my website.\r\n\r\nPython 2.3.5 for Windows can be found
    here:\r\nhttp://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3.5/\r\nwhich links to this
    installer file:\r\nhttp://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.5/Python-2.3.5.exe\r\n\r\nAs
    far as I know, FontLab does not support Python 3 at the moment, and RMX depends
    on the FontLab system.\r\n"
