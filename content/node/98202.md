body: "All right, here's a calendar I made.\r\n\r\nYes, it's designed for use in the
  USA (specifically for the vicinity of New Haven, Connecticut), but I did it on A4
  paper for a reason I will get to.\r\n\r\nI do not like conventional wall calendars.
  I think that they have both too much and too little information, and are badly formatted.
  So I made my own.\r\n\r\nI used DIN because I wanted to be able to read the numbers
  from across the room and I figured a road sign font would take care of that. I also
  wanted a font that was relatively tall and narrow so that it would leave maximum
  space for writing notes.\r\n\r\nI had made calendars like this (but with different
  typography) before, and it is a pain in the neck to type in all the numbers and
  information and get everything exactly right. So I decided to automate the process.
  I downloaded a spreadsheet for computing sunrise and sunset times, and then I modified
  it for purposes of my calendar. I used CorelDRAW for the design. I used the \"Print
  Merge\" feature to insert the data, and then I had to hand-tweak the typography
  to get everything to work right. For really tricky stuff I probably messed up, see
  the dates Feb. 3 and Nov. 3. For tricky stuff that I think I handled well, see the
  page headers for the year transitions.\r\n\r\nI am glad I finished the calendars,
  but I am really not satisfied with how things went.\r\n\r\n* CorelDRAW seems extremely
  temperamental. I only used it because of the 30-day free trial and the Print Merge
  feature. What other program has something similar to Print Merge that I could use
  to automate the creation of calendars?\r\n\r\n* I designed it for A4 paper because
  I intended to go a lot further with my automated (or quasi-automated) process. I
  wanted to make a whole bunch of calendars for different regions of the USA and the
  world and put them up for download. I was not aware that even a large office supply
  store in my area would not have A4 paper. (I really wanted to clobber somebody.)
  But constructing these calendars (I mean the files for printing, not the physical
  calendars) turned out to be more difficult than I thought.\r\n\r\n* I found fonts
  DIN Mittelschrift and DIN Engschrift. At times I wished for a font intermediate
  between these two. I don't suppose one exists.\r\n\r\n* The DIN Mittelschrift font
  I downloaded has a design flaw: the placement of the digit 3 is too far to the left
  compared to the other digits. One would think that whoever made the font would have
  seen this and repaired it. But I'm not going to pay $75 or so just to buy a program
  to edit one character."
