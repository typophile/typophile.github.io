body: I received a request from an OEM to resurrect one of my old freeware fonts,
  Pleasingly Plump NF, in 21st-century TrueType format. The font, originally designed
  in 1999, had an uppercase that leaned to the left and a lowercase that leaned to
  the right. By typing alternating upper- and lowercase letters, the user could add
  a decided bounce to the type. Given the advances in OpenType programming, it would
  seem that there ought to be some calt code that could do the heavy lifting of double-clutching
  the shift key...but perhaps not. Has anyone found an elegant solution to this problem?
