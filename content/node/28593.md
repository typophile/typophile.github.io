body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nWondering if anyone has any suggestions for possible typeface
  choices for a book about the human heart?\r\n\r\nIt's a small book (size & length)
  broken down into four sections, that deal with both the rational and irrational
  sides of the heart. I'm dealing with history, anatomical structure, emotion and
  symbolism, so I want an inviting typeface that's appropriate for both rational and
  irrational musings about the heart. Obviously some connection with the human heart
  is desirable.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at using a sans-serif for the body to give
  it a more contemporary feeling. It's not going to be long chunks of copy at once,
  so I think I can get away with not using a serif for the body. I've considered something
  like Vista Sans or Absara Sans for their contemporary feel and humanist approaches,
  but I'm second guessing myself now.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone can offer some alternate
  suggestions to get me on track.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any replies.\r\n\r\nNick\r\n\r\n[edit:
  I failed to mention that this is meant to be more of a design project than a reference
  source. I'm somewhat going for style over substance, with a heavy visual treatment.
  The importance of text and visuals is split 50/50. Having said that, all comments
  on traditional book design are more than welcome.]\r\n \r\n"

  body: Do you want the text to be read or do you want the font to be looked at. Don't
    be cute and use something like Vista Sans, it works for ad copy but for a book?
    Stay with something that will allow the reader to focus on the content of the
    book and its illustrations.

  body: "I was about to suggest Dolly as well; it's organic, and would complement
    the subject matter well, and reasonably contemporary in look. Plus, it has a really
    pleasant, even color that looks great even when used pretty densely.\r\n\r\nJLT\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\njlt
