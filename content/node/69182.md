body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI need to use AutoKern feature of FontCreator to generate and
  export kerning pair values for a huge count of glyphs (to be processed by a text
  parser). FontCreator exports kerning values for only coded glyphs. I need to export
  for ligatures. How can I force it to export all glyphs (even with no unicode associated)?\r\n\r\n(sorry!
  this post was sent on incorrect place before, on design forum)"
