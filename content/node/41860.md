  expand. They'd like a high end look..see themselves as \"premium, strategic, operational
  experts, using new approaches to take businesses to new levels.\" They'd like to
  appeal to retailers. possibly show movement or arrow. \r\n\r\nSo far I've used tarzana
  wide lowercase (love the a) with star above made using 3 lines, diff shades. a modern
  look with the movement in the mark rather than the face.\r\n\r\nAlso used Mrs. Eaves
  all uppercase (+ arrow in oval) for classic approach. (is this font outdated?)\r\n\r\nfonts
  that come to mind given the brief would be much appreciated! \r\n\r\n(also would
  love a sans serif suggestion..I have overused engravers gothic but love it.  love
  verlag (also like luxury) but expensive.)\r\n\r\nthanks for the help in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a visual identity, rather just a typeface. Once you have some sort of broader
    brand idea a lot of these decisions - choice of typeface, colour etc. become easier
    and more focussed.\r\n\r\nBtw if you need a typeface that cues luxury, [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=536&subpage=viewfonts|this]]
    could be a place to look.\r\n\r\n   "

  body: "\"do you have opinion on the faces?\"\r\n\r\nBoth Tarzana and Mrs Eaves are
    very expressive typefaces, but they also express very different things (Which
    was why I thought you're probably starting at the wrong end).  \r\n\r\nI don't
    know if Mrs Eaves is outdated, I live some distance away from the world of typographic
    fashion :). But if it's appropriate for the story you're trying to tell, that
    shouldn't be a concern. With brand identity, it can't be driven too much by what's
    hot this season.\r\n\r\n(Btw. You may want to post what you have done so far.
    People find it easier to respond to a specific piece of work.)"

  body: "The key to the luxury look is that you can afford to waste space.\r\nThat
    may be why faces that are markedly condensed or expanded look upscale, because
    they force one to space them out (copious letterspacing and/or leading) and use
    them large so that they don't look crammed or fill in.\r\n\r\nFaces with a small
    x-height, like Mrs Eaves, look upscale because they too are not designed to cram
    in as much text as possible; book face proportions for a leisurely read.\r\n\r\nAlbertus
    and Optima are elite because they're not your common or garden sans or serif.\r\n\r\n"

    of adding a recommendation to use something like Clearview because AT&T used it
    for that purpose so successfully. Maybe I just tunnel-visioned on the word new

  body: "Nick, yes, space is the why I chose the faces (didn't realize til your comment
    though)..ty\r\n\r\nThanks Scalfin, they would like to be luxury but cutting edge
    too. \"strategic, operational, but definitely premium, premium.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerned
    that it's looking like a tech co  or oil/gas using sans serif...name is made up
    so doesn't elicit any imagery. italic sans serif looks like shampoo/toothpste
    (+ not using blue/green)..keeping it very simple (colors-grey or brown with mustardy
    gold) but when use mrs. eaves with simple mark seems to contradict instead of
    compliment.\r\n\r\nall,\r\nVEry much appreciate input!!\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
