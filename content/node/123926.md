  And to know if it has ever been digitized.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/danmark-atter-frit_4959.png]"

  body: "As for _atter frit_ there no exact digital match that I can find to the six
    different letters [img:sites/default/files/old-images/aterfiDanmark1945SM2_5829.png]
    although the _a_ has a remote resemblance to the simplified sans serif fonts like

  body: "The phase _atter frit_ also has a remote resemblance to Harry Winters' \"Roslyn
    Gothic\" published by VGC in 1972. Digitized, with some changes,  by Red Rooster
    as Ryder Gothic [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RyderGothicAs_atter_6256.gif]

  body: "Sorry for not getting back to you, Don.\r\nI thought I would get an email
    notification when there was a reply. That must be turned off.\r\nThanks for taking
    time to check this.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to digitize this.\r\nThe thing is that I
    have had access to the actual wood types for this typeface.  There were no name
    provided for the typeface though. I have obtained prints of most of the basic
    letters in the latin alphabet. \r\nThey are all scanned and ready for digitizing
    it but first I wanted to know if that had already been done.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

  body: "Good project. Based on the sample shown, the design is coherent, distinctive
    and attractive. If it is digitized it must be in a very obscure location.\r\nDon"
