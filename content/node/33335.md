    too seriously. Also I think there were sevaral factors being isolated for their
    purposes which will vary with type in real life - apparent size of a glyph being
    the most important of these.  Am I right in thinking your statement was really
    an attempt at winding up the Typophile debate team into a classic frenzy?

  body: "jpad: no, that's too simplistic a read. A much more likely interpretation
    is that the visual system slices the image into spatial frequency bands, with
    subtly different processing depending on the frequencies involved. There's a study
    cited by Peter Enneson saying that 90% of the legibility of text is contained
    in a single spatial frequency octave. Relevant threads include:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/9736\">TYPO

    Oliva calls the process of differentiation \"perceptual grouping\", allowing the
    brain to perceive two distinct images (Einstein/Marilyn, groan) in the same place.\r\n\r\nIn
    reading, I would assume it allows the reader to process word-images (which extend
    into the blurry parafoveal region) first, and distinct from sharp letters. This
    model calls into question letter-based reading theories.\r\n\r\n"
