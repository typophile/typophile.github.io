    lettering&#34; respo.

  body: To my great shame, though I did not design the original &#34;For Dummies&#34;
    letters or the letters on the first couple of books, &#34;Macs...&#34; and &#34;PCs...&#34;
    I was hired to create the rest of the alphabet, plus some punctuation, since the
    titles of the first books were all done in the chalkboard lettering. I don&#39;t
    know if the letters were ever developed into a font, but I still have my original
    Illustrator file, which needs a lot of work on the compound paths. What can I
    say -- it was ten years ago. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m happy to send you what I&#39;ve
    got, and you can do whatever you like with it. If you turn it into a font, I&#39;d
    like it if you&#39;d call it Condescend. If you feel like waiting a month or so,
    I&#39;ll fix the bad compound paths before I send it. Otherwise I can just email
    you the file as it stands now.

  body: Well, you know where it&#39;s at when you want it. I&#39;m so sorry that that&#39;s
    my lasting &#40;actually, not that lasting, I guess -- my part of it, anyway&#41;
    contribution to type design -- I mean, type desecration. <BR> <BR>Chesh
