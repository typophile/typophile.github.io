body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI've been asked to design some truck lettering for a
  bakery truck.  The trucks have 18 foot, 26 foot, 53 foot bodies.  The bakery's logo
  is Script and I'm trying to decide on some serif fonts that are going to pop out
  and be easily read.  Does anyone have any suggestions  about what fonts might be
  suitable for a truck this large and that will still maintain a bakery feel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRay

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WPShinn.jpg]\r\nThat's nice Chris, I
    like the angled lettering on top and the fully connected condensed script.\r\nW.P.
    was my great grandfather, an upholsterer (as was his father etc.), and the store
    also sold used furniture etc. This picture dates from the 1900s. He later had
    a van (which was run by my grandad, who loved motors) to pick up and deliver,
    but come WW2 there was a huge demand for moving furniture out of London and storing
    it. Hence the \"Removals\" on the van picture, which dates from the 1940s. People
    were more interested in moving furniture out of harm's way than getting it reupholstered.
    I like the way the telephone exchanges had names, not numbers, as in Chris' photo.
    Sorry for getting off topic, but given half an excuse to show some nice old lettering..."

    think Clarendon has better readability though.
