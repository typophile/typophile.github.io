  + italic</a>\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n07-04-05\r\n\r\nhey. i'm working
  on my first serious typeface. my aim is not to create something highly original,
  but to get into the type and construction rules. now i got to a point of the process
  when some feedback would be very helpful for me. \r\n\r\nthank you for your critique,
  comments and advices.\r\n \r\n "

  body: "I like this, it has a hap-hazardous feel to it which gives it originality.
    I think the strokes are to be credited with that feeling, I've noticed that they
    taper at the top and fan out as your eye moves down. \r\n\r\nThe <strong>J/j</strong>
    is very unique as well. The only characters that don't seem to follow the tapering
    effect are <strong>h, n and m</strong>, they start with the taper at the top and
    the proceeding stroke starts thin, thickens at the apex of the curve and then
    thins out again. I think this works fine on the <strong>m</strong>, but the outside
    stroke should probably be consistent with the vertical, based on your serifs.\r\n\r\nThe
    <strong>a</strong> does seem to be inconsistent with the rest of the characters
    though. It's very top heavy and the bowl doesn't seem to support the weight well.
    I might try opening up the bowl more. The <strong>s</strong> feels as if it's
    falling forward, you might want to thin the top curve a bit.\r\n\r\nAll in all,
    this is a very nice typeface. Are there plans to do an italicized version or bolder
    weights? "

    body: "thank you! \r\nyeah, the plan is to make it complete with italics and at
      least one bolder weight. well, i made first sketches of this in august 2006,
      so the complete opentype thing will be ready in 2028, i guess :) i didn't even
      take closer look on the italics so far. but now i see it's worth to keep it
      up.\r\nthanks."

    sizes it isn't really a problem, but in text sizes the 'a' gets less legible."

  body: "I like it very much, too. I'm pretty much in agreement with Asvetic on the
    <em>a</em> and <em>s</em>. I wonder if <em>h</em>, <em>m</em>, and <em>n</em>
    would be improved by flattening the curve a little? Maybe if they didn't taper
    quite so much toward the stem? Or if the taper were more \"chiseled\"? But having
    said that, I am fine with the <em>h</em>, <em>m</em>, and <em>n</em>. The only
    thing that bothers me is the <em>a</em>'s small aperture.\r\n\r\nCan't wait to
    see what you do with the bold, italic, and ligatures.\r\n\r\nVery nice! I really
    like it."

  body: "Yeah, I saw that one, but personally I'm not very much in to monospaced faces.
    :)\r\nBut I love Kompilat a lot. Eventhough I still think the bowl of the 'a'
    is a bit too small, especially for textsizes. But apart from that, I like the
    quirkyness it has, the calligraphic 'indents' in the lines and such. Keep it up."

    could get a bit bigger, but not much. Also, consider adding a touch more weight
    to the head serifs (top left of i,n,m and top of d,b etc.\r\n\r\nReminds me of
    the toothiness of FF Eureka, my favorite type by Peter Bil'ak.\r\n\r\nRandy"
