  Cruise</a> folks were using on their site . The E is shaped like a C with a line
  in the middle, the 'a' is single-storey, the U has a stem, and the 'y' has a u-shaped
  bowl. It doesn't show up in the Sans Serif ID Guide, even though its attributes
  are distinctive, and there were enough letters to assign the full set of style codes.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  recognize this font? Thanks for any help."
