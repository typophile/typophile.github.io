  interested in purchasing a new font (most likely a didone) but it is obviously not
  on my bill if I do.\r\n\r\nSo I've run into a problem. I know that very often designers
  recommend fonts and I've often wondered how do they sell it to the clients or <cite>themselves</cite>
  if they can't see it in front of them. I realize some of you may not need to see
  it to know if it will work, but I am extremely visual\u2014I need to see it in front
  of me. \r\n\r\nI know that there's a testdrive on most typographer's websites, but
  I'm running into issues where I want to do different typefaces or different weights.
  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n(I know that I can screenshot, but that's incredibly inefficient.)"

    it depends on the screen shot. But no matter what it looks like it is better than
    nothing.\r\n\r\nA tight sketch can be a beautiful thing!"
