  body: "Hmmm. I have just read that section of Tam's thesis, and while he's a smart
    fellow, a good typographer and a nice guy, I am not yet convinced that the humanist
    sans typefaces of the 90s are all that different than those of the 80s. Their
    positioning in an extended family is more common, but not entirely new (e.g. Stone
    Sans / Serif, Legacy Sans / Serif). There aren't any specific design traits he
    calls out that distinguish these from their predecessors. Availability of oldstyle
    figures, maybe? But these are not such a fundamental characteristic of a typeface,
    in my mind, unless they are made the default figures.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    to the difference between the humanist sans of the 80s and 90s and the specific
    design traits that he mentions. He raises some interesting issues and if one (or
    even better, a typographic scholar) includes all and all humanist typefaces designed
    up to the present day and then analyzes them his conclusions would be more acceptable
    than Tam\u2019s. \r\n\r\nJust put Johnston\u2019s London Underground Sans side
    by side with Frutiger Next, the former does give the impression of being quite
    aged, a classic nevertheless\u2026 while on the other hand Frutiger Next emanates
    postmodern aesthetics.\r\n\r\nAnd here comes an interesting question, which was
    the very first Humanist Sans? Doric Bold, aka Humanist 970 (1870) or Johnston\u2019s
    London Underground Sans (1916)? \r\n"

  body: I think [[http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=143&fid=613|Martin Majoor's
    ideology]] has shaped many contemporary ideas on how a sans serif design is created.
    Scala Sans was a literal derivation of the Bembo-like Scala Serif. So contemporary
    sans=humanist/Venetian type muddied into grotesques, without any pursuit of an
    essential form.

  body: Yeah, but Syntax was designed in the 1960s, and Syntax was sort of designed
    as a sans serif Sabon. While Scala Sans really fits to Scala, since they have
    a similar skeleton & weight, etc., the idea of of looking back on the proportions
    of a Garalde for the design of a new sans serif isn't neo-anything. Syntax pre-dates
    Frutiger, so it is definitely before the enormous crest of humanist sans serifs
    came along.

  body: "My point was two-fold:\r\n\r\n- In the 90s there were still grotesques, neo-grotesques,
    geometric sans and even humanist sans being designed and released that did not
    fit any obvious \"neo-humanist\" mold. What it is fair to say, and may be all
    that Tam was trying to say, is that some particular style of humanist sans became
    much more popular. However, one would need to define the characteristics of that
    style.\r\n\r\n- I would be very interested in how one defines the characteristics
    of this \"neo-humanist\" style, as to whether said characteristics are particularly
    \"new\" in the 90s or have antecedents in the 80s and earlier. I'm expecting the
    latter, but it depends on the definition.\r\n\r\nFor my part, as long as we have
    somebody calling themselves \"Hypatia\" in the thread, I'll note that the past
    decade or so saw a resurgence of geometric sans, which was largely a revival,
    stylistically: Avenir came back into vogue, and new typefaces like Gotham and
    Neutraface were innovative and well-executed, yet also in the style of previous
    work. (My* own Hypatia Sans was intended to be part of that geometric sans resurgence.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n*
    I'll continue to call it \"my\" typeface as a shorthand, and because the main
    ideas and all the outlines of the upright were my doing, but I owe a huge debt
    to Robert Slimbach for constant input and guidance, Miguel Sousa and Robert for
    doing the kerning on the upright faces, and now Paul Hunt for finishing the italics."

    succeed the Grotesques and Humanist Sans in the future?\"\r\n\r\nAs no one actually
    gave his views about this particular topic, I thought a bit about it and this
    is what I came up with:\r\n\r\n1.\tWe could have a new type of  Sans Serifs based
    directly on 'almost upright' handwriting and enhanced structurally according to
    the principles of Graphology.\r\n2.\tWe could alternatively have Sans Serifs based
    on curvatures and other structural details found in industrial objects, such as
    cars and even architectural buildings.\r\n3.\tThe Geometric Sans on the other
    had might evolve from experimental typefaces and ideas such as those presented
    in Letter Spirit:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/farg/mcgrawg/lspirit.html\r\n\r\n4.\tNew

    A better way of looking at this is by seeing how the neo-grotesques/neo-humanists
    address the problems that exist in typographic settings.\r\n\r\nI still think
    that Scala Serif/Sans as well as other early [[http://typophile.com/node/29924?|super
    families]] are the most notable contemporary examples of how the sans serif can
    be used in a complete typographic system. They address the problem of the lack
    of harmony that exists in a setting where non-linear reading occurs (as mentioned
    by [[http://www.keithtam.net/documents/sanserif.pdf|Tam]] p.12), without being
    overly ambitious in creating a sans serif that aims to bear the full burden of
