body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Writing Systems]] : [[Arabic]] : Nastaliq, scholarly
  transcribed as <cite>nasta\u02BFl\xEEq</cite></strong>\r\n\r\nThe name is a contraction
  of the Persian <cite>naskh-i ta\u02BFl\xEEq</cite> which contains the element <cite>naskh</cite>
  \"to copy a manuscript\" and <cite>ta\u02BFl\xEEq</cite> \"to slant\", connected
  by the conjunction <cite>-i</cite>. The name could be paraphrased as \"cursive for
  manuscripts\".\r\n\r\nNastaliq is a simplified derivative of historical, pre-typographic
  naskh. It retains all the connection rules characteristic of pre-typographic Arabic,
  be it that they are considerably less complex than those of pre-typographic naskh.\r\n\r\nFrom
  a purely Western typographical perspective, nastaliq is considered to be \"very
  complex\". Ironically and apparently paradoxically, the first accurate metal typeface
  produced in the Arabic-scripted world - using Western typographic technology - was
  based on nastaliq.  \r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/34937\">Handwritten
