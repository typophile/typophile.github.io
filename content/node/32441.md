  body: This is indeed Font Bureau's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FB.605.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=BOAT+SHOW&sampleSize=48">Eagle</a>.
    Schwab, on the other hand, doesn't use Eagle. He uses a <a href="http://typophile.com/node/21343">typeface
    derived from his own lettering</a>.

  body: Not that I am aware. Why not contact him and ask? I suspect it's proprietary,
    but would love to hear his response.

  body: "I went to purchase the Eagle Family and noticed there was only a Postscript
    version for the Mac. I am working on a Mac OSX 10.4.9 and using Suitcase Fusion
    12.1.3\r\n\r\nI have been told that OSX supports True Type, but I would like a
    bit of feedback from those of you who do this sort of thing on a daily basis.
    Should I get the Windows TT or the Mac Postscript?\r\n\r\n "
