body: "I just got an iMac and wondered, why all the Indian-name typefaces? I assume
  they include Indian character glyphs, but why so many? Why are they seemingly the
  same? For example, the following look (nearly) identical (and these probably aren't
  even comprehensive because I stopped at \"M\"):\r\n\r\nSet 1: \r\n\r\nMalayalam\r\nBangla\r\nLao\r\nGurmukhi\r\nKannada\r\nMyanmar\r\n\r\nSet
  2:\r\n\r\nBangala Sangram\r\nDevanagari MT\r\nGjuarati Sangram\r\nInai Mathi\r\nLao
  Sangram\r\nMyanmar Sangram\r\nMalayalam Sangram\r\n\r\nJust curious. "

  body: When you say 'they look the same', are you looking at the Indian characters,
    or at Latin characters that show up in the font preview or font menu listings?
    The latter might be substituted from other fonts.

    Sangam MN.ttf\r\nDevanagari Sangam MN.ttc\r\nGujarati Sangam MN.ttf\r\nKannada
    Sangam MN.ttf\r\nMalayalam Sangam MN.ttf\r\nOriya Sangam MN.ttf\r\nSinhala Sangam
    MN.ttf\r\nTamil Sangam MN.ttf\r\nTelugu Sangam MN.ttf\r\n\r\nKhmer Sangam MN.ttf\r\nLao
    Sangam MN.ttf\r\nMyanmar Sangam MN.ttf\r\n</PRE>\r\nThe last three correspond
    to Southeast Asian Scripts, the first group to South Asian Scripts, as you can
    see on the <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/charts/\">Unicode Character Code Charts</a>.\r\n\r\nBangla
    corresponds to Bengali. Inai Mathi is Tamil if I rely on the unicode range it
    covers."

  body: John, I am only looking at the Font Preview.  But unless you need Indian characters,
    there's really no reason to keep these activated (or keep them in general), correct?
