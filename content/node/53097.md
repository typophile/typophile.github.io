  thing, and therefore go through the annual ritual of transferring important dates
  into the new year right about now, I thought it might be useful to accumulate some
  of the important typo-event dates worth saving for this year.\r\n\r\nI'll start
  with <strong>TypeCon2009: 14&#150;19 July, 2009,</strong> in Atlanta this year.
  <em>\r\n(Those dates include the Tue & Wed pre-conference workshops, in addition
  to the conference proper -- Thursday through Sunday.)</em>\r\n\r\nThere's another
  thread started already about <strong>TypoBerlin: 21&#150;23 May, 2009.</strong>\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know when ATypI Mexico City is going to be? Couldn't find any information
  on the ATypI website."

    in mind for the ATypI Mexico City trip will be the 3-week mol\xE9 festival in
    San Pedro Atocpan, in the very southern reaches of Mexico City. Last year's was
    4-26 October; I can't find dates for the 2009 event yet.\r\n\r\nThis site is in
    Spanish (I've not found a lot of info about this festival in English):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.feriadelmole.com/index.htm\r\n\r\nNor
    have I attended this. But I have tasted mol\xE9s from this area, and they have
    been excellent. \r\n\r\nI guess I better plan on a month in Mexico City: mol\xE9
    festival, ATypI, then day of the Dead.\r\n\r\nHasta luego.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Another thought, more serious this time:\r\n\r\nOrganizers of events may
    want to think about advance polling of people to see how many think they may be
    able to attend. As budgets shrink, fewer folks may be able to travel. \r\n\r\nOrganizers
    of a conference I attend every year have called it off entirely because so few
    university press production and design staff members have sufficient loot in their
    budgets to attend this year. Anticipated low attendance meant not enough money
    coming in as fees; the organizing press felt it was impossible to stage the conference.
    University presses are cutting back on travel budgets these days. I do not expect
    that our annual general meeting will be cancelled, but I expect attendance will
    be down.\r\n\r\nInstitutional, corporate, and individual travel budgets are among
    the first to feel the knife when money is tight. I hope to go to Mexico City;
    ten months out I am not at all sure I'll be able to afford it. I hope enough others
    feel differently, and I hope the organizers can put on a vibrant event.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Will -- I don't know about \"polling,\" but an anticipated drop in attendance
    is certainly something that the SoTA board has discussed regarding TypeCon. I
    don't think we would ever consider canceling TypeCon, since it remains the primary
    <em>raison d'\xEAtre</em> for SoTA. But we've already decided not to raise our
    fees at all, keeping them the same as last year, in a small effort to keep the
    gathering as affordable as we can. Of course, travel and accommodations are always
    the big-ticket items.\r\n\r\nSorry to hear that the AAUP Production meeting was
    cancelled.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Such a poll would not be that hard to do, at the start. It would, I admit,
    be far from definitive. E-mail address lists exist for organization members and
    for people who have attended conferences in the past. Sending out an e-mail to
    the list, asking a few questions about attendance would be done easily. Toting
    up replies and making sense of them will be more work, though. On top of the already
    tough task of setting up a conference.\r\n\r\nThe group I referred to that cancelled
    its meeting is a fairly tight-knit group of around a hundred folks, I'd guess.
    So that's easier. It took one e-mail from the organizer, a batch of responses,
    and in a couple of weeks the decision was made.\r\n\r\nBest of luck for TypeCon,
    TypoBerlin, and ATypI. Best of luck for everything in 2009. We need it.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "One additional note, the typography conferences help in far-flung exotic
    locations seem to attract a good number of locals, as well as the usual suspects
    (more often than not the speakers). If the goal of the organizers is typographic
    education/evangelism then they don't need all of us to attend - but it does make
    for more fun and better parties.  \r\n\r\nAnother note - these events could not
    be run without corporate sponsorship, subsidized/free local venues, volunteers
    and in some cases government funding. So the best thing anyone with any influence
    could do to support them is get their sponsorship $'s and tangible offers of help
    in early.  \r\n\r\n"

    plan was to return the site to a neutral design temporarily. But now the 2009
    Atlanta identity is underway (by Armin Vit and Bryony Gomez-Palacio), and timing
    might be such that it makes sense to wait until the identity is done and do the
    whole update at once. Tamye's still working on speakers, etc. It's still a little
