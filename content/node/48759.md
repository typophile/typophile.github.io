  body: Last year I used Bickham Script Pro for a wedding invitation. The font above
    doesn't look like Bickham, but appears to have a large variety of swash characters
    just the same. I purchased from myfonts.com

  body: This is definitely handwritten. I know you asked for fonts, but if you're
    interested, it's the work of calligrapher [[http://www.lhcalligraphy.com/invitations/lucky_orchid_set_14.htm|Laura
    Hooper]].
