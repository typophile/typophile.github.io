  body: "Wow... I've used Univers many times, but never with the ampersand. Mine actually
    is the typeface from Adobe, so I don't have the same ampersand, but at least I
    know what font to use.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!"

  body: That's why I posted the picture -- only some versions of Univers have the
    "Et" ampersand. A little bit of cultural history in a single glyph!
