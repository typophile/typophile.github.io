  body: That is one strange unicase typeface. Any info on the source (print or web)
    year/country of origin--and perhaps a larger sample?

  body: "Looks like a ransom note where letters from fonts of different widths but
    the same caps height, and a lowercase _e_ expanded to the caps height, were carefully
    lined up to make words. Note that some letters such as _A_, _M_ and _R_ come in
    both wide and narrow widths. \r\nPossibly the capitals are from the same font
    and were severely compressed in some cases but not in others.\r\nDon"

  body: "Ryuk, good call for a similar _G_ from Carlton. It also has a similar top
    overhanging _A_ as an alt. Letraset got its design -- according a predigtal Letraset
    catalog -- from Stephenson Blake. The original is Ehmcke Antiqua by Fritz Helmut
    Ehmcke 1908.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks Frode! That's it! I instantly thought about Gareth Hague from Alias
    Type mainly remembering [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alias/ano|Ano]]. Checked
    Alias website but apparently not correctly... Ano Serif it is!
