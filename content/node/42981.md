body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was designing a font and out of nowhere I get hit with a error
  messages stating\"> [FATAL]  GPOS feature \\'kern\\' causes overflow of offset to
  a subtable (0x1009c)\r\n> ERROR: There was a problem while compiling OpenType font.
  Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition for errors\r\n\r\nWhenever
  I introduce new kerning to a glyph I kept getting this error when generating opentype
  ps. I contacted Fontlab and Adam Twardoch has gone beyond the call of duty trying
  to help me. Thanks Adam!! He mentioned downloading the Adobe FDK for OpenType. There
  is apparently a kern program that might fix the problem I am having. My question
  is can someone please explain how to install the program. Do I need to install Python?
  Also do I install the fdk program into the directory where Fontlab is installed?\r\n\r\nBoy,
  any help would be greatly appreciated. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Charles Borges

  body: They should be in the Macro toolbar. Choose Kerning from the first pop-up
    and the Kern Feature Generator will appear in the second pop-up. Click the Run
    arrow button to run it (though it may require some set up in the font--click on
    the Edit Script button to see info about it in the script's comments).

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can help me on this. I am trying to install
    the FDk but I can't seem to figure this. I have python installed and I keep getting
    the error listing here:\r\nOn step 7, if you have Python installed but still get
    a message that says \u2019'python' is not recognized as an internal or external
    command, operable program or batch file.\u2019, locate the folder where Python
    is installed, and add that folder\u2019s path to the \u2019PATH\u2019 User Variable.\r\n\r\nI
    can't seem to figure that out. The computer I am using is an IMac with Vista running.
    My Fontlab is a pc version. Any help would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"
