    What planet are you from, Peter? I hope you weren't expecting it to come for free
    with a box of cereals. (All in good humour ;-) ) I mean, I checked the price twice
    after reading your comment -- I think this family is very reasonably priced.\r\n\r\nKidding
    aside, what would you consider a fair price for HTF Requiem?"

    fonts that you'll be able to use over and over again. Their typefaces are worth
    every penny."

    other foundries can charge as much $60 or so for a single weight (like that godawful
    Bookman swash at Castcraft). \r\n\r\nOr my unrequited crush, FBNobel which will
    set you back over $500 for the family.\r\n\r\nThat said, you can buy Nobel in
    single weights, which HTF doesn't seem to offer."
