  trying to work out a symbol or font that looks like this :\r\n\r\n)-( \r\n\r\nBut
  the dash in-between joins both brackets making it look like an H or sort of an X.
  I have no idea if it is a type of letter or represents something else? \r\n\r\nIf
  I can put an age to when it was used I would say it was used around 1680-1720. And
  it was used on its own and not in a sentence.\r\n\r\nHas anybody seen something
  like this at all? Basically if I can find out what this is I think I can narrow
  down the date further.\r\n\r\nThanks. "

    so, you can find a corresponding character U+2653, &#9811;, in the unicode charts
    http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf, that looks like this\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pisces_5798.png]\r\nHere
    is how the character looks like in the font Brill\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pisces-brill_6388.png]"

  body: "Hi Michel,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your reply to my post and I think you are
    correct, it must be the Zodiac sign for Pisces, I cannot see it really being anything
    else.\r\n\r\nI am very grateful for your answer.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJon"
