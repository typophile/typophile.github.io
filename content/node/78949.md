    new one (which they've stopped using) by New York agency Laird & Partners.

    or something like that?"

  body: "Yes, they scrapped the new logo, made another mistake by trying to crowdsource
    a replacement logo, and eventually just reverted back to their old logo. \r\n\r\nThere
    was a discussion on Typophile about it (http://www.typophile.com/node/74956),
    and if you Google you'll find articles about it at several sites. "

  body: Wow, I had never seen that before. I'm surprised that even got past the concept
    stage. It looks like the designer just set the word "Gap" in Helvetica, made a
    few tweaks added a square and said, "Nailed it!"
