  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a typeface that suggests &lsquo;now&rsquo; in typography, for use in an essay/design project which partially covers the same. The typeface in question will be used only for headlines, so it can be (but doesn&rsquo;t have to be) fairly chaotic or even somewhat illegible. It should be something that appeals to a design aesthetic, rather than strict functionality&hellip; something like the 2007 equivalent of Dead History or the like. This project is still in the semi-conceptual phase, so a wide range of stuff would be good. Cheers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>jpad,
Mostly I tend to agree, especially if we are talking about Type with a capital T, but with this project I am attempting to look into how type interfaces with society on the level of everyday life, and Dupré&rsquo;s work just isn&rsquo;t communicating that to me, if that makes any sense. To me, &ldquo;legible, rational, and gorgeous&rdquo; is more about how designers perceive design and not how it is experienced in the real world. Of course, what a typeface represents also depends on how it is used, so something pristine and beautiful may be still be suitable; I&rsquo;m just not sure yet.</p>
<p>I apologize for being so deliberately vague, but I think this is one of those &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m after when I see it&rdquo; situations. Further suggestions would be very welcome.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks people. Gotham was actually one of my first thoughts, especially as it is so ubiquitous today. I am considering some of the Sudtipos fonts as well, although not the scripts as I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re well suited for the layouts I have in mind. The search continues, but you&rsquo;ve given me some good direction.</div>

<p>Nice! Definitely under consideration.</p>
<p>Stephen,</p>
<p>Sure. The project will be a series of 6ʺ×9ʺ pages, composed as spreads (probably about 20–25 pages in total). The left side of each spread will be composed of illustrations, typographic compositions, and photographs, sometimes with captions relating them to the main text. Each of these pages will also have a one-word identifier which ties it into the text in some way. This is the largest typographic element, at about 24pt, and is where the typeface in question will likely be used. Right now I&rsquo;m using Franklin Gothic Condensed for the captions- which can change, however the way the captions and layouts are set up, they tend to have a significant vertical emphasis, so I think it might be good to have the larger type contrast with that by being wide or rounded.</p>
<p>The right-hand side of each spread will contain the actual text, and is set up in a very old-school way, with classical proportions. Right now this is set with Sabon, which I feel pretty comfortable with. The text itself deals with a number of issues. Some concepts which I feel are relevant to type selection are the idea that we simultaneously parse a number of typographic styles at any given point in time (and are getting much more adept at doing so), and the idea that type reflects culture and can do so either on an honest, historical level or in a contrived, imagined-by-the-designer kind of way, and that these two are not always mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>As is probably obvious by now, this is a student project, and my budget is fairly limited, so it would be nice to license something which has the side benefit of being useful in the future. The selection of fonts available at the school is fairly good, but they don&rsquo;t have anything truly contemporary.</p>
