    Art Deco based in my searching I saw some similar with the flair on the A/R/ along
    with the shallow M.  But none quite as squared off.\r\n\r\nAll that lower arc
    distortion is done via text warp in either Ps or Illy or whateva... \r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "You could try your distortions on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/zingende/\">Zingende</a>
    by Ray Larabie. Closer than Anna. Lots of letters follow the R model. You could
    adapt an O to the A. Not quite as cornered as your sample but it might do as a
    rough match. Or you could do some blending with Compacta.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "OldNick ...I swear you've got too much going on!!!\r\n\r\nThat font is one
    of yours ...I thought it was ...smelt retro.\r\n\r\nGreasy Spoon NF \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontspace.com/nicks-fonts/greasy-spoon-nf\r\n\r\nAnd
    for what it's worth I was wrong about the effect. Once I got the font into Illy
    it was plain to see that that effect can be achieved via a mesh ...after it was
    mangled in Illy it was stroked in Ps and then hit with a grunge effect.\r\n\r\nNo
    wonder you didn't recognize one of your own ...LOL!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
