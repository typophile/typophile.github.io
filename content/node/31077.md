  the cover of the book <em>Design Connoisseur</em>. Specifically, the font that the
  title and the authors' names are set in.\r\n\r\nAlso, in case the font in question
  does not have lowercase characters, any suggestions for one that does? I'm very
  fond of the subtle ornament and curve in the font, as well as the understated serifs.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignConnoisseur_6431.jpg]"

  body: Louise Fili has a very large collection of type specimens and other ephemeral
    items from which she draws much of her inspiration. This is probably something
    which someone can ID, but I'd be impressed further if it were available digitally.

  body: You can always count on Nick to digitize these delicious old typefaces that
    otherwise would be endangered by extinction. Good show, and impressive indeed.
