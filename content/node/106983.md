  over five years I\u2019ve photographed lettering, signs and tags, and published
  them on my blog \u2018Mads knipser\u2019. Now I\u2019ve designed a book with a lot
  of the best. Over 100 pages of typographical snapshots, mostly from Copenhagen,
  but also Amsterdam, Berlin, Cairo, Dubai, M\xE1laga, New York, Paris and Lisbon.
  Over 160 photographs showing many of the diverse expressions & designs the written
  word can contain. I wish to publish my book \u2013 and to succeed, I need to sell
  184 copies.\r\n\r\nThe book is 30 x 30 cm, 104 pages.\r\nPrinted on 150 g Garda
  Matt.\r\n1,5 kg.\r\n\r\nMore pictures of it on my my website: www.madshougaard.dk/mads-knipser-the-book/.
  \r\nFeel free to contact me if you have questions.\r\n\r\nNotice: If you order the
  book, and I don\u2019t reach my goal, you don\u2019t get the book. But you don\u2019t
  pay anything either.\r\n\r\nPreorder here:\r\nhttp://j.mp/16tDjdU"
