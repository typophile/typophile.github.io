  body: "Did not find an exact match to all letters in a single font.\r\nCould perhaps
    be a customization of Erbar Grotesk URW Demi Bold, a revival of a design by Jakob
    Erbar originally published by Ludwig & Mayer in 1926. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErbarGroteskURWDemiBoldAsPORTABLE_5296.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErbarGroteskURWDemiBoldAsBUILDING_4737.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/erbar/\r\nFonts
    like Futura, Architype Renner, Twentieth Century, Neuzeit Grotesk, FF Mark, Semplicita,
    Century Gothic, etc. also have similarities.\r\nDon"

  body: "Can't find a match but far from meaning it's not a font. It looks to share
    earmarks of different geometric sans like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]] (/P, /O and /R) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]] (pointy
    angles, /A, /N) with an '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22Art+Deco%22|art
    deco]] twist (low/high crossbar position, unbalanced counters, /A, /B) close to
    some [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface]] but strangely on
    some letters only (/R, /E not impacted). Kerning looks also terrible, mainly the
    /TA part which could be the indicator of a freebie, a hand-lettering, an amateurish
    work or a mash-up. The closest I have at the moment is Billy Argel's [[http://www.dafont.com/nova2.font|Nova]]
    which, part of /B, looks pretty close, including the awfully-kerned /TA pair.\r\nIt'd
    probably be helpful to share more on your sample if you're seeking a positive
    answer like the origin, creation date, brand...\r\nAlternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/emblema-headline|Emblema]],

  body: "I agree Ryuk that this could be \"a freebie, a hand-lettering, an amateurish
    work or a mash-up.\" Useful list with links.\r\nLooking at _G_ with its high serif
    and retracted top terminal, I find Relish Bold -- suggested by Fivos -- might
    be closest. If I had to choose a font for tinkering this would be at or near the
    top. The only major editing is _B_. Flip the _P_ for the bottom of _B_. Perhaps
    extract arcs from the top of _8_ for the top of _B. Or simply extract the _B_
    from Moderna -- also suggested by Fivos --  resize to match Relish Bold, and insert
    it in the font. Might have to adjust stroke weight.\r\nDon"
