  body: Not Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa has a very distinctive "H" which is nothing like
    this one. Not Bernhard either; the overall look and feel is similar, but the characters
    are quite different.

  body: AT FIVES POINTS looks more like Anziano small caps. I'm sure I've seen the
    other one, but don't know it off hand.
