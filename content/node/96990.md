  body: "I ran the compareFamily to a bunch of bought fonts as well and got similar
    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi

  body: The second glyph of any pair will be colored if it is a dependent member of
    a kerning class (to remind you that if you're going to alter the kerning, you
    should use the master glyph, unless you want to create an exception). To eliminate
    the distraction you can change it in Options, Metrics window colors.

  body: "As cerulean said, in Metrics windows colors* you can change the color from
    purple to any color you wish, including black. By doing this the dependent letters
    don\u2019t change their status, only the color in which they are shown.\r\n\r\n*
    I am on a Mac, so the path is: Fontlab Studio menu > Preferences > Metric windows
    > Metric Window colors > Dependant pairs."
