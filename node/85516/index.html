  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi there, I&rsquo;m a new member to these forums as it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve needed to elicit the help of you guys, previously I was content to just peruse through the archives and find information there. So currently, I&rsquo;m researching for my third year dissertation, and surprise surprise, it&rsquo;s on typography.</p>
<p>One of my case studies is based around typography acting as an identity for a city/region. There is already quite a bit that I&rsquo;ve managed to gather on it, for example Metro Letters: a typeface for the twin cities - but all this is fairly recent. One of my themes of investigation is how type and cultural identity have changed over time. So my questions really are&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it a recent phenomenon that cities feel like they have to have an almost corporate brand feel?
If so/if not, then when did it begin?</p>
<p>N.B. I say &ldquo;history&rdquo;, but even going back as far as the 20th century is enough to compare.</p>
<p>Thanks very much in advance if anyone has any nuggets of information to part!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The concept of &ldquo;branding&rdquo; <em>per se</em> is a fairly recent phenomenon, although &ldquo;trademarks&rdquo; have been around since at least 1777, when the Bass Brewery registered Great Britain&rsquo;s first ®, and longer than that in the form of the &ldquo;hallmarks&rdquo; used by craftsmen from medieval times.</p>
<p>City—or, perhaps more properly, Empire—&ldquo;branding&rdquo; is much older: in witness whereof, consider the iconic statue of Romulus and Remus and the SPQR banners carried by Roman legionaries.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks oldnick for the pointers, I didn&rsquo;t think of looking at it from the &ldquo;empire&rdquo; point of view, it definitely sounds interesting, but may be straying a bit too much from my topics of discussion. So it&rsquo;s something to look in to at some other point I hope! Also I&rsquo;ve since discovered it is claimed that Peter Behrens was the father/founder of corporate identity in 1907 for AEG.</p>
<p>JamesM: There is quite a nice book which exhibits the whole process of the project. It&rsquo;s called Metro Letters: A typeface for the twin Cities. Basically back in 2003, in conjunction with the Twin Cities Design Celebration (TCDC), a type project was started inviting a handful of well established type designers/studios to create a unique face for the Twin Cities. The winning entry was by LettError, and I must admit it is a beaut, so do check it out. To this day, I don&rsquo;t think it has been implemented which is a shame, but there is mention in the book that it was mainly to brand any publications/literature derived for the TCDC and to get people interested in type and design, more so than to brand the two cities. Kind of like the stuff Erik Spiekermann did for Glasgow quite a few years ago, I guess.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the additional info on Metro Letters.</p>
<p>Offhand I&rsquo;d think that cities have far less ability to brand themselves than private companies do. Branding a city&rsquo;s official website and literature is certainly feasible, although in many cities (especially smaller ones) some of the city&rsquo;s publications are put together by departmental staffers who clearly aren&rsquo;t designers and who may not understand or care about typographic guidelines.</p>
<p>Regarding signage, city council members may be hesitant to vote the money to redo all the city&rsquo;s signage just to update the typography. And some signage may be impractical to change or may need to be retained for historic reasons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying branding doesn&rsquo;t happen, obviously some cities do try to brand themselves. I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s more difficult, for a variety of reasons, than for a corporation to do so.</p>

<p>As my question states I was more interested in finding out the how far back city&rsquo;s started this &ldquo;effort&rdquo;, but through my research it does seem like something recently adapted in the past two decades maximum. However there has always been an intricate non-corportate relationship with city and typography obviously which is still very interesting.</p>

There was no follow-up online which I found to suggest this.</p>
<p>Interestingly Yanone&rsquo;s work for Amman, the capital of Jordan, although starting off in a sense as a university project, actually manifested into a typeface officially used by the city which is great news and with good coverage of the project as well.</p>

I am a geography student here in Utah (Western U.S., Rockies, Great Salt Lake, etc.) and completed a paper awhile ago on my town&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sense of Place&rdquo;. In reference to that I would like you Google &ldquo;Welcome Arches&rdquo;, the Western U.S. is dotted with them. Most famous might be Reno, Nevada. My hometown (Brigham City, Utah) has quite a good looking one as well which has been there since the mid 1920&rsquo;s. Also something that might help&hellip;Google or Wikipedia &ldquo;Hillside Letters&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mountain Monograms&rdquo; these are letters that represent High Schools and Colleges.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah right, yes now you&rsquo;ve brought it to my attention, I do remember that Las Vegas sign featured in films and whatnot, it didn&rsquo;t cross my mind to think of that when looking at welcome &ldquo;arches&rdquo;, but I agree it pretty much does the same job.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there some celebrity uproar when there were talks of disposing of the sign? I remember reading that actors were paying ridiculous amounts trying to save it. Anyway, it&rsquo;s interesting that you bring it up actually, obviously the Hollywood sign is one of its kind and instantly recognisable, but I wonder whether it&rsquo;s the whole backdrop and context as well that contribute to that. For example, if you were to replace the lettering, particular the &ldquo;O&quot;s with a rounder form for instance, do you think people would notice?</p>
<p>Questions like this are surfacing in my mind since I&rsquo;m also looking at the London Underground and Johnston&rsquo;s infamous typeface, and I found out a while ago that one of the roundels at Euston Square (just an underground station for people unfamiliar with the tube) actually have the wrong typeface, I believe they used Gill Sans instead of Johnston&rsquo;s, yet I don&rsquo;t think people bat an eyelid when they look at it. May have something to do with the two faces being quite similar, or also just because it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, I don&rsquo;t know what parameters you have, but the idea of associating visual symbols to places can be quite far reaching. Have you considered the concept of landmarks in relationship to communicating place. Using made up symbols to communicate might be a nice  venture, consider the hobos who placed notches on fence posts to communicate a friendly home. [[http://www.vagabondish.com/the-secret-language-of-vagabonds-and-traveling-hobos/]] The prominence of structures also can create significance thus creating a sense of language without the use of the alphabet. I apologize if I keep finding examples from my region but not only was Independence Rock in Wyoming a landmark of significance to the pioneers, but they carved and tarred their names in it! I have been there and it is quite a sight! This might be a little in left field (I tend to be a divergent thinker) How about &ldquo;Metes and Bounds&rdquo; which communicates property lines using natural features. All I&rsquo;m saying is don&rsquo;t limit yourself to the alphabet, visual communication is everywhere! If I saw a picture of Big Ben I wouldn&rsquo;t think, A big clock. I would think, Big Ben=London. You can&rsquo;t force that type of communication. Typography is interesting because it&rsquo;s one of the few arts that tries NOT to be noticed&hellip;well, generally. Question? Do you have an actual hypothesis in mind for this dissertation, or is this an exploration. (I should have started with that question to begin with.) Thanks for your consideration.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, TurtleType, I love diverse thinking myself as usually better ideas follow but I&rsquo;m afraid my time is limited in this venture and I just need to press on with what I already have and not diverge too much. Obviously there is communication on all levels and it&rsquo;s not limited to type and letterforms, but that is my main area of interest and if I branch out too much I might as well be looking at visual communication as a whole. Also just to establish that it&rsquo;s an explorative study I&rsquo;m doing rather than proposing a hypothesise and then looking for findings etc. Basically I am focused on the relationship between typography and culture, and investigating this on three levels: national, local/regional and in metro systems with time as a parameter, so my research spans from the last century. This was actually through the suggestion of my supporting tutor, however I&rsquo;ve come to regret it as with such a wide scope it doesn&rsquo;t seem feasible to get really in-depth. I would have definitely done it differently had I not already gone this far.</div>

<p>There would be a very negative reaction if someone changed the sign. It&rsquo;s a landmark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not famous due to the appropriateness of the font. A skilled designer would not have picked that font to represent Hollywood. It&rsquo;s more like folk art. And it&rsquo;s been there so long that it&rsquo;s become iconic.</p>
