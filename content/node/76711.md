  body: There are lots of similar styles from Solotype, such as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/mural/|Mural]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/sentry/|Sentry]]. Click on the blue
    Solotype link on either for the full list. Also some similar styles from [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Coffee_Bin_Fonts/|Coffee
    Bin]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Spiece_Graphics/|Spiece Graphics]].
    Most are a little more ornate, and the crossbar of A is tilted in the opposite
    direction if it is slanted..
