  body: I need to re-create the logo exactly as is in vector format. All the Co. has
    is the .jpg.... I could recreate from scratch, but it sure would save some time
    with at least a couple of the fonts...

    all the lettering. I just looked for the Script in my Guide and didn't see it,
    so i hope someone else here has some ideas for these fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
