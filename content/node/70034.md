body: "Hello. \r\nMy book is a technical manual for an art technique that has 4 large
  chapters and each chapter has several sections and some of the sections have subsections
  within them. Instead of the traditional table of contents I would like to make an
  index page with maybe a sentence-long summaries of each chapter or/and section...
  What are some other ways to make the traditional TOC a better, more useful experience
  for the reader?"

  body: "FWIW, an experiment I made once (in my final thesis for design school) was
    to have the TOC in the form of a vertical ruler of sorts, showing main chapters
    and subsections, on fold-out flaps in the front and back:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bruecken_3947.jpg]\r\nEach
    line in the \xABruler\xBB corresponds to one spread; the vertical position of
    the page numbers on the pages would correlate with this. Since this was printed
    digitally it all wasn't as precise as I'd have liked it, but I still found it
    interesting as a way to map out one's position in the text relative to the chapter
    structure; and it was interesting to be able to make visual cross-references,
    using arrows pointing to the referenced spread in the TOC (as can be seen in the
    photo).\r\nBTW, the text dealt at least in part with linearity, nonlinearity,
    and cross-linking techniques, so this \xABnavigation\xBB was sort of a meta-statement
    in itself."
