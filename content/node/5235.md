  body: Thanks. But it is not this. Commando is broken in the middle, and this isn&#39;t.
    Do you know any similar fonts to Commando?  <BR>Regards,  <BR>Maria

  body: Maria, you didn&#39;t have to start a new thread for the same ID request.
    <BR>Do you only need the &#39;e&#39;? Take Helvetica Condensed and customize it.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/cargo/"> Cargo</a> is similar
    in concept, but it&#39;s not so narrow/condensed.

  body: I don&#39;t believe this is a font, Maria. <BR>It&#39;s simply the letter
    &#39;e&#39; from Helvetica Condensed, modified to look like a stencil.
