  files from it to my powerbook G4, the phone has infrared wireless capabilities but
  laptop does not. Ive been looking around for an infrared adaptor for my laptop but
  cant find any for the mac. I do already haver a infrared mouse, is there any program
  I can download so I can use the mouses' usb adaptor to work with the phone? Im guessing
  no and if so could anyone point me in the direction of where I could buy an infrared
  adaptor. \r\n\r\nThanks alot,\r\n\r\nDavid."

    to connect both or an adaptor so my laptop has infrared capabilities, though I
    cant find either.

  body: "I have come across this if anyone is interested, a usb Irda adaptor that
    they say works with Mac OsX which it turns out is a rarity, if anyone has this
    Id love to hear that it actually works, there seems to be so many drivers and
    different versions of the IRDA that im worried it wont work with my phone at all,
    anyway if your interested.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ecost.com/ecost/shop/detail~dpno~241748.asp"
