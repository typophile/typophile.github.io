  Meaning, I am the last one interested enough in a post to comment.\r\n\r\nWhat does
  that bode?\r\n\r\nDoes that mean that I am turning people off, that my comments
  have doused any further attempts at conversation?\r\n\r\nOr does it mean that I
  have posted the definitive word, and that no further conversation is necessary?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mime-attachment_5847.jpeg]"

  body: That seems like it happens to me, too. I think it's one of those things that,
    because you only notice when it happens and not when it doesn't, it seems like
    it happens more often than it actually does.

    Simonson comment. Why should I? If I was, that would actually be kind of creepy!

    Not many people know that. I should look up this lettering Tommy Thompson guy.
