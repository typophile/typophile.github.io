    Neue, as the R kicks out a little more, but that ain't it either.\r\n\r\nHowever
    that's almost by the by.\r\n\r\nHi Rene -\r\n\r\nThere's no one way to successfully
    apply grunge effects to type. The best way to go about it is to experiment; this
    way you're likely to come across a method that works well for you personally.
    Firstly, remember that effects like this are based on the idea that the type has
    been applied to a surface. This means that the only way you're going to get the
    autheticity you want is by using images of REAL surfaces. If you want to create
    the impression that the type's been painted onto a wall, go and take some quality
    images of walls (or source them from a royalty-free stock library) and create
    your own textures by manipulating contrast and saturation.\r\n\r\nTextures have
    two primary uses in this instance:\r\n\r\n1. Adding to the shape of the text (e.g.
    for overspray). For this, I'd recommend desaturating the image completely, then
    increasing the contrast to create harder patterns and shapes. The less you increase
    the contrast, the softer and more textured the image will be. You can then play
    around with simple brushes, painting out areas that you wish to discard, dodging
    and burning, sharpening and softening. You can then apply layer styles to the
    images to either punch out areas of the text, or add details to the edges. It
    appears that, on Bruce's album, the grunge elements are in separate layers to
    the text itself, and they have been given individual textures in various hues
    and transparencies.\r\n\r\n2. Lending texture to the shape itself. This should
    be done later, when you have the first step sorted. Try applying a layer mask
    to the texture you wish to apply to the text/grunge element and pasting the text/grunge
    elements into the mask.\r\n\r\nUltimately you just have to try things out and
    feel your way along. Tutorials are only so useful; time and work will produce
    the gold.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: Interesting point, Bert. You could be right. If it's been designed by Columbia
    in-house, though, I can't imagine them giving the time or resources to create
    a genuine collage when it could so easily be faked in Photoshop. And although,
    as you say, the kerning and position is a bit wobbly, the letterforms are consistent
    in shape.

  body: "Tanks y'all!\r\nI also can't imagin that they didn't make/use a custom font.
    Would they make all the typography on album and single covers single handed?\r\n\r\nIf
    it isn't Helvetica (Neue), what could it be? \r\nUnivers' G doesn't have a spur
    indeed.\r\n\r\n@NJ: Thanks for your help. You're absolutelety right. It really
    is a matter of putting effort and work into projects. "
