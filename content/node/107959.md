  used the google search terms \"Modern sans serif font with line through middle,\"
  and other variations on this. Pier 1 Imports used this font throughout their store
  with all their branding for the fall/winter 2013 retail season. I just fell in love
  with the font and I'd love to use it in some of my designs. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n

  a ton,\r\n\r\n-Kelsey"
