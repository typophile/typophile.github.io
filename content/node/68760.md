    TARGET="_top">http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham</A> <BR> <BR>     A native
    New Yorker, Tobias celebrates his return to the city  <BR>     with GOTHAM, a
    new family of sans serifs in regular and  <BR>     condensed. Gotham takes both
    its name and its inspiration <BR>     from a type of public lettering common to
    New York -- these <BR>     are the plainspoken alphabets of shop windows and billboards,
    <BR>     rendered in paint, plaster, neon, glass and steel, which every <BR>     designer
    has admired at one time or another. <BR> <BR> <BR>Special Offer! <BR> <BR>     Right
    now, get Gotham Condensed for less than half price when  <BR>     you buy Gotham:  <BR>
