body: "For type history research I am undertaking, I am interested in finding the
  original German of a passage from Jan Tchichold's <em>Die neue Typographie</em>.
  It's just a select bit, so I thought I'd see if any typophiles had a German version
  at hand before I try to have one delivered to me.\r\n\r\nThe passage in question
  appears on p73-74 of the Ruari McLean translation, under the heading \"Type\":\r\n\r\n<cite>None
  of the typefaces to whose basic form some kind of ornament has been added (serifs
  in roman type, lozenge shapes and curlicues in fraktur) meet our requirements for
  clarity and purity. Among all the types that are available, the so-called \"Grotesque\"
  (sanserif) or \"block letter\" (\"<strong>skeleton letters</strong>\" would be a
  better name) is the only one in spiritual accordance with our time.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>To
  proclaim sanserif as the typeface of our time is not a question of being fashionable,
  it really does express the same tendencies to be seen in our architecture. It will
  not be long before not only the <strong>\"art\" typefaces</strong>, as they are
  sometimes called today, but also the classical typefaces, disappear, as completely
  as the contorted furniture of the eighties.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>There is no doubt
  that the sanserif types available today are not yet wholly satisfactory as all-purpose
  faces. The essential characteristics of this type have not been fully worked out:
  the lower-case letters especially are still <strong>too like their \"humanistic\"
  counterparts</strong>. Most of them, in particular the newest designs such as Erbar
  and Kabel, are inferior to the old anonymous sanserifs, and have <strong>modifications</strong>
  which place them basically in line with the rest of the \"art\" faces. As <strong>bread-and-butter
  faces</strong> they are less good than the old sans faces. Paul Renner's Futura
  makes a significant step in the right direction.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>But all the
  attempts up to now to produce a type for our time are merely \"improvements\" on
  the previous sanserifs: they are all still <strong>too artistic, too artificial,
  in the old sense</strong>, to fulfil what we need today.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Personally
  I believe that no single designer can produce the typeface we need, which must be
  <strong>free from all personal characteristics</strong>: it will be the work of
  a group, among whom I think there must be an engineer.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'd love to
  have the German original for this whole passage, but I'd also be grateful for any
  clues about what the German original of the phrases I have emphasized was.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    <em>Die Neue Typographie: Ein Handbuch f\xFCr zeitgem\xE4\xDF Schaffende</em>,
    1928. Berlin: Verlag des Bildungsverbandes der deutschen Buchdrucker. Pages 75\u201376.\r\n\r\n<strong>Schrift</strong>\r\nAlle
    Schriftformen, deren Wesen durch zum Skelett hinzutretende Ornamente (Schraffuren
    bei der Antiqua, Rauten und R\xFCssel bei der Fraktur) entstellt ist, entsprechen
    nicht unserem Streben nach Klarheit und Reinheit. Unter allen vorhandenen Schriftarten
    ist die sogenannte \u201EGrotesk\u201C oder Blockschrift (die richtige Bezeichnung
    w\xE4re \u201ESkelettschrift\u201C) die einzige, die unserer Zeit geistig gem\xE4\xDF
    ist.\r\nDie Proklamierung der Grotesk als der Schrift unserer Zeit ist nicht etwa
    eine Modeangelegenheit, sie entspricht durchaus den allgemeinen Tendenzen, z.B.
    denen in der Architektur. Die Zeit ist nicht mehr fern, wo nicht nur die K\xFCnstlerschriften
    (die dieses Los zum Teil schon heute trifft), sondern auch die \u201Eklassischen\u201C
    Schriften allgemein dieselbe Ablehnung erfahren werden, die heute etwa den Muschelm\xF6beln
    der achtziger Jahre zuteil wird.\r\nEs ist keine Frage, da\xDF die heute vorhandenen
    Groteskschriften den Anspr\xFCchen, die an eine vollkommene Schrift gestellt werden
    m\xFCssen, noch nicht ganz gen\xFCgen. Die spezifischen Eigent\xFCmlichkeiten
    dieser Schrift sind noch kaum herausgearbeitet, die Formen insbesondere der Kleinbuchstaben
    sind noch zu sehr von der humanistischen Minuskel abh\xE4ngig. Die meisten, und
    gerade die neuesten k\xFCnstlerischen Groteskschriften (z.B. Erbar-Grotesk und
    Kabel) zeigen, zu ihrem Nachteil gegen\xFCber den namenlosen \xE4lteren Grotesken,
    individuell modifizierte Bewegungen, die sie grunds\xE4tzlich in eine Linie mit
    den andern K\xFCnstlerschriften stellen. Als Brotschriften sind sie weniger gut
    als die alten Grotesken. Einen wesentlichen Schritt nach vorw\xE4rts bedeutet
    die Futura von Paul Renner.\r\nAber alle bisherigen Bem\xFChungen, die Schrift
    der neuen Zeit zu schaffen, gehen nur um eine \u201EVerbesserung\u201C der bisherigen
    Grotesk; es fehlt allen diesen Versuchen, die noch viel zu artistisch, zu \u201Ek\xFCnstlerisch\u201C
    im fr\xFCheren Sinne sind, die notwendige grunds\xE4tzliche Einstellung.\r\nIch
    pers\xF6nlich glaube, da\xDF es nicht einem einzelnen vorbehalten sein kann, die
    Schrift unseres Zeitalters zu schaffen, die von jeder pers\xF6nlichen Linienf\xFChrung
    frei sein m\xFC\xDFte. Sie wird das Werk mehrerer sein, unter denen sich wohl
    auch ein Ingenieur befinden m\xFCsste.\r\n"

    (Berlin, 1928), page 75\r\n\r\nRuari McLean\u2019s translation reads well, and
    his knowledge of German was certainly better than mine is, but I have never been
    happy with the way he handled that famous passage on the sanserif. It seems to
    me to soften some key words in a passage of which the language is quite strong
    and powerful. McLean\u2019s version is:\r\n\r\nNone of the typefaces to whose
    basic form some kind of ornament has been added (serifs in roman type, lozenges
    and curlicues in fraktur) meet our requirements for clarity and purity. Among
    all the types that are available, the so-called \u2018Grotesque\u2019 (sanserif)
    or \u2018block letter\u2019 (\u2018skeleton letters\u2019 would be a better name)
    is the only one in spiritual accordance with our time.\r\n\r\nI would suggest
    something more like this:\r\nTypes of which the essential form is degraded by
    added ornaments \u2013 like serifs in roman type, the points and snouts of Fraktur
    \u2013 fail to satisfy our striving for clarity and purity. Of all the types that
    are currently available, the so-called \u2018grotesque\u2019 or \u2018block letter\u2019
    (the right name would be \u2018skeleton letter\u2019) is the only one that adequately
    meets the spirit of our time.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that <em>Wesen</em> is a far
    more powerful and elemental term than McLean\u2019s bland \u201Cbasic form\u201D.
    And the <em>ent</em> prefix in <em>entstellt</em> suggests deviation, even perversion
    \u2013 so the essential meaning is \u201Cdegraded\u201D. Think of the modern paintings
    that the Nazis hated and destroyed. McLean\u2019s reference to \u201Cadded\u201D
    ornament is quite neutral. And \u201Crequirements\u201D seems an equally flat
    term for Tschichold\u2019s <em>Streben</em> \u2013 \u201Cstriving\u201D for purity
    and clarity. And if you think, as I do, that such \u201Cstriving for purity\u201D
    has slightly sinister political and even racial overtones, then remember when
    and where this was written. It seems to me that, as a piece of writing, it inevitably
    reflects the spirit of his time, but it is also characteristic of the writer.
    Even in his later essays, the \u201Cclassical\u201D Tschichold could be very loud
    in denouncing tiny points of typographic detail that he thought were \u201Cwrong\u201D.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the \u201Cart typefaces\u201D (<em>K\xFCnstlerschriften</em>) some lines further
    on, the translator's problem here is that they did not really happen in Britain
    or the USA, so there is no word for them. At least one can\u2019t find easily
    find a type made with the same kind of intention as the one that the young Klingspor
    brothers commissioned from Otto Eckmann, and for which they gave him two closely-packed
    pages in the specimen to say what he was trying to do, which was to make a type
    than was neither as illegible as, so he claims, the types based on older models
    were (I think he had Jenson-style types like Morris\u2019s Golden in mind) nor
    as ugly and banal as the more modern ones, presumably the English-style \u201Cmodern\u201D
    faces that were then used for some German technical and scientific printing.\r\n\r\nTschichold
    dismisses the \"artists' types\" as self-indulgent exercises, which in many cases
    may have been true but is unfair on Eckmann, who had given up painting to turn
    to the design of handmade objects, and who complains of the unsoundness of furniture
    made from the sketches of designers who lack a sense of construction. Is there
    an English translation of his piece? Maybe someone should attempt one.\r\n\r\nAt
    any rate, can someone improve on my attempt at Tschichold\u2019s paragraph.\r\n\r\n"

    was editor of this special edition of Typographische Mitteilungen. On 24 pages,
    Tschichold gave a concise overview of the \u201Anew typography\u2018, as it was
    developed by Russian Constructivist artists and adopted in the Netherlands by
    De Stijl and in Germany by the Bauhaus. He showed samples of work by Lissitzky,
    Moholy-Nagy and others, and he compiled a few short articles. Because of its compactness
    it has almost the characteristics of a manifesto, and in its style and language
    it is much stronger (and rougher) than \u201ADie neue Typographie\u2018. \u201AElementare
    Typographie\u2018 was the rough sketch that shows the sources of its ideas clearer
    than \u201ADie neue Typographie\u2018. It\u2018s a pity that it got somehow a
    bit forgotten and that there is no English translation available.\r\n\r\nIn his
    introductory article, Tschichold devoted a whole paragraph to a quote by Trotzky
    (from \u201ALiterature and art\u2018):\r\n \r\n\u201AThe wall between art and
    industry will come down. The great style of the future will be formative, not
    ornamental. (...) But it would be wrong to look at this as a liquidating of art,
    as a voluntary giving way to technique. (...) In accord with the entire tendency
    of industrial culture, we think that the artistic imagination in creating material
    objects will be directed towards working out the ideal form of a thing, as a thing,
    and not towards the embellishment of the thing as an aesthetic premium to itself.\u2018\r\n\r\nProbably
    this quote helps to see the context Tschichold had (in my opinion) in mind when
    he wrote about the \u201AStreben nach Klarheit und Reinheit\u2018."

    reprint.) That's where he calls the Grotesk, with its light, semibold, bold, and
    condensed to wide versions, the \u2018elemental letterform' (<em>elementare Schriftform</em>).
    Or does he just mean \u2018basic'?\r\n\r\nAnother relevant text (although I don't
    think he concerns himself with the choice of type) is of course Moholy Nagy's
    essay in the Bauhaus catalogue of 1923, which used the title <em>The New Typography</em>
    before Tschichold did. (Although you can't see the detail in this low-res image,
    I love the way in which the fourth E in the title is made up of thick rules. Presumably
    there were only three cap E's in the fount. You couldn't do that with roman or
    gothic types. Another plus for the sanserif.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Moholy

    his collected essays.\r\n\r\nIn the context of <em>K\xFCnstlerschriften</em> I
    cited Eckmann's sober defence of attention to legibility and respect for function.
    However I've been trying to keep up my German with the 1908 printing of <em>Die
    Nibelungen</em> in the 1908 edition with illustrations by Czeschka and set in
    the Eckmann type (Insel Verlag pocket version). Looks stunning, but for reading,
