  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey everyone,

I've read typophile for quite a while but this is the first time posting.  I am currently starting a website redesign for a practice that deals with infertility.  From our first meeting, I gathered that their identity needs to appeal to both the more emotive side of couples trying to conceive while still being professional, scientific, modern etc.

I was given the go ahead to ignore their current logo/identity (or lack there of) and there is possibility after the website launch to redesign their logo, stationary etc.  That said I want to start with a solid ground that could eventually turn into a logotype or set the tone of a new logo.  This site is very text heavy so it's only natural that I go for a typographic solution.  This is just a first go at selecting two typefaces for the company that I think look nice.

So please! Comments, ideas, suggestions.  I really want to explore all possible possibilities!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Exploring possibilities that don’t involve a 71 character logo. Start by slashing it to SJFC and design a graphic to go with it. Treat the full text as an optional tagline that can be handled for best fit. And don’t use a classical serif—your clients need to be giving prospective mothers warm fuzzies; the dour lawyer look just will not do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree James and I have considered cutting down to SJFC.  I'm not considering this as a 71 character logo, just as a type treatment to help define the style of the rest of the site.  I'll give a go at exploring initials and see what appropriate typefaces I can come up with.  

My other concern is, the nurses at the practice want cute baby pictures plastered everywhere and the doctors want to talk about how cutting edge their technology and techniques are.  I'm having a hard time finding that healthy middle ground.

I guess my first instinct was to go more dour, then soften it up with color..  Perhaps there's a clean friendly sans-serif to try?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Baby pictures need to be present but limited. Obviously it’s important to drive home the notion that the clinic produced babies, but you don’t want to overdo it and make potential clients feel like failures for not having babies. As for the doctors and the tech…it’s unnecessary. People who want to have kids don’t give a damn about the details and would gladly pay to be anally inseminated with dull acupuncture needles if it worked. Give the doctors a tech section to make them happy and keep it from overwhelming the entire site. 

As for the font: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/">Museo</a> gives you sans and serifs to work with. The humanist, almost geometric proportions give it a warmth that’s appropriate as well.</div>
