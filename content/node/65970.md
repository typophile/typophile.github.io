body: "There seem to be a couple of bugs with InDesign CS3 & CS4 that affect the characters
  that can be included in a font.\r\n\r\nFirst: If Unicode characters 2002 through
  200B are included in a font, InDesign CS3 and CS4 will crash under certain circumstances.
  Specifically, if you enter 9 (nine) em spaces in a line and uni2003 is included
  in a font, IDCS3 and IDCS4 crash. We learned of this while setting a Cataloging-in-Publication
  page, where you often get 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 (signifying print runs) separated
  by an em-space. Turns out it doesn't really matter if it is an em, en, thin, whatever,
  just any combination of 9 characters from uni2002 through uni200B on a single line.\r\n\r\nIt
  has to be nine characters. Eight is fine, 10 is fine. We got around this by putting
  the numbers on two lines, and used two en-spaces between one group. When the return
  was deleted, we had *10* space characters from this region in the line, and the
  program didn't crash.\r\n\r\nI suppose this argues for leaving such characters out
  of a font. But not all layout programs treat spaces as a part of the program rather
  than the font. And some people already include 2000 through 200B in their fonts
  -- SIL Charis, for example. It does seem a bug worthy of a fix when a sequence of
  valid Unicode characters crashes a program. But it's each font designer's call;
  the way we proved out the bug was to simply to remove these characters from the
  font, regenerate the .otf, & rely on InDesign's routines for the spaces. No crash
  with the characters removed.\r\n\r\nThe second bug occurs when there are no characters
  in the Private Use region of E020 through E07E. If there are no such characters
  in a font, and you enter the Unicode sequence from the keyboard with ID-CS2, 3 (and
  I think 4), the program places the characters from the Controls and Basic Latin
  plane -- i.e., a space through an ASCII tilde (0020 through 007E).\r\n\r\nThis might
  argue for putting the glyph used for .notdef in E020 through E07E if you're not
  using them for some purpose. That would at least let somebody know there could be
  a problem with the document. While it would be unusual for somebody to enter such
  characters from the keyboard, I, for one, have been known to make mistakes when
  keying . . .\r\n\r\nFWIW,\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "Charles, thanks for the feedback.\r\nI was able to reproduce the second problem
    and filed a bug. However, I'm unable to reproduce the first issue. I tried both
    ID CS4 (v6.0.3) and CS3 (v5.0.4) using Charis SIL Regular (v4.100). Here are the
    steps I did:\r\n\r\n1. Launch ID CS4\r\n2. Create a new document\r\n3. Create
    a new text frame\r\n4. Select the font \"Charis SIL Regular\"\r\n5. Type the sequence
    \"10\u20039\u20038\u20037\u20036\u20035\u20034\u20033\u20032\u20031\"\r\n\r\nNo
    crash happened. Can you please retest this or provide more info? Thanks."

  body: "Miguel, thanks for taking an interest in this. I know Adobe doesn't use uni2002-uni200B,
    and not many other people do either. \r\n\r\nWe tried our test again, starting
    with a new document and your procedure. This did not produce the crash. As I'm
    sure you know, debugging can be a painful process, esp. as we started things on
    a 64-bit Vista machine running a plug-in dictionary.\r\n\r\nTo start clean with
    ID CS4, we used my 32-bit Vista machine with the box-stock proximity dictionary.
    I was able to get the program to fail converting 9 em spaces, but not quite as
    simply as originally described.\r\n\r\nWhat we did to recreate the problem was
    to open a new document, create a new text frame (font Consula), type in two lines
    of gibberish, type in a third line of 9-em spaces. Now highlight the em spaces
    and change the font to Charis SIL. Repeated this test several times. Sometime
    the failure was immediate, sometimes a further action such as *zoom* or *file
    save* was needed. We opened & saved a new document between each failure to try
    & clear anything ID was hanging on to.\r\n\r\nNot to say it isn't a problem we
    created, we do some oddball stuff. BTW, it doesn't seem to be just Charis SIL,
    I also tried one of my modified fonts which include the U+2002-U+200B characters,
    with the same result. I'm not looking forward to going back into those fonts to
    take the offending characters out.\r\n\r\nI've sent you the file and a screen
    shot of the message that appears when the program quits.\r\n\r\nCharles"
