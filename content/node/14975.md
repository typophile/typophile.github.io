body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is Chile sans, a typeface for identity and reading. This \"new\"
  font its different form my past chile sans font with inverted contrast(who will
  be in stand by). Well, the concept behind the face is to make a font to be used
  by chilean graphic designers.\r\nI will post advances for my new Chile sans font
  from today to the letras latinas 2006 exposition. The font include:\r\nRegular,
  Bold, Italic, headline and Icons.\r\nThis is the current version of Chile, in headline.
  Your comments are welcome as always :)\r\n\r\nmh"

  body: "Hi,\r\nDid you change the space between the uc 'C' and lc 'h' in your (white
    on red) user picture? It looks slightly different to the 'Chile' in the (white
    on black) sample you provided. The C|h and the l|e do need a little less whitespace,
    I would say (also compared to l|a at the beginning). The S|a|n looks a bit odd
    (does the curved stem of 'a' need more whitespace to the right?)\r\nOverall, it
    looks very nice, I like the rounded caps and the low height of the uppercase letters.\r\n\u2013
    is 'Chile Sans' the proposed name of the font? I doubt that there are intrinsic
    values of nationality to a typeface, but this is your decision, of course."

    body: "Stephan,\r\n\r\nThank you for your critique on the space between gliphs.
      I try to upload a pdf but it seem that typophile was a bug when i did. I will
      upload it tomorrow. About the name of the font, i will keep it. What is the
      difference using a name of a person, city, country or planet? My intention is
      to bring Chile to Chilean designers. About the design, it is inspired on early
      sans serifs, vernacular fonts (tipografia.cl old site) and of course, teh amzing
      work of Teff and Underware.\r\nNow in spanish: Este trabajo ser{a mi primer
      intento serio de una tipografia para textos impresos que mostrar\xE9 en Letraslatinas
      2006, lo que me tiene muy motivado, pronto les linkeare a un blog para recibir
      mas comentarios de dise\xF1adores.\r\nThis month is the independence of Chile,
      on september 18, what an amazing time to show the proyect too :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nmh."

  body: "Really interesting typeface. Overall I like the personality of this type
    face. \r\nI'd suggest few things :\r\na: seems unbalanced. Probably the top is
    too long to the right or the bowl is too short.\r\ng: the connection between the
    two storeys is too in the middle. His ear would be better if it had an other terminal,
    something like \xABa\xBB or \xABs\xBB terminal? \r\nr: I would rework the top
    terminal. May be like the terminal of the \xABt\xBB.\r\nB,R: the top bowl is too
    big compare to the bottom one.\r\nH,E,F : the middle bar is also too low."

    title=\"Chile Sans 2004\">previous effort</a> was excellent, and it is still better
    than this new one. The 2004 typeface is not only innovative, it is funky and well
    crafted; the new one is just cutesy, too soft.\r\nAnyway, the proportions remind
    me of <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep?cview=P71923Q&clist=PQ\">FF

    mucho los tipos antiguos como gill sans, futura, las garamond, etc, pero en verdad...

  body: "Hey, Gracias for your comments guys!\r\nThere are a lot of motivation behind
    Chile sans, i will use a blog too for updates and discuss about thsi font, and
    other chilean and latinamerican identity fonts who i am working on..\r\n\r\n-
    Please visit: http://chilediseno.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nBTW, There are 2 new attachs
    in teh first post, updated: the regular version and somo fixations..\r\n\r\nSim:
    there are some middle bar lower proportions who are axagerated, but is for a clear
    reason: friendlyness appearence. I want to fix it a little if got problems with
    legibility, but the idea is to mantain the proportions from humanistic a and e
    counterforms equal for the mixed open and close counterforms from A, R, etc.\r\n\r\nEduardo:
    The previous effort will be a different font, with a new name. Now Chile sans
    its too soft because of the friendly appearence that i want to add on it, specially
    to make a great difference with other sans fonts like Meta, who are more serious,
    i will keep the idea to use sans for signage for example, but with latin cute
    tasty favour, just like vernacular Chilean signage.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nmh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    what would you say on how we got the \"style name\" Italic? Ok, in Spanish it's
    \"letra grifa\": in homage to Francesco Griffo, cut for Aldo Manuzio, Venezia,
    Italia. Don't know if Chile could be represented, but surely I would not identify
    Miguel's work with Africa or Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Question and Exclamation Marks
    look somewhat close to the ones in Alejandro LoCelso's Australis (which is definitely
    good!). Do they come from vernacular forms?"
