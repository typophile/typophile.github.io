  the virtual edition of the mag: http://anthologymag.com/blog3/issues/. I can upload
  a scanned portion if needed. Is it Baskerville? It has that very distinct upper-case
  Q. If it is Baskerville, is it a new version? I can''t figure out why it looks different
  than other Baskervilles I''ve seen. It looks more modern and updated and I think
  there is more space between letters. Thanks!'
