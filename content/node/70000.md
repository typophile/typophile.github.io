body: Hi everybody, I have a document with some paragraphs starting with drop caps
  that needs to be translated in various non latin alphabeths. I can imagine that
  drop caps don't have any sense in arabic since all letters are tied together, but
  would it make any sense in Greek?

  body: The newspaper Al-Shabiba of Oman uses drop caps on its <a href=http://garciamedia.com/images/blog/Shabopinion_thumb.png>features
    page</a>, but perhaps it's not common practice.

  body: thank you very much, really helpful info that confirms what i thought. i will
    stick to drop caps in greek but don't think i will use them in arabic, i think
    it would look strange to detach letters that have to be attached.

  body: Glad to help. I'm not a native Arabic, but Arabic letters do have a normal
    form in which they are not attached to other letters (called isolated). So it's
    certainly possible that it's not usual in the Arabic-reading world, but it's not
    entirely an imposition. (Certainly not like italicizing Arabic!)

    strange</cite>\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Arabic allows very decorative typography
    (the limits reside more on the software side. For example, you will need the Middle-East
    version of InDesign to properly set a text in Arabic).\r\nYou could want to ask
    in a more specialised place:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/366"
