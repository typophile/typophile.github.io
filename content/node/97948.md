  and it almost done, but not exactly...\r\nMaybe It is really written by the hand
  and It`s not a font??\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "Two different /e/ and /t/ characters leads me to believe that this may be
    hand-lettered\u2014or a font with extended OT features, including randomization.
    It has the same kind of vibe as a lot of the Art &amp; Sign or SignDNA brush fonts,
    but neither of their product line are too OT savvy\u2026"
