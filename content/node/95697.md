  make this logo 3D, but all the client has is this image. Obviously, in order to
  remake it I need to know what font it it is, but she has no idea. [[http://www.nrvairshow.com/index_files/image2931.jpg|Here's
  the logo]].\r\n\r\nI need to know what font was used for the \"NRV Skyfest\" and
  the \"Airshow\" text. She said that someone at the local newspaper designed it for
  her 5 months ago.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can identify it so I can make the logo
  look newer and better. Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thank you so much! For the life of me I couldn't figure out what font it
      was. As to the font for the \"NRV SkyFest\", I found a font that's very similar
      that should work.\r\n\r\n Once again, thank you so much for your help!"
