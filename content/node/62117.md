    Unica</a>. Compare to this:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/bauldoff/2389098041/\r\nHard
    to tell if it's the original (which is not available anymore), or maybe a new
    interpretation? We've had a couple of those recently."

    it is Unica indeed, although I did not recognize it by the looks of it. I did
    recognize the way Compugraphic presented its typefaces in one of its old catalogs
    that I have. Where did you find the image that you posted?\r\n\r\nBoris"

    as all digital typefoundries and quite a number of typeface designers themselves

    just alter typeface names), who is to stop anyone from reconstructing Haas Unica

    if anyone can say why this is no longer available. I have a copy of it from years
    ago that I purchased from Scangraphic.\"\r\n \r\nBesides the numerous threads
    here at Typophile that mentioned some aspects of the Haas Unica copyrights and
    unavailability, at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/swiss.html\r\n\r\nOne
    can find the reason why Haas Unica is no longer available and about its copyright\u2019s
    controversies.\r\n\r\nStephen Coles wrote:\r\n\r\n-\"Scangraphics Digital Type
    Collection (which included Haas Unica) was purchased by Elsner + Flake in 2003,
    to which they added font-specific Euro and @ symbols in 2004. The revamped typeface
    was set to be sold by Scangraphic and its distributors, but Linotype is currently
    preventing the release, citing trademark violations. Although similarities to
    other typefaces often occur between foundries, it is rare that one finds typefaces
    that have been shelved indefinitely due to such resemblances. In truth, the real
    problem lies within a dispute over who owns the name Haas Unica, rather than any
    resemblance infringment. Haas Unica is commercially unavailable thanks to Linotype
    and Scangraphic. Linotype especially stands to lose a lot of Helvetica money if
    it ever appears.\" \r\n\r\n- \"As to Nymus\u2019s comment: who is to stop anyone
    from reconstructing Haas Unica by interpolating Helvetica and Univers and fine
    tuning the result following the specs posted at Flickr? I can only speak for myself,
    but what would be the fun in that?\"\r\n\r\nGood point if one already has Haas
    Unica, but if one doesn\u2019t and wants to buy it and can\u2019t, it becomes
    an entirely different matter\u2026 It becomes something like the search for the
    Holy Grail\u2026\r\n\r\n- \"Much better to look at what has been done before and
    try to do something that builds on that work.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe designing a humanist
    Haas Unica as it was done Stone Humanist or DIN Next or what else do you have

    did not make this comment because I already have Unica. I made this comment as
    a type designer who sees no point in slavishly copying the past. In fact I had

    30% Helvetica, 30% Univers ( or two other Grotesques) and 60% Frutiger Next or
