body: "Not a font by me, just one I stumbled across recently, from Lazydogs (Germany).
  So I hope this is the right category to post it in. (I tried posting this yesterday
  as a postscript to a fascinating Garamond-and-inkspread thread, but it's been dead
  too long and nobody goes there any more.)\r\n\r\nSee it <a href=\"http://www.lazydogs.de/fabiol\">here</a>
  (+ PDF sample)\r\n\r\nAs yet unmentioned on Typophile it seems. Not exactly a Garamond
  in the usual sense (if there is one) but I don\u2019t think I have ever seen anything
  that captures the warm flow of original Renaissance letterpress pages quite like
  this. Just enough softness and irregularities (almost quirks when enlarged) to prevent
  any kind of dazzle or \"lateral interference\", and beautiful spacing for small
  sizes. Maybe it is almost too historical/imitative to be used for regular jobs,
  but it looks like an impressive piece of work. I would love to hear what the experts
  think about it."

    have made something very nice, it maybe unusable for most part of the people in
    daily grafic live. And often \u2013 at least it\u2019s may feeling about it \u2013
    it\u2019s also too sad to do so. Because the beautiful characters of the past
    maybe are not made for publicity or corporate purposes. Seems they are somehow
    misplaced there.\r\n\r\nbye\r\nStefan"
