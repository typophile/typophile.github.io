  body: '"Michigan Challenge" is set in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_busorama_std_virtual/?&sample_text=MICHIGAN%20CHALLENGE&update=0">Busorama</a>,
    and "Anniversary" is set in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_pro_virtual/">Avant
    Garde</a>. And I think the 25 is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?&q=zapfino&sample_text=25&update=0">Zapfino</a>.'
