  out the Epiduo acne treatment commercials and website, or the art of James Victore,
  or the pathetic new Hallmark ad campaign.  \r\n\r\nAll of this can be dated back
  to when designers like Paul Rand experimented with informal and abstract lettering
  for ads.\r\n\r\nI like Paul Rand's work a lot.  Don't get me wrong.  His well-disciplined
  examples command praise.  Cummins diesel engines is still using his logo today.
  \ ABC is still using his logo today.  So do IBM and Westinghouse.  It's just that
  he made mediocre letterforms famous as well.\r\n\r\nNow, any dumb schmoe with a
  set of pens who think they can draw can create juvenile lettering and PRESTO!  It's
  all over the advertising landscape like a cancer!\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope wrote this
  on vice...\r\n\r\n\"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien\r\nAs to be hated needs
  but to be seen;\r\nYet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\nWe first endure,
  then pity, then embrace.\" \r\n\r\nWe are living in an age where bad is the new
  good."
