This is the very beginning of a new logo. It has started on a piece of paper and this is the first digitized draft (and just a draft). I'm deliberately not providing any additional info on the logo, because I would like to hear from your:

<ul>
<li>critique of this draft</li>
<li>associations/emotions you get by looking at it</li>
<li>what came to your mind when you first saw it</li>
<li>what industry you think could be suitable for</li>
<li>what other ideas may popped up your mind</li>
<li>any suggestions you may have</li>
</ul>

Thank you very much.

		<div class="commentbody">Looks like I'm a bit off. But the thing is when I look at logos from various companies they don't always tell you directly what the company/business is about. So first of all:

<ul>
<li>this logo is for a company that's primarily in agile software development business but a part of it also in graphic design; that's why all the colors.</li>
<li>Pleiado is derived out of Pleiades, seven stars, that are also related to <em>similar minded group of people</em>, which relates to team software development.</li>
<li>circles represented as bubbles are just part of this draft; they may be replaced with anything; stars as well...</li>
<li>bubbles start on top of the "i" to replace the dot on it.</li>
<li>bubbles overlap to give a sense of dimension</li>
<li>lifting shapes (in draft's case bubbles) give a sense of lightness that I can easily relate to Agile principles</li>
</ul>

@Bendy: I agree I could place bubbles (shapes) more sporadically to not pose an exact shape and make them more playful

@ricardo: I thought to deliberately overlap shapes in the final version (possibly with a hint of transparency) to relate logo to visual aspect of company's business (graphic desing).

<strong>@everyone</strong> I definitely didn't intend to relate this logo to pharmaceutical industry. The thing is <strong>I don't know how to relate agile software development</strong> with visual elements. I don't have a workable idea. Except growing/composing shapes/sizes/weights... but that's just growth. No agile-ness in it.

I still want to make this logo professional but not bound to square/round shape.

I thought I could place lifting smoke over type... It would make my logo design a bigger challenge (think of Silverlight logo), especially because I MUST make it work in BW as well.

<strong>Now that you know much more, would you change your opinion or suggest new things or give some additional observations and directions?</strong> Please do.

Thank you very much and I hope you will all (at least the ones that did so far) reply again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't have a clue what agile software entails, but I think the concept could work. This kind of logo works really well as it defines a palette that can be used on all different communications.

Agile seems to include the idea of quick movement so give the bubbles/stars a bit more freedom. I'd lose the gradient fills and be really selective about the colours used. If you could invent a shape instead of bubbles or stars, that could be used on its own as a mark for other things. And don't you need seven bubbles to fit the reference properly?</div>

I can tell you as a professional computer programmer - "agile software development" is a marketing speak of a fad variety. Meaning that the logo needs to work for the marketing people in the first place. It needs to be "cool and hip", but other than that it can be anything.</div>

Otherwise your idea is visually more in direction that I'd like to take. Breaking the box of rigid logo that's encapsulated inside a visual square-ish box. Your constellation breaks it. You can't visually put it in a box.

Don't you think that using direct constellation positions would imply on astronomy related business? I could of course position these "stars" in any way I would like.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yeah the 'agile' nature relates to flexibility, so it seems like a perfect oppotunity to create something that is dynamic in its delivery, i.e, the overall concept and mark don't change, but the lines can connect any number of stars or point to one star, it's flexible without changing.

As random dots, they don't even have to be stars. Adding the m6.4 bit just brought some more scientific bent to the overll feel. Original thought after you mentioned stars was the softwareology, which could either be cheesy or effective. Ology = A combining form meaning "the science or study of".

I literally threw it together in a minute, more as a "could be something more in this" rather than "here's a fleshed out concept".

		<div class="commentbody">Well perhaps in the native country things should just be fine.

But for me, the question is in the middle vowels. Obviously there's at least 2 ways to stress each vowel and there's three vowels in a row, which makes for a lot of possible combinations of how to pronounce the name.

Now I don't expect you to be changing the name, but I also don't know how set in stone it is. My particular concern was that your audience can't say the name correctly. Personally, I would always want them to "get it" right away, just the same as I don't like people mispronouncing my own name.

But for the business, is it detrimental? Will people be likely to remember the name if they aren't sure of which way to pronounce it in the first place? Same goes for a recommendation of your business--will the person who is told, "Play-ee-ah-do," (or whatever) "does great work, you should go with them." Will they remember?

Perhaps it's wont affect leads--that would be based on your business model and how and where you approach your marketing.

So litera I'm curious what you think, and if it's not a problem why--it's always fun for me to think through things and learn something in the process.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@evanbrog: This company has been up and running since last summer. It's not a standard-as-you-know-em company, but rather works with individual clients on a case-by-case one-by-one basis. Company name isn't really a brand and it probably never will be. So the name isn't a problem in this regard, if you ask me. I do agree that this name is very well chosen, but I could be wrong. If there's going to be an end product of some sort from this company, it's going to bear its own brand.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ricard0: If you stretch your imagination you can see Pleiades as an arrow... Look up in the sky. They don't really look as an arrow at all. If it was Andromeda... Then I wouldn't argue. On Vladimir's link the do look like an arrow but they don't look like that to naked eye, because light is excessively emphasized on the image. Rather look at Ratbaggy's version of the logo that shows the constellation in more natural look and feel. I don't really see an arrow there.

But I would probably rather avoid using exact constellation positions, to separate the logo from astronomy, because the company has nothing to do with it. I tend to use number 7 and keep the logo open and unboxed... In some way or another. Stretching the limits. Anyway.

I will have to somehow replace those circles-wanna-be's with something else for them to not look as bubbles.</div>

By the way why do you need to combine the logo with the name why not a separate graphic logo? The Pleiades photo shows cross-like diffraction pattern artifacts over each star, maybe extending those in an abstract way you get a sort of techno-graph look suitable for software.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Putting a symbol separate from type would do something I would like to avoid. It would separate the whole logo in two parts. Probably making the whole logo visually contained inside a square-ish box. Keeping them separate leaves the whole logo more free an un-boxed. Basically agile development is about adaptability of the process and product functionality. So it's rather free but still connected to the whole end product.

The other idea I'm also willing to get across is the design aspect of the business. Design as an art is also rather free and unlimited.

These two are the main reasons why I'd like to have a bit different logo.

<strong>EVERYBODY:</strong>
Does anyone know of any logo with a symbol and type that are not put inside a certain box? SO symbol is all around type and vice-a-versa...? I would be more than glad to check those out and how they work as a logo.</div>

There could totally be something in this direction. My initial reaction was "it feels like a game of chance".

So...to that end, if the concept were to work (in my opinion) there would need to be a feeling of 'control' or 'organisation'...without feeling like a magician (I don't think juggler is the right way to go, too fun?).

More geometric shapes/arrangement would help with this 'organisation'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm still puzzled with this logo. I just can't seem to decide what should I use. On one hand I like the logo that is boundless, but the problem it has is that it doesn't have a symbol. It always has to be together with type.

On the other hand I like a single symbol, that doesn't require type, but I can't seem to find something useful that would be mainly related to development. And I don't want to use any cliches (like monitor, key from a keyboard, globe with a swoosh etc. that are mainly used with IP development companies).

I don't know what would be clever.

I'm still leaning toward logo with circles (wannabe) around type, but I don't know if using circles is ok. They seem too basic. Sharp stars are not style compatible... I also have a great idea about business cards. type would be printed but circles around it would be punched out. Which would make for an unusual and interesting effect.

The only thing I'm sure of is type. I'd very much like the versatile style of <b>PF Square Sans Pro</b>...

Anyway. Here's one more new path I took...

I know you may say that it reminds you of Mont Blanck... But I use seven stars on a squarish circle... Thinking of it... Just because of this fact it was probably a total waste of time...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Definitely not the pd ones (1st column 3rd and 4th down).

The dotted ones are not working for me either. I think dots need to form a meaningful shape for them to be usable without a wordmark. Perhaps try building a P out of them?

I really like 4th down in 4th column. If it was meant to be a take on @, then it's spot on. Very Internet-ish.

Another observation, may or may not be helpful - there are seven letters in the name.

The idea with binary notation is probably going to be lost on a vast majority of viewers, programmers included. I would've not deciphered it, and I am a Comp Sci major. There is however something in the idea. Perhaps use 7 somethings in a row and shade 3 last of them differently? Though in this case 8 somethings would make more sense...

Anyway. These @-like signs have to be tweaked to complement the style and shape of letters. thanks for your comment @apankrat.</div>

I must as well say that I'm sorry for posting so many indecisive versions of the logo. The main problem that I'm having is originality. The one with scattered dots/circles is not really useful as a logo I guess (because it doesn't really have a symbol even though there's graphic used in it). And I haven't found a good logo with similar approach that is clever and I could say: "ok this is the way to go."</div>

Here's a colour version of the last logo that I kinda like even though all it has is a "7". That's the most relation to Pleiades as I can think of with this symbol. This symbol is as close to type style as I can make it. So instead of making pure square I've rounded it, also making some vague relation to a computer monitor (duh)...

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pleiado XIII Colour_5467.jpg]

with some zoomed-in detail:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pleiado XIII Colour (Detail)_6108.jpg]

I must admit (against much liking from you guys) that my version of "P as @" is not really working, because it seems too busy. Maybe it would work if the curve around "p" would be a bit bigger so it wouldn't be too close to the letter, but unfortunately it would be quite hard to make the connection with it on the left side and still keeping it symmetric on the right side...</div>

I've tried putting type lower (a bit further away from the symbol), but they looked too disconnected. Anyway. I realised that I don't like this logo too much because I may have a problem with the local mobile provider <em>Mobitel</em> with this logo (brilliant in my opinion). It's not that company businesses compete for the same market, but this logo has a very strong brand...

		<div class="commentbody">@Ratbaggy: I'm not sure I understand what you're asking? Would you like to say that:
<ul>
<li>you <strong>always</strong> have to finish a logo in much less than a month or</li>
<li>you're never able to finish a logo in less than few months...</li>
</ul>

If your problem is the first one, than you'll have to convince your customers that a long-to-be-used-logo is a complex process that can't be done in a few sketches and digitised in a week. On some rare lightning-strikes occasions when you get a really great idea in the first second and also execute it perfectly.

In my case, meetings usually stretch on a longer time scale so even with a great idea I wouldn't be able to finish it in less than a month. Usually.</div>

Are you charging your client per hour for all the time you brainstorm? How many hours are you up to now and how do you justify it to your client if they question it? </div>

This word is floating amongst the stars. It's engaging, deep, and meaningful.

I disagree entirely with the notion that the stars are merely a background to the logo. They ARE the logo.

Refer to the Bahamas logo:

I know this is a little late, but I really feel that this direction is the strongest and most interesting. The stars only need to be stronger.</div>
