body: "Ever since I \"upgraded\" to FontLab 5.2, when I do quick font tests, I get
  an error message saying that the OS/2 ascender and descender values don't equal
  the bounding box, and it happens whether or not I choose the automatic calculation
  (as recommended), or choose custom values, and let FontLab recalculate.\r\n\r\nIf
  I ignore the message, the fonts that are generated generally clip the accents on
  uppercase letters, and the cedilla on the uppercase AND lowercase C. At the risk
  of sounding somewhat Seinfeldish, what's up with that?"
