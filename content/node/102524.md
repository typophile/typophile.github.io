  body: Hard to say, very generic and neutral, not too much distinctive letters and
    even adding /W and /R to the glyph set (from [[http://landingpage.maxon.net|this
    page]])... Gotham Rounded is actually a good alternative. I've also found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento|Novecento]]
    (very close but not rounded), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/houschka-alt-pro|Houschka
    Alternate]] (/W and /R off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/solomon-sans|Solomon
    Sans]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/gabriel-sans|Gabriel Sans]]
    (as many [[http://fontfabric.com/category/all-fonts|FontFabric]] fonts actually).
