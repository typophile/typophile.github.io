body: 'I''m noticing this more and more in job postings. People want me to be proficient
  or expert or skilled in a long list of design apps, and usually at the top of the
  list is Quark <em>and</em> InDesign. I''ve used InDesign for years. I''ve had formal
  schooling on it. I know lots about it. I''ve never been exposed to Quark aside from
  reading about it. My question is: what am I missing exactly (by not being familiar
  with Quark)? Would I be limited to using which ever was available any given day,
  as opposed to just using the one of my choice? Should I be expected to use both
  because of the limitations of either? Is there interoperability between the two
  that I don''t know about? I''m not looking to revive the battle between the two
  products to determine which is best, but rather could you please help me understand
  why so many potential employers are saying one <em>and</em> the other; not one or
  the other?'

  body: "Hey there. By way of full disclosure, I've used QuarkXPress for a long time,
    and it is only in the last two to three years that I have had to learn and use
    Adobe InDesign at work.\r\n\r\nNow on to your question: my experience is that
    you will encounter different situations at every workplace. For example, my current
    employer recently switched over completely to InDesign, but there is still the
    odd old job, done in XPress, that we have to pick up and re-purpose, so it's good
    to know both programs. \r\n\r\nMy previous employers, on the other hand, favored
    QuarkXPress, and even then the younger art directors would comp their stuff in
    InDesign rather than XPress, so it made sense to know both programs. You never
    knew which one you would be using on a given day, or for a given job.\r\n\r\nWhat
    it boils down to, for me, is that XPress and InDesign are the best, and most-used,
    layout programs out there, and it pays to be familiar with both of them -- it
    makes you more valuable to potential employers. That's a good enough reason for
    me.\r\n\r\nI am going to avoid comparing pros and cons of the two programs, because
    some employers may have the latest version of InDesign but an older version of
    XPress, or viceversa. If you're lucky, they will have upgraded to the latest version
    of each.\r\n\r\nHoping this sheds some light,\r\nR.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I second what Ricardo said. You will be more well-rounded and employable if
    you are at least proficient in both programs. I was trained in Quark back around
    1990, when it was really the only game in town (far superior to Pagemaker) and
    have used InDesign for 2 or 3 years now. A lot of my clients still either prefer
    Quark or use it exclusively - it's still the lingua franca in book publishing.
    There is much to recommend about both programs. I'm not going to compare them,
    just to recommend you verse yourself in Quark.

  body: "i think what drives the need for both (quark and indesign) is what has already
    been mentioned... that you might be asked to revive a past project that originated
    in either and you will need to be savvy in both to be able to work on the document.\r\n\r\n(furthermore)
    publishing firms, printers, or other given service bureaus might require that
    files be delivered in one format or the other. so whether you are working \"in-house\"
    or for a creative firm, requirements for a print job are sometimes dictated to
    you by the printer.\r\n\r\n(lastly) if you are working for a creative firm, their
    clients sometimes dictate which application they want used. and if they love one
    versus the other... that is the one they are going to want ALL their documents/projects
    built in. and if the file changes hands back to the client, they will want to
    be able to open the document for future use, edits, etc.\r\n\r\nhope that shed
    some light...\r\n"

  body: I don't know how the latest version of Quark compares to earlier ones (and
    I mean real early, like v.3.3), but if it is as user friendly as I remember it,
    it should be a snap to pick it up.
