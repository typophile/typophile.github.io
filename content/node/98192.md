body: "Some people might know, most won't, but the website of the Rijksmuseum, the
  Netherlands had an overhaul. Most fancy about this is the overview of their archive,
  which includes a lot of high-resolution type and lettering material. It is a bit
  of a search, but there are some real gems to be found and is perfect for lazy browsing
  on a lazy sunday.\r\n\r\nNext to this, I wonder if some people might know of the
  origin of this type:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MINN_6560.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
  used by Johannes Ensched\xE9 around 1760 as a companion sheet to an etching.\r\n\r\nA
  link to the larger page:\r\nhttps://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-24.123/letters\r\n\r\nThe
  gallery is easy to browse and filtering is quite simple, which includes filtering
  on colors and techniques. The english version sadly doesn't translate the keywords,
  so that's a bit of a drawback.\r\n\r\nMuch can be found at:\r\nhttps://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search?f=1&p=1&ps=12&technique=boekdruk&imgonly=True\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search?f=1&p=1&ps=12&type=tekstblad&imgonly=True"

    about the connections between jewelry making and type designing.\r\n\r\nThis looks
    like a great resource, thanks for posting it arthus."

    by Ensched\xE9 from Mathias Rosart in 1768 and used for a few words on the title
    page of their type specimen from that year."

  body: "Thanks! I'll have a look what else I can find, might be something for a pet
    research project after I'm done with my current one. From what I've been able
    to look at, some should be in the Ensched\xE9 collection so that's only a busstop
    or 4 away, that is of course if I can arrange a visit ;)"

  body: Anybody have any idea how that site was put together code-wise?  It looks
    really nice.  Wordpress, perhaps?
