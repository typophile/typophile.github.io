body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI saw recently an article where footnotes were placed inside
  the text, after the paragraph in which they were referred to. So here it would be
  like this(1):\r\n\r\n(1) Here's the footnote.\r\n\r\nAnd here's the next paragraph
  of the text.\r\n\r\nI must admit it was a novelty for me, but also a sort of eureka
  moment. I'd like to ask you two things:\r\n1. What is this type of footnotes called?\r\n2.
  What are your opinions on this solution (in particular, in a scientific text)?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\ncaminoix"

    work.\r\n\r\n2. I suppose it's an acceptable arrangement if EVERY reader MUST
    read the footnote before proceeding but, if the information is not vital to understanding
    what follows it, I think most readers would find it intrusive and an impediment
    to the natural flow of the text."

  body: "1. Ah, ok, thanks.\r\n\r\n2. Well, I found it comfortable with this particular
    author, but you're right, it must depend on what the author actually uses footnotes
    for. It's a pity, because it means I can't use it in my own articles, as wherever
    I send them to, they will convert it to normal footnotes to keep the entire volume
    consistent.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you were the chief editor of a scientific journal,
    would you value consistency of the whole volume more than the authors' ideas on
    what their texts should look like? As long as the ideas aren't complete absurd,
    of course."
