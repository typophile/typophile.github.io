body: "We run OS 10.3.9 on an older Mac (family use). I\u2019ve installed various
  fonts via Fontbook.\r\n\u2013 In Mail, I can access all fonts.\r\n\u2013 In TextEdit,
  I see \"Baskerville\" only in the font\u2019s palette while the text gets rendered
  in some Helvetica (?).\r\nThe more odd, the proprietary Mac fonts palette appears
  differently in both applications:\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mac_fonts_6031.jpg]\r\n.\r\nDoes
  anyone have a clue to this?\r\nAny help is much appreciated."

  body: Not sure why you are only seeing Baskerville, but the palette's appearance
    depends on the size of the window. If you make it larger, the missing Collections
    column, effects sliders, etc. will appear. If there isn't enough room, some of
    the less essential interface elements are hidden.
