body: 'I have read that one of the alternatives, before digital, to printing book
  titles in roman (which I find ungainly) in an otherwise italic sentence was the
  use of backwards slanting italic. Whilst it is easy enough to turn normal italic
  into backwards or even upright italic in, say, InDesign, are there any digital text
  fonts that include specifically designed backwards italic? '

  body: "Backslanted italics are used in cartography, for example to write river names.\r\nOne
    of the better known example is http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kursivschrift/\r\nBut
    there also is the most expensive font on MyFonts: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jha/bodoni-ritalic/\r\n\r\nDigging
    a bit, you can find a few older threads on the subject."
