body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm having a bit of trouble with this one. I thought it was
  Bodoni 72, but the capital C has only one serif - not the usual lower and upper
  serifs.\r\nAnyone have any idea what it could be ?\r\nSorry about the low quality
  of the image - I have to work with a scan from the spine of the cover - so no hires
  images.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and effort :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni-ish_6233.jpg]"

  body: It's Times New Roman, Bold Condensed. (Possibly manually condensed). Not sure
    which version, the Monotype version Microsoft licenced has a marginally different,
    flatter U.
