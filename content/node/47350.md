body: "I have found some fonts very similar to this font attached. \"Chubu 08\" is
  very close to my font, but the \"N\" and \"A\" is incorrect. \"Megaton\" is even
  closer but the \"A\" is incorrect. The font is from a PC video game released in
  Europe, dunno if that helps.\r\n\r\nAlso I know the \"N\" is backwards so if the
  font can be found exactly like my attached image but with a proper \"N\" i would
  be much appreciated. If not well i'll have to use one of these alternate ones."
