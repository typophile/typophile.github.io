  body: "Dude, sorry. i'm not going to give out my real name. Just wondered what the
    fucking Citi font was so that I could complete this logo for my job. Trust me,
    just needed to know the Citi bank font.\r\n\r\nAnd um, for the record, Paul Hewson
    is a rather common name. I'm pretty sure (unless you hold the town's census),
    there could easily be one that lives there."

    you'd find that the identification of <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Interstate>Interstate</a>
    had already been determined.

  body: I'm sorry, why does everyone think I'm "phishing"? And I did do a google search.
    Couldn't find any help. I do appreciate your help auricfuzz. And to demented &
    sii, I'm sorry, as a graphic designer, I'd try to get some typography assistance
    from a website called Typophile. My bad.
