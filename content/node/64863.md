  body: "It's Artcraft. There are two versions available at MyFonts, and I think there
    are some differences (look at 'g'). The URW version's g has an ear that goes the
    wrong way, so get the Ascender version. Nick Curtis may also have a version, but
    by another name, which I can't recall.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
