body: Here at slow-to-upgrade corporation &#40;still using OS 9&#41; we are having
  discussions about our kerning options. We make an effort to improve the quality
  of fonts we use on large campaigns. In the past, we&#39;ve used Quark kerning tables,
  but we have moved to doing most of our kerning in Fontographer. <BR> <BR>For those
  who use Quark kerning tables, do you have a system for storing and upgrading these
  tables? Do you create kern tables before using a font or do you capture and upgrade
  the tables as the font gets used? Any tips or hints would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>For
  those who use Fontographer to kern, what kind of system do you use? Do you set a
  limit to how many kern pairs you&#39;ll allow? Any tips? <BR> <BR>And for the future,
  what are the odds that this kerning information will be useful and or translatable
  to OpenType fonts or to InDesign? <BR> <BR>Thanks for your input! <BR> <BR> <BR>

    you may as well do it properly - ditch the kerning, respace the font for your
    proposed usage, &#42;then&#42; kern the font. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d avoid using Quark
    kerning tables: they&#39;re only 200 units per em, are not easily imported to
    a font editor &#40;you&#39;re going to have to massage them to fit the em digitization
    of the font&#41; and of course they are non-portable between other apps. <BR>
    <BR>If the kerning is in the font then you shouldn&#39;t have any issues saving
    it out of a suitable editor as OpenType, and or using it as Type 1 or OpenType
    in InDesign.'

  body: Yes, you should re-kern &#40;and possibly totally re-space&#41; the fonts
    themselves. <BR>Feel free to contact me for pricing! :-&#41; <a href="mailto:hrant@inverselogic.com">hrant@inverselogic.com</a>

    <BR>Ha. Try working for the phone company. Just this week we upgraded from 8.6
    to 9.2. I had to get a special dispensation to upgrade before anyone else so I
    could use InDesign 2.0. <BR> <BR>Jay'

  body: Neo and Hrant, I definitely agree on re-spacing fonts! <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love
    it if folks would explain the sort of guidelines they use when they kern fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>Do you use Fontographer, FontLab, something else? <BR> <BR>Do you kern every
    character combination, including numbers, punctuation etc.? Is there a reason
    why you would and would not do that? <BR> <BR>How do you differentiate the kerned
    fonts from the original fonts? <BR> <BR>Hrant, you make a joke about pricing,
    but please explain further. Is it just too expensive and or time consuming to
    kern an entire font? <BR> <BR>Also, since there have got to be other nutcases
    .... er, I mean &#34;artists&#34; ... out there who kern the heck out of their
    fonts, is there any effort  to share this information with one another? Would
    that be ethical? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m very curious to hear your responses. <BR> <BR>

  body: '1&#41; Although I tend to place more value on &#34;deep&#34; kerning than
    most people, I do agree with the conventional feeling that base spacing is very
    important. Not just for users sans access to the font&#39;s kerning value &#40;due
    to SW&#41;, but also because it makes kerning easier. Many fonts needs re-spacing
    more than re-kerning. <BR>2&#41; Kerning everything is not done because it&#39;s
    not worth it, and it bogs down the OS font engine. I use two kinds of data: linguistically
    frequent pairs &#40;and words&#41;, and rare but highly problematic pairs. Spacing/kerning
    is actually a very pragmatic process, even though it&#39;s really mostly technical.
    <BR>3&#41; Differentiation: A good method is to use a name that starts with 3
    or 4 of the same letters as the original, preferably alphabetically right afterwards.
    <BR>4&#41; Sharing: some people would call it &#34;unprofessional&#34;, but to
    me <i>not</i> sharing &#40;at least to a reasonable extent&#41; is unethical.
    <BR> <BR>Pricing: no joke! I can do the job, for a reasonable fee. <BR> <BR>hhp

    this then you can take responsibility for it, but other&#39;s may not really understand
    the process and consequences&#41;.'
