body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI am working on a brand identity and struggling to find a suitable
  complimentary type family to use across all branded material. The logo type I am
  working on is a modified version of Optima Nova Bold Italic (please see pic for
  reference).\r\n\r\nIdeally I want the identity to have a fresh, clean feel ( please
  see example pic for the kind of vision I am aiming for ) It would be nice for the
  type family to compliment some of the aspects of the modified Optima font.\r\n\r\nThe
  company sectors need to be added under the main logotype and everything I have tried
  so far doesn't cut the mustard....\r\n\r\nIt would be great to hear your suggestions
  and views\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\nSimon"
