  body: Alice sent me this recently and I told her I didn&#39;t recognize it, and
    thought it might be engraving or film type used by a stationer. It&#39;s the main
    thing they can offer that we can&#39;t all reproduce by buying the font. <BR>&#40;This
    was the image she sent me&#41; <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23630.jpg"

  body: Mike, if you don&#39;t recognize it, I&#39;m not sure any of us has any hope
    in doing so! <BR> <BR>I&#39;d check the wedding-invitation catalogue that was
    sent to me in the mail -- now that I&#39;m caught up in the wheels of the bridal
    industry -- but I threw it out in disgust. I&#39;ll be designing ours, thankyouverymuch
    -- now if I could only find the right typeface...

  body: Looking at it again, and checking some other books, I think it looks a fair
    amount like Zoom Script &#40;Solotype&#41;. Jason Walcott did this one for Jukebox
    as &#34;Opulence&#34;. The sample is from my Script guide. You can get it from
    Veer.com <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23636.gif"

  body: Whoops, wrong &#39;r&#39; and wrong &#39;S&#39;. If it&#39;s one of the similar
    Z-series Solotype Scripts, it means it&#39;s probably only got a small chance
    of being digitized. I guess I really didn&#39;t know what it was. <BR> <BR>Sorry.
    Still I think this is quite close.
