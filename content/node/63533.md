body: "I'm looking for a quick font suggestion for a project I'm doing a layout for.
  The project is both musically and visually a collaboration between several talented
  emerging artists. The packaging includes very beautiful photographic illustrations,
  and the music is a mix of djs working with some Tibetan influenced vocals. Contrary
  to how it may sound, this is not a new agey piece at all - the sound of this music
  is edgy and underground, but also beautiful and easy to listen to. This seems like
  a lot to fit into a font.\r\n\r\nOF COURSE because the project is completely artist
  funded, it has a very small budget.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that several types of fonts
  could work, but I haven't found the right one yet. What I'm looking for is something
  that is either very ornate and elegant, or something sort of timeless and classic,
  or something with a modern edge or clean gallery feel to it. Any of these things
  could work so long as the font suggests high end art.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions
  are totally appreciated! \r\nThanks!"

  body: 'Thanks for the leads AS & MM... Frank, the project is already over budg.
    I''m involved in this one purely out of love for this collaborative, so saving
    money everywhere possible is fairly key. Sometimes I wonder why it''s so hard
    to convince people that you get what you pay for in the land of fonts - but as
    you know even some clients that can appreciate this fact, just do not have a decent
    budget to work with. '

  body: "What are you designing? Record sleeves? Are you looking for display fonts,
    or text fonts? \r\n\r\nYour question is very broad. \u201COrnate and elegant\u201D
    could be a script, but I\u2019m not sure if that would fit your project. There
    are some very dramatic contemporary script fonts available quite cheap.\r\n\r\n\u201CModern
    edge, timeless and classic\u201D makes me think of a neutral sans serif of some
    kind, perhaps two dramatically different weights for contrast. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    just what first popped into my head. Could you fill us in on what exactly you\u2019re
    intending to use it for, and who your audience is? Also: have the client used
    any other typefaces before?"

  body: "This is basically a re-design of a layout first done by an illustrator who
    was not concentrating on the actual layout of the piece as much as the illustration.
    The pieces I have been given will evolve into a record sleeve. The style of the
    overall piece is quite eclectic. This musician is essentially collaborating with
    a variety of electronic musicians of differing styles. \r\n\r\nThe illustrations
    are somewhat ethereal, and have a bit of a timeless quality b/c they are embellishments
    added to the top of (for lack of a better description) very beautiful high fashion
    photographs.\r\n\r\nI left the style specifics of my question rather broad on
    purpose b/c I am starting from zero and can imagine several different combinations
    working. I will need a print font for both the title and the musicians name, as
    well as (if not the same)fonts for all of the internal copy text, or secondary
    information. Right now I am spending a significant amount of time simply looking
    for possible title/name heading fonts. As to neutral sans serif combos, the best
    mock up I've done on that front used bauhaus, which seems viable. Though I have
    been looking, I haven't found any elegant script or anything deocrational or ornate
    that is working yet.\r\n\r\nThe audience for this piece will vary. A broad description
    would be: the spiritual side to dj culture/underground art. There are no pre-existing
    font uses for the client to consider. Though most of the supporting artists involved
    in this project have previous releases, this will be the first release of the
    headlining artist - so we are creating that image now. I would say that it is
    as important that my final choices come across as 'fresh' or 'modern' as they
    do 'seasoned' because while the beats are very edgy, the vocals are based on ancient
    mantras.\r\n\r\nThank you ahead for any thoughts. I checked out your website ff,
    and enjoyed your work quite a bit."

  body: "Thank you, Flash! (Do you have a real name?) \r\n\r\nIf the illustrations
    are very busy I\u2019d consider a neutral sans. An alternative that is both classic,
    timeless and has a modern edge is <a href=\"http://new.typographica.org/2008/typeface-reviews/graphik/\">Graphik</a>!
    You\u2019ll have to contact Commercial Type for pricing. Graphik has the qualities
    to work both as a display face and as a text face. \r\n\r\nShameless promotion:
    <a href=\"http://www.frodehelland.com/prosjekter/skrift/noir-example.jpg\">Noir</a>
    is rather ornate, while still clean."
