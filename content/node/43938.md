  up with a theme. Mine are Romeo and Juliet, Palm Beach, and Xanadu. My theme is
  facade. I'm having a hard time with Xanadu, so I thought I might get some feedback.
  Thank you for your time. I'm completely open so fire away.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDesi"

    so fill us in on what the concept of the play is and we can help you from there.\r\n\r\nP.S.
    Don't remove the cross bars on uppercase <em>A</em>'s. I have seen it countless
    times; it draws to much attention to itself and is overdone.  "

  body: thanks on the A tip. Xanadu is about the muse, Clio, that comes to earth to
    inspire this guy to open a roller disco in Venice Beach, CA.

    break things up the design.\r\n\r\nIf I was going to do Xanadu I would probably
    do some research into disco-era nightclub flyers. If thats especially hard to
    find (which seems likely) sifting through record covers from the period seems
    like another good idea."

    too busy and I wanted to make it slightly more modern with a greek twist, but
    I haven't been very successful so far. Thanks for the advice.\r\n"

  body: "I would suggest you look up the Pan-Pacific Auditorium. It's where parts
    of Xanadu were filmed. The deco update is something to reference thematically.\r\n\r\nAnd
    listen to the song Dancin:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEOFvBdD2k\r\n\r\nThe
    periods which are referenced musically are at the heart of the Xanadu idea. Big
    Band meets Rock Band. The grandiosity, and fun, and over the top(-ness) never
    dies.\r\n\r\nThe film and sound quality is crap, but the song is great!\r\n\r\nHave
    fun!"
