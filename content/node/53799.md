  from 1930, and came across a peculiar attempt at merging [[cyrillic]] with a [[blackletter]]
  aesthetic. I don't think the idea ever really caught on, as I can't remember any
  examples prior to the 90's (and no successful ones since)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cyrgoth_5450.png]\r\n\r\nStill,
  I wonder if this might be useful to someone attempting one."

    letter on some shop fronts when I was in St. Petersburg in the fall.

  body: "Before the revolution of 1917 many Russian foundries carried both Latin and
    Cyrillic blackletter. Obviously, there was a demand for those types. I remember
    contributing a couple of samples to the <a href=\"http://www.cooper.edu/art/lubalin/bletter.html\">exhibit</a>
    Peter Bain and Paul Shaw put together in 1997. The fashion for blackletter in
    Russia started in the first third of the 19th century. Interestingly, the title
    page (or was that the cover?) of the first edition of Gogol\u2019s <em>Dead Souls</em>\u2014designed
    by Gogol himself\u2014featured blackletter (the words <em>\u041D. \u0413\u043E\u0433\u043E\u043B\u044F</em>):[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1842_Dead_Souls_4530.jpg]\r\n\r\nBlackletter
    was shown in many Russian lettering manuals as late as in the 1920s and 1930s
    (what Ivan has found is not a type specimen but a lettering guide). Obviously,
    the demand for Cyrillic blackletter is still there. There are some fonts available
    for downloading on-line, all of them of questionable quality. Some attempts at
    Cyrillic blackletter, hand-drawn or hand-written, can be found in the books of
    Villu Toots."

    the typeface isn''t "copy paste", which is mostly the case with other Cyrillic
