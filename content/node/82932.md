  old Statoil logotype.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/statoil_5343.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  closest match I have found is Frutiger Bold, but I am not entirely sure.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?"

    Black is probably the closest match."

  body: Logos for corporations this large often used customized type or lettering.
    This logo likely began with Frutiger.
