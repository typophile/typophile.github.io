  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm working on a wordmark for a consulting firm that mostly does business with the government. Currently it's just ff Olsen with some minor alterations (rounded Corners, shortened ascender and took in the serifs a bit).

Let me know what you think. Is it too plain? awkward looking etc... I think I'm losing the forest for the trees on this one and need some feedback.

Thanks

		<div class="commentbody">Again, don't know much about the nature of the client, but:
If you're chopping off a half-serif from the "el" (which I like BTW) you might pull that off with the "y" too. I would also consider making everything (or maybe almost everything) flat - I'm thinking top/bottom of the "C", bottom of the "e", and/or bottom of the "y" (which might convey an air of stability befitting a government contractor).

As for the nature of the client; as a government contractor they really cover a broad spectrum of services, everything from elearning, web development, workforce development, training, performance consulting, etc...
so the look has to be flexible enough to work in a variety of environments.</div>

There's absolutely no need to get all serifs consistent across the words. It is not a wall of text, it's just a set of specific glyphs and while it's nice to have some consistency between them it is certainly not a requirement, nor even a priority. I think the version from 2:38 pm is really good, it matches your brief well, so I wouldn't over-think things and simply go with it. It is indeed very good.</div>

Hrant, Thanks for all your comments. 

I was pulled away from this job for a bit. I had time to look it over yesterday and made a couple of changes and would like to get your thoughts. 

I'm wondering if that space between the 'e' and 'y' is distracting. </div>

This is a quick sketch trying a bucket 'y', just wanted to get some opinions on it. 

thanks.</div>
