body: "TypographyShop is expanding its line into hoodies. We've just released [[http://typographyshop.com/helvetica-unisex-hoodie.html|Helvetica
  Neue Descending an Eco-Friendly Hoodie]] just in time for the holidays.  We wanted
  to find a very special hoodie and were happy to find this blend of organic cotton
  and recycled polyester.  The polyester started life as plastic bottles and even
  the dye used in the process is low impact.\r\n\r\nWe've got a new t-shirt up as
  well: [[http://typographyshop.com/letterpress_mens_t-shirt.html |Letterpress]].
  \ Set in Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk bold in reverse, a very simple homage to everyone's
  favorite printing process.  Or at least it seems like it these days. \r\n\r\nWe're
  also proud to have been part of the Typophile film fest in Portland a couple of
  months back.  We gave away 5 t-shirts to winners of a quiz preceding the films.
  Thanks to Zara from Typophile for all her help.\r\n\r\nIn other news, since our
  inception, TypographyShop has stated that a portion of all our sales would be donated
  to Design Education Programs. \r\n\r\nWe're pleased to announce that the AIGA Education
  Fund is the first recipient of our donations. The fund supports AIGA's education
  and scholarship programs which help students, usually from inner cities, who demonstrate
  talent and are willing to serve a social purpose as well as a personal goal. \r\n\r\nLearn
  more about the fund [[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/worldstudio-scholarship|here]].\r\n\r\nHappy
  Holidays\r\nPatrick King\r\nTypographyShop[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suhoodie_3799.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/letterpress_su_4918.jpg]"
