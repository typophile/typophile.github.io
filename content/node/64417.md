body: "Hello all,\r\n  I'm looking for any information folks might have about Les
  Usherwood, his career and his legacy. I'm currently a student at Humber College
  in their Graphic Design program and we've been asked to profile select Canadian
  designers, illustrators and art directors for what I'm told will go into the ADCC
  archives. If there's anyone on here who worked with Les, I'd be really interested
  in asking a few questions.\r\nThank you,\r\njr"

    in its Fall 1990 issue. If you can't find it in your library let me know.\r\n\r\nAnd
    to Ohlawdy:\r\n\r\nIs Carl Dair on the list? He should be easy."

    the biographies of designers? Wouldn't it be better to have the students spend
    their time studying the designers works, rather than their lives? Or, shudder,
    actually learning to design stuff?\r\n\r\n"
