  body: "I like it! It's modern, tredy, great color scheme, also! The front part is
    just a little hard to read. I'd suggest using Ss instead of Zs, like for ViSuals,
    though. You need to keep it professional.\r\n\r\n-- David"

    straight 'i' without the angle would work better.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
