  best place for this post. (If not, please let me know, and I'll keep it in mind
  for the future. ;-)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a calligraphic typeface that includes
  a lowercase \"e\" with a swash extending out from its midpoint. (Does that description
  make sense?) The kind that would generally only be used when the \"e\" is the last
  letter in a word or line. Searching through all the calligraphic typefaces on, say,
  myfonts.com is time-consuming and rather tedious, so I thought I'd see if anyone
  here has some good recommendations.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\u2014\r\nConnie"
