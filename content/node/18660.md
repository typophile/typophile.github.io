  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware the Foundry\u2019s typefaces are only
    available through the company itself. But nothing to worry about, they are very
    helpful and efficient and will certainly come back to you soon."

    before?

    of his earlier typeface, Quay Sans. The latter face is readily available from
    several sources/foundries, including:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/quay-sans/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=ITC.108281.0.0"

  body: I'll keep my fingers crossed they get back to me soon. "Foundry Journal" is
    what we're looking for, exactly that, nothing more, nothing less.

  body: "I enquired via their web form about pricing on Monoline today, and got a
    very full and helpful reply within three hours from Freda.\r\n\r\nA full price
    list was appended, the Journal family (via email, single-seat) is \xA3225.00 for
    Mac, and \xA3250.00 for PC, plus VAT (I suppose for UK customers only?), CD \xA310.00
    extra.\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty straight forward.\r\n\r\nRichard"
