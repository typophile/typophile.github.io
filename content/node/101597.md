    able to find any information with it. My feeling is it's either a custom typeface

    liked the SchoolText font. I found it for free download in http://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Uncategorized/29268/SchoolText\r\n\r\nbut
    from some reason the download file is corrupt, can anyone help me with that?\r\n\r\nthanks"

    It's apparently been bundled with other products such as ClarisWorks and (as such
    fonts often do) has made its way into the archives of some mass font repositories.
    I don't know of any legitimate source to download it, but it <em>is</em> part
    of the School Font Collection CD ([[http://www.halfhollowhills.k12.ny.us/uploaded/PDFs/Technology/sf.pdf|PDF
    link]]) which is available from several online vendors. http://goo.gl/zrghu"
