  the rest of the letters i would like to hear some critics about these letters i
  have already done."

    is--or at least seems to be--the same size as its upper half, what makes it look
    smaller, hence unstable. You should make the lower half bigger, and also make
    sure it's at least as wide as the upper half.\r\n\r\noribendor"

    I thought that the horizontal serifs of the f, g and t looked too thin. I streched
    them a bit. Is it right in this way or do u think it looks dumb!? \r\nAnd also

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nThe 'x' and 'g' are much better now.\r\n\r\nAs for the horizontal
    serifs of the 'f', 'g' and 't', their width is just fine, but I'm not sure about
    their height. Shouldn't you place them a little lower, so that their upper outline
    would be exactly the same height as the upper outline of the 'x'? I think you
    should.\r\n\r\nAnd is it really okay to call the horizontal stems of the 'f' and
    't' \"serifs\"? I doubt it... ;-)\r\n\r\noribendor"

  body: "Thanx for the lesson in type anatomy. I'm new into type etc. but i also was
    a bit unsure if it is correct to call these things serifs.\r\n\r\nI also have
    a question about drawing curves in a letter. When I was transforming text into
    curves in Freehand I noticed that the most curves have much more bezierpoints
    than I used in my letters. For example I tried to draw the Arial f. A curve in
    the original letter has got 3 or more points. I would draw the same curve with
    just 1 point!? Should I try to use more points!? Why it is important to make more
    points, even if the letters look like the same!? I take notice that it is much
    more difficult to draw a curve with more than 1 ponit!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://lastraw.de/Steven/ff.gif\">Arial

  body: "The ideal is always to use minimal number of Bezier points needed, both for
    economic reasons (the font file becomes smaller) and visual reasons (simpler curves
    tend to look \"smoother\"). I guess the reason why Freehand showed more Bezierpoints
    than necessary was that you used a True Type version of Arial, while in Freehand
    curves are described with the same polynomials as Type 1 fonts, not True Type.
    The extra points were probably added during the process of translating the latter
    into the former, but they're useless.\r\n\r\noribendor"

  body: I've got a few quick comments, but keep in mind I'm a novice type designer.
    The terminal of the "c" is a bit too long. Your "d" feels unbalanced to me. Looking
    at your "d" and "p", you need to make sure that you give your bowls enough space
    from your junction points. Notice how your curves go in nicely on your "m",  "n"
    and "h" and still give your stem some breathing room. That adds legibility to
    your face. Promising start, keep chuggin'.

  body: "Which terminal of the c do u mean!? The upper teardrop-terminal or the terminal
    at the bottom!?  I think I like them both. But if I change the teardrop do i have
    to change the teardrop in the same way at the a!? (because they are identically
    now) Or if I change the terminal at the bottom do I have to change the therminal
    at the e too!?\r\n"
