    \"get info\" on the folder and see if the folder is locked and/or if read and
    write is enabled. If you are on a PC, then I have no idea."

  body: Do you have administrative rights (i.e.you can install applications for all
    users of the system)? If so you can change read-only folders by doing "get info",
    go down to the permissions area, click the lock icon, enter your password in the
    prompt, and then change the permissions so your user account has *read and write*
    permissions. Then you should be able to delete it as normal.
