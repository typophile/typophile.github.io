  work as a link.\r\n\r\nThis is fairly self-explanatory. The client provided me with
  the scan of the image and copy. The printing specs are unknown so I\u2019m giving
  a generous margin all around. I\u2019m happy to find a chance to use Hypatia, but
  with so many characters I suspect there are probably a few things to be improved.
  I\u2019ve given a minimum adjustment to the kerning, and would love any direction
  in this regard as well as any general crit.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hatleyeditorialanddesign.com/poster.pdf\r\n\r\nSo
  the PDF link is not working so a jpeg.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TBPSTR3_6318.jpg]"

  body: "Nice to see Hypatia in use.\r\n\r\nYou've used it in 3 different ways. I
    wonder if you can unify that. You've got spaced with space around, not spaced
    with space around and spaced with only space above. I'd simplify that first."

  body: "That addresses one of my primary concerns\u2014that I\u2019ve fallen for
    the ST ligature when I should track out the true caps to match the small caps.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
    waffled on making the chamber music/chamber opera text part of a mask for the
    painting. I\u2019ll bring that up and away from the painting. I\u2019d like that
    whole statement to recede a bit more but a second lighter color gets too busy.\r\n\r\nThis
    is 11x17 finished size for reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TBPSTR4_4959.jpg]"

  body: "It is improved.\r\n\r\n- The top line has x-amount of space in between the
    letters. It appears that the line-spacing to the next line below is at least half-that.
    I would make it equal to or a bit more. As it is you are crowding the title.\r\n-
    I don't understand the point of the line \"Chamber Music\" space space space \"Chamber
    Opera\" -- Shouldn't there be an ampersand or something?\r\n- You've justified
    every other line differently. I'd choose centering or left-justification.\r\n-
    The diamond bullets seem random. You could add more line-spacing and simply remove
    those."

  body: "Thanks. All the caps are tracked at the same amount, but the small caps are
    probably designed with greater spacing. I\u2019m using an En space between the
    chamber music/opera statement. I check and see if I can add an ampersand.\r\n\r\nThe
    small text at the bottom and the chamber music/opera statement are centered. Everything
    else is flush left. I'll look at the bullets. They are characters in Warnock,
    but I'm not wed to them.\r\n\r\nLooks like we are going to a landscape format."

    a different sort. But I think you get the idea of where I was going.

  body: "I do. And thanks. One unfortunate detail is that I've been informed this
    is being printed at Kinkos so I'm leaving a .5\" border as a safe zone for insane
    printing and trimming that will be out of my control. I would love to bleed the
    image though.\r\n\r\nHypatia is such a sea of characters. In the title I added
    quite a bit of space between the I and B. That's the only kerning I really pushed
    and it didn't get flagged so that gives me some confidence.\r\n\r\nI also really
    feel like \"Tiburon Music Festival\" should work as one shape. And, I did pick
    up the alternate J in June that doesn't descend. The En dash is rather long, so
    it is interesting to see the hyphen between the dates. \r\n\r\nThe landscape version
    is rather dismal by comparison, but this whole project is really defined by the
    image. The client gave me a suggested 1.5 hours to knock it out. Also there is
    a mailer with longer text to accompany\u2014that's why the Warnock. I'll post
    up again if it gets more interesting, otherwise it is a fun exercise in pondering
    a new face."

  body: "Thanks Thomas!\r\n\r\nAs mentioned the poster is landscape now and the worse
    for it. The foldy brochure can bleed though so it is looking better (for a double-fold
    8.5x11 brochure). I\u2019ve switched to Whitman for the Serif and it seems to
    be playing nice but the SC OSF is not functioning with CS3 or the 10.4 OS or something.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    my thought of the SC tracking was that it is for aged eyes and typing URLs that
    are strung together can be a challenge. I\u2019ve tracked it like the other SC,
    but I\u2019ll have another look.\r\n\r\nGood luck with the Ital!"
