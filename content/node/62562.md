  looking at font samples before you make your purchase are cool. You can type in
  your line of text and each font in the search will come up with that copy. Checkout
  is steamlined. And, service for font updates comes in handy. But, not all fonts
  are available at MyFonts. So, I wanted to get other folks views about other vendors.
  Which vendors do they prefer and, most importantly, why? '

    but I prefer to support the designer without forcing him to pay a commission.

  body: "Don is our kind of guy :-)\r\nHopefully, clients have the patience to look
    beyond the big vendors and give the many small one-person shops a look. Getting
    a market presence is not quick and easy. Vendors like MyFonts are sort of an intermediary
    that takes a chunk of the pie yet returns a steady stream of type seekers. The
    tough part is getting your work to show up often enough on their home page or
    \"hot\" lists when you compete with thousands of others.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Thanks for supporting your local type foundry. Upside: Support the artist, not
    the middleman. Downsides: Uncertain service after the sale and almost no foundry
    sites have the cool font preview feature.\r\n\r\ndezoom: That points to one of
    the downsides to MyFonts, which is that they seem to have their favorites. These
    favorites seem to enjoy more front page billing. They are not necessarily my favorites.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The \"popular\" designers and font lists are generated by sales so it is
    kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy thing. The tough part is cracking in to the
    lists with lots of sales. Once you are in, it becomes easier because there are
    more people looking at your work.\r\n\r\nMany of the things on MyFonts popular
    lists appeal to font buying groups like scrap-bookers. They love clipart looking
    stuff and frames and borders--also, cartoony and folksy hand written looking stuff.
    \ To me, much of this sort of thing looks unappealing but I am not in that demographic.
    Remember that sales success does not equal quality design. It means finding a
    market niche and feeding it what it wants. As a designer, you have to decide if
    you are more interested in sales volume than fine quality work.  If you are a
    combination of very good and good at marketing, with a bit of luck, you might
    get both acclaim and wealth.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I try to license type directly from the foundry whenever they have their own
    online shop. Even if it involves PayPal (like Sumner Stone's) or me calling my
    credit card company to tell them to authorize an online purchase in the Netherlands
    (like I had to for a recent Typotheque purchase). Otherwise, I typically use MyFonts,
    but have nothing against using any other resellers if I can't license fonts directly
    from the foundry.
