    using the logo separately from the mark. '

  body: "I am not sure where you are gonna use this logotype design, is it an agency
    logo design? I prefer the one on the top right with color combination of orange,
    cyan, light cocoa. it looks brighter and more attractive from a far distance.\r\n\r\ngood
    work!\r\n\r\n\r\nChriswong"

  body: "I like the one on the top right, too, but, it reads \"hit\" to me. \"Hit
    Design\" really isn't that bad a name, though! I kinda like it. \r\n\r\nI also
    think maybe it's stronger without the brown frame?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ht3_4420.jpg]"

  body: "Agreed. I like the colors and arrangement of the top right.\r\n\r\nBut like
    Eileen said I see hit. Even the the way the t seems to hit the h. It kind of works.
    Happy accident."
