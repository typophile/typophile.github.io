body: so here's my dilema..I am a graphic design student and have been given a project
  to create a type specimen book and I need a theme. My typeface I've been assigned
  is [[Century Old Style]]. Does anybody have any information or examples of where
  Century Old Style has been used? Any information you could help me with would me
  awesome. Thanks
