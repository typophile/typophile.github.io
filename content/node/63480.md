body: "This is the logo for SD26, a new restaurant designed by Massimo Vignelli, and
  I'm guessing he did the visual identity also. (Their site is www.sd26ny.com)\r\nI
  really like this typeface... it seems like Didot with better numerals.\r\nThe closest
  thing I could find to this typeface is Viola.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/viola-bq/\r\nBut
  that's not exactly right... the bottom right curve of the 2 is different.\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/SD26_4472.jpg]"

    is one of them, but this doesn\u2019t look like any Bodoni I know. Perhaps he
    has strayed from his philosophy."

  body: I couldn't confirm this yesterday because the Veer site was out of commission
    but it's pretty close to <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000116">Eloquent</a>
    from Jukebox... but not exact.

    similar feel as well with a heavier weight.
