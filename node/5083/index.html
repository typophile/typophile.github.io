		<div class="commentbody">&#62; i just thought it would be fun <BR> <BR>My own apportionment of illegal activity leaves no room for graffiti at the moment, sorry.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; lets not get too theoratical. <BR> <BR>? <BR> <BR>&#62; give me an example of a rule in graffiti. <BR> <BR>How should I know? But that doesn&#39;t mean I can believe there are none. For example, isn&#39;t &#34;coding&#34; broad a rule? Sure, it can be broken, but that&#39;s true in any field. Then there&#39;s the stylistic rules mentioned. <BR> <BR>&#62; were do you think graffiti and typography DO overlap?  <BR> <BR>A nice theoretical question.  :-&#41; <BR>They overlap at the level of individual black forms. But typography is different because of its abstraction - like &#34;default&#34; spacing; while lettering is different because of its contextualization - like doing something special when you have an &#34;LA&#34; sequence &#40;although increasingly typography is engulfing this&#41;. And what lettering and calligraphy share &#40;which typography doesn&#39;t have&#41; is that the forms are &#34;heuristic&#34;, not predetermined&#42;. Calligraphy and typography share very little. And there&#39;s something else: of the three, only typography can be truly immersive, the other two are essentially display-centric &#40;although in some instances -like a well-penned manuscript- it&#39;s hard to see that&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; &#34;Random&#34; fonts are deceptive - because of what Johnny von Neumann said. <BR> <BR>&#62; do you think a typographer can become better in typography after seeing graffiti? and vice versa?  <BR> <BR>Yes. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">But Hrant, all early tyeface designs were based upon calligraphy. I&#39;ve heard some historians claim that all type had origins in calligraphic forms well up until Bodoni really abstracted the forms toward a new direction of what design has become with the early moderns. Garamond is obviously based upon calligraphic forms. Transitional faces became more intelectualized maybe but the forms still have root in the way one writes a Latin majuscle and all italics of this period are based in humnist miniscule. Surely you can&#39;t deny a link, even if we have ventured farther from it as time has gone on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not only is calligraphy &#40;better: &#34;chirography&#34;&#41; at the source of virtually all historic type designs, it&#39;s still the largest &#34;school of thought&#34; in contemporary type design! I&#39;m certainly not denying its relevance &#40;and usefulness in terms of formal analysis&#41;, but I do think that in the realm of theory the actual overlap is minimal. Gutenberg for example imitated scribes in order to &#34;trick&#34; readers into buying his stuff.

I thought you were starting to see the value in graffiti. Selfish is bad art for sure, but all art starts with a personal interprative starting point, even design, even typography. No matter your opinion on Carson, he champions an important idea- Legibility does not equal communication. <BR> <BR>My wife is an actress, and one of the similiarities I find between our training and our professions is that we are both communicators. For sure, the audience must be able to understand our message, but to move your audience as an actor is more than just speaking loudly and clearly, I feel the same for my work as a designer. The appropriate choice of type within a given project is like an actor being able to convincingly speak in a given accent. It can add great depth to the audiences&#39; perception of the content, or it can ruin it. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; you have to study what people have done  <BR>before and you can</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I am sorry to disappoint you. But I wasn&#39;t leading you on or anything. <BR> <BR>I just think that most people benefit more when a person uses his abilities to improve communication between others &#40;like in typography&#41; than when he merely shares his personal expressions &#40;like painting his name on a wall&#41;. But if a graffiti artist lends his skills to expressing some important social commentary, then I personally think that&#39;s great. <BR> <BR>Now, I do believe that Art is an integral part of life, and no human can or should try to supress his expression, but when that becomes the <i>objective</i>, the world gains very little. It&#39;s wasteful. On the other hand, people have different natures, and you can&#39;t force somebody to be very useful to many other people, at least not without making him miserable - and misery is contagious. <BR> <BR>&#62; Legibility does not equal communication.  <BR> <BR>Of course. But ignoring legibility is anti-design. Carson for example is an artist. I think the world needs more &#34;servants&#34; now, not more looking in the mirror. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;the funny thing, nick, is that ive met some writers who think alot like you. they belive that graffiti should be legible all the time. <BR> <BR>Itay, if they think that graffiti should be legible at all times, they are most definitely NOT thinkin glike me. <BR>I was merely pointing out that graffiti and typography are very very different. <BR> <BR>Remember you started the thread with: <BR>&#62;i think graffiti is a peak in typography and caligraphy&#39;s history.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just saying that graffiti has nothing to do with typography, and to claim that it is a wonderful part of typography is absurd. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite of typography! <BR> <BR>As many people have pointed out in the thread &#40;Alessandro most  eloquently&#41; they are differsnt -- graffiti is more like WORDMARKS and LOGOs. <BR> <BR>Typographic design is about a system of glyphs that can be combined in different sequences. <BR> <BR>Calligraphy has this in common with type: both used for long text.  <BR> <BR>You would be more accurate to claim that graffiti is a peak in PAINTING&#39;s history -- it&#39;s more Jackson Pollock than Matthew Carter. <BR> <BR>However, I can imagine that in the future, digital type could enable more fluid, bio-mimetic forms of expression which would bring it closer to graffiti, and allow for that influence.  <BR> <BR>For instance, Frank Jonen&#39;s type with &#34;bit depth&#34;, enabling the tonal variety of calligraphy, fused with some kind of LettError datastream-driven Knuth meta-font, could better capture the vitality of graffiti, which is presently killed by the media at the typographer&#39;s disposal.</div>

I love graffiti. But I actually find that it loses a lot of character when its all spruced up for a publicly sanctioned project. There are a lot of those in DC. And while quite wonderful, I always imagine the artists just trying to get it over with... Sort of like when a band such as Green Day puts out a record that is supposed to be &#34;punk&#34;, but it sounds too good to be anywhere near the vicinity of punk. Let alone the fact that their records are deemed &#34;appropriate&#34; or &#34;acceptable&#34;. Well, I suppose one could say it&#39;s not really graffiti anymore when it&#39;s commissioned... <BR> <BR>Anybody know the origin of the word &#34;graffiti&#34; ?</div>
