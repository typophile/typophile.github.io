  body: 'its looks like modified bauhaus, most of it anyway.  the &#34;q&#34; is just
    a custom job, as is the L.  the dots are missing on the I&#39;s, and the S and
    K look like they are just in century gothic.  actually, i know its not century
    gothic, but its a start until someone gets the real ID for the S and K.  heres

  body: I think they probably started from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bauhaus/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=L+i+q+u+i+d+++S+k+y"
    target="_blank">ITC Bauhaus Medium</a>. Not sure where the S and k came from.
