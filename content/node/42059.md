  from Carole King's landmark album [[http://images.barnesandnoble.com/images/9180000/9189509.jpg]].
  \r\nDoubtful that it's actually a typeface, more like hand drawn piece of art. But,
  I have to ask... \r\n\r\nAnybody out there know of a font that's even remotely close?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any replies!\r\nDr. Theopolis"

    search on myfonts.com for \"nouveau\" will turn up some similar fonts, many from
