body: "I'm working on a logo for a federal consulting company, who is moving into
  more software development and need a modern, solid logo. The more I tried creating
  a symbol the more I realized they only need a wordmark.\r\n\r\nI've played with
  some ideas and have found two faces that I think I can work from. Looking over the
  attached image do you feel that either of these faces will work. Which ones do you
  prefer. Can you think of similar typefaces I may want to checkout, or any other
  comments are all welcome\r\n\r\nI am at square one.\r\n\r\nThings I'm thinking right
  now: \r\n1,2,4,5 need to be thinned out slightly\r\nI need to work on kerning.\r\nI
  think most of the cuts in the L look a bit silly.\r\n\r\n"

    in between 1 and 5... the L with a smaller curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------:\r\nJean

    distracting to my eye. The descender, by comparison, looks stunted and withering. '

    but I'm not sure how to approach the bowl of the y.\r\n\r\nany suggestions...
    i.e. change the angle etc...\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: I've modified it slightly. I still think it should be thinner and maybe more
    angular. Any thoughts are appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogoChoice_6065.gif]

  body: something about those "E's" seems off, but i'm definitely into the reduced
    curve on the "L".

- body: "The y looks better, but not quite balanced yet. The axis needs to be higher,
    maybe?\r\n\r\nOverall, to my eye, balance is a problem. The width of the c, o
    and e are all too different to work together. The e looks like the nose was pulled
    out like taffy. The c feels like it was sliced off in a paper cutter, and it's
    optically a bit taller than the o.\r\n\r\nI do like the shapely l, and personally,
    I'd try that effect elsewhere in the mark for unity. I'd also use just black and
    white while designing, but maybe that's just me."
