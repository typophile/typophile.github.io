  body: "And then you try to negotiate with someone who've been exposed to this log-o-tron.\r\n\r\n<strong>A
    typical conversation:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Them:</strong> So, you are a designer..is
    that like, you work with computers and stuff?\r\n<strong>Me:</strong> Well I do,
    but it's just a small fraction of it, a computer is just a tool..\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    Year, right, so, what is it that you do? A Designer of what?\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    Well, what you see around you, posters billboards, books, signage, packages..websites
    (on rare occasions)\r\n<strong>Them:</strong> Ah ! So you are a webdesigner!\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    Well not so much, I dabble on occasion but..\r\n<strong>Them:</strong> Hey, you
    know what, my daughter needs a logo for her band, I still have a few minutes before
    I have to head back, can you make one for her before I leave?\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    Well, see now, designing a logo takes a lot of effort, and it's not just a mark,
    what we do is create identity systems..\r\n<strong>Them:</strong> Don't be ridiculous,
    I see logos every day, they are tiny things, you can make a dozen in five minutes.
    I'd do it myself, but I can't draw, tell you what, just draw me a picture and
    I'll put in the text and everything, My cousin showed me how to do shadows and
    other cool things in Photoshop!\r\n<strong>Me:</strong> Identity design is probably
    the most difficult discipline within the field of graphic design, it requires
    one to sift through countless concepts to arrive at a finished, concise form that
    embodies a whole score of ideas, is unique, and pleasing to the eye. You have
    to appeal to the target, and after all, a logo is just a tip of the iceberg. A
    logo by itself is just a mark, what makes it magic, is an expansive and detailed
    identity system, that establishes a particular style to all areas of visual communication,
    from architecture to the color of your toilet paper.\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    Well, thats just a load of corporate nonsense isn't it? It's just a way for you
    guys to raise your price. All I need is a simple little logo. I don't even mind
    if it only has two colors, and I can add the shadow myself. I was going to order
    it from one of those online logo places, but they are charging $50! Isn't that
    ridiculous? 50 bucks for a tiny picture. Who'd ever pay that? If you want payment,
    I can give you this gift certificate for $35 at Quick-E-Mart. How about that?\r\n\r\n<strong>And
    then you accept their commission, because they are distant friends of your relatives
    and you can't say no, or for that matter, ask for a fair price:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    Here are three directions that we can take to develop your identity.\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    Oou! It looks pretty good, but I don't like the green.\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    The green is there to blah-blah-blah... but it doesn't matter. What we have to
    decide, is which of the three do we pick and work on further.\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    Oh, I think the left one is the best of the bunch, but I thought about it some
    more this past week, and I think we should have strawberries. I've asked my friends
    and my partner, they all agree, that strawberries are a good positive image.\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    Eh?\r\n<strong>Them:</strong> And here is a font that I fond on the web, it's
    modern and forward-looking.\r\n<strong>Me:</strong> But..\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    So, if you could just take that design on the left, put a strawberry on top, and
    write the text in ZZ_Type_Kool, we'll be golden.\r\n<strong>Me:</strong> Hang
    on a minute... /Writes up a 2-page essay explaining the value of quality design,
    the difference between kitsch and avantgard, the meaning of professionalism and
    the role of a designer as conceptual communicator./\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    /After skipping through to the least sentence in the essay/ Stop being difficult!
    I am paying you money, and should be entitled to get what I ask. I even found
    you the font (ZZ_Type_Kool) so you don't even have to search for one. My insurance
    company needs a pink strawberry on top of a shining golden spear, and I expect
    to get it. If $100 I paid is not enough, I can add 20 more for your troubles.\r\n<strong>Me:</strong>
    So why do you even need a designer?\r\n<strong>Them:</strong> I can't draw strawberries.
    Look, I've worked with other designers before, and it was always very easy, I
    tell them what I want, they do it and get paid. See what they did for me? /shows
    a juggernaut of piss and glitter/\r\n<strong>Me:</strong> But that's horrible!\r\n<strong>Them:</strong>
    All designers say that about the work of all other designers! And it only cost
    me $50. \r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal Art and
