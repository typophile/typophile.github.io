body: I am designing a 16 page cd booklet and looking for a paper stock that has an
  uncoated look but keeps the ink on top for vibrant results. Any suggestions? <BR>
  <BR>I like the paper used in the &#34;feature&#34; section of Metropolis magazine.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for any suggestions, <BR>Tommy

  body: Check out French&#39;s smart white. It&#39;s uncoated and holds color very
    well. You might wanna check with the cd manufacturer though, they usually have
    hand packing fees for inserts with uncoated paper.

  body: Tommy, <BR>You should talk to a paper representative for your area or the
    printer that will be handling the print job. They will be more than happy to advise
    you and supply you with sample paper stock.Get the job quoted on by a few printers
    to get the best price. <BR> <BR>Kosmo

  body: Thanks for the posts. Right now I am not sure who the manufacturer is going
    to be--here or the UK. The concerns I have are finish, weight and will the final
    booklet fit in the jewel case. Most of the booklets I design are 8 panels and
    paper weight is not an issue. I will check out my french swatches and call some
    reps this week.

  body: Thanks for all the stock tips. Maybe I should have worded my question better.
    My main concern is will it fit a jewel case. I spoke with a rep from Unisource
    and they are going to make me a dummy using 100 lb txt. None of the reps seemed
    to know what weigths were within the requirements for a 16 page booklet in a standard
    jewel case.
