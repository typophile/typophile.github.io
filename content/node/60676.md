  this font. I uploaded the image to 'WhatTheFont' and posted to the WTF Forum without
  any luck. The Temsamani site appears to be from Vienna, Austria so I have a gut
  feeling the font may be from a foundry in Europe.\r\n\r\nAny help with an ID very
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/temsanami_4259.jpeg]"

    something very similar to this.

    to my own <a href=\"http://www.type.co.uk/a_to_z_listing/id/32553\">Houschka Pro</a>
    Bold and DemiBold with some characters from style set 2 and a bit of tweaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "Thanks so much Nick... You nailed it!\r\n\r\nI searched through the G-Type
    collection and felt Houschka was close but mistakenly thought the A, M, N and
    R in the logotype were standard characters. I've learned a good lesson today.
    With all the extra glyphs in the Pro versions (Houschka Pro has 853 - Wow!) it
    certainly makes font ID of logotypes a bit tricky when designers replace standard
    characters with a glyph or slightly modify others.\r\n\r\nKeep up the great work."

    R. And I think your R, Nick, is a better solution.

    that this doesn't appear to be 'Houschka Pro'. They use this all over their website

    snip ------------\r\nWe are very happy to learn that you like the typeface of
    our client's logo. Unfortunately the typeface which you are interested in is currently
    not available, as it is a corporate typeface created for the branding of Temsamani
    Couture. But the typeface might get released through http://www.ydt-fonts.com
    in the near future.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nYvonne Diedrich\r\n---------- snip
