  body: I like hummingbirds, and I like wood, but I don&#39;t see the connection.
    Do they already have a  <BR>hummingbird in their logo that you are preserving?
    <BR> <BR>Also, you&#39;ll get alot more useful suggestions from the folks here
    if you tell a little about the company.  <BR>For instance, does Woodnet serve
    wood suppliers or buyers? Raw materials like lumber or finished <BR> woodworking
    pieces?  <BR> <BR>The dn ligature looks a little more like dh.  <BR> <BR>Not sure
    about the font. It doesn&#39;t feel very &#34;woody&#34; to me.
