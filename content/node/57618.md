  in one of my typeface (I made).\r\nThe person sent me a table with the OTF numbers.\r\nAfter
  this I opened the font in FontLab\xAE and create the extra characters with the OTF
  number reference (see attachment).\r\n\r\nBut it seems that the person can't see
  those extra characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Question</b>:\r\n-----------------\r\nWhere/how
  can I create special character (at the CORRECT place, means that will works correctly)?\r\nThank
  you, have a nice day\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Dimitri\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on this site there is a page on language and script features. I can't seem to
    find it at the moment, but I'm sure someone here can help with that. If you generated
    it as a Postscript font instead of an OpenType font, then you have limited it
    to the first 256 characters(the ones with the yellow bands at the top).\r\n\r\nHopefully
    someone else will add some more useful information to this for you."

    an opentype (.OTF) file.\r\nBut what may be wrong, is <u>the way I made it</u>\u2026\r\n\r\nIf
    someone could help me?\r\nThank you, and have a nice day\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-

    You must actually assign these numbers as Unicode values for your glyphs. Then
    I believe they will work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u0401-prop_4784.png]\r\n\r\n"
