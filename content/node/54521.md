  to start a new one.\r\n\r\nThe Selectric Composer explanation is plausible, since
  it explains both the proportional spacing AND the general typewriter-sloppiness
  of the document.  See the extracted pdf page, attached, for a better example of
  the latter.  The nature of the document was such that it probably didn't rate professional
  typesetting but still something probably a bit better than a typewriter, though
  I can't say they did a very good job with it.  The type-twice method sounds painful....\r\n\r\nThanks,
  I learned something new today."

  body: '...except that it''s monospaced, whereas your mystery typewriter face is
    proportionally spaced. There were high-end typewriters back then that could do
    proportional spacing. The IBM Executive comes to mind. It''s probably one of those.
    I don''t think many of those faces have been digitized, if any. I''ve never seen
    one.'

  body: I would speculate, without having researched it further, that IBM could use
    the same fonts on both their mono-space and proportional-space machines.  I.e.
    maybe the same typeball with differing, machine-specific spacing mechanisms.

  body: Probably not. Part of the point of being able to do proportional spacing on
    a typewriter is not having to compromise the proportions of the letters by making
    them all the same width. The monospaced font you found shows such compromises
    (unnaturally wide i and l, unnaturally narrow M and W, for example) while the
    sample in your first post does not.

    however I had been search for a similar typeface for over two years and only discover
    what it was a couple of days ago.  While doing so I found character sets that
    identified the typeface ivandurakov posted as IBM Bold Face No.2 which was available
    on some models of IBM electric typewriter.  The following is a sample of the typeface:\r\n<img>http://munk.org/typecast/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IBM-1960-Catalog-22.jpg</img>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IBM-1960-Catalog-22_5583.jpg]"
