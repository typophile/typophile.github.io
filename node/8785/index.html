  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I made a font with liga, smcp, onum, pnum, and tnum. All very basic. I generated the font. I started laying out pages in InDesign to see if it was ready. Everything worked fine. But I thought the metrics weren&#39;t quite right so I adjusted them in the .vfb file, removed the .otf and regenerated the font. Many tries later &#40;including rewriting the features and rebuilding the classes&#41; I still can&#39;t get the features to work in Indesign. In fact, they are unavailable. What am I doing wrong?</div>

This sort of substitution I would not expect to behave in any way differently in the two app versions. <BR> <BR>In general, I am inclined to agree with Adam that, in this area of font functionality, if the font works correctly on one of the two computers, the problem probably lies outside the font. &#40;There are some other areas where I would not bet on this, like whether and how fonts appear in application menus, but that&#39;s another story.&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, and it&#39;s probably not necessary to &#34;contact Adobe&#34; seeing as I&#39;m here.

		<div class="commentbody">Wild thought -- long ago, there was a problem with &#34;font caching&#34;, wherein some RIP&#39;s would cache the font by the font&#39;s ID number. Strange things could happen . . . which led me to both rename all my fonts &#40;Bembo is B0500000&#41; AND to set the font ID number to &#34;0&#34; &#40;zero&#41; in Fontographer. This let Fontographer write off the font with the font ID number as a comment line. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t find a similar place to comment out the font ID number in FontLab 4.6.  <BR> <BR>Charles</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If your problem were at print time, that might have something to do with it. But it&#39;s on screen, right? No Adobe applications are using the UniqueID &#40;nor its successor, the XUID&#41; for any such purpose. <BR> <BR>Adobe itself no longer uses these, and omits them entirely in new fonts. You can just leave them blank in FontLab. They&#39;re in the first set of stuff under &#34;Version and Identification&#34; in the Font Info dialog. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas: <BR>My experience of the differences between InD2 and InDCS are that the latter is less prone to crashing, feels faster, and is more intuitive to use. My assumption is that the underlying technology is very different from that found in earlier versions, different enough that I would not be surprised if they share less than 50% of their code. At anyrate, the continued lack of backwards compatibility and adobe&#39;s failure to provide the promised plugin coupled with their recommended solution of using xml as the interchange format suggests that there are differences in how things are handled. Big ones. Additionally, InD2 has no problem with the font while InDCS does. What I&#39;ve heard is that InDCS bypasses most of the OS level font handling, though I don&#39;t know if this is only for Macs. <BR> <BR>Since I doubt someone such as yourself would have any desire to steal the unfinished font of a novice &#40;this goes for anyone on this board&#41; if you have InDCS handy and are willing to test the font at least then I will be certain that it is something specific to my machine.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The underlying technology in ID2 and IDCS is essentially the same. In areas that are present in both, the composition engine was revised, and plenty of bugs were fixed, and performance was improved, but the overwhelming majority of the code that was in ID2 continued into IDCS. <BR> <BR>Both versions bypass substantial aspects of the OS level font handling, though both rely on the OS for some of that &#40;like enumerating fonts installed at the system level, and on the Mac enumerating the primary script supported by the font&#41;. You might see more bypassing the OS in the future, as we continue to contend with OS-level bugs. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to continue to be pretty swamped this week, but if nobody else takes a look at it before then, I&#39;d be happy to look at your font next week. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Cool, with any luck I&#39;ll have figured it out for myself by then, but if not I&#39;d really appricate it. I&#39;m 99% certain it isn&#39;t the font, but I just reinstalled InDesign after wiping every trace of it from the registry as well as all files it left behind after the uninstall and none of the versions of the font work with it, but they all work on my old machine.</div>
