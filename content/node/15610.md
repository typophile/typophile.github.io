  Neue Helvetica was released as an updated version of [[Linotype]]'s [[Helvetica]].
  It includes more weights and styles, making the classic type family more consistant.\r\n\r\nHelvetica
  is still one of the most widley used typefaces of all time; although it is loved
  by many, it is hated by some. There is no shortage of commentary on the typeface,
  and there has even been a book published by [[Lars Muller Publishers]] entitled
  \"Helvetica: Homage to a Typeface\" dedicated to the famous type family.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype's website</a> includes an overview of
  all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/526/helvetica-family.html\">original
  Helvetica font</a> weights, and all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1266/neuehelvetica-family.html\">Neue
  Helvetica font</a> weights as well."
