body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am interested in finding fonts designed for subtitling, or fonts
  that are fine tuned to be suitable also for subtitles as a side product of the design
  process. Only a few days back I read about a recent font, a sans serif, that was
  designed for display, text <em>and</em> subtitles. But now I can't remember what
  it was!\r\n\r\nI figure that if somebody went through the trouble of designing something
  especially for subtitle use, then I should opt for that instead of something that
  just works ok on tv.\r\n\r\nThis might be a minor issue in the english speaking
  world - and many european countries that dub their films - but for example in Finland
  & Sweden it is quite relevant, since everything is subtitled. In Finland people
  are so used to reading subtitles (finns read the equivalent of 20 books a year from
  the screen), that they should easily be able to read pretty much anything. But now
  the most used font is helvetica. So there is room for graphic and type designers
  efforts there. Especially now, when technical issues will no longer limit the number
  of fonts available (from European Broadcasting Union's site):\r\n\r\n\"The EBU recommends
  the use of DVB Subtitling for new installations. This format allows broadcasters
  to determine the font (style & size), position and spacing \u2013 ensuring the same
  legibility on all compliant receivers. Special characters, scripts and icons are
  also supported without any concern for receiver legacy issues, supported character
  sets, etc.\"\r\n\r\nSo please, can you help me locate what could be the contemporary
  sans I saw and any other fonts that have been designed to work in subtitles. I do
  need a font to use quite urgently, but this list would be useful anyway, hopefully
  to others too.\r\n\r\nFor the first part of the quest, the font I saw was most likely
  designed in 2000-2007. I went through many of the contemporary font foundries often
  mentioned on this site. The font was recommended for magazine use, but subtitles
  were also listed in the description.\r\n\r\n\r\nI start the list with\r\n<a href=\"http://http://www.tiresias.org/fonts/index.htm\">Tiresias</a>
  (used by BBC)\r\n\r\n\r\n(I did go to Joe Clark's page, but couldn't find any named
  fonts.)"
