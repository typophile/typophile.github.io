  program for a global trade company (a lot of freight forwarding, logistics, etc.)
  Their word mark will be set in a combination of Gotham Bold and Gotham Light (all
  caps). \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a companion serif face for a descriptor line
  (tag line), and further identity (business stationery, brochures, related collateral?
  Perhaps a different sans for text?\r\n\r\nThank much.\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  body: It's such a quiet, unassuming sans it could really be compatible with anything.
    Rather than look for a pair to the typeface, you should look for a serif that
    fits the company's image and audience.
