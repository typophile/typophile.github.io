  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When I first became acquainted with type, &quot;Bodoni&quot; was considered to be the archetypal &quot;modern&quot; typeface. Later, I discovered that &quot;Didot&quot; might be a purer form of the genre. <BR> <BR>However, more recently I have taken an interest in the typical Modern face of the 19th century, which is quite different. This is the genre that appears to begin with the work of Miller and &quot;Scotch Roman&quot; in the early 19th century, and has later exemplars in the form of De Vinne, Modern 20, any number of &quot;Numbered&quot; moderns from the early 20th Century, and of course Monotype's Modern, and much later Torino. <BR> <BR>To me, this is a quite distinct genre, and very different from the neo-classical Moderns of Didot, Bodoni, and Walbaum. It is characterized by huge serifs (pot-hooks in the italic lower case that are almost cursive in effect), tiny aperture, and extreme stroke contrast. <BR> <BR>I have seen this kind of lettering on gravestones in England from back in the 18th century, so I assume that, as usual, the typefounders were playing catch-up. However, it seems to me from looking at specimens from Figgins, and Caslon from the 1830s, that the genre was precisely defined in type by then.  <BR> <BR>Can the definition of the style be attributed to any one designer, perhaps Richard Austin?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick <BR> <BR>I think probably so but perhaps not definitively. Based on type specimen books prior to and concurrent with the turn of the century, it could be assumed that there was some indirect French influence. <BR> <BR>The problem with genre I think has to do with our perspective. I suspect contemporary type histories are problematic because 1) of the notion that there was a form of cognizant continuum prior to the revival period and 2) the revival period provided a false continuum. <BR> <BR>Early punchcutters and type foundries were not students of the history of type development (Moxon, for instance, had no clue, two hundred years following the development of movable type, of its evolution over the years). They were mainly concerned with the more immediate descendant as passed down in the trade. As type centers moved from slowly from one geographic area to another certain changes occurred, in some cases because of technical developments, but mainly because of regional traditions. <BR> <BR>With the stabilization of photographic equipment and film technology in the late nineteenth century (Kodak: you push the button and we do the rest) the past was opened up for the revival period. In looking at a historical Didot or a Bodoni and any of the moderns of the nineteenth century, certain characteristics would have been detected in the form, and a continuum would have been assumned where one may not indeed have existed. <BR> <BR>The photographic search for materials (hidden away in collections) relating to the renaissance began in the mid-nineteenth century (the Strausberg Documents regarding legalities surrounding Gutenbery were reproduced via the newly available photo collotype process). Emery Walker's photographic investigations of mideval and renaissance letterforms certainly influenced William Morris who as well used the camera for obtaining specimens from the past for his revival designs. <BR> <BR>And Pandora's box was opened.</div>

I was looking through Alex Wilson &amp; Sons specimen from (I think) 1828, and noticed that there was a stack of small, loose printed sheets in the back. One seems to be printed with type from Pierre Didot &ndash; or at least font with his oddly formed 'g'.  <BR> <BR>Anyhow, in my ignorance, it was something I wouldn't have expected to see in a specimen from Scotland.</div>
