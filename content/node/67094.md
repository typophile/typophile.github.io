body: "My \"ignore substition\" OpenType coding (for determining, for example, whether
  a letter is the first in a word so that it can be changed out for an .init swash
  form) works like a charm in InDesign, but it does not in Apple apps like TextEdit
  and Pages. In those applications, nothing is \"ignored\" so that every letter of
  every word becomes the .init form.\r\n\r\nIs this a limitation of those applications,
  or am I doing something wrong? If the former, what's the best option for giving
  the user an easy way to set up context-specific swash forms in those apps?"

  body: I'm running MacOS X 10.6.2 and contextual substitution works correctly in
    Text Edit (1.6) but not in Pages (4.0.3). I seem to recall that Text Edit started
    doing it correctly with the release of 10.6. Perhaps Pages has not gotten the
    fix yet. Which versions of OS and apps are you using?

    I suppose the workaround would be to generate separate font files for the different
    swash forms, for users without access to properly working OpenType setups. But
    then I wonder how many users there are who would go to the trouble of understanding,
    installing, and using separate fonts to get a swash, who also wouldn't have such
    access..."

    the OpenType-impaired), so maybe you''d be just the person to ask: do those sell?'

  body: I think no one using TextEdit would care about contextual substitutions (but
    maybe I am mistaken). If it works in InDesign (and Illustrator), that would be
    good enough for me.

  body: "The fact that it works in Text Edit (in 10.6) means there is OS support and
    that Pages and other Cocoa apps should be able to support contextual subs correctly--just
    not many of them do yet.\r\n\r\nBut, yeah, I think most people interested in using
    OT fonts with advanced layout features will tend to use them with Adobe CS or
    Quark 7 or later. It's very frustrating that support for stuff like that beyond
    pro graphics apps is still so sketchy.\r\n\r\n<em>do those sell?</em>\r\n\r\nI
    don't sell them separately. I include them with the full OT version (no extra
    charge)."
