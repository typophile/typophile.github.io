body: "Hi! I'm a virtual assistant, and one of my clients is author <a href=\"http://www.susanmallery.com\">Susan
  Mallery</a>. (Who's fabulous, by the way... her latest release has been on the NY
  Times paperback list for three weeks now. Woo hoo!) In order to design some ancillary
  materials for her such as bookmarks and eflyers, I'd love to purchase the font that's
  on her book covers. As a jury-rigged solution, I've been stretching Myriad Pro to
  180%, but it's not exactly right. The lines of the M are angled a little too much.
  Only the anal would notice, but since that describes me, I need help. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/under_her_skin_3924.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for the quick ID! I'm going to purchase Gotham. Turns out, I have
    another font to post, but I'll do that in a separate conversation.\r\n\r\nYou
    know, the hardest part of my job is defining \"virtual assistant.\" Basically,
    I do at-home secretarial work. A lot of VAs do bookkeeping, but I'm not a QuickBooks
    expert. I got started late last year, so I'm sort of finding my niche as I go.
    I consider myself to be more sort of my clients' dream secretary. I do a little
    bit of a lot of different things. I'm great with Word and PowerPoint. I'm by no
    means a professional graphic designer, but I can create decent flyers and other
    ancillary  materials, including the copy since I'm a writer. Have Photoshop, will
    travel. It's been an adventure!\r\n\r\nJenel Looney\r\nFreelance writer and virtual
    assistant"
