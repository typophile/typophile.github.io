    \"What the font\"; it suggested \"Georgia Pro Condensed Light\", which is a close
    match, but the shape of the letter \"Q\" is clearly different.'\r\nIn Georgia,
    the uppercase and lowercase o have a straight axis.\r\n\r\nSince Georgia Condensed
    Light and Times might seem to look alike, there is quite a similarity in the flow.
    \ However, the serifs of b and d in Georgia have a straight top and a slanting,
    rounded bottom.\r\nIn Times, the b and d have a slanted top and a straight bottom
    gently rounding to the vertical forms.\r\n\r\nIf you have a word processor or
    a desktop publishing application, test both typefaces and compare them side by
    side."

    like Times to an extent, but it is not any variety of Times that I have access
    to which is all the major ones and a couple of look-alikes. There are some individual
    character differences between the major versions of Times and that shown in the
    book which are troubling.\r\n\r\nUnless you can positively identify the font,
    the closest match would be Times New Roman."

    quite Times-like, but the slender (well, I'm a layperson ...)  \"look & feel\"
    is quite different from the MS Word Times New Roman I know. In this respect (just
    the \"slenderness\") it seems a lot closer to Georgia Condensed Light. Is there
    a Times variety with this property?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help so far!"

    I also guess that there''s not much point in e-mailing the publisher: some volumes
    do have colophones (though not the volume in question), and these show that the
    publisher uses different local providers. So they probably won''t remember who
    did number 15 fourteen years ago. And if they need to scan it now, they probably
    don''t have a PDF at hand ... I''m getting pessimistic about ever finding out
    about the font.'

    agree with George that his is not a match to the book. As you can see it looks
    very conventional. George's explanation that PSMT is post script Monotype makes
    sense to me.\r\nBy the way the rise of digital fonts did not change the practice
    of printing books from metal type until relatively recently. This may have still
    been the practice for the Italian publisher in 2000.\r\nSo we are back to the
    question of where the publisher got this version of Times.\r\nPerhaps an Italian

  body: "An update to the mystery of the font used in the Italian book: I got a response
    yesterday from Customer Service at the publishing house that printed the book
    and he clearly stated that the book was typeset in TIMES NEW ROMAN. Although I
    had asked for the name of their typesetting system during that era, he did not
    reveal that.\r\n\r\nI think we were all certain that yes, it is Times or Times
    New Roman of some flavor, but it really isn't. That was the mystery.\r\n\r\nI
    also received, yesterday, a copy of the book from the Library of Congress to examine.
    The type in the book is clearly digital, possibly even electronically generated.
    The curves are not very smooth in many cases, and many of the thins in characters
    such as /a are broken, which is what I think could happen in a high-speed purely
    electronic system. It makes sense that a very large publisher would have such
    a system.\r\n\r\nIf you guys want me to post a few samples, I have a digital microscope
    that will give you a very good look at the type in the book."

  body: "PS stands for PostScript, MT for Monotype. George Thomas correctly states
    that Times New Roman PS MT is Times New Roman from Monotype. The Linotype/Adobe-version
    is called Times. Times was originally based on the outlines of the Linotype version
    of Times New Roman, which is called Times Roman. The various versions of Times
    New Roman on the one side and Times and Times Roman on the other can be distinguished
    by the top left corners of the counters (the white interior space) of the capitals
    such as B, E and F. The Monotype outlines typically show angular inner corners
    at the top left counters, whereas the Linotype version has rounded corners.\r\n\r\nMonotype
    produced their \u2018PostScript\u2019 version of Times New Roman around 1990,
    the period when almost everyone in the type industry was producing \u2018PostScript
    clones\u2019. In this process Monotype fitted their outlines of Times New Roman
    on the widths of the Linotype/Adobe version. Microsoft was one of Monotype\u2019s
    customers and Windows ships with a version of that more or less PS-compatible
    font data since version 3.1 since its release in 1991. I think that what we see
    on the photocopy is either (a later version of) the Microsoft version, or it is
    Times New Roman PS MT suffering from being typeset in Word and/or medium resolution
    output on a not very professional device. In those days some publishing houses
    saved money by making plates from laser printer output instead from films.\r\nLinotype
    also produced various versions of Times. Next to the Linotype/Adobe version there
    is also Times Ten and Times Eighteen. These are digital versions of Linotype designs
    for different point sizes.\r\n\r\nThe only Italian foundry that ever produced
    a Times look-alike was Simoncini. That typeface was called Life. It is still available
    from Linotype. http://www.linotype.com/de/937/Life-family.html The typeface used
    in the book of L\u2019Erma is clearly not Life. Georgia(condensed) is way off
    too."

    Font ID Guide]]? Since you have the book, it should be relatively easy to compare
    the details with the samples the Guide shows. I have been trying it, and the Q
    from TNR seems to have a different angle to the tail than your sample. The upper
    counter on the g in your samples also seems less rounded than TNR. Ruling out
    Font Bureau's \"Starling\", because it is too new, the Guide would suggest Times
    Eighteen, Times Headline or CG Times. There are italic samples for these, except
    Times Eighteen. My eyeball is not calibrated enough to say anything for sure,
    but you can use the Compare feature to see all of them at the same time, and try
    to sift out differences between the versions. The T serifs are another difference,
    and the italic g and z, as examples. \r\nYou may be able to find enough details

    Jan, I think you are right: In fact, the book's imprint mentions an Italian professor

    but I sent him a message and asked which typeface was used and which typesetting
    system. He wrote back that he's got no clue what I am talking about, but he attaches
    the document as he sent it to the publishing house.\r\n\r\nIt is a Word document
    with the exact page layout of the printed book. The font is Times New Roman. Hm,
    now that I know it, I also notice this short line that divides the text body from
    the foot notes. You can see it in the photocopied/scanned page I have posted above.
    So we're faced with a Word page with more or less default setting.\r\n\r\nBut
    I have to add a stupid question: I am faced with Word/Times New Roman printouts
    on a daily basis. I see it all the time. Why does Times New Roman look in this
    book different to me? Or is this just an illusion?\r\n\r\nAnd: thanks so much
