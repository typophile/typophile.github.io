body: I just realized our wedding invites went out with a typo.  As a self-proclaimed
  grammar-tyrant and editing stickler, is it acceptable to kill myself?  I can't believed
  this happened.

  body: lol. Sorry to laugh but i once worked at a print shop on wedding with expensive
    stock that we had to drill holes for and assemble. There was a typo so she brought
    them back and we reprinted/ re-drilled/ re-essembled. Then she realized the area
    code was wrong so we reprinted/ re-drilled/ re-essembled... except we used the
    pdf with the old typo in it. So we reprinted/ re-drilled/ re-essembled. In otherwords,
    I've felt your pain, not that it will help u much :P

  body: "What kind of a typo--misspelling, misinformation, grammar or puncuation?
    Most people will tolerate puncuation errors, Example:\r\n\r\nI grew up in Poughkeepsie,
    home of Vassar College and every fall, they would put up a huge banner:\r\n\r\nWELCOME\r\nCLASS
    OF 19XX\r\n\r\nAnd every fall, my father would call them and ask: Where's the
    comma? And point out that they were an Ivy League school and should know what
    a parenthetical phrase is. Try getting a birthday cake for this man (we would
    keep extra tubes of icing so we could add the comma).\r\n\r\nI think you better
    reprint. :)\r\n"

  body: "Mmm. My first year editing the cegep \"Arts Journal\", I was also doing a
    lot of the layout preparation which involved re-typing some of the stuff that
    had been submitted on paper. Oh, and proofreading, too. We were only 4 people,
    so everyone did everything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I also included one of my own poems
    in it.\r\n\r\nAfter printing, and distributing copies, and getting up at the podium
    to read at our launch, I noticed right there in the first line of my poem, a massive
    typo. The kind that's worse because it becomes another word that you didn't mean
    at all. I forget what it was now, but realized my mistake and knew I had done
    it as I was reading to the audience.\r\n\r\nAt least it was in my poem and not
    someone else's.\r\n\r\nK."
