  body: "A quick search through the ULTIMA site using the word \"PDF\" came up with
    this page:\r\nhttp://www.ultima.no/en/artists\r\n\r\nThere's a link to a program
    PDF on that page that uses the font shown in your image. The PDF's properties/font
    panel it says the document uses Ultima-Medium. I'm guessing it's a custom font."
