    issue here is the 1--which normally has at least a top serif, even in this style
    (gothic sans) of typeface. \r\n\r\nTrump Gothic Condensed gets the general shape
    right, and if you substitute a capital I for the numeral 1, you've got a decent
    match.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic-pro/\r\n\r\nBlock
    Gothic Extra Condensed isn't bad either:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/\r\n\r\nOr
