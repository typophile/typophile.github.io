  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

First post here, I'm quite glad to have stumbled on this forum!

I'm an on-line TV editor. I place type a lot for broadcast TV. Most on-line editors think that "going the extra mile" with type is adding a drop shadow to your all-caps script font and underlining it for emphasis. I'd like to go a step beyond that, if you know what I mean. Before you all start throwing rocks at me and saying that type on TV is terrible and none of us know what were're doing, here's my question:

If I want to improve my skills, what books can I read to get the basics of typography (short of formal training)?

I carefully kern my type and try to stay away from "trendy" fonts, especially for body text. But there's got to be a "bible" of typography of some sort to make it seem a little less daunting - is there?

Thanks
Phil</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Phil, thanks for asking for the opinion of the Typophiliacs; I'm sure that you will get many good recommendations. Many of which will be for you to read "The Elements of Typographic Style" by Robert Bringhurst. Since its publication in the early 1990s, this handsome book has become the bible for type lovers. It's very well written and easy to read, didactic but not dogmatic, and contains valuable insight for readers at all levels of knowledge, from neophyte through veteran. I can't priase the book enough.

Ellen Lupton's recent "Thinking With Type" is a more basic book, and it is very approachable. Ellen is an educator, and this book is a de facto text book. There is a great companion website: http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/</div>

Do you have "Type In Motion" by Matt Woolman & Jeffrey Bellantoni?  "Creative Titling with Final Cut Pro" by Diannah Morgan? 

about typography —  try the book by Kate Clair "A Typographic Workbook"

I'll definitely look into these. Working well with type is an undervalued skill in my practice, but I think it can be an asset. Type is such a powerful tool.

I'm looking forward to reading these!

		<div class="commentbody">At least typography for television has moved beyond the Chyron IV, which was state-of-the-art when I was a broadcast television art director over twenty years ago. Fonts for the Chyron were all bitmap fonts, and one had to be created for each size used, which was a hassle. Sometimes, progress is good...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Phil,

Just from the point of view of a viewer (aren't we all), my major gripe with text on TV is the tendency to use straight feet-and-inches marks instead of "curly" quotes and apostrophes. That and using "(c)" for a copyright symbol. So long as you use the proper characters for each of these, that'll be a great start!

One advantage of that though was... color! I made fonts for Broadcast Titler (on the Amiga) and the occasional gradation or highlight was highly... fit for TV I guess!

> one had to be created for each size used

I've come to realize this is inherent to the difference between outline fonts and low-res displays. Basically, WYSIWYG (I mean at the letterform fidelity level) does not really exist.

I must not agree with that!

I loved my job at the NBC affiliate in Fort Worth-Dallas, and would probably still be there if the station hadn't hired a  real jerk to head the department. He fired 80% of the staff and replaced them with his handpicked cronies. <em>C'est la guerre (ou d'affaires)</em>.

Things have changed immensely in the past twenty years. Recently, I got a VIP tour of CNN's production facilities in Atlanta, and was blown away by the level of technology available to the art department. Although I wouldn't mind getting back into broadcast TV, twenty years of technology is probably too much for an old dog like me to catch up on...</div>
