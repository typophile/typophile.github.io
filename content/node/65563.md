  one of their old menus for typeface ideas. They came through and gave me this: http://alecquig.com/roccosMenu1951.jpg.
  Can anyone ID any of the four fonts on this menu? \r\n\r\nThank you for your knowledge!

  body: A lot of the type looks like it was output by some sort of low-end typewriter
    kind of machine, such as the IBM Composer or the Varityper. The words "Small"
    and "Large" appear to be set in some version of Univers (1957), which makes me
    think this was not actually set in 1951.

  body: The names of the dishes are definitely <strong>not</strong> made with an IBM
    Selectric Composer in Univers. This is done with the mechanical four-unit Varityper.
    (An IBM Executive typewriter with the Mid-Century face, based on Futura, which
    might be considered to be close, is also not a possibility; this <em>is</em> a
    Varityper.)
