  running out of ideas. Basically, I need some font suggestions, but I&#39;m not sure
  of what kind of fonts I should even <i>use</i>. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions would be
  helpful.

  body: hmm, I don&#39;t really like using bitmap fonts usually. Any other ideas?
    I was assuming I&#39;d probably use grunge or something &#40;the name of the site
    is Psychotic Gaming, I think, i can&#39;t remember&#41;.

  body: Like All Your Base-stylee? Just use one of the many free bitmap fonts designed
    for Flash text at small sizes, blow it up to 36pt, and you&#39;ll have your jaggies.

  body: Ah, nevermind. You can get grunge brushes for Illustrator and Photoshop from
    <a href="http://www.nocturna.net/" target="_blank">http://www.nocturna.net/</a>
    and do your own text overlays if you can&#39;t find a suitable font.

    wind up looking very good, though. But, we&#39;ll see.

    you&#39;ll have to wade through a scad or two of stuff you won&#39;t want.

    scheme, but It&#39;s all I can really come up with for now... Any more ideas,
    or suggestions? Keep in mind I&#39;m not a professional, so this is kind of challenging
    for me. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/35227.gif"

    odd... &#40;Would&#39;ve rather drawn it, but I lack skills in that department&#41;.

  body: Try the opposite and go bold and clean with the type with bright colors. Way
    too much grunge associated with gaming sites, its become old.

  body: Aleph, I think the problem with the cord is that it also resembles the outline
    of a solid shape &#40;think goblet&#41;. Maybe make it cross behind the text and
    plug into the bottom, or give it a loop over itself. <BR> <BR>Could also be due
    to the smoothness of the controller and cord, in contrast to the rough outline
    of the text.

  body: Of course. <BR> <BR>But I figured I&#39;d just try. Maybe I&#39;ll try a real
    bitmap font this time. And Maybe will work on the cord, but it&#39;s really annoying.

    <BR> <BR>look at the styles category, there are a lot of high quality pro-made-free
    styles made by various authors. Also, I think there is a letter brush set for
    phshp. <BR> <BR>hope this helps <BR> <BR>g

    <BR>Is it cliche? Maybe. But it seems to hit the target audience perfectly.
