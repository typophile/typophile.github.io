body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm going to start a book with lots of photos. It will
  have some text (Bi-language) but mainly photos of several sources (digital, film,
  digitalization of old photos, etc. And photos with people, buildind, labels, machines,
  etc.).\r\nI don't want that someone else do the job for me, but I would like to
  see examples of photographic books. I already made my search, but the reason for
  my post is to add some more ideias.\r\nSo, please tell me what books have you saw
  with more or less my references that you enjoyed. Size A4 or bigger...\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\nAnt\xF3nio"
