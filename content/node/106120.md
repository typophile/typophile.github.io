  - and this is all the sample I have.

  body: "Thanks. I did discover the similarity between that House font and the sample,
    but surely it was based on something else that was either Letraset or UK-based?
    I swear I have seen this font used elsewhere. Certainly on a UK record sleeve
    from the early 1980s (not where this sample originated from, unfortunately).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah, I would bet Press Gothic is the source. For the single story l/c 'a',
    you could decapitate a l/c 'd' and bob's yer uncle. Same with Compacta. Nice and
    thank you.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I thought most type designers had un-natural affinities
    towards lower case 'a' and ampersands. Wouldn't take much effort to incorporate
    some crazy alternate glyphs in their digital work would it?"
