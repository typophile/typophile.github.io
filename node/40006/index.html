		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adbusters and First Things First 2000 don’t directly link. First things first is an essay by designers who believe that designers could be doing better things with their talents and abilities than marketing products—products which are, in the view of the authors, unnecessary. There might be a connection to Adbusters by way of inspiration.</p>
<p>Adbusters is an attempt at mocking branding and marketing, in which advertisements and the mainstream media are parodied with recreations of their advertisements and ephemera, usually by altering the wording of an ad campaign. The people behind it refer to their activity as culture jamming, although as I already pointed out in another thread, most people pay no attention, so it’s not so much affecting culture as a dialogue between holier-than-thou hipsters. It has been pointed out that Adbusters itself is a heavily branded, overpriced magazine just like those it often mocks, and that the same can be said for the unbranded products sometimes sold within its pages or by its creators.</p>
<p>Your best bet for understanding the anti-consumerist movement is to go down to the library and start sifting through old issues of Adbusters, or find a local group that engages in this stuff and talk to them. Reading up on Jonathan Barnbrook would be very worthwhile.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The magazine is only overpriced if you compare it to those that carry advertising, which generally provides many times the income that circulation does. Since Adbusters carries no ads, the cover price is naturally going to be at least double what an ad-rich publication will (and remember that an 80 page issue without ads has the same editorial space as a 200 pages magazine that carries ads.</p>
<p>(And no, I am not a holier-than-thou hipster. I have bought exactly 1 copy of the magazine in the last five years.)</p>

Ha! Editorial started this whole mess, we&rsquo;ll end it too.</p>
<p>Whenever there is injustice in the world, wherever there is crime being committed, whenever there is a need for someone to stand up and complain so that someone else will stand up and fix it for those poor shmoes, EDITORIAL WILL BE THERE!</p>
<p>But going back to Adbusters, they do have some hard hitting journalism being conducted. Just recently they had a [[http://www.adbusters.org/the_magazine/73/The_Death_of_Canadian_Journalism.html|scathing exposé about the mass media in Vancouver, BC]]. Damn scary, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Also, their recent coverage of [[http://www.adbusters.org/the_magazine/73/So_Paulo_A_City_Without_Ads.html|São Paulo]]&rsquo;s decision to remove all of their outdoor advertising is a very soothing concept that I wish most cities in America would adopt.</p>

<p>I find the whole anti-advertising/commercialism argument pretty ridiculous. When was the last time you blacked out after watching tv commercials and woke up with 50 boxes of Tide detergent? Advertising helps us decide. Nothing more.</p>

<p>Giggles, you need to get off your duff and do some research in a library. I happen to know that the UK is full of them. Hell, you don’t even need to do that to compare the FSF manifestos—they’re both online.</p>

<p>I once bought Adbusters religiously, and I can tell you right now that the majority of activities in it are designed to make the activist feel good about themselves and be seen to be &ldquo;making a difference.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I started a green marketing company in 1988, and tried to make a go of it for a couple of years.
I worked out a philosophy and practice that addressed the issue of creativity.
As every ad should be, in essence, an environmental audit&ndash;reasoning why the product is justified or an improvement&ndash;there is no place for stretched benefits, i.e. claims and promises which have nothing to do with the product&rsquo;s environmental impact.
For instance, a celebrity endorsement or a suggestion that a car will give the consumer sex appeal or social status.
That challenged a lot of the notions of creativity which exist in advertising, making it quite restricted.
As well as &ldquo;non-creative&rdquo; ads, it was also hard to get clients to buy into the idea that, for instance, smaller ads were better. Creatives, of course, like big ads with white space.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that the traditional business qualities advertisers look for in an agency are the be-all and end-all: price, quality (includes creativity), and service, and called it a day in 1990, by which time the green buzz of the late &rsquo;80s was fading and digitization was capturing everyone&rsquo;s imagination. No doubt I could have kept at it longer if I&rsquo;d been a better salesman.</p>
<p>There are a small number of green and pro bono agencies, and they will remain a small number. Some environmentally-favorable practices occur in the industry, notably to do with materials used, but that doesn&rsquo;t address the central issue of consumption-stimulation, and the role played by &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; in hyping it.</p>
<p>There is only so much that business can do, because its bottom line is the bottom line.
It&rsquo;s up to governments to regulate consumption&ndash;in the aggregate, citizens and corporations have too much self-interest to make much of a difference individually, despite the best efforts of a green minority.</p>

<p>Reminds me of a book my company published in the very early 90s on Global Warming, which nobody bought. Way before its time unfortunately, nobody got it then.</p>
