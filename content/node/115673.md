    (Extra)Compressed is the /0 counter bottom which is not flat (but easily editable).
    You could also have a look to all other "Helvetica-Compressed-Black-like": [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/inserat|Inserat]]
    ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/british-inserat|British Inserat]]
    looks decent to me), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/haettenschweiler|Haettenschweiler]],
