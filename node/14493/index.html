<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello all my name is Erica i just wanted to post some thoughts of mine on here, im starting out in this world of type so i dont know to much but i have had alot of thoughts. please feel feel to comment thats why were here :)
I have always been a creator of sorts and went to many different font sites to check out the latest designs, though it upset me i never could get the "free" font to download, i could always look at them. i didnt really have to much use for them then because i didnt do that kind of creating. but now as i have started my way into the graphic design world i find that right now i am using text alot and new and different fonts could come in handy. right now im just using the regular apple fonts that came with my MAC (which im falling in love with) but i think i would like to venture outward and take advantage of these designer fonts. but i have come to a question, when i am designing mock logos for any of my design classes are these internet fonts ok to use? is that a normal thing to do? when i go to make a real logo for a company one day will it be ok to use one of these internet designer fonts for a company, or must you come up with your own? im not sure how all that works.
and mostly it fasinates me how someone can design an entire alphabet of designer fonts that do not look anything like another, where do you get your ideas???
as i have scaned through just about every forum topic on this web page i can see how far advanced most of the people here are, and makes me feel that there is a ton more to learn and that there is alot more involved with designing things that i do not see yet. the longest read was about
"hidefweb solutions" this person had 6 pages of series of logos for this one company each page of design was different from the next but the content of each page individually were variations of the style being portrayed. and the company said that non of them hit to home, they wanted a text based logo, not so much an image because they were expanding. well there were some really good varieties of designes going on there, but to fathum that the company could not pick one?? hmmmmm i must be missing something. it must be my untrained eyes. what am i missing
last this one will stray off topic, have you ever seen the movie "HERO" wow good stuff well in there they explain the relationship of how thier ancient scrips (the writting they do with a large brush and paper) goes hand in hand with sword fighting, now how beautiful is that? i want to learn how to sword fight. just check out the movie :)
now most of you might beable to reference which discussions i speek of here in the forums, because yall get around, this place is pretty awsome, i should hope to beable to submit worthwile comments in the future. :) good luck everyone have a good night

<div class=commentbody>It's ok to do work based on already existing fonts, IBM logo is based in Berthold's City font for example. Many logos are based on modified versions of already existing fonts and then there are many hand drawn logos too.
It is up to you to decide if a font face is appropriate for a work or a new lettering needs to be done.
A dirty little secret: I made my own logo from scanned letters of DTL Nobel (a font I didn't wanted to buy).

<div class=commentbody>Hello Erica,
yes, there is a lot to learn and many to learn from, but you've taken that bold step by joining into forum.
Yes... I did see "Hero" and have the DVD... and yes, I do know how to sword fight with the Chinese TaiChi Jian Sword as well... honest.

<div class=commentbody>Erica, welcome! Yes, it's not "usual" to design a complete font... But it's a unique challenge with special rewards, and you seem to already have an important ingredient: you think it's fascinating!
Using a free/cheap font for a logo: that's actually safer than using such fonts for text! Because you have a chance to look closely at the beziers and fix stuff as needed; for text a font has to be adequate out of the box. To be fair though, not all free/cheap fonts suck. And some reputable foundries even give out quality free fonts, sort of as bait.
BTW, I've always wanted to learn swordfighting. There are different styles I guess; to me the stuff at the Olympics is least interesting, because it has neither romanticism nor spirit; I prefer what might be called "Conan-style", but most of all I would love to learn to properly use a wakizashi. The katana seems too... loud. I actually have a Japanese sword set (although it's stored half a world away now) but the most action it's seen was against a side of ham.
One parallel between swordfighting and making type I guess is the level of concentration required: putting your life on the line and making a good quality font cannot be done casually (even though few type designers rely on type to make a living).

<div class=commentbody>I did western fencing during many years. The only reason it can look like having no 'romanticism nor spirit' is because people is familiarized with Hollywood's fights.
Real fencing, (like real martial arts) is faster and looks completely different to 'choreographered' fencing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess you could say that the Olympics has become more Hollywood, but I know that when I watch "professional" western fencing, I feel nothing. It seems to be parallel to the formalistic, clinical, sterile state that Kung Fu was in (at least in the west) until Bruce Lee showed up.

<div class=commentbody>Even the competitors in katas, wushu and weapons forms nowadays admit that the only way they can score higher points with the judges is to throw in flashy and overly dramatic actions... nothing that would ever be used in actual combat.
Conversely, the system I currently study is incredibly BORING to watch. Traditional Yang Family style Tai Chi (Taiji) is like wathcing paint peel, and the more advanced you are, the less movements are visible (all internal).
BTW -- my niece, <a href=http://nusports.collegesports.com/sports/w-fenc/mtt/florendo_jessica00.html>Jessica</a>, is a foil champion and is very exciting to watch. She floats like a butterfly and stings like a B*tch!

<div class=commentbody>The west is increasingly becoming centered on Liability. These days you can't even install a sprinkler system in your back yard the way you want it. Ergo: for real swordfighting, you'll have to leave the country. And leave your travellers cheques at home.
