  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings everyone&hellip; <BR> <BR>I hope this is the right forum to be posting this on. I dont have a particular font that needs identification, but thought I would pick some of your brains to lead me down the right patch.  <BR> <BR>If this is in the wrong forum, I apologise, and will repost to the appropriate forum. <BR> <BR>I am doing research for a (student) project where I would like to riff off some old postcard design. I have attached a few examples of what I feel to be the typographic direction I would like to go in. <BR> <BR>I am aware that the main typefaces used here were most likely hand drawn or photo-type, but was wondering if anyone could reccommend any fonts with similar proportions or forms. <BR> <BR>I also wouldnt be surprised if there were a few websites offering galleries, or perhaps hi-res scans of some of these designs&hellip; does anyone know of anything in this vein? <BR> <BR>In terms of acheiving the dimension of the text. I was wondering if any of you had suggestions or a particular method that you use. I have been using  KPT Vector tools in Illustrator to achieve the dimension, and then using Pshop to get the curvature, but have not been very pleased with the results. <BR> <BR>My final question which is more type id related, is also  in relation to the postcards. In attempting to recreate this style, i am seeking some distressed typefaces that still maintain some semblance of typographic dignity&hellip; any foundries come to mind? Distressed i mean in the terms of looking like the ink has bled, or just general wear. Has a distressed version of Futura or similar fonts used during that era been released?   <BR> <BR>Perhaps some of you could share information on technique?  I think it might have been here, there was a thread that linked to a silkscreen site that contained graphics to lay over text in illustrator to acheive this effect. Are there any other places on the net to find these types of graphics?  <BR> <BR>Thank you in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond to my post.  <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Handsome Dan <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8081.jpg" alt="postcard one..."> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8082.jpg" alt="postcard two"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8083.jpg" alt="postcard three"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8084.gif" alt="...cant forget this one..."></div>

But I don't think it will help you with what you're after. <BR> <BR>The word &quot;Denton&quot; in your third example is set in Balloon. The script above it and the script in the first example may be set from type. But the rest is probably all hand-lettering. <BR> <BR>If this is a learning project, then you might just consider turning off the computer and trying your hand at drawing letters like these. You'll learn a lot that way. Try a library or used book store for some old books on hand-lettering &ndash; sign-painting or advertising. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent- <BR> <BR>Thanks for your note! I was actually considering a career in signwriting&hellip; here in Australia you can actually get a degree in it, and it takes awhile, and you have to apprentice and everything. The market is a bit flooded though, and the biggest problem is really my handwriting. I just cant draw a straight line!  <BR> <BR>Either way, could you possible reccommend a decent book to check out? I have some old speedball manuals, but i didnt find them clear. <BR> <BR>As for font ID's, my current infatuation is with <a href="http://www.vintagelabels.org" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.vintagelabels.org">www.vintagelabels.org</a></a>. Can anyone ID the main sans-serif that they use on their page. Im particularly interested in the faces used on the oceanliner pages. The geometric sans' towards the back are particularly appealing. They remind me a little of the new hoefler faces, but as a student now, its out of the financial picture. Any other suggestions? Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR></div>

I've literally wasted days drooling over the type on these maps. For your purposes, there are old train schedules from the 1800 - 1900's that have just that <i>Peoria, Texas, and Washington </i> type you're looking for. Use these letters to draw your own. There isn't really another way to do this well. Stretching and pulling letters using envelopes in photoshop, illustrator, or kpt will not get it done. You will spend more time looking for fonts and manipulating them, than you would drawing and learning. Plus there's nothing more fun than drawing woodtype. (ok, I'm a type nerd) <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com">http://www.davidrumsey.com</a></a> <BR> <BR>Man, I can't believe I just posted that beauty. It's got all the fonts I'm planning to digitize for release in 2010 :-) Enjoy. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

It seems like people want to hang on to their secrets gems rather than get the word out. I've often dreamed of a destination for designers that had links to all kinds of incredible resources like those. Not just a fat list, but well done and organized by keywords etc. Does it exist already? <BR> <BR>So, I wasted another 1/2 day looking a WPA Posters scanned at 28Megs over at American Memories.
