  and Modernist typefaces?\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me out on what to look for please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  thought I knew how to tell, but when it came to it, I just completely forgot. \r\nI
  keep thinking it's something to do with the angle of letters and how geometric they
  look??\r\n\r\n\r\n(if you get your info from a website can you link me please as
  I need references, thanks)\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks in advance anyway"

  body: "Hei Chris. Look at a, e and R for example. \r\n\r\nHumanist (Serifs, Sans,
    Slab) a's mostly have an open upper counter and a rather small bowl; the e has
    an open, friendly looking \xBBmouth\xAB; R has a diagonal, often long, maybe swashy
    tail. The caps are of different width, following the proportions of the ancient
    Roman letterforms. \r\nIf the typeface has contrast the stroke is likely to be
    thickest north-east and south-west (you can draw a diagonal line trough the thinnest
    parts). In the venetian subclass the e has a diagonal crossbar. If the typeface
    has serifs they are bracketed and asymmetric.\r\n\r\nTransitional typefaces have
    more regular forms. Letters like a and e are rather open, but not as lively and
    divers as in a humanist face. R has a diagonal tail, possibly shorter. The Caps
    are more regular in width. Stroke contrast is mostly symmetrical to a vertical
    axis. Serifs are bracketed but more symmetrical as well. These typefaces stand
    in between Humanist and Modern, hence the name.\r\n\r\nModern typefaces, like
    Didones but also Grotesque have rather closed forms of e and a. The width of the
    Caps are quite similar and more narrow, also the lowercase letters look comparatively
    alike (b, d, p, q). The R has a more vertical leg ((here my knowledge of the proper
    english terms are leaving me)). The stroke contrast is extremely high with a vertical
    axis. In the Didone style serifs are very thin and not bracked. There is a subclass
    with bracketed serifs, like Century for instance, for which we are all still looking
    for a good name.\r\n"
