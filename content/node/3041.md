  body: Hmmm... looks like the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot/"
    target="_blank"> Peignot</a> for the 21st century.  <BR>Doesn&#39;t ring a bell.
    I&#39;ll do some research at lunch break.

  body: My guess is that it&#39;s a custom logo, though the Agito website crashed
    my machine, and I couldn&#39;t look through the site for other examples of the
    face. But for a typeface with a similar flavor, try Barry Deck&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/template-gothic/">Template
    Gothic</a>.

    this is drawn by a Japanese who has good design skills, but doesn&#39;t know Roman
    letters that well.   '
