body: "I'm working on feature code in FontLab for a fully connecting script. Since
  it has pretty wide letterspacing I created versions of both letters and ligatures
  that would not normally have a starting stroke. So, for example, a lowercase o or
  an o_l ligature would have one version each that has a lead in stroke and one each
  with no lead in stroke. To make things even more complicated there are versions
  of ligatures that have ending that are supposed to come at the end of a word even
  if followed by punctuation such as a comma or quote. I used a series of classes
  and the feature clig with lookups to make this work. \r\n\r\nSo far everything worked
  smoothly until I discovered that for some reason ligatures that start with a cap
  work just the opposite as they should. So if I type in the OT preview: cool followed
  by a space; I get c followed by the o_o_l.end ligature which has a left side connector
  on the o and an ending version of l. Same for o_n followed by ool space. But if
  I type in Atool space (A_t being a ligature) I get the wrong version. Logically
  this would mean that A_t must be in the wrong OT classes. I checked this over again
  and again, but they all seem to be placed correctly. As an interesting experiment
  I type the A_t ligature manually in the text window of the OT preview and it worked
  exactly as it should have. So its only going wrong when the preview window does
  the substitution for me. I can't see why a ligature starting with a cap would not
  work like any other ligature or glyph combination. \r\n\r\nAny ideas? Also\u2026
  \ pardon the scrolling image. I wanted to get all the samples showing this behavior.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OT_Preview_4945.gif]"

    of characters within the contextual alternates feature.\r\nYou want the proper
    cursive joins as default behaviour, don't you?\r\n\r\nSo each character would
    have a maximum of nine alternates, based on combinations of:\r\n\r\n* no lead-in
    stroke, no exit stroke\r\n* no lead-in stroke, high exit stroke\r\n* no lead-in
    stroke, low exit stroke\r\n* low lead-in stroke, no exit stroke\r\n* low lead-in
    stroke, high exit stroke\r\n* low lead-in stroke, low exit stroke (the default)\r\n*
    high lead-in stroke, no exit stroke\r\n* high lead-in stroke, high exit stroke\r\n*
    high lead-in stroke, low exit stroke\r\n\r\nThis to be used in combination with
    the \"ignore\" command for beginnings and endings.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@Adam \r\nYou might be right about a bug in the code, but it sure is hard
    ti find if that's the case. I've checked my OT classes and my feature code and
    it seems to be set up the same for ligatures with the same ending strokes. What
    makes me wonder more is that when I just type in the OT feature preview \"At\"
    followed by \"ool\" it doesn't work right. But if I type in /A_t for the \"At\"
    then it shows up correctly. If the code or classes were wrong wouldn't it behave
    the same in both instances? If you look closely at the first instance of \"Atool\"
    in the sample you will see that the o_o_l has no connecting stroke so the \"At\"
    does not quite connect. In the second where I typed in /A_t it has that connector
    stroke.\r\n\r\n@Nick\r\nGranted that would be a solution, but would work best
    on fonts that have a more rigid structure. If you look at the top sample where
    no ligatures are used it does connect cleanly. But you don't get that same fluidity
    of strokes that having some ligatures allows. Since the connections are particularly
    long in this style fluid connections are much harder to attain without ligatures."

  body: "Nick\r\nI think the way I'm using ignore is still correct, but in a very
    different context from how its being used for random substitution which this is
    pretty much the opposite of. There is nothing random here that I'm attempting.
    I'm calling up very specific substitutions that just happen to work for a lot
    of ligatures. The ignore here is used only once and its purpose is to cause the
    o_o_l.start and the o_o_l.start2 ligatures to come in at the beginning of a line
    of text. Having the subs for the same ligatures in a contextual sequence (after
    @Uncon) above the ignore rule allows these same beginning versions to come in
    after either a space or an non-connecting letter as well. \r\n\r\nIn the OT feature
    preview window its working fine. I still need to generate this and test in applications,
    but I think it will work."

    starting with an A don't. So if I were to type in Af to get the A_f ligature which,
    unlike the A_t,  has no right side connection then the connected version of o_o_l
    comes in\u2026 just the opposite of what it should. If I type it in as /A_f  which
    bypasses the OT feature preview sub rules for that glyph, then the correct o_o_l

  body: OK. I did a quick test in Illustrator and am getting the same results as in
    the OT feature preview. So somewhere along the way its not working for the A_t  A_t_t  A_f
    and  A_f_t ligatures. I might need to write code specific to those ligatures if
    all else fails. Everything else seems to be coming in as it should though, so
    I just need to figure out that piece of the puzzle.

    not about randomness, but explains \"ignore\" for intial and final forms.\r\n\r\nOne
    problem with substitutions is that they don't work very well at the beginning
    or end of a line of text in a layout application, as apps use a non-character
    space there. So to get the substitutions to always work, it may be necessary for
    the end user to type an actual space at either end of a text string on a single
    line. \r\n"

    can never get an end of line character to come in. That I understand as there
    is no way to get a layout app to recognize a character as being end of line. \r\n\r\nIn
    Karsten's post he states \r\n\"the sole purpose of this subtable is to \"catch\"
    all contexts listed in the ignore statement.\r\n\r\nLayout engines follow the
    rule that if a glyph or glyph sequence has been consumed by a subtable, then all
    following subtables will be skipped for this glyph or glyph sequence.\"\r\n\r\nMy
    ignore statement:\r\n ignore sub @All o' o' l';\r\nThis essentially says ignore
    this substitution if there is any glyph of any kind before the sequence. Since
    at the beginning of a line you have no glyph, then the subtable does not \"catch\"
    this sequence as listed in the ignore statement. \r\n\r\nI do agree about the
    end of line context. An ignore statement will not work on an end of line. I've
    never been able to get that to work. I can get an end of word sub if there is
    a space or punctuation following it. So for end of line subs the user will have
    to add this by selection in their layout app.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fixed as well, but I'm not clear about why it didn't work right off. I put A_t
    and other A_ligatures at the top of the list in the clig feature before all the
    lookups. That seemed to do the trick. But why they need to come before these lookups
    and the other ligatures and glyphs didn't still seems a mystery.
