  body: I'm afraid this could be a custom job. Hard to say as it's very neutral and
    generic. It shares somes similarities with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/yoga-sans-pro/|Yoga
    Sans]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026|Whitney]]
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/fedra-sans-alt-pro/|Fedra Sans Alt]]
    or even [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/trebuchet/|Trebuchet]].

  body: Close but no cigar! Many thanks. Probably a blend of the above, with a bit
    of tweaking. Bless you.
