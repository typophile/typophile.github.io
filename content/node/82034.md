  I would love to find an alternative font which has italic versions to be used for
  a commercial magazine.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any font? Something fairly quirky
  for headlines but would be suitable for small sizes and lengthy body copy? \r\n\r\nI
  am about to start trawling font libraries myself, but would really be interested
  if any of you have suggestions.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n"
