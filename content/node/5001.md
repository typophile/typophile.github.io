body: 'I am in high school, and I type essays and other material Literature and also
  History. When I type essays et al., I generally use Times New Roman, because that
  is the default in most word processors, including MS Word at school and OpenOffice.org
  at home. However, I do not like this typeface, as it seems narrow and rather ugly.
  I am wondering what might be a good replacement typeface that would look good but
  not be too wacky as it would not be accepted by my teachers. I have done a little
  research into typography in general, and it seems that I prefer oldstyle lettering
  to modern &#40;e.g. the contrast between narrow and wide, the way the thin points
  of an `o&#39; are vertically aligned from each other in modern, et al.&#41;. What
  might I use? <BR> <BR>P.S.: My father has legal access to almost every version of
  Photoshop and Illustrator, so typefaces that come with those applications are easily
  accessable. Also, I am a high school student, and I would like to avoid spending
  $100 on a typeface, so try to suggest ones of little or no cost. <BR> <BR>Thank
  you in advance, <BR>Iain'

    comes in a wide version, or, even better, extra-wide. Will save you countless

  body: Yes, teachers still require students to submit papers in MLA format, which
    is 12pt double-spaced, <i>x</i> number of pages, etc. etc. <BR> <BR>Although Berlidin
    looks nice enough, it seems so wide that I am sure a teacher would notice the
    wideness and mark points off for that. At school I have found something called
    Palatino on some computers, Palatino Linotype on others, and both on some. They
    seem identical except Palatino Linotype has more leading. Would these work for
    schoolwork? Also, I have found a typeface called Georgia, but the problem is that
    numerals are non-lining, and I do not know if my teacher would object. I unfortunately
    do not seem to have Palatino at home, although I do have Palatino Linotype. Is
    there somewhere I could get Palatino for free if it is a good typeface for homework?

  body: 'Palatino at 12pt. actually occupies a bit more space than Times, which can
    be a pretty significant gain over a few page essay.  This is a Good Thing if you
    have page limits, but Palatino does look quite a bit different in terms of page
    color, so the teacher might notice. <BR> <BR>If you wanted something in the same
    vein that&#39;s just a better type, perhaps you should try a Baskerville, maybe
    like <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/jbasker.html">Storm&#39;s</a> or <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/baskerville1757.asp">Fountain&#39;s</a>.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also used Jenson and Garamond, and I prefer them both to Transitional
    types for this sort of paper. <BR> '

    the added readability. &#40;Of course, that was back in the ancient days of dot-matrix
    printers.&#41; I never had one mark me down for it.  <BR> <BR>Yes, Whitman would
    be a sweet font for a paper, and your English teacher would probably give you
    extra points!

  body: I would say just use Times New Roman, I mean they are the ones reading the
    paper, if thats what they are prefering you to write the essay in it makes sense.
    With an essay or something you aren&#39;t really going for presentation after
    all. <BR> <BR>Although if this was going to be published in some sort of compliation
    at the school for others to read then I would look at typeface selection. That
    Whitman font looks really nice.

  body: Great suggestions all. The only thing I do not like about Whitman &#40;other
    than the price as you pointed out&#41; is that it seems almost like a sans serif
    typeface with blocky serifs added on, rather than having thick and thing strokes
    and having serifs that curve from the text. That may be merely a matter of preference
    though, and it may look fine at small sizes, I do not know. <BR> <BR>About the
    Baskerville typefaces, the first one &#40;Storm&#39;s&#41; I question only because
    they basically said they were too cheap to look at all his work and copy it, they
    just looked at some letters and made the rest in the same style. <BR> <BR>On the
    other hand, Fountain&#39;s version has no boldface typeface. I don&#39;t use boldface,
    but what if I needed to for some reason? <BR> <BR>By the way, does anyone know
    if any of these typefaces are included with any Adobe software? <BR> <BR>Thanks,
    <BR>Iain

  body: Hmm, well it looks like Palatino Linotype is right out, the line- and word-spacing
    is too large for print, although it looks great on my screen---1280x960, CRT monitor,
    opentype anti-aliasing. <BR> <BR>Well thanks for the suggestions, I&#39;ll see
    if I can get any---though Berlidin seems a bit wide, I&#39;ll check out the others
    for sure.

  body: Iain, does your dad have Illustrator CS, it comes bundled with a bunch of
    fonts that you could use. But remember, its the content not the look of the paper
    that the teacher will grade you on. If you write in Eubonics I bet you get a bad
    grade.  <BR> <BR>What was the only state in the nationwide Eubonics beauty contest
    not to show up?
