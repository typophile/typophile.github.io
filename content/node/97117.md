  body: Yes they are misused sometimes, but tasers can also save lives (of both officers
    and suspects) by disabling dangerous suspects without use of lethal force.

  body: Reminds me of a local electrician. He'd used as side art on his service wagon
    an illustration of a flashing and sparking skeleton. Self-referential humour,
    mind, as he was known for getting into (literally) shocking situations.

  body: "use of lethal force is a whole different argument. Police are trained to
    shoot for 'centre of body mass'. I.e., shoot to kill. If there are heavily indoctrinated
    to shoot for the centre of body mass and if they shoot to injure, they are liable
    to be disciplined for negligence. On the other hand, how about training them to
    use their heads and defuse tense situations instead of escalating them like idiot
    teenage jocks. \r\n\r\nTasers reduce the likely hood a cop will bother to talk
    a situation down before playing Quick Draw McGraw.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dzieka%C5%84ski_Taser_incident\r\n\r\nIf
    (IF) I were to enter this contest the result would be so obscenely violent, Tsaser
    International would wish they had never had this bright idea. \r\n\r\n:o) "
