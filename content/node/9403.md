body: Looking for websites that contain images of classic type related posters and
  imagery. Especially looking for dynamic spreads and posters from the likes of Muller-Brockmann
  and all things modernist, dada, constructivist. If there&#39;s not already?? wouldn&#39;t
  it be great to have a central museum style website devoted to classical and contemporary
  typography. <BR> <BR>Cheers
