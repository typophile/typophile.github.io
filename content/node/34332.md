body: I'm using Centaur as body text in a brochure. Client likes Centaur but hates
  the "1" glyph. (Says it looks too much like a capital "I".) Could anyone suggest
  a typeface that's similar enough to Centaur that I could just swap out the 1s...?
  Or if that sounds unlikely, any recommendations for something Centaur-like to switch
  to entirely? Thanks in advance.

  body: Centaur was based on type cut by Nicolas Jenson. You could try using an optical
    variation of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1715.html?newsample=1+am+not+I&=View">Adobe
    Jenson Pro</a>, which is arguably a more flexible font.

  body: Use a lowercase l. You may have to adjust the size slightly to match the numeral
    height.

  body: I have used Centaur for a long time and the number one glyph has always bothered
    me too. The Adobe Jenson Pro idea looks good in practice - you have to use the
    Jenson Pro Light to balance weight with the Centaur Regular. Thanks for the idea
    Scott.
