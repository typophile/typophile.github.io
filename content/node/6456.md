  body: Paul <BR> <BR>I liked very much your work with metron, and here you have a
    nice work too.  <BR> <BR>I think that &#34;W&#34; and &#34;M&#34; looks to tight,
    and that makes them look too heavy, see the diference of weight betwen &#34;W&#34;
    and &#34;X&#34;. <BR> <BR>the &#34;7&#34; is too heavy on top, i would try to
    move the descender a little bit to he left.  <BR> <BR>I think something is wrong
    with the &#34;B&#34; and &#34;S&#34;, but i don&#39;t know what. <BR> <BR>the
    &#34;Y&#34; needs more space betwen the &#34;head and the tail&#34;. <BR> <BR>i
    think the horizontal in the center of the &#34;R&#34; shouldn&#39;t be curvy.
    <BR> <BR>i don&#39;t get use to the &#34;6&#34; and the &#34;9&#34;, but i think
    they would work right. <BR> <BR>i love &#34;C&#34; , &#34;A&#34;, &#34;D&#34;,
    &#34;X&#34; and &#34;E&#34; <BR> <BR>very nice work <BR> <BR>CG

    Paul. You&#39;re on your way to   <BR>achieving it.  <BR>  <BR>Cristian is right
    about the &#39;Y&#39;. But I recognize your problem -   <BR>you were obviously
    trying to keep the middle bar consistent   <BR>on the &#39;Y&#39; and &#39;R&#39;.
    But the higher bars on the &#39;A&#39; &#39;B&#39; &#39;E&#39; work  <BR>fine
    so there is room to raise it on the &#39;Y&#39;. Or, are you   <BR>opposed to
    a descender?  <BR>  <BR>Consistent widths is a definite issue here. In addition
    to  <BR>Cristian&#39;s comments, I&#39;ll add that the &#39;J&#39; seems too wide
    and  <BR>the &#39;H&#39; too narrow.  <BR>  <BR>The &#39;H&#39; also feels too
    straight with the flat ends. I wonder if  <BR>there&#39;s a way to give them an
    angle as on the &#39;A&#39; and &#39;N&#39;.   <BR>See if you can make it happen
    without a Hobo effect. <BR> <BR>The &#39;B&#39; and &#39;S&#39; look fine to me.

  body: This is rockin&#39;. I&#39;d agree with Stephen that the &#39;J&#39; seems
    too wide - maybe it should be more along the lines of &#39;L.&#39; I might say
    too that the &#39;T&#39; feels a bit too straight. Also, much like the &#39;Y,&#39;
    the &#39;2&#39; seems too have some quirky proportions because of the middle bar
    or spine.  <BR> <BR>I wonder if modeling the &#39;W&#39; after conjoined &#39;U&#39;s
    insteaded of &#39;V&#39;s might be worth trying. Or perhaps modifying a rotated
    &#39;E.&#39; <BR> <BR>Love the &#39;Q&#39; and the &#39;X&#39; is great.

  body: Perhaps it&#39;s silly, but I like &#39;X&#39; because - on my screen anyway
    - it appears to have nice subtle curves to it. Which keep it from being too straight
    &#40;e.g., &#39;H&#39; &amp; &#39;T&#39;&#41; and without, as Stephen warns, turning
    into Hobo.  <BR> <BR>The more I look, the more I think the leg on &#39;R&#39;

    I agree with the comments so far. I really like the uniqueness of the <i>9</i>
    Could this somehow be used to solve the problem with the <i>Y</i>? I don&#39;t
    think you are the only designer to ever have problems designing a <i>W</i>. As
    your <i>V</i> is so wide, maybe too wide, I think you could make the <i>W</i>
    a little wider and perhaps add some air. And perhpaps round the corners on that
    apex?  <BR>  <BR>Nice though. Where was this when I was forced to use Handel Gothic?  <BR>  '

    looks funny. Maybe you should stagger the arms. <BR>M - Looks too stiff. <BR>W
    - Too closed and narrow. <BR>X - Same problem as the &#34;K&#34;, plus too wide.
    <BR>7 - Try making the spine like the &#34;2&#34;. <BR> <BR>Accents: the tilde
    is too big, the rest too small. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also some color issues, like
    the &#34;N&#34; is too dark, and the Section too light. <BR> <BR>The Pilcrow rules.
    As for the Yen, you should ask a Japanese guy, but it seems too cramped - maybe
    reduce the bowl, or use one bar. The Euro I think needs longer bars. <BR> <BR>Keep

  body: This is fantabulous! <BR> <BR>But the 6 and 9 don&#39;t look very stable.
    Maybe move the tails just a wee bit more towards the axis. <BR> <BR>J, U and V
    look too wide, optically at least. <BR> <BR>The ampersand could do with more curves,
    no? It looks bolder than the rest now. Try it with a back like the &#34;3&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>I think the horizontal bars on the Euro and the Yen might be too thin.
    <BR> <BR>Just my two cents. <BR> <BR>When it&#39;s done be sure to tell us where
    to get it. <BR> <BR>

    done such a good job with this diacritic letter, I really encourage you to do
    the rest of the Polish letters and extend the languagre coverage for the central
    European, Baltic and Turkish character sets. I think you would have a lot of fun
