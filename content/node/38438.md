  please the name of the font, used for the title? \r\nMonday evening i visited a
  lecture of the japanese designer Kenya Hara, and afterwords i bought his book, with
  the titel: Designing Design. By the way, it is written in english and it's worth
  to read. It's the first publication of his work in english language. At amazon.com
  it's much more cheaper than here in Europe.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ke00_6652.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ke02_5105.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ke03_6347.JPG]"

  body: There are some latin typefaces designed in Japan that most of us don't know.
    This could be one of those. <a href="https://www.axisfont.com/index.php">AXIS</a>
    is another.

  body: Yes, i looked carefully at. There you could find any sort of fine papers or
    printers and binders, but nothing about the fonts.

    been designed specially as a logo, by Kenya Hara's studio, based on the Univers.
