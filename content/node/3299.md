body: Hi Guys <BR> <BR>Iam just going through some old disks to prepare for a talk
  Iam giving to some students. I came across this face I started back in 1999. <BR>
  <BR>Do you think it&#39;s worth trying to do something with, or is it a lost cause?

  body: 'Jim, this one is definitely not a lost cause, imo. <BR>However, you might
    investigate similar faces <BR>before proceeding. The &#39;technoish&#39; rounded
    square shape <BR>has been used quite a bit and is a fairly accessible <BR>jumping
    off point to start a typeface. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d check Identikal, WWFT, and Cape
    Arcona to start with. <BR>Maybe also check with some of your Union Font <BR>designers
    ... some of them may have already gone <BR>down this road. <BR> <BR> <BR>Some
    initial comments: <BR> <BR>f - perhaps extend the upper arch <BR>j - perhaps extend
    the lower arch <BR>k - the upper arm needs some work, imo <BR>m - this should
    not be two &#39;n&#39;s in width <BR>or it&#39;ll seem too wide. <BR>w - see above
    <BR> <BR>best of luck. <BR> <BR>bj'
