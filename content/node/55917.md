body: "If you're a Philadelphia designer working primarily in the print medium, I
  have a question for you. Well, if you're a magazine designer anywhere, you might
  also be able to shed some light into the mystical world.\r\n\r\nHow does one get
  into the wonderful world of magazine design in the city of brotherly love? Who should
  I be focusing my attention on, directing my communications towards? \r\n\r\nI was
  thinking of contacting the art directors, but I suspect that, that might be futile.
  And should probably aim lower or elsewhere (production department?, General HR?)\r\n\r\nI
  apologize for the unprofessional sound of this post. I'm really just looking for
  the nitty-gritty and to perhaps do a little networking with some fellow Typophiles.\r\n\r\nInformation
  is value to me now.\r\n"
