  body: "At first glance i saw OB, then a second look made me see CB. Something about
    how the top of the C slides into the top of the B seems unresolved. Same with
    the bottom of the C joining the bottom of the B. \r\n\r\nPerhaps its the weight
    of the B's vertical Stem in comparison to the heavy back of the C. The bowls of
    the B match the C but it looks like the counter space of the C is eating into
    the stem of the B.\r\n\r\nWorking that counter a bit might really define the characters
    and make a nice monogram. \r\n\r\nIt looks good though. Nice work. Sorry if I
    have crossed my O's and C's\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the comment. First, to clarify, it's an \"OB\" monogram. I also
    thought that perhaps the stem of the B is too weak, especially in proportion to
    the back of the O and the end of the B. On the other hand, I don't want the bridge/web
    between the bottom and top of the O and B to be too heavy. Do you prefer the copy
    below?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monogram-copy_4463.png]\r\n\r\nCompared
    to the original below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monogram-Big_3649.png]\r\n\r\nI
    personally feel that thickening the B stem actually throws off the balance of
    the monogram; the strength of the outer sides (left side of the O, right side
    of the B) makes up for a weaker center. Something about the increased thickness
    makes me feel that the letters are separately defined and the monogram is gluing
    them together, rather than the mark being a self-contained, more stylized symbol.
    But let me know your feelings about this; I can be easily persuaded.\r\n\r\nOB"

  body: "I do prefer the new thicker stem but I see your point. You'll have to print
    it at the size you expect it to be seen to be sure of the stem's effect on the
    monogram.\r\n\r\nWell you have my opinion but thats just one. Keep shopping it
    around. I do like it."

  body: I, too, did what Pentapus did. I saw OB at first, then thought maybe it was
    a CB. Is that a big deal? Maybe. Maybe not. It's a nice mark, though.
