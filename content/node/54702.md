body: "I am currently doing a project for a restaurant in Glasgow. The restaurant
  is installing a new facade in the Art Deco/Streamline Moderne style and I am wondering
  what typefaces would have historically been used during the period. I am hoping
  to use a sans face in all caps as i know this is more in keeping with this particular
  architectural style. It should also present a more contemporary/modern appearance
  rather than a pastiche of the old. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSome
  links to refresh the memory...\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_Moderne\r\nhttp://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Streamline_dir.html"

  body: Dont want to go that broadway/paris/cafe route. I'm thinking of something
    like Futura, as it's of the right era and can still look contemporary if set right.
    Did Streamline Moderne and the Bauhaus connect?
