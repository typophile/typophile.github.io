  logo?  I've never seen this before.  And if it's wrong to post a site, I apologize
  ahead of time.

    would say it's custom work, derived from something like Chalet or pretty much
    any other rounded sans.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.thebignoob.com/cms/images/blog-neubix.jpg\">Larger
    and better quality pic here...</a></em>"
