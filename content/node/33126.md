  body: It looks like it was once set in Times (or Times New Roman) Bold, then got
    scanned in and autotraced in Illustrator or something.

  body: "That \"R\" (which is clearly mangled) might reinforce the De Vinne\r\nhypothesis,
    since that style has an \"R\" that some people dislike.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It's Trooper Roman, which makes an appearance here now and then.\r\n\r\nThe
    only digital version of the non-Black Trooper that I'm aware of is Paratype's
    <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/asearch/default.asp?search=troover&params=1\"
    target=\"_blank\">Troover</a>.\r\n\r\nEdit: Well, that is NOT a perfect match.
    Sorry. A bit closer would be a version of Trooper Roman Black manually condensed.
    Digitally, this would include Fontbank's <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/talon.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Talon Bold</a> (not the greatest quality and with a tilted 'O')
    and <a href=\"http://www.castletype.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Castle's</a>
    <a href=\"http://www.castletype.com/catalog.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trooper Roman</a>
    - which, for some reason, appears in his PDF catalog, but nowhere else on his
    website. I know of nothing closer and look forward to someone else solving this."
