  Chaparral and New Caledonia as header and body typefaces:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts-article1_3980.png]\r\n\r\nI
  know advice to this kind of question usually goes like, \"Choose whatever suits
  you best or whatever combination pleases you\", but although it pleases me (the
  contrast and feel), I feel a bit unsure as it is quite uncommon a match (and my
  primary job is writing, not design per se).\r\n\r\nSo, does this \"work\", or there
  are nicer options?"

  body: It's not really working for me personally. Is Chaparral horizontally scaled
    here? It looks to be about 5-10% wider. That is part of what doesn't work for
    me. Have you tried looking for a sans with some similarities?

    here.

  body: I guess Bodoni makes matters worse -- too similar to Caledonia to stand out,
    too thin etc. I've tried Myriad and it seems to blend nicely with New Caledonia
    (except if I were to use the latter for titles and sections, too).

  body: Personally, I think Bulmer (bold) would work well as the header font here.

  body: "@altsan, \r\nBulmer does look perfect! I'd never heard of it, looks like
    \"Bodoni meets Baskerville\". \r\nI'm even considering using it for text.\r\n\r\nHere
    is Bulmer with New Caledonia:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts-article3_6399.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is Bulmer for text and headings:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts-article4_4776.png]\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, it is OK to use Bulmer (or any other modern typeface) with old style
    figures?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I only just discovered Bulmer myself, as I've lately bought and have been
    reading Lawson's \"Anatomy of a Typeface\", which has a chapter on it.  I do believe
    it's the first \"modern roman\" that doesn't make me want to claw my eyes out
    when used in running text. <g>  When you said Bodoni would be too \"thin\" it
    occured to me that Bulmer's more gentle contrast might be just the thing.  \r\n\r\n(Goudy
    Modern might also work, but I've got no samples of that to look at.)"
