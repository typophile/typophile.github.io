body: "Hi, I am working on a design that needs some hand painted / brush letters.\r\n\r\nI
  found a sample, that has a nice blend of thick and thin. And irregularities, which
  makes me think it is   hand lettered.  Could anyone recommend a font with a similar
  flavor?\r\n\r\nI found one font, plz-print. Its alright.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outsidetheline/plz-print-brush/\r\n\r\nMaybe
  I'd have more success finding a font as a template and painting my own letters on
  top of the guide.\r\n\r\nWell, any thoughts would be well appreciated.\r\n-=Bookie"

    14 (Strange, Distressed Scripts)</a> of the Script Font ID Guide might show you
    some fonts that would have the feel you are after. Linotype Seven is in there,
    but there are many others with the rough hand-painted look, and some are free
    fonts. (The Guide has no fonts, but its Reference List tells you where they came
    from). \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
