body: "Hi All,\r\nI am trying to create the branding of a social network \"Momment\"
  that allows us to share our moments with people we chose to. While the idea revolves
  around using the two \"m\" to show fusion, connectivity and bond, I am at a dead
  end choosing a typeface. \r\n\r\nI would ideally want the typeface to be warm, human,
  emotional, honest, sincere, personal, interaction. Based on these, I feel a humanist
  font might suit perfectly. The conversations you have with your friends will be
  very personal and warm but people not in the group of conversation will not be seeing
  your conversation with friends of other group. So there needs to be that feeling
  too.\r\n\r\nI would want the brand to reflect gravity and feel iconic yet have these
  above feelings.\r\nWould love to know of some fonts which have above qualities and
  fit well within the idea that I am going ahead with.\r\n\r\nI know this might not
  be the best place for it, but this project is ver close to me so had to ask. I am
  essentially a UI Designer and not the best when it comes to typography.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help if you can.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mommment_3954.png]"

    photographs of people's \"moments in life\", perhaps for an advertising campaign.
    Thus, I thought of a semibold script face. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/aphrodite-pro/|Aphrodite]]
    is something like what came to my mind.\r\n\r\nClearly, that's not what you would
    want - and, it seems that the typeface used in your image is one suitable to your
    purpose.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo-dos/|Camingo
    Dos]], as a random example, would be an alternative to Gill Sans for your purpose.
    Another one would be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/barmeno-bq/|Barmeno]],
    which would avoid using Peignot Bold, which would be cliched at this time.\r\n\r\nThese,
    though, are just random examples."

  body: "I am exploring all possibilities. One of the most cliche' choice could have
    been picking a handwritten font to show personal, and connected human moments.
    Another one would have been to use hourglass, eye etc for logo than a logotype.
    \r\nThis is I believe the harder and the less obvious path. Hence looking at it.
    While I would want it to be iconic and distinct enough to be noted in the viewers
    mind. Something similar to how facebook's font is just a bit distinct and not
    casual/surprisingly distinct.\r\nAny suggestions?"
