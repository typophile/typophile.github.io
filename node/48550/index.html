		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your reply, Bill. You&rsquo;re right, should have been more specific, but my knowledge in the field does not lend me much help. I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily referring to a specific Bible - I am just looking for a font that would have similar characteristics to a typeface used to set a Bible in, say 400 years ago. A couple of your suggestions could get me started in the right direction. For example, would a Jenson be consistent? Is it the right period, the right feel, etc?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Florian, that is a stupendous example.</p>
<p>Dan, Jenson is a very good idea, but the only Bibles I know of printed in a related typeface are the famous Oxford Lectern Bible of 1935, which is printed in a special 22 pt cut of Centaur called I think Bible Centaur, and the famous Doves Bible.</p>
<p>Regarding the Doves Bible, it was said</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The noblest book to look at that was ever printed. The openings of the Books are admirably contrived with a woodcut initial in red; but the want of chapters and verses limits the use of the edition and the lines are really too long&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comments on The Doves Bible taken from: P.J.W, Kilpatrick, ed. Catalogue of the Edward Clark Library, Edinburgh, Napier College of Commerce and Technology, 1976., p.233&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is a most interesting digital reconstruction of the first page here:</p>
<p><a href="http://home.swipnet.se/~w-10011/Tobbe/large/dove.pdf">http://home.swipnet.se/~w-10011/Tobbe/large/dove.pdf</a></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine why the lettering at the top is so uneven &ndash; it was not so in the original printing.</p>
<p>The Doves Type reconstruction from Ohlsson seems to be difficult to get ahold of &ndash; I have an unreleased version of my own.</p>
<p>Of easily available types, you could try Monotype Centaur, which is easy to find as it comes bundled with Microsoft Office. A similar type with considerably more flexibility but with some annoying showy quirks is Adobe Jenson MM, which is no longer sold but which should be findable. Somewhat less flexible but still worth a good look is the current Adobe opentype version.</p>
<p>To give an impression of age, you may want to look at a somewhat distressed type. A fabulous example of subtle distressing is Matthew Carter&rsquo;s revival of Monticello. That is very typical of American 18 and 19th century printing &ndash; somewhere along the line a Bible must have been set in it.</p>
<p>Another fabulous type showing deliberate distress quirks is Monotype Bell, which is also included with Microsoft Office. I believe that Bell has been used historically to set both Bibles and Books of Common Prayer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a start!</p>
<p>Oh - - lest I forget - - there is yet another modern Jenson interpretation included with Microsoft Office that is well worth looking at &ndash; the rather heavy Font Bureau font High Tower. This leans more closely to Doves than to Centaur and is just superb.</p>
<p>The nice thing about so many of these types is that you most likely already have them.</p>
<p>If you are interested in blackletter, the Scangraphic font by Volker Küster &lsquo;Lutherisches Fraktur&rsquo; is well worth a look, and the famous type historian James Mosley has a version that is astonishingly readable. There are many other fabulous blackletter designs, including some 20th century designs that are relatively easy to read.</p>
<p>Have a look at some of these suggestions and let us know if they seem at all what you are looking for. There are many, many other possibilities. There have been so many countless settings of the Bible . . . . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jenson and relatives seem a bit wrong to me, inasmuch as it was originally designed for (and inspired by handwritten) <em>secular</em> texts. As I understand it, those humanist letterforms were closely associated with Classical literature, while bibles and the like retained the blackletter form for quite a long while.</p>
<p>Of course, as noted above, that eventually changed, so if you&rsquo;re looking for something besides blackletter, you may simply need to alter the date of your historical inspiration to suit your aesthetics! ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t think so. Jenson&rsquo;s own type has the dot quite alarmingly, by modern standards, placed to the right. Slimbach has acceded to modern taste by placing the dot where we expect to find it. However, moving the dot to the right wouldn&rsquo;t help you, in this layout.

Here it is with the changes you suggested. I make the right serif of the &ldquo;i&rdquo; smaller and moved the last b away from it (just a tad). It looks better to me. But maybe I&rsquo;ve been staring at it for too long.</p>

I see what you mean. And believe me, I&rsquo;ve experimented with that. The open book graphic does support the tagline better if I move it under the type, but I lose the interesting interactions with the letter, which you mentioned. I did a quick print test at a small size, like on a letterhead, and it seemed fine. I don&rsquo;t imagine it will be used at a much smaller size than that.</div>

I did try the Fell Types - that was actually my first choice - but for some reason, when I installed them (i use Win) in the font folder, my system went crazy. I restarted a couple of times and things were still not right. As soon as I deleted the Fell Type fonts, things were back to normal&hellip; Thank you for your suggestions though.</div>

I understand what you mean. In my thinking, it does not look like the entire book, but only the top of it. In this sense, you&rsquo;re not seeing the cover (and the binding), but only the outline of the pages where the book is opened. The cut letters beneath that outline are the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the book.</p>
<p>@Craig
Will work on your suggestion, but I&rsquo;m not sure I understand the final part of your comment. Would you please explain?</p>

<p>also has the descending J which led me to link the Mediaeval-Egyptienne of the Bauer type foundry with the Petit Mediaeval Clarendon used in the Cambridge Cameo Bible and other Bibles from them.</p>
<p>That face was also 25J from Lanston Monotype</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I find it difficult to decide what is what for the old Cushings and the digital ITC Cushing. Here is what Adobe has to say about ITC Cushing:
&mdash;start quote&mdash;
In 1897, J. Stearns Cushing designed a typeface called Cushing No. 2 for American Type Founders. Frederic W. Goudy added the italic in 1904, and ATF released a variety of other loosely related faces bearing the Cushing name. International Typeface Corporation licensed the typefaces from ATF, and designer Vincent Pacella redrew the typefaces into a consistent family. ITC Cushing, released in 1982, has a fairly large x-height and linear serifs that are a revision of the original sloping serifs. It has four weights plus matching italics.
&mdash;end quote&mdash;
ITC Cushing is low contrast. I wonder if the old Cushing Monotone was even lower contrast?

<p>Well, <em>that</em> question is not difficult to answer, given that the relevant specimen books are available on the Web:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cush_m_atf1900_6076.jpg]</p>
<p>It is also low contrast, but not no contrast. Unlike Lining Cushing No. 2:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lincush2_atf1912_4275.jpg]</p>
<p>What struck me as odd is that ITC Cushing is more condensed than Cushing Old Style, as shown above. However, the version shown in the 1912 ATF specimen book is about the same - but that may not mean the face was changed, just that I&rsquo;m looking at larger point sizes, which are easier to use as masters:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/co2_atf1912_4170.jpg]</p>
<p>This is Cushing Oldstyle No. 2, in the 42 point size.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the further info. I can definitely see the difference. 
As for point sizes, I do know that the ATF of that era was a pioneer in adjusting font contours so that at small point sizes the letters had less contrast and perhaps were wider. ATF did not merely scale the font, unlike much of the first generation of digital fonts, which as a result of optical scaling, are very poor for book size use. I recall reading some articles on this, but I can&rsquo;t recall where.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I remember reading in various general references on the history of type that ATF did make faces wider and bolder in smaller sizes.</p>
<p>I have personally deduced, from looking at the ATF specimen book, and from information in the classic book Typographic Printing-Surfaces (Legros) that ATF would have had to make tiny adjustment to the width of letters in each point size in any case, as they made all their types in integral multiples of 1/4 point in width in order to facilitate justification.</p>
<p>However, this did not lead me to conclude that ATF was a pioneer in making these adjustments. Linn Boyd Benton pioneered in using the pantograph, and made those adjustments from the beginning in his use of the pantograph. But, as another Typophile thread noted in a quotation from a French-language reference, smaller=wider (and, thus, I presume also bolder) was true during the pre-pantograph era of actually cutting punches as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indeed, saying &ldquo;the ATF of that era was a pioneer in adjusting font contours&rdquo; is misleading because before the ATF&rsquo;s pantograph all sizes were cut individually anyway! ATF did implement something called &ldquo;cutting slips&rdquo; that &ldquo;algorithmically&rdquo; optimized the pantographic cutting from the large masters in order to optimize for size, but eventually largely stopped bothering with size-specific optimization, to cut costs.</p>
