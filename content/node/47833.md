    is, so I defer to Stephen's knowledge. Sometimes, both names might be valid, because
    they are two different versions of a typeface based on the same model (if it was
    in metal first, say). There are many examples of revivals today that are like
    that. Mark Simonson in [[http://www.typophile.com/node/15379|this thread]] thought
    it was possible that Chopin was the original name and that Phil Martin renamed
    his version of it, so who really knows?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    \ It is no different than copying any other copyrighted material, which I am unfortunately
    also familiar with.  For example, my partner is a photographer, and shot a gig
    for a magazine at a restaurant.  Said magazine signed a contract for these images
    for editorial use.  The next month, the restaurant \"borrowed\" one of the images
    from the magazine for an ad it was running in that magazine. And when contacted,
    couldnt understand the problem! \r\n\r\nIt's absolutely maddening.  Because although
    there is technically recourse, for someone on their own, it's next to impossible.
