body: "Hey everybody!\r\n\r\nI've been struggling with my own corporate image recently.
  I feel as though I've HIT my logo which is in Helvetica, but can't seem to find
  a typeface for the body text. Although it may seem weird to say, I'm not a fan of
  helvetica as a body text. Not because it doesn't work, but I feel that I've seen
  it a trillion times used badly, and it seems just so standard.\r\n\r\nI've been
  using APEX Sans as my body text for my current image. I have to say, I really enjoy
  the way its working for me.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to marry Helvetica as my logo
  and Apex as my body text. They are very differant SANS, but I forget is Sans+Sans
  is a no-no & wanted to see what masters (you guys) say.\r\n\r\nAlso, feel free to
  comment on the card design. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance for the much needed
  help! :)\r\n\r\n"

    Helvetica is so often used and seen that it does not create an identity. What
    is it about you as a designer that is unique and what face speaks to that?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Well I chose helvetica because I'm a one person & freelance designer, so
    I feel that keeping a simplistic logo might reflect that I am a smaller company.
    The opposite of a giant corporation. Maybe this direction isn't as strong as it
    should be. \r\n\r\nWhat makes me unique as a designer is my italian heritage,
    which I try to market (there is an E at the end of my name.. Davide). Everyone
    always thinks thats very cool. At the same time, I don't want to SCREAM that there
    is an e in my name by making it another color or something.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the feedback so far! I really need to get this done SOON!\r\n\r\nI remember seeing
    Addison hall http://addisonhalldesign.com/ on typophile and I really like his
    work and Identity. I like the typeface he uses also is great. I like his simplistic
    approach as well. Website is great too! :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Again, what is it about you that you want to convey? Right now, it seems
    you are a bit timid about what that might be. Regarding the Italian angle, why
    does that matter to your clients? Identity is about defining who you are, what
    you would like to convey about yourself, and then reflecting that visually. It
    is a design problem. How would you design an identity for a client?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
