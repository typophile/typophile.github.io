body: "Hi folks,\r\nI'm looking for a display face that was pretty popular in the
  70's and early 80's. It's a script style font with ligatures and exaggerated ascenders
  and descenders. The closest thing I can compare it to is Dorchester. I feel like
  it's something one would see on a bank or hotel sign from that era. Any help would
  be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nPS -I've tried searching all over for examples,
  but as soon as I need something I can never find it. C'est la vie."
