  subject, be it website links, be it books, be it names.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n"

    precisely where it was) some images of type inspired furniture. \r\n\r\n I've
    already browsed throw these threads before, but Im looking more for interior designers
    / interior architects work if that makes sense at all : )\r\n\r\nAny hints?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDavid"

  body: "Hm, DWR also carries the Neutraface house numbers. I don't think they'd work
    well on a lot of houses, but if I could ever get away with using them, I'd probably
    make them back-lit, as they sit off the surface a bit. \r\nFrom the description,
    they're hollow too, so fitting in lighting wouldn't be so hard."
