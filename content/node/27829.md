  bundle or should I buy a seperate book for each program.\r\n\r\nIvan"

    I tried this site www.totaltraining.com and got this bundle\r\n\r\nhttp://www.totaltraining.com/prod/bundle/creativesuite2_std.asp?mscsid=\r\n\r\nReal
    cool and there is always the manual\r\n\r\nMark"

    online tutorials or forums in case of any problems. Or -worst case scenario- you
    can always read the manual ;-)\r\nFor Photoshop you might want to buy a book if
    you really want to make full use of its capacities (but for basic things, the
    same goes for Photoshop as for Illustrator).\r\nThere's no better (or more fun)
    teacher than curiosity... mixed with a little stamina & interest, that is.\r\nIf
    you're used to working in older versions of these programs, it's just of matter
    of staying up-to-date & the Adobe-site features all the new stuff.\r\nGood luck!"

    and are very solid.\r\n\r\nAlso, I can highly recommend the book \"Photoshop CS2
    for digital photographers\" by Colin Smith - best photo book I've come across.\r\n\r\nFor
    some great insights in the use of Illustrator for typography as well as some excellent
    drawing techniques and shortcuts, read the \"Logo, font and lettering bible\"
    by Leslie Cabarga. "

    books. The videos are much easier to get through than books. A year ago, I transitioned
    a workgroup of 35 people from Quark to InDesign using only Lynda and it worked
    out great. Not to mention the cost of $20 per month is much cheaper than books.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    my experience is that Lynda is much better than Total Training."

  body: The Visual Quickstart Books from Peachpit Press are good for learning and
    quick reference - I tell my students to buy them when they get a job - you can
    not remember everything if you do not use it everyday.

  body: "I still prefer books with detailed indexes in combination with extensive
    use of colored pencils for underlining and marginal notes and comments, because
    this way it's possible to re-find special tricks even after some time has passed.
    So for InDesign I can recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321322029/sr=8-3/qid=1156286584/ref=sr_1_3/102-9381537-2953704?ie=UTF8\">Real
    World Adobe InDesign CS2</a> by Olav Martin Kvern and David Blatner. \r\nNice
    as well, e.g. as reminders, are <a href=\"http://www.senecadesign.com/designgeek/indesign.html\">tips
    via email</a> now and then, the corresponding discussions are even more interesting.
    There is a link to an <a href=\"http://www.indesignsecrets.com/category/podcasts/\">InDesign
    podcast</a> as well in case you like podcasts.\r\n\r\nFor beginners I'd second
    the \"Classroom in a Book\" series mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow everybody, thanks!\r\n\r\nFreelanceren\r\nI like what this site has to
    offer and I'm sure it's a great resource. But I just spent alot of cash buying
    Adobe CS2 legitimately instead of bootlegging it and I need additional cash to
    buy myself a decent font library. Perhaps someday when my budget permits it I'll
    buy a few videos.\r\n\r\nIll Sans\r\nI agree wholeheartedly about self training
    through experimentation. It's how I learned Illustrator. But my photoshop is weak
    at best, and I have no expirience with Indesign whatsoever. I want to learn as
    much as possible in the quickest amount of time and i think a book or two will
    do the trick. At least with a book, I can alway take it with me and read thru
    it when I have the time (like on my lunch break at work. Heck, even during work
    while I'm sitting on my desk.) What online forums do you suggest I visit?\r\n\r\nTermopolium\r\nI've
    heard good things about the \"Classroom in a book\" series and it's one of my
    top choices. I will definately check out \u201CPhotoshop CS2 for digital photographers\u201D
    by Colin Smith since I would like to learn more about retouching and perhaps get
    into digital photography. I agree 100% about the \u201CLogo, font and lettering
    bible\u201D by Leslie Cabarga that's why I bout a copy:)\r\n\r\nFisheye\r\nThank
    you so much for putting me on to this site! It's a great resource and the prices
    are very good. I'm thinking about purchasing their \"InDesign Professional Typography\"
    DVD.\r\n\r\nBojev\r\nYou're right about not remembering everything which is why
    I'd like to purchase a book. I'll checkout your suggestions.\r\n\r\nTina\r\nI've
    also heard good things about the \"Real world\" series. And I've already bookmarked
    the Seneca design site. Great resource!\r\n\r\nGracias Todos!\r\nIvan"

  body: "Mister M,\r\n\r\nI use books and the web depending on the situation i'm in.
    \ The web is unbeatable if you troubleshooting a specific problem, but I find
    that books are nicer for conceptual, or instructional content.  Good books have
    excellent indexes, and personally I like printed pages as opposed to screen.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure about the rest of the bundle, but Ben Willmore has published  <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321321898/sr=1-3/qid=1156390619/ref=sr_1_3/002-6628514-3561600?ie=UTF8&s=books\">Photoshop
    CS2 - studio techniques</a> \r\n\r\nI shopped around and read a stack of threads
    and reviews before I bought this one, and it really payed off.\r\n\r\nIt is honestly
    a fantastic book. Can't speak highly enough of it.  Ben is really good at making
    seemingly complicated topics seem easy.  He doesnt offer scores of pointless 'PS
    effects' tutorials, but rather explains how each tool/technique works and put
    them into context to real applications.  It's deep too!  He covers a lot of ground.

  body: "I\u2019m going to second Tina\u2019s recommendation for \u201CReal World
    Adobe InDesign CS2\u201D by Kvern and Blatner. Blatner and Concepci\xF3n\u2019s
    podcasts are very informative, and they do answer e-mailed questions! Hands on
    training, although potentially expensive, is an option I\u2019d seriously consider.
    The \u201CClassroom in a Book\u201D series, while well done, covers the basics
    and doesn\u2019t go much further.\r\n\r\nAlso by the same group, try \u201CReal
    World Adobe Photoshop CS2\u201D by Fraser & Blatner and \u201CReal World Image
    Sharpening with Adobe Photoshop CS2\u201D by Bruce Fraser. I\u2019d also recommend
    reading \u201CReal World Color Management, Second Edition\u201D by Bruce Fraser,
    Chris Murphy, and Fred Bunting. Do check out Nigel French\u2019s \u201CInDesign
    Type: Professional Typography with Adobe InDesign CS2\u201D, which addresses the
    core of print collateral, that being well set text.\r\n\r\nAbove all, have patience;
    this is a complex group of programs you are embarking on learning. It takes time
    to learn them at an expert level. \u2014Bill Lomax\r\n"
