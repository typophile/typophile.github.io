body: "i'd like to use some type inspired by antique maps for a branding project and
  this is a good example of the typography i'd like to use. i like the contrast between
  thick and thin much like bodoni or didot, but the serifs extend out a bit further
  and are a bit more wedge-like. can some one help me find something pretty close
  to this?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\naustin taylor[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maptext_6058.jpg]"
