    stated that there would be no universal binary for Intel Macs until CS3. We've
    all been following this closely!

    many would point to the Island of Sans Serifa hoax, but perhaps the history can
    be traced back to Guttenberg himself hoaxing the look of hand written bibles. "

    Johnny-G-Good rather straightforward about the benefits and coolness of his new

    looked like instead?"

    don't think so, it was in his economic interest to keep the technology secret

    he wanted them to know it was something new. The Church was very interesting in
    printing, because you could certify a master translation, and only print that.
    And Gutenberg must have been very interested in the Church. Whatta market!\r\n\r\nGutenberg's
    acutal printing career only lasted about 10 or 15 years, I think (it depends on
    whether you think he invented printing earlier, while living in Strasbourg, or
    after he had already returned home to Mainz). Didn't the colophon of one of his
    later books attribute its production to the magical art of printing, or something
    like that?"
