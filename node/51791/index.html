<p>Indeed; towards a separation of the two edges of the black. The paradox is that Dwiggins was majorly chirographic! Maybe he didn&rsquo;t realize the true nature of what he had discovered. He did have incredible instincts though.</p>

<p>I think you do WAD a bit of disservice by referring to his instincts, though. He thought everything through and was endlessly experimental. He ended up places through thought.</p>
<p>More to our original point, he was involved in every level of the production and wanted to know about the process and the technology. What I&rsquo;m getting at is that while his roots (and, perhaps, his  instincts) were chirographic his experiments and interest in the production process probably led him away from purely chirographic forms.</p>

That&rsquo;s how I reconcile it or, more properly, explain it. He explored some hypotheses and found them incorrect.</p>
<p>In the case you cite, he wondered if Uncial forms would be more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; for the reading of English, thinking that the Latin forms would be better suited for, well, Latin presumably, and I guess the romance languages..  So he experimented to see if Winchester Uncial would yield revolutionary results in legibility in setting English. It didn&rsquo;t and he said so, but Winchester without the uncial forms is actually a really charming face and he did some great work in Hingham with it. I don&rsquo;t think the digital versions really do it justice.</p>
<p>Truly, Hrant, WAD was a kindred soul to you. He worried about and was involved in every step of type production; he took careful consideration of legibility AND readability; he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to explore radical ideas (including the abandonment of many chirographic forms).</p>
<p>[As an aside, weren&rsquo;t uncial forms originally Roman anyway and brought to the British Isles during the Roman occupation? They may have then hit an artistic peak as Insular majascule etc,&hellip; but it seems like WAD was really off base on that one.]</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;ve long thought that uncials would work great as caps for the conventional lc (because the classical caps -as august as they are- are really so foreign to the more important lc). But maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad having two styles in one alphabet (at least when it comes to text). Well, <em>three</em> styles if you count numerals!  :-/</p>

<p>Back in [[http://typophile.com/node/41365|this thread]] I quoted Dwiggins from 1947, suggesting the answer then would be no:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A type face is good if it is easy to read. No concession that interferes with ease of reading may be made either to beauty of appearance or to mechanical felicity. Legibility is the basic law, the sine qua non.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan (BlueStreak) &ndash; When asked what style I thought should be used here, I had originally thought one of the heavier condensed [newspaper headline] styles. I also thought maybe one of the heavier italics, which get funky and chunky (Cyrus called them &ldquo;tasty&rdquo;). But after that rich, chewy Beorcana, I thought in the end that something light and airy might be a nice change, and so I suggested the Light Italic.</p>
<p>Hrant &ndash; I was being only half-serious (and taking you only half-seriously), thus the smiley. No worries.</p>
<p>Regarding WAD, I think I would agree with that he was very instinctive in his work. And at the same time, he was very thoughtful. I think his thinking tended to follow his instincts. He could indeed be very right in his instincts and at the same time amazingly off-base in some of his ideas. But that is part of being a great thinker.</p>
<p>Dwiggins was a complicated mix of thinking and feeling, contemporary urges and historical respect. He even makes fun of himself in this regard through his alter-ego, H. Püterschein. In the Caledonia specimen, in &ldquo;Notes on the Designer&rdquo; Dwiggins-as-Püterschein writes about Dwiggins-the-designer, protesting that he is not really very &ldquo;modern&rdquo; at all:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He creates an illusion of machines. But his machines are a masquerade. There are men inside of them. [. . .] Dwiggins pretends to love steel. He deceives nobody who <em>thinks</em> steel. He deceives his friends &ndash; Victorians like himself. He does not deceive <em>me</em>. . . . Dwiggins loves the forms of his youth &ndash; split-rail fences, the dust of the road, shady farm-lanes, hills, clouds, sunshine, rain, a simple breed of semi-barbaric rural morons &ndash; all the sentimental hogwash of the days when he was young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a complicated and contradictory man.</p>

<p>Christian, I think it&rsquo;s overstating the case to say that Griffith &ldquo;struggled to pull him back.&rdquo; WAD was always concerned about the commercial viability of what he did. That didn&rsquo;t stop him from experimenting at all. But he was also always saying to Griff &ndash; You tell me if there&rsquo;s any value in continuing this, or just put it &ldquo;in the attic&rdquo; (as he would say).</p>
<p>Thing is, as evidenced by the Charter and Winchester examples you mentioned, he was always pulling things back out of the attic and dusting off pet ideas, revisiting them again and again. You know . . . so many ideas, so little time.</p>
<p>But hey, it&rsquo;s a good thing he didn&rsquo;t have to draw every size and style and cast everything all himself, right? Or it might have taken him four years to release one family too ;-)</p>

<p>My main point was that when we struggle to reconcile a man both instinctive and deliberate, it&rsquo;s not really THAT contradictory. His instincts led him to want to try out many things (some fairly outlandish) and he then experimented, displaying his deliberate and thoughtful nature. We can snort in derision at some ideas, but that&rsquo;s always the case looking at experimental pioneers of the past.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christian &ndash; Agreed.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Griff respected both aspects of Dwiggins equally. He obviously admired WAD&rsquo;s talent and creative impulses. He also respected WAD&rsquo;s analyses and theories. He was often asking WAD&rsquo;s opinion about other faces in production or sending him articles to comment on.</p>
<p>He did not always agree with all of WAD&rsquo;s theories. (I&rsquo;m thinking about the long debate regarding approaches to fitting that I alluded to in another thread.) And I think CHG undoubtedly felt that some of WAD&rsquo;s design experiments were pretty outlandish, being a pretty practical man himself. But clearly, he felt that there was great value in having someone relatively unfettered in the MLCo camp doing the equivalent of &ldquo;R&amp;D.&rdquo; In this regard, I think Griff deserves a lot of credit for being quite visionary.</p>
