  serifs on this Bluenote cover\r\n\r\nthe typeface used for the artists names seems
  similar to Trade or Franklin gothic \u2013 but the \"G\"  is clearly different\r\n\r\nI
  can't find any match for the the fat bold type..\r\n\r\nMany thanks!  \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JohnPatton_LetEmRoll_6551.jpg]"

    I can come up with are:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness/ [you'd
    have to edit the angled terminals]\r\nhttps://commercialtype.com/typefaces/giorgio/sans
    [Heavy; edit the spur on the G]\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/styles/
    [68 Full Featherweight; edit the R]"

    it is more likely that it is Monotype Grotesque:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/\r\n\r\nAktiv
    Grotesk is also an option:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/dalton_maag/aktiv_grotesk_corporate_regular_ot/"

  body: "For the artists names, I'm probably wrong and even if it sounds weird, I
    see Arial, distorted a bit. For title, I'd have said something close/like Alternate
    Gothic but many details are off and mainly /J over curved terminal. Best one I
    could get is [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview|Knockout]] (from
    No. 66 to 68) using the alternate /R (as seen [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/characters/knockoutno-68fullfeatherweight|here]]).
    Still searching.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Seeing now Kevin took the same track with Knockout
    so probably not so bad. But nothing about Arial..."
