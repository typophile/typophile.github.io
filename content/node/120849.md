  cacao milkshakes.\r\n\r\nHere i have some images of the main logo:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6325.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/proj_logo_648_3440.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  there is one with the brand emblem, a boy with a bottle and a bag:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/project_cover_3672.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you all, guys!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nYou are right, guys. It's a similar variant
  of the \"Coca-Cola\" font.\r\nOn the \"kthomps5\" links you can find Coca-Cola font
  is a combination of \"American Pop One\" and \"American Pop Two\".\r\nIn my case,
  Cacaolat is only American Pop One, corresponding at the \"Coca\" from \"Coca-Cola\",
  so the font has been found.\r\nThank you all, and thank you kthomps5 for the links!"
