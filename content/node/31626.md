    the data is difficult to get to, and you should allow a few years for sales momentum
    to build. Another option is peer recognition; competitions, awards, and the like.
    So, with apologies for any I may have forgotten, the TDC has awarded: \r\nNassim
    by Titus Nemeth, \r\nTisa by Mitja Miclavcic, \r\nCalouste by Miguel Sousa, \r\nMaiola
    \ by Veronika Burian, \r\nNoam by Adi Stern, \r\nGentium by Victor Gaultney, and\r\nRayuela
    by Alejandro lo Celso. \r\n\r\nThe Creative Review also awarded student projects:
    Veronika's Maiola and Malou Verlomme's Ficus. \r\n\r\nNot strictly an answer to
    your question, but laudable nevertheless is the work of Tim Ahrens, which has
    garnered considerable recognition while Tim is a part-time student. \r\n\r\nAnd,
    attempting foresight, I am sure that David Cabianca's Cardea will turn many heads
    when it is eventually released. \r\n"

  body: "\"Can someone tell me the name some famous typefaces were released/designed
    when the designer was a student.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone's already asked how famous,
    and I'm wondering at the definition of student*, but both these fellows were enrolled
    at RISD when they designed these faces and probably more for the last named:\r\nFF
    Providence, Guy Jeff Nelson\r\nFF Dolores, Tobias Frere-Jones\r\n\r\nA little
    math indicates that one (*besides Knuth), must've been born after 1960, (or perhaps
    before 1640), and, before about 1980, to up-to-now have designed a font that became
    famous while they were in school. This may be further limited, as the glut of
    new designs made even the best school projects drown in the many-to-be-marketed
    by around 2000, (2000 - 22yrs.old - 2 yrs. marketing to make famous font = 1976
    birth). bringing the range of possible fame in fonts in school to but 16 possible
    graduating classes. On the other side, one could not study with a public type
    design product until 1987 at the earliest, (- 22yrs.old - 2 yrs. marketing = 1963
    birth) bringing the possible years down to 13 for anyone who adopted Fontographer
    as early as 1987...\r\n\r\n...so I'd be interested in how many you find.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    first one was at age 14 or 15, like Christian. He partnered with his pal Tim Glaser
    on many of the early typefaces. His earlier faces were GarageFonts releases like
    Diva, OUT, and Locus, and Index and Profundus a bit later.\r\n\r\nI was working
    at GF circa 1999-2000 when <em>Time</em> magazine chose Index to appear on the
    front cover of one of their special issues. That was a huge deal, as they rarely
