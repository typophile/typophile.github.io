  finally post a question that' s been burning my lips for some time now...\r\n\r\nI
  found this typeface in a novel ( Con Sordino by Knut Hamsun, translated into Dutch
  ) in my father' s attic.\r\nSince I loved it instantly ( the typeface that is )
  I started looking for it everywhere, but couldn' t find anything similar at first.\r\nThe
  printers - Zuid-Hollandse Boek en Handelsdrukkerij - seems to be out of business,
  so no luck there.\r\n\r\nHowever, a search on certain designers of that period -
  I assumed it was a late 19th- early 20th century Typeface - came up with a pretty
  similar type, namely Helga Antiqua in a pdf file about the Stempel Foundry ( downloadable
  here: http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/ChronikStempel.pdf , see page 5 )\r\nIn
  the ( pdf- ) text, it says \" 1911 - Von Professor F. W. Kleukens wird die Helga-Antiqua
  herausgegeben... \" and the name \" Helga-Antiqua \" is printed alongside.\r\nTo
  me, it seems to be a very close match ...\r\n\r\nNow here' s my question(s) :\r\n-
  IS it indeed Helga Antiqua ?\r\n- Who designed it ? Was it Kleuskens or is it an
  older typeface that he \" revived \" - maybe with a new name ? \r\n- Who owns the
  design today ? \r\n- I couldn' t find any digital version of it . Does any of you
  know about one ?\r\n\r\nAs it is a nice and very readable Typeface, I am thinking
  of creating something similar in digital form.\r\nWhat about the legal issues ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  to all for looking into this,\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: "I think you have identified it correctly. The Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type
    Faces' shows Helga and says it is also known as Olga. It credits F. W. Kleukens
    as the designer, and gives 'Stempel, 1912' as the original foundry, but also lists
    Ensched\xE9, which is Dutch.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the type sample in the book
    is not the complete typeface, but it does match the letters in your sample.\r\n\r\n-

    \"a\" familiar) and it is indeed Helga-Antiqua. It was released by the D. Stempel
    typefoundry in Frankfurt Am Main. It seems it was also mdistributed through Ensched\xE9
    (Dutch). I'm not sure if it's ever been digitized though?\r\n\r\nAlso see more

  body: "Mike and Stefan, thanks to both of you for the replies ( haven' t been in
    front of my computer again today until now ... )\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this book
    last year and had been looking for the Typeface using different sources, but only
    found the pdf- file about Stempel last week and that showed ( what looked to me-
    ) the best match so far.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I started digitizing it last
    year and finished the lowercase letters so far ( didn' t have time to do the uppercase
    yet + I wanted more info on the designer and of course its whereabouts )\r\n\r\nIt
    all merely started as an exercise. \r\nI learned drawing letterforms in my artschool-days
    ( seventies ) using a proper pencil and paper, but wanted to try something digital
    now. I bought FontLab' s TypeTool and ScanFont to do so and I' ve been using vector
    drawing applications for many years ( I' m a freelance illustrator ... )\r\n\r\nAs
    said before, I am thinking of creating a font based on some of its characteristics.\r\nI
    particularly like the shapes of the lowercase \"a\" and \"g\" and also the short
    descenders.\r\nIf I can go on with it, I' d like to create a complete family with
    Italics etc.\r\n\r\nAtached here are the lowercase characters I finished.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minuscel_5404.jpg]"

    only the 'k' looks much different from the sample I have in the Jaspert book.\r\nI'll
    be interested to follow your progress with it. I hope you can keep me posted.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Stefan for looking into your showings of the typeface. I hope you can find a complete
    set.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    it isn' t Helga Antiqua then after all ?\r\nHere' s a sample with the original
    print on top and the one I created below ( don' t mind the kerning, 'cause I didn'
    t fine-tune that yet )\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/falkenberg_6569.jpg]\r\n\r\nEdit:
    as you can see, I did alter the shape of the \"a\" slightly ( more rounded on
    top ) "

  body: "I will try to make a scan of the sample from Jaspert. It shows a more open
    'k', to my eye, but it does say it is Helga Antiqua, and the other letters are
    nearly identical. It's possible the print quality or type size might be different,
    and so the details may be slightly different too. In metal types there are often
    point size differences in letterform details.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Peter, I am just about to send you a higher resolution scan. I think the
    word spacing in the Jaspert sample was removed to allow more letters to be shown,
    so I do not think that is realistic spacing.\r\n\r\nI still believe the legs of
    the 'k' are joined farther from the stem in that sample than in your letter, but
    it could be an attribute of a larger point size than your book showed.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Just for an interesting comparison, have a look at Letraset <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carlton/carlton/charmap.html\">Carlton</a>,
    which is an adaptation of Ehmke Antiqua designed in 1908. In some ways Helga Antiqua
    resembles what might have happened if one decided to use Ehmke as the basis for
    a text typeface. The 'g' is the most glaring difference that jumps out.\r\n\r\nAnother
    comparison is another face designed by Kleukens for Bauer, around 1900-1908, originally
    known as Kleukens Antiqua, but digitized by Scangraphic as <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/trieste-sb/\">Trieste</a>.
    Notice it's similarities with Helga, including the G and g resemblances.\r\n\r\n-

    interested in I can ask if the matrizes are still existing. I am dealer of Schriften-Service

    Koch Antiqua, 48 p some weeks ago (its not officially listed, too.)\r\n\r\nThe
