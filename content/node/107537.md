  body: "The sans serif (\"North End\") incorporates elements of art-nouveau faces
    like Hobo and art-deco faces like Kabel, but it's not a font. It's hand-painted,
    and very nicely, too. The man's clothes and hairstyle, and the National Beer sign
    on the right, date this photo to the early or middle 1960s, when hand-painting
    would have been the most practical means of putting letters this size on a pane
    of glass. The North End Lounge was a jazz club at 1869 North Gay St. in Baltimore.
    Here's what that address looks like now. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/northend_4778.jpg]"
