  body: This is an old font called Desdemona. It&#39;s been slanted in this instance.
    There is a digital version called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/"
    target="_blank">Quaint Gothic</a> by Jim Spiece.

  body: I could have sworn there was a Desdemona that was distributed with certain
    Microsoft Products such as Office. I think it was somehow related to the Font
    Bureau but I&#39;m not sure, I&#39;ll have to check when I get home.

  body: Yes, there was a Font Bureau version of Desdemona that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=92&amp;FNAME=Desdemona&amp;FVER=1.51">shipped
    with some Microsoft products</a>. I seem to remember it was an outline version.

  body: There was a package called the &#34;Microsoft True Type Master Set&#34; that
    I bought in 1994, with 102 fonts for the Macintosh. Desdemona outline was one
    of the fonts, with a writeup almost identical &#40;no specific credits were given&#41;
    to the one in Justin&#39;s post.  <BR> <BR>It is called Quaint Open in the Solotype
    Catalog &#40;p. 184&#41;. The Solotype showing includes some ligatures that were
    not in the TrueType set, and I don&#39;t think they are in the Spiece Graphics
    version either. <BR> <BR>In the Dover book &#34;Treasury of Authentic Art Nouveau
    Alphabets&#34; by Ludwig Petzendorfer, it is shown as the open lettering under
    the name &#39;Desdemona&#39; credited to the foundry of &#34;Karl Brendler &amp;
