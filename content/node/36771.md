    are a few other art forums like eatpoo, but those focus mainly on stuff like fantasy
    art and illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nNiki"

  body: "yayhooray is OK. HOW has a pretty big forum as well. I haven't really participated
    in either in a long while, so can't really speak to much as to the current quality.
    If you are an AIGA member, they also have forums as well, I believe.\r\n\r\nBut,
    yea, Typophile seems to retain a rather consistent, loyal membership of passionate
    type and graphic designers. "

  body: "Now that James has mentioned <strong>Design Observer</strong> I'll throw
    in <strong>Speak Up</strong>... I did not mention them before because their format
    is a bit different from Typophile's (i.e., the authors/editors post articles to
    which people post responses, opinions, arguments, etc.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/\r\n\r\n...and
    from the same folks, <strong>Brand New</strong>:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/"

    <strong>Voice: AIGA Journal of Design</strong>...\r\n\r\nhttp://voice.aiga.org/\r\n\r\n...and
    the latest addition, <strong>A Brief Message</strong>:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.abriefmessage.com/\r\n\r\nAgain,
    these are design blogs, but you can leave comments and start a heated discussion
    if you wish.  :-)"

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\nI'll check these places out. I don't have access to other
    designers like I did when I was younger. I have no time to be a member of an art
    director club. I am an in house designer and we only have one other designer who
    is starting out. I have no peers to get feed back or advice from. I have been
    enjoying this forum. I suppose I will run out of questions soon."

  body: I'm personally excited to see A Brief Message take to flight. In fact, it
    reminds me of the good old days when Design in Flight was around, though the latter
    was an e-zine and not a forum per se. Sadly, I just went to designinflight.com
    and it's been taken over by a shady loan reseller.
