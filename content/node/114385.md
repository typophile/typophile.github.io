  body: "Is this your own drawing? Are you asking us to suggest hand-drawn font styles
    with this kind of J? Or do you want an exact match for this sample?\r\n\r\nPlease
    clarify what you are showing and what you are asking. It makes it easier for us
    not to guess these things. Thanks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

  body: "If you want a hand-drawn font, how about [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontforecast/chameleon/?refby=bowfin|Chameleon
    Basic]]? In looking at script styles that was one of the most similar to your
    shape, I thought. Most J's with a loop on the left also have a lower loop, or
    a more curved tail, and I didn't see any that were completely straight below.\r\n\r\nI'm
    still not sure which style of font you are trying to find. A formal script? A
    casual handwriting font?  If you can be more specific about the style it might
    narrow the search.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n\r\n"
