body: Can anyone help me to identify this typeface please? - The 'Woo Hoo It's World
  Book Day". I'm aware it's probably been letterpresses, but there must be a digital
  version of it somewhere...? I'm a BA Hons Graphic Design student and desperately
  need this font! Any responses would be greatly appreciated!
