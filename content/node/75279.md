  [[http://www.lukelucas.com/|Luke Lucas]].\r\n\r\nAs we can see on his [[http://www.behance.net/Luke_Lucas|Behance
  Page]], he usually starts with vector artworks. \r\nRecently he developed a personal
  \ 3D lettering treatment, including spotlights, shadows and realistic material rendering.\r\n\r\nI
  was wandering if does anyone know the software utililzed for this kind of treatment.\r\n\r\nAre
  these the new Adobe Photoshop 3D features, or is it a 3D modeling software as 3D
  studio MAx or Cinema4d?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n"
