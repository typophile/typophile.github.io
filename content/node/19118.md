  Railways made by our hero Jozef M\xFCller-Brockmann.\r\nI'm sure it should be somewhere
  on the internet but google didn't help me very much!\r\nAnyone knows where to find
  it?\r\n\r\nLoyalty, friendship, commitment\r\n"

  body: "i havent found it until now, if you find it, please leave a note here. as
    you surely know there are some parts of it in books about brockmann,  but thats
    not what you want. \r\n\r\nif i get some free time (after a stressy period ending
    end of april), i'll try to call the SBB (swiss federal railways in german) and
    ask if they'd know any place i could still find it (archives, whatever). but probably
    they wont have anything."
