body: "My girlfriend buys the magazine [[http://www.shoptilyoudrop.com.au|'Shop till
  you drop']] and the other day i saw the cover for the current issue and thought
  'hang on, that's really nice type...' Three of the types used i love but have no
  idea what they are, can someone help please?\r\n\r\nHere is the cover which has
  sample of all the types i'm after (click for larger image) http://www.magshop.com.au/?id=150&CID=10446\r\n\r\nThe
  first is the script used to say 'till you drop' on the logo.\r\n\r\nThe second is
  a sans used for some body copy, headings, and product info.\r\n\r\nThe third is
  a handwriting script used heaps in the mag.\r\n\r\nAny help would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nI
  can try to get scans if needed.\r\n\r\ncheers - sye :)"
