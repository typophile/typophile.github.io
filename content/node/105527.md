  letter 'h' but i just don't get there...tried looking for online tutorials but non
  of them deal with the complexity of a letter (just stars...etc)\r\n\r\nCould someone
  please tell me how to accomplish a nice and clean halftone effect on a letter in
  illustrator the way a half tone should be on type. \r\n\r\nkind regards"

  body: "I'm not sure exactly what effect you're looking for, but something like this
    is simple in Photoshop. Create the letter, rasterize (layer > rasterize > type),
    then apply the mosaic filter (filter > pixelate > mosaic).  Don't know how to
    in Illustrator.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/h4_5405.jpg]"

  body: "I would have thought the OP meant \"screened type.\" In other words, the
    h should print grey (depending how small the dots are).\r\n\r\nYou could always
    get (or make) some vector art of circles (or of the space between the circles),
    put it over the h, and subtract the paths."

    filter)

  body: "Sure no probs, basically this is old school Ps stuff you know blur and then
    hit with the effect 'cept in Illy you have to go from  vector to raster and then
    back to vector using Live Trace.\r\n\r\n1. Type your type.\r\n\r\n2. Blur the
    type ... Effect>Blur>Gaussian Blur ... I set the amount to 10 in both examples.\r\n\r\n3,
    \ Raterize the type ... Object>Rasterize, and in the Dialog box set the ppi on
    High. Using the Custom option and setting the value higher will result in a more
    detail rendering of the blur through the halftone filter resulting in more dots
    ...from 300ppi to 600ppi there is quite a difference. In the above T example I
    used a setting of  600ppi and in the below H example I used a 300 (default High)
    ppi setting.\r\n\r\n4, Apply the Color Halftone Effect ... Effect>Pixelate>Color
    Halftone, and in the Dialog box you can play around with the settings. But in
    both my examples I used a Max Radius of 40, and in the above Arial T I set all
    the Channels to 20 ...in the below Gotham H I set all the Channels to 90. Try
    messing around with the Channel settings to see how the Effect is rendered.\r\n\r\n5.
    \ Vector the Color Halftone ... Object>Live Trace>Make and Expand.\r\n\r\n<img
    src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/TYPOPHILE_halftoneHvector.jpg\">\r\n\r\nAfter
    the Effect is applied you can trim or crop as desired by using the Pathfinder
    options..."
