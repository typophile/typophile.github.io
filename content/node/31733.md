body: "Working on some lettering for some P-O-P signage for a beauty/makeup event
  in our stores. The event is called \"All About Color\". Upscale brands (Dior, Lancome,
  Estee Lauder, Chanel) will be involved with some makeup artists in attendance. This
  logo will go on signs throughout the department.\r\n\r\nI attached some pencil sketches.
  I based some of a Didone, but as you can see I'm trying to make it a little more
  unique than the standard fashion sign.\r\n\r\nAny comments would be welcome. You
  can even say they all stink and start over--I'm a big boy and can take it. TiA.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\nUPDATE:
  Added another round of sketches, based more on scripts (Fling, Coquette). I also
  like the lowercase l I drew (Figure 1) but don't know if I am referencing an existing
  font.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches_6082.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches_2_5250.jpg]"

    with other letters - but you could try it. It looks fun! Any more sketches? '
