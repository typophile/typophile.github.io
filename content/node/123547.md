  collection. Amazing quality.\"  I have a browser extension to identify web-fonts
  which is calling this one \"Frank\" but I can find no font by that name that looks
  like that.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.shutterstock.com/subscribe\r\n\r\nAlso, speaking of
  shutterstock: anyone know their logofont or is it custom?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    sold before at MyFonts and probably at FontShop as well, but it seems it\u2019s
    no longer available.\r\nYou might want to contact him.\r\nhttps://twitter.com/milesnewlyn"
