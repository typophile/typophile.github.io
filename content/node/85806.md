  but I want to find the original font file. Not looking for a cheap knock-off; I
  want the original font, complete with proper kerning and such. I've done some searches
  through the professional sites that I'm familiar with, but haven't had any luck.
  I do have a font labeled \"Ath Sans\", but it's slightly different, and just a little
  more clunky than the image shown.\r\n"

    the fact that it has lower case characters (which Athletic Sans Serif does not
    appear to have). Thanks Antoni-\r\n"
