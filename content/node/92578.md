    body: Great references-especially the alternatives to papyrus. I think Yoga is
      the typeface Lululemon uses.

  body: "\u201CA communication regarding yoga\u201D is somewhat vague. If you\u2019re
    communicating with folks who are already into yoga, any typeface whose chakras
    are aligned would do. If you're promoting it to the public, you may choose to
    work with or against stereotype. This is pretty stereotypical...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tempus-sans/\r\n\r\nwhile
    something as prosaic as Helvetica is not."

  body: Yoga was created in India, so I suggest a font that looks Indian. It doesn't
    have to be Indian, but it should have that flavor, somehow.
