  all the children. Cunina believes that every child, wherever in the world, is unique,
  has its own capacities and talents and is capable of learning.\r\nCunina is of opinion
  that every child has the right to have access to primary education. A child that
  is able to develop itself today, will later be better able to support itself \xE1nd
  will be able to support others in their social development.\r\nCunina has a heart
  for children."

  body: "You are off to a grand start. Have you tried the handwriting under the blocks
    at the top? Maybe the book pages could be thinner and not tapered... they kind
    of resemble cat whiskers now, but the book idea is great. They will have a hard
    time making a decision with these wonderful concepts.\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\nMichael"

    hands may have some trouble flipping the pages :)

  body: "The middle one reminds me of the retired [[http://www.identityworks.com/reviews/2000/cingular.htm|Cingular]]
    logo, only chubby. In the top row of logos, the sharp N in the middle cuts the
    the tagline in half.\r\n\r\nIn the last example, could you try making the person
    form an \"n\" instead of the i?"

  body: i think the two ideas at the top are your best bet, although i'd advise trying
    a different typeface

  body: The top two are the closest to expressing the vision. I like the <strong>top
    right</strong> idea, with the graduation cap on the 3rd kid. The flow symbolizes
    the natural progression of the education process. I'm not to crazy about the sharp
    edged font, though. Consider a typeface with rounder edges, but not <strong>too</strong>
    round that it makes the typeface look child-ish. These are great ideas. Good work.

    you try a version with tghe font from BOTTOM RIGHT... cause 'learning' won't need
    such sharp tips"

    a bit childish (of course NO problem in education) - but then it would be DOUBLE
    information because child/children are included allready in the pictograms from
    top right...\r\n\r\n"
