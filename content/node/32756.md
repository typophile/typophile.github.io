  test text generator</a> for my own use but I think it may be useful for every type
  designer. It is similar to Miguel's <a href=\"http://adhesiontext.com\">adhesiontext</a>
  but the texts are synthesised using a different system.\r\nI hope it works with
  all your browsers and OSes - if you have any problems or suggestions just let me
  know! Implementing further languages would be fairly easy if there is need for it
  (Danish/Norwegian is already on my list).\r\n\r\nTim"

    could hardly find anything useful, and now this topic. :)\r\n\r\nVery nice and
    useful."

  body: "Hi Tim,\r\n\r\nCongratulations for this text tool.\r\n\r\nI don't know if
    it's because of the text sources you've used, or the system you've used, but I
    have to say that the output for Portuguese doesn't look like Portuguese at all.
    There are way too many 'y's, 'k's and 'w's. I also see many sequences of letters
    that in Portuguese are not frequent or don't exist at all, like 'll', 'ff' and
    'nn'. (I've just searched [[adhesiontext]] and the only words using 'nn' that
    came up were 'scanner', 'cannabis', 'connosco' and a few obscure ones)\r\n\r\nOn
    the generator's page you say that the \"text is synthesized on the basis of language-specific
    lists of triplet frequencies\", and I wonder, did the system take syllables into
    account when those lists of triplets were created?"

  body: "Miguel,\r\nyou must have selected something else in addition to Portuguese
    because the triplets list for Portuguese does not contain any 'y's. Note that
    if you check Portuguese and \"neutral\" it will mix these two databases, introducing
    letters and combinations from other languages. If you really want purely one language
    make sure all others - including the ready-made mixes - are unchecked. \r\nAlso,
    if you want a typically Portuguese letter frequency distribution you should set
    both \"variety\" settings to 0 because otherwise letters which are rare in Portuguese
    would be boosted.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://justanotherfoundry.com/tools/generator/generator.py?language=pt&characters=all&chars=&kern=typ&kernchars=&kernlevel=0&lettervariety=0&pairvariety=0&frequencies=output&generate=Generate+Text\">This
    </a></strong> should generate a more Portuguese-looking text. Does it look better?\r\n\r\nThe
    tool does not take into account syllables, not even words. Every character, including
    the space character, is processed in the same way (with a little tweak to avoid
    extremely long words)."

    that looks much closer to Portuguese. I must have selected the wrong settings."
