    quite get the top of /1/.\r\nI rather like the illogical /Q/ counter!\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Eliason.. top of /L/ is a mistake that needs to solve like you
    said cuz I design this with separately little shapes and sometimes leave open
    and finaly don't work like is awaiting..!!\r\n\r\nI think /1/ need grow up the
    curve a little bit or the entire gliph, I'll test it.\r\n\r\nand /Q/ counter,
    well.. I really think that's not need help to be readable and clearly diferent
    between it self and /O/ counter.. and so.. and I expect this font will come to
    make unique specially for this kind details.. haha.. may be some people not like..
    may be and surely some peoples could love that detail.. I don't mind yet.. need
    some opinions else.\r\n\r\nThank you for notice me about that details and drop
    your advices."

  body: Z,z lack weight in horizontals. Set words like "SIZE, prizes" and you'll see
    how much it stands out.

    little update on another gliphs.. and can see the special ligature called byme
    like \"triple v\" that represent \"www\" apostrophe, done for reduce visually
    space and leave clear the reference to some web link.\r\n\r\nfeel free for comment
    and critique."

  body: I really like this font - and I think it works perfectly as a poster font.
    Could it be, that the small s has totally flat tops and bottoms?

  body: "1st phrase \"insight\" below have curve example of \"s\" and 2nd the flat
    one... same for \"S\".\r\nHere I done a test for compare the Flat and Curve \"S\"
    and \"s\"... Honestly I like the flat version, In fact, now I grow flats gliphs
    a little to compensate the visual weight between flats and curves shapes.\r\nThanks
    and regards!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SS_forum_4923.png]"
