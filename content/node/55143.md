  body: "jupiterboy please elaborate -\r\n\r\nThe only way i was thinking was to use
    the circle tool on a seperate layer, on top of type (using it as a guide) - effectively
    hand lettering. \r\n\r\n ive tried the installed filters (ie halftone etc) but
    without comporable success, nothing that can render in that quality.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "1. Render each letter in P-shop as a Grayscale image at 1200 dpi.\r\n\r\n2.
    Apply increasing levels of gaussian blur to the letters. Experimentation will
    give different end results.\r\n\r\n3. Convert each letter to bitmap, selecting
    the halftone option. Lower line screens will give a more pronounced dot. You may
    need to work with the angle of the halftone and rotation of the letter either
    before or after conversion to bitmap.\r\n\r\n4. Place each letter, or 1200 dpi
    composite of word, in page layout program and assign screen mix or spot color
    as desired.\r\n\r\n5. Open beer and consume."
