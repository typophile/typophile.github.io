  people needed to identify fonts until the day I needed one identified. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I am at work trying to make a website for a client. She wants me to use the text
  in the header image of her old site, on her new site. However, she does not know
  what font was used and the image is jpg so I cannot open it up and check the font..\r\n\r\nIt
  would be great if someone here could identify it for me. Thanks ahead of time.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the image, \r\nhttp://media.point2.com/p2a/htmltext/aa36/9b33/64ed/76b7ed6001687ea0534c/original.jpg
  \ \r\n\r\nIf possible I would like to know the white font and the gold font."

  body: "The white script looks like a squooshed <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/\">Bickham
    Script</a>.\r\nThe top right gold script is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/park+avenue/fonts/\">Park
    Avenue</a>\r\nThe rest looks like some kind of Garamond. Someone else will know."

  body: If you get the chance it might be nice to make the horizon in the picture
    actually horizontal. And while you're at it, see if you can make the type work.
    Currently the two script headings are competing and it's not clear which is more
    important. The two styles don't complement each other at all. It's usually also
    a bad idea to put informational text over a picture, especially if that means
    the text has to get a drop shadow ;)
