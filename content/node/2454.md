body: I have a hand-made kerning list consisting of pairs of characters, one pair
  per line &#40;in WordPad&#41;. The characters are the actual Windows codes, not
  descriptives like &#34;left square bracket&#34;, and the pairs are not separated
  by anything. I know FontLab can import AFM files, but I want to avoid converting
  my &#34;raw&#34; data to AFM before import. Help? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    is what I have done in the past to convert from characters to glyph names. It
    doesn&#39;t take too long, and once you have the macros it is easy to repeat the
    process for other lists or sample strings.

  body: The Adobe Glyph List is <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/glyphlist.txt">here</a>.
    Note that this is version 2.0, which contains additional recognised names from
    multiple sources. Personally, I found the earlier version more useful for font
    development, as with few exceptions there was only one &#39;correct&#39; name
    per Unicode character. General Adobe glyph naming rules are <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/unicodegn.jsp">here</a>.
    <BR> <BR>The easiest way to get your kerning data into FontLab is probably to
    replace character pairs with spaced glyph name pairs in your list, append &#39;KPX
    &#39; before each one, paste them into a AFM and import them into FontLab. Note
    that the count of kern pairs at the beginning of that section of the AFM should
    equal or exceed the actual number, otherwise the list may be truncated during
    import.

    <BR> <BR>All it does is convert non-alphabetic characters &#40;except the space
    and non-breaking space&#41; <i>in the Windows:Western codepage</i> to their Adobe
    names. So in my case I still had to do some manual processing: <BR>1&#41; Separate
    the pairs with a space. Which I actually did by hacking the macro: I put a space
    before each Adobe name, but then also had to find/replace all 52 alphabetic characters
    with space&#43;character &#40;which could be put in the macro as well though&#41;.
    This left me with a prefix space per line. <BR>2&#41; Put the &#34;KPX&#34; prefix
    per line &#40;no space since I got a prefix space from #1&#41;. This I did by
    typing in a Tab at the head of each line&#42; &#40;Shoutcast&#39;s Goa channel
    helped&#41; then doing a find/replace: Tab -&#62; &#34;KPX&#34;. <BR>3&#41; Put
    the kerning amounts &#40;which were 99% either &#34; &#43;125&#34; or &#34; -125&#34;&#41;.
    Using the same Tab trick. Tab is safe because nobody makes kerns with it... I
    assume! <BR> <BR>&#42; Note that leading Tabs are messed up by Word &#40;it turns
    them into &#34;ruler tabs&#34;&#41;, so I used WordPad. <BR> <BR>If I could get
    the macro to process linefeeds &#40;which I couldn&#39;t&#41; then I could get
    rid of manual processing entirely. <BR> <BR>And after that you cannibalize any

    choose any of the names? </i> <BR> <BR>This is a novelty of version 2.0 of the
    AGL. Previous versions had only Adobe&#39;s own glyph names, but version 2.0 includes
    names that have been used by other major developers, e.g. Apple, which Adobe software
    using AGL 2.0 will recognise. It is important to remember that the AGL does not
    primarily exist for the purpose of font developers, but for software developers
    who need to parse glyph names to obtain character codes. <BR> <BR>So yes, you
    can choose any of the names in the AGL, but for maximum exchangeability with other
    font developers I recommend using Adobe&#39;s original names from the previous
    AGL versions. Here is one of the Tiro resource files which you and others might
    find useful: a FontLab .nam file that covers all the Basic Multilingual Place
    assignments for Unicode 4.0. Unzip and open the .nam in a text editor and read
    the lengthy comments at the top to understand what the file contains. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

    <BR> <BR>If you drop this .nam file in your FontLab /Mapping folder, you can use
    it with the Generate Unicode and Generate Names functions in FL. When the new
    Tiro website goes online, we plan to have a resource download section from which
    this and other useful FL files will be available, including a .nam that uses a
    much more extensive list of human-friendly production glyph names.'

  body: 'Cool - thanks. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, I wrote: <BR>&#62; you cannibalize
    any old AFM file <BR> <BR>It turns out you need to make sure the source AFM file
    has a metrics entry for any character you&#39;re kerning: kern pairs for characters
    undefined in the &#34;StartCharMetrics&#34; section are ignored. The complication
    is that the names declared in AFM files output by FontLab don&#39;t always match
    the Adobe stuff, or maybe it&#39;s that they only [can] match one of the choices.
    Like if you declare a pair &#34;L middot&#34; &#40;useful in Catalan&#41; it won&#39;t
    show up because the metrics definition &#40;assuming it was output from FontLab&#41;
    uses &#34;periodcentered&#34; instead. And some stuff &#40;like the superior numerals&#41;
    are represented by Unicode numbers in the metrics section instead of names...
    <BR> <BR>So it looks like my macro needs revision &#40;to match FontLab&#41;.
    <BR>Or I guess one could use an AFM file with names that match the ones in the
    macro. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    with one dummy kerning pair, and then use that AFM as your kerning import source.

  body: Right, but the thing to watch out for is that the character names in the kerning
    pairs have to match the ones in the metrics section of the AFM file. That might
    seem obvious, but it gets complicated when you consider that the Adobe list shows
    multiple names per codepoint &#40;like any kern using &#34;middot&#34; instead
    of &#34;periodcentered&#34; won&#39;t be recognized upon [re]import&#41;. So basically
    you can/should just use the names in the AFM file that FontLab outputs - you don&#39;t
    need the Adobe list &#40;in this case&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found
    7 wrong names and one typo in my macro - I&#39;ll provide an updated version soon.
