  \ I need help with a logo that a committe has asked me to do.  \r\nThe problem is
  they gave me a sketch of what they want their logo to look like.  It is basically
  (3) on the attached.  Now i think it looks like the hazardous waste logo which I
  would hope nobody would want their logo to look like when trying to convey something
  positive.\r\nThey said they wanted blue and gold colors and three circles.  So i
  came up with (1) and (2a&b) to try to get them to shy away from (3).  I would love
  critism and any suggestions you can give me on the logos.  \r\nAlso at what point
  to I say that I don't want my name attached to something they are basically making
  me create.  I am a new graduate and am not quite sure of the protocol in the design
  world.\r\nThanks everyone for your time![img:sites/default/files/old-images/partnership_logo_5874.jpg]"

    to the biohazard symbol. I think that a side-by-side comparison or an overlay
    of the two would likely convince them.\r\n\r\nI would try keeping \u201CPartnership
    Award\u201D the same color instead of singling out \u201CPartnership\u201C unless
    the word partnership is somehow significant to the client and not to the award.
    \r\n\r\nTry to find a way to work the linking rings from 1 in with the the intersecting
    axis and ragged left type in 2b and I think that you'll have a winner."

    integrity for the sake of one client. Remember that they're hiring you because
    of your expertise in design. If they feel that they know more about designing
    a logo than you do, then maybe they should save themselves some cash and design
    it themselves.\r\n\r\nThat being said, logo design is always a collaborative process.
    I find that just telling the client that their ideas won't work isn't a very good
    solution. Try to come up with something that is similar to what they want, but
    doesn't have the faults that their ideas have. This is why they're paying you
    the big bucks.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "\r\nhey erin,\r\n\r\nit can be frustrating when a client has such a predetermined
    idea of what they want. \r\n\r\nbut i would encourage you to develop and present
    your own concepts as well. this is not a problem if you present your work to them
    in a professional manner. i.e., \"This concept is based off the initial sketch
    you gave me, but as I continued to think about your organization and what the
    logo needs to communicate, I developed these other concepts as well, and here
    is why they are strong...\"\r\n\r\nafter that, it typically depends on your confidence
    and relationship with the client how far you want to push your own work. that
    will also come with experience.\r\n\r\ngood luck!\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n"

    heart:)\r\n\r\nI am guessing, by their original logo and the strapline, that each
    ring or circle should link with both others, rather than hazard symbol think venn
    diagram, avoiding an obvious Olympic look, although option 1 does to some degree
    represent that. It does look less than impactful next to the biohazard symbol
    and I think you will have to consider the weight, on a business card or at small
    scale it could disappear. The ERS kerning needs to be sorted out. It also appears
    you are doing this in Photoshop, in order to maximise its usefulness you will
    need to create it in a vector-based software.\r\n\r\nAs for the protocol for disassociating
    yourself from the logo, I would never, in your position, turn down work, if you
    don't like it you don't need to include it in your portfolio but you will have
    to accept that there are some clients who like to have their mark on work.\r\n\r\nbtw.
    I don't think the <a href=\"http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutother/oxfordcomma?view=uk\">Oxford
    comma</a> is necessary after Education.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "jpad-thanks for your suggestions, i am working on different ideas now using
    your idea of combinations\r\n\r\nbegsini- i actually did present three different
    logos in the start, one of which i really like.  they then showed me (3) and i
    think they had that in mind all along.\r\n\r\ntimd- i agree that as a recent graduate
    i am in no position to turn down work.  the only reason i wanted to dissassociate
    my name from it was because when it is all done, the committee is presenting it
    to a board of directors saying that this is what i had come up with.  i was just
    hoping that i could get more business from the board after.\r\ni also have been
    playing around with them intersecting and it is really hard not to get the olympics
    feel.\r\ni will work on the kerning as well.  i didn't do it in photoshop it is
    just when i originally posted my samples they came out on the message board so
    huge i tried shrinking the file size. \r\n\r\nthanks everyone for your comments,
    i will post an updated logo soon.\r\n\r\nerin"

  body: "I guess that the weight of the strokes contributes to the similarity to Olympic
    rings, using a much heavier stroke and reducing the proportion of rings to wordmark
    should help avoid that. \r\nI think there is mileage in the overlapped rings and
    room to make sure that it resembles neither Olympic rings nor biohazard symbol,
    while still remaining true to the kernel of their original logo and their concept
    for change, if you feel they will be receptive Jarrod's comment about developing
    your own concepts will show the board that you have considered their requirements
    and if you can include a short passage about your reasons, whether technical or
    aesthetic, on the presentation panels so much the better. \r\nUltimately the client
    will have to live with the logo longer than you will and as I said in my previous
    post many feel like they have to make a contribution or give directions and it
    is very hard to dissuade them without a compelling argument (printing/technical
    concerns are usually quite good).\r\nTim"

    come up with anything that wows.  the following two are what I combined from jpads
    comments and the second one is trying to come up with something similiar to theirs
    but not so ugly, although i think the type is too hard to read around the circle.
    \ \r\ni am just getting so frustrated because i really took to heart that as a
    designer i should be able to take what they want and make it great.  and i am
    just coming up short.\r\nany suggestions or comments would be awesome-thanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/partnership_logo_6033.jpg]"

  body: "In the second the strapline would be more readable the other way up and there
    is a problem with the T of THE, ideally your title should be larger than your
    strap at the moment, with the colour difference, the blue is dominating.\r\n\r\nLook
    at the shapes that are created by the overlapping circles, kind of reminiscent
    of the old <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2006/06/23/to-trillium20060623.html\">Ontario
    trillium</a> logo, a flower indicates growth/success. A more 3d approach could
    be a <a href=\"http://home.online.no/~t-o-k/POV-Ray/Trefoil_Knot.jpg\">trefoil
    knot</a>, indicates an unbreakable link. Or for a more decorative Celtic approach,
    if appropriate, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dingbatcave/anns-speyerals/triskeli/charmap.html\">triskeli</a>,
    a combination in which no side dominates, but each is balanced.\r\n\r\nHope something
    here is inspiring, if not walk away from the project for a while, go for a walk
    or visit a museum or gallery and approach it fresh.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I like the way 3 is going. 3b is too busy. I think it still needs something,
    but I'm not sure what.\r\n\r\nIn 3, the text is too close to the mark. Think of
    the mark as a word of its own, and kern accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnd when you bring
    it to committee, my suggestion is only to bring one logo, with a few typeface
    and colour variations, but don't show them anything but your best work. In my
    experience, if you show a committee three different logos, their favourite will
    be your least favourite. If you only show them the one you like, and they don't
    like it, they can always give suggestions on how to modify it, but they can't
    pick the safe and easy (i.e. bland) logo.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
