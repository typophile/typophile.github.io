  body: Tough luck, franki luck. You can&#39;t download this font for free. You can
    license it for 750 euros, as the site explains. And as explained in the fine print,
    it is under strict copyright.

    great, it takes talent, time, <BR>work and luck. <BR>Women... that&#39;s another
    story.

  body: No offense taken but the purpose of this board is to identify fonts, not to
    help you illegally knock off corporate fonts. <BR> <BR>Why don&#39;t you consider
    using a sans serif font that resembles this one such as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/"
    target="_blank">Frutiger</a> which is much cheaper, especially if you only need
    a few weights. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure there are freebies that have the same look
    as well but you&#39;re on your own there.
