  want to accomplish this in one operation, but I can't seem to figure it out \u2026\r\n\r\nIf
  I do remove overlap - the result is something else. I understand that this has to
  do with clockwise / anti-clockwise paths, but please tell - is there a shortcut?

  body: Ok, I guess that either it's impossible, or no one uses Fontographer any more.

    Correct Path Direction.\r\n4. Select Remove Overlap. This does the same thing
    as Illustrator\u2019s \u2018Remove Front\u2019, but the box that was drawn around
    the objects remains. \r\n5. Delete the box"

  body: "Oh yes, there are plenty of people still using Fontographer. I don't have
    the money to upgrade to Fontlab, or even the $99 to spare for the 4.7 update.
    So I'm stuck using the 4.1.5 NFPU workaround for now.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip,
    Blairyo."

  body: "Well, since I brought it up, has anyone had a problem with Fontographer\xAE
    4.1.5 NFPU running in Classic under MacOS X 10.4.2? Specifically, if I move a
    referenced instance in a cahracter (especially when there are two such instances
    in a character space, e.g., an accented character) not only does Fontographer
    crash, but so does the entire Classic environment.\r\n\r\nThat's what's been happening
    to me anyway. \r\n\r\nThe only effective workaround seems to be to unlink references
    before adjusting the positions of the accents and letters beneath them. It's either
    that or I spring $99 for the upgrade. "

  body: Yes, the old Fog is a bit crash prone on OS X, but really, it's a wonder it
    still works at all, and makes serviceable fonts, not many software apps of similar
    vintage do. It was fun installing it from a floppy disk.
