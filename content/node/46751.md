body: I'm looking for an alternative to the typeface Knockout. It will be used quite
  large and should work in harmony with Univers 55 as body text. I have been considering
  Helvetica Inserat but it somehow feels a bit wrong...

  body: "I'm not trying to be a smartass, but have you considered Univers Bold Condensed?
    It sure would go well with Univers 55.\r\n\r\nAnd mixing Helvetic Inserat with
    Univers does indeed seem a bit wrong -- like putting butter and margarine on the
    same piece of toast."

  body: "The Linotype Univers Platinum Collection offers condensed weights in Heavy,
    Black and even ExtraBlack.  One of those should be sufficently \"heavy\" for your
    task and still blend nicely with your body text.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/de/53226/linotypeunivers-schriftfamilie.html"
