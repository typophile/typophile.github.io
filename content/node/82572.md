body: "Okay hi, I'm starting a clothing brand called exousia and here's a logo design
  that I'm looking at going with. My demographic is 15-25 year olds, it's casual clothing,
  sort of like a surf/skate kind of label with more of a slant towards the arts and
  music. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exousia clothing logo_6649.jpg]\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know what you think."

  body: X seems a bit narrow. Maybe you could add some horizontal "exit stroke" to
    it, so to add some of the curviness of the other letters.

  body: "If /X/ uses slanted strokes, /S/ should as well to balance it.\r\n\r\nCharacters
    /EXO/ seem narrower than /UA/.\r\n\r\n/X/ needs 90\xB0 stroke cut at the ends
    or others need angles.\r\n\r\n/O/ (and probably /E/ as well) seems shorter than
    /U/ which seems much taller."
