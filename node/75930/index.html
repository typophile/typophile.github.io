This book is from about 18 years ago. It's out of print, and never was scanned and placed online for eternity.

Years ago, I bought it when it fist came out. Years later I bought it again. I've moved a few times since, and do not find my copy.

Ari Davidow sent me his copy to borrow. I got it today. I intend to create a dozen designs of his, with bold versions, nikkud and taam too.

Everyone pales by comparison. Ismar David zal was the greater known Hebrew type designer.</div>

Ismar David, German/Israeli/American (1910 - 1996)

... and on June 3rd of that year, married Hortense Mendel. Ismar had met
Hortense, an associate of Robert Leslie at the Composing Room, during 
his 1951 trip to New York to show Intertype hisHebrew alphabets. 
The two spent six years together before Hortense died on October 9, 1960.



The whole article:

Ismar David, German/Israeli/American (1910 - 1996)

Ismar David, considered one of the few graphic designers, illustrators, and calligraphers of international reputation, was a
German-born graphic artist who practiced the first third of his
professional career in Jerusalem and the remainder in New
York City. He is noted for his brilliant work in Hebrew and
Latin calligraphy, lettering, and type design, as well as for his
distinctive linear style of illustration.David liked to say that the
hand is the most marvelous tool if properly trained, and his
own handwork supports this conviction.

Ismar David was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw,
Poland) on August 27, 1910. At the age of fourteen, he left
school to apprentice as a house painter and varnisher. After
receiving his journeyman papers, however, he returned to
study decorative painting at the Arts & Crafts School of Berlin-
Charlottenberg, where many of the finest book craftsmen of
the first part of the century taught and studied.Hans Orlowski
and Johannes Boeland were among his teachers.

In 1932, at the age of twenty-one, Ismar David entered and won
an international competition sponsored by the Jewish National
Fund for the design of its honorary Golden Book. He traveled
to Jerusalem to supervise the execution of the project, and he
settled there for the next twenty years and established a studio
for interior and graphic design. In addition to receiving a
broad range of commissions from private industry, David
accepted commissions from national institutions and the state
government for design projects including posters, postage
stamps, and currency.
During his residence in Jerusalem, Ismar David made one of
his most important contributions to twentieth century graphic
design with the conception and development of an innovative
family of Hebrew typefaces. His interest in developing Hebrew
types that would be in harmony with the modern spirit and
that would help to transform Hebrew into an everyday
language eventually lead to David Hebrew. This unshaded and
unserifed type design was cast for machine composition in
1954 by the Intertype Corporation and was later available on
the Photon machine. In 1984 the Stempel type foundry
commissioned David to rerender David Hebrew with diacritical
marks for digital composition. To this day David Hebrew is
widely used and much copied. The light appearance of David
Hebrew makes it well suited for setting poetry. It is also favored
for use in exhibition catalogs, finely printed books, and Israeli
newspaper supplements.

Before moving permanently to the United States, Ismar David
made several visits to New York City.His first trip, in 1939, was
to work on the Palestine Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair.
In 1947, he traveled to New York to study printing methods.
With the help of Dr. Robert Leslie, he returned in 1951 to make
arrangements with the Intertype Corporation for the casting of
David Hebrew. And finally in 1952, David visited New York to
design and install an industrial exhibition for Bonds for Israel.
Ismar David emigrated to the United States in 1953, and on
June 3rd of that year, married Hortense Mendel. Ismar had met
Hortense, an associate of Robert Leslie at the Composing
Room, during his 1951 trip to New York to show Intertype hisHebrew alphabets. The two spent six years together before
Hortense died on October 9, 1960.

Upon his arrival in New York City in 1953, Ismar David established
a design studio and began teaching Latin calligraphy at
Cooper Union and Pratt Institute. He had expected the bulk of
his commissions to come from designing decorative elements
for synagogues, however, he found his mainstay work in the
1950’s, 60’s, and early 70’s in the publishing industry. David
worked steadily as a designer for leading American publishers
including Alfred A. Knopf; Atlantic, Little Brown; Ballantine
Books; Fleming H. Revell; Harper & Row; Harry Abrams;
Houghton Mifflin Company; J.B. Lippincott Company; McGraw-
Hill; Pocket Books; Random House; Thomas Y. Crowell; and
Viking Press, among others. In a short span, he designed book
jackets or covers for more than 200 books.

Ismar David remained a free-lance artist throughout his career.
In addition to steady work in cover design, calligraphy, and
lettering, Ismar David earned commissions for book illustration
and developed the style of illustration for which he is best
remembered—a style characterized by striking patterns of
lines. This distinctive linear style was particularly well suited
for the Limited Edition Club’s 1971 publication of Pascal’s Les
Pensées, for which David created a dozen full-page, hypnotic
color-illustrations—pre-separated in the tradition of printmaking—
as well as ornamental tailpieces, and text frames. As
would become his custom, Ismar’s conceptions in vivid
oranges, greens, purples, blues, and golds were meant to
accompany the thoughts of the author, not to illustrate them literally.His 58 illustrations for the Union of American Hebrew
Congregation’s 1973 bilingual edition of The Psalms followed
the same non-literal approach. For this project, which David
considered his most personal work, he combined his ideas
about illustration and type and book design, and his efforts
were recognized by The American Institute of Graphic Arts
(AIGA) with a 1973 “Fifty Books of the Year”distinction. Both
Les Pensées and The Psalms proved to be very popular among
collectors, and they stand as two of his best efforts in book
illustration.

Though he never lost interest in graphics, much of David’s
energy in the latter part of his career was devoted to architectural
design and decoration. Perhaps his most important work
in this field was produced during a thirty-year association with
Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, NY. Beginning in
1965, he planned the layout of the park, including fountains and
other features; he also designed mausoleums and other
building complexes, and their interiors. He also lettered
numerous inscriptions for wall decorations and architectural
features in the park. 

Proof of Ismar David’s uninterrupted
connection with graphics came in 1991, when in collaboration
with calligrapher and partner Helen Brandshaft, he designed
and illustrated a bilingual version of The Book of Jonah,
published by the Chiswick Press in a limited edition.
Teaching was another constant element in Ismar David’s career.
In addition to instructing at the Cooper Union and Pratt
Institute, he gave lectures and conducted workshops on Latin
and Hebrew calligraphy over the years. Eventually he distilled his well-tested teaching materials and summarized his views on the historical, aesthetic, and technical aspects of the Latin alphabet into Our Calligraphic Heritage: The Geyer Studio Writing Book. The three-part work of text, alphabet folders, and
compositions, encased in a box designed to function as an
easel, was published in a limited edition in 1979 by the Geyer
Studio—a professional calligraphy studio for whom David
worked as a contractor from the late 1960’s through the early
1980’s. Ismar produced the Hebrew counterpart to Our
Calligraphic Heritage with the 1990 publication of The Hebrew
Letter: Calligraphic Variations. This instructional work
includes a text and alphabet charts, and is a writing book in the
tradition of European writing books. In both works, David
fuses the rich historical background of the calligraphic arts
with practical and aesthetic aspects of the art of writing in the
twentieth century.

In the early 1990s, Ismar David continued to take on select
commissions for graphic design; however, he also expressed his
personal interest in three-dimensional form with the creation
of such objects as a folding baby cradle and a paper Elijah’s cup
and folding seder plate. Before he died on February 26, 1996, in
New York City, Ismar David produced his 1996 greeting card—
the last in a forty-odd-year series that traces the evolution of
his lettering and illustration styles, and the constant influence
of biblical themes.</div>

I do not understand you. Say it clearly.

If it's money to which you refer, Ismar's stuff won't make a bundle, or even half a bundle.

But there should be some books out, for whoever wants the stuff, it's there.

About his fonts, if 10 or more are digitized, I think he'd be proud.

Am I wrong, or a money-hungry capitalist?

According to Shmuel Gutman z"l, he told me that Ismar David was happy for people to copy and/or change his font, so there are no copyright issues here. 

This is of course hearsay from a person who is no longer alive but it looks like that there is no copyright on this typeface.

HHenri Friedlaender returned to me a roalty check that I sent to him in the mid-eighties. He explained that the Amsterdam type foundry bought the intellectual ptoperty rights.

According to halacha Jewish law, zchus hayotzer the creator's ownership is inherited by his or her descendants forever.

Hence, I asked Michael about his wife and children. Perhaps, it reverts to his parents and siblings, or even next of kind.

It is called sometimes "Zchus hayotzim", or "Zchus hamechaber".

There are only two thin books published on the topic.

One book, with a dark blue cover, was published by a now defunct publishing house, "Machon L'Ohalei Shem" in the nineties. The other book is much older, with a gold cover. I think its called: "Zchus hayotzim".

Very few rabbis are expert is this topic, which is like why you think that it does not exist. Fewer can rule on this matter.

The famed Tzemach Tzedek rule of this matter over two hundred years ago. No one since then has refuted his views about "Zchus hayotzim". He delineates 5 factors that can earn worldide exclusivity forever.

This responsa is published in Hebrew in two other books, "Chidushei Tzemack Tzedek Al Hashas", with commentaries, pp. 78-??, by "Machon L'Ohalei Shem", 1992, and "Chidushei Tzemack Tzedek Al Hashas" by Kehos (in print).</div>

However, since you have stated publicly on this forum and verbally on the phone to me about 3.5 years ago, that you would pay the children of Koren for your Crown font, this means that you publictly admit that your Crown font is a copy of the Koren typeface and that somebody in the Koren "family" deserves royalties on the typeface. Your only contention is <em>who</em> should receive the money – Koren's descendants or the company that owns the rights to the font.

I guess the question is, is the Crown font vaguely influenced by Koren, or is it a copy. I think that most people on this expert forum on type would agree that your image is very much Koren and would be considered a copy. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was thinking about my statements about the great type designer Tzvi Narkiss. His popular design Narkiss Tam I claimed originated by a concentration camp victim, who was forced by the Nazis to create a poster in Yiddish for a play, and used hand-made lettering similar to Narkiss Tam. I saw a photograph of that poster, as the Nazis used it as propaganda to show that the concentration camp were cultured, and a pleasurable experience.

Until I can locate that photograph, it is correct to think merely that Tzvi Narkiss saw that photograph too, and was inspired by that lettering design.

Narkiss was in deed a great type designer, and it was unlikely that he commit such a lowly act. </div>

No I didn't. check carefully what I said.

The Koren that you are posting is not pure Koren. The Koren that you are posting I think is Masterfont's Koreen. I'm not a lawyer but it seems you have copied his version of Koren.

Also you write, "Koren Publishing Company Purchased from the Estate of Eliyahu Koren in 20xx". 

Again, incorrect. You are rewriting history with incorrect information. This never happened.

Koren Publishers Jerusalem (the correct name of the company) was formed to publish Eliyahu Koren's Tanakh in the late '50s. Eliyahu Koren was an employee of the company that was formed in his name. The owner was Mr Elie Kahan (his daughter is a director in the company now). Mr Kahan recently sold his company to the current owner a few years ago. 

I'm not sure what that means legally, but I just wanted to correct a few comments that you have made.</div>

===

Let me get it straight.

Koren Publishers Jerusalem employed Eliyahu Koren. The company was owned by Mr Elie Kahan. It published a Tanach, featuring Eliyahu Koren's font. It expended much money in research to correct the textual deficiencies.

You claim that Koren Publishers Jerusalem owns these corrections. 
Do Koren Publishers Jerusalem own the typeface as well?
Did Eliyahu Koren create his type as a 'work for hire'? 
Did Eliyahu Koren work for a salary while creating the typeface during work hours?
This is the definition of 'work for hire'.

When was Koren Publishers Jerusalem sold to its present owners?
Was Mr Elie Kahan alive at the time of the sale?
Is his daughter a part owner now? Do she own more that 50%?
At what point in time, was Koren, Koreen, or Keren, digitized?

GoHebrew: We are only talking about Tanakh Bold. What font are you talking about?

KPJ didn't purchase anything. I don't understand. Oh. I see you problem. Okay.

Eliyahu Koren was an employee at a company called Koren Publishers Jerusalem Ltd. He worked at the office until he died about 10 years ago. The company never bought anything from him -- it wasn't his! It was the company's. I think this is where you are getting confused. It's not like Gutman who created fonts independently and sold them, but more like a typedesigner that works at a company called Masterfont or Adobe. The respective companies may give the designer credit, but they don't <em>buy</em> from the employee their designs -- they belong to the company.

More recently, the ownership of KPJ changed hands, but that is irrelevant. Does that clarify things? I designed the new Koren Sacks Siddur, but I don't own the design nor do I have copyright on it and nor do my chidren have any rights to it. But the owner of KPJ does. My name is mentioned in the siddur but it doesn't make it mine. The only difference, and I guess the confusion, is that the new owner didn't rename the company Freeman Publishers Jerusalem :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We have a funny naming convention here. The Koren face wasn’t bold or regular or anything. It was just the face. There was no bold per se. I prefered to call it Koren Tanakh. However, there is also a light version of the font. For commercial reasons, Masterfont wanted the "regular" font to be called "bold" and the light version to be called "regular" since in Israel when translated people don’t know what "light" is so much.

What you are showing on screen is what I would call Tanakh Bold and looks just like the image of the letters from that book that you bought in the flea market.</div>

No, my Bold is actually Bold. I will post it shortly. 

So, there never was, or is, a bold weight of Koren, or Koreen, or Keren?

Again, I have two sources: 

a) an old book that has a manuscript featuring a typeface design that I suggeest Eliyahu Koren used to draw his typeface design. The book is located at RIT, in the Cary Graphic Art Library, in Rochester, NY.

Then, I have also:

b) another real bold typeface based on drawings in a different book that I bought at a flea-market, and cut into pieces and scanned in 1989.

You are mixing up the two scenarios.</div>

Clearly, there is a strong resemblance between Eliyahu Koren's Koren or Tanach Bold, a typeface design from the pre-PstScript days of PostScript, Shmuel Guttman's Keren from the PostScript days of 1993, Tzvika Rosenberg' Kareen and his fairly recent digitization of KPJ' Koren, and my Crown from 1989, when none of the above existed electronically.

The naming of Crown is reflected is the typeface design itself. If you look at many of its letter forms, there are protrusions, shpitzim, or small crowns, that ornament the typeface design. They are its beauty, in my view. On account of them, I named this font, "Crown".

I see similar alliteration, as you point out. This is coincidental. 

Blatant naming similar to another very similar typeface design is Le-be (is it prounched 'lee-bee' - like 'my heart' - for LeBe (pronounced 'lah-bay'), or Keren or Koreen for Koren.

Did Shmuel Guttman, Masterfont, or Eliyahu Koren, create a true bold weight?</div>

Many many typefaces which I created were from lousy small and dirty originals. Scanner were crude 300 dpi device with poor 'depth perception'. Usually, I just had a book, or a photograph or an ancient document. Often the document had another 'part' in a different book.

I had a fascinating system then, that old-time punch-cutters used to create type. This was two grids, one at actual size and consisting of tracing paper. The larger grid was regular white paper with the same proportions mapped out per letter. Both grids were scanned, and super-imposed for acuracy.

Look at the various Romm Vilnas and Romm Rashis. They were created in this way too. The Linotype FrankReuhls were also.

Henri/Hadasa was made entirely from scratch, as junky scanners were a fortune in 1988. I used my trusty grid system and some old Hebrew magazines in Hadasa that I pulled out some trash can in Tel Aviv. It was set in metal type.

Henri Friedlaeder zal told me that my version was the closest to the original.</div>

Many many 'typeface designs' did not have a set of large clear specimens. Many of these were provided to me by customers. They were clipping from newspapers and magazines of words. I compared and compared, and picked out what I perceived as the 'best', with very little ink spread.

Gutman was recognising that the font was designed by Koren, but changed by Gutman. This was not done with permission of Koren Publishers Jerusalem.

Koreen was named such because Masterfont was creating a version of Koren. Again recognising the fact that the font was based on Koren and to this day still pays royalties on the font. I again must reiterate that the Koreen font was created with permission and approval of Koren Publishers Jerusalem and even Eliyahu Koren himself went over some of the nuances of this version of the typeface.</div>

He passed away about 10 years ago. Of course he didn’t review Gutman’s design!!!! Gutman made the design WITHOUT Koren’s approval!!!!

They changed all the letter forms.

This is all public information. Have a look at the real Koren font and then look at Koreen and you’ll see the differences in each letter. Both typefaces are available for purchase from Masterfont.

Eli, 

Mr. Koren designed his famous Koren from 1943 through 1953. Right Raphael? He was extremely talented, but like most every designer, was influenced greatly by manuscripts. But he is still its creator. That's what type design is all about!

I made my Crown in 1989. I made the first digitally. There was no Keren, or no Koreen. Even Koren was in an old Bible. Nobody used the typeface design. He made it for KPJ to have an exclusive typeface design, and also no one could reprint the Koren Bible.

I don't claim that I created anything in a vacuum. I doubt if Mr. Koren would either. This is Raphael's assertion.

er duh! they are the same font. This is Masterfont’s version of the real Koren font but with 2 different names. Of course they are the same. The hei I think was changed for a technical reason if I recall.

<cite>Mr. Koren designed his famous Koren from 1943 through 1953. Right Raphael? </cite>
I have no idea where you got your dates from. Could you please back up your assertations?

Again you are rewriting history. Who says there was no Koreen? Have you checked that? I’m not sure that’s true. Koren wasn’t in an "old" Bible. The Koren Bible is probably the best sold Bible in Israel and we sells tens of thousands of them every year. 

He did NOT make it for Koren Publishers to have an exclusive typeface design. What on earth are you talking about. Why do you write such nonsense. This was not his motive. You never met the guy. You have no idea what you are talking about. 

<cite>and also no one could reprint the Koren Bible.</cite>
Again, talking out of your hat. It was not so that nobody could reprint the Koren Bible. Why do you make such rubbish up!!!!

<cite>I don't claim that I created anything in a vacuum. I doubt if Mr. Koren would either. This is Raphael's assertion.</cite>
I have no idea what you are trying to say. 

<cite>You sound like a kid who learns that there is no Santa Clause. "What Eliyahu Koren took his Koren design from old manuscripts?"</cite>
again what does this mean?

You have, in your esteemed ignorance, compared 4 copies of the Koren font to each other to try and prove a point that you can’t prove since they are all copies (including yours!!!) The "Koren" that you posted and Koreen are the same font from the same designer (Masterfont) just under 2 names. We know that they are versions of the original because Masterfont says so! Keren we know is a copy because the designer of Keren, Shmuel Gutman, told me to my face. It’s just your amazing Crown font that somehow was created from ancient manuscripts and just by chance happens to look just like the other 3 copies.... hmmmm.... I wonder what that means.

For those of you interested in seeing the <em>real</em> Koren font (and not any of it’s knockoffs, legal or otherwise):

er duh! they are the same font. This is Masterfont’s version of the real Koren font but with 2 different names. Of course they are the same. The hei I think was changed for a technical reason if I recall.

What do you by the "the same font"?

Are they the very same font file with two different names.

One 'e' goes to you, ans MF gets a commission.
Two 'ee's goes to MF, and you get a royalty.
But MF's hei is a bit wider, for Tzika's secret reason.

I have no idea where you got your dates from. Could you please back up your assertations?

See http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/koren-mf/ for 1943.

Again you are rewriting history. Who says there was no Koreen? Have you checked that? I’m not sure that’s true. Koren wasn’t in an "old" Bible. The Koren Bible is probably the best sold Bible in Israel and we sells tens of thousands of them every year.

Let me try again. Koren MF and Koreen MF are the same, yes the same, yes the same, yes the same font. It could be that there were some slight variations. But they were the same, let me just say this one more time, the SAME font. For both these fonts, Koren gets a royalty from Masterfont. We DO NOT sell fonts. We sell Siddurim and Tanakhim etc. Our full range of products can be found on www.korenpub.com.

Okay, I hope we have clarified that. There are no "secret reasons". Just because I don’t know about something, it doesn’t make it a secret. It makes me less knowledgeable.

The <real> Koren font is what I posted. I think you can see quite clearly that it’s clearly different from the 4 variations that you posted. I use the term "knock-off" loosely. I have no idea what to call it. Interpretation? Copy? Version? 

The only difference between the MF versions/knock-offs/interpretations/copy of the Koren font and Gutman’s and yours, is that the MF versions were done WITH PERMISSION AND INVOLVEMENT OF ELIYAHU KOREN/KOREN PUBLISHERS JERUSALEM. 

I am shocked and horrified that you are using "Myfonts" as a credible source of the date of the design. It may be true, but I would need something a little more accurate than that!

It's not wrong to think this.

Frederick Goudy suggests in his thin book of typefaces that this is a strong reason for a company or an institution like a university or a government agency, to have a custom typeface.

First, it adds to that entity's notoriety. Second,, it distinquishes it from the others with generic typefaces. Third, if anything is printed in its name, it then can be spotted.</div>

Name one.

<<

OK.

No one no one NO ONE heredi uses a Koren Bible.

Why?

Well, you tell me.

According to Jewish law, a Bible may not be printed without a valid commentary. Why? We Jews do not believe in the Written Torah without an Oral Torah.

The text of the Bible is the Written Torah, and the Commentary is the Oral Torah.

So, who buys the Koren Bible?

Researchers (they are few), Dat Leumi Jews (well-Orthodox Jews who have learned very little), Christians (who are constrained to buy without a commentary, some members of other Orthodox group who also have learned very little, and non-Orthodox Jews who want to have an inexpensive Jewish Bible.

I never ever saw in a dozen synagogues what Raphael claimed, that if there is a question about the accuracy of the Torah reading, people commonly look into a Koren Bible.

Yes, anything printed in a book, eg a manuscript printed in a book as a photograph, hand-written or not. Your sample seems like a reproduction of a page from an old book. It seems hand-written.

But a typeface design can be a machine-made text, too - in a book, or from a desktop printer.

When I revived the Romm family letter forms, what is mine? Only the computer code which produces the images. 

The fact that the image of your aleph appears a particular way is your effort. But, in this case, the image is public domain.

If you make the same font, it's not copying - it's just another rendition. Do you agree?

		<div class="commentbody">The typeface design, better known as Hadasa (after the Hadasa Printing School where he taught) was named at first, "Queen Esther". This is allusion to Hadasa, for the Talmud tells us that "Esther's real name is Hadasa". When I worked closely with John Hudson (who designed the nikkud and taam), "Queen Esther" was renamed after its great creator, Henri Friedlaender zal.

Mr. Friedlander told me in 1988 that my version was closest to the original drawings. The is likely due to the fact that I did not use photo-typesetting specimens. Rather, I used old magazines and newspapers as specimens. I created it by eye only, and a crude grid system. In those days, I didn't have a scanner.

Israel,

Just out of curiosity -- are you talking about religion magazines? newspapers? Yated Ne'eman? Hamodia? </div>

"Great! Just want I'm looking for."

I cut out the letters of the alef-beis, and assembled them by categories. In my grid system, size wasn't an issue. I just wanted clarity.

Now, I look back and think it was impossible.

Koren Bible Type

Judah L. Magnes, President of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem asked Eliyahu Koren, then Korngold, to create a new font for an entirely new edition of the Hebrew Bible that he sought to publish under the University's auspices during World War II. The Bible was to be the first Bible designed, edited, printed, and bound by Jews in nearly 500 years. A design competition was held, and Korngold's font won.
The preliminary version of the font that grew out of the competition was used in an edition of the Book of Jonah issued in 1946 by the publishing house of The Hebrew University (later Magnes Press). The font was not cast for this modest publication, but rather drawn by Korngold and reproduced photographically. The font was based on the Moshe Ben-Asher Codex of the Prophets manuscript, belonging to the Karaite community in Cairo, the earliest Medieval manuscript with a colophon, written in 895 CE in Tiberius.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This article says that Koren drew the font before there was a publishing company on his name. 

If so, the font was his own work, and not a work for hire. 

Hence, his children do deserve to receive a royalty according to Jewish law. Yet, according to secular law, it is a public domain desisn. The current code from Masterfont may belong in part to KPJ, but not those derived from earlier drawings.

Do you agree, Raphael?</div>
