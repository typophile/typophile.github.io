body: "Recent activity on the Typophile Blog has necessitated some changes in order
  to make this feature more meaningful for the community as a whole.  By keeping this
  open to everyone, we've getting way too much of the wrong content. (Read as: Type
  IDs, spam, etc) Starting today, the Typophile Blog will only be written by select
  authors to post typography related content, both original and showcasing other great
  sources on the web. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to be an author on the blog, send
  me a PM with links to your sample content and a description of how you'd like to
  contribute. Please understand that we'll keep it to a small circle at first as we
  shift back in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThanks-\r\n\r\n//jared\r\n"
