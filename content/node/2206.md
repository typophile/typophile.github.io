    this latter tracked tighter - it&#39;s too loose for readability.&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Mmmh.... <BR> <BR>Mmmmh..... <BR> <BR> <BR>It does have similar forms. But
    even if Eureka&acute;s curves could be better, this font is too &#39;destructed&#39;
    to me to be combined with Eureka. Even if Eureka gets this Techno look as well,
    used in big sizes. <BR> <BR>Jacques <BR> <BR>PS: What is your story with this

  body: ' Story? <BR>I&#39;m just paying attention to designs that apply a certain
    rigidity to the conventional humanist structure, especially ones with what I&#39;m
    calling &#34;Latin slab&#34; serifs. Key is admittedly an extreme case. Better
    ones are FF Zine, FF Olson, Parkinson&#39;s Azuza and The Foundry&#39;s Form.
    Why am I paying attention? I guess because of Patria. I like the &#34;honesty&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s the next trend in text fonts, baby!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Hmm. I kinda like it. Does that make me rebellious? Nah, seriously it reminds
    me of  <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily27469.html" TARGET="_top">PMN
    Caecilia</A> or TheSerif at <A HREF="http://www.lucasfonts.com/" TARGET="_top">Lucas
    Fonts</A>. Maybe this could be used as a less straight-faced version of it?

  body: 'Although there is some superficial resemblance between the faces you mention,
    Hrant, and Key. There is one &#39;key&#39; difference. While FF Zine, FF Olsen,
    Azuza, and Foundry Form all attempt to invigorate traditional forms through a
    contemporary medium and within a digital vernacular &#40;an avenue which I think
    traces its roots to Swift&#41;, Key is just messing around with some shapes: <BR>
    <BR>&#91;from the Veer website&#93; <I>A bold, chunky typeface . . . that explores
    the manufactured or prefabricated aesthetic: construction from a set of graphic
    shapes. Letters are treated as individual graphic elements within a set grid.
    This is an aesthetic based purely on the look of the graphic form . . .</I>  <BR>
    <BR>The others are admirable, hard-working typefaces; I think Key is in a different
    class -- not refined enough for text, too blocky, in my opinion, for more than
    the occasional whatchew-lookin-at?, I&#39;m-so-rebellious, Rolling Stone headline.
