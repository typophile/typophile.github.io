  body: "That article lists one of OS X's features as \"More than $1,000 of the best
    fonts available today, including Baskerville, Herman [sic] Zapf\u2019s Zapfino,
    Futura, and Optima.\" Maybe Zapf only references Zapfino, but that's an unfortunate
    placement of Futura between those two. Unless Zapf did the digital version?\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I was watching the WWDC (or MacWorld, I can't remember which) where OS X
    was first introduced, and I was reminded of how many things we now take for granted
    that were considered revolutionary 7 years ago \u2014 mostly things that are simple
    graphic operations or UI things that seem so intuitive now.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also,
    it was really odd seeing a Stevenote set in Marker Felt."

  body: "I got it and installed it on my G4 Cube right away, which was really exciting,
    but there were not many native applications at first, mostly just stuff that came
    with the OS. Everything else had to be run in Classic mode. \r\n\r\nIt felt very
    foreign at first, like it wasn't really a Mac, but a Next machine. I played with
    it a bit from time to time, but booted into OS 9 most of the time so I could get
    real work done. \r\n\r\nIt was quite frustrating because OS 9, though better than
    earlier systems, was still fairly prone to system crashes and freezes, and lots
    of other headaches. OS X, even in the first version, rarely had anything like
    a system crash (i.e., kernel panic), and if a program did crash, it never affected
    anything else. Classic did go down pretty easily, but at least it didn't bring
    down the whole system when it did. So I was always wishing more things ran native
    so I could switch over to X for good.\r\n\r\nAside from lack of native applications,
    the other thing that kept me from using OS X full time was that it was painfully
    slow. It wasn't really until 10.2 (Jaguar) that it was usable, speed-wise.\r\n"

    years ago I was still running Linux, Solaris and OpenBSD most of the time with
    a little Windows at the office. IIRC I picked up an iBook to play with OS X after
    the 10.0.5 release, and it became my primary OS after I dropped by the Apple store
    to get my free 10.1 update. It\u2019s been at least a few years since I used any
    of the other UNIX systems at home, and my Windows box hasn\u2019t even been plugged
    in since some time last year.\r\n\r\nOS X may not be perfect, but in my mind it\u2019s
    the best desktop OS around. Now if only Photoshop CS 3 could handle complex files
    on my Intel Mac!"

  body: "Things I miss from the old days...\r\n\r\nExtensions- Now we have frameworks,
    kernal extensions, components, and daemons that do the same thing but they have
    cryptic names. Don\u2019t even think about trying to trouble-shoot on your own!
    I liked being able to go in to the system folder and tell you what everything
    was but forget that now! The internals are even more intricate and delicate. I
    like how the old OS would hide everything from  you. \r\n\r\nThe Power button
    on the keyboard- Steve Jobs took it away because he said that most users leave
    their machines on. What a bunch of crap! If I have workstation that hogs a ton
    juice the way a G5 does of course its going off and of course its that big machine
    is going on the floor too. So now I have reach down to turn the machine on- not
    cool! Keyboard power-up was a great feature.\r\n\r\nClones- Power Computing was
    the performance arm of the mac universe at the time. I guess we can always install
    OS X on a white box with some concerted effort.\r\n\r\nThe smiley mac at start
    up- its all austere now. Leopard is a cold place to be. I actually liked the pinstipes
    in 10.1 and the original Aqua but times have changed.\r\n\r\nI liked the crash
    sounds too. Macs crash all the time but even that should be special. Remember
    the car crash on the 6100 AV? !!!\r\n\r\nPowerPC- I still believe that anything
    Intel can do IBM can do better. If they actually tried to keep pace But IBM\u2019s
    focus is on gaming consoles and intergrated products that don\u2019t have the
    rapid pace of desktop processors. The Power6 Lite would have been the G6.\r\n\r\nRemember
    what Copland was supposed to do??? THEMES!!! C\u2019mon Apple get with it! \r\n\r\nAll
    in all I have never felt comfortable using Windows and I am very glad Microsoft
    and Apple do compete in the OS space. OS X does so many things well and very stable...
    although application quits are still common.\r\n\r\nThing I wish Apple did right
    now:\r\n\r\nComplete Complex Contextual OpenType Support !!! Until they do, I'm
    standing pat with Tiger. Good enough is actually great!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: Seven years for an OS? I'm not in the Mac world anymore. But I remember the
    early days in the 80s when the OS wouldn't last seven months. Remember when they
    updated with wierd numbers, and a different version number for Finder and System?

    Macs have a very decent deep-sleep mode. Yea, they'll still trickle power, but
    he was right...most folks do NOT turn of computers anymore.\r\n\r\n7 years now?
    I'm feeling old.\r\n"
