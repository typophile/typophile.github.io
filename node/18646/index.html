  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I guess you get what you pay for. Live & learn. In a fix, I went to a 'logo farm' for my production company. I specialize in long-form network / documentary work and needed something quick for a project. 

It took 'final approval' to get the electronic files and now, hopefully, I can take the tweaking to another level. Now - there's time to play before a printing order and I can't help feeling that this could be 'more'. The font's Gothic No. 13 and the icon's a cityscape they came up with. Pantone 1805U for the reddish tint. 

I do really like Trade Gothic (which is a bit skinnier than this Gothic) but might be too skinny when up against the looming city thingie. It definitely makes for odd text positioning. Any and all input appreciated. I can take it.      Thanks in advance - Michael

		<div class="commentbody">First thing that caught my eye was the strange perspective on the plane where the "buildings" rise from. It's kind of weird.

The idea of the buildings rising forming an F is nice, but I'm a bit bothered by the strong perspective. I'd make a kind of isometric grid, and just have the buildings rise without the high perspective. I hope I'm making sense here... it's hard to explain what I'm talking about. Tomorrow, I'll post a jpeg explaining what I mean.

As for the type treatment, it's okay now, but it seems a tad cliché. Maybe have the "Fever City" line in a condensed font, and the "studio" line in a normal, or even extended font. Trade Gothic's font styles would indeed be excellent for that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The strong perspective would work for me if it were executed correctly. It seems like they were going for a wacky cartoon approximation of perspective, but it ended up looking more like they just botched half the lines. Strong concept though. I would make an actual 3D model and try different viewpoints. If the left side of the F-building shows, you could try putting the type on it. A simple flythrough would also make a nice logo animation for the screen.

The type is kind of traditional in comparison to the logo. It seems to call for something a bit more constructed.</div>

This is rough, to say the least, but you have an implied city, and the excessive gradation wasn't helping. Typography is more subtle. ? Just an idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Good points all around. Thanks for puttin' eyes on it and helping. Keep 'em coming... To that end, I do like your 'clean' take, Eric. There's implied confidence  versus "Hey! 3D cartoon-type stuff!". 

There might be a happy medium as well. Maybe the windows add to the clutter / gradient mess? Originally, I remember the 'Fever City' text not being as big. Not to play armchair designer, but possibly they felt it wasn't weighted proportionally against this BIG city icon.

As I mentioned, Trade Gothic is lighter than this Gothic but I do like Eric's choice too. Clean. Might be worth digging up an earlier, less cluttered jpeg from the review process. Or not - I like these new directions.</div>

As for Trade Gothic, that is a good question. I might have an unhealthy attachment to the good books I've seen it used for cover-wise. It might not play that well in this specific deisgn though. 

The closest I can guesstimate on your treatment is ITC Avant Garde Gothc. Even in the ballpark? Thanks again.....

As for a font I suggest something like Trade Gothic Extended. Try the 2 color version of the icon and shrink it in relation to the type. Tighten the tracking because your icon is so spread out, you don't want the text to be also.</div>
