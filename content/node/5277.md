body: anyone watch Stepford Wifes? I was wondering what the script font they used
  in the opening credits isks like Chank&#39;s <a href="http://www.digitalriver.com/dr/v2/ec_MAIN.Entry10?xid=295&amp;PN=1&amp;SP=10023&amp;V1=23923&amp;DSP=&amp;CUR=840&amp;PGRP=0&amp;CACHE_ID=0"
  target="_blank"> Ah-Swee-Pay</a>, but i&#39;m not totally certain that it is. Anyone
  know for sure?

  body: no, not at all. it&#39;s similar to the script in the link in my posting above,
    but i&#39;m not positive that it&#39;s an exact match. This one seemed a bit more
    restrained, clean but had the bouncy baseline and unorthodox script forms &#40;the
    lc d was similar to Chank&#39;s a&#42;&#42;wipe. Sorry i never have samples of
    these things... would make it easier for ya, i&#39;m sure.

  body: looks like the same thing under a different name. this very well could be
    the one, but i was hoping someone could give me a definitive ID. i didn&#39;t
    notice all the curley cues on the caps in the credits, maybe i&#39;ll hafta sneak
    in for the opening credits next time i&#39;m at the theater &#40;it&#39;s not
    worth sitting through the whole movie, LOL&#41;

  body: I must be sick -- I didn&#39;t catch that Chank designed Chunder. Sorry about
    that. <BR> <BR>Alternately, you can browse Mike Yanega&#39;s <a href="http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html">directory
    of casual flowing scripts</a> and see whether you find what you&#39;re looking
    for there.

  body: i think it must be Chunder &#40;but i&#39;m not absolutely certian&#41; i
    think the lc d and the bouncy baseline make this one pretty unique. didn&#39;t
    see anything that matched in Mike&#39;s directory. How&#39;s he keep abreast on
    all those faces anyway?
