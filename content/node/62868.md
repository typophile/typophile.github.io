body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/natuursteen_4056.png]\r\n\r\nMy company
  wishes to use the above font in their company logo. Can you people tell me what
  feeling this font gives you? For example reliable/decent or cheap/outdated? The
  company makes/sells stone products (anything from monuments to custom made kitchen
  sinks).\r\n\r\nI'm curious as to what people think about it, I think it's time to
  go for a new font, but I'd like to know what other people think...\r\n\r\nTnx!"

    stone. And if you\u2019re Dutch, a font with a properly spaced j is kind of important."

    Suggestions about what type of fonts we should use are more than welcome :)

  body: "I am not sure why you would use a \"handwriting\" style font for a stone
    company's logo. It seems very casual, and not very professional or \"corporate\".
    \r\nWhen I think of stone products, I think of strenghth, industry, robust-ness.
    This is weak, friendly, casual to me. \r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

    choose some clean sans serif with strong forms. Check out Font Bureau's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude|Amplitude]]
    with its carved ink traps. It is quite a luxury to buy a stone monument or kitchen
    sink and I think the type needs to be much classier to reflect that."

    (And no, I'm not just saying this because of his name.)

    It looks like someone slapped out a sign for a drunken frathouse keg party. You
    need something sturdy and strong with some mass to it that befits stone--perhaps
    a heavy slab serif.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Aachen Bold.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/aachen/bold/characters.html\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "In response to Kate Dawson,\r\n\r\nDoes a company logo sell the product or
    the service?\r\n\r\nI would not likely approach a salesmen that came across as
    cold and inflexible. Consequently, I would suggest that this company might benefit
    from a logo that combines two styles. For example, a warm rounded font might be
    inset in a rigid and durable boundary or vice versa.\r\n\r\nMore to the point,
    we are deprived of seeing their current logo as it actually appears."

    it, but that's not to say that it or some other 'softer' font couldnt work if
    given the right treatment."
