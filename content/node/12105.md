  It's a terrible website. I know. I take full blame. My bad. But it was 2001 and
  I was in love. We all do things we regret. I will soon have the opportunity to fix
  that mistake. We'll talk more about that as the project progresses.\r\n\r\nBut what
  I want to talk about right now is our logo. For that I take no responsibility. That
  is not my child. \r\n\r\nMistral? The only reason that font was used was because
  it installed with Microsoft Word. And why do the P and L swirl around in a surfboard
  shape? When the owner of the company designs the logo, there's little for me to
  do but hang my head in shame.\r\n\r\nWe have made progress however. Exhibit <a href=\"http://www.prolooksports.com/newsite/images/PLLogo2005.gif\"
  target=\"_blank\">A</a>.\r\n\r\nOne of my coworkers managed to get this simplified
  version of the logo into use and I added the updated font. I still don't like the
  shape of the logo. I spend all my spare time doodling variations in an attempt to
  come up with something inspired. For some reason the P and the L perplex me.\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to fish for two things now. 1) You're remarks on the updated logo and where
  to go from here. 2) Ugly logos that you get stuck working with. I know we're not
  all <em>Pentagram</em> grade designers whose mere presence strikes fear in the heart
  of bad design. And so I know some of us have gotten stuck working with bad logos
  like me. Basically I'd like some sympathy. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have anything ugly
  to share, just throw something together and make up some story about how the client's
  neice designed it. It'll make me feel better."

    at that pile of garbage they call an identity. That's even after I cleaned it
    up and removed several unecessary elements. Luckily after two years I've convinced
    them to rebrand and I came up with a great new ID.\r\n\r\nIt's all a process,
    frustrating and headache inducing to say the least, but it'll happen if you can
    convince them in an intelligent manner of why they need to rebrand. Try to get
    some cheerleaders that are close to the boss too, that always helps.\r\n\r\nI
    feel your pain. Best of luck,\r\ntim"

    hold sway with the suits.\r\n\r\nYou should've seen the reactions I got when I
    changed the biz cards that were done by the CFO's wife. That made him real happy.
    But they needed to change.\r\n\r\nIt's just fun to share the joy. Keep up the
    good work."
