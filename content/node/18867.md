body: "When I worked for design firms I had worked on a nice amount of type setting
  and layout but I have noticed most of my freelance work has not been text heavy.
  My love of type and its proper setting has lead me to start pursuing work that involves
  more type instead of advertising and promotion. \r\nMy dilemma is that I don't have
  any idea of the fair market value for that sort of work on a per project basis.
  Since I would like to start working more in this field, I want to quote an excellent
  price. But I don't want to be left doing hours of work for free. \r\nI have two
  projects, a five volume set with about two to three hundred pages a section, with
  accompanying illustrations. And a one volume book with challenging translated text
  with running commentary and foot notes.\r\nIf anyone have resources for such numbers,
  or would be willing to share their own knowledge, I would be very thankful.\r\n"

  body: "Will you be doing design, layout, or just typesetting?\r\n\r\n7\xA2/word
    seems to be the going rate for straight typesetting (here in NY, book publishing).
    \r\n\r\nIllustrated book publishers pay between $20 and $50/page for design/layout
    (including typesetting). It depends on the complexity of the project. Some break
    it down to, say, $25/page plus 7\xA2/word or some such. Scanning is extra.\r\n\r\nHope
    this is helpful."

  body: "Pattyfab,\r\nIt sure is helpful. I would be doing the design, layout, and
    setting. I just wanted to add a shamless compliment. Besides the fact that I just
    happen to have read quite a few of the books which you designed - your book designs
    are truly stunning. I would be proud to have worked on such projects. Would you
    have any advice on how to start in that direction? "

  body: "Wow, thanks! I've been at it for 20 years now and on my own for almost 6.
    Advice... I'd try to target publishers that do the kind of books that interest
    you but must warn you it can be VERY hard to break through to the art directors.
    Having been one myself I know that they get kind of lazy - in that they tend to
    use designers they already know well rather than taking a chance on someone new
    despite the talent or qualifications. There are still publishers that should be
    hiring me and aren't despite pleasant meetings and promises. I don't take it personally
    (it's their loss) and am grateful to the good clients I do have. I hate that part
    of the job - hustling for new clients - but it has to be done rigorously. Nothing
    more frustrating than seeing a bad design on a really cool book and KNOWING I
    could have done it better.\r\n\r\nAlso recommend you put up a web site if you
    haven't already.\r\n\r\nAnd - if you're just starting out - don't turn any job
    down. It's really fun most of the time even to design a boring book, you can still
    make it the best you can and be proud of it, even if it's not the one you show
    all your friends in the bookstore. Plus you get the practice."
