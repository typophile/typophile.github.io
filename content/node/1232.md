body: Hey everyone, it&#39;s my first time posting here. I&#39;ve started working
  on a logo for a dentist and want to avoid showing a tooth or tooth brush and all
  of that. From what I know, he is an older dentist and would want something more
  on the conservative side. He is one of the only dentists in the region who does
  cosmetic dentistry &#40;teeth whitening, replacing silver fillings with white ones
  and so on&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Let me know what you think. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15915.gif"

  body: Hi David! I really like the mc monogram. One thing you could try on that is
    using a heaver &#34;c&#34;. <BR> <BR>The horizontal rule and type alignment, however,
    are unbalanced. You might be better off eliminating the line and center-aligning
    &#34;Michael Contardo&#34; with the monogram. A smaller point size might help
    the balance, too. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: I&#39;m not sure that dropping the right leg of the &#34;M&#34; is adding
    anything to the logo. I guess it is a bit distracting to me. I agree that the
    monogram is nice. <BR> <BR>mb

  body: To me, that extended leg on the M gives it character.  It&#39;s a conservative
    logo, but it has just a dash of playfulness in it.

    monogram and played around with the shape a bit. I like the top left one, but
    my main concern is that it

  body: The Logo is a bit generic. Although I don&#39;t think that a logo necessariyl
    has to say anything about the client, maybe there is a way of showing what he
    doesn without the old teethe&amp;brush clich

    Experiment with some more colours - even an unusual colour like maroon or taupe
    might look nice. <BR> <BR>Paul

    between the name and the monogram and i think it worked nicely. Again, thanks

  body: I appreciate the simplicity of your design. I do like these new colors as
    well. My only comment -- and don&#39;t mind be proved wrong -- is that I read
    &#34;mc&#34; as in a last name McCahalan or something like that. I think it is
    because the &#39;c&#39; appears smaller than the &#39;m&#39;.

    <BR>Also, the latest color palette is great. Fresh without being  <BR>too minty.
