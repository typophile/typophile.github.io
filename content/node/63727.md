  full of nonsense generated text and probably dodgy links. They usually give themselves
  away by their strange titles, so I could ignore them, but they really annoy me,
  and I hope you can do something about it! Thanks :)\r\n\r\nI guess I could have
  sent this to the admin as well, but I guess it's good to warn all beforehand.\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress/|infraordinaire]]"

    an email is the quickest way (and most approved way) to get rid of the offending
    posts.
