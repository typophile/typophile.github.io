    so presumably that was your intention. :)

    much time at all on this design. I have tried band \"logos\" before, and they
    are tough. I would suggest spending an hour or more sketching and refining sketches.
    Put away the computer for a while and think about the message you are communicating.\r\n\r\nevan\r\n<a

  body: "Thanks a lot for the replies.\r\n\r\nI get the same feeling as Nick, that
    it \"wants\" to have more going on, but I can't quite put my finger on what that
    \"more\" is yet.\r\n\r\nEvan, I spent about six hours on this. I stayed with my
    original idea of tight, bold lowercase Helvetica but the look went through some
    changes. I also played around with various \"worn\" looks, from worn paper to
    worn cloth before settling on the clean version. Once that was done, I played
    around with the box around it for quite a while. \r\nI love design and especially
    working with type, but I'm a musician and I don't do this for a living, so the
    gaps in my education have to be filled with a lot of tinkering. I understand that
    it probably would've taken a designer twenty minutes to go through the process
    I went through, but I'm slow with this stuff. :) (And paper's not an option. I
    can't draw my way out of a wet paperbag.)\r\n\r\nBy \"neutral,\" I meant that
    it's not like grunged up blackletter -- you see something like that, you know
    it's going to have distorted guitars and screeching on it.\r\n\r\nSo -- any ideas
    for some kind of \"more\" for this, anyone?\r\n\r\nAnd the kerning's OK then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to advise.  The good part about designing a band logo is that you always have
    the option to remake your look form album to album, which most bands do.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    you may want to consider writing your band's name as \"central\" instead of \"Central\"
    to provide connection between the logo and the name in print.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

    band.\r\nIn my opinion there's nothing \"neutral\", no distorted guitar and no
    blackletter doesn't mean neutral, it's just another meaning.\r\nSo, where we can
    listen at you music?\r\nI'm very curious.\r\n____\r\n\r\nMC"

    very 2008. If you think (or want others to think) of your band as definitive 2008,
    you've nailed it. For example, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_%28New_Order_album%29|Substance]]
    is definitive 1987. Or at least that's what they intended, very obviously, it
    seems.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Oops. You asked about the kerning...\r\n\r\nAs for the kerning, the general
    rule, as far as I know, is not to kern lowercase. I'd type it and let it be. Did
    you squeeze the middle letters together? It looks a little forced and cramped.
    The negative space between the r and a and within the n call unnecessary attention
    to the lack of negative space on either side of the t. Considering all of that,
    I'd loosen it up a bit around the t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: To me the name is a bit "neutral" so I would try to make the logo a bit more
    interesting. Just think it out on paper first - even if you cannot draw, you can
    conceptualize in a way that you understand.

  body: "1.  I think esthetic is spelled aesthetic.\r\n\r\n2.  Why does your band
    need a logo?\r\n\r\n3.  Not enough space between the \"ntr\".\r\n\r\nBoring? not
    quite.  The logo says web2.0, which in turn says corporate target market 18-24,
    which in turn says conventional.  Of course, I would avoid doing anything else
    to it.  My take is that logos are not very rock and roll, as they traditionally
    used to sell stuff to people you haven't met.  Most people like to think of music
    as a one off gig, a relationship, a two-way thing. Logos say the opposite. They
    say \"I know I can't pick you out of a crowd and even if you spoke back I can't
    hear you.  This is great when purchasing hemorrhoid cream, not so great when trying
    to get a band off the ground.  Even INXS needed to start facing the crowds. \r\n\r\nThis
    does not mean that band logos never work.  Radiohead, after Kid A has used the
    same hand drawn all caps logo in subsequent albums without feeling corporate.
    \ Who can forget Weezer's successful co-option of the Van Halen logo in a clever
    juxtaposition of indie rock and 80's mega band.  The success stories are few and
    far between however, for every one radio-heads there are 10 Maroon-5s.\r\n\r\nIf
    what you are going for is an element of subversion, I can see your logo working
    well.    Especially for un-listenable noise rock.  A kind of \"ha-ha we tricked
    you with our logo\" bent.  If that is not the case, I would move away from perfection
    and introduce some esoteric elements to suggest that you don't care so much about
    the logo.  It would be far more rock and roll.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@cjeder: I think esthetic can also be spelled aesthetic, but no matter.  \"Aesthetic\"
    is clearly the better spelling.  The good part of band logos is that they can
    be reworked for each album, if not whim.  So regardless if it's very 2008, it
    works for the moment.  Perhaps that was your point?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    at it. I think this is the worst thing you want when looking at a band logo...
    \r\n\r\nif the logo looks neutral, the music is probably too. how do you expect
    that to interest people if it's set in the same font as most signage? \r\n\r\nI
    also can't believe you spent 6 hours on that. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.counterfeitchic.com/Images/Yeasayer.jpg

  body: "I know everyone is bashing the \"neutral\" idea. The logo looks like it belongs
    on the sleeve of a tee shirt...so as a t-shirt company's logo it would be wonderful.
    Those are meant to be simple.\r\n\r\nI'd say if you are designing it yourself,
    put yourself into it. Helvetica is a great default font because it is (#1) a GREAT
    font, lots of history and refining went into this. (#2) it's a sponge. It can
    be anything, in a sense. SOOOOO MANY companies use Helvetica in their logos. So
    it's not a bad font per se, but if you get the choice why not play around and
    explore some other fonts? A logo should speak without you there, especially a
    band logo I would think.\r\n\r\nI also think a big problem with the logo is the
    word. I mean Central doesn't shout \"band\"! Paired with helvetica in a lower
    caps, gray background, white lettering, overall smooth feeling, I'm thinking coffee
    shop. I'm not suggesting you change your band name of course, I am just laying
    that out there on the table as a possible issue to consider."

  body: If you decide to go with the Helvetica logo, in the context of your site,
    I think left aligning the page is the way to go. There is something about centered
    Helvetica that doesn't seem right, probably because I was extremely influenced
    by Swiss design in school.

  body: Is your music "neutral."? Does your music have soul? White lowercase Helvetica
    in gray background, very soulless. I like the lowercase Helvetica but make it
    a stencil, spray paint it on things... be a rebel, that's rock and roll!!
