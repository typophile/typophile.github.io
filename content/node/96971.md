body: "The figure below was obtained in Word using the Arial font. They show, first
  the LATIN SMALL LETTER A (0061) progressively combined with the diacritics COMBINING
  ACUTE ACCENT (0301), COMBINING TILDE (0303) and COMBINING OVERLINE (0305). When
  I try the same combination with the GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA (03B1), one can see
  that the COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT is placed normally on top and at the center of the
  character \u03B1. But afterwards the diacritics are displaced to the right and upwards.
  Why does the Arial font do this ? What is the purpose of these displacements ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/combining

    body: "Quadibloc\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply. I certainly agree with you, specially
      because of this paragraph, on pages 44/45 of [[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf|Chapter
      2 General Structure of the Unicode document]] :\r\n\r\n\"<cite>Such override
      behavior is associated with specific scripts or alphabets. For example, when
      used with the Greek script, the \u201Cbreathing marks\u201D U+0313  combining
      comma above (psili) and U+0314 combining reversed comma above (dasia) require
      that, when used together with a following acute or grave accent, they be rendered
      side-by-side rather than the accent marks being stacked above the breathing
      marks. The order of codes here is base character code + breathing mark code
      + accent mark code. This example demonstrates the script-dependent or writing-system-dependent
      nature of rendering combining diacritical marks.</cite>\".\r\n\r\nBut I believe
      that this does not necessarily imply the displacements shown on the picture
      above, or at least, there must be some explanation justifying those displacements."

  body: "When you enter lowercase alpha + combining acute, the Microsoft layout engine
    is automatically mapping this sequence to the precomposed alphatonos character
    (U+03AC). This is typical behaviour for any Unicode diacritics with canonical
    decompositions, since it is faster to display the precomposed characters than
    to go via GSUB or GPOS.\r\n\r\nWhat your illustration indicates to me is that
    something in the Arial glyph lookups subsequently breaks this precomposed display
    contextually when followed by a second combining mark. This would be the case
    if the intention was to avoid having to define GPOS mark-to-base attachment lookups
    for every precomposed diacritic, and is something that I have done in Cambria
    and Brill (but which turns out to cause a problem with a bug in InDesign, acknowledged
    by Adobe but not yet fixed). I presume whomever did the Arial OTL work for Microsoft
    used a similar technique. What happens in such a situation is that mark-to-base
    positioning of the first combining mark to the letter is applied, and then mark-to-mark
    for each subsequent combining mark.\r\n\r\nIn your illustration, I reckon what
    is happening is that the font does not contain correct mark-to-base positioning
    for the combining acute relative to the alpha, and hence when the precomposed
    diacritic first displayed is decomposed, that mark ends up in the wrong place.
    The subsequent marks are positioned relative to the acute correctly, but the whole
    stack is in the wrong place relative to the letter."

  body: "I would explain the first new image in the same way as before: it looks like
    the alphas with individual marks are being rendered using precomposed alphavaria
    and alphabreve characters from the polytonic set, but that this is somehow being
    inhibited by the addition of a second mark.\r\n\r\nWithout analysing the lookup
    structures in detail, I can't say exactly what is going on."

    body: I didn't realize there was a precomposed greek character canonically equivalent
      to the combination of the GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA (03B1) with the COMBINING
      GRAVE ACCENT (0300), which is the character GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH VARIA
      (1F70). But I couldn't find in Unicode any character called "GREEK SMALL LETTER
      ALPHA WITH BREVE".
