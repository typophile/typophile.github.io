body: "I am looking an example of a well designed layout for a dictionary definition.
  I attached a photo of an example. Does anyone know of or have examples of printed
  definitions with carefully chosen typography and spacing? Or digital examples? perhaps
  the heading on a webpage, where the main heading is the business's name (i.e. pentagram)
  and beneath the heading is the pronuncation (i.e. /\u02C8pen(t)\u0259\u02CC\u0261ram/)
  along with the type of speech (i.e.), the definition itself, and the origin of the
  word (i.e. origin: Greek, \"pentagrammon\").\r\n\r\nThey can be non traditional
  layouts as well. I am mainly looking for font pairings. I realize this is very specific,
  but any help would be much appreciated. Even if you can't find examples perhaps
  suggestions of font pairings, spacing, what words to italicize etc.\_"

    A lot of the older dictionaries were the better ones as they included the etymology
    of the word. '
