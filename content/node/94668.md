  up both Metrics and Kerning. I understand that metrics is all about adjusting the
  left and right side bearings, and the Kerning is used to make that space even more
  snug for combinations like AV. But what is really getting me messed up is how to
  approach setting up my typefaces metrics what do I reference each glyph to and how
  do I know that my metrics are where they should be?\r\n\r\nAre kerning and metric
  classes usually the same?\r\n\r\nWhat is your approach for setting up metrics and
  kerning for a typeface generally?"

    you have your spacing looking good, add kerning for the troublesome combinations."
