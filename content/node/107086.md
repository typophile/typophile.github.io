  on typographic 'Niceties'\x10\x10 however came up a bit short. Everyone knows typography
  is one of the des\x10\x10\x10\x10igner's core tools. The designer uses type to communicate
  appropriately, to suggest a mood and a character and to contribute to page and layout
  dynamics, for both printed and screen based formats such as a tablet or smart phone.
  its obvious understanding the rules and key facts of typographic detailing will
  create better communication with the read/viewer.\r\n\r\nGood typography should
  be invisible, yet typography should grab the reader's attention using imaginative
  solutions.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find examples that explore this through the application
  of different formats (print or digital), layout, hierarchy and color ways and how
  the correct use of typographic detailing, aids communication and readability. I
  would greatly appreciate your opinions here and would also like to discuss and know
  why you think that your example is successful."
