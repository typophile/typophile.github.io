body: "I need to trim the tail from an italic lowercase f using monotype modern bold
  italic ('original' below). It isn't my preference to do so, but it is the lesser
  of 2 evils on a project with a fast-approaching deadline. Which of these do you
  think works? Do you think it should taper at all? Or should it be the same width
  right to the bottom?\r\n\r\nHere are pics for the original, 1 (some), 2 (less),
  3 (less still).\r\n\r\nAlternately, could anyone suggest a lowercase f that doesn't
  have a tail that would match this?\r\nthanks in advance!\r\nJennifer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/orig_4256.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6725.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5434.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5403.png]"

    right while trying to keep the weight right as well. One option might be to build
    some haphazard swash character and avoid the descender completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SFU_4020.gif]\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure someone will bring it to our attention if this a particularly awful idea."

  body: If you have to crop it, I think it should be at the baseline. Leaving any
    more just calls attention to what's missing.

  body: "Yeah, the recognizable part of a typeface (glyphs in this case) is the upper
    part. There is a classic test, where they cut off either the bottom half of a
    line of type or the upper half. ANd then let people read these lines.\r\nMost
    of the recognition aspects are in the upper parts.\r\n\r\nPersonal opinion: cut
    off at baseline does it for me.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "I did try trimming at the baseline, but the result looks confused, as though
    the f belongs to a different family altogether. It kind of kills the 'lively'
    in it. The descender, even trimmed flat, still contributes grace and movement.
    Here is the trimmed version in (partial) context. It feels right to me.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new_4968.png]\r\n\r\nps.
    I am aware of and addressing other inconsistencies in this piece :)\r\n"

  body: "It looks great, especially the way you've integrated it into the design,
    which apparently was the whole point of the exercise.\r\nIt's nice that it's at
    a slightly different angle--puts some tension in the layout and gets it moving."

    I liked the hook, but I suppose it could be too show-offy. At any rate, I'm fine
