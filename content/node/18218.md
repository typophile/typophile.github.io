body: "Good evening.\r\n\r\nI am a first semester Design student from Mexico looking
  for visual reference for late 19th century types and letterform designs.\r\n\r\nI
  was fortunate enough to find some good listings (and samples of the most popular
  ones like Kismet and Nymphic) by John F. Cumming, Hermann Ihlenburg and from the
  Mackellar Smiths & Jordan foundry. On the latter I was particularly pleased to find
  this web site ( http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/mackellar/ ) which list a good number
  of types featured in the \"The Compact Book of Specimens\".\r\n\r\nNow my problem
  is that I have yet to find any sort of on-line visual reference for a lot of these,
  as some don't seem to have been digitalized yet (to my knowledge). I found quite
  a few 'variations' though but not much examples of the originals.\r\n\r\nSeeing
  as this is a good place to ask for assistance I humbly request any sort of URL with
  data or images of letterforms and typefaces from that period, as I will be trying
  to list them for part of a presentation by image example, name, year of patent and
  designer.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you very much."

  body: "I think the sheer range of Ihlenburg's work is just amazing. I have always
    been fascinated by his stuff. The Cary Library at RIT has an archive of personal
    files of his, including sketches of unpublished work. But I don't think any of
    that is online. There was also a nice article by David Pankow on Ihlenburg's work
    that appeared in \"The Ampersand\" vol 13 number 3-4, Fall/Winter 1993-94.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if that helps any.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Online resources are difficult to locate; however, you can purchase some excellent
    reproduction specimen books from David Peat for quite reasonable prices ($4-20
    each, with multi-unit discounts available). Send him an SASE to get a catalog
    sheet at 1225 Carroll White Drive, Indianapolis IN 46219; or you can get a partial
    listing and Mr. Peat's email address <a href="http://www.briarpress.org/cgi-bin/briarpress/show.cgi?db=direct&uid=default&view_records=1&Category=Books:%20reference&nh=7&mh=1"

  body: "My suggestion is to use some of the font sites that allow searching by keywords,
    such as MyFonts.com, and use terms like '19th century', Art Nouveau. Victorian,
    Old West, Antique and see what you find. There are many designers/digitizers,
    like Dan Solo, Nick Curtis, Jim Spiece, <a href=\"http://freefonts.fateback.com/george_williams/\">George
    Williams</a>, David Nalle and others who have mined the 19th century for many
    designs. The problem is that only some of them are good about documenting the
    sources.\r\n\r\nIf you have some good books, such as the Dover book by Ludwig
    Petzendorfer called 'Treasury of Authentic Art Nouveau Alphabets', then it is
    usually pretty easy to correlate the fonts to their original typefaces.\r\n\r\n-
