  aware it's maybe a bit controversial because unicode doesn't support it but anyhow.
  \ I'm interested if there is one."

      your web page.)\r\n\r\nQamats qatan is easy\u2014Unicode supports it.\r\n Sheva\u2014I
      suppose you can display LETTER+SHEVA+RAFE as LETTER+SHEVA NA; maybe also identify
      shevas under the first letter of a word.\r\nDagesh\u2014I guess you display
      the dagesh differently in letter which take a kal <i>vs.</i> chazaq?"
