  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Am I getting old or what? Yeah, It&#39;s rhetorical. <BR> <BR>I seem to be finding a lot of examples of bad color choices with type. The latest example that drove me nuts was from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design catalog for continuing education classes. Dark yellow type on lilac. You can download the equally irritating pdf by clicking on the &#34;Summer Course Catalog&#34; link from this page: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mcad.edu/continue/fs-continue.htm</a> <BR> <BR>It reminds me of a local eatery called  The French Meadow Bakery -- their coffee menu is written in brick red chalk on a black chalkboard. I told a friend, &#34;If I hadn&#39;t had any, I sure as heck wouldn&#39;t be able to order it from that!&#34; <BR></div>

I wanted it to be jarring, though, and it was only the headline.  <BR> <BR>I printed your catalog out on the color xerox, and the orange died a little, so the print-out is almost readable.  <BR> <BR>The cool thing about this is that it makes me feel good about my designs.</div>

Most of the entries, as usual, were pretty, but lacked in all sorts of other design criteria &#40;usability, accessibility, functionality, etc.&#41;.

		<div class="commentbody">To get back to the MCAD page. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mind the color scheme. You can do things with RGB that you can&#39;t in print. <BR> <BR>But the real weakness with the type at the bottom is this: It is set in Base, famously with &#34;media specific&#34; versions -- and yet the face is not bitmapping correctly here, it is incorrectly used.

I think it&#39;s OK to go overboard, but it&#39;s not OK to make something unreadable in the process. Maybe I&#39;ve turned into a hack, but I always ask myself, &#34;Is this doing anything to enhance communication?&#34; If it&#39;s not helping, it gets cut. If it&#39;s actively hindering communication, it gets cut, thrown on the floor and stomped.  <BR> <BR>The orange on purple text in the pdf is almost impossible to read. The printout on my color printer is difficult to read. Without the actual printed piece, I don&#39;t know how difficult it was to read, but judging from Krisin&#39;s original reaction, it wasn&#39;t good. <BR> <BR>If a client is paying for a design, I think the designer has an obligation to make it usable/readable. An unreadable piece might not be vanilla, but it&#39;s probably not a success. <BR> <BR>Nick: are you talking about the cover, or the insides?</div>
