  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">O.k., i really dont have much of an idea what to do.  I have made a font &#40;in 4 weights&#41; and am in the process of making others.  They are not amazing, but they are my first so i suppose that&#39;s o.k. <BR> <BR>I am wondering, when i get my website set up...how do i get a &#39;license&#39; or whatever i need to be able to sell my fonts, and generally what do i need altogether, so i have &#39;ownership&#39; of the fonts, &#40;or what all the other companys have&#41; <BR> <BR>at the moment i just have fonts on my computer, but when i get some good started and finished, i would like to be able to sell them...i need to know everything involved, please. <BR> <BR>&#40;by the way i&#39;m only 15, would that be any trouble?&#41; <BR> <BR>i did look around the forum for about 15 minutes, but couldn&#39;t find a relevant topic to exactly what i need, i may just be blind though</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s different in the UK, but over here in the US if you made it, it&#39;s yours. You can sell it any which way you choose: through a credit-card setup on your site, by licensing it through a font house &#40;like MyFonts; but then you lose some rights/money&#41;, or even eBay I guess! You do have to pay taxes on sales &#40;unless your total income is too small to qualify&#41;; and you might need a business license, but over here at least you can get away without that - or at most you should do a Doing-Business-As &#34;ficticious business name&#34; setup &#40;costs around $75 or something&#41;. Maybe your best bet is to simply walk into your town/county offices and ask them what your laws are. Or a Brit Typophiler can assist you with the details. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
