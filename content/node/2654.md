body: Some time ago I read that one of the regular posters here has developed corporate
  ID for the L&#39;Occitane. Can he or anyone else tell me what is their &#34;corporate&#34;
  font? I regularly do some advertising for them, but the local distributors know
  little about their graphic standards.

    I&#39;m interested about the serif face.

  body: Might have been me you are refering to. Hrant and I had a conversation some
    time ago about this. <BR> <BR>I did a lot of stuff for them. Mostly Store front
    &amp; environmental design. Indeed it is Adobe Garamond small caps. Indeed the
    sc x hieght is a little larger. and the &#39;O&#39; was thinkened just slightly
    to accomodate for the larger xheight.

  body: Tnx for the help. I have a different version of Garamond installed and apparently
    it has some minor differences from the Adobe Garamond, so I thought maybe it&#39;s
    something else.
