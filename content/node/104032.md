  I am in my abilities as a graphic designer. I go to the streets of capitalism and
  find some young people, 18-24 or so, who are just starting out in life with their
  hopes and dreams still intact and offer my services. I find this exercise very interesting
  and completely invigorating because it is wise to never get comfortable with your
  accomplishments ...especially when you cross over 35 years of age. Becoming a comfortable
  fixture of the establishment is never a good idea ...as a designer one must stay
  vital! And the great thing about this type of marketing technique is that the youth
  have no trouble telling you your work is shit ...or not.\r\n\r\nSo I found myself
  talking to a young wannabe fashion designer who is currently slaving away in a retail
  box store. Male, 20, Asian Canadian, and as I was to discover ...super talented
  and sophisticated. This business meeting ...if you will, was conducted in the middle
  of a show room floor in front of his co-workers and other shoppers milling about
  ...as informal and non-partial a business meeting as it gets ...completely out of
  the blue.\r\n\r\nI said to him ...I can design your Identity ...and we can build
  you a brand. All I need from you is your initials and some background. He told his
  name and his initials JYC and that his parents are from Malaysia. I said awesome!
  I'll be back with a prospective Identity...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm not a professional graphic designer, but my impression is that there's
    some room for improvement. The basic architecture of the mark, incorporating the
    three initials, is a good start. The beef I have with it is mostly in the execution.\r\n\r\nAt
    what sizes do you intend the logo to be used? The thick strokes of the letters
    would in principle allow it to work at very small sizes, but then the small-scale
    parts of the logo (such as the clutter of vertices near the intersections) would
    be lost. You could get more impact by simplifying those areas a bit and making
    the white borders thicker. On the other hand, if you intend for the logo to be
    presented at large sizes, as in these images, then its details need more refinement
    to withstand scrutiny. \r\n\r\nThe strokes intersect at a somewhat steeper angle
    in the bottom crossing than in the top one. Is that intentional? I'd either make
    the angles the same, or more different. Currently, it looks like it might have
    happened by accident.\r\n\r\nThere's a similar issue with the bottom stroke ends.
    \ They have a similar width as the verticals of the \"waist\", but not the same.
    I suggest you try making them the same width, or making them unambiguously wider.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not quite sure what the hexagons do \u2014 I believe the mark would be stronger
    without them. If you keep them, I'd suggest making them into regular hexagons
    (currently they're elongated vertically) and enlarging\r\nthem so that they don't
    feel out of place next to the big fat strokes. I could also imagine that upright
    squares would work even better."

  body: IMO, it got this fairly strong paramilitary feel to it. I'm guessing because
    it looks like a twist of a barbed wire and, more generally, because it's a simple
    sharp shape, in black and white.

  body: "<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/JYC_cc.jpg \">\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments! \r\n\r\nCatharsis, I appreciate the time and effort you took
    to explain your view ...and ya, there's a bunch of very strong undertones to this
    design.\r\n\r\nBut first I'd like to explain the difference between a grunt of
    a design ...as yours truly is... and a sophisticated design. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    strokes intersect at a somewhat steeper angle in the bottom crossing than in the
    top one. Is that intentional? </blockquote>\r\n\r\nFirstly, this mark has a harmonious
    upward movement. The elements which constitute the upward movement actually begin
    with those three horizontal 'elongated' hexagons, but the stronger visual element
    is the difference in the segments of stroke angles of the letter shapes themselves.
    Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the visual contrast between the base and
    middle sections against the upward open upper section.\r\n\r\nAnd those effects
    are achieved by first establishing strong horizontals. Note the red lines ...they
    indicate only two of the half dozen or so subtle visual clues which together establish
    strong (and hence calm) horizontals. Your effort seems unsettlingly wobbly (not
    to mention the compromise you had to make in the disproportionate amounts of the
    middle section of the J and C). And your effort is fat, perhaps too dense is the
    correct phrase, in the middle (a cultural statement?), and that fat arrests the
    eye and challenges/overpowers the upper section.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There's a
    similar issue with the bottom stroke ends. ... I suggest you try making them the
    same width, or making them unambiguously wider.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWider perhaps
    ...but not by much. Those elements can't be seen to overstate their position of
    the fundamental letters in composition as a whole.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'm not
    quite sure what the hexagons do \u2014 I believe the mark would be stronger without
    them. If you keep them, I'd suggest making them into regular hexagons (currently
    they're elongated vertically) and enlarging them so that they don't feel out of
    place next to the big fat strokes. I could also imagine that upright squares would
    work even better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMy thoughts of those marks was fourfold.
    Firstly, they correctly represent the three periods after each letter J.Y.C. ...and
    secondly they have a rhythmic compliment to all that is above ...and thirdly they
    are a horizontal base to/of the whole composition. The shape the hexagons is also
    of the whole, in fact their angles are of the lower part of the letter shapes
    strokes ...but ya they need not be elongated.\r\n\r\nAnd just one further comment
    of the undertones ...on the not stencil version ...YO... as in, sup yo???\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying your effort is pointless Catharsis, please don't get me wrong, and
    again I thank you for the time and effort, it is my hope that someday you will
    experience graphic design in broader more meaningful depth ...the world is being
    reduced to nothing more than collective grunts at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nAnd
    one last comment ...about the overall concept. It was a complete fluke that this
    design was so in tune with a Buddha sitting in the Lotus/Contemplative position.
    Or about being of the strong and wonderful contribution Asia has given to the
    world in regards to the weaving of Bamboo ...and the awesome patterns that come
    from such structures. Or about reference to urban aesthetics such as chain link
    fences. Or about sexual undertones neither.\r\n\r\nAnd yet ...it's all there ;)

    body: "<blockquote>But first I'd like to explain the difference between a grunt

      would be alarming if my 5-minute mockup sketch were to look any less than a
      \"grunt of a design\".  ;o) Don't worry about the lack of lateral symmetry,
      it was not part of my suggestion. What was, though, was the fact that widening
      the white borders around the strokes wider might help make the logo more work
      better at small sizes and avoid the clutter of vertices at the insides of the
      intersection\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Firstly, this mark has a harmonious upward movement.

      can see what you mean about the different angles producing an unraveling \"motion\"
      upwards. My suggestion was rather based on the assumption that you were going
      for a \"rugged cargo\" look (which young streetware labels often go for) rather
      than a \"lotus buddha\" look \u2014 the black angular strokes evoke iron girders
      to me. How about smoothing those kinks into curves?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JYC_6254.png]\r\n\r\n...too
      pornographic, though?  ;o)  (Again, don't worry about the poorly matched curvatures
      at the cut-offs near the intersections; it's still only a 5-minute mockup.)\r\n\r\nI
      disagree about the hexagons, though. To me, they don't harmonize with the strokes,
      or contribute to their rhythm. They are too flimsy to form a base for the much
      more massive strokes above; if anything, they evoke a row of nails to me, as
      if the mark above had been nailed to a wooden board like an elk's head...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'm

      I appreciate the thought you put into your design, as well as the time you took
      to explain it to me (albeit in a condescending tone). I don't think it comes
      across as well as it could, though.\r\n"
