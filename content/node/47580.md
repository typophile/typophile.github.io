body: "hey \r\nI'm looking for a suitable font for a 5 star hotel, the hotel design
  is Art Nouveau is style so something that is decretive but still has a stylish,
  sophisticated look and feel. All advice welcome or if anyone has seen something
  similar I'd love to have a look. Maybe a font designed in the 1920's as thats when
  the hotel was built? Look forward to hearing!\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\n"

    more in the Art Deco direction, but isn't the 1920's a bit late for Art Nouveau?\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "hey thanks for your help, \r\n\r\nI suppose art deco would better describe
    it. \r\n\r\nHere is what I have been working on. The hotel its self is broken
    up into 3 sections so I looked at this for inspiration. Its also in Malta and
    only 3 of Malta's Islands are inhabited by people (as far as I know) Anyway let
    me know what you think \r\n\r\nThanks [img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5776.jpg]"

  body: "Hi There\r\n\r\nThe element (and color) you show has an upper class feel.
    It looks a bit like a crown, but I think it could be refined. Perhaps some shapes
    of the mentioned islands?\r\n\r\nBut there is no coherency between the 'crown'
    and the fonts used. The ratio of the image and the type. See my image. \r\n\r\nEspecialy
    the upper version strikes me as a bit odd.\r\n\r\nThe lowest looks much better
    (much classier), but the typography used is somewhat common. Not always a bad
    thing, though.\r\n\r\nHave you looked at lowercase lettering?\r\n\r\nThe idea
    of three inhabited islands is a good find. But be 100% sure of that. It will be
    a selling point and you don't want the customer to tell you otherwise. \r\n\r\nCould
    you explain the 'crown'? What does it represent?\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck.\r\n\r\nRaymond\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Naamloos-1_3554.jpg]"

    to me in a way that the first 2 samples do not.  They become too thematic in my
    mind.  My 2 cents."
