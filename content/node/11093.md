  body: ' I like the white on white thing in the background and how it shows up against
    the dark gray. Lit from behind, I&#39;m sure it looked really good. I like Steelfish
    to set a classy mood. Just wondering: Did the club consider identity for &#39;atmosphere&#39;?
    An &#39;atmosphere&#39; logo might be considered. <BR> <BR>Overall, I like that
    we are getting to see design projects and designers posting their work. <BR> <BR>Looking
    forward to seeing your site. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
